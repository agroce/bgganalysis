Only managed to get this to the table once so far, enjoyed it but there was a distinct lack of player interaction. Hoping that Pirates and Bounty Hunters will help fix that.

EDIT: Pirates and Bounty Hunters definitely improves the game, adding a good dose of player interaction, the faster ship is definitely massively overpowered though

The game doesn't get to the table very often because the sessions are long, but we just love being immersed in the Verse. Maybe you have to be a Firefly fan to love it - I don't know - but we are and we do. However, I don't think just putting a theme or license you love on a game by default makes it a good game. I love "The Princess Bride" but I haven't found a game with that theme that I felt was very good. "Firefly: The Game" not only lets us live in that universe again, one that was taken from us way too soon, but the game play is fun. I need to hire a crew and get supplies so I can travel to places to get missions and complete missions and avoid Reavers. We love it.

RATING: 8
Not as long as people say, if you're playing with some sense. I like the combination of relatively relaxing gameplay vs the stress of racing for the victory condition.

RATING: 9
Virtually everyone else has already said it, but it's still true: If you love the show, you'll love the game. I love the show, so I have a hard time saying how I'd feel about the game if I didn't.

The common criticism that I've heard is that there's low player interaction. I mostly agree; the interaction is indirect and/or friendly such as it is in Catan (I can send a hostile unit against you, I can take something you want before you get to it, even if it's primarily to benefit myself, and I can trade with you so that we both get what we need).

What I dislike about the game the most is that so many crew, ships and gear are generic. You can hire as many gun hands, enforcers and scrappers as you want, and equip them with pistols, explosive charges and improvised hacking rigs. I'd have preferred each gun hand to have his own name and to have a make and model for the guns, even if they were just made up by GF9. They also left out several major guest characters.

As far as gameplay goes, a method of attacking other crews in the official rules would have been nice, but I have a feeling that may be coming in an expansion.

Even with the generic crew and gear, there is still plenty of unique crew, captains and gear, as well as a variety of different story cards that will lead to extensive replay.

RATING: 6
Has some nice parts - including lovely components, but overly tied to its theme in a rather literal and unimaginative way. It isn't really about running a tramp freighter in the Firefly universe, it's more just a way for fans of the TV show to revisit their memories of it. The gameplay itself is too simplistic, and the events that occur make for a somewhat incoherent collage of things copied directly from the show and seen exclusively through the eyes of its characters.

RATING: 8.5
Uno de los mejores ameritrash que he probado, de los más temáticos donde sientes como estás jugando identificándote con las aventuras de la serie, en la posición de capitán de una nave Firefly.
Dos acciones por jugador en el turno, que no se pueden repetir: volar, comprar tripulantes/equipo, conseguir nuevas misiones, realizar trabajos. 
Elección de objetivos finales de la partida, decenas de cartas de tripulantes, equipamiento nave/tripulantes, mejoras de la nave, etc.
Tensión por el crucero de la alianza y por la nave de los reavers.
En definitiva mucha variedad e inmersión en un juego cargado de mucho azar (cartas cuando vuelas, dado) que implica en este caso tensión, emoción y diversión.
No esperéis grandes mecánicas, es básicamente un pick-up & deliver como mecánica principal, tipo el Merchant of Venus, pero mucho mas abierto y con más libertad, y con pruebas continuas de cartas para tirar un dado donde se suma la habilidad de la tripulación y su equipación que hubierais adquirido. 
A mi gusto le falta eso sí más elementos de interacción, como el que tiene de comprar a los jugadores descontentos de otro jugador si compartes mismo espacio.

PD: Imprescindible ver la serie y luego la película Serenity para involucrarse más.

After 1 play, I have to note that this game is off-the-hook crazy fun. I cannot wait to get more games in.

Subsequent plays have confirmed my initial belief. Firefly The Game is super good fun. While it is component heavy (3 decks of cards and counting) it is amazingly easy to play.

RATING: 7
Another one of those amazing games I rarely get on the table due to it's complexity and time requirement.

I'm a Browncoat, so I immediately took to this game. The theming is obviously done with great love and attention, and it shows. This isn't a reskin of a boring game with TV characters plastered on. This game is a ground-up creation, factoring in many critical moments, characters, and issues from the show. If you're a Firefly fan, you should check this out.

Pros:
- Theme: As I said, WONDERFUL theming. Characters "act" as they would in the show. Locations and items feel like artifacts from Firefly. The creators obviously had a passion for authenticity and it shows.
- Mechanics: This game is essentially Diet Light D&D In Space. You perform skill rolls frequently that items, characters, and abilities can adjust. You get into conflicts with several ways out. This isn't a Munchkin-style "Kill anything you meet" game. You can use diplomacy, cleverness, or weaponry to get out of a jam.
- Bits: The parts in this game are wonderfully constructed. Ships are hefty plastic chunks and feel sturdy. The money (HOLY COW THE MONEY) feels and smells and looks AMAZING. The dice are great, and the board, cards, and box all have stellar art and graphic design. Imagine Bioshock's art mixed with a Western flair, and you're halfway there.

Cons:
- Length: This game takes time. HOURS. A 2 person game took us at least 2-3 hours. It's a "whole evening" game, not a fun -1hr game.
- Chance: This game has just a BIT too much reliance on chance and luck. Dice rolls and card pulls can be devastating, even if you've played well so far. I wish it was a bit more informed by player agency.
- Rules: It's not as complicated as other hefty games (Android, Twilight Imperium, etc), but it's still a doozy. Be prepared to spend a good amount of time in "tutorial mode" for new players.
- Boring? A bit. A large amount of the game will be spent carting people and cargo to and fro. The event cards, random encounters, and moving Alliance and Reaper vessels keep it tense, but still, at it's heart, it's a pick-up-and-carry game. After 4 hrs of play, it starts to show through.

I recommend this for any fans of the show, and anyone who gets tingles at the thought of owning a ship, modding it with equipment, enlisting and upgrading a crew of individuals who have unique strengths and weaknesses, and trying to hack it in the bleak dangerous black of space.

Excellent game.  Player interaction is quite limited (screw the other players), but still a very enjoyable game.  Minimum game length 2+ hours. Biggest problem I have with this game is the monster amount of table space it requires.  I invested in business card holders for this game to cut back on the table space requirement, but still a massive foot print on the table when playing this game.  Just so many cards and tokens.

This is a great sandbox game - it's let down a little by the lack of automation in the reavers etc; our groups are not the sort to like 'take-that' play so we never tend to send the reavers after each other, which is unthematic. Otherwise - brilliant.

Nails the Firefly flavor, but the game suffers from the snowball problem.  Once someone gets a lead, there's nothing you can do about it except play out the last ninety minutes until they officially win.

DRIPPING WITH THEME. The rules are organized horribly, but the rulebook itself is a joy to read, with all the Firefly quotes and fun vernacular/colloquialisms. The minis are nicely modeled, will paint.
Gameplay is pretty simple, but there is good variety in the Jobs, Nav, and Supply cards. Gameplay theme is spot on, which carries the somewhat less-than-innovative game mechanics.
Oh, and the paper money in this is the -only- good paper money I've found in a game. It is beautiful, quite thick, and (once again) SUPER-THEMEY.

RATING: 9
Merchants of Venus + Firefly universe = OH MY G-D THE THEME MAKES THIS AWESOME!

If you like Firefly, YOU MUST PLAY THIS!!!  If you don't like Firefly, you are dead to me.  (Just sayin'.)

Objectively, the game is very luck-driven -- card draws, dice rolls, luck is everywhere you look.  Your choices do influence your ability to respond to this luck so it's not entirely unmitigated.  And you have goals to accomplish with choices (sometimes) as to how you accomplish them (or at least how you get from point A to point B and how fast you get from A to B).  But objectively the game isn't fantastic or amazing or anything.  It's Merchants of Venus with some stuff.

BUT THE THEME!  OH THE THEME!  AND LO I SHALL CONTINUE TYPING IN CAPITAL LETTERS BECAUSE THE THEME IS THAT AWESOME.  IT IS!  IT'S IMPLEMENTED VERY WELL SUCH THAT THE GAME GIVES THE FEELING LIKE YOU'RE A CAPTAIN (MAL!) PILOTING YOUR SHIP IN THE FIREFLY UNIVERSE.  ("WOOT!  I FIND RIVER AND HIRE HER FOR MY SHIP!  MWUAHAHAHA!!!"  Oh Summer Glau, wherefor art thou?  *cough*  *cough*)

I WILL PROBABLY OWN THIS GAME.  BECAUSE I KEEP TYPING IN CAPITAL LETTERS.  BECAUSE I MUST.  BECAUSE I'D BE A BROWNCOAT IF I WENT IN FOR THAT COSPLAY OR RPG THING.

Definitely one for gamers who are fans of the television series. Very fiddly but only to capture everything that could have happened in the series. Liked the artwork especially the money.

This is a game I really, really, REALLY wanted to like. Really. But as thematic as it is (and it really oozes theme), it felt like I was just banging my head against some poor design choices. The push-your-luck element was presented far too early into the game, and made the game a painful, boring slog.

The solo mission isn't very engaging - time pressure doesn't allow you to explore the game. Running two ships and seeing what story develops might be somewhat entertaining, but won't happen as the game needs way too much table space. As such unplayable outside of America. To be sold. (It's not worth the hassle)

I can see how Firefly might offer a thematically pleasant experience when you don't make bone headed decisions *and* aren't screwed by random luck even after taking proper precautions. The game translates bumbling around space trying to make a buck and get some rep with a rag tag crew of misfits and mercenaries pretty well. The "feel" of the experience is pretty cool and there is some strategy, but I hesitate to call this a game with a lot of strategic depth. That holds it back a bit for me, but I like what it's doing overall.

As an avid devotee of Firefly, I was somewhat dubious when it came out in a board game. Often, these things are such a disappointment.
My initial foray into the game was with 5 players, and not enough time. The second game didn't fare much better either.
However, I persevered, acquired the game myself, and after some practice, realised that the only thing wrong with the game is the Playing Time printed on the side of the box.
It is not a short game to play.
It is however, an excellent game for Firefly fans.
The 'colour' in the game, and the game mechanics are very much in the style of the series.
Advice: do as they say and keep your eye on the Supply and Contact decks. I does speed things up.
THIS IS A GOOD GAME.

RATING: 6
I wasn't a fan of the tv series; its Wild West in space theming seemed both implausible and lazy (space, the wild frontier - geddit? Yes).  I'll have to take the word of other commenters that Firefly is true to its theme.  There is certainly a shed load of characters and stuff, and while it is possible to operate as a law abiding trader, there are abundant temptations to take up the outlaw life.

Firefly is frequently likened to Merchant of Venus and indeed both are games in which picking up and delivering is repeated for rather too long.  That and the game play is solitaire-ish; the other players are just downtime between your turns.  There is also a hatful of random elements from card draws for just about everything to dice rolls to overcome challenges.  The luck can be mitigated, but still it can screw you. A jolly wild frontier narrative gives Firefly some appeal, but ultimately it isn't quite enough.

Production quality is excellent, though the artwork is uninspired.

This game makes me feel like a space adventure cowboy with danger at every turn, in every sector, and every attempt at nearly anything (well, except paying your way through speech checks) could go wrong if you're not prepared. 

In broad strokes it is sort of an RPG / sci-fi / adventure game. There comes a point where your crew / gear will make any task ridiculously easy, for example Jayne with three weapons on a fight check, but the journey is half the fun. Well, most of it.

RATING: 8
Great themed game. If you're a Firefly fan - go for it! We played for 2 hours, as it says on the mission card, but I can see why people complain that it can be really long - you can be easily distructed by the theme from the mission itself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Firelfy is not only for the fans of the series, although having watched it recently made the experience far more enjoyable. The game is a typical buy-move-trade, but unlike its older peers, it plays nicely, there's tension and no random imbalance in the game.

Having different scenarios bring replay value and make every game (slightly) different. Something I will play again in the future, even though because the turns are strictly sequential and almost nothing happens simultaneously the game time is rather long.

Excellent game that is slightly hamstrung by a long setup time and quite long play time. It's ostensibly fairly simple: turns are quick; actions are fairly intuitive (with a free printable help sheet) and objectives are pretty obvious. The components are stunning. However, this one is going to take a long while to explain. Expect teaching to take at least twenty minutes.

At it's heart this is a pick up and deliver game. But it's a pick up and deliver game set in Joss Whedon's Firefly universe. And with each play you will feel like you're cruising through the 'Verse trying to make a living as well as stay alive and free. The only reason this one doesn't get a 10 is because of the length. Despite the box and adventure cards telling you it will play in 2 hours that will not happen. Set aside 3+ hours for this game.

I love the show and heard that theme carries this game, but man did I dislike this game. Basically pickup and deliver with a bunch of random events that you may or may not be prepared for. Going full burst was tedious to ha e to flip over a card for each tile and seemed to bog down the cards. Lastly, the strength of the various misbehaving cards vary significantly and add on die rolls makes it a game that is 100% not for me.

I played this at Gencon and then back at the hotel with a buddy and we enjoyed the game.  It is a great port of the TV show.  One concern I had was lack of player interaction though it is true to the Firefly universe.  However, I spoke with the designer and told me of an upcoming expansion will allow a much more, "take that" and aggressive interaction play style.  I am looking forward to this but enjoy the game as is as well.  GF9 has done with this license translation.

Questing In Space!

This game is cool, but it takes up a LOT of space (no pun intended). You'll need a big table for this one.

It's like Twilight Imperium Lite! Sorta. You don't build an armada, you just have your one ship that you fly between planets and space stations. When you fly to some space stations or planets, you can interact with "contacts" or "shops," which each have a deck of cards you draw from to get missions or items.

The overall goal is to hire crew members and make money, with different win conditions based on the scenario you choose.

This is a really fun game that I find very relaxing when playing solo. I don't consider myself a fan of the show, so I think this game is accessible to non-fans. It helps to know the setting though. It's a game about recruiting a near-random crew to accomplish goals both big and small.

Some words of advice...  if a game box tells you what to do in 3 simple statements.  Something like: Find a crew, Find a job, Keep flying... Then it makes a lot more sense to do what it says than trying to mix it up and do it in your own order.  Why?  Because if you ignore the straight up advice, your game is going to run a long, long time.  Far longer than even the series this game was based on was on the air.  Okay - so that aside.  

For fans of the series, this game is actually quite well done.  It really captures the feel and the look from the show.  The game play is solid, if a tad drawn out - which is not a problem for fans, but may not tickle the fancy of those with unenlightened souls.  Overall production is really great.  The box is filled with Firefly goodies.  Add in the expansions out in the 'verse and you have a game that will delight fans.  For non-fans, they are likely to find a good pick up and deliver game with a lot of chrome.  Sometimes chrome can make a game and this is one such title.  Just remember to do what the box says (and in the right order!)

Gale Force 9 has transformed the Firefly franchise into a very entertaining adventure game in which you're taking on Jobs and trying to finish various Goals for a Story card that will vary each session. The theme and characters are embedded everywhere but you won't feel like you have to run the exact course of the show. Mechanically it's all pretty basic stuff with die rolls, adding bonuses, and then paying off your crew for Jobs, but this isn't a game you really jump into for amazing design, but to get carried away and do a little Misbehavin'. Good on its own, but GREAT when you add in the expansions.

First game was 3.25 hours.  I can see it getting down to 2 hours with more play.  This game can be random, so it may not be fun for those who like minimal luck games.  

Being a fan of the TV series adds a lot of understanding to the game.  I can't see playing this regularly but fun every now and then.

An ok game, actually better than I expected but nothing remarkable. I commend the effort, and kudos on the very high quality game components. 

Personally I think without the Firefly hook I'd rate the game around a 3 but with how well the theme integrates into the game and how much I love the source material it does make it a lot more playable.

Bottom line is, though, it's a bit too random for my liking. 

Realistically I'm still hoping for a cooperative game where you get to play different members of the crew with different scenarios based off episodes.

For Firefly fans, I can see why they would love the game. It's very busy, and there is lots of theme piled on. For someone who couldn't get through the pilot, the game is just okay. I personally don't like "pick up & deliver" games. They start to feel like a chore, and not a game. To be fair, I should play more scenarios, but... I'm not sure that I will.

This is an interesting take on the Firefly license. It's not a game of thrilling heroics - it's a merchant ship simulator. You'll be doing very little wisecracking, and very much taking mail from the depot to the border planets.

The turn-to-turn gameplay is pretty fun and satisfying, and each individual piece is fine. The game is far too long for its experience, though - the 2-hour estimate is a joke, and you can expect to spend 4-5 hours on a game.

I'm considering, as a house rule, reducing the max crew to 4 but giving everyone +2 to all rolls. Get things rolling faster.

One other complaint is that the rules use Firefly quips as rules terms. It's fine once you get used to it, but makes learning the game that much harder. For example, 'Kosherized' (can't use icons on weapons). 'Aiming to Misbehave' (random challenge deck). 'Keep Flyin' (no random event)

So yeah, I won't be tearing my hair out if I end up playing this again, but I think it missed the mark on creating 'The Firefly Boardgame'.

Ok only one play so far.. but I really enjoy it.  Those that know me know that I don't mind a long game.. if you don't like long games, then this probably isn't for you (you're looking at close to 3 hours if you have 4 players.)

Admittedly, there is a bit of downtime due to the travel mechanics, but the theme definitely shines through.  Considering a few house rules to speed up play, something along the lines of only drawing an Alliance Space/Reaver Space card every two sectors during a full burn... or allowing 2 sectors at 'mosey' speed.

I was blown away by this game. Not just a cash-grab aimed at fans of the cult show. I enjoy the show, but this game is still tons of fun. I don't want to sound like the typical dissenter, but the game is a little too long. HOWEVER, I only felt this way in the last thirty minutes out of two hours, so take that with a grain of salt. Botching certain jobs can set you back substantially, but I still have fun racing to deliver goods and turning over the misbehave cards to see if I might have acquired that one special item that lets me proceed. Plenty going on, tense gameplay and plenty of strategy. The theme fits the mechanics, and despite the length, I was entertained.

Decided to rate finally after it has been requested by my family and has been burning a hole in my conscious to get back to the table. As a fan of the series and of good writing and acting in general, I feel connected to the story that was created while playing the game. Not as the characters I know, despite the cards I may select as captain, but as a member of that verse and in that period. Its an uncanny feeling that adds a lot to the play time. For me that is the strength of this one, my siblings not all of which have ever watched an episode, got that from it, and in the end its about sitting down and enjoying the experience, this games mechanics work in this presentation and the sum is way more than the parts together and comes out to something special on my table.

Have not rated this one yet as there are only solo plays of it, I have had an absolute blast with what is here, but still solo. Group play is coming soon and I will have a better idea then. For now this one is a solidly put together and produced game that produces a nice bit of tension on every move. Replicating nicely the sense of wonder, awe, and dread that those characters who inhabited this verse on the fiction would have had. It also brings a bit more and here is where it shines: it conveys a sense of familiarity, accomplishment and yes confidence also, you have to act the part if you want to be the part. While a lot of this is board gaming in general, that particular trait serves this ip very well. I am a fan of a lot on offer here: the franchise, roll play, die rolling, paper money, even the actors on the cards, so yes there was a lot for me to like anyway. However the uninitiated with the show should still enjoy this romp of a thematic game if they enjoy the mechanics involved and the unique brand of flavor this setting delivers. A very deliberated upon rating will come soon, but suffice to say I like this one a lot.

What to say about this great game.

CONS

-its long.First play 3 people 4 hours with rules.
-its big you need a big table for this.even bigger with expansions.It could be streamlined in size.I think the ship and board are too big they could be smaller.
-not a lot of interaction with other players.

PROS

-the feel when you look for jobs,items,upgrades,crew is just awesome.You definitely feel like a captain in this game.Hugeeee plus for that.
-its not that easy.The difficulty depends on the  scenario.Some of the scenarios are hard.To get the scnario done and have the most money is a challenge.Carefull planning your trips ang getting the right missions based on your stats,crew is the key factor to win.I think it has a good tactical aspect.
-awesome production value.You get a lot of stuff here.
-perfect thematic caption of firefly universe.A must buy for firefly fans.

GF9 knock it out park with this one again.Sons of anarchy probably soon.

I'm a heavy Euro gamer and know nothing of the Firefly universe; so take this comment with that in mind...

 Firefly is a chaotic and random dice fest that takes too long for what it is. It was repetitive, bland, dull and it does not bring anything innovative to the table. Perhaps if you are a fan of the series it could interest you.

Terrible, terrible game. A barely non-zero amount of player interaction and way too long. The only way to enjoy this is to put on your fanboy goggles and pretend you are in space (which can be done in a more fun and engaging way with a sci-fi tabletop RPG). There is no game that I want to play all the way through less than this one. I knocked up it up one point because it does look nice.

I can imagine that this game could have immens replayability as there is no reason why people cannot make their own goals. It could even become an epic game with serial playthroughs that culminate into a major objective, such as revitalizing the Browncoats or breaking up the Alliance. The game has its own suggested missions, but we can think outside of the (literal and figurative) box.

Firefly takes one part Merchant of Venus, one part Talisman, sprinkles in the cast and setting of Firefly...then bakes the whole thing at 350 degrees for 2 hours.  What comes out of the oven might be one of the most entertaining pick up and delivery style games ever made.  Calling it a Pick Up and delivery game is almost a disservice to the game in the box though.  It's more of a thrilling cosmic adventure game!  It's got so much going on, but it's very easy and smooth to play.  I love the mechanic of flipping cards over to move around...it creates this palpable sense of fear.  The nice part is it makes sense thematically from the show.  Also most cards give you a couple of options which is always cool too.  The game has dice, but they don't dominate the game.  Man, everything just feels right.  I happen to love the show and the game doesn't disappoint.  This is dream come true type of game...and Gale Force 9 delivered.

RATING: 9
This is one of the best board games I've played to date.  I went into it skeptical because I was worried that someone may have just picked up a popular license and threw together a half-assed game to make a few bucks off the fans.  That is most definitely not the case here.

Firefly captures the flavor of the TV series and movie pretty darn well.  For example the abilities (which each 'crew member' has variations of) possessed by River Tam are random each time you head into an 'event', but can be partially controlled if you also have her brother Simon Tam on your crew.  Still, even if it had nothing to do with Firefly the game play/mechanics could stand on their own.  (Just to note: Some people think the River/Simon combo is broken... I do not for a second. There are other crew I much prefer over them).

At first glance, and even during your first game, Firefly will likely intimidate even fairly hard core gamers.  It is a game that simply reading the rules is not going to do it for you... you must play this game 2-3 times before you really get a completely solid grasp on a personal strategy and it might take more if you don't really pay attention to everything you can do/get and where you can do/get it.  There are 13 decks of cards, half a dozen or more types of tokens, the ships, a good sized board, dice, and various other odds and ends used in this game.  The game has a LARGE footprint.  It will cover a 3.5ftx5ft table pretty well... and that's without the expanded board that "Blue Sun" adds on to it.  Your first game will be slow, it's going to take you 3-4 hours... but once you pick it up it starts moving along and 2 hours is a more reasonable estimate.

Last note, in my opinion you can choose to ignore the various scenarios the game comes with and simply set a time limit, adding up the valuables that all the various players have to determine the winner if you like.  This means if you want a quicker or longer game you are not tied to a specific goal the game has set for the players to win.

I love this game a stupid amount, even though it absolutely hates me. I'm the only person I know who can spend four turns trying to burn six sectors and still not managing to do it. There's just something that appeals to me about the game though...

I like always feeling like there's something I can do. I like wandering around collecting crew and trying to find work. I curse my luck a lot, but I like both the movie and the tv series this is based on, and there are so many references that in every game I find things that make me chuckle.

I played this game before watching the TV series and again after watching it.  The difference in enjoyment was dramatic.  While I thought it was 'ok' before watching the series, afterward I truly enjoyed the game.  This is essentially the TV show in a box.  If you like the Firefly series, you'll enjoy the game.  Do yourself a favor though and download the fan variant "10% of Nothin'"

RATING: 8
Gale Force Nine really does an incredible job of handling IP's. If you love theme baked into every fiber of the play experience, you owe yourself to check into games like Firefly, Spartacus, and Sons of Anarchy. I disagree with some others in that I absolutely feel that this board game captures the essence of the show. The decision points in "keeping flying" is balanced with regard to keeping a good and happy crew. There slower momemts of developing simple plans at a comfortable pace and there are tense moments when you have to push a situation farther than you like. The other players are your competitors - but with a civility among rogues. Really, the game is charming as was the show. I like the show; though it doesn't blow me away like other IP's do, it's charming and consistently likeable. That's also so how I feel about the game. It's a wonderful way to spend a gaming afternoon with friends when the week has already provided enough stress such that you don't want to have too much on your weekend, too. It won't change your world, but if you're in the mood for a narrative building game, Firefly offers a beautifully deep world into which you can immerse yourself. Yes, randomness plays a larger role than might be comfortable for some (card draws are important). Someone who presses their luck can win big over someone who performs who makes the smart decisions and comes up dry. If this could bother you, the game either isn't for you or it's not for the mood you're in. I'm not always in the mood for Firefly myself. When I am, though, it's a pleasant, rich place to be.

Very well themed game that captures the feel of having to haul passengers are cargo throughout the 'verse. Can be a bit harsh at time with encounters during travel, but certainly captures the bad luck that seemed to plague the crew from the TV series.

The game be a bit on the long side, but is a fun time, even so. The various expansions only add to the theme and increase the tension. The ship expansions, in particular, add variety to play style, and are highly recommended.

RATING: 10
Essentially "Merchants and Marauders" in space. You have a ship which is used to get and complete "jobs" (often pick-up and deliver) for which you get paid. You can visit various "contacts" to get the jobs and other locations where additional crew can be hired, your ship upgraded, or you can select gear with which to outfit your crew. Jobs can involve the delivery of cargo (possibly contraband), passengers (possibly fugitives), or could be an illegal act such as robbing a bank or any number of questionable activities. In the course of this some members of your crew can become "disgruntled," you can be attacked by Reavers, or boarded by Alliance forces searching "outlaw ships" such as those carrying illegal cargo, fugitives or "wanted" crew members. The base game includes a number of scenarios with varying objectives not all necessarily involving being the Richest Captain in the 'Verse. Player interaction is at best indirect as there are no player vs player elements, but there are situations where your actions can interfere with or complicate other players' progress. One of the expansions fixes this if you must have it (Pirates & Bounty Hunters) but I found the game challenging enough without also having to contend with your opponent's attacks.

Thematically, it is very true to the short-lived Joss Whedon TV series of the same name (and the movie: "Serenity"). It is a "space western" in much the same manner as "Merchants and Marauders" is a swashbuckler. In fact they play very much alike. There is a fair amount of die rolling in both games but each case you can help your cause by the careful accumulation of crew, ship upgrades and gear which yield die-roll mods and/or key items without which your job could be botched, or worse.

I like to think of it as a "beer & pretzels" experience not meant to be taken too seriously. The bits are well done, colourful and very thematic. The artwork and flavour text are evocative and tongue-in-cheek similar to the style of the series being an odd mixture of Buck Rogers and Tom Mix. The cards, and there are many of them, beg to be read aloud as they are being considered or resolved rather than simply, "oh, here's a gun skill check - I need a seven." Another way of saying that those who might get the most fun out of this game would be fans of the old TV series. I really like Merchants and Marauders as the best of the pirate-themed games; but, given the choice and for a similar experience (but now set in space), I would play this.

RATING: 9
Provisional rating, I might get bored with it ... but as a fan of the show this is about as good as it gets :)

I really like it isn't a co-op, I first thought you'd all be crew on the Serenity, you're not. Each player owns their own, go out into the black, look for jobs, misbehave, get paid.

Helps if you know the show/film and like it. But fans of pickup/deliver will find stuff here they'll enjoy too.

Downsides, maybe a bit too long for some and player interaction is a bit limited.

Overall, shiny :)

It's dripping with theme and if you're a fan of the show you might like this.  As a game, it underwhelms and takes way too long.  Take away the Firefly tie-in and this game is a 4.  If you do play never leave Alliance space without a pilot, fuel and a mechanic.  You've been warned...

I do like Firefly (identify a lot with Kaylee) so that is one aspect of it (this is a ship and deliver in the Firefly universe) and was said to offer nice gameplay and with the expansions it offers great replayability. Jude has created some extra material for this one that I´d love to try.

The amount of components made it feel a bit overwhelming but it was much easier to learn than I expected and fun.

The more I play this game and the more I re-watch Firefly, the more I love this game (and Firefly). 

I'm interested in the Blue Sun expansion, I don't think the base game will hold my attention forever. A dozen plays maybe, but not forever. 

Great game. Always been a hit with Firefly fans, the one person with whom I played who had not seen the show also enjoyed it.

A note about length. The complaint I've heard about this game is that it is too long. I disagree and here's why- whenever I teach to a new player, I say, "we're going to play for 1 hour and whoever had the most money at that time wins." Every time the hour comes and the person says, "Can we please keep playing?" I had to cut my little sister off after four hours on Thanksgiving. The game can be played very openly and that can lead to indefinite playing times- but that's because everyone is having fun literally "playing" in the Firefly universe. 

Great game, a no-brainer for any fan of the show.

Don't play the beginning scenario unless you are really just running through to learn the rules. It is not fun, ends quickly, and depends entirely on the luck of the draw. 

However, playing any other scenario is great. The theme is extremely well done so plays well to fans of the show. The only criticism I have is that it is based on scenarios so I suspect replayability is ultimately limited if they do not continue to issue expansions to increase scenarios.

I loved this game so much–at first. Two hours in, I couldn't wait for it to end. 

The first part of the game is spent getting crew, installing cool upgrades, and fulfilling missions, traveling across the galaxy. Woohoo! The second half of the game was spent rolling dice. And rolling dice. And rolling and rolling and rolling. And often failing. Three turns I spent in a single spot. Half of my turns were lost by bad rolls or bad draws while flying.

"Lose a turn" is my least favorite mechanic in any game. That alone dropped my rating from an "8." We may try a variant to allow repeating failed actions (e.g. move-move if your first action was stopped by the Reavers/Alliance; work-work if your first action was a failed skill check, etc.); hopefully this might speed the game up and cut down on the number of lost turns.

UPDATE: We like this more with the pure money scenarios. The game moves faster and there aren't nearly as many dice checks. It still can be frustrating with bad draws/rolls/lost turns, but at least it feels thematic.

This game really captures the feel of the series for me.  The gameplay allows it to be accessible to gamers who have little to no exposure to Firefly otherwise.  Would like to get this on the table more often, but the longish play times for my group make this a challenge.  Of course, since it has solo rules I can always play a game if I have a few hours to myself while letting the show play in the background.

With Blue Sun and Kalidasa Expansions

The obvious comparison in my collection is to Xia (which I rated at an 8). In many ways, it is less luck dependent than Xia, which I like a lot better. At the end of the day Xia provides more choices of what kind of captain you're going to be, which is why it rates higher. But Firefly has a lot going for it (not the least of which is the theme, which is infinitely attractive to me). I enjoy it, and it's quite fun solo as well, which is not something I find in a lot of games. Recommended, if you're on the fence about it.

The theme is very strong. I'm pretty sure this game would be unappealing to anyone unfamiliar with the show. Once you get past how deeply the theme goes, the game itself is fairly flawed. The difficulty of the "misbehave" cards seems to range from "piece of cake" to "only possible if you have a particular card," and since these come up randomly, this mechanic feels broken. Some have serious consequences for not meeting the objective, while others have no consequences at all. It seems like the winner is the person who gets screwed over by the game the least, but all the screwage is determined by random chance. If I wanted to be randomly screwed by a game, I'd play Candyland and get it over with much more quickly.

This game is tough to evaluate. I want to like it more because it looks so cool. The game is definitely longer than advertised and lots of table space is going to be needed. There is a mix of luck and strategy in the game that takes experience to understand how to balance it. There are lots of cards to go through in game play, so knowing what to expect or look for will definitely help. The theme is great and I do enjoy the game because of the decisions to make. My favorite part is buying crew and equipment. Lots of cool combinations can be achieved with all the cards and scenario's. My biggest gripe with the game is the length of play, it's just too long, so it makes it very difficult to get to the table. I do think this game is great, when I get the opportunity to play it. It's a keeper for me and I hope to log many more plays.

The game based on the short-lived yet awesome TV series of the same name.  The game manages to capture the feel of the 'verse and the trials and tribulations of the crew of the Serenity reasonably well.  However, game play always seems to take WAY longer than advertised, to the point where it's easy to get bored of getting jobs, flying around, and finally decide to pack up and play something different.

Ahhh this game... Some Firefly soundtrack in the back... Find a crew, get a job, keep flying ^_^
You can't take the sky from me!
The theme and flair of the series is transportet so beautifully that I have no trouble following other player's gameturns even if I have no interaction. Its fun to live through all these stories of  guns and moral (or not harharhar!)
You decide through your actions if you want to be a bastard or an honorable vigilante, a grifter or a smuggler or a bunch of companions.

My friend's father once played with us. He didnt know the series bacj then. He knew it was SF so he was all in and curious. We beefed the Misbehave Cards up with some storytelling and he was 100% emersed.
A week later or so he was done watching the series ^_^
So you need time, a bunch of Firefly-, SF- or outlaw- lovers and youre ready to go.  
The only reason for me that this is not a ten is the high ammount of luck needed at times. Sometimes you'll just have to live with it, if your end of the story turns out badly.

This is definitely a game aimed at fans of the series. The many references make more sense and enhance the game more after you have viewed the show. That said, it's a pretty good experience game.

The setup scenarios keeps things fresh with varying win objectives and minor tweaks to the basic game.

If you are a fan of the show then you'll probably be all over this game. Unfortunately I found it extremely bland and dull. Even with just three of us playing the game too far too long and I just got bored. 

The biggest issue other than game length was the random cards which seemed to be either keep flying or be screwed over. No middle ground.

RATING: 2
What saves this from being a 1 is that the components are wonderful and even having not seen the show it has very strong theme.

however the game is a slog, little player interaction, considerable downtime and is hilariously swingy. i don't mind a reasonable luck factor in games (i enjoy merchant of venus for instance) but there's far too much random in this game that can wipe out your last 45 minutes of game play.

the amount of cross you fingers, roll a die in this game would work in a 30 or 45 minute game. with the game length you're likely to see with firefly it feels very out of place.

super overrated. nice theme. nice components. game play is a snore. very little player to player interaction and too long of waiting between turns - making it a long game for what you're actually doing (suffers from Arkham Horror disease).

the players moving the Reaver mechanic backfires because it pays for most players to just move it away from everyone for mutual benefit in "non-aggressive" groups. 

love the TV series but this is just like multi-player solitaire and it's a shame they make you buy an expansion just to get some actual player interaction going.

Solid game.
Captures the feel of the 'verse and is a lot of fun.
Could use a little more direct player interaction, but that's just nitpicking here.

There are some downtime issues but these should become less of a problem with repeated play.

The game is thematic and feels like an adventure game but as I'm not familiar with TV-series, that aspect didn't catch me. Compared to Merchant of Venus, which lacks the feel of adventure game I still like Merchant of Venus bit more than Firefly. Firefly is simply too long and luck-dependant for what it is. I guess that there is still an opportunity open to create a better space trading game that uses best elements of both games.

RATING: 5
Too long and too much downtime to justify keeping it around. Plus I think you really need everyone playing to be a fan of the series otherwise a lot of the theme is just lust on people and it becomes a pretty standard pick-up and deliver game without it.

Still great game for what it is but Merchants of Venus is my go to game of this type.

I really want to like this game, but it's just so... much.  There's too many pieces, too many rules, and takes too long to play.  Once the game gets going, it's pretty fun.  However, it seems to be just as fun as a solo experience as with others.  The game has a lot of potential, but it needs to be reworked a bit to fully realize its potential.

Thematically speaking this game draws me in and really transports me into the setting.  No, it's not firefly the series, but it most definitely is firefly the 'verse.

Keep flyin'!

In this game you take on the role of a captain flying around the 'verse trying to complete the main mission objective before the other players. 

You need to upgrade your ship, hire crew, get weapons and money, all the while avoiding the authorities and the reavers. You become 'solid' with the shadowy figures of the 'verse to earn more cash and then use this to get the necessary skills/weapons/upgrades to complete the main mission. 

Highly thematic, and will be most appreciated by Firefly fans. The components are also excellent. The game plays up to four players, however I think it could be prone to some significant downtime with more players. 

Overall a very shiny game.

This game is extremely faithful to the concept show and a whole lot of fun.  As I think others have said, yes, it's a pick-up and deliver, but that's the whole idea of the program, so it's a perfect fit.  It plays a little bit long, but for a real fan of the show, you'll enjoy being in the Verse for that long... (also, there's a great "starter" scenario that can be downloaded from the official site that can play in under 2 hours -- obviously longer if it's your first game).  Randomness can be mitigated by making sure you build up your bonuses... That roll that might have seemed like a coin flip before is because you didn't make sure your crew had enough weapons, etc. Your decision... Piloting a Firefly is sometimes chancy!

Thematic pick-up-and-deliver game. It feels like a combination of Merchant of Venus and Talisman/Relic due to the random card draw and dice explosions/checks. The game goes rather long like them as well.

After the high standards set by Spartacus, I was disappointed by this game. It feels a bit like four players playing the series on their own, with way too little interaction between players.

RATING: 7
A few plays in, impressions are good. It's fundamentally a pick up and deliver game, but the different types of missions from the different characters (Badger, Niska, etc), along with the different scenarios, make it interesting.

In some ways this game reminds me of [i]Merchant & Marauders[/i], except that the crew members are more specialized and you need to tailor your crew for the types of missions you plan to take. The morale/disgruntled aspect is a nice touch, too.

You can't attack other players, though you can mess with them indirectly using the Alliance or Reaver ships on occasion. That's one advantage [i]Merchants & Marauders[/i] has over this game, though in practice actual attacks on other players in M&M don't happen so much as the [i]threat[/i] of attacks on other players, so maybe it's not such a big deal.

The game has taken some heat for both playing time and luck. I think the playing time issue is solvable with experience and by simply capping the number of players at three. Four is a bit much. Also, a simple house rule allowing both moseying and regular jumps on the same turn could help. As for luck, well, there are plenty of things you can do to mitigate it. The people whining about it probably skimped on the equipment and/or crew members that could have helped them, and got burned as a result. And keep in mind that the worm usually turns for everyone at some point, so don't panic because of one bad die roll because your opponents will probably get some bad luck of their own at some point.

Criticism regarding the rulebook, however, is warranted. It's definitely a bit on the weak side, as born out by a rather large number of rules questions here and the lengthy FAQ. Be sure to get the FAQ and go over that. The lack of a player aid also annoys me, though there's a decent one in the files section.

Still, thumbs up overall.

A rich treatment of the Firefly universe, a sci-fi western from Joss Whedon that didn't make it through the 2002 Fox TV season. You're a wheeler-dealer in a Firefly-class freighter who hires a crew then accomplishes a series of missions given you by a collection of shady characters, all while avoiding the Alliance patrols (the cops) and the crazy Reavers. Very immersive - the best TV-show-based game.

Definitely thematic, but like a lot of "theme first" games, it's a bit on the fiddly side.

Despite these weaknesses, it's fun. But if could be a lot better.

I should probably lower my rating a point or two, because I have only played the internet scenario, which is apparently extremely short compared to the ones that come with the game.  But rating scenarios I haven't played is just as dubious.  The (shortened) game is fine, and I felt like it did a decent job of conveying the theme.  I'm not much for experience games, usually, as the high degrees of luck aren't for me.  But here it was pretty easy to shut off the part of your brain that wants a good gaming experience and just go with it.  I wouldn't go far out of my way to play again, but if someone put it in front of me I'd probably be fine with it.

Got to finish a full game on my second try. The game says 2 hours, but we went double that.  Of course, I am still learning, but good grief!  I see where the complaints of "it's just a pick-up and deliver game" come from, but I do love the theme.  Watching the show on Hulu while playing the game really helps you get in the mood.

After 2 plays, I began to realize that this is all theme but no real meat.  Strip the theme away, and it could be any other pick-up-and-deliver game.  Disappointing.

It's a lot like Merchants of Venus but I think Firefly barely nudges it out due to theme.  There's a ton of luck in this game so know it going in.  Some can be mitigated through good play, but card draws are key.  Also there is a ton of stuff in this game...super fiddly.  Do not play this game with anyone who must analyze every possible move before making a decision.  Literally there are at least 30 cards out at any given time.  You have to be at specific places in the space map to pick them up.  But imagine a new player who would not make their decision on where to travel until they understood every possible card and implication.  Insane.

I suppose the least kind review I could give of this game is that it is pickup and deliver with a bunch of random crap in between.  Because I tend to feel the mechanisms of a game more than the theme, I am left wanting...wanting to go play Merchants Of Venus.  

However, as a fan of the show, I can say this is a nice implementation of the Firefly license.  The components are great, and the game design is passable.  The biggest draw to this game is that it lets you revel in the 'Verse.  

That being said, even if you can swallow the mechanistic underpinnings of the game, there's an awful lot of luck here for such a long game.  I think they key point of tension is trying to take the minimal amount of crew and equipment along on your missions to maximize profits, but if you slice that too thin you will be frustrated by the die rolling. On the other hand, if everyone just gears up all the way, the encounters rapidly get too easy.

On the whole, I don't think many would have given this game a second look if it weren't for the Firefly name on the box!

Good  fun game. CAn drag out a little, but is one of those games where the fun is getting in the spirit of the game, not how you do.

Update: its 18 months on & I have added all the expansions up to and including Blue Sun. Pirates and BOunty Hunters broke several aspects of play balance, so we heavily filtered the cards from that and there really is almost no reason to attack another player. Once we did that, we found the game got even better. Blue Sun really boosts the Reaver activity and kicks the game up a notch.

WOrth noting that Blue SUN had "fixes" for a lot of cards and rules we had issues with.

Perhaps not the best "game" of this genre, what with Merchants of Venus is still around...At least so I hear. Myself I've owned MoV for years and years, never played. Firefly is appealing, Firefly looks good, Firefly does what it does well. So perhaps MoV is better, but I'll likely never know because as a package, as a whole, Firefly will see tabletime where MoV has a track record of not. And what I feel the game is, isn't a pick up and deliver, it is an adventure game. You have a ship, you source crew, you tailor what you do to your liking be it illicit activities or purely by the book. You just have to "work" to pay for these toys you tool around with.

I wanted this to be so much better than it is, not horrible just kind of meh.  Beautiful production though, the money is beautiful, the ships are solid, and the cards do a good job of integrating movie shots into the graphic layout.  Probably only keeping it because I love the show so much.

RATING: N/A
Everyone who loves the show will love this game and should stop reading.
It is space smuggling game like Merchant of Venus but placed in Firefly universe. You pick your leader and your Firefly type ship and start recruiting new crew members, buying equipment and making business contracts with less shady and shady characters (like Mr. Niska). You can do legal job which pay miserably or illegal if not immoral jobs that pay quite well but you must be careful not to be caught by alliance patrol. Whatever you do you must also avoid contact with evil Reavers when you are outside of the Alliance sector. There are multiple scenarios and all the time players are immersed into the space western theme.
The only drawbacks is big turn downtime and complete lack of player interaction. The only conflict between players is when deciding who will take captain Mal and the rest of the original crew. This, they say, will be solved by the expansion.

[b]Update:[/b] Huge, bloated, tedious setup and unbearable downtime made me change my mind about acquiring this game.

This game is like multiplayer solitaire.. it has very little player interaction.  In most of the games I've played.. there has been no interaction among the players at all.  In spite of this, the game is a lot of fun.  It's like each player is individually racing towards the same objectives to win the game.  The game is more than a pickup and drop off... you hire a crew and have to have balanced skills within the crew to successfully pass the different objectives by rolling dice.  It's pretty fun.

Hey, everybody needs a pick up and deliver game in their collection.  I love Firefly so this was a natural fit.  This would be higher but the game requires too hefty of a time commitment to rate higher.

Similar to, but (after 1 play) better than Xia for me. Couple reasons why:

- There was much less down time between turns
- I prefer how Firefly randomizes movement... really dislike roll and move in Xia, prefer the cards in Firefly... at least you get some flavor text and options
- I'm not a huge Firefly fan, but do plan on watching the series at some point, will likely improve my experience here.

I still have to play this more, but I did the solo adventure and feels very thematic for a Firefly fan like me. It is very laid back, with not much interaction in the base game, and the game feels a little like doing the same thing over and over, but I am plannning to get everything that comes out for this game. I just love Firefly. 

UPDATE: 

Got rid of Firefly in the end. Found no one to play it with and it's just not a very good solo experience :(

After one play with four people I'm not sure what to think. On the one hand, flying around and recruiting crew, buying equipment, and completing jobs was fun, but on the other hand after four hours of game play only two of us were able to complete the first of three goals needed to win. There is no game mechanic (like a set number of rounds) to drive the game to an ending, and it took a long time to get what we needed to have a good shot at completing the three goals needed to win, so in theory the players could fly around for hours on end simply completing missions and not doing much of anything else. With a different group of people, I'm sure the game would go faster, and again, it was a lot of fun despite the length, and the game is dripping with flavor text and nuggets of Firefly goodness, but I'd have to play a few more times before I can decide what to think...

RATING: 7.5
It's a bit of a luck fest. But it's fun and sticks nicely to the theme. 

I played the (available online) shorter mission (get 2 solid contacts and then $6000) - as the others had tried the 'recommended' adventure (apparently less 2 hours and more 3-6 hours!)

In the two games, (2 player) the first I drew a hard mission, bought crew to do it well, got an unlucky 'making trouble' card and lost the mission, got a warrant and nothing to show for it. I barely did anything before the other captain won.

The second game, he had a worse time of it, and while I didn't have the best rolls myself, I had easier missions to complete. Managing to end while he was on about $3k.

But had fun! :)

Played again - a lot more of a luckfest. I thought in a longer game it would equal out, maybe it did a bit. But I kept rolling 1's and another guy straight 6's meaning complete fails for my (near) certain success, and success respectively when it was one out of six chance! (if he had to roll at all)

I've never seen Firefly, ever, at all.
I played this game once with 3 friends (just the base game, no expansions). This took 3 hours. I found the game rather "meh".  I felt like I was playing "Monopoly in Space".  
By this I do not mean the mechanics (obviously).  Instead, I mean the slow, plodding pace; the very significant lack of player interaction (although there is a modicum of that); and, most of all,  how very little control the players  have over what happens to them.
I am really stunned this game is rated above 7.  I think this shows a "fanboy effect" -- people who love the Firefly universe enjoy spending time there, even though the game itself is only OK.
In this sense it reminds me very much of Hogwarts Battle, because I consider that a just-OK game that I wouldn't play if I didn't love the theme.

Maligned... why? Yeah, the game isn't that deep or strategic, but as a representation of its theme it's near perfect. The game revolves more around tactics and a little bit of good fortune, but given the nature of the show this works perfectly for the theme.

RATING: 8
Firefly is a very fun theme game, that I think much like the Battlestar Galactica board game, has a few adjustments(expansions) that will be needed to make perfect. The biggest flaw in the game is that the Alliance and the Reapers do not pose as large a threat as they should. Meant to cause havoc and chaos in the middle of your thrillin' heroics, they fall short of this, by simply being too easy to evade and avoid. The easiest fix for this in my games, has been to triple their movement when their most common move card comes up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
For any person who watched and enjoyed the series Firefly, this game is thematically perfect:  "Things don't go smooth."  A classic pick-up and deliver game in a hazardous universe of boom and bust.  All that is missing are a few embellishments due out in the expansions.  Persons who don't like Firefly, or can't handling losing, shouldn't play.

RATING: 7
[3 plays] For the sake of sloth, I'm pasting something I already wrote when asked to compare Firefly to Merchant of Venus: 

Both these points of comparison [that both are pickup-and-deliver games with a space exploration theme] are somewhat true and somewhat not true. The theme of MoV is definitely space commerce (with a side of exploration). The theme of Firefly, though, is Firefly. MoV is straightforward commerce--buy low, sell high, and make profitable investments. In Firefly you're more like a crook pulling capers, though some jobs may be legit. And Firefly is very much a game whose mechanics were developed to fit an existing theme, not vice versa. 

Likewise, MoV is definitely classic pickup-and-deliver, while Firefly is only sort of P&D. Some of the "jobs" you and your crew can accept in Firefly involve taking stuff from A to B, but others just involve going to one place and doing something. And the things you have to do for the endgame goals (though they vary) don't tend to be P&D. Also, skill checks are a big element, which is totally absent from MoV. 

The pacing of the games seems significantly different--though I'm definitely speaking from semi-ignorance. At this point I have played MoV 50 times and Firefly 3 times. In MoV, you're looking to get off the starting block fast, start making money right away, and make every turn count. If you get too distracted by rambling around looking for exciting space relics, you might have fun adventures, but you're not so likely to win the game. And although there is some degree of equipping your ship in MoV, that's not nearly as big a deal. In Firefly, you need crew and equipment to be successful. 

I think there's a tension between spending time to build up a better crew which will make you more successful at the goals, vs. progressing more quickly toward the goals but with a lesser crew and lesser chance of success. In the few games I've played, I definitely have tended to get too good a crew and be beaten by people who moved faster, which is probably partly because of getting drawn into/distracted by the theme, and partly my tendency to be conservative and wait to strike until the odds are in my favor. 

It may well be that MoV seems tighter and faster to me because I've played and analyzed that game a lot more; if we play a bunch more Firefly, a similar dynamic may emerge there. That actually seems likely, because the game is similarly race-y. In the early learning phase we might be just wandering around in our spaceships going "Hey, isn't this cool!", but when we know the game better it's likely to become painfully clear what the average game length is, what the value of a turn is, what things are worth taking the time to invest in, and so forth, and Firefly will seem less like a rambling, picaresque space adventure, and start to feel as tightly strung as MoV does now.

This is largely getting a six from me due to all the Firefly/Serenity details the designers brought to the game.  However, it's simply dull.  There is very little, if any, player interaction.  There is no way to effectively rein in a runaway leader and taking the lead can often come down to lucky job (card) draws.  Sorry, I appreciate the effort (and love GF9's mats), but unless its expansion radically improves it, I wouldn't want to play it again...which is a shame.

Pick-up-and-deliver game with plenty of random effects which can be mitigated by stocking up on crew and equipment, but a player who takes risks and gets lucky will trounce everyone who plays it safe (on the other hand, a few bad risks will effectively eliminate a player). Very little player interaction beyond the race to victory conditions (money/missions).

I love Firefly the TV show! The game has beautiful production, but it's pretty long and there's almost no player interaction. Turns move quick, but you don't do any spectacular things. It feels a bit repetitive after a while and it's also a bit random. It's the Firefly universe, no doubt, but the game only captures the feel of the show in a very broad sense. The game is not about what the show is about, the people. It's simply a pick-up and deliver game. It's not terribly bad, but the length and the randomness just kills it for me.

One of my favorite games.  Firefly is much more than it looks at first glance.  There is a sandbox element to it that a lot of people overlook.  You do not need to be a fan of the show to enjoy the game (although it will help you get the references and jokes hidden throughout).  The biggest downside is the amount of space needed to play the game.  With its expansions it really requires a huge table.  The game itself takes a bit to get the hang of and can drag on rather long sometimes, but that can also be a good thing if you are ok with playing a long game.  Overall it is a glorified pickup and deliver game with a lot of other options on the side.

It's really hard to imagine a game truer to its theme than this. Yes, it's a pick up and deliver game, just like the show. But it is so theme-rich that the mechanics are barely visible. After playing you really feel as if you lived an episode. Fantastic game.

There are some nice thematic elements that evoke elements of the show such as misbehaving and how frightening the Reavers are but overall it's a design out of the 1980s with all the randomness. There are dice rolls and card pulls galore here as if it were inspired by Talisman and published in 1988. And just like Talisman, it's not that there aren't better decisions than others, it's just that luck can overcome your good decisions and reward someone else's longshots. One bad turn can wipe out several turns worth of work and set you back an hour.

You take a group of people and 1 or 2 will get wiped out by bad luck, 1 will do extremely well and make it look easy, and the rest will be in between. So you go along for the ride to see which one the dice and card gods have allocated you to be this day.

Favorite Pick up and Deliver. Well, only one. But if you're going to buy one, this isn't bad. The game modes need more thought, though, the jobs can seem mechanical and very similar after awhile, though expansions help.

Note: This game requires a large table to play, lots of decks and a large board. It gets even worst if playing with more than 2 players and / or big box expansions.

Interesting game with plenty of flavour but very simple game play mechanics. I have only played the once but I can already see that each game will feel very very samey. plus there seems to be no way to slow down a run away leader.

As a firefly fan boy I like all the flavour of the game such as Niska being a B@stard to work for and woe betide you should you fail his missions and displease him, however neither the alliance criuser nor the reaver cutter are scary enough.

This was a lot of fun to play.  Although it took 3 hours for 3 players to get through the intro scenario.

I had watched and read a few reviews which caused me to go in with some hesitation.  The luck and downtime were stressed, but other than one situation, none of that appeared for us.

Everyone kind of planned their turn out while the previous players were going so there wasn't a lot of waiting around, especially when someones second action was to buy and you could start your turn.

As for luck, we only had one situation when someone ran afoul of the Cruiser and rolled 3 1's which caused 3 of their employees to be caught.  Other than that, one the first couple of Misbehavin cards got turned over it became clear to everyone that you really needed a decent enough skill level to have some confidence that you would pass.

Overall, a pleasant game.  Not quite as thematic as say, Merchants and Marauders, which adds a lot of flavor text, but still great.

I would definitely play again.

The theme shines clearly through in this game.  It reminded, from a mechanism point of view, a lot of Merchants of Venus.  Which is fine since I really that game too.  The game is easy to understand and play.  It does feel as if it moves kind of slow.  Still, this is a fun game to play.  I'd like to get a few runs under my belt.

I've decided to ditch the well designed insert.  Once I decided to add in my own plastic dinosaur for first player marker ("Wash" had one on the ship dash), there was no more room in the box.

GREAT GAME!!! I love the series and the movie and really like the world that Firefly takes place in. Its a shame they never expanded on it. This game stays true to the TV show. If you know the show you will recogize all the missions and smile. The game mechanics are solid, slighty clunky but not painful. There is always something you can be doing when its not your turn. Id say the only draw back to this game is its playing time weighing in at an average 4 hours. This time drops a little as player learn the mechanics so replay improves. I personally love long games but it wont be the first game i bust out at a big gaming party. Id say thats it for the more social personal game nights with you best gamer buddies. I highly recommend this game.

We played with all of us agreeing what to do on a single ship using the solo rules.  Played like this, it was great fun.  We got the horses, and they were our friends.

It seems like Firefly would not be very fun competitively.  There aren't many actual decision to make and you're largely at the mercy of the space decks.  It's OK when winning is determined by luck when your entire group is on the same team and is screaming about how NO WE CAN'T GIVE UP THE HORSES NOT EVER THEY ARE MY FRIENDS.  But playing an hour or two long game that you basically have no control over? No thanks!

Great theme. Highly driven by luck. I do like the feeling of moosing about in space trying to earn money and avoid dying.

Fun game. Bump in rating if you like the series because it is one of the best tv/movie tie-in games I've played. Very thematic. Flipping cards every time you move can be a pain. Downtime can be a factor with more players. I think 2 or 3 players is the sweet spot, maybe 4 if all players are familiar with the rules and cards. Also, you need a big table due to all decks of cards.

This game seems to deliver on what I was expecting - adventuring, little player interaction but some conflict vs the board possible, a ton of cards (I played with some expansions).  Sprawling might be a good word.  Some Firefly flavour in there although as it was my first game I didn't take as much time to enjoy the images and text as I might have liked.

RATING: 10
Licensed products can be pretty dreadful, re-skinning a very ordinary game mechanic with some pretty pictures from a TV show. But this game is put together from scratch, and obviously by people who love Firefly. The game mechanics conjure the events of the show and it feels pretty much like a RPG, where every player is a rival captain recruiting a crew, finding work, doing the job and getting paid. There is so much randomness and player-choice available that no two games should ever be alike.

The materials are created with care and attention, and are based not just on the TV show, but also some of the visual "extended 'verse" of fan created and licensed product. The dice (two, even though only one is required) have a little Firefly image for a six. There are four actual firefly models as player counters, and a Reaver Trans-U and a lovely Alliance Cruiser (this last is a bit wobbly on its stand).

If you are Browncoat, this is must buy.

There seem to be some problems with distribution and not many stores in the UK can get hold of it. So it's great that AmazonUK has copies for sale (10 left at time of writing).

RATING: 8
The main problem with this game is that it's too long. A secondary problem is the amount of screwage that can result from other players' deliberate actions. The combination means that it's unlikely to be my first choice for play, but might still suggest it if only for the theme, which I love.

Edit: Re-adjusted my score upward as I realized this actually has become my first choice at times. The problem with length has been mitigated by refusing to play with more than 3 or 4 people, and 4 only if everyone already is familiar with the game.

Player screwage is only a problem in that we have some players who take that kind of thing very badly, so it's almost never used. I'd actually like to play in a game where the NPC ships were used more aggressively.

Can be a lot of fun if you're playing with Firefly fans. Takes a long time, and there are lots of decks, requires a large amount of table space. Still, feels great when you hire Inara or Jayne or when you sell some contraband to Niska. I had River in my crew and she got nabbed by the Alliance, and... it felt like I was living in the 'Verse, yes it did. Games can drag, though.

Played once with 5 players (3 of them new to the game), and it was too too much. Downtime was unbearable, and we had to play on the floor due to the space it took up. I would recommend at most 3 people per game. 4 could be doable if everyone was experienced and understood how to speed up the game. 5... not sure if I would try that again.

Thematic and lite pick-up-and-deliver game with resource management.  Components are of good quality and graphic design is superb.  Some player planning involved but your chance of winning is much more based on how lucky you are (or rather how unlucky your opponent is).  Lots of jokes from the TV show peppered throughout, so fans will appreciate this game most.

A very good game that could have been great. This game works well with my family. They love the shopping aspect. They love that the game isn't about combat. In some respects, the game is similar to Merchant & Marauders. But in my opinion, Firefly is superior. You get to put together your crew, whereas in M&M your crew doesn't really have a face. Plus the missions are more interesting here. However, I'm not a big fan of the Misbehave deck. You should be able to plan for a job and put together a crew and supplies that meet the needs of a job, but you do that only in a general sense here. Success at the job comes down to the Misbehave card that you draw--at that is largely luck of the draw. You prepare for success at Misbehaving in the same way regardless of the job. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Early impressions very positive.  The game is a little like Merchant of Venus if you only left in the satisfy demands part of that game and spiced it up a little with  other chrome, so I'm going to make that comparison repeatedly.  

At first, I thought Firefly had fired MoV.  After a number of plays, I don't think that's true.  Firefly is not even as close to as good a competitive economic game as Merchants of Venus.  It's just that it tells a better story.  The choice between both games is really about whether you lean toward narrative in your pick up and deliver or a leaner, more cutthroat economic game.  If I'm honest, MoV is probably the better designed game.  The decision to keep all cards that have been drawn face up for anyone to examine is fucking GRIM.  If you want to play at all efficiently you have to get down to the business of at least vaguely knowing what it is in those discards, which is brutal for game pace.  Bad design there.

You don't need to be a Firefly fan to enjoy the game, though it does help.  Also, dear god, don't play with more than 3 players, downtime city.

This is a space adventure game that scratches the itch perfectly. It helps greatly to be a fan of Firefly. This game seems like a true labor of love for the Firefly franchise. If you aren't a fan, is this still a fun game? I think so, but with some caveats. The setting of Firefly is the Wild West in Space. If you want a variety of aliens and ship combat, look elsewhere. This is a game about basically trying to make a living and avoiding the law and Reavers.

If you love the Firefly series and like games with LOTS of random events and don't care if you will have 1 1/2 minutes of down time (i.e. time where you do absolutely nothing in the game) per turn per other player in the game (i.e. in a four player game you will do nothing for approximately 4.5 minutes before it is your turn again) then FF might be a game for you.

For me the game absolutely BLEW CHUNKS.  I liked the few episodes of the series I watched so I thought I would give it a try.  The sheer randomness of all aspects of the game from drawing cards for jobs you could do, to drawning cards to see which goods/crew you might be able to by (in the firefly universe they have no websites or ebay to know what is available anywhere so you pick from random stuff when you need to shop for upgrades or crew)to every space on the board you may have no encounter or may get stopped and lose your goods after moving one "space".  When you arrive at your destination you may have to "cause trouble" but of course the trouble you have to cause is totally unknown to you until you draw a card to tell you the terms of your trouble. If you FAIL you not only don't complete your job but you lose the job and may lose 1 or all your crew in addition (crew which may have taken you multiple turns to assemble and with an average of 5 minutes downtime per turn in a 4 player game means that your last 30+ minutes of work can be vaporized with one bad draw/roll combination).  Once you are behind with a bad FAIL you will likely never even come close to catching up.

I would rather be punched in the arm than play this random pile of puss again.

Big fan of the show (although not quite as fanatical as some), I was excited to receive this game as a gift. Having done a lot of reading up and rules-prep, I was expecting to love this game more for the theme than for gameplay. While that is true, I was pleasantly surprised by how well this game played in our first go. We played the new "Captain's Chair" scenario (which Erik won by a landslide) but had a lot of fun building up a crew, buying gear and planning jobs/routes (and accidentally selling contraband I needed for a job. Note: don't do that again). Looking forward to a lot more plays...

When i saw the word Firefly, followed by "the game", the jaw dropped, the wallet opened, and amazon was sending a copy my way.

Having loved the series, and Serenity the movie i could not wait to play this one..

To sum it up:

Thematically: yes, its firefly, the characters, the random, the art, the minitures, the reavers... Absolutely superb. Fan boys/girls will love the art, images and stories.


Gameplay: scenarios without house rules and modifications are way too long, no pvp, and the mechanic is very very samey. As a game it lacks real decisions and the tense moments. The excessive random element becomes very annoying.

Overall a must for firefly fans, but hardcore gamers without a brown coat will walk away disapointed.

RATING: 4
The theme is implemented very well and is quite immersive, regardless of the "Serenity" crew being scattered around. You buy crew and equipment, get jobs from contacts and try to fulfill them. All fine and I really like the idea of story cards, which give you various goals to achieve, instead of the all-too-common "player with most money wins".

Unfortunately, the game suffers from a terribly long playing time and huge randomness - never a good combination. I don't mind a little randomness, but the problem here is that bad luck is often extremely punishing. A bad card draw or die roll may set you back several turns. When you fly, for example, you can as easily have no events or be stopped in the middle of the movement and lose your cargo, passengers or crew members.

The worst, however, is the "aim to misbehave" deck, which gives you completely random challenges without any way to predict what you will encounter. When you have to "misbehave", you basically flip cards and hope for the best. One card even requires you to have a specific character, which is simply bad design.

Another instance of bad design is that you can have three active jobs, but you cannot voluntarily discard them. If you lose whatever a job requires you to transport, you need extreme luck to replace it, and you are likely stuck with an unavailable job slot for the rest of the game. If you are unlucky, you may even have all three slots blocked and be out of the game.

Despite the problems, it was fun for a few plays (my enjoyment of the TV series surely helped), but I think I'm now done with the game.

Basado en la serie. En el juego, los jugadores reclutan tripulantes, cumplen misiones y combaten (un poco) entre si. el primer capitan en cumplir determinados objetivos, gana. 

No recuerdo mucho de el (lo jugue en 2014, antes de que se publicara en españa). me parecio un juego competente pero no especialmente destacable en ningun apartado.

RATING: 10
This game is everything that I've wanted in an adventure board game, and more.  It's deliciously thematic, with a wonderful crew and equipment system.  Everything in this game is very personal and gritty.  You're not simply picking up a "job" from an anonymous person -- you're doing a job for a specific contact of yours, and if you complete it you will gain a specific advantage with them;  if you fail, you could stand to lose not only the money, but even your reputation with them and others.  Wonderfully flexible system that is elegant and deep without feeling complex.  

There is luck in this game, but it can always be mitigated by crew and equipment.  "Luck favors the prepared" as Edna says, and that is certainly true in this game.  At first glance, the event cards seem brutal in their luck, but the crew and equipment cards are so powerful that they more than counteract. A wise captain is able to shrewdly build a ship to mitigate the luck that comes his way. In my first playthrough of this game, my endgame ship was so powerful that it was like a well-built level 3 ship in Galaxy Trucker -- event cards kept coming my way, but I had a +9 bonus in combat, a +7 bonus in influence, and a +5 bonus in repair. I hardly had to roll for any encounters, because my ship and crew was so overpowered to be able to deal with that. Granted, it took a LONG time in order to build that ship and crew up, and I had to take a lot of risks and cut a lot of corners to make it to that stage, but finding a twisted path to navigate the complex 'verse of Firefly to get to that point is the fun of the game.  As a big Galaxy Trucker fan, I really felt like there is a shared spirit of luck dependency and luck mitigation in both games, and while you can build a nigh-indestructible ship in both games, there is the time pressure from your opponents that makes it infeasible to reach that optimized level of perfection. In Galaxy Trucker it's a real-time pressure as the sand timer ticks down, and in Firefly it's a turn-based time pressure as your opponents are trying to gear up to get strong enough to take on the end-goals sooner than you do.

There is a huge effect that crew and equipment have in mitigating the cascades of adverse luck that are due to come your way in Firefly: The Game. You'll all draw crappy cards -- what matters is how well you've prepared, and how creatively you recover.

In addition, I love how jobs in this game are divided along two axes -- morality and legality.  Jobs can be legal but still be immoral, and can be illegal but yet be moral, and the way that it all flows together so smoothly really communicates the gritty nature of the universe.  Fantastic space adventure game.  If you're looking for a game that is an excellent economic game of cargo and delivery and route-building, then play Merchant of Venus.  If you're looking for a game that immerses you into a universe full of adventure and despair, hope and greed, corruption and redemption, and lets you fly around in a battered ship and try to make your way in this place for a couple of hours, then play Firefly: The Game.

RATING: 8
I was extremely impressed by the thematic integration in this game. It really has the feel of an adventure game, with random events occurring that seek to tell a story more than to offer a mechanical advantage. And yet the primary mechanisms revolve around pick-up-and-deliver. These two aspects blend together nicely to really give the same feel as the TV show on which the game is based.

Players will cruise their Firefly-class ships around the 'verse, avoiding Reavers and the Alliance while trying to complete jobs for (often less than reputable) contacts. Certain jobs will have more negative consequences if you run afoul of the law. You will also gain crew and weapons, most of whom are expendable, but some of whom are appropriately powerful and could cause real heartbreak when lost in battle (most of these you will instantly recognize from the show). 

Like most games based on a property, familiarity with the source material is a definite plus in terms of your likely enjoyment. It's not an absolute necessity, and it may even create some interest for players who don't know the show. Still, the narrative the game creates is far more compelling when you are already invested in the characters before the first card is dealt.

Pretty streamlined and fun version of classic ameritrash-style pick up and deliver.  Yet, the downtime is still ridiculous.  It's a genre thing, I get that.  I enjoyed it well enough.  Completing quests, er jobs, was satisfying enough to play once or twice anyway.

RATING: 5
Good ameritrash, pick-up-and-delivery game with awesome production value. A must buy if you're a firefly fan-boy.

But for me it's too soloish. You fly around & have very little interaction with other players.

Much better developed than Xia.

RATING: 7
Only played a pretty short first game: I won surprisingly with 3 goals completed before any of the other players had one.

It's thematic, has very beautiful components. If you are into the movie/series it will probably work for you. There's not much strategy though. I liked it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Firefly makes a great attempt at capturing the thematic flavour of the Joss Whedon stories, in the 'Verse.

What it doesn't do is streamline the play; I find that it plays as slowly as AH, which means it had better offer a lot for the time gathered.

And for total die-hard Browncoats (this may be you folks), it does a fair job of that, but if you tire of the play trying to drag yourself back up for another attempt at misbehaving or a goal, only to fail, then I'd say steer clear, except for those occasions where do you want to be with total die-hard Browncoats.

There is a lot of card-drawing activity, every turn you Fly, and that takes up time.  There is a lot of die mod calculation every time you have to misbehave, unless you have the Ace to bypass the card.  And there can be a lot of back and forth trying to realistically get money to do things you need to do to win- and it may still be for naught on a bum die roll.

If anything, Firefly is a little too realistic- players who have ill-fortune with cards or dice may see themselves passed, through no particular strategic fault.

This is thematic gaming, folks, love it or leave it.

Starting this at a 6.75, though I'd like to make it higher for some terrific efforts at realism, I can't because it just plays a little too slow for me.

Too bad- this is a fine game in many ways.

Over the last month & a half, this game has dominated our table. Each week we added more expansions and my wife considers this her all-time favorite game (that's alot coming from a person not too inclined to games). This has put Merchant's and Marauders into 2nd place for her. I love Firefly, so this is a "must have" for any Firefly fan.

They did a nice job with the flavor. But by the end, I was so bored that I was actively trying to help other people win. And I couldn't! It's so luck-based that even with player collusion, one bad roll can postpone victory for another hour.

Understand why people would not like the game. I don't know if I would say it's a "great" game, but it's a lot of fun and that's what I want in a gaming experience.

Concerns about how long the game takes I don't really understand. It's designed to allow people to finish their turns (shopping or dealing with contacts) while others are starting theirs. If you do this and go through the flight decks without scrutinizing each card for a minute, you can easily get done with the game in the recommended 2-3 hours.

[b]tl;dr[/b] — Don't know from the show, but as a storytelling/adventure game this works great.

This is a "story game" first and foremost—it provides, via cards and mechanics, a series of dots that you and your friends can connect to spin an engaging yarn of your time out in the black.  In that regard it has far more in common with [thing=21523]Runebound[/thing] (and the like*) than [thing=131646]Merchant of Venus[/thing].  As it stands, this is a pretty middle of the road pick-up-and-deliver game—but it is an [i]awesome[/i] story game.

I suppose I should admit that I am not a [i]Firefly[/i] fan—I never got past the first couple episodes of the TV series (especially when they were pandering so obviously to segments of fandom that I am not a member of**), though I did enjoy [i]Serenity[/i].  This is important to know as my flaccid interest in the license in no way detracts from this fine game.

As a licensed product this one transcends—to an amazing degree—the usually poor treatment such things get.  The bits are all gorgeous and high-quality, especially the money (and I loves me some paper money***).  The game is mechanically sound, works, and provides an interesting storytelling engine.  Instead of phoning it in the designers and producers definitely heaped some love and skill on this.

Speaking prematurely and from the hip I get the impression that the sweet spot for this will be 3p—I fear that with 4 there will be just too much "story" flying around as well as too much downtime waiting to get back to yours.  But we shall see...

This game is amazing and a ton of fun.  Very high quality product with solid rules and variable gameplay for replay value.  It is filled with references from both the TV show and the movie and helps captivate the flavor of both without interupting gameplay.

My only complaint about this game is it can be long winded with new players running between 3-4 hours.  After the learning stage the game moves faster, but you have to keep your players on task. 

I feel 2-4 players is the best way to play.  Any more starts to feel cumbersome, but that might be exacerbated by new player syndrome.

Good, fun game.  Not exceedingly competative because there is not a lot of interaction between players in the core game.  All players have the same goal which is established or chosen at the beginning of the game but from there, each firefly captain is on their own to assemble/hire a crew, find jobs, and buy weapons and upgrades necessary to accomplish that goal.  I think this one will be liked by the wife who is not a fan of heavily competitive, back-stabby games.  PS,  all the artwork is great regarding money, cards, game board, etc.  The components are nice, but nothing to scream about.  Overall, the game does give an atmosphere of the show and the threat of encountering reavers and Alliance ships provide tension and a risk of losing everything!  It is fun to have the opportunity to hire a character from the show as part of your crew.  Obviously they are the best of their types (engineer, pilot, etc).  You do not need to be a fan of the show to enjoy this game but it helps set the atmosphere.

RATING: 7
after only one play through, I think it's a fun game. However it lacks player interaction, can be somewhat samey with little strategy. 

I also found the first game unbalanced as one person drew 2 mission cards at the start of the game that were practically for the same pick-up and deliver locations. They were both also very easy to get to, unlike others who had to fly all the way across the universe only for a negligibly slightly better reward. 

Runaway victory, hopefully not the case in all games!

RATING: 5
This game drips theme so it's probably worth adding a couple of points to the rating if you're  a big fan of the TV show. 

As someone who is ambivalent about the theme, however, I found this to be a rather repetitive game with too much emphasis on pick up and deliver missions.

It's not terrible by any means - probably quite fun with the right crowd in fact - but a little bit too humdrum (especially played solo) to warrant a permanent spot on my game shelves.

RATING: 6
It's a pick-up-and-deliver game with a ton of chaos and a strong storytelling component.  Chaos certainly fits in well with the theme, but I usually prefer to have a little more control in a game like this.  In particular, the "misbehave" deck is fairly random and can be quite frustrating, because it is difficult if not impossible to move on until you complete a mission, and yet a failed attempt makes it more difficult to complete next time.  Still, there are interesting ideas in the game and I like the way it enacts the theme. One would expect this to be targeted at casual gamers who like the show, but it's probably too complicated for that crowd. 

We played with the scenario where players can declare the end as soon as they've reached a certain amount of money.

Not familiar with the show, but I see there was much attention applied to grafting the license to the game.

I know this show, and subsequently this game, has its fans.

The components, art, and graphic design are great.

However, the game is too long for the game play it provides. 90 minutes would be ideal, 2+ hours? - it is too random and repetitive.

I'm fine with randomness for a narrative driven game (ha ha, look what happened to me), but the narrative doesn't come through with this game. 

My biggest complaint - I feel the movement mechanic kills it - too clunky, draw a card for each space? -  more importantly, a few bad movements (bad events) can wreck you early. This would be forgivable for a game that lasted 1 and 1/2 hours, but 3+ hours, no.

Still, I see the appeal of this game. However, if not for its theme, it would be a complete stinker. There are some neat mechanics - perhaps it could be fixed, but dang it, ugh.

Even the suggested first scenario will take you much longer than printed the first several times you play, and expect that to remain the same with each new scenario.

Firefly encapsulates everything I love about games. It's basically an "open world" experience. The options available allow for many paths to victory, and the AI system is well designed to hamper your progress. The multi-layered mechanics compliment each other to offer an very immersive experience. The only game I have ever played the solo variant.

For me, there is nothing else like this out there and for that reason it's one of my top 3 games. Played on many occasions, it never gets old!

This is a fun game where I think that the theme has been properly represented in the mechanics. There are many wonderful things like if you choose to behave or not, or the point that you have to pay your crew every time you complete a mission, the different types of contracts... everything works very well. On the dark side, in my opinion, there is excessive luck involved in the game. Not only dice, but the type of cards that you draw at every location the probability of having a better or worse characters to include in your crew. For me, that is what really changes the game and creates the differences, not how do you play the game.
Taking that into account, the best way to approach this game is just to enjoy the mechanics, try to have a good time while traveling over the space and compete for the best possible result, but do not waste to much time planning great strategies because everything will depend on your crew.
Positive:
1. Very thematic
2. Fun to play
3. Good artwork
4. Several things to do
Negative:
1. Excessive luck involved

RATING: 6.2
It was a little confusing on my first go around but in retrospect that may have simply been because I didn't fully understand the rules and the there a lot of cards on the table.  On my second try after a thorough reading of the rules and FAQ I see it's a pretty straightforward and fun game. As long as you prepare a bit before running headlong into new jobs, plus some good die rolls, you'll be fine.

On my second game I probably played it too cautiously because when I finally started to actually work the goals I did all three right in a row without any problems. Doh!  

I played while  rewatching episode 1 which makes the game so much more enjoyable (if not a bit longer).  It's fun to directly correlate the show to the game.

Aside from the theme the game is pure Ameritrash, which I'm fine with but there aren't many real decisions and you will rely heavily on good dice rolls and card draws, especially early in the game.  Picking jobs and deciding who to hire and what equipment to buy is important but I often found myself just buying the best item I could while trying to shore up my weaknesses where I could.

So I enjoyed the game a lot but I'm also a fan of the show.  I'm not sure how this will stand up with someone to whom the theme means nothing. If you're all about strategy and decisions then maybe this isn't the game for you.  For fans of the show though, this is a must buy game.

Overall, very happy with this one! (Happy enough, I grabbed three expansions right away!)

RATING: 7
I'll be in my bunk.

This game is way more fun than I expected for a game based on a TV show. It's really fun. Actually, I think it's the most fun non-party-game in my collection.

For the first 4 or 5 games, there's no way the first recommended scenario would take the suggested amount of time of 2 hours. Double it, perhaps. But now after 8 games it really does take about 2 hours, occasionally a bit less. We also use a few house rules to make things a little less annoying.

One problem: The rule book is organized well but suffers from grammatical errors that obfuscate the rules. For example, the writers use the phrase "the dice" to refer both to multiple dice and to a single die. One of the rules said to "roll the dice", so that's precisely what we did since the game provides two of them. But we later figured out that you are in fact supposed to *roll a die*. It's a minor gripe that doesn't detract from the fun of the game, but it did make the learning curve steeper than it should have been, and it is an error that should not be there.

Still, just playing this game is worth the time you put into it. Did I mention that it's fun?

Needs a big damn table.

[Edit: After a dozen plays I'm getting a little tired of it. Even at two hours it goes on about twice as long as I feel that it should. I'm occasionally unwilling to play it, but it's still very enjoyable.]

RATING: 4
I really, really want to like this, and I really don't.  It feels like this game is so close to being awesome, even if you don't consider the appeal of the theme.  There are some really cool game mechanisms.  But if you get unlucky, you can get really hosed by missing a close die roll.  And there are a lot of rolls, so you will eventually do that, even if you don't exhibit the extremely bad luck I had in my first two games.  Plus, there ends up being huge luck elements with the cards, which don't seem to be particularly balanced.  Even all of that might not have turned me off of the game if it was a short game.  But the games I've played have been a solid four hours, and this with the recommended starting goals that are supposed to last two hours (one recommended by the rules and the other by the people in the Firefly forums here).  On top of all that, the rulebook is a disaster, with lots of holes and ambiguities.  Update: After my third play, I made the following comment about game length somewhere on the Geek:  The beginning and end can be fun, if only there wasn't so much middle.

When I was reading the rules, I thought the game would be great. Sadly it disappointed me because the downtime is excessive (the worst sin a game can commit).

I never watched the TV show, but I did saw the movie. Still I played the game with some friends who did see the show and it seems they enjoyed it a lot more than me due to this. 

At first everything was fine, the gameplay is very similar to Arkham Horror (move to a location, draw a card from that location, resolve situation with skill rolls, apply consequences/rewards, rinse and repeat) but after a few turns the game became boring for me thanks to the long downtime and the repetitive nature of the turns. I do like AH, perhaps because it is a CoOp game. 

A big part of the problem is the movement mechanic. On paper or seems fine, but drawing a card for each space is clunky and takes a lot of time. 

Player interaction is very low. Great art and components.

Firefly also has lots and lots of uncontrollable luck, practically guaranteeing a long game. The rule book had some holes in it but the FAQ answer them. 

Bottom line, it is a long game, with high downtime, high luck factor and low on decisions. It is gorgeous though but for now I'm selling my copy of the game along with the (unplayed) pirates expansion. I see only theme here, no game.

What a great adventure game!  We had never heard of the shows until I saw a group playing this at our FLGS.  They kindly gave a brief explanation of the show and the game.  It is not our usual type of game, but we started watching the Firefly show and I made my husband watch a BGG video of the game, and we bought the it.  Last night was our first play. Including running through the  whole rule book, it was a 4 1/2 hour experience.  Talk about FUN!  We love this, although I don't think Gary likes me anymore.  He was so far ahead, I just had to force some Alliance contact on him!  I won, and Gary may hate me a little.

Own Breaking Atmo expansion, Artful Dodger, and the Big Damn Heroes promo pack with the Bonnet and Dinosaurs cards.   We are avoiding Pirates expansion due to the high level of confrontation.  Now for a bigger table!  Just got the Ship Dice.

I rate this an 8 after one play.  Not sure how it will change.

I like the theme, the game is a little too "pickup and deliver" for me. It's really easy to supe up your ship early if you know what piles to look for people in, and then stomp on everyone. The game is way too slow for what it is, usually taking 2 hours to play through when we play on other's turns once the person won't affect what you do.

It reminds me too much of Talisman.

The first couple of times I played Firefly (a friend's copy), I hated it! Too much luck, I thought. But then I realised it's about risk management.

Love Firefly theme so I bought it. But it rarely got played, the movement mechanics are super clunky, and it is really just a pure pick up and deliver game which got old. I ended up selling it to a friend. I'd still enjoy playing it, just wasn't worth taking up space in my collection for as little as it got played.

RATING: 7
This is a fun pick-up-and-deliver game. At first, I thought it would be very similar to Merchants and Marauders, and it definitely shares some of the feel of that, but it definitely brings its own mechanisms and flavor to the table. If you like the show, you might like this game even if you're "meh" on pick-up-and-deliver. If you like the show and pick-up-and-deliver? I think it's definitely for you. (If you don't like pick up and deliver, I would probably pass.)

Is is perfect?  No.  Is is still Shiny?  Yes,... yes it is.

There is so much theme crammed into this little box that I'm genuinely surprised it hasn't exploded into a cloud of Firefly-themed rainbows and kittens.

Still, the two big negatives you may have heard about it are nevertheless true: 

1.  the game can certainly go on for too long, if you go by the rules as they are provided. I, however, aim to misbehave.  It is very easy to shorten the game length simply by marking how many of the victory conditions you'd like to play through on a given victory condition card, e.g., just set the goal for 2 of the 3 conditions, or even just one for a quick romp.  It's essentially modular in this way and suffers nor ill effects.  Thus, in my opinion, this is a small (and immediately correctable) gripe, unless you just HAVE TO play by the rules, in which case, I'm willing to bet my ship that this game was never for you anyways.  Yes, pulling a card from the appropriate deck for every move you make is slightly clunky and possibly tedious for some, but I like it better than, say, rolling a die, since it allows for more detail and modular upgrading from future expansions.  

2.  There isn't much in the way of player interaction-- especially in 2 or 3 player games.  Sure, you can mess with other players every now and then by having the right card show up at the right time, but that won't happen too often.  Also, you can actually snatch crew from another player when in the same space and under the right conditions (which likely won't occur all too often). Other than that, though, this just isn't that type of game.  It's more of a race, really, with some varying obstacles thrown into player's paths via dice rolls, vying for the same limited resources, and dealing with other player decisions throughout the course of the game.  
So, as long as you're expectations are in line with this type of a game, there's no problem.  If you were expecting BSG, or Twilight Imperium, then you'll be disappointed.

With all that said, is it fun?  

The short answer is: undoubtedly so.  

As a fan, I can't tell you how excited I was when I happened upon the chance to hire Zoë into my crew (while playing as Mal aboard Serenity).  What more can you ask for?  Those are the moments that make the game shine... and there are plenty to be had.  

Being boarded by Reavers sucks... like it should.  Having to stop for the Alliance to seize your stolen goods and fugitives sucks...as it should.  Flying around willy nilly in the verse while building up your crew, gear, doing odd jobs, and upgrading your ship is everything it should be... and it should be awesome, just like the TV show.  

At the end of the day, this game is made for people who enjoy Firefly and the Firefly universe... and with this intent in mind, Firefly the Game is a categorical success.  Go buy it.

Really great components and tons of flavor from the show.  Fans of Firefly will really appreciate how much it feels like being a part of the 'Verse.  Had a blast on the first play-through, but it is a complex game that times a bit to learn.
(After further review) - After another play-through and better grasp of the rules, there is a ton of errata/rules clarifications that need to be made, plus I get the feeling that there is far lass strategy and far too much luck.  A couple unlucky rounds can ruin you pretty early and climbing out makes for a long game.  I still love the theme and flavor, but the mechanics I feel are lacking.

My first Gale Force Nine game and the only one so far I'm interested in. Firefly is a thematic pickup-and-delivery game. It's about "skilling up" your crew and ship in order to pass three types of tests to accomplish jobs and earn money. Unless players are skilled up, the random factor can be brutal. Expect that one or two players get hurt so bad that they just can trail the pack. Once up to speed though the challenges become a breeze. Until then, a whole game night will be spend.

I enjoyed my one game (with the pirate expansion) but for the duration there's not enough diversity to play repeatedly. As it is, I rather dig out my old copy of Merchant of Venus.

Similar to Merchants and Marauders, only with a different theme and more fiddly parts.

Some of the parts are nice in theory, but not as well in practice. The biggest problem with this game is the length. The estimated 2 hours is very much on the low side, and in some cases, could probably be doubled.

I don't really know much about the Firefly setting, but the game seemed pretty competent, but I'd rather play Merchants and Marauders.

If you're a Firefly fan, the rating will probably be higher. Its definitely not as long or as one-sided as I was led to believe by the reviews. This game is very similar to Merchants of Venus. Plenty of pick-up and deliver.

The only change I would make is to allow players to "mosey" if their movement was ended prematurely. This would definitely speed the game up considerably. We found lots of wasted actions because of the times the ship was stuck in space.

Solitaire possible.

The rulebook is rather ambiguous.  It's necessary to refer to the official FAQ (v4.1) which clears up most of the rules.

Rating is higher with some of the expansions included.

I also have the Breakin' Atmo, Pirates and Bounty Hunters, Jetwash, Esmerelda, Kalidasa, and Blue Sun expansions, plus promo cards and the Artful Dodger ship.

There are many user-made variants and scenarios for this game, many of which improve the gameplay and also keep it interesting.


[b]I have written a more complex solitaire story card and also Jude's Solo House Rules which can be used with any solitaire game of Firefly to make the official solitaire game more difficult to win, add more thematic flavor and adventure, and perhaps add some length to the game:

I love Firefly. The boardgame is not a revelation but has a lot of heart and eye for the details if you loved the show. I exclusively play this with friends, who are all browncoats. The smacktalk and overall thematic fun we have with every acquired card (crew, gear, whatever) is always a great source of fun and creates its own stories including reminiscing about the episodes.

I really love this game, even though its a simple pick up and delivery game with some push your luck elements thrown in.

I recommend playing with the draft options at the beginning. This speeds the game up significantly.

 This game oozes theme. If you are a fan of the TV show you will undoubtedly enjoy all the references on the various cards. This can actually be a downside as all the reminiscing can delay the game. This will subside after a few plays and you've had a chance to see most of the cards.

 That all being said about the theme, this is a pickup and deliver game through and through. Get a Contract here, go over there and pickup goods, then go over to that other place to deliver said goods. Use the money to buy Gear and hire Crew to make your picking up and delivering easier.

 So pickup and deliver is the base mechanic, but it is not the end, only the means. The game is about the Story that is selected at the beginning of the game. This gives the players specific Goals that need to be accomplished, usually in order, to win the game. It may be as simple as get the most Cashy Money. Or it may be something a bit more involved than can be contained in this here comment.

 And I think it's this Story driven game play that, while being one of the best parts of the game, creates the biggest problem with the game play. In essence it's a race,  but you never really know how close anyone is to the end. Without this I think the game loses its sense of urgency. Fewer risks are taken and this has a tendency to prolong the game unreasonably. The excitement gets stretched out and by the end it starts to feel mundane, less aggressive even.

 Now is this a problem with the game, or with the people playing it? Well the people of course. But people invariably screw things up and it should the responsibility of the game to make people... better.

 In the end, Firefly: The Game is an amazing game that just has a tendency to last longer than it should. It needs less Pax and more misbehavin.

I am a proud Browncoat but I admit it's hard to defend how much I like this game because it has a number of flaws.

People say it plays long, takes too much table space, there's slow downtime in a 4 player game, not enough player interaction... all the criticisms are true, but I still love this game.

There is probably no game other then Battlestar Galactica that packs this much theme into a box.  This game feels so much like Firefly it's impossible to do justice in this little comment.  It's also a fun pick-up and deliver game in it's own right.  Does it do anything original?, maybe not, but what it does, it does very well.

I suggest getting a few Browncoats together, throwing on a Firefly DVD, opening a bottle of wine and enjoying this game.

Wonderful game that does a very good job of integrating the Verse! It's kind of amazing how much dialogue and nuance the designers were able to incorporate into the game. With how short the TV series was, it makes you wonder how more expansions will be structured, as most, if not all, of the characters from the show have already been included. Each expansion does varying degrees of good in adding elements to the game. The only complaint I've heard is that the game can feel like it's a solitaire game at heart, making multi-player feel a touch disconnected. Pirates and Bounty Hunters helps to alleviate this a little, but it is a valid point.

Highly enjoyable game with a lot of love poured into the components and the gameplay. Unfortunately, there are just a couple elements that knock the experience down a few pegs. Firstly, the card-drawing mechanic for basic movement is very clunky, and this can not only make each turn feel like a grind, but makes down-time unbearable for other players. In my personal games, this has been solved using a die roll for movement and a smaller (incident-laden) movement deck for any events that occur.

Finally, the overall objectives tend to feel a little anti-climactic; as soon as you've established a decent crew, you will navigate and annihilate everything with ease, without any real risks, so the game simply becomes a race. The expansion may help with this a lot.

I really like the way this game captures the theme of the show and is fun to play too.  The missions are pretty standard pick up and delivery or roll above a number to complete a task, but the characters give the game flavor.  The two non-player ships, the Alliance Cruiser and The Reavers, provide some needed interaction to prevent the game from being a straight-up race.  I just wish it was a little shorter.

I desperately wanted to love the game (because I love Firefly). The components are top notch. The theme ties in extremely well with the series. Game play is a bit boring, though. I decided to not get rid of the game (for those two reasons), but we won't play it again until we come up with (or find) some better rules.

Consiste básicamente en hacer encargos, recogiendo algo o alguien de un sitio y llevarlo a otro. De este modo consigues dinero, te ganas el favor de gente importante y vas completando los objetivos del juego.

Me ha parecido demasiado simple, en el mal sentido, porque la simplicidad en un juego la suelo valorar positivamente, pero en este caso para algo tan simple como es llevar cosas de un lugar a otro, se han liado a meter cartas y más cartas al juego, y luego más y más fichas, que acaban llenando la mesa más grande y no por ello mejorando la experiencia.

As of now, I do not enjoy this game very much because there is little player interaction. Additionally, one player was always in the lead due to a specific combo (I won't spoil the combo here). The overpowered combo and low levels of player interaction dissapointed me.

Seems like the scenario chosen can drastically change the length/type of game Firefly can be. It seems like it can be hard to collect all the required ship/skill upgrades to achieve the goal. It would be really helpful to know all the cards and where you can find them before even starting.

RATING: 7.5
I'm a huuuuuuuge fan of the show... HUGE.  That being said, the game is a 6.5 on mechanics and I gave it a 1 boost for the theme.

Why 6.5 for the mechanics?  Well, it's kind of boring.  If you remove the nostalgia of being in the Firefly verse, it's just a pick up and deliver game.  There's no real challenge other than rolling dice and hoping you make a roll.  Here's the game in a nutshell without theme.

Pick through a random selection of Jobs.  These Jobs are pick up and deliver from one space on the board to the other.  Then you can either move one space for free (mozy) or you can pay a fuel for up to 5 spaces.  Every space you move like this you draw a card depending on the area you're in.  If you're in Alliance territory, you draw from the Alliance deck and if you're on the Edge, you draw from the Edge deck.  The decks are essentially the same.  There's mostly "nothing happens" cards, then some move a NPC ship around card, and a few "stop here and get some extra cash if you want cards".  They're usually a bore and a hassle to go through.

Then you get to your space a turn or two later.  You deliver stuff as long as you have the required icons to finish the job and you get money.

That's generally it.  You can buy crew and equipment which is mostly just having fun with the theme.  I played against 3 players and by ignoring all the cool theme stuff and concentrating on the actual mechanics, I had more jobs done in the end than anyone.  Clearly I had some aptitude... :)

Again the theme is great, hence the 1 point bump, but the game as far as mechanics goes is boring; not sloppy or ill-conceived, just not a challenge at all. I love Firefly, I love pick up and deliver space games, but honestly, I don't think I'll be buying this one.  I just don't think it'll get played enough.

Fun pick up and deliver game, that is light on player interaction, but has a good representation of the theme. 

(My copy has some duct tape on the inside of the box lid to hold it together. I got it on clearance at Barnes and Nobles, and didn't notice the box had a split corner, and a detaching section when I bought it.)

3 players, wouldn't play with any more than 3. Nice theme I could relate to. Can be quite solitary as players don't normally get in each others way apart from inviting the Alliance to inspect them. Negatives are game time is long and winner is determined by luck, not skill (may not say that if I won ;-) )  but was still great fun to play.

Captures the theme pretty well with its mechanics and is pretty good. Quite luck dependent.

Its biggest problem in my opinion is the there is basically no interaction between players, this is just a race solitaire.

There are supposedly some sort of a Bounty Hunter expansions that might fix this problem.

Ok, I played this twice now: Once solo, once with five players, all veteran boardgamers.
The five player game was not a good idea. It just took way to long and became very repetitive. We'll probably never do that again.
The solo game was a lot of fun though. A bit on the easy side perhaps, but fast and very thematic.

A Great game that is based on a fantasy tv show. What I like the most about this game is no 2 games ever play the same way.

In Firefly: The Game – based on the popular Firefly television series created by Joss Whedon – players captain their own Firefly-class transport ship, traveling the 'Verse with a handpicked crew of fighters, mechanics and other travelers. As a captain desperate for work, players are compelled to take on any job — so long as it pays. Double-dealing employers, heavy-handed Alliance patrols, and marauding Reavers are all in a day's work for a ship's captain at the edge of the 'Verse. Firefly: The Game is a high-end thematic tabletop boardgame from Gale Force Nine (GF9) and the first in a series of tabletop hobby board games and miniatures games from GF9 set in the Firefly Universe.

RATING: 7
It's a little bit of RoboRally meets Merchants of Venus but a lot of Firefly theme with a couple of intersting mechanisms thrown in.  I think this is comparable to pick-up/delivery and customize spaceship aspect from Merchants of Venus but different enough that I probably like this game more.  It has a set of sequenced missions to achieve (for victory), similar to RoboRally.

Basically, the first half of the game everyone is building up their crew and ship upgrades, making money by various objectives, and acquiring a full set of reputations, in order to pursue the game's selected goals.  The last third of the game is spent gaining the actual goals and they cascade fairly quickly, and must be done in sequence.

It probably plays optimal with 3 players and that keeps downtime to a minimum and the pace of the game clocks in at a reasonable amount of time, for the type of game that it is.  For me, it's enjoyable with 3, and probably a bit too lengthy with 4.  The Firefly theme suits the game very, very well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not sure what to think.  Feels somewhat like a more thematic Merchants of Venus with a bit more chaos/randomness/nastiness.  However, in our group one person seems to always win so he must be doing something right to reward good decisions. Takes a ton of table space, particularly as you add expansions.

RATING: 7
This is a very tough game to rate because it is a kind of interesting level up/pick up and deliver/press your luck kind of game on its own but it is just improved so much if you enjoy the license.  I am a Browncoat so I enjoy the immersive theme.  If I did not, I would probably play something else given the length and relative randomness of this game (it is not a completely random game by any means and experienced players will have a huge edge but the best plans can be undone by randomness and the game is best played for the experience in my opinion). This game does what I want it to do very well -- it creates a rich immersive game with a very limited amount of source material.  It is also a solid gamer's game but it would not be an exceptional one if not for the theme. The length is a bit of a problem with more than 2 or 3 players for me because the decisions are not sufficiently engaging for the amount of downtime.  Scenarios played: First Time in the Captain's Chair, King of All Londinium, Respectable Persons of Business

Before, due to an unusually bizarre combo of cards, the game ended before we had a chance to really see what it did. Now I've played a full game of it, seen what's there, and don't care for it. It's in the trade pile.

Two players. It was okay for the first two-thirds, but then we hit some major snags towards the end:

1) The endgame is Talismanically irritating. Basically, I had to get through four Misbehaves and a skill roll to achieve the final goal and win the game. My opponent had to get through three Misbehaves to get the second goal, then move to where I was and do what I was trying to do. It was unlikely I wouldn't win, but to just give up seemed wrong. So we went through our respective motions. I failed twice, but so did he, so it was a prolonged battle for the places we knew we'd get.

2) Misbehave cards where you fail unless you have a specific character (River Tam). There are at least two of these. That is some bullshit game design and not only because River Tam was the most irritating part of the show. Also the Misbehave deck itself is so ridiculously random. This is exciting at first, but then it just gets tedious. Getting stopped on card #4 by something that can only be passed by one card in the game? About as fun as a kick to the head.

3) Jayne's Hat. This card bugged me for several reasons, most of them being how absurdly powerful it was. Having this won me the game, and all I had to do to earn it was find it in the deck first. Stupid.

4) The goals themselves. As with other games, it's a race, but the race is along a known course, so there's only one path to victory. Sure, there may be different ways to get to those checkpoints, but you still have to hit each one, in order, so you always know exactly where everyone is. 

5) When all was said and done we'd played for a little over two hours with two players. The Reaver ship did nothing the entire game and the Alliance ship did very little as well. With more players they'd probably do more but then you're talking about a longer game that still has other issues. If I'm playing for three hours anyway I'm going to go with Merchants and Marauders or Merchants of Venus and not this.

6) Jesus this thing is a table hog. Thirteen decks, plus their discards, plus the board, plus tokens, plus player boards. 

This game has two major competitors and I don't see where it offers anything over either. I've been told play time, but I find that hard to believe and also don't really care. I'd rather play a slightly longer but better game than a shorter and lousier one. Or just play a different game if that's all the time I have.

RATING: 10
This game is an easy 10. It scores high on the fun scale, regardless of whether you are a Firefly fan or not. But fans of the tv show 'Firefly' or the movie 'Serenity' get an extra bonus because the game is literally oozing the flavor and feel of the tv series. Its not often that a game both captures the look and feel of what its based on AND plays as well as this does. 

EDIT: After an additional number of plays, introducing a number of other players to the game, my review above stands. 

One additional note worth mentioning is that the base Firefly ships are really 'the best' ships for the game, because they are so well balanced to the game. The special ships that can added to the game through expansion purchases are generally more 'specialized' and not necessarily 'better'. For instance, the 'Jet Wash' comes with a few ship expansions that must be paid for, decreasing your starting credits. This can really have a detrimental affect on your first few turns, if you are not careful.

So it has taken me forever to figure out why I don't like this game. Firefly is a great show and yes, it was about picking stuff up in one place and delivering it to another place. Except that the show really wasn't about shipping at all. The show was about what happened between, during, and at destinations.

Further insight, Firefly (the ship itself) is a character in the show. Less so in this game.

---

This is not a "pick up and deliver" game. It is a race game. The first player to do [fill in the blank] wins the game.

The game seems to offer a variety of choices (1 of 8 possibilities for first action, 1 of 6 possibilities for second action). That said, certain actions are only available on certain spaces so the actual number of options is less. Thus "flying" is the main mechanic of the game. Unfortunately flying is repetitive (move, draw, move, draw...) and random (maybe movement ends, maybe not).

The game is too repetitive and too random for such a long game. To deal with the longness, the game tries to be strategic by having long term goals and added rules for searching discards. Unfortunately the strategic elements fail because the show was more tactical, as seen by the "fly by the seat of your pants" aspects of dealing with what the next bad thing to come your way.

Missed opportunities:
-- Some cargo tokens could have "?" on one side, so you don't know if you are actually carrying cargo or contra. (Same goes for passengers and fugitive tokens.)
-- Money was tight on the show. It is less so in the game.
-- The board is huge. It would be nice if there were spaces for the appropriate card decks next to the appropriate planets instead of the decks taking up even more space on the table.
-- The location of the Reavers Cutter is always known, so it can be avoided. Instead face down tokens could be used, where only one is actual ship, so the location is always unknown. 
-- Card organization seems backwards. The "instant" win condition is at the bottom of the mis-behaving card, but should be at the top so you don't read the rest of the card.

enjoyable, funny, sometimes clever, but way too long. their game time estimates are horribly off - we've never yet played a game in under 5 hours, which means Firefly doesn't get to the table very often. we've devised our own "jump start" because the recommended jump start in the rules was inadequate. for a faster game, we deal starting jobs then allow players to place their ship relative to the jobs they have rather than place ships then choose jobs.

The rulebook is pretty terribly written. The writer seemed much more interested in explaining how each rule has a thematic tie-in with the TV show rather than how to actually play the game. This makes certain sections appear not where you would expect them too, terminology confusing, and some rules to be ambiguous. Also, the examples don't come with pictures so they are hard to follow along.

I actually wasn't a fan of the show of the 4 or so episodes I've watched (I know, travesty!), so keep that in mind if you read the following.

I like how there are different scenarios that can be played, which is pretty rare for a game that isn't 1 vs. all or co-op. Also it's nice that they tell you that the intro one is a bit shorter. Overall they all have you perform a bunch of jobs, just some require you to do a specific goal-related jobs, so in practice they aren't hugely different. I think I prefer the ones that you need to get a certain amount of money more, because that incentivizes actually selling off cargo and what-not (otherwise for the ones where you just have to do certain jobs once your crew/upgrades are good enough you don't really care if you lose money, have your cargo seized, etc).

For the most part this game is very heavily pick up and deliver, on the lighter end of the weight spectrum. Go to certain sectors to pick up jobs, go to the starting location of the job to pick up whatever you're transporting, and then go to where you need to drop it off. All in all, outside of the misbehaving cards (in which case you should buy a bunch of stuff to up your stats first) and needing to be a little bit more careful navigating if you're transporting illegal goods or have a warrant on you, despite allegedly having 4 different job types.

The market decks are significantly different from one another in terms of what icons they give you, but since a lot of the icons and traits serve the same function, just applied for different skill tests/able to start different jobs, I'm not sure how much what you can find will change your play style. The leader you choose in the beginning though seems like they would change up play style at least a little bit.

I wish for the navigation cards when you try to move around had greater differences between them, but I liked the risk aspect of it and it was thematic.

Completing jobs for different people gives you different benefits, but they don't seem groundbreakingly different from each other, making each region of the map feel relatively similar.

The only interaction in this game is if you are in the same place as someone else you can trade/steal their disgruntled workers, and movement of the reaver/alliance ship. While a single instance of this can be game changing, it is still possible to have games where there is no interaction with the other players at all, besides possibly taking a more risky job because they are further ahead of you, and I think that is probably one of the bigger flaws of the game.

Some people might not like the art is just screenshots from the TV show, but not a big deal for me. The money is paper money but the artwork on them is gorgeous.

Expect to need a large play area for this game.

If you're a big fan of Firefly, I think this game is a must have. They definitely have tons of little quirks that make thematic sense (e.g. if you get in a fist fight your weapons no longer help you in the skill test, your crew demands payment which you can choose not to give, but then they become disgruntled and might choose to join other ships). If you're not into Firefly as I am, the game runs too long for what it is, but with fast enough players it is still moderately enjoyable as a thematic pick up and deliver game.

This is a game where YOU have to drive the ending.   So many people are used to games that will end based upon a built in timer.  Dick around long enough and the game will end no matter what, count vps and whoop, Steve is the winner!

 Firefly is like talisman in that if you fiddle around and never force yourself forward the game will never end.  People who call firefly an extremely long game either a) have no balls or b) have never played a long game

I am fully convinced at this point that the theme is half of the reason that I love this game, but it's definitely become one of my favorite solo games at this point. I really enjoy the pickup and delivery aspect, and I think the multiple job bosses really set this apart from other similar games. I wish there was a bit more of an ability to scry through jobs and items, but it's solid overall. The "Aim to Misbehave" cards are great too, requiring you to be prepared for anything.

I'm adjusting this one up after a few more plays.  

This fits a magical space where my noncompetitive friends enjoy playing it for the theme and the fun of the journey, and my competitive friends can play in the same game trying to block each other and slit their throats without ruining the game for the more casual people.  That's a really hard thing to get right, and my group isn't so especially fond of Firefly that they're giving the game more credit than it deserves.

This also feels like the spiritual successor to Starfarers of Catan to me, the only Catan game I ever liked (because it is nothing like Catan...), and one of my favorite games from when I was first introduced to "real" games.

A fun game with a great theme. The cards are all very thematic and fit in with how things happened in the show. For example, I had River Tam in my crew and she allowed me to roll a dice before every skill check and she may or may not add bonuses to the check. It perfectly fits with how River was in the TV show-- always doing her own random things but, in certain circumstances, be amazingly awesome and save the day.

Overall, I enjoyed playing this game however I don't think I need to have this in my collection as the play time is too long and I don't think it would hit the table very often. It really is an experience. You have to be committed to sitting down and playing for a few hours and getting involved in the world and theme.

RATING: 6
Type: 1-4 player space exploration and questing game, largely multi-player solitaire

Best with: 1-2
Weight: Medium
Duration: 3-5 long hours
Notes: 

Players take on the role of a Firefly-class space ship looking to complete quests, earn money, smuggle goods, raise a little bit of trouble planet-side, and reach game-winning goals before the others, all while avoiding both the law and the reavers.

There are some downsides. First, this game has an absolutely huge footprint on the table. The components are gorgeous, but the board is huge, the player cards are huge, there are many piles of draw decks around the board, and so on. This game requires a serious table to play, even solo.

Second, the game is also very long. It's not a really deep game, but it can get very long depending on which winning goal is used. This can make the game very boring.

Third, the game has almost zero means of interacting with other players. Beyond moving the reaver ship around, there is nothing one player can do to another. This is simply about racing around the universe and doing quests faster than the other player. There is very little chance involved as well, so it's not like you can hope for bad or awesome dice rolls to wipe out a lead.

Still, the flavor and artwork is just gorgeous, and if players are ok with the solitaire-like play, have a huge table, and don't mind the length, this game does look like it can be fun for Firefly fans.

A 'pick-up-and-deliver' game dripping with the flavor of the Firefly 'verse. Stays loyal to the source material without crimping the mechanics. Playable with up to 5 if you have the Dodger or Pirate expansions, but slows down considerably with 4 or more captains. Overall - Shiney. ^_^

There are a myriad expansions that add a lot a of replayability.

Rating after a single, five-player game. We played the easiest introductory scenario.

Frankly, this was pretty dreadful. The game's rules are typical ameritrash chaos, with lots of stuff you have to remember at any given moment, and the rulebook isn't very well organised at all. No index in this sort of game, really?

But the thing that killed it for us was that the game took twice as long as it should've, and the biggest issue is the downtime. Maybe it's less severe with four or three players, but with how little player interaction this game offers, maybe playing it solo is the best solution.

It's the sort of game that can be easily expanded, but its core gameplay needs serious tweaking to be even remotely enjoyable. The randomness of the Misbehave and movement cards is terrible.

Some good ideas in an overproduced, underdesigned title. A great shame, given how good the source material is.

RATING: 9
Excellent theme, fun to play. If you are a fan of the short-lived Firefly/Serenity series, you'll like this game. You are the owner/operator of a Firefly-class transport. You take on missions, fly around the 'Verse, wheel and deal, and try to make money. They did a great job of recreating the look and feel of the Firefly universe. You can play solo missions and avoid Reavers/Alliance ships, or play 2 to 5 players. There are also several expansions that add ships and missions.

I only have a couple of caveats. Although most of the cards, board, cash and other items are high quality and look great, I think the miniatures used for the various spaceships are a waxy-feeling plastic that seems chintzy and cheap. I do note that there are some very nice paintable resin miniatures available - for a premium price...

The other issue is the manual that comes with it. I don't think it's very good. The rules actually aren't that complicated, and I found watching a few reviews on Youtube really helped to explain how to play.

I've read a few complaints that the randomly drawn Reaver action cards are a little too powerful. You can be doing well in the game, then get attacked by Reavers and lose half your crew and get set back tremendously. To me, that's actually true to the TV series, so it's not a flaw for me.

Overall, very enjoyable!

Excellent pick up and delivery sci-fi game - Base on the Cult series.Some great mecahnics and as its a sandbox game you can easily get wrapped up in the fun of collecting crew/items/missions and lose time - Played a couple of times and you can easily add an hour to the times listed by the game to play - played a 3 hour friendly game (we didnt attack each other or stiching each other up) and it took 4 hours - Really enjoyed it though, Just make sure you set aside ample time

I don't normally buy games based on a TV show or movie, and only rarely on a book. I'm a dedicated Firefly fan though, so I thought I'd give this a try. It's SO much better than I expected -- the game engine is pretty standard fare for a story based game and there is some downtime, but it doesn't matter. It's a visit to The 'Verse and presents an experience very much in the spirit of the stories on the show. I have both expansions and most of the promotional items -- I don't know how much more content they can wring out of only 14 episodes and one movie, but so far, I'm not disappointed.

Slightly disappointed, as I was expecting something epic. The game seems very linear and almost too easy to succeed. Perhaps with expansions it gets better, but for the moment it leans heavily on the theme to be enjoyable for me. I mean, I'm not going to say no to piloting the serentiy with Reynolds as my captain. Far too gorram pretty to sell. Still very enjoyable in moments.

great quality of concepts gameplay and physical parts.  Dedication and care went into this game to make it not just a crappy game that matches up with some tv show.  This game rises up as a fun boardgame then BAM! it clicks, hey this random guy is from that one episode!

such a great releif to know this game isn't just some cardboard standups that go around and have the tv plot happen

Does an amazing job of capturing the feeling of the TV show. It is quite a long game and despite the numerous times that I have played it I have only finished 3 games, the other times we ran out of time and had to pack up. But even when we did not finish the game everyone enjoyed playing and agreed that it felt like Firefly. Would recommend playing with the Blue Sun expansion it makes the Reavers a lot more relevant. Also make sure that you have a large playing area because this is a big one.

Fantastic game based on a fantastic show. And with fantastic official and fandom support.

Firefly: The Game has enjoyed several, successive plays at my gaming group. I love the game. For me it's all about the fun, narrative and story line. The game engine and thematic content are excellent. The only niggles I have are: a) downtime between turns (long), and b) player interaction (none). But fortunately my gaming group are all Firefly fans and so we elaborate on the narrative element of the game between turns and let other players continue with their turns while we're still selecting jobs, purchases etc.

My first play was a boring slog.  I still have hope for this game, as it has style in spades, but i just don't see how they could have made such a cool universe so blah.

Move a space, draw a card, roll some dice... move a space, draw a card, roll some dice.  urgh...

no important decisions, most of the split card functions are false choices anyways (since there's an obvious superior choice based on your equipment/crew), player interaction is non-existent (wth?)... formulaic to the extreme.

RATING: 7
Very nice theme. Great for fans of the show. Top notch components. Not so much player interaction. Long playing time and fairly much down time. Fairly luck dependant. Many similarities to Merchant of Venus, but better theme and somewhat less randomness. 

Good game that grows with more playings, but nowhere near as good as the brilliant Spartacus (also a licence game from GF9).

The various expansions are a must. My rating reflects the game played with all expansions added.

All models painted.

Great component quality. 
They successfully captured the theme of the game through components and art to gameplay mechanics. 
The game is largely fetch and deliver quests, but it matches the theme of the show and does successfully make it feel like you are a ship captain trying to keep your ship and crew flying. 

Bad: 
Even with the expansion, there isn't all that much player interaction. 
Turns can be excruciatingly long if you have anyone that is AP prone. 
Lots of components to set up and put away.

Pick up and Deliver meets adventure game, in a way that actually works rather well to match the sort of frantic jobs, threats and time-tables of the show. Worried it may not have a ton of replay-ability with limited cards at each location, but it looks like expansions are planned.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I'm still not sure this will be able to capture the warmth and charm of the show BUT they did such a great job with Spartacus that I'm definitely willing to give it a try. 

Does this have enough player interaction. My group rarely plays games that don't have either hidden roles or tons of backstabbing. This feels like multiplayer solitaire?

Need to see more videos before understanding what the competitive edge is in the game... Is it just moving the robber (AI ships) into the space with another player?

Don't buy this - this is appearing on most people's lists as their most disappointing game of the year. Too long and too random.

Idea for greater player interaction. When you move instead of drawing a random card the your opponent can give you a card. You keep all the move cards you have drawn or draw randomly. Playing a bad event card hurt them in the short term but it also gives them more bad stuff to send your way later.

RATING: 6
The friends I play this with do not suffer from AP in any way (basically board games are something we do between rounds of drinking), so our game was not the long slog some users complain of. However, it is a longer running game. I am also a huge fan of the show, so I had a lot of fun trying it out and the game is a nice tribute to its namesake. However, jumping between systems take a lot of movement and it seems to be quite easy to avoid the Alliance and the Reavers. I suppose it depends on your playing style, but we stayed pretty close in score with few problems. Not the most exciting game ever, but fine if you find yourself in an Alliance friendly bar, come U-Day.

It's a neat take on the Firefly universe, with a few catches. Players really don't interact all that much, makes the game more of a race than anything else.

All in all, though, it's a pretty good romp and well made enough that it is pretty easy to play and teach.

We're long time Firefly fans and this game didn't disappoint. The goals to succeed are pretty tough, but that's the challenge. One variant we had to include in our house rules was the "magnetic rule" - because neither one of us really wanted to battle it out with the Alliance cruiser or run into the reaver ship. (We didn't want to hurt one another either - not quite to that cut-throat kind of stage yet) Anyway - the magnetic rule was one that moves these pieces one space towards the closest opponent after each move/play. That way - they almost become "hunters" rather than waiting for someone to run into them .... Makes the game a bit more challenging - but the goals already do enough on that front. Great concept and love all the pulls from the various characters and storylines from the show and the movie.

This is a game I played when my friend Dylan visited OH, years ago now. I still have a very negative feeling about it, because it just takes forever to play, and the mechanics mean that for large swathes of time, the game becomes solo play with few chances to directly interact (the moving of the Reaver ship is very indirect and limited)... and even worse, the jobs to get cash are just too resource-intensive to finish. And they are far apart. And it is just borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring.

Do not want.

Really excellent game. The expansions really add to the gameplay quite a bit and improve on some of the weaker points mechanically. Overall, a great interpretation of the Firefly universe into a really fun game with tons of replayability that can really be customized to just about any group of 1-7 players. If you are a fan of the show and a fan of board games, this is a definite must-have, though I have several friends who have never seen the show (I know, *gasp*) that still love the game.

Very cool thematic game... I think the game mechanics fit the theme very very well and it carries the whole experience...
If you liked the show you'll probably like the game, if you didn't see it or like it you probably won't enjoy the game as much as people that did... not saying that the game isn't good but, for me at least, the Theme and the immersion in it makes a huge difference in the enjoyment players can get out of this... 

I really liked it!

I really wanted to love this game, but it's an overlong snooze-fest, completely lacking in tension or difficult choices. The turns are so long that it forces you to either start overlapping turns (e.g., "You go ahead while I figure out what I'm going to buy"), or everyone sits and watches and waits, and waits some more, for their turn to come around. Overlapping turns sounds like a good solution until you've got 3 or 4 players simultaneously doing some portion of their turn, and nobody has any idea what the other players are up to, much less who's winning.

Worse yet, even your own turn is fairly boring. It's a very lackluster pick up and deliver game with no tension. Just make sure you buy enough gear and crew to have a decent shot at completing a job, then flip a few cards and see if you succeeded. Then do that a dozen more times until someone (finally, mercifully, can I go home now?) announces they've won.

This game is the essence of multiplayer solitaire. I've heard that some of the expansions fix this somewhat (most notably, the pirates expansion), but too little too late for me.

Traded.

RATING: 7
Firefly: The Game is yet another successful adaption of a TV show from GF9! It captures all the feel of the sadly short lived show- find a crew, find a job, keep flying!

The rules are a terror to explain and you should be prepared for this when getting set up for the first time (it takes me over 40 minutes to cover all the important nooks and crannies), and yet the game plays fairly smoothly when you actually get started!

Players manoeuvre their ships around the 'verse, making deals with big-dog contacts, shipping crew, cargo and contraband from place to place, and shopping for ship upgrades, crew and equipment. Its a space merchants game that works, and it works well at that. Mixed in with this merchant premise is a classic [i]Talisman[/i] style 'move your dude, draw a card, crap happens to you' adventure mechanic.

There's lots to do with plenty of important decisions to make. The game also has a spade full of luck too though, and sometimes it feels like the 'Verse just points right at you and says 'no'. When you are winning you feel mighty indeed, but when you are losing it feels like you are helplessly spiralling out of control with no way of return.

Due to this game's excessive length (usually 3+ hours) any major setback will not only cost you the last hour or two of effort but also put you out of the winner's race, making your whole game a demoralising losing battle. Uncomfortably I've had two players just quit the game outright in the few games I've played so far!

Different objectives and even a solo option give plenty of additional ways to mix up the overall feel of the game and causes players to recheck their strategy from time to time.

The expansions have so far also covered players looking for more direct confrontation with a Pirating & Bounty Hunting variants, as well as adding more complexity with different ships and plenty of extra places and items. Note though that as expansions are added in the game becomes increasingly over complex and fiddly.

Non-fans will probably get less from the experience, but if you are a fan of the show and maybe even just a fan of Sci-Fi Ameritrash this one could be well worth a visit!

Pimped mine up by hand painting the ships and swapping out the active player marker for an actual Stegosaurus toy.

Rating dropped from 9 to 7 over time as there always seems to be someone sat having a bad time and being miserable for 3 hours in every game! Misbehavin' without the proper preparation is the main mistake I've seen, which only leads to increasingly worse positions. Its usually 75% their fault due to bad decisions/rushing in too early and getting in a rut, but Firefly is one of those games that likes to punish players who continue to make bad decisions after their initial mistake.

The problem is I have encountered several gamers who after doing something reckless and messing up will then continue to make the situation worse by blindly trying again even though it didn't work the first time, making the situation worse for themselves over and over. Sometimes bad luck will then add on top of this making them even more frustrated and reckless, creating a vicious circle of self defeat, killing their chances and their mood. This bad atmosphere can sap a lot of the enjoyment and sense of accomplishment from the more successful players.

The most important tip for Firefly players:
Preparation, preparation, preparation. Better to have a slow and steady early game and then catch up at the end when you have everything you need to complete jobs first time around then risk blowing your whole game on Misbehave cards too early.

As a fan of the TV series I am a little disappointed by this game. The theme tries to bring out the TV characters but is quite thin over what is really a pick up and deliver game. That said, there are sme nice touches (art work) and tie-ins to the Tv series.
My concern is that the game takes far too long and the thrill of space trading begins to dull after the first hour or so, when you may well have less cash than you started with, even after successful trades. Fortune rarely favours the brave who dare to "misbehave" in this game and the penalties are harsh.
I still enjoy the game but just wish it could be much faster.

Good game and pretty thematic (even though I am not familiar with the series).  I enjoyed the game, but depending on the end game win condition, it can drag on for a while.  It is also very apparent that regardless of how well you play, if you don't have luck on your side, you are not going to win.  Still a fun experience.

Pick-up-and-deliver game with a fun IP. I love firefly. If I didn't this game would not be as good as it is. There's a few things here: firstly the game is HUGE. Get a bigger table, trust me on this one. The game can go very long, and if someone starts running away it very hard to catch them which can be disheartening. I enjoy this solo for the stories and the push your luck, because there's little player interaction, especially in the base game. Expansions mean you can attack each other but that also means the game becomes very douchey. On top of that the boarding and attacking is VERY difficult and I've never won a game trying to do that.

Okay, the game is crazy fun if you are a Firefly fan. The cards are the characters and gear from the show. The game is a bit long, but if you are having fun you don't notice that. Played it with a group of Firefly fans and every single person enjoyed it. Just bought the expansions so even more people can play at one time, but I reckon it will lengthen the game playing time. Watch a demo on how to play then read the rules. It make a little more sense that way and you can pick up on some of the terms a little easier. I highly recommend.

Pure, trashy goodness. Has a lot of the same qualities as Arkham Horror, which works well for me. It also helps that I'm a fan of the show. That aside, this game is just plain fun. I almost always play so that there's a race to X amount of money to see who wins, just because most of the other scenarios are a lot more tedious. One of the only games in existence that captivates me with both its pickup-and-delivery mechanisms and the way it captures its theme.

Also own the Whole Damn 'Verse mat.

Better than Merchants of Venus, Xia, and Merchants & Marauders.

RATING: 5
A superb game hampered by fatal flaws. Gorgeous components, great theme, some really fun mechanics. I'm a big fan of the show and film, and was really looking forward to playing this game...until I played it. It started out wonderfully - was easy to learn, and we were off to the races quickly. However, the issues make it a game I will not return to.

First, it is too long. Way, way, WAY too long. We played a scenario that was listed as being two hours. It took five. Five hours. With four very experienced players, who were not taking breaks or fiddling with their iPhones in between. If I'm going to play a game of that length, it has to have much more depth - Twilight Imperium, Eclipse, or Civilization come to mind.

Second, it is way too repetitive. Turning the navigation cards over again and again and again as you navigate through space becomes painfully boring. We hit the worst possible cards in the navigation decks repeatedly throughout the game, taking away their impact when they happened.

Third, it is way too punishing. Losing a single "Aim to Misbehave" challenge fairly early in the game can set you back hours as you lose your crew, causing you to spend a frustrating game trying to catch up to those who rolled the dice well.

Other people love this game - I will never play it again. I thought it was great at first, but once the true grind of playing it for so many hours set in, I was done. There is just not enough there to justify my time.

My rating of 2 is based on the selection criteria of I won't play it again ever in any circumstances and this is one of the very few games I can say that about.  

This does not mean it is a bad game.  Just not a game for me.  It simply did not click with me.  After playing 3 times I did not enjoy any of the games - not even the first which I won.  I felt it overstayed it's welcome by several hours.  I found the learning curve incredibly steep considering the limited choices.  It seemed to me detailed knowledge of the cards in each card stack for each planet was essential to make informed strategic choices.  Worse it punished those who fell behind.  Most modern games have a catch-up mechanism so if you fall behind you still have a small hope of winning.  

For me it felt slow, tedious multiplayer solitaire,  In all 3 games it seemed those in the bottom knew they were going to lose after the first couple of hours but had to pretend to have a great time for 4 or 5 hours while waiting for those who'd got ahead to finally win.

[Edit]
Upgraded to 3 after watching the TV show with my husband.
The game captures the feel of the TV show very well.
I still would never play it again:
1) It has no built in timer - in theory it could go on forever 
2) It feels like multiplayer solitaire
3) The constant drawing of cards to move each space slows things down to a crawl
4) For me it outstay its welcome after about 2 hours

I love the theme. The Firefly universe is awesome and captured well in this game.

That being said, the game is long and feels long. With four or more players the downtime between turns is huge. The card per space move mechanism seemed like a great idea to add some intrigue but it slows things down so much.

I'll happily play it again when there's time though.

Love the Firefly universe, but this game just seems too long for what it is for me to play very often.  Everyone just ends up flying back and forth doing jobs, not interacting, so in that way it simulates what being a trader/smuggler would probably be like in the setting; mostly traversing the empty reaches of space. There is practically no story present.

Have not played the expansions, although I hear they add some interesting aspects, I'm not interested in a game that needs expansions to be enjoyed.

Pick-up & delivery done right to me.
Lots of kinds of jobs, illegal, legal, crime,moral, shipping, transport, to do that you need to equip the ship with crew, gear, ship upgrades.

If you know the tv show you'll see the theme come through with the scenarios, jobs, crew, gear, etc.

If not it's a very enjoyable game nevertheless

And the show is very much in the cards with the quotes written in and related to what is happening with that card.  Phenomenal.

Great pick up and deliver game with a wonderful theme (although some may argue against that). There is a LOT of game there as we played with all the expansions, but it is surprisingly easy to pick up and learn despite that.

As with any game where you get mission cards, there is some degree of luck when you draw the cards, but this can be mitigated by the mechanism of looking though the discard pile and picking missions that may mean more to you than other players.

Fun game and had to stop myself just playing as a sandbox game and exploring the 'verse upgrading my ship and taking on new crew.

The graphic design is great, inspired by the series and consistent with it. The components are very good, even the insert.

It is a indeed a luck based pick-up and deliver game. There are no deep choices to be made besides pushing your luck or not at certain occasions. The tactic and strategic levels are very low, you depend mostly on the luck of the draw and the dice rolls.

What the game excels on is its theme. It manages to capture the atmosphere and he background of the Firefly series and Serenity movie in an impeccable way.

I would say it's a much lighter version of [thing=25292]Merchants and Marauders[/thing], with almost no interaction. I cannot say it's an excellent game, but I just love the genre and the theme.

Disclaimer: I have only played the introductory short adventure. Maybe the game experience changes with a longer serious mission.

Played twice.  The game was fairly repetitive, and given the length, it got kind of dull.   There isn't much depth to the game and luck is a pretty big factor.

Downtime was an issue, especially if players weren't planning ahead.  There was little player interaction.  Most Euros I enjoy feature a lot more interaction than this has.

Now, despite my gripes, its still a decent game - its fun building up your crew, flying around the galaxy, completing various contracts.  The Firefly theme is well-implemented.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]Somehow a year went by and I wasn't able to play Firefly again. This was mostly due to not being able to plan another session with my friend who got me the game. I'm hopeful that'll we'll get to play again soon, which may involve learning the rules myself and setting up a 2p game with my son and seeing how things go*. I'd still recommend this game if you're a fan of Firefly; outside of that I need to play some more to see how it compares to Merchant of Venus [i](which is my favorite space themed pick up and deliver game)[/i].[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This was a housewarming gift from a buddy of mine and on top of that he came over and taught us the game. Up front I'll mention that I am a huge Firefly fan, probably the best TV series I ever watched, so the first thing I need to mention is that this game delivers when it comes to taking advantage of the IP. I was lucky enough to get four members of the Serenity crew on my ship which was awesome. Everything in the game comes directly from different episodes of the show so you are fully immersed in the Firefly universe they whole time you're playing. 

Firefly felt a lot like Merchant of Venus if you added a healthy dose of screw your neighbor. I was able to sic the Reavers on the other players and poor Mike got smacked around twice by them. There is also some randomness in the game since you are continually rolling for skill checks and potential attacks, however you can hire crew with the skills needed to help offset the luck of the die roll. The different scenarios you can play change up the end game conditions for each game and can really change how you'll play the game. 

Overall I was surprised by how much I enjoyed my play of Firefly and I can't wait to play again. We are already setting up another play session, hopefully with four players this time. If you love Firefly you have to check this game out and if you enjoy pick up and deliver games with some take that thrown in I'd give it a shot too. I also need to mention that with teaching our game took two hours, but the time flew by and we couldn't believe how much time passed once we finished the game.[/i]

RATING: 7
It should probably be a 6 because there's so much stupid luck in the game, but the theme is nice and I'm sure that with more play you'll set up your crew and equipment so as to avoid most of the crap that the cards throw your way. You start with pick up and deliver quests that need to be fulfilled to earn money. Spend money to buy crew and equipment to amp yourself up. Then start tackling the hairy stuff that earns you big money, random hairy stuff like if you don't roll a 3 or more, you lose all your crew, or hey, if you roll 2+ you win the game (sure enough, I rolled a 1 and someone else won the next turn ... head shaking). If you can't tolerate that level of luck, don't play. Because if you over-invest to get rid of all the luck, you'll find someone else has taken some risks and won before you. On the upside, there's huge thematic goodness about who and what you can find at each location in the 'verse, with each major location represented by a deck you rifle through and purchase from. There's different scenarios so you can better match to the type of games you like. I'll play again, but geez I wish I'd had a better idea of the risk/reward offsets before that first game that went too long and was too frustrating because we kept attempting stuff when not as prep'd up as we should have been. Live and learn. But anyway that's a feel for the major decisions in the game ... how to plan your pick up and deliver stuff, when and what and how much to invest, when do you take risks. There's lot of rules wibbles about which side of the law you're currently on, whether moral or not, whether there's a warrant out on you not, whether you're an outlaw or not (carrying contraband or fugitives), all of which can have repercussions. Thematic goodness, but a few wibbles too far probably. If you're a fan you'll forgive it. If not, might be best to steer clear.

Fun! This is growing on me. Firefly: The Game is more of a very thematic experience than a game. It is a sandbox game with scenarios. Minor learning curve. Same type of game as Runebound and Merchants and Marauders. Settle in for a long experience. Good for people who like sandbox games, and story-like gameplay. Bad for people who need action-action-action over a game as long as this. Simply liking Firefly ain't enough criteria to enjoy this game. However, the graphics design and graphical art is top notch.

I ate this up. Every second. I can't wait to play it again. My Wife (gamer and Firefly fan) however was bored with it.

Warning: Need a big table. Also, AP Alert !!

RATING: 7
"Pickup and deliver, in space, with some shenanigans. Probably best if you enjoy going after each other, and/or with a bit of roleplay. My first 2p game only took 55 minutes, which was a pleasant surprise."

What I like:
- I generally enjoy pickup-and-deliver, and this is a pretty good implementation of that
- Space theme is nice, and there is lots of flavor
- Multiple scenarios
- Quite a bit going on, but not too much
- Solo scenario (but I don't know if it's any good)

What I don't like:
- I would prefer a bit less direct interaction (e.g. reavers)
- I can see where it could run quite long

I went into my learning game expecting a 3-hour marathon. But in a tight 55 minutes, I completed my 3rd goal to win the game. It's an efficiency race, so you don't want to get caught up in buying too much cool stuff, or taking on creative contracts. Unless of course you enjoy the game because of the cool stuff and illegal contracts, which I suspect is why my experienced opponent lost. 

My initial 7 rating is for the introductory scenario. I think the "respectable" scenario would probably also be a 7 but might be lower because it may take too long. Most of the rest of the scenarios are of no interest to me because I wouldn't want to be forced to misbehave. 

I would put the weight around 2.7, just a bit below BGG voters.

A race to collect the right crew and equipment to complete your jobs, with other players maybe forcing you to risk a job before you have the absolute best crew possible.  Not a bad game, but not something I'd want to play frequently.

Certainly one of the better licence to board game conversions ...rules are a bit loose and really a new edition of the rule book might be a good idea in order to assimilate the 7-9 pages of FAQ ...

Game play is pick up and drop off ...but could really do with a lot more PvP content not necessarily combat orientated per se ...

Overal though captures the firefly feel ...which to ardent fans like me is almost as important as game play ...

Issues with expansion card sizes as well ...thank goodness for sleeves ...

Long story short: I like this game. I really do. But is too fuckin' long for what it is. It really is.

I liked the first play of this VERY much. We played scenario where it is a race to get $15k. 2P game took 2 hours with explanation. But we we're moving quickly.

I wanted to go again immediately. Yeah, it is, at its core, pick up and deliver, but to call it just that is a gross oversimplification.

4/14- Several plays into it now. I am liking this more. In a few ways, it reminds of Talisman, a personal favorite. Yes, luck can play a large factor here. But the story builds out as you play the game. 

9/14- Over 5 plays in, I like this, but we haven't finished the last 4 games and I really hate calling it at a time constraint. We either need to find a way to make it shorter, or not play it. 12/2016 - sold it.

RATING: 6.5
6 Plays - This game is about building a strong card tableau, while managing jobs and travel risks. The very limited player interaction really is a real negative, as is the use of the alliance and reaver ships which could have been implemented in a way that had a lot more significance throughout the game. Mostly, players simply move them about meaninglessly, resulting in them feeling superfluously annoying (mechanically). Players rarely need to give thought to either avoiding them or moving them. Occasionally though, the alliance and reavers will suddenly 'appear' and can be very brutal to a single player. The issue being that both their target and timing of appearance are both random, sometimes simply cancelling your chance to win and repeatedly beating the same player to tears. 

If you don't like Firefly the show, then you probably will enjoy this less - all the cards etc. make reference to something in the show which help the game make thematic sense. We always have Firefly playing softly in the background while playing this game. Plays fairly well solo & 2 player, plays great with 3. 4 is good, but down time is an issue. 

The cards are negative for a few reasons. 1. There's just so damn many of them! 5 decks of jobs + 5 decks of items + the misbehaving deck + 2 travel decks + discard piles for each = 26 decks... did I count them all even? Also, we found the job cards quite busy and people often missed cash bonuses they were eligible/ penalties or eligibility requirements (which is in turn affected by crew changes). Not sure if there was a solution here for a more 'intuitive' job reward system (though this is more a nitpick).

Often my partner and I play co-operatively i.e. we both select a solo mission each, and slightly adapt the rules as needed. Home brewed scenarios are relatively easy to formulate (like really easy), as are adaptations that can lengthen, shorten or change game play to suit players.


Finally, your card tableau is built quite slowly at first, but later, even the hardest challenges become almost 'too easy' to overcome with your well-rounded crew. The tableau is really fun to build, as you capitalise on every opportunity that the 'verse throws you, but is rather anti-climatic! 

Final thoughts? This is a game with problems from both a component AND mechanic perspective. So, so many decks of cards that contain so much information! The tableau is fun to build, yet the biggest challenges are at the beginning when you're still rallying a crew, rather than at the end when you're polishing your weapons. The largely dormant alliance and reaver volcanoes are a missed opportunity that occasionally erupt with game-melting, luck-spraying lava. Yet, it feels like Firefly and it is REALLY fun to travel inside this unique world. The integration of luck DOES add some brilliant tension that makes for great stories and moments. This is definitely the kind of game you'll recount with your friends afterward, though you will probably inevitably note its flaws as well.

What a great game.  Played a bunch of times... didn't win many of the games.  Didn't matter.  Really captures the feel of the show, while also being a fun game.  Lots of cards all over the place so you'll need a good sized table to play... especially if you purchase the expansions that expand the length of the board.

Need to play this more but liked it more than I thought I would. 22/12/14

Update: I think I was too quick to rank this one as a 7 after one play. played this again with the Blue Sun expansion and this one really overstayed its welcome for me personally (the other three love it because of the series).We played the scenario Patience's War. In the end I just feel Merchants and Marauders does everything better. Maybe if we played with the Pirates expansion it could improve the game some. We will have to see. Now a 5. 20/1/15

Update: Meh definitely not a 5 anymore as I don't want to play this again. A 3.

This game feels a lot like playing the "standard rules" in FFG's Merchant of Venus.  It's generally a pick-up-and-deliver game, but you can be waylaid (often for multiple turns) by bad card draws, resulting in turns where you accomplish nothing.  The theme is a plus here, as you definitely feel like you're navigating the Firefly universe.  However, the "named characters" from the show feel somewhat overpowered, if you're lucky enough to draw one.  I like both Firefly and the pick-up-and-deliver experience, so I can overlook some of the flaws of this game.  However, the "classic" Merchant of Venus is a much better game in this genre.

Thematically captures the show nicely. Components are quite good. The game is fairly boring, and  there is too much luck and not enough player interaction. A lot of the missions seem pretty repetitive as well. The play time is too long for a game with so much luck. Take out some of the luck, add variety and player interaction, and cut the play time a bit, and this would easily go up a point. Or just avoid it all together since it's nothing special.

I love Firefly and was excited to try this game.  I felt it captured some of the essence of Firefly well and gave some different options to play it.

The UK version included a fifth player option and incorporated the Artful Dodger expansion. My US version only caters for up to four players. Annoyingly, I've not so far been able to track down a reasonably priced copy of this particular expansion - I guess because most owners in the UK didn't need it.  I do have the rather nice 'Whole Damn 'Verse' vinyl map that can be used to replace the main board and that of the expansions.

I've only got to test-play it some with multiple people, but played a solo game by myself.  I lost by one turn when I thought I was doing well.  I quickly realized the mistakes I made, meaning if I had done 'Pretty Well' I would have won, which makes me think the game is well balanced.  Solo play lasted about an hour, as the card said.  I'm looking forward to longer games soon.

Hire you a crew, git ya some shootin' irons, maybe some fancy duds, and declare it time for some thrillin' he-roics.  If you're a fan of this cult classic cancelled long before its time, you'll love the flavor of this game.  If not, you'll find this a pale comparison to better-designed commerce-based games like Merchant of Venus.  The inclusion of brilliantly designed paper play money is a thoughtful touch that sets this game apart, IMO, from those which settle for mere cardboard-token money.  :)

The exansions are a bit frustrating (I've played them at a friend's house) as they chose to add new boards to either end, creating a super-long board that is difficult to fit on a table and hard to gather a group around.  Aside from that, though, the expansions add a ton of fun and new cards and mechanics, including the opportunity to go pirate and prey on other players, which changes the game from a mere race for riches to a very cutthroat space brawl.

Great Theme but not a lot of interaction between players.  The secret is truly to "Get a Crew, Get a Job, keep flying."  In that order.

Might be best as a solo game.  Alternately, playing with a group but outfitting everyone like the solo rules where everyone starts with $X worth of crew.  This will shorten the game and allow it to get moving faster.

This is a sandbox game - do whatever you like, do however you think it's best for you or the story that develops. Wonderful game play, rich with theme, coherent graphics and fotos from the show, lots of scenarios to ensure nearly endless replay value. Even gamers who haven't watched the show were immediately drawn to that game (and watched the show afterwards to instantly become fans).

Played one (long and extended) solo game, and it was pretty fun. There is a lot to explain to new players, and it's definitely going to be a barrier to getting it on the table with people. Would very much like to play with the group, but honestly it might be a bit... boring? There is little player interaction, and the game quickly devolves into flying around, picking up stuff, flying around, dropping off stuff. Want to give it more chances, for sure.

7.5 - I enjoy the game and think it's fun, but I have to be in the mood for a multiple hour game to be willing to break it out. Thanks to the theme I'm usually in the mood but if I had one complaint it would be that the games end very abruptly.  Most of the time playing the game is building your crew, gathering tools and doing a few missions, but once you have a solid crew and start the main goal it's often three quick jobs and then, "That's goal three, I win!" without much notice.

Takes a while to set up, a longer while to play, but the game is fairly simple to teach and learn.  If it weren't for the abruptness of the way the game ends it would be a slam dunk because I'm a giant dork for Firefly.

Really great game with lots of inside jokes and a good atmosphere - almost every aspect and part of the show makes its way into the game!

A little warning: if some of the players are maximalists, the game can get much slower than anticipated - with a group of four we could easily go over 4 hours for the third play (and not the beginner mission)! The luck has little role if you are prepared - but you need to know the game a little for this. Also, some cards are much stronger than others - for this, you also need to know the game. So give it more tries if you at first don't feel it to be fair (some player has it easy with a strong crew, some other draws very hard misbehave cards...).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game rocks.  Loads of theme that works.  The components are top rate.  There is so much to do and it works. True to the TV show and movie.  Did I mention it has great theme? 

Easy to understand rules.  Yet a little quirky on how they were written.  Yet easy to work with.

Feels like a Fantasy Flight game which I love most of their games.  

This game is a blast to play with 1,2,3, or 4 people.  Not too long but long enough.  In fact, when you get done, you want to go right back in and do it again.  

I do wish there were more mission cards.  But with expansions, and I can see lots of that coming to make the game have even more depth, this game will continue to grow and become even more fantastic.  

The only thing I wish was that I made the game.  But I am glad someone did.  Great fun for all fans of Firefly.  I think knowing the TV series and the movie really helps.  And I do.  So can't say what it would be like for those who don't. 

Great job.  Buy it now.

disclaimer: I can recognize almost every element of this game and the episodes they come from.

Playing this game is a lot like roleplaying. I think it would be fun for people who haven't watched the show (but way more fun if you do watch the show). Each game has different goals and stories- which is really fun! A two player game takes 1.5-2 hours. A three player game takes two hours. It's not very interactive (2 player), unless you do a lot of pirating and trading (happens more with 3+ players). It's pretty hard to sneak up and do pirating in a two player game (I usually just do two player). You can win by playing it pretty straight, but you can also engage in human trafficking (which is unsettling at the very least - but usually not profitable so whew).

It seems like it would be difficult to teach, but it actually doesn't require too much explanation to get started, and you learn best as you go along. I usually explain the game as people go pretty effectively, advising on how different elements work as they come up. My dad usually gets pretty flustered with some of my board games, and he navigated this one pretty effectively. He didn't do any amoral jobs and maybe only a couple illegal ones.

RATING: 5
August 2013: One game, four players, 3.5h. I've watched several episodes of Firefly and enjoyed them, but I'm not a fan of the show; the theme of the game is not that important to me.

The game reminded me a lot of [gameid=131646]: it's a pick-up-and-deliver game with a lot of upgrades you could apply to your spaceship. It's less strategic, has more luck, and a little bit less player interaction (there isn't much player interaction to begin with). However, the integration of theme is impressive. So I'm rating it a 6, the same as Merchant of Venus.

[b]General course of play[/b]: On your turn, you can perform two actions. The available actions are: move your ship, purchase upgrade cards, obtain contracts or "job" cards, and pick up or deliver goods. You can't do the same action twice. Winning conditions vary. The game comes with six scenarios, including one solitaire one. Some of them involve getting a certain amount of money, others involve successfully doing a number of skill checks at certain locations.

[b]Some more detail[/b]:

[b]Pick-up-and-deliver[/b]: The route planning is much simpler than MoV. No pre-printed routes. You are moving in an irregular grid. There are two regions of the board, an "alliance" region, and those outside that region (forgot the actual names, and I'm not a particularly a fan of the show). The big difference between the region is that the neutral alliance ship can attack you in the alliance region, the reiver ship outside the region. 

There are five spaces/planets from which you can pick up upgrades and five others from which you can pick up contracts, or jobs. Some upgrade and job spaces share the same space. These spaces vary by what kind of upgrades and jobs they have to offer. This is a bit less than the 12+ planets that MoV offers.

[b]Strategy[/b]: There is no supply-and-demand mechanic like in MoV. Instead, there is a deck of upgrade/job cards associated with each upgrade/job space. If a player is at an upgrade/job space, he or she goes through the *entire* discard deck and selects up to three cards. Then he or she takes more cards from the face down deck until he or she as a total of three upgrade/job cards. Then the player can buy (or select for job cards) a maximum of two cards from those three. So if a lot of players are obtaining cards from one particular space frequently, the player last to arrive at that space has a smaller choice of known cards. So there's some player interaction as players try to be the first to a particular planet to buy a certain discarded card or to draw one. 

Many of the upgrade cards give a +1 or more modifier to three statuses: fight, repair, or negotiation (I forgot the actual terms). Many things you do in this game requires a skill check: delivering a good, picking up a good, or moving one space with your ship. The skill checks focus on one of these three statuses. However, apparently the best strategy is to maximize all three statuses so that you're able to pass all types of skill tests, because the nature of these skill tests is random. I'm not sure if it's a valid strategy to focus on less than three statuses, or to focus more on ship upgrades (those that for example make you go move faster or require less maintenance).

[b]Player interaction[/b]: It's pick-up-and-deliver, and those games generally have low player interaction. As mentioned before, there's subtle player interaction for upgrade/job cards that players can obtain at particular planets. When players are sharing a space, they can trade resource with each other. Players sharing a space can also steal crew members from each other under certain conditions. (Crew members are like upgrade cards.)

Another source of player interaction is the race aspect of the game. Players compete to accomplish the same goals. You can either fully equip your ship before attempting these goals, or try attempting them with the risk of losing crew members or other detrimental effects. I think this is one reason why I lost my game of Firefly; I didn't consider accepting the riskier jobs (which pay out much more) until later in the game.

[b]Fiddliness[/b]: Less fiddly than MoV; there are way more counters in MoV than in Firefly, and MoV's supply-and-demand mechanism adds more fiddliness. However, upgrades and jobs are all represented with cards. Considering you can have four ship upgrades, six crew cards, and three active jobs (without any other upgrades that increase these limits), this game takes up *a lot* of space.

[b]Summary[/b]: In Firefly, the luck factor is considerable, interaction is a bit too subtle (no negotiation and minimal situations where you can directly attack an opponent) and the game drags a bit (our first game, four players, took 3.5h). However, the integration of theme is excellent, so fans of the show, especially non-gamer fans, should enjoy this game. It's a game I wouldn't request to play again, but I would love to introduce it to (patient) non-gamers who love the Firefly series.

RATING: 6.5
Played this game with 5 players with me being a newbie. One guy was AP and this game took 5 hours. This one is not worth that timeframe. It's a bit too lucky. There is a certain epicness to the game, but it is very lucky for such a lengthy game. I give this one a 6.5 because I do appreciate it and know it is a solid game, but for me personally, I don't love this one. I would be willing to play it again at three players with non-AP players. I also have no connection to the theme. So if I liked the theme I would probably put this one at about a 8.

There may be a ton of luck involved with all of the dice-rolling and random card draws (especially the Misbehave deck), but it's undeniably fun to zoom through space fending off Reavers and Alliance patrols while smuggles illegal goods and trying to keep your crew happy.  A year ago, you never would've caught me buying a board game based on a TV show license, but in the end, the theme is what really sets this game apart from anything else, and Gale Force 9 has once again proved they know how to set the tone.

It's far from perfect, but Firefly fans have enough reason to give it a try.

RATING: 4
I like the idea of the game and I've even watched and enjoyed the show/film, but the execution of the game is a little disappointing.

My experience has seen a lot of downtime between turns, especially when someone browses for crew/items on their first action, then full burns for their second.

Some of the 'Aim to Misbehave' cards can be impossible to defeat unless you have River Tam, and if you're unlucky enough to draw one after you've already completed one or two to try and get a goal, it can feel like a real punch in the gut, especially as they can often have devastating consequences to you being able to attempt the task again.

Pick up and deliver game with excellent integration of the TV show theme. Crew members, bosses, jobs, equipment. It's all there. And it works. Plan routes, manage risks, deal with setbacks.

Two big problems: almost no interaction, and it's very long. So you want everyone to plan their turn in advance and work out results independently so the next player can crack on. Which means you don't really take any notice of that other players are doing. And that sucks.

RATING: 7.5
If you never have seen the tv series, I am not sure if this is the game for you. 50% of the fun is playing with the old characters which I loved so much (and still do) from the tv series.

But objectively speaking, if you have never seen the series (and you should) it is still a great game. Some of the artwork, especially the supply cards are not that great. This is a huge contrast with the 150 credit bills that look amazing. The game mechanics are ok-ish. There is not a lot of interaction between the players and if you play it several times it can get a bit boring. Basically you would do missions to get money and you need money to buy a crew and nice gear. With a good crew and gear you’ll try to accomplish the story card. There is a lot of luck involved with getting a good crew and gear and drawing the better missions. It would be nice if the game integrated a way to play more tactical. 

There are six story cards, and for every game you pick a story card. A story card is a different way to win the game. In my opinion, six cards was not enough. They should have doubled the amount of cards.

The game uses cleverly the characters from the tv series and there are some great references to the show I love so much. For that it’s worth every penny. I hope they will release some (big box) expansions that will solve all the game mechanic flaws. The game is not as solid and as shiny as I would like it to be, but I will forgive all that, because it’s a Firefly game!!!

After 5 plays and with the blue sun expansion, here it is. If you are a firefly fan, looking to travel the verse, dodging reavers and staying one step ahead of the alliance all wrapped up into a long evening's entertainment then this ticks all the boxes.  
If you are after a generic pick up and delivery game, there could be better out there. Having not played them though, I couldn't yet recommend. However, Xia, Merchants & Marauders, Merchants of Venus may be worth a look.

A few years on and i've finally played the above mentioned games.  Each have distinct features which i really like;
- merchants & marauders - the goods change each time from a port.  Really disliked the different captain ability, which try to shoehorn you into specific roles.
- merchants of venus - the route planning & low, medium & high market pricing are nice touches.  Can be hosed by a bad dice roll.
- xia - will have to revisit this one.

Overall, firefly is for role players who want to be immersed in the verse. Other pick up and delivery games have better streamlined mechanisms but lack character. So it becomes a matter of personal preference.

The expansions do help fix some issues in the base game.

As a big Firefly fan, I love the quality of the components and all the love that went into this game.

As a gamer, though, I just can't quite get this game to "click" with me or my group.  The length is a bit of a problem, but I think the biggest issue is just how many moving parts there are to this game -- so many decks, public discard piles, and hands to keep track of that it really makes the game feel a bit more clunky than it is.  Coupled with the general lack of interaction between players in such a long game and it makes for a less-than-ideal immersive experience.

Captures the feeling of the show. You find the crew, find a job and keep flying. Lots of quotes and jokes from then show.

Played 3 player games, some downtimes during other people turns, not that much interaction. I guess that 4 or 5 player game would be to slow.

Great graphic, good feeling when playing. My friends really enjoy the game.

11.8.13 I had never seen the show, so my view is just of the two game plays. First, this game is a pickup and deliver game at it's core. You must like that or the game will seem repetitive. I enjoy the way the incorporate the theme into the game and how crew and items help shape your firefly. All the components are very well done but man does this game take up some serious table space. The game seems to integrate all the aspects very well but never seems hard or convoluted. There is some randomness and until you get a crew going, you may just get some bad luck. All in all a fun game that runs a little on the long side if you don't watch it. Your mileage may vary depending on how much you like: the show, randomness, low player interaction, and immersion.

Very thematic. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's theme over game, since there's not really much of a game here. 
The beginning can drag a bit, and it's very frustrating to wander around and never really find any crew to hire. You're really at the mercy of the deck draws. 
I can see how multiple plays would reduce play time, but the initial play can be quite long and painful if you don't come to terms with the meandering nature of play.

Soooo loooong. I think if you keep the players 4 or lower and all agree to never use the dumb full burn mechanic it could be alot quicker and a more enjoyable game. Another play under these conditions may yeild a higher rating. The missions are quiet difficult early on as i feel the early game is meant to be a period of crew and item building then go attempt the well paying jobs. Game was a close finish which is a must for me to like a game.

First purchase at GenCon 2013
The UPS store at GenCon used NO packing materials and the game arrived busted up. When I wrote and filed a claim, UPS came and took the box and the busted games that I can't replace because they aren't out yet...and haven't contacted me about refunding my money, either.

Four weeks later, still a dead loss.

Note added: four months later and still a dead loss. I recommend avoiding the UPS booth at GenCon. It is privately owned and they have never returned even one of my several calls about the insurance claim.

GaleForce 9 games were a bit odd when I wrote to explain the situation and ask if they would allow me to BUY a replacement copy given the circumstances. They seemed to think I was running some kind of con on them (even though I gave them a link to the UPS claim). 
I wanted to buy a replacement for the Post GenCon Meetup game day, since several people had asked about playing it. GaleForce 9's response was a bit insulting. They accused me of trying to get free games out of them after I asked if I could buy another pre-release copy. They rather ranted about it.  
I thought it couldn't hurt to ask, but am feeling a bit rebuffed. Now I'm trying to decide whether I want to give them my money again for a second copy.  

Update to add:
Jeremy bought this, so I got to play it. It's a decent pick up and deliver game.

Perfect variable very long game with fast rounds.
A must have for Firefly fan.
One of the best games I ever played.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Tactics and skill are way more important than luck.
- Massive variability (different ship upgrades, crew, gear, jobs, events).
- Fast action paced playing. If you are not on the move, you are thinking about next round so you don't have time be bored.
- Jokes: Perfectly connected with Firefly series. Every card, person, ship, name and even the principle of the game itself. Everything will be familiar (and funny) to you if you've watched the series (but game mechanics are also very entertaining for those who haven't).

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Very, very, very long games (about 5-6 hours for 4 players).
- Even after a lot of rules learning, there will be still questions about specific situations. This can be frustrating (this [url=http://www.fireflythegame.com/howtoplay/FAQ.aspx]official FAQ[/url] certainly helps).

[b]Cons (1st play):[/b]
- Before your first game you must learn 18 pages of rules. Then you can teach your friends all of that rules in about an hour. If they are willing to learn, then all of you will be rewarded by excellent game mechanics and fun.

Although it tends to be a bit on the long side, Firefly is one of the better games of roaming around space and doing odd jobs for shady characters. It basically comes down to picking up cargo of one sort or another and taking it somewhere, but this is done well enough that it doesn't become a chore. If you're a fan of the series you'll also get a bit of a buzz from risking taking work from Niska or scorning Badger's job offers. 

When I first played it I was told that the Blue Sun expansion is borderline essential, and I agree with that assessment. Aside from enlarging the (already huge) board, it makes Reavers much more dangerous than in the base game and thereby adds some welcome tension to proceedings.

Slightly confusing rulebook at first reading, fairly straightforward gameplay, but sometimes hard to get an overview. Even though the actual board isn't very large, you'll need a very big table for all card piles, player boards and other paraphernalia. Most entertaining for fans of the show. Somewhat similar to Merchants and Marauders in the general gameplay feel. You'll definitely want to avoid playing this with people who suffer from analysis paralysis or those who can't plan ahead. Games can drag on for quite a while if you run out of luck and get caught by the Alliance, get parts of the crew killed off, or suffer other mishaps. You seem to have to build your strength for quite a while before attempting to complete story goals. Card names and quotes are rather good, and taken with misbehaviors actually make up entertaining, abstracted little adventures in all their brevity. All in all a better game than I thought it would be, despite being disappointed at first by the limited element of player interaction.

I'm not sure what I'm doing that causes this game to run way longer than it does for everyone else. I've looked over the manual several times and I don't think it's a rules issue.

The game is just way too long and non-interactive. It does an admirable job of implementing the theme, but the game is just dull.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
As many others have mentioned, the theme is beautifully incorporated into this game. The art is great, the copy is great, and  every single game component is some sort nod to the Firefly franchise. The one game I've played was fun for everyone involved, including non-gamers who were on board because they enjoy the franchise. My overall opinion is a great way to game with people who might not otherwise play board games, but that it lacks the depth that one might associate with such an apparently complex game. I had fun, but as a moderately avid gamer, there's lots to quibble about, and it wouldn't ever be a top pick for me.

First, there's a bunch of fiddly mechanics that can be hard to keep track of, mostly involving conditional bonuses - I found Firefly more challenging to keep track of than some of my most convoluted games of Flux. Some of the conditional modifiers are fairly easy to track, such as missions that require a character who is a "pilot" or "mechanic", but others were not. As an example, I ended up with three different upgrades that impacted the outcome of a "salvage operation" card, on three different types of upgrades (ship upgrade, crew, and equipment), marked with inconsistent font/color combinations. Since salvage operations are uncommon, when one did come up for me I forgot about two of my modifiers until much later. Another tricky case was a character who had a modifier for a "crime" job, which is somehow different than an "illegal" job and marked in a different place on the job cards. You can end up with some fairly convoluted effect chains. It got to the point where I wished I had a computer tracking all of this because I was constantly needing to review all my cards whenever a new card was flipped.

The time estimates for scenarios seem quite low. I imagine that a group of experienced players who are aggressive (i.e., banking on lucky dice rolls instead of on slowly building up a crew) might be able to play short games, but most groups will be in for at least three hours. Our game lasted five, and it felt fun for the first couple and then began to really drag by the end.

Experience will matter. There's a natural game progression that won't be immediately obvious to new players who aren't familiar with the contents of the contact and supply planet decks - some contacts tend to offer easier jobs than others and some planets offer cheaper upgrades. Knowing where to find things will definitely make a big difference for early success as well as game duration.

Reward and punishment are too random for my tastes. The "big damn heroes" supplemental cards can create a game-breaking income if someone luckily manages to acquire several of them. One player repeatedly failed a job because she kept unluckily drawing an "aim to misbehave" card that prevented advancement unless you happened to have River Tam in your crew. I lost a huge load of contraband necessary for a job due to a random card flip I had no way of avoiding. There's no way to deterministically get contraband, so I thought I was screwed until a couple turns later when the stars aligned to allow me to replace everything I'd lost.  Combine all of these with the length of the game and you'll probably end up with players who are frustrated with poor luck despite reasonable decisions.

I quite liked the trading mechanic in the game and actually felt like some of the loftier goals were getting in the way of my just bopping around the 'verse making money. In fact, I eventually lost because I got so distracted doing fun trading jobs instead of keeping my eye on the prize.

I was with a group of people who weren't aggressive towards each other, and as such it sometimes felt like we were all playing solo (well, we were "racing", but watching progress was a bit challenging). There was little reason to trade or interact with other players. There's nothing that forces players to move the Alliance and Reaver ships onto each other, so they were just left floating around safely until someone got unlucky with a card. It was easy to wander away from the table while other players completed their turns without it being a problem, which started to happen more and more frequently as the hours wore on. I found myself wishing that the game was either more cooperative or more competitive.

As a side note, I highly recommend the "Bastion" video game soundtrack as background for playing Firefly. It's nice techno-western music that goes great with the theme.

Solid - I like this. The components and integration of setting are up to the publisher's usual superlative standard, as is the price - I'm sure they could have asked twice as much and got it.

However, there are better games in the genre. Merchant of Venus is better as a game - flows much better and has real economic drive. Merchants and Marauders is tighter as an adventure game. But, if you love Firefly and you like adventure games, aren't too fussy about the rigour of the ruleset, then run don't walk, it's a gem.

RATING: 8
I've read a lot of comments that this game is "like Merchant of Venus", and while I understand why people draw these lines, they don't seem terribly accurate. The basic framework is very reminiscent of MoV. You have a spaceship, you're flying from point A to point B for a number of moon rocks. But that's really where it ends. MoV is a very streamlined game, sure there are a few non-intuitive points to it, but it has much less overhead than Firefly.

Firefly is more of a mix of Talisman and Arkham Horror. From AH it takes the specific card deck per location system, from Talisman it takes the concept of building a crew and armory that continually pushes your stats higher, the game is typically a race to complete a number of goals, and the travel mechanism, while I feel very innovative, even feels like Talisman's blind card draw on the "Draw 1 card" spaces. Firefly features skill checks similar to found in both the above games.

So saying it's like MoV isn't very fair to the game's actual heritage, as there's much more Talisman and AH in it's blood and MoV makes up it's skeleton of being a space delivery game, with none of the important features that makes MoV what it is.

Now that that's out of the way, I find this game to be a lot of fun. This is a space adventure game, and while it draws a lot from Talisman, it's multitudes beyond Talisman in design.

RATING: 7
This is normally not my type of game: lots of cards to read, thematic text everywhere, and luck.

But I actually liked this one quite a bit. It played well with two players and didn't take too long when we tried the introductory scenario. The luck can be mitigated somewhat by collecting good crew members and items. Many of the cards are fairly similar when working the different jobs, so there wasn't too much fiddly stuff to learn. And my wife and I generally enjoy pick-up-and-deliver games, which Firefly has quite a bit.

I will play this one a couple more times before I decide what kind of rating to give, but it's good so far.

If you have 4 hours, and you like Merchant of Venus...go play a couple games of MoV.  

OK, to be honest, the game wasn't bad.  But after two hours playing the recommended starting scenario, it became very obvious that the 2 hours playing time, like the cake, is a lie.

If you really want to give this one a try, you should start with the $12,000 for Last Call option.  No, seriously.  2 hours of playing a 4 player game - where 3 people had already played before - and 1 person finally achieved the FIRST goal in the recommended starting option.  There were two more yet to go.  

All that being said, the game looks great - even the paper money is nice...but...

One of the best "licensed" games I've played; it captures the spirit of the show very well.
It loses a point for the randomness - whilst I admire the intent of finding a balance between risk taking and preparation, there are too many "doesn't matter, you are screwed" cards.  And there are simply too many cards scattered across a large board.
But it manages to keep the interest throughout what ought to be a lengthy play session, which gives it more depth than it probably deserves.

RATING: 8
Mechanics very well married to the theme. Restrained in its use of the "main" characters so that they don't overwhelm the narrative, and you can do quite well enough without them if need be, while still maintaining the overall feel of the world.

The suggested first story card seems a bit too long for what it should be, but even that does not flag my interest.

Great effort to bring the 'Verse to gaming. A bit of a learning curve for casual gamers. A bit too much RNG for serious ones. The latter shows GF9 picked sticking close to the story over game balance. Sometimes you wind up in a broken-down ship with a bullet in your belly and that's the way it goes.

Looking forward to the various expansions, especially if we get more story cards.

Pretty entertaining adventure game.  I'm sure it's even more fun if you're a fan of the series, but I never really watched it and I had a good time.  Seemed to run a bit long with 4p, but the turns are quick, especially if your 2nd action ends at a supply or contract spot where you can look through the pile while the next person starts their turn.  Most of the fun of the game is in the experience as the gameplay is nothing new or special.  GF9 must have their eyes on long games as this and Spartacus both share the similar play over a long-period of time mechanic.  I'd play again, but not something I need to play every week.

Been a fan of the show and the universe for a long period of time.  Was super excited when I learned of the game.  So far, seems quite thematic and true to the show.  I've not had the chance to fully explore it yet and have unfortunately been having some difficulty getting it played.  Still, so far there is enough to keep me engaged.  It doesn't hurt that it uses some true pick up and delivery (though limited and very simplified).  Haven't played enough to decide if the complaints of some others are reasonable.  Looking forward to finding out. [06/25/2014]

The theme is really the only thing carrying this game, without it I probably would never touch it again.  The actual mechanics are nothing special at best.  The gameplay is somewhat slow with a lot of downtime between turns.  This game is also fairly heavy on the die rolling luck.  Add to this the luck of misbehave cards, job cards, and item/crew cards and it is a lot.  This is especially true for a game of this length.  

If they had managed to cut it down to an hour it would be a lot more bearable.  Still, if you have a group that likes Firefly and board games then this is something to consider.

RATING: 5
The game is thematic in the way in which the verse is recreated (all the planets, all the characters.)It recreates the conceit or McGuffin of the Firefly TV show. That is you are in a ship, doing missions. Other players are in other ships doing missions.

Go here, do this, get that, then go here, do this, get that.  Oh here's a Wash card you add to your crew. It helps you go here, do this, and get that. Same for all the main characters.

It's in this way that this boardgame doesn't really capture the heart of the show. That is one crew with very different personalities, each having demons and mysteries haunting their lives, coming together, trying to figure out the meaning of family while the rest of the 'verse messes with them.

I like the firefly show way better than BSG, but the BSG boardgame captures the heart of the show so much better (betrayal, co-operation, pressure, survival, resources ). 

For about the same amount of time 2-3 hours for both games, I much rather be playing BSG. In BSG you are at least somewhat involved in each others turns, in firefly it's just one big wait for your turn, then you do 2 things towards your missions of go here, do this, and get that, then you wait again.

RATING: 7
Pretty interesting take on pick-up and deliver, and seems to feel like it might scratch the same itch as Merchants of Venus. I'll need a few more plays before I can say if Firefly replaces Merchants, but Merchants sets the bar pretty darn high.

The flavor of Firefly the game is a perfect marriage of theme and mechanics. Gale Force Nine seems to hit the ball out of the park when it comes to IP games, and Firefly is a perfect example of this.

I'm looking forward to playing again and trying the various scenerios/game modes offered.

Licensed games are usually a disaster, but Firefly is an obvious exception. It's an excellent implementation of the show and it really makes you feel like you're living and working in that world. It's not a complicated game, but there is a lot going on, all of which serves to push the theme even further. Like Mage Knight, it suffers from very long play time and takes up an extremely large amount of space. Those are the two primary reasons why I don't play this game every week, but I certainly enjoy it enough to do so...if only I had someone else to set it up and we could break for a day halfway through. =)

I'd give it a higher score, but I was very disappointed with the size of the game box and quality/thickness of the many cards. The cards were very flimsy, so I sleeved them to give them  a bit more sturdiness/durability and even with the insert removed, only half the game now fits in the box.

This is a game that you don't necessarily need to know the theme to play, but might be essential in order to enjoy it.  The mechanics are mostly pick up and deliver, which fits the theme well -- but without the theme, it would seem quite dry.  I like that there are some open-endedness with the jobs, though, although the traveling is a bit much at times.  Even after all that, the theme is fun, and I would much rather play it over Merchant of Venus.

Overall I think the game does a great job of capturing the theme and feel of the show that it is based on.  Additionally the underlying mechanics are good for the type of game that it is.  I would change a couple of things with how acquiring crew/upgrades/tools works but otherwise it's a great foundation set of mechanics and rules to support the actual game which is the story cards.  Six come out of the box, but the formula is fairly straight forward so I would expect to see some quick small expansions to expand on this as well as fan created scenarios as well.

I don't care about firefly - but a lot of my friends do.  I want this game for them.  Apparently the gameplay is pretty good - I'd love to try it out.  Low on my list.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
Components - .9/1 Box is nice. Rules are disorganized. Easy to get up and running but provide troublesome when finding the corner cases. In game currency is by far the best I've seen in a game. It's so good, the rulebook disorganization doesn't cost this a tenth of a point. The board is well organized and the dice are nice (have a custom firefly icon on one side). The cards are standard, and the art is great. The ships are nice, except the Alliance Cruiser. The cruiser just seems cheap and flimsy. It doesn't stay on the stand well, it's warped, and looks cheap. To the contrary the Reaver's Cutter looks just like the film and the firefly's easily remind me of Serenity. 

Fun - .6/1 I'm trying to be objective with this. When looking for a game, this can easily drag into a long session of a snore fest. People have to actively be looking at things not on their turn, plotting/planning their next move. There is minimal interaction between players in the game. If you're not looking for a game for the sake of competition, but rather and experience, see my theme/personal rating. I do love this game, but as a game, I've found more fun in plenty others.

Replayability - .7/1 There are a set of several missions that come with the game and they are unique enough. Given the large number of card decks involved in playing (5 job decks, 5 supply decks, 2 movement decks and the misbehaving deck), even the same scenarios will have unique enough outcomes because the same strategy won't necessarily be available.

Strategic - .6/1 You can have a strategy, but you are at the mercy of the cards for quite a lot. At some point you balance getting every possible type of item/crew member/keyword with not waiting too long to accumulate said pieces so someone isn't too far ahead. A string of terrible cards in a row will put you in a hole and this isn't a forgiving game. Generally when you fall behind, you won't come back in it. It is worth noting the game doesn't eliminate players, but it doesn't really have any type of catch-up mechanism. I do still think strategy does play a part because a lot of it does boil down to risk/reward of running a slim/efficient ship (generally don't have enough to get to the end game) versus building a fully decked out ship (generally takes too long to complete).

Theme - 1/1 I'll prefix this with I love the show, I like the movie. It may make me have a bias, but I don't believe any game I've played has captured its theme so well. When I play this game, I feel like I'm a captain of my own Firefly in the 'verse. I find myself feeling like I can be doing everything right then fate slams a Reaver ship in my path and now I'm just scrambling to keep my crew alive. When I play this game, I do it for the experience because nothing feels like being in charge of a little transport/smuggling operation. Every time you go into space you've got a million things to worry about yet cannot do anything but hope you've got the necessary pieces to keep flying. 


Personal Rating - 3.5/5 I enjoy the game, but I feel like I can admit it is functionality lacking as a board game. If you strip out the theme, I think it ends up being a luck driven mediocre game. I think the theme is what makes this an awesome experience. When I play, rarely care whether I win or lose, I have a freaking fantastic time being the captain of a spaceship! Let alone a spaceship in a universe that I simply fell in love with in the show.

1 play, 5er, partial game (out of time; 3+ hours)

Kind of cool from the theme point of view, but WAY too random for me! One guy repeatedly got smacked by the Alliance cruiser -- seemingly every time he moved through the core worlds! The dice, the luck of the card draws, the way the jobs come out ... just too much randomness. And way WAY too long with 5!! We quit after 4 hours. If I ever play this again, likely stick to 2- or 3-player game!

Ever since acquiring Spartacus I have had my eye on Gale Force 9 and their foray into boardgames.  l love Spartacus and GF9 have another terrific game under their belt with Firefly.  The boardgame is very thematic, and its not pasted on, it oozes the TV series.  First class components and mechanics that make sense result in an entertaining pick up and deliver game that draws you into the verse.  As a bonus it is solitaire friendly.

RATING: 7
This is a pickup and deliver game set in the Firefly universe.  It feels very much like Merchant of Venus but with a lot of fan service for fans of the show (of which I am among their number).

In this game there is a global set of goals and the first player to complete all the goals is the winner.  The core of the gameplay is collecting equipment and crew for your space ship so you can better complete missions for more rewards with which to complete those goals or get more and better equipment and crew.  Like I said, very similar to Merchant of Venus right down to the science fiction theme.  I probably prefer Merchant of Venus because I feel like there is more to it but this is still a very rich and fun pickup and deliver game and like I said, as a fan of the series I love all the references and fan service in this game.

Since it is a race to the completion of a certain number of specific goals (rather than an end game point comparison for example) one flaw I can see in the game is, due to the random nature of most of the gameplay, lucky draws and better starts can give some players an unfair advantage.  The game knows this though and provides ways to alleviate that randomness.  When drawing cards from any deck you get to pick from not only the entire discard pile but can also draw up to three right off the top of the deck and choose from those.  This gives players a lot of options to find the best missions for them to accomplish their goals and even out the advantages some.

Like most pickup and deliver games though the scale of this one is huge.  There are over a dozen different decks of cards in the game and the footprint, setup, and tear down time is large plus it comes with a play time of about 1-1.5 hours per player depending on the scenario.  Also, despite how good it may be since that's all I hear people talk about with this game, the paper money is still annoying to deal with and I would probably almost always rather replace it with poker chips or ANYTHING else.

No doubt, thematically it is incredibly true to the show, this IS Firefly in a board game. And that is worth something, sadly, next to the enjoyment of design and the great, thematic ideas the game play itself falls short. Something exciting is missing here.
Pick-up-and-deliver, route planning, legal and illegal (and sometimes immoral) jobs, hiring crew and optimizing your ship - all of that should be fun but in the long, long run of the game boredom settles in. It can take very long to get to the next planet/ port, the cards and dice roll add too much randomness for me (though, that is sure not out of theme), while you wait for your next turn there is nothing to do since the game is really not that complex to make you plan and strategize while you wait, then there is really minimal player interaction. I usually enjoy solitary game play but here I was not invested and therefor bored. 
I was disappointed, and then shocked when I realized we were playing for 3 hours and no one was even close to tackling the first of the 3 group goals which you need to win the game. Even for a first game (where you do visit the rule book several times to clarify how things work) that is way, way too long for what this game delivers.
I think I am willing to give it another try but for now "Firefly - The Game" has been one of the bigger letdowns of late. 5 points that likely might fall lower...
Update: 5 points I raised a bit to 6. This will never be a favorite, it takes too long for my liking, there is waiting til your turn comes around again especially when people go through stack of cards to make a choice, but it can be enjoyable, I seem to really enjoy myself for the first 30 min, then it starts to drag.

Fun thematic Game. I can see expansions really helping expand some of the quest/story/shop decks.. There is not much player interaction, which is a shame, but otherwise it is a decent way to spend 2 hours. It is not something I would play weekly, but I would enjoy playing this game about once a month.

RATING: 3
Personally I like the theme, the material, the overall idea. But bellow this is a very simple pickup and delivery mechanism, which gets very broad with many rules, some attached stuff here and there, but it has hardly depth. Theoretically you could do a lot of planning, but practically that's pretty pointless, because in the end the event cards you draw and the dice you throw will determine what happens anyway... For this the game is just way to long and broad (but some friends of mine really like it).

A fantastic adventure game that allows you to jump into the verse and lose yourself in it. Firefly the game is everything a fan of the show could want it to be. The game is a bit to long though.

Gorramit! Sure to say that this can be a shiny shindig, but times will come when you got the notion that, wither it not the theme, you'd go jackrabbit at the sight of the ruttin luh suh wreck of a mudder minded piece of gosa. It'll do you for a spell, but it's got a powerful lacking of humor.

Great theme play.  Fairly easy to learn and easy to play.  Centerpiece of game is the pick-up & deliver mechanic. Only minor player interaction.  Components are excellent - mounted board, plastic playing pieces, thick chits, and somewhat durable cards.  Nice artwork, especially on the paper money.  The rulebook is OK, unclear on some rules and could be better organized.  Our first play was very long.

Interesting.  Seems to take longer than the estimate on the box, but, to be fair, it WAS our first game and we were still figuring it out.  The Messing Around cards (I think that's what they were called) can be brutal!  Not a bad game, and our play time will probably drop as familiarity rises.

I picked this game up because I had just started watching the show and I also discovered (by playing Black Fleet) that I like pick up and deliver games.  I wanted to give the solo play a try.  Loved the way the game looked and it came with a lot of stuff.  It just lacked any tension for me playing it solo.  I can see how having other players to race against would improve the game. 

I also didn't like the random nature of how the jobs needed to be completed by rolling dice.  

I think it is a good game...just not one for me to play solo.

I'm a big fan of The Firefly TV series and was looking forward to getting immersed in the Firefly world, but I was sadly disappointed with this game. It seems to take way too long to get any of the jobs that you can pick up done, plus the scenarios objects also take an age to do.
So this is another game that has gone into our collection of games to gather dust. (16/02/16)

Fifty pounds of theme in a five pound box. This is probably the best themed game I've ever encountered -- they did a wonderful job of capturing the feel of the show in a board game.

My only qualm for this game is that it's one of those games where the players are basically sitting together playing separate games of solitaire.  There is very little interaction, beyond being able to sic the Federation or Reavers on someone, or occasionally trading.  It appears the upcoming "Pirates and Bounty Hunters" expansion was designed to address this, as it specifically creates direct conflict between players.  Hopefully that will increase my rating to a 10.

Much larger UK box has more room for expansions. Same height as US edition, but half again as wide.

Took some time to get in to because of the not so clear rulebook. In fact it's a good solid space adventure game. Starting with a lot of pickup & delivery, ending with more challenges. 

Reminded me of a crossover between Relic, Runebound and Fortune and Glory - in space.

As in Relic, you traverse the void, and though you have more options, it is usually quite clear what to do on a given turn. As with Runebound, your hero (in this case, your ship) 'levels up' as you get more gear and crew to take on heftier jobs. But it reminded me the most of Fortune and Glory, as you encounter adventures and have to make skill tests. The mechanic that sets this game apart from F&G is in my opinion the 'choice' you have on your adventure cards. There is always an option, sometimes both bad, sometimes both good but you have more control. Therefore, it feels less random and 'sure whatever' as F&G.

Liked the game, disliked the frequent flipping back to the rulebook and some rules aren't even properly described (is captain part of your crew? If you have to kill crew, is that random or can you pick and choose, is a transport equipment that needs to be attached to a crew (presumably yes) and if so, is the BFG equipment that needs to be attached to a transport or a crew member to operate? etc). 

The movement mechanic is a bit wonky, with flipping over encounter cards for every step, but you get used to it pretty fast. All in all, liked the game, will stay in my collection and will definitely play it again.

First play was with 5.  And it took way way to long.  And one of our players got (I think) Jayne and Zoe (may have been Wash, regardless he had those three later) turn one, and proceeded to stomp every single misbehave attempt.  Would not recommend for more than three players due to the length of it.

Complaints aside, it's a real good implementation of the Firefly license.  Two thumbs up to gf9 for doing that.

So many characters. So many ships. So many planets. So much STUFF. And yet... not *too* much somehow. It all looks quite epic and grand, but when you actually sit down to play it Firefly manages to feel very manageable -- even to relatively green players. None of the expansions necessarily add anything too notable on their own but as an entire package the amount of choice is fantastic -- if not often rather excessive or unnecessary, but that's okay! The random elements seem to add to the replayability of the game and Firefly feels fun no matter how terribly you're personally doing.

I'm a Browncoat, but I'm not sure I want a fetch and carry game in my collection.

Now if there was some rational way to pickup all the promo cards, I may change my tune on that. And no, ordering 2+ copies of the game, buying an old issue of a magazine I've never heard of, and posting a picture of the game on Facebook with a kind of toy I got rid of almost twenty years ago is not jiving with me.

Come on, some one associated with this game can make all the Shinies easier to come by. 

EDIT: Now that there's an expansion out that forces more interaction and conflict I'm mulling over picking this up at some point. I still stand by my comment about the difficult Shinies.

RATING: 7.3
I'm not sure how well this will stand up to repeated plays as the theme, pushing your luck as you race around the 'verse and getting hilariously screwed by Reavers is entertaining but will perhaps lose a lot of its lustre by the fifth or sixth time it happens. Also, we went through almost all of the cards in every deck (except Reaver space) in our first play, so we have basically seen everything already.

The cards all seem to make sense based on the characters they are and there are some interesting if light decision making spaces here.

Played quickly this took 2 hours for the first scenario (3 players) which felt very slightly too long but I suspect we over staffed our ships and bought too much having been beaten down by some early misbehaving cards.

There's a lot of promise here and the game is much better than I'd feared. I just don't know how many plays I will get out of it.

The only concern I have is the repetitive nature of the game.  It's very, very thematic, but as you get further into the game, I found myself thinking that it was just...the same thing over and over.

Even though, that we prefer Euros over Ameritrash games this one was a surprising hit for us. We were not that immersed by the theme to begin with - we had some vague recollection of the plot of Serenity, but was not big fans of the "browncoat world". Notably, we love sci-fi, so the theme was still a draw for us. This is a typical lazy Sunday afternoon board game where you can travel the universe, do different jobs and go through adventures which come with them. The idea, that the journey is more important than the destination perfectly applies to this game. According to our experience until the 70-80% of the game nobody really pursues the goals of the current plot, instead they enjoy flying through space visiting different planets, recruiting crew, and purchasing gear to them. In our opinion the Pirates and Bounty Hunters expansion is a must have - it does not only provide extra ships and side-objectives to the game, but more PvP as well. That expansion elevated the game from something which we liked to one which we love. It plays really well with 2 players, but perhaps 3 and 4 are the sweet spot for the game. With more than that it can take even more time to play - we had a four hours session with 5 players the other day. This is our major con against the game - the time it takes to play sometimes keeps it away from the table.
P.s.: After playing the game several times we were encouraged to rewatch the series. Our admiration of the design was augmented by the experience - even the smallest roles from the show are cleverly integrated in the game.

Rating based on first two-ship solo play of the game, with the Breaking Atmo expansion.

The game seemed very much like 2-player solitaire, and there wasn't much happening. Kind of boring actually.

Even while just learning the rules, playing the King of Londoninium story card - there's no way this could be done is 2 hours! Too much $$ required I think, to be done in that time frame.

Looking forward to the new expansion, to see if it helps. I hope so.

RATING: 6
Not so shiny. The same tired roll/skill-check mechanics (with one d6, so no curve), with way too many special rules and cases (and traps for beginners) to learn easily--often explained only in the rulebook. Only three skills, but a very large number of special character traits, and gadgets, so eventually you have to run around the 'Verse collecting everything possible to be able to survive random encounters (Fox, not Josh), eroding your crew and equipment, so you have to run around again. Also, you have to learn, what and where are which cards?

Firefly movement is tedious. For usually five steps: step; draw; and maybe a quarter of the time, encounter. Nearly all encounters have two options--while nice so you don't have to be an expert in all skills (or have all equipment) it slows the game. But after a couple encounters--"Wait! Where was I going?" Since evading the  Reavers or the Alliance stops your movement, in a four player game, the chances of another player being able to drop them right back on top of you is pretty high. And most of the goals are on the opposite side of the gorram 'Verse (3-4 moves).

While my initial impression of the game was very good, the same old mechanics get old fast. The goals seem too hard for quick play: why four successive random encounters? The more or better crew you have, the less you make from each job. Estimate one hour per player, for experienced players; double for new players unless everyone has read the rules, FAQ, and cheat sheets. Some parts of cards are a bit low contrast.

RATING: 7
For me this game is very similar to Battlestar Galactica, in that both games can drag on for a long and unecessary amount of time.  However, I feel like in BSG there are often times things you simply can't do, no where for you to go, like when you are put in the brig.  In Firefly there always seems to be some exciting mission or THE REAVERS drawn when you least want or expect it.  This being said, I still don't feel like this game needed to have as large a map or go on for as long as it did, I would like to see a simpler version of this.  When you play 2+ hour games they better be AMAZING (rebellion) otherwise, I am sorry, I generally am quite critical, still given the choice between BSG and this I would take this any day.

I really really want to like this but after 3 hours of bad luck based suffering I can't yet.

Depressing.

RATING: 9
Overall this is a fun, very thematic game. If you have not watched Firefly or do not enjoy it, then you will not get the most from this game. On the other hand if you are a fan of the show then you should enjoy this.

At its heart this is a pickup and deliver game, but the combination of theme mixed with the mechanics just makes the game shine. If you know you are going through Alliance space then there is a reasonable chance of an inspection - that's really annoying if you happen to be doing something illegal. But if you are in Border Space and the Reavers come by ... Reavers man! It's terrifying.

The game is not very hard or complicated and a 10yo can play with a little bit of early assistance. The challenge will be the game length - this is a game for rainy afternoon when you want to burn a fun couple of hours.

However for short family fun you can easily house rule it. e.g.
 - When doing a scenario, just do 1 task instead of multiple tasks.
 - Start with a bit more money all around (or give the younger players a money advantage)
 - Don't give younger players warrants, or kill their crew.
 - Don't attack younger players
 - Tone down the effects Reavers have on younger players or give them "Reaver Cloaks".

Game like is too long, but game length for Firefly is just right!  Played a couple of 2 player games.  Indeed, they're long.  I started with the downloadable "new" start card.  

My wife thinks it's perfect.  She only likes what she calls "dripping" games and this is one of them.  For Firefly gamers this is a must.  For others, I dropped 0.5 points off the score cause, well, it just so much fun if you know the characters, speak and atmosphere.  

Gale Force 9 has truly lived up to their promise.  I was very skeptical when I first read about this Firefly game.  This one is going to be on want lists for a long long time.

Major gripe:  The inner box split open on the side in shipping.  It is being replaced by Miniature Market as we speak.  Thanks Miniature Market!

For once, "dripping with theme" is not an overstatement! This is basically just a multiplayer solitaire, pick-up-and-deliver game - but a very well done and produced one at that, and each aspect of the game supports the (great) theme brilliantly. For those not familiar with the series, it's probably nothing spectacular, though still an OK game. Word of warning: Requires a LOT of table space!

RATING: 7.5
A fun, thematic pick-up-and-deliver / adventure game that's reminiscent of [i]Merchant of Venus[/i] and [i]Merchants & Marauders[/i].  I like games that weave a cohesive narrative and this one definitely does that.

My favourite aspect is the ever-present threat of encountering the Alliance and Reaver ships.  The Reavers especially can be devastating.  My first game, the Reavers raped, ate, and utilized the skin of 10 passengers and 2 of my crew JUST before I reached their destination.  A spectacular failure, that job.

I've read complaints that the game can run long but I have yet to experience that.

UPDATE: (Some of) the expansions have made a good game better.  Though this game is now as bloated as [i]Arkham Horror[/i], and that's quite the accomplishment.

One of the best themed games around. It's rather simple "pick up, drop off" space transport game with a really nice 'misbehave' mechanic that paces the game and lets upgrades be useful. This deck contains the challenges that need to be passed to complete the jobs. You can choose from two options that may require an item or crew member, or a check from 1 of three attributes: fight, talk, or tech.

RATING: 6
Difficult for me to rate this. Thematically, it's spot on. You absolutely feel as if you are in the Firefly universe. As a big Firefly fan, this was a pleasant surprise, since many other TV or movie themed games often feel like the theme was simply slapped on for marketing purposes only. However, there's so little player interaction, it's like a bunch of people playing solitaire next to each other. We played several games with anywhere between 2 to 4 players anywhere and it felt the same  no matter what. Maybe the expansions fix that problem, but the base game shouldn't have had that issue to begin with. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Highly dependent on theme, very convoluted by an excessive amount of card-drawing, and not as interactive with other players as to make it competitive and enjoyable - even with the Pirates and Bounty Hunters expansion, which essentially becomes an arms race in conjunction with your fetch-quest scavenger hunt.

RATING: 7
One of those games where I feel like there is nothing wrong, or at least nothing I would really change but it also isn't a perfect game.

It fits the theme very well which most GF9 games seem to do.  But the turns are a bit long, the table is a mess and it doesn't quite live up to the epic expectations you have at the outset.  It's also a very long game, 2-3 hours or more in most cases if you play the full game.

That said if you get a few fans of the show together I could see playing this a few times a year and having fun with it.

Lots of fun with friends, it's really easy to chew through 4 hours without even realizing it.  Between the missions, trading, dealing with reavers, customizing your ship and crew and just keeping your Firefly running, there is so much to do.  What kind of strategy do you use?  Do the tough stuff first and hope for the best and the big score, or do you play it safe and slowly save up your money?  This game has dozens of ways to play and hundreds of ways to set up your crew and ship.  If you're a fan of the show this is a must have, if you're not, then this game is still a lot of fun.  Just be prepared for a lot of set up and tear down, this game has a lot of components and cards you don't want to get mixed up or lost.

[thing=138161][/thing] is a game in which the main actions are: move (spending fuel or not), buy equipament, fuel or parts for the ship, hire crew, search for jobs and fulfilling them in order to gain gain money and became solid with the contractor - trade and/or sudden but inevitable betrayal of disgruntled crew is possible when sharing a space with another player's ship.

In the moviments is possible to move 1 space, without hiccups or move, with the initial engine, up to 5 spaces, by spending 1 fuel. But, when travelling this way, for every space, a Full Burn card (event) will be revealed - most of them will be for nothing happens, others to move the Alliance ship (in the main quadrant) or the Reavers (in the outer rim systems), and, sometimes, a proper bump in the space, when the players will have to make a choice (normally to stop to avoid a bad thing or to gain something; or to continue, but losing the chance of getting the something or at a risk (a test) or cost (spending fuel, parts, making the crew unhappy, etc).

The jobs taken can be legal, as to take cargo or passangers from one place to another; illegal, as smuggling goods or help fugitives to escape; or crime jobs, which are done on the spot (the others require going from A to B), but are unpredictable, requiring the capitain and crew to do some misbehavin', which is revealing cards from the Misbehavave deck, that represents the unforeseeability of this sort of job (sometimes is required to fight your way out, to talk your way out, run like hell, and so on). For the crime jobs is best to go well prepared, with equipaments and a good crew, otherwise failure will follow shortly. The jobs that doesn't require misbehaving can be done with, normally, very little.

The players can choose their ship (at first, all are equal, only the name is different) and the Captain (these are indeed different, with some important unique abilities). After this, the Fireflies will be going around the system back and forth, stopping in key spots to do some business (buying, selling or looking for jobs). This is the basic game.

[thing=138161][/thing] works around scenarios. In the first, to learn things, the requirements are: 1) Be solid with 2 persons; 2) Have $6000 in the pocket; 3) Go to Ezra planet (where Niska lives). Done, this is it. The winner will be the first to fulfill the three objectives. Other scenarios change the requirements heavily, as expected. 

Now, onto the two most important things:

[b]Theme:[/b] It is there. Really there. From the language to the personalities to the places. For those that like the series, the ovearll story of Firefly is there. But is a grandiose scope. Firefly, the series, revolve around jobs, sure, but mostly is about people, the crew (mainly) and also in the people they trade, cheat, fight, talk, help, etc. In [thing=138161][/thing] is all about the jobs. They have thematic names, but in the end, people focus on take X on A and take it to B. I haven't see someone actually mentioning what the job really was, only what the needs of it were. This is a little of a bummer, however, I can't see a way to make the game as is more thematic than it already is. But I would be totally down for a [thing=34119][/thing] set in the 'Verse.

[b]Luck:[/b] This is the part of the game that can make even hardcore fans of the series turn their noses at it. Because there are a fine lot of luck in [thing=138161][/thing]. First, the events drawn are completely random: one player can cross a system without a problem, while you, needing to advance 2 spots, get hit bad twice; and this is also true for the Misbehave deck. Mind you that, in both situations, players can and must prepare as well as possible to deal with the occurrences thrown at them by the game. Still, you can be pretty well in the firepower and mechanical departments, only to be required a roll of the social skill of your crew. And, of course, say you did have a level for social tests, a 4, and is trying to beat the required number of 7, you will fail with 1 or 2; while someone else, with 1 in social skill, can roll a 6 and pass. There is simply no way of knowing what the Misbehave deck will ask of you - for the travelling events, at least most of them revolves around fuel and ship parts. The counterpoint is that the players know ahead of time that the Misbehave deck is a wild thing, and to keep and accept a job that requires misbehavin' is a player choice. Also, when buying equipaments, hiring crew and accepting contracts, there are open cards, which the player can look at, and is also possible to take facedown cards - so the player can know beforehand some of the available cards, and can also, if not is of interest, to push the luck on the blind draw.

A side note: the graphic design of [thing=138161][/thing] is, well, uneven for me. I don't like cards that have stills of series or movies - I prefer drawn art. So, the game could be a total miss, if wasn't for the [b]amazing[/b] art on the back of the cards and on the paper money card. 

[thing=138161][/thing] proved itself, to me, as the sort of game in the area of "play for fun". Yes, you can (not mandatory, but highly recommended) fun in any game, but there are those you play to challenge yourself, your mind, your dexterity, your wuick wits, your decision making under pressure, whatever. And there are those you should play just for the fun. To burn fuel on space, to dodge the Alliance while carrying loads of illegal goods, and drop them in the hands of a solid partner of yours. A game to load explosives and buy pretty dresses; to be bold and have flair for danger.

In other words: to aim to misbehave.

RATING: 3
I like the interactions with planets and picking up crew and equipment.  The missions are somewhat challenging, but that is partially due to the vast distances that need to be traveled to do anything.  And here is where the problem begins...

All of Firefly's mechanics are time consuming, making games take far too long considering the depth of play.  If expansions were released with a priority to speed things up so that game length was no longer than 90 minutes at five players, then I might not dislike it so much, but would still rather play something else. 

This one might be better as an app.

The listed two-hour play time is a serious misnomer. However, the game is great. I love it and the theme just makes this Runebound-in-space game awesome. Yes, it is an adventure game in space. Yes, it doesn't have much direct-player conflict in it. Yes, that can boil down to a race game. All those points said, I have a kicking good time on the run. The main Serenity crew is awesome but there are enough second tier characters that you can make a great go at it if you aren't able to score the 'main' characters. It's fun and the rounds are quick paced so I am loving it.

not bad, but it did not wow me; however this was my first game of it, so I will reserve further judgement after more plays; so far, it reminds of an Ameritrash version of Merchants of Venus (which I feel plays more Euroish) - and as such, it has wilder swings of fortune in a way that I find a lot of Ameritrash games tend to have; the Reavers in the game are brutal; also you can try some really wild pushes of luck to get ahead in this game at times from certain illegal missions; in this game I mainly found myself constantly deciding whether to rush to my mission destination and risk running into bad luck, or slowly get to my mission destination and risk wasting time and falling behind the other players in points (money)

edit 2015-04-20: After more plays, especially solo and two player modes, this game has grown on me and the theme.  I enjoy playing it more often as a result.  Raised my rating from a 6 to a 7.

I've never seen such a horrible game as this one. It takes about 3 hours to finish it and every second of it is just a real torture... I don't want to play a 3 hours game with a simple pick up and deliver mechanism.
The downtime is HUGE in this game and it is absolutely NOT interesting to watch another player's turn... you just feel absolutely bored between your turns.
I actually played it more than once and in one game, we didn't even noticed that someone was winning. The winner itself didn't even notice... it was just like "oh... I won" and noone really cared, in fact everyone was just released that the game ended.
I have no clue how this game is ranked that high... I wouldn't even put it in the top 10'000 games.
If you like this kind of games, I would rather recommend World of Yo-Ho

Unfortunately ameritrash, where you random some things to see what your options are, then random some more to see if you succeed.  

All the value in the game comes from being "oh, I've got *crew member i liked from the show* on my ship!", "oh, i remember that quote, wasn't that quote good?", and none comes from the actual gameplay.  Which is the same way licenses versions of monopoly sell.

I want to like this more. The big downside for me is that the end of the game can really peter out. Spending several turns failing at missions and depleting resources at the end took its toll. We were all just hoping someone, anyone, would succeed so that we could pack it up. Maybe a few more plays will help it out, but it feels overlong and dissatisfying at the end.

Wow. Somehow I had the idea that this game wasn't too good (I was probably confused with stories I heard about the Serenity roleplaying system). Finally took the gamble, and the first playthrough was brilliant. 

First few round were a bit tedious (due to having to learn the game), and it seemed the game would go on for ages. However, after a bunch of rounds things speed up (both because we learnt how to play and because of capabilities of players) and the game was very, very enjoyable. 

Already planning to get a bunch of expansions.

RATING: 5.2
Too much random bullshit, honestly. It does the Firefly theme really well, but this just isn't a good game. No matter how big your crew is, or how many weapons, clothes, and ship upgrades you have, there are just times where you're just fucked and lesser prepared players get through right away because they got a better set of Misbehavin' cards. The only thing holding this thing together is our love for the Firefly franchise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme is amazing, and it truly captures that "Firefly" feel. With expansions, this game could probably shine, but I'm not sure it's worth the investment. It's already a large game as it is, anyway. The clunky movement and multiplayer-solitaire aspects make it a hard game to get to the table anymore, even with other Firefly fans. Traded for something more likely to get to the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
While I like all of the cards from a replayability perspective...they are a little bit of a pain to manage on the table.  Didn't care for the card-flipping for every space moved. Felt a bit un-wieldy.  Over-all, Game was fun, but a little long (3+hr) for what it was (but it was our first play). I'd like to give it a few more shots to bring that playtime down hopefully to under 2hr.  

Overall, the thematic flavor of the characters ROCKED...the movement felt like a Slog... I Enjoyed the game, but not sure I need to own it.  

I'm hoping Xia will scratch a similar Itch (only BETTER!)  I'm not in any hurry to acquire this, but I'll gladly play it.

RATING: 7
Really pleased with this game. This is a really solid game system which creates an enjoyable narrative adventure. Gameplay is reminiscent of Talisman's move, flip a card, roll a dice rhythm of play but with much more freedom.

Component quality is good although I prefer artwork to cast photos which can make it look a bit cheap. The artwork which is included on the supply decks etc is great and very atmospheric. Rulebook was ok, could have been clearer and this carries into the gameplay which can feel a bit loose at times.

The game is hugely thematic, really captures the feel of the show's space-pirates-come-wagon-train adventuring. Nevertheless, I think the game would stand up perfectly well without the license. Fans will not be disappointed.

Played this at GenCon 2013 right out of the box in the Board Game library.  It took about three hours for four of us to learn it and play a few rounds but we were far from finishing when we had to quit and go to our next session.  Three of us were fans of the show and thought the game did an excellent job of bringing the feel of the show into the game.  The fourth player had never seen the show, but he enjoyed the game as well.  I would agree with other posters that there is little player interaction and it seemed very random whether a particular player would complete a "job" or not.  I'm going to hold off on buying this until I see whether or not the first expansion increases player interaction. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Gameplay is mostly funneled through bland skill checks that are the standard "roll a die with some modifiers and see if you pass" variety.  It's also long -- plan for about 45 minutes per player, with very little interaction.  There's a high amount of variability in what you can buy, what quests you can take, how far you can travel, and what kind of cargo you can carry.  This isn't inherently a bad thing, but there are very few ways to mitigate bad draws, and that IS a bad thing.  

Didn't get what you wanted from the store?  Spend another turn.  Didn't pass the quest?  Spend another turn.  Couldn't fly far enough?  Spend another turn.  You know what's not fun?  Race games in which you frequently lose turns.  Pray you don't lose several in a row, or you will get intimately familiar with frustration.  

Lots of card draws and call-outs to familiar names, objects, and places is probably enough to satisfy fans of the show, but for players like me without that connection, it's quite dry.   The whole package has a staid game-plays-you feeling, as you continually draw a card and see what happens.  Throw in a rich-get-richer effect, and you have a real clunky game.  If you're looking for a better space merchant game, grab a copy of [gameid=131646].  If you're looking for a game based on a sci-fi show, go for [gameid=37111].

Probably the game's best trait is that it is so non-interactive that it is quite easy to drop out at any time, allowing you to go home and do something important like clip your toenails.

It often reminds me of an old game "https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110/auf-achse" and thanks to very accurate 'Verse portrayal every Firefly fan rejoices. With all the expansions and especially custom mods and story cards you can point the gameplay into any direction you want (pvp, coop, roleplay) so no two games are the same.

Yes! They made a Firefly game that is actually good. I will admit, for a primarily euro gamer that I am, the game mechanics is a little bland sometimes, but the theme shines through in everything that you do. I like because it is also a very nice risk-reward system in the game, and it is really about being as efficient as possible to do what you want to do. Takes a whole lot of table space though, but is an awesome looker once you set it all up.

Very thematic!  Initially it felt like there was a lot to keep track of and the rules felt a bit bumpy in places, but it all started to flow more smoothly once we got into the game.  

Update:  I still enjoy playing this, but there are some elements that seem to set people back so much that the game starts to drag or just plain throw you out of the running to win the game.

RATING: 7
I waited a long time for this one and overall I'm not disappointed. It's a pick-up and deliver game, with a heavy dose of push of your luck...which is right at home in a setting that is themed more or less around smuggling and tight time tables. It runs a little bit long, but I think once players are comfortable running simultaneous turns (which the rule book encourages you to do) the length will drop considerably. Like GF9's other game Spartacus, all of the game's mechanisms are extremely simple but work together very well to bring the theme to life.

The most concise way to describe it is Merchant of Venus light, although there are a few differences. Firefly is more character driven and the misbehavin' encounter deck gives a better story arc to the game, allowing it to touch on the adventure game genre a little bit. Adding this little slice of Arkham Horror to the mix makes all the difference to me. It lets the characters and other game play elements take on more unique personalities, rather than the generic faceless pilot you get in MoV.

I am going to be careful not to overplay it though. There are only 25 cards or so in each market deck, (which to be fair is still quite a lot of cards considering just how many decks there are), so knowing exactly what you are going to see each game might get repetitive. In a Euro strategy game, predictability is good, in a thematic romp not so much. I don't think this is going to be a problem for long, since there are 8 or 9 game expansions coming down the line.

My honest opinion is that based strictly on its gameplay  I rate this about a 6, slightly better than I feel about Merchant of Venus. They did a really nice job of hitting all the beats of the show and sprinkling in plenty of offbeat references for the Browncoats, so my enjoyment of the game is a bit higher than that.

I firmly believe this game will hold little appeal to people not familiar with Firefly... however I have yet to play with any non-fans, so we'll see!

First of all this game gets a special mention right off the bat for being incredibly eye-catching. Every little component and card is a work of art. It's nice just to have it sitting on the shelf.

That being said, this game takes up an INSANE amount of space! And time! This is primarily what puts this game into a 7 rating territory for me, rather than an 8. You have to be willing to commit some serious time to this one.

They really nail the theme - once gears get turning, you really get the feeling of "just getting by" and being all alone out in the 'verse. Almost every card in the game is sure to bring a smirk to your face if you're a fan of the show.

While at first I wanted to hate this game, I've actually come to really appreciate it. It is a shining example of well-executed theme and Firefly fans will absolutely enjoy that aspect of it. The game play is also surprisingly straight-forward and allows the player an open sandbox to pursue their own strategies. I also like that the game includes variable scenarios to keep the game interesting.

Highly recommended as an "adventure/experience" type of game. Lots of fun.

[GAMEID=147736] - 18-01-2014
Also including [GAMEID=151953], [GAMEID=159651] and [GAMEID=179014]

I'm a Firefly (and Serenity) fan, and so thematically i like this game; it's full of the places and events from the series. I also like the mechanics involved, so this is a good game in my opinion.

What I think it needs is a little more variation in the missions (but hey, that's what expansions are for) and a faster start-up; the first few turns are dedicated to getting your crew together. I'm putting serious thought into creating some "starter crew" cards that let everyone start on the same level. 

The Big Damn Heroes expansion can also unbalance the game if you let one player get hold of more than one or two of them, as they add money that wouldn't otherwise be there. I'm working on a drafting system to basically give each player one of them at the beginning of the game, which may prevent the imbalance unless they're stolen away while disgruntled.

With those additions, I might raise my rating...

I had high hopes for this game - obviously too high.

It turned out to be boring, clunky, barely engaging, and took significantly longer to play with multiple players than indicated on the box.

I plan to play it again one day (not any time soon) considering the money I spent on it, hoping maybe I was playing something wrong and that it will actually turn out to be a great game. I think I still have my hopes a little too high, and it will probably still just end up a waste of space on my shelf.

RATING: 8
Feels like you're flying through the 'Verse.  It's fun to upgrade your crews and ships.  Only real issue was the time it takes if people get lost in upgrades and the fact that you don't interact with other players during the game.  Neither are huge knocks for me, though.

RATING: 6.8
I wanted to like this more. It's not a bad game, but it's not exactly exciting. The gameplay is not cooperative nor is it really competitive. Much like the show you kind of just mosey through space. Each player just ships passing through the night. The pay off will really only be there for Firefly fans and even then it's thin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I had five too many turns where I went one space and collected $200.* On the plus side, 'moseying' is an actual game term.

If I played again (unlikely), my rating would probably decrease - particularly if (a) more than three players were involved or (b) we played the full game to completion.


*Wow, that almost sounds like a game of Monopoly.  Not a flattering comparison.

This game is a lot of fun and it kind of makes you feel like you're a pilot just trying to make their way in the 'verse.  There's a bit of a learning curve for non-board game geeks, so occasionally the time estimates on the scenarios can be way low.  I had one game take twice as long as the card said, simply because the game was too complicated for a couple players to learn quickly.

It's a lot of fun, and I really want to try some expansions.

Dripping with the theme of the too-soon canceled show, Firefly: The Game has what every Browncoat in the in the goram Verse wants, to keep flying.

The games will run longer than 2 hours.  So don't expect a short game.  And the first session, you may feel like it's too tough.  But that's probably because you're rushing to do harder jobs than your crew can handle.

A good, solid game that is well-deserving of the Firefly brand.

RATING: 7.09
It is a surprisingly interesting game. Not only it paints theme all over its rules and components, but it can also really appeal to a broad variety of players. There is rivalry to hire crew or buy items known to all players at the same time, one needs to manage his choice of jobs depending on his available resources, one needs to manage a budget to make sure that he keeps flying, working and paying his crew. That is strategy on a large scale, where a smart combination of all those aspects helps to win the game.
The objectives of each game is defined by the story chosen at the start and the first player meeting them wins. How to do it is up to the players but they are always reachable. A player may be slowed but cannot be eliminated. Twists and fate may well tip the scales the other way.

I played a complete game of this at SPIEL 2014, and fell in love. This is pure thematic gold. I'm a huge fan of Gale Force Nine's line of licensed board games. The more I play this game, the more I appreciate it.

The game has incredible replay value with a grand total of eight Setup Cards, and 21 Story Cards. Some, like The Blitz Setup Card allow for much quicker play, while The Browncoat Way helps balance the many various ships, and make selecting a ship or a captain first a real hard choice. Combining these, and other, Setup Cards with the many Story Cards make for one hell of a customizable game. You can play complete matches in anything from one hour to many hours of epic play with a full table of six players, and a longer scenario.

Overall dissapointing.  I love the show and the theme!  The chrome is amazing.  The mechanics feel like they should work but...

If you play with someone who has AP this game drags.  Boredom sets in between rounds and anger flares when the Stegosaurus isn't passed along fluidly.  Also the luck and random getting screwed thing is hard to take.  4 of us played a game starting at 6pm.  2 of us knew the game, at 11:30pm nobody completed the 1st of 3 objectives and I ran out of money throwing myself at the 1st one repeatedly until my captain retired/commited suicide/went insane.  

I played this once before at KublaCon and we played with the expansion that let one ahole steal from our ships just before we could cash in on objectives.  Not fun then.  I will try it out with a different audience, it's becoming like BSG for me-unplayable.

I really love this pick up and deliver game!
Being a fan of the TV show, the theme really comes through and you feel like you are traveling the 'Verse to complete any kind of job. Letting the theme aside, the game is quite good with lots of interesting decisions and possibility to personalize your ship. Obviously, the luck aspect sometimes can be annoying, but you can always mitigate that if you come prepared. Components are really good, but it takes a lot of space to play it and some time to set it up.
Looking forward to playing it again, possibly with more players to increase the interaction with the NPC ships.

The theme is definately firefly, but the game is basically a race which feels semi luck based. Setup is tedious due to the need to shuffle 12 decks of cards (in base game alone - expansion adds MORE!).

Good for fans of the show and series. Good for casuals who like to come to a pre-setup board (e.g.: setup happens at the host's place before players arrive) but itself is not a casual game.

Some interaction does exist, but for the most part you are playing solitare with a group of solitare players.

Negative aspect is that it takes too long for most casual players but that never bothered me.

Too much random. Simply getting stuff from the show and make them to random cards does not a good game make.

There's nothing in the game really forcing the pace, so many players can easily end up in a 1 step forward, 1 step back sort of rut. If everyone ends up in that rut, the game will likely go on far longer than it should. A bit long and loose.

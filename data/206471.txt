Think of a trick-taker in which winning as many tricks as you bid - no more and no less - is the critical thing.  Now imagine that the trump suit can be changed in the course of a hand.  Utter chaos, right?  Eternity proposes an answer in that you can also make your bid and raise it in the course of the hand.  The snag is that you have to "pledge" a card, not competing for a trick, in order to do so. Only one player is allowed to do this per trick and it can't be the player who leads to the trick.  So opportunities to pledge are relatively scarce.  You will need to gamble - and did I mention that the trump suit can change unpredictably?

Eternity is almost a very good game.  The fact that pledged cards may both increase your bid and change the trump suit (or edge towards it) leads to some tough decisions.  Naturally, the cards that increase your bid the most are also those likeliest to win tricks.  However, for my taste there is a touch too much chaos.  

Production quality is decent.  The psychedelic artwork is striking.  The English rules are well written and clear.

Trick taking game which got better the more we played it. At fist it seemed a bit underwhelming, but as the game end was near, we all wanted to play it again. Rating would probably go up after a few more plays.

RATING: 8
3 plays. Strange rating. I think this is best with 3 or 4. With 5. it is fairly random as trump can change very quickly in unpredictable ways due to 2 people being able to pledge. Also with 5 players it can be very difficult to get one more trick needed to take the lead as there is  a lot of competition for each trick (though that 2nd point might be actually a plus). Last round dominates, and previous rounds largely serve to give an advantage to the player who wins them,, but the final round bonus points are so large that people always have hope.  Extremely well designed game.

Clever trick-taking game with shifting trump.  You pledge for the number of tricks you plan to take throughout the hand and one of the impacts of the pledge cards is that they can shift trump.   Big rewards for matching your bid exactly, with commensurate penalties for coming up short.

This game is for all the trick-tacking nerds out there. It has a prediction element similar to a lot of trick-tacking games such as: [thing=8129]Die Sieben Siegel[/thing], [thing=1116][/thing], [thing=6688][/thing], and [thing=1465][/thing]. Here you have to predict your winners while playing out the hand, which may mean predicting them after they've happened. Cards can be played into the trick or one person (two in the 5p game) per trick can play a card sideways to gain 0-2 tokens. If paired with a won trick at the end of the hand you get 1VP per token (unless you promised more tricks than you won, in which case you get nothing).

The real point though is to have the exact same number of tokens as won tricks. If you do that you get a bonus. The bonus is extremely important. If you miss out on one you will almost certainly lose. 

The other somewhat unique aspect is that cards played sideways go into a display in the middle of the table. Whichever suit has more cards in the display is trump. Ties are broken with a suit hierarchy which is randomized each game (for no apparent reason). Depending on your hand you may want to attempt to make a particular suit trump, or it might just happen for no reason and you're trapped with some powerful cards... oopsies!

I enjoy playing trick-tacking games. This one is worth playing. It has some fun twists to noodle around. I don't love it though. I only played at 5p and I think the game is worse (more chaotic) at that number. I would like to try a few games at 4p.

RATING: 6
FIRST IMPRESSION:

Trick taker where the trump is determined in game and can change in the midst of a game as people pledge cards to gain trees. Trees are placed on tricks taken to score points. So, one basically seeks to predict what one takes. Not certain if I like the rising value in reaching harmony through the three rounds of the game but that's easily house ruled.

Excellent take on tricktaking with a very interesting twist. Still simple and quick. Quite an addicting game. Win tricks, but win trees as well, otherwise you don't score any points. Trump can be influenced during the game. Well, it's a very smart system, recommended. check out this game.

A trick taker with an interesting twist: make your predictions for the hand during the hand. This has the side effect of influencing trump, which is perhaps less interesting. I'd certainly play again.

Fun and rather interesting trick taking game, but a lot of luck involved, with tiny differences between success and fail and therefore hard to make a comeback.

This one has been getting a lot of praise, but I found it to be just okay. The main draw here is that the trump suit can change multiple times within the round, and you have the option of donating a card towards doing that if you don't feel like you can win the current trick. This has been seen before, so unless you dig the artwork, there's nothing that original here. The scoring of growing trees on tricks taken is kind of cool, I guess, but I felt like it was more of a chore than an interesting feature of the game.

Decent trick taking game.  The idea of a changing trump suit is interesting to me as well as trying to pair up the tokens to your tricks.  I played it with three, but it feels like it should be played with 4 or 5 to really get into the game play.  Sold at DTC 2017.

Based on one play: Simple trick taking mechanics with two minor modifications. You can play cards on the side to gain tokens that give value to the tricks you won and those cards determine which suit is trump. The art is really nice and the game play is fairly fun, mostly you are trying to win the exact amount of tricks that you have tokens for, so there is a little push your luck aspect.

This is a great wizard-killer. You're trying to balance getting tricks and pledging. Pledging is something one person can do per trick. You basically retreat from a trick and play any card in front of you, receiving tokens in the process. This can change the trump for the next round. These tokens are important, because without them you can't score. Get too much and score nothing, get too few and score little, get the perfect amount and get bonus points.

Trick-taking amazingness. Mind bending since the trump could change at any moment. It is just crazy how the turns work out. Try and collect trees to score the tricks you claim- but there has to be a balance. Really hard! Only played with 3p and I can't wait to play with 4 players. It is a stunning game and simple to learn and tricky to do well. I really enjoyed my time playing and very happy to own it.

A bit too tactical for my tastes.

Feels similar to those games where you have to predict exactly how many tricks you can win in a round.

Players have more "tools" than your trick taking game, namely discarding *any* card off to the side which affects will be trump. Discarding higher cards win you more special tokens that enable you to score tricks you won. Too many of these tokens gives you a score of zero for the hand. Taking advantage of this discarding mechanic is one key to winning this game.

Interestingly, there are only three suits, which makes it harder to void suits, which in turn makes it hard to play trump cards. 

What I love about traditional trick taking games is the deductive play necessary to  discover what your opponents hold and thus taking advantage of this information. This game is more about planning what you can and can't do with your hand, and hoping opponents don't get in the way.

Must try with less than five.

[Blackrock Games 2016 edition] {Fantasy; trick-taking; optimal 4p} The twist of this trick-taking game is about the changing trump suit in a hand.  Players can choose to skip a trick by pledging cards which can manipulate the trump suit of the next trick.

Another fun part is about the Tree Tokens.  Basically, players have to predict how many tricks they can win in a hand by collecting Tree Tokens when they are pledging cards.  Each hand is played similarly except that the harmony bonus increases each hand (2, 4, 7 points respectively).

In all, this game looks fun and interactive.  I am looking forward to play it.

It is easy to teach, learn and set up the game.  I don't use the score sheet.

The card illustration is artistic, though not my taste.  Everything is nicely produced.  Good production.

RATING: 3
Really one of the worst trick-taking games I've played, and I'm a big fan of the genre.

The scoring in the standard three-round game is problematic. The first round is ultimately meaningless and the second round is also largely meaningless considering the amount of points you can get in the third round. Granted, the alternate scoring rules seem to address this. But then you've just got a boring, low-scoring trick-taking game.

The game is also too chaotic and luck dependent because of the way trump can change during a round. Chaotic and luck dependent aren't things you want in a trick-taking game.

I've seen several comments that say this is a Wizard killer. While Wizard is certainly not one of the better trick-taking games, it is a better game than Eternity. This one's just not good and no fun.

Sold.

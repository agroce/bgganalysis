It is a great tactical ops game. The best part of this game is assembling the best team with all the resources you have for the mission, but the gameplay is somehow simple and with a lot of game elements, very thematic in a lot of ways. There is a problem with alpha players trying to decide everything for the group, but it is a problem more of the players than the game itself, specially that this is a game with some hidden information in cards you hold and it is obvious that the other players don't know exactly the best move for everyone because of it.

Really enjoying this solo. Rule book was confusing but with online tutorial and sample mission it all eventually comes together. Once up and running this is serious fun. Great build-up, surprises and a great feeling when you take down an objective. Even if the mission fails, gameplay is enjoyable enough that it doesn't matter.

RATING: 6.5
Fun solitaire action with RPG elements. Not as easy as it looks. Reminds me of the DVG Leader-Series, just with cards. Plan a mission and go into action. Planning takes a big part in the game. It's like the better late than never Chuck Norris Boardgame, that did not make it to the party in the eighties and arrives 30 years later :-)

Warfighter is a fantastic coop card based war game. I really like the system and will continue to buy everything there is for it. My only issue is that I do wish there were rules for a player to assume control of the opposition. It just feels like sometime the enemies are much easier than other just due to untimely draws. I know that is common for coop games, but I think it bothers me here because of the theme.

This game to me plays like a  card version of the Original Ghost Recon.  I find myself spending more time selecting soldiers and loadouts than actually playing through the mission - which I find extremely immersive.  I become attached to each soldier as the missions progress.  Awesome game and excellent replay value.

A great game, but could have been better produced.  The paper map would have been nicer if mounted.  Also the layout of the board seems weird, no place to put the hostiles, and the locations turn and have cards laying 2 different directions.  More duplicate weapon, equipment and skill cards would have been nice too!  I really like this game, and I can't wait for more expansions of missions and objectives.  The way you select your team and equip them is VERY important!  A great solo game, or with 2 players.

NOTE: Some of the production issues were fixed in the later expansions (mounted board showed up in the footlocker expansion) but, the game plays better without a board!!

RATING: 3.5
At the moment this game is far far below Ambush and Raid on St Nazaire as a solo wargame and it certainly is not in the same exciting solo department quality of Eldritch Horror or Defender of the Realms in the fantasy setting. 

I have difficulties placing it at the moment. Is it really about warfare and an insight on it ?

It seems more a mechanical card game with a military theme attached to it.

Edit: after playing it a few more times, I still can't feel comfortable with this messy rulebook. Each day new questions show up on boardgamegeek that gets answers I still can not find in the desorganised rules.

The rulebook simply needs to be reorganised AND rewritten completely and perhaps even more important: where is the fun and "real" simulation of fire fights I could find in 30 year old Ambush ?

You seem to slug from one card holding place to another, but I don't really get the feeling I am fighting in a jungle.

It feels more like military themed Legendary card game mechanic but with much less fun than shooting Aliens. 

2nd Edit: sold it. The game didn't succeed in what I care for in wargames and it wasn't fun like in other adventure games.

Playing Rambo to stroll along in a jungle with 2 comrades and killing 50 "enemies" is not even a decent simulation.

Very enjoyable, evocative game that creates fun narratives. Although not a theme I particularly care for, it's handled in a palatable, straight-forward manner. You need to communicate, plan, and adapt alongside the other players and the scenarios can become quite absorbing.

Once the rules are properly understood the play is very smooth and intuitive. Learning the rules however can be a chore. The manual covers everything, often with good, full colour examples, but it's all over the place and referencing anything is punishing.

Despite the initial learning barrier to entry, I'd say its very much worth it.

RATING: 8
Butterfield does it again!  Oh, wait.  It's not John Butterfield, but it feels just like Ambush... well, not exactly.  It's somewhat shorter and flows more smoothly.  But it gives you that same connection with *your* men.  

You start out with a mission and objective (either random or picked by you).  Then you've got to choose your team, weapons, and equipment.  The mission determines how many points you have to spend (and how long the game will be) and the objective determines what (if any) special weapons/equipment you'll need at the end.  What's weird is that for a game that's supposed to take as short as 30 minutes, I have yet to pick my team and equipment in less than 20.  For me, this is about half the fun (and depending on the mission about half the time).  

There are a bunch of games that I call front-loaded.  After you've completed the initial setup, the game basically plays itself.  You've got your plan and the rest of the game is to determine if you picked the right one (Kingdom Builder and Terra Mystica are two examples).  Warfighter feels differently.  There's enough randomness in the baddies you face and in the cards you draw, that whatever your long term plan was, you've got to adjust to the realities of the minute.  Decisions are often not obvious and are often dependent on how much risk you're willing to take.  

I recently started playing wargames again and one solo game I'm loving is Enemy Action Ardennes.  However, despite it having a complicated AI, a lot more complicated rules that I've invested in understanding and internalizing, and a more sweeping demesne, even though on a longer scenario Warfighter can take almost as long (2+ hours), I'm still torn as to which to pick.  Between the two of them, I really don't need any more longer (2+ hour) solo wargames.

A generically named game engendering a generic gaming experience.  Lacks the excitement traditional tactical wargames (Squad Leader, Combat Commander, Up Front, Ambush, etc.) are known for.  In my circles, the game has earned the dubious honorific "GAYfighter".  Shiny components don't make up for bland gameplay and an utter lack of any sense of accomplishment.  If this is what the future holds, I want no part of it.  I hereby officially withdraw any further participation on my part in progress.

Update: Part of the lure of this game is taking the time to load out your guys for combat. I've learned the hard way that ineffective preparation can lead to frustration from an unprepared team. It can appear the game is flawed, but it's really because you didn't prepare correctly. 

This is a nice little game and my newfound realization has greatly contributed to my enjoyment and anticipation of the game.

Hate the bullet dice, though. Get some 10 sided regular dice...

The problem is that there is not much to this game. And I have to be in a certain mood to want to play it. That being said, I've bought expansions to try to give the game more variety. Lock n Load and GMT have really taught me a thing or two about real war games.

RATING: 6
Interesting concept, but overall, just too little realism (there is a lot, however) and too much randomness. Like all the DVG solo games, I dislike the "planning" part and much prefer the 2nd half of the game--the actual playing. It also didn't seem to be fit for the solo play. One must choose at least one Player Soldier (in order to have a hand of cards), but you'd probably also need at least another squad or non-player soldier, which means more fiddly equipment and skill cards to worry about. 

I'll trade this, since if I'm going to play a solo game, it'll probably be Fields of Fire or one of the other "Leader" games.

Excellent game!  Plan your missions carefully and then send the team out.  Lots of decisions both before you start and during the mission make this a very involving game.  Each missions seems to generate a small action movie as hostiles gather to attack your squad.  Play the campaign and it just gets that much better.  Great light war game when your life is busy, I can setup play and tear down a mission in about 40 minutes.  Highly recommended.

This is a solid combat game. with a lot to like. 

The pre-game setup with spending resources is interesting.  I like how enemies get assigned when they appear.  The player soldier's hands let you switch things up a bit.  

The rules could be organized a bit better.  A split learning guide and rules reference ala FF's Star Wars Imperial Assault would be an excellent addition.  Also a mission book that added a little flavor to the generic mission and objective cards would be neat too.

Wow! DVG has hit it out of the park with this one. This appears to be an evolution of the ideas and mechanisms with the "Leader" series and Frontline: D-Day. This is the game I wanted Frontline to be. Warfighter is NOT an easy game (or I have yet to get a hang of things). I can't believe I didn't Kickstart this one.

I was initially disappointed by the paper mat but soon after playing I realized that the paper mat was no biggie. Would have liked a bigger box to store the additional cards.

Expansions galore. Though I've only played with the base game. 
As mentioned by others, the system can be adapted for other settings (such as WW2). I would like to see a version inspired by X-COM!

Because of the bad choice regards the victory conditions you have to built your team around few superhero that fight like Rambo and your losses are the lowest of your matter.
Really far from reality.
I played with house rules to correct the simulation bending towards a more real approach and I start enjoying the game very much.

Excellent solitaire game. The pre-game purchasing reminds me most pleasantly of miniatures gaming, where you try to shop for the vicissitudes of the coming battle. The AI is easy to manage, but unfortunately it's very easy to manipulate--each enemy will only target one soldier at a time, so keeping all your people safe is easier (and more deterministic) than is ideal. The rulebook is a bit of a mess.
All in all, though, a very good experience, and a very strong solo design. I'm not sure how good it would be with multiple players, but I'm cautiously optimistic.

Fine game to play. Has a narrative and replayability is good. The rules have several ambiguities. Healing of wounds is described but there is no mention or picture of Bandage in the rules for example, only on the card 'First Aid Kit'. And the layout needs getting used to. The minis are crap and the bullet dice look good but they are not very usable. I do not use them both. The Play Mat is ... shiny. The Cards and Counters are top. Rules: 2 (1-3); Components: 2 (1-3); Fun/Replayability: 2 (1-3); Solo: 1 (0-1).

I enjoy this much more than any other DVG title, including Thunderbolt Apache Leader. (wich isn't saying much..) Because in this one, you start to partically care for your squad. Where in TAL you had nameless clones, now you have full fleshed out soldiers you can pimp out as much as you like.
The gameplay is pretty simple & straight forward, so nothing gets in the way of immersion.

But the most important thing for me is that you can play this as a co-op instead of just solitaire.. (did i mention that i can't stand no co-ops no more?) that means, each player can play the same character over a full campaign & really get attached to him. Suddenly you feel very different about sending "your" guy into risky situations..

The custom dice are useless. The photos are good, the artwork is bad.

First solo play in the books. I think I spent too much time at the first location trying to pick off some drug lords. With only 8 rounds, I should have known that it would be important to focus on moving and close combat.

Really very good indeed. Plays quickly, creates great stories, and is tons of dice rolling fun. The rules are essentially very simple yet manage to incorporate loads of  deep thematic elements without recourse to scads of special rules or exceptions. Replayability is off the charts, so many missions and objectives to try, and building squads of soldiers is very satisfying. An absolute joy. I think the first casualty of this war may be Space Hulk: Death Angel.

KS copy. Besides the goofy plastic dudes and bullet dice it had very nice production quality. Interesting mechanics. I traded it off, I couldn't get into it and I have a pile of other games that are holding my interest ATM (I pledged as an afterthought and wasn't really into it, I guess). Every time I thought about Warfighter too it just seemed to scream at me that it wanted all the expansion stuff to keep it company (not that the base set is lacking or anything). Traded for a copy of Sentinels of the Multiverse; I have plenty of war-themes from a pile of different genres, but I'm lacking (was lacking) a good super hero game.

I like the preparation part of the game, as is very important to have a shot in the mission ahead. Including the expansions, there is a lot of options and a ton of game content to chose from. The gameplay is very easy to grasp and is quite challenging. The only problem I have with it is the bullet dice, they don't work very well and as they come with every expansion now I have a tons of them...

RATING: 7
I really enjoy the building of a squad of soldiers at the beginning of Warfighter. The game itself is quite fun too. As you move soldiers from one location to the next trying to reach the objective, you have to make tough choices as to how to use your actions and how to use the cards in your hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Given the number of soldiers, skills, weapons, equipment, locations, missions, objectives and hostiles, I imagine a potential for practically infinite replayability with this.

While the rule book is a bit ambiguous and confusing (and I would have definitely written it in sequence), once the game is understood, it just keeps getting better with each play.

Only other negative is that I quickly run out of room on the board when/if hostiles at any particular location start multiplying. Over all, just a minor logistical problem and really not a detraction from the excellence of this game.

Highly recommended for persons with a predilection for this type of combat. Also own the Footlocker and five expansions, which I also recommend.

Only played solo so far, but it works really well. I love hand management games, where cards are the currency (Race For The Galaxy is probably my favorite game of all time), so this is right down my alley. Feels as thematic as the other DVG games, so a little imagination goes a long way.

Excellent co-op or solo vs the board game. Cool theme not often seen in co-op games and loads and loads of customization options, including building the mission as well as your squad. Will need more plays to decide whether or not the huge amount of customization makes the game finicky, and I could see someone prone to AP taking an hour to do the setup, but overall a fun experience. Update: This game is your favorite action movie in game form. Want to sneak in, knife the guards and plant c-4 on the target? go for it. Want to charge in with machine guns, grenade launchers and helicopter support? Go for it! By far the most fun a game with this many chits and counters can be.

RATING: 9.75
After one play, I really like this game. The first game was a little slow-going, as there are quite a few rules to digest and many things going on as you proceed through the mission. I have no doubt that future missions will play much faster. In my opinion, this game has just the right amount of depth and there are difficult decisions to be made constantly. It also has a great feel as far as the combat and mechanics are concerned. It's great throwing an  M67 grenade or firing a 40mm grenade to take out a baddie. With the high replay value of this game and all the expansions that are upcoming, this promises to be a great play system. 

11/23/14 Edit:
In the middle of my second play and I have bumped my rating up to a 9. Once you get the rules and the flow of gameplay down, this game just screams to be played. This is an outstanding game. Bravo to DVG for turning out an excellent product. This is basically the type of tactical military game I have been waiting to show up for the last ten years. A ton of options/replayability with more on the way, tough decisions, cool weapons and equipment, etc. This game has vaulted right into my Top 10 if not my Top 5 games.

First it was tense and thought I was going to love it, 3 hours later it felt very repetitive, Our mission took seven hours to get through. Played the MIddle East Deck and didn't feel like there was enough variety. The die for breaking cover was way too random. Some cards and abilities mitigate the randomness, but not enough. Wish it was a lot less dice-festy.

This is for the 2nd/3rd Edition ruleset and components. I was a very early adopter of the game, the first edition just seemed to be lacking something at the end of it. Flash forward to the updates, the map in particular and the slight rules tweaks, just about everything being brought up to the Warfighter: WWII standard. Boom. We have a winner.

Really glad I kickstarted this title!

In the first game, I got wiped out because of a bad decision to cut through a village. The low entrance cost (1) lured me but the high reinforcement value (0-3) killed me. Lesson learned!

The game can be enjoyed without the extensions (of which there are currently 3), but the extensions add so much fun weapons, skills, equipment, action, etc. that I highly recommend getting them too.

Rating based on 4 players.

While I had a nice time playing this (the ISIS scenario), my rating is rather low because while it's a fine game it's also oh so not a game for me. It's an entirely tactical game, with loads of modifiers, cards that change the rules, stat numbers, and oddly-shaped bullet dice that are cute but not really usable). I can see how if you really get into the theme how this game would be great fun (especially with things like kitting out your soldiers), but as someone who doesn't, it ended up feeling a bit too much flavour for what the game actually is. It feels like an action movie that I liked enough for what it is, but don't feel the need to watch again.

Oh my. I should have known better than to pay for yet another bland DVG game.
First part of the game is ok: You select the mission, mission type / drop-off method, your team, your equipment, and can even spend some of your precious resource points on extra skills for your team members.
Second part of the game is not so good: You draw some cards, explore and move to next location, shoot some enemies, draw some cards, explore and move to next location, shoot some enemies, draw some cards, fall asleep, explore and move to next location, wonder why you are doing this, and eventually pack up the game before the end. 20 minutes of this is all I can stand.
Nothing, absolutely nothing, interesting happens. There are no real decisions to make, no tough choices, no story is unfolding, nothing except dullness and emptiness.

I have enjoyed the solitaire experience of this game. Simple, but with good mechanics. My only criticism is that the point allocation at the start of some missions is unbalanced. If we are using special operation forces, their training would mean higher proficiency in many areas. Special forces deploy with customized weapons and their marksmanship is above the normal soldier. This would mean that in some scenarios skills should be an integral part of the soldiers abilities, not an “add on”. Again the “extras” will make your A-team look like a regular army unit with some perks. There should be a rule and points for regular and special forces. This would add another dimension to a good game.

*November 2014* Not ready to rate this one yet (spoiler: I'm a fan). I will say that this is the first game I've ever played that I actually enjoy the pregame squad building. 

*Dec 2014* Plays: 9......Rating at the moment: 8. 

The best part of this game is the squad building pre-mission. The missions themselves are excellent and remind me a lot of Gears of War, despite seeming completely different on paper. Due to the squad building, it feels like you're a lot more in control of the luck in this game. I'm regularly beating the Jungle missions; perhaps the Mid-East missions whooping my butt a few times will change my perspective. 

All in all, the game is excellent and is at least a keeper for a very long time.

RATING: 8
Pros: Endless replayability due to the infinite number of choices you have for team members, equipment, support weapons as well as combatants to fight against. Generates an interesting narrative that has an rpg element to it (which I enjoy). Expansions add a lot to the game but are hardly necessary for enjoying the system. Pretty good tutorial.

Cons: Bullet dice were a good idea in theory but not so good in application. New players can be overwhelmed by the sheer number of decisions to be made before you even begin playing the game (somewhat mitigated by the tutorial, however). Large luck element. If you don't like luck and chaos in your games, you probably will not enjoy this one. 

Just ordered this with all of the expansions yesterday from DVG. I'm not really into modern combat but this looks like a clever design and Marco's review helped explain the game quite a bit. Looking forward to getting it soon!

The only negative thing is the fact there are only 1 copy of most weapons and if more then 1 soldier wants one you have to use a spare card to represent it which really makes things messy.

Fun game for a while. However I've not felt in quite while so much tinkering with a game. There is no real assault rifle range in the game. In fact all weapons except sniper rifles are on their optimal performance on very close. Meaning that when its right range to use MG, one could as easily hit the opponent with fist (and get sure suppression... unlike with MG). Also the game is very, very easy & not so well balanced. The missions are samey, the core being same every time. Anyways I think this game could have been much better.

Fast and compelling game. Great narrative flows through the missions. The d10 bullet dice are nice but useless. The yellow miniatures are ugly and easily breakable (not the right type of plastic, some came already broken in the box). The playmat is too large and not necessary. The cards are sturdy and appealing, just the tables are a bit confusing at first, need better formatting but after a few plays it's not a problem anymore.

Despite the rules are not well organized and laid out, the game is simple enough to start playing easily. The gameplay reminds Gears of War without the map. Overall a very good game.

The shopping in preparation for a mission is tremendously fun and quite realistic, with lots of viable strategies and tough tradeoffs.  The missions themselves are also quite good, with a lot of time pressure traded off against safety and resource management.

The rulebook is a mess -- everything is there, but it's scrambled together in a poorly organized fashion.  It's easy to miss a rule or have trouble finding a ruling, but fortunately the game is quite tight so there isn't a whole lot to lookup or remember once you get going.

I have a few plays in and really look forward to playing more. I own the first three deck expansions and incorporated them into my first game. So my experiences are based on everything all at once.

[b]What I Like[/b]
:d10-1: [b]Great replayability[/b]: The combination of soldiers (in three different classes each with their own use), weapons, equipment, skills, missions, objectives, and enemies mean you can fight a dizzying number of missions with the same or different soldiers and never fight the same battle twice. The player card deck also ensures tremendous variety as it affords the player many options that are delivered randomly through each mission. Play the same mission twice with all things being the same and you'll still be faced with different challenges and opportunities with the cards you draw.

:d10-2: [b]Mission preparation[/b] Each mission requires a bit of time and effort to select the soldiers who will fight along with the weapons, equipment, and skills they carry. This step is important as your success relies heavily upon it. Each player soldier has different attributes that make them better than one other in certain situations. They will be further customized with equipment, weapon, and skill cards. Many equipment cards have skill cards that offer the same benefit. For example, you may wish to improve the aim of a soldier but he can't afford the weight cost of a scope. So you could give him the Marksman skill to increase his aim instead as skills don't cost weight. Kind of silly but it makes for some fun choices. Anyway, I really enjoy this aspect. If you don't enjoy planning be warned.

:d10-3: [b]Mission play[/b]: Once you're playing the actual mission you need to figure out how to advance against a hostile force across terrain (location cards) that offer you different challenge and sometimes advantages. Hostile forces appear as you progress. Each tends to have some strengths and a bit of unique character that you will have to overcome with tactical play. Here is where the efforts of your planning combined with the player action deck give you the options and abilities you need to advance against your foes and neutralize them. This is a very involved part of the game that supplies the meat of the fun. I really enjoy prosecuting the missions.

:d10-4: [b]Campaign play[/b] I haven't played it yet, but the game offers campaigns you can take your soldiers through. Similar to the Leader Series, their abilities will improve over time as they acquire more skills as the campaign progresses if they survive.

[b]What do I Wish was Better?[/b]
:d10-5: [b]Hostile attacks[/b]: Each hostile attacks the same soldier as long as the hostile card is in play. This is kind of silly as it allows you to prioritize your attacks against those Hostiles you know will hit your most vulnerable or important soldiers. This can be modified easily by adjusting the assignment of the target draw until immediately before the Hostiles attack or to just randomly determining it each turn. Basically, I think the Hostile card AI isn't terribly inspired but I'm not terribly upset by it.

:d10-6: [b]Fire mode[/b]: Weapons have one, two, or three fire modes. Semi, Burst, or Auto. All hit on the same number but allow more or less dice to be rolled depending on the fire mode you choose. This strikes me as a little unrealistic as the more rounds you fire at once, the more inaccurate that fire will be. It's not a big deal and likely won't bother most players. I do have some ideas for adding a simple variant to make each fire mode slightly more realistic. I'd also like to see automatic fire mode able to suppress more than one hostile per attack by the rules.

:d10-7: [b]Kickstarter gimmicks[/b] The plastic miniatures and bullet dice were unnecessary fluff. I wish the resources used to develop them would have been used to add more cards or a better board. The dice are kind of fun but you have to roll them properly. They are prone to roll a long distance off the table or can give indecisive results if rolled on a felt surface. The miniatures are small, yellow, and fragile. One of mine arrived broken. Many players seem to be using just the counters or adding higher quality miniatures of detailed Lego type soldiers.

:d10-8: [b]Board/map[/b]: The paper map is useless to me. The design does not facilitate ease of play. I strongly recommend printing off some alternate sleds, location cards, or mats in the file section. Unfortunately for the Wave 2 Kickstarter it seems like DVG will double down on the useless map and provide a mounted version.

:d10-9: [b]Box size[/b]: The box is too small to hold all the core game with the three expansion decks. This seems pretty cheap and tacky to me as they have included a bigger box complete with artwork fluff as a costly expansion for the Warfighter wave 2 expansions. This is disappointing and reeks of a gimmick to draw in more cash even if this was not their intent. 

[b]Summary[/b]
Warfighter is a fairly fast playing game that relies on planning, action, and tense decision making to draw you in at the expense of some realism. It's fun to equip your soldiers, but it's kind of silly that not every soldier goes with a scope, knee pads, etc. Give it a try if you're into modern military, wargames that play solo through many players, and like some planning. If I had to describe Warfighter, it would be like the combination of a first person shooter video game with a dramatic cinematic scene in a war movie played as a board game.

Good game. Kind of like a miniature game or even Death Angel, but more gear focused and more tactics. Love the Modern Warfare Theme and even more the Special Forces Theme. However, I wish you could carry more gear and do more with your gear. As it is the load limit of equipment you can carry and the resource points you have limit what you can take. I am thinking about House Ruling it so that the bad guys are tougher and you can carry more stuff to better simulate the amount of interesting gear a special forces team might carry.

Played this almost 10 times, and look forward to playing it many more. Really fun Call of Duty style boardgame.

The balance of using cards and actions with the equipment you choose for your soldiers is a great time.

Rating based on playing a friend's copy. The game drips theme and the action and the narrative are what you would expect from a game based on Special Ops. The customization and player scaling are just spot-on. Great game.

Like a few of the DVGs, the setup is where a lot of people enjoy this more than me (bit like Magic/Netrunner etc - I don't like the deck-building, I prefer the playing); but when you get into a mission it's very thematic, very exciting and just plain good fun.

Most interesting part of game is deciding on load out. Other wise not very interesting decisions, move, roll , pass ammo,kill,

Very nicely produced and a clear rule set.

I don't know.  I guess that the loadout of a special forces team didn't really interest me as much as loudouts of Airplanes or whatnot.  And the tactics that come from moving your dudes through the stepped rail of cards didn't seem all that tactical. 

It's not a strong representation of DVG I think.  I think I'll stick with the Leader series and Field Commander going forward for them.

Lot of solo or co-op fun. It seems a little easier than the WW2 version, but the gameplay is still fantastic. I have the 2nd edition, so no worries about the play board and components. Very enjoyable.

Probably the best game DVG has published to date. Fast-paced, immersive with lots of combinations, and a combat system easy to play but cleverly designed.
The various extensions not only add new features to the game, but also orient the gameplay to different aspects of warfare.

RATING: 8
Rating may well shift down over time, but right now I'm having a blast.  My initial impression is very positive: I love tactical games, modern warfare, and solo-friendly systems, so I've been in heaven.  The system works really well for generating quick yet evocative battles, and the diversity of gear, skills, etc. is super fun to play with.

A few points of concern that might cut down the replayability for me:
- I either missed my calling as a special forces operative, or this game just isn't very challenging.  At this point, I've lost one out of nine games, and it's not uncommon that I'll go most of a game without an enemy getting off a clear shot.  It's remarkably satisfying but I'm not sure how it will hold up if the challenge isn't there.  Already feeling like there isn't much incentive to go up against the Cartel, which is a shame because I much prefer the jungle setting.
[Edit: the campaign game is where it's at.  Haven't successfully finished one vs. the insurgents.  The combo of tougher baddies and especially the early point restrictions make for quite the puzzle.]
- The expansion situation is a little out of hand.  Thankfully DVG had them in stock because no one else did, but after buying 1-3 I really can't justify getting more at 20 dollars for 60 cards.  (Especially when each one comes with another set of bullet dice!)  If they were ten bucks a pop, I would have bought them all.  Putting counters for expansion-only weapons in the base game was a touch of evil genius.
- The rulebook is haphazard, vague in places, and generally hard to use.  Thankfully the overhead is low but the first few games it was annoying trying to find, say, how explosions or suppression worked.  
- Counters don't exist for some things that would be really useful -- for instance, Hydration Packs or tracking which locations have been entered with On Point.

Despite all this, at the moment I'm happy to have this and am having a lot of fun.  We'll see what I'm thinking about it a year from now.  I do have some local friends who really liked this game, so hopefully that'll help keep me hooked!

RATING: 7.5
Read a lot about it and watched play throughs and was totally hooked. After playing it myself, I really like it - a rather non-fiddly solo tactical war game on squad level for small missions. I especially like the easier jungle missions, got a really nice experience out of it. Rule book could be a bit better, but it is easy enough to find your way in the game. It kinda feels like the prep phase of miniaturen gaming (where you build your team) with a card based variant of Gears of War attached.

About [thing=149951][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=149951][/thing], from now on, just [thing=149951]Warfighter[/thing], is a card game about modern warfare, using hand management and action points as main mechanics. It also has cooperative play and a campaign mode, but it seems more directed to solo play, which is how I have played it.

[thing=149951]Warfighter[/thing] can be sort of intimidating from the start, for those not used to wargames, since it has a good amount of chits and the rulebook is bigger than most of the usual fare of amerigames and euros. However, once one gets into it, things are a lot easier than the first look would lead to believe: the rules are easy enough, even if, due to the nature of having cards with several effects, there are some corner cases not completely covered by the rules, and some consultations of the rules will happen. Still, the flow is steady and the pace, lively, as all the phases can occur fast and the combat is done pretty quickly, with just one die roll per attack made.

The game has luck, not only in the drawing of actions, locations and enemies, but also in the roll of the dice. Still, combats aren't a given thing, no matter how planned and how well trained the soldiers, therefore, randomness is part of the deal.

[thing=149951]Warfighter[/thing] has a high replay value, as it comes with several missions and objectives, and, for each mission, the players can customize the team they sent: every mission has a total amount of points that players can spend to create their team, from picking a soldier, to weapons and skills. If this wasn't enough (and it is) to explain the replay value, there are random enemies and the draw deck of action cards, from where come also the locations the soldiers will need to pass, is also random. This also connects with the good level of thematic flavor the game has, coming from several places: the way locations are thought-out, how weapons and equipaments work, the AI of the Hostiles, the needs to fulfill the objectives, etc.

Overall, [thing=149951]Warfighter[/thing] offers a lot of possibilities, from deciding which team and mission/objective to embark, to how best use cards and weapons, passing by which enemy to take down, which locations to go through, and so on. A rich environment done smartly.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
I will try to make it short: first the player chooses a mission and an objective related (there are jungle missions, so you would choose jungle objectives, for instance).

The mission shows the amount of points you can spend to create and equip your team. There is also the time you have to complete the goal, the distance the objective is, and some other mission-related rules.

Each soldier has informations on their cards about their value in points, how many life points they have, how much they can carry, the difficulty to hit them, their movement, and other things. Weapons have informations about ammunition, range, weight (loadout cost), firing options, etc. Skills and other equipaments have informations about what they do to help (as example, Marksman, a skill, gives +1 to all ranged attacks).

Once the team is built, is time to start the mission. During the turn, the player has, normally, two or three actions with each soldier/squad/npc. The possible actions are:

- Play cards that use action;
- Attack, be ranged or melee. When attacking, the player chooses, for weapons that allow this, the mode of firing, to use more dice, which also increases the chance of needing to reaload. The player than rolls for two things: to reach the hit number of the weapon, and to beat the cover of the Hostile. If only one of these things happen, the target is Supressed. If both happen, the target is killed; 
- Move, which also costs cards;
- Discard and draw - the main soldier (considering solo play), starts with a hand of cards. During the play, when an action is used to draw cards, the player draws cards until she has the number of cards equal to the current health of the soldier;
- Reload;
- Remove Supress.

Then, once all actions are used, it is time for the Hostiles turn. In order this happen:
- Reinforcement draw - location cards usually have a reinforcement number on them. The player draws from the Hostile deck and see if the value of the Hostile is equal or less of the location, and if it is, the Hostile enters play, otherwise it is discarded. Some Hostiles also have reinforcement on them, and it is resolved in the same way;
- Attack - each Hostile, when drawn, once a location is put in play, receives one token, draw randomly, showing which soldier/squad/npc they will attack. They attack in the same way of the soldiers - rolling dice to hit and to beat cover, and can either miss, supress or wound;
- Close range - if the target of the Hostile is out of range, the Hostile moves 1 space;
- Remove Supress counters.

Finally the Timer is moved. A new round begins. This will happen until the time runs out (mission failed), all the soldiers are dead (mission failed) or the objective is fulfilled (mission accomplished) - whichever happens first.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
First it will be: how to best create your team. This will be the very important as it will both open and restrict your options during the execution of the mission, as well as deciding the level of difficulty - more points expend, more Hostiles to deal with.

Then, during the game, the main decision will be:
- What action to use - some will be given, as using an action to take a surpress counter from a soldier/squad/npc, however, most of the time, the choice of action, and the timming of them, will carry great effect in the gameplay.

Among the choices of actions, the most usual and important will be:
- Which enemy to strike, with which soldier, using what weapon/fire mode;
- When to move and which cards to use to pay for this;
- Which location to put in the path (as locations have several differences one from another: number of Hostiles, entrance cost, reinforcement level, and some unique effects).

The decions, many of the time, won't be too hard. Yet they are important, and several also carry costs and have possibilities of creating difficulties (such as reloading, or spending - for instance, when using a granade), and the players must consider these while deciding what to do.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- High replay value;
- Great level of customization for each mission;
- Lots of possibilities during play;
- Simple AI for the Hostiles, making the game easy to be handled, both in solo as in multiplayer;
- Gives a strong thematic feel.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- The game uses both art and real photos in their cards. The photos are ok, but the art tend to have some that are pretty weak - very uneven;
- The manual is organized in a way that is weird to me, and made learning and looking for information harder than it should;
- Missed the opportunity to include some scenarios pre-built, not only to help players start quickly in some cases, but also to pass on some real combat operations;
- The bullet dice, specially the d10 (they roll way too much), are bad to the point needing to be replaced asap;
- The miniatures not only have little value, they detract from the gameplay, as they make harder to tell, at a glance, where everyone are - the use of the chits is simply cleaner and better.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Likely as a bad mission commander. I'm constantly thinking, when things happen: "why did I sent Rowe? I know he can't shoot straight. I should have sent Samaniego. And who had the bright idea to only use short range weapons? Ok. Everyone went forward then... Yes, only to everyone receive damage by the missale. But at least I can Supress it... No. I discarded it to enter here. Nice. One must wonder why I'm still in charge." But, when things do go right, the feeling of proud, or ownership of the result, since you built the team, is strong and very nice.

[thing=149951]Warfighter[/thing] has a lot going on for it: from the possibility of crafting teams and try new formations (making the replay value go through the roof, even with only the base game), to the deep thematic flavor of the situations and cards. [thing=149951]Warfighter[/thing] is a truly well done game, even if not perfect - you can't just sit and start to play (again, I wished for more pre-built scenarios), one needs to spend time building the team -, its flaws are, for the most part, in the production department, which doesn't actually detracts much from the gameplay itself. And is possible to just slap fast a team together and sent out.

In the end, [thing=149951]Warfighter[/thing] goes well recommended for those looking for a solo game, with clean mechanics, quick resolution to combat, high replay value and several of decision-making points, with the counterpoint of requering some work to start the missions: but the pay off is to see if the team YOU build will do the job. Mine, most of the time, don't - but I live on the edge!

A quality game with a quirky scaling problem. Higher player counts in this game make it feel really stacked against the players without min-maxing builds. Stick with three players or less for an optimal experience.

RATING: 10
This game is pure excellence. Essentially, the fun is split into two parts: Building your squad and going on the actual mission. For any fans of soldier loadout customization, this is the game for you. Each mission gives you a certain number of point allocation and you use those points to pick your squad and your gear. 

The missions play out in location-to-location movement style set in either the Jungle or Desert region. Players drop locations and move towards their mission objective, while enemies spawn on locations and reinforcements come out each turn. Dice based combat adds random chance, but a better loadout equals a better strategy. Grenades help deal with groups, snipers have longer range, explosives help deal with conveys, etc.

The majority of the artwork is of real photographs of U.S. veterans and locations, which either get loved or hated. Some location art (like a Drug Cartel Camp) is digitally created, looking out of place but it's understandable why these images can't be obtained. Artwork should never speak for amazing gameplay though. 

Warfighter feels like a war novel or movie. Traveling from location to location feels thematic and tells a story. You begin building relationships with these soldiers over their missions too. As long as you enjoy squad customization and tactical warfare, you'll enjoy this game.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] I love the modern warfare theme. Gameplay is fast and the replayabilty is good. The gimmick bullet dice are of course stupid and useless. The paper mat is horribly designed. That being said, you don't really need the mat to play the game. The photos are good, but some of the artwork is bad. Especially on the Jungle Cartel cards. There are only one copy of each weapon, but once you get the expansions that's not an issue anymore.

Pretty fun.  Good coop wargame with LOTS of die rolling.  I like the cover/suppression/kill system.

Warning: Players can spend 20+ minutes in the prep stage selecting their squad members, skills, and loadouts.  This will appeal to classic videogame RPG fans, who seemingly love the minutiae of character generation more than playing the actual game, but I don't fall into that category.  I prefer to set up and just start shooting.  Where's my pre-made character, sarge?

Also, I'm not sure that the more challenging scenarios are better than the simpler scenarios.  They're longer, sure, but not necessarily more enjoyable.  At the 90-minute mark, my attention wanes considerably.

[i]Update:[/i]

Rating lowered.  For its weight, Warfighter takes too much prep and is far too long and repetitive.  I'd much rather play Castle Ravenloft with plastic army men substituted for the orcs and goblins, or play Pathfinder with photos of enemy soldiers/leaders pasted over the monster, villain, and henchmen cards.

The 90-minute cutoff is key.  If the game goes longer than that I'd rather suck napalm than keep plugging away.

I didn't know what to expect exactly from this game. And I discovered a game with easy enough rules (but not the best written rules by far), very challenging. I have played it cooperatively, the first mission, an "easy one" has been full of fun and achieved at the last minute.

A phenomenal game and my first DVG experience.  Among my favorite solo romps and a game that will only sweeten over time.  The graphic design is a bit ugly, but it's something I'm more than willing to forgo because what's there is so awesome.  In its first month on the table, Warfighter has found its way into my cherished collection of favorites and most-played.

Using the images of real service men and women was a really, really nice touch and I find myself totally immersed in the conflict.  This is a game I like to leave out for days at a time.

Bravo DVG!

I expected to immediately fall in love with this game, but that didn't happen. Instead it took me 15 plays, but now I can hardly pull myself away from the table.

This appeals to me in the same way as Hornet Leader: Carrier Air Operations, in that I spend a lot of time planning each mission. I go back and forth on how to spend my Resource Points, and best kit out my soldiers without going over their Loadout limits. It's an incredibly enjoyable process for me.

It was hard to get into the game with the huge number of options I had at my disposal, as I bought the Footlocker, base game, and all expansions at the same time. This overwhelmed me a bit to begin, but after 15 games I love the variety it offers, and already look forward to yet more options.

I have now played this game cooperatively with other players (with both 2, and 3 players), and am glad to report that it still rocks! I want to try it with a few more, but think that it may well top out at about three players.

Excellent game. Highly enjoy it.  The straegy is fun and realtivly easy to learn.  The art is good too.  Fantasy Flight Games make solid products.  And LCGs are way, way, way better than CCGs.

Mechanics aren't tied to the theme well enough. The split of combat mechanics into three colors feels artificial and too abstract. Most importantly, the cards don't look pretty!

It's alright for a CCG/LCG, but using a similiar system to Warhammer:Invasion and Call of Cthluhu, its better than Call of Cthulhu, but can drag on a little bit more...

This one supposedly shines as 4 players, which I haven't tried yet - so at the moment I am giving it a conservative rating.

RATING: 5
Played with 4-Players without knowing the books:
One of the worst games I've played in the past year. For 2-Players or four very experienced players this might work better, but having to overlook around 40 cards on the table and makes a reasonable decision impossible. Therefor you just choose someone to attack and then you always overlook some tiny special ability. Because of everybody reading all 40 cards again on their turn, the downtime is horrible for a card game. Therefore the game took 3h after the 1h explaining. Also much too long for a game that you can't really influence enough with 4-players, because I always had initiative and so I somewhat attacked the leading player (which could still defend well) and got squished afterwards by all others and then one of the others wins the round by grabbing alot of power.

Nicely themed game with some interesting decisions.  Asymmetric, and to play well it requires a fair amount of knowledge of the available cards, of which there are quite a few.

RATING: 6
Well designed game, but WAY too much going on (and way too long!) for casual play.  Steepest learning curve I've ever experienced.  Game flow is easy to learn but the MASSIVE amount of constant card text is overwhelming.  I played this with experienced gamers, even Magic players, and after 2 hours we gave up un-finished to move on to something else.  I can't see playing this again, as this is not a pick up and play game.  If you want to play this, you need a committed group that can take the time to learn all the cards in the base set.  Everyone spent tons of time just reading cards, and the analysis paralysis was extreme.

(B&L Own) Terrible, horrible "game". Gave away to a friend.

Cards that force you to destroy everything you've built up are the bain of my existence. After the first time it happened in this game, I vowed to never play again. When a player can screw you over so completly, and do it every round with one of his main plot cards, i'm not interested in playing anymore.

Why it's not compared to Fluxx is beyond me.

I don't understand why people introduce LCGs to people by just saying here's a deck and go. I've got no idea of the strategy of the deck or what it's supposed to do, let alone what half the cards do. Too late for me to jump on the bandwagon and I don't think multiplayer card games work (which is how it was introduced).

Unfortunately I just haven't been able to play this much.  The board game seems to be much more popular, although I'm not convinced that the board game is as amazing as some make it out to be.  In fact, I'd go as far as to say it's a tad overrated.  The card games has some pros compared to the board game.  It's quicker, and most games take < 2 hours.  It also has a great 2v2 team mechanic and there's arguably more diplomacy since you can trade gold and bribe other players.  The downsides...: card randomness (although the board game is full of randomness, e.g. random opportunities to bid for turn order is arguably worst than randomly drawing a card you need).  There's also a lot of text, symbols and abilities for new players to grasp.  I give it 6/10 because I haven't managed to convince others to play it much, but that could increase if I get a few good games with it.

Really like this one. However, not everyone is interested in playing, it is difficult to learn/teach, and can be a very long game for new players. One player can also be very overpowered, making the game tedious instead of fun when this happens. Not much different than the television version we owned previously. Looking forward to playing with more players and after getting some expansions.

+ Awesome source material; Very clever mechanics, especially the different types of challenges.
- It's a LCG.


Why it's previously-owned:
This feel victim to the hang-up that I have with all CCG/LCGs... unless you have someone else who is willing to invest the money and the time to develop their own decks, you will never have someone to play with that has a compatible interest in the game.
I ended up giving this game away to an interested friend when we moved across the country.

Very disapointed in this one.  I'm a big fan of the books, and the cards do a good job of capturing the characters, but the ease of killing off major characters really ruins it for me. The only reasons it does not get a 1 from me is that I do feel they did a good job with the overall theme, and the components are good quality, but that does not make up for a completely unenjoyable gamign experience.

RATING: 9
Far superior to magic, and certainly the best LCG/CCG.  What makes it so good is the plot deck mechanic, where players select cards from a separate deck that offer powerful rule changes/temporary effects.  In the main phase, players make three challenges each round that attack hand/board/score.  Games can be from 20-60 minutes, depending on deck types.  The theme is pretty strong, but even if you haven't watched the show or read the books there's a really great game here.  After the reboot to second edition, you can pick up a collection of cards really cheaply and have a great game for your group.  Drafting is so much fun.  I played ten or more games a week for several years and didn't get bored because you can mix up the decks in many interesting ways.

Always willing to play this one. Amazingly fun.

The fact it is VP based, and those VPs can be moved around the table, is pretty amazing. Definitely the LCG winner in Fantasy Flight's line-up, and this is coming from a Neuromancer fan! 

I only found this game while waiting on Netrunner, but now that I own both, Game of Thrones is the title of choice amoungst everybody in my group.

The core set makes for an awesome, fun, tense 3-4 player game. As a 2-player it's still poor, though.

The Time of Ravens series has been slightly disappointing because it presents a handfull of themes not terribly well supported (as it wasn't designed for the LCG but the older CCG).

I'm eager to get my hands on the Kings of the Sea exapnsion.

Rating +2 with two Players for being a great complex card game with many different strategies.

Rating -2 with thee or four players for a game of confusion, senseless politics ("If you don't attack me now, I won't attack you later" - "OK" - "Backstab!") and one of the worst instances of analysis paralysis I have ever seen.

Can be involving and absorbing at best, but at worst can just turn into a backstab fest where the only thing that matters is who is against who. And with so much on the line, it can often turn me off to its great mechanics. Still, the good outweighs the bad.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
For Trade: Core set only, no chapter packs

Rating after 3 plays, strictly with the core set, all 2-player. The decisions in this game are just annoying to think about. I like the idea of this game, but the execution is lacking. When players get a lot of things out, the options for what to attack with can become overwhelming. You have to consider way too many combinations and permutations, and unlike other games with that sort of thing (i.e. chess), it's just not very interesting to think about. 

That wouldn't be the end of the world, but on top of it the cards are just annoying. Some cards are characters that essentially cannot be killed (save character from being killed by returning it to your hand). This renders the military challenges essentially irrelevant, and makes the game very silly. Add on a poor rulebook, and the fact that my third play of this took over 2 hours (how the hell does a game like this take that long?), and this is one I don't see myself playing again. My one hope is that maybe it's redeemed in 3+ player games where things aren't so zero-sum predictable with challenges and there's more diplomacy and subterfuge.

I am a (not Über-enthusiastic) fan of George R. R. Martin novels, and in the past I've put my hands on some cards in the CCG era of the game, even participating in some small tournaments. When the local group dissolved, everything was forgotten but I never managed to sell the old cards.
Recently my interest in the setting was re-triggered by the TV show, and began looking differently to LCGs (I despised them before, but without having tried them) when I got sucked by The Lord of the Rings LCG...
So I decided to buy a copy of the core set of A Game of Thrones LCG.
The game, as far as I can see, was polished a bit, adding also a very interesting multiplayer option.
Too bad there is already lots of expansions around, with (of course) good cards scattered everywhere... And too bad (of course, as we talk about a FFG game...) there is a bunch of erratas and FAQs to read if one wants to play the game competitively.
Anyway, the game looks promising and challenging enough to grant some entertaining play time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
FFG's marketing is clever, for sure, but I am starting to become bothered by the necessity of buying a second or third core set to build decks...
AGOT is the second in the series of the double-core-set, and I wonder if it is the last one...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
as a complete-in-the-box game, this would get a 6. it's fun enough, but the rulebook sucks quite a bit, there some things aren't there at all, and some are still very unclear. the gameplay is a bit disappointing - there isn't that much in terms of decisions to make, you mostly just play the hand you've got.

expansions - this is the reason I rate this 5 and not a 6. the expansions force you into the deck-building mode, and not the play-the-game-out-of -the-box mode. if they were complete decks, or had official ways to use them, i'd be much more interested in the whole lcg thing, and would likely rate the game a bit higher. forcing you into deck building means you only get to play this with fans of the game, it's not something to take out with new people, as I hoped it would be (the gaming being complete-in-the-box).

final verdict - if you are NOT interested in collectibility, and are NOT a fan of the books, this will be limited fun, and there won't be any expansions that interest you.

I must be nuts. (Craaazzzyyyyyy ... toys in the attic....)

Solo Play - 4-player - not even finished the game. Love it.

Yes, went and bought all of the expansions available. Even the first set (black-bordered). Now (01/05/2011) sorting and organizing.

Any questions? :)

And, played a joust teaching round with the fiancee. Promising here! Almost two years ago I tried teaching Magic to her with disasterous results. Either she's more open to the learning process (she was VERY resistant back then) or has developed thicker 'newbie syndrome' skin when it comes to learning games (now that she has 20+ other games under her belt). Anyhoo, she seemed to get the concepts (she played Baratheon vs my Stark). I'll need to scrub the decks for better joust play (they had the melee cards included which tripped up things a bit).

11/2011:  Ran through a few 3 and 4 player games to get more of a feel. Played Martel,Stark,Lannister,Baratheon during these times. Like Martel,Lannister. Still lots to learn.

There is a lot to learn when playing the game.  During the learning game, maybe play to only 10 power.  Additionally, a 6 player game has a lot going on, I'd only play a 6 player game with people familiar with the rules AND most of the cards.

EMOTICON REVIEW: :)

22,Sep.09
We had our first (2 player) session today that lasted more than an hour and a half and we weren't even close to finish it. It is a very enjoyable card game [b]but[/b] first you have to learn your deck in order to make any combo that makes sense thus fully appreciating the mechanics of the game. Also many of the cards have symbols on them that are not described in the rulebook and many cards to be payble need 3+ players. I'll start with a  7.

26,Sep.09
2 hours/2 players. Better understanding of the cards but still some questions. Still a 7.

20, Nov.2010
My third play a year later. With 4 players. Absolutely fantastic, highly recommended with 4.

This game is really too long for what it delivers. We have had to create a houserule to have the winning condition be 10 power rather than 15 and the game still goes at LEAST a couple of hours.

RATING: 5
This is a fantastic multiplayer customizable card game, probably the best there is. I love the mechanic (similar to the leaders in the board game) whereby each player has a deck of seven plot cards, all of which they must play. It really reflects the idea of longterm plotting I look for in a multiplayer game.

Edit: Two-player, though, is much less interesting without competitive deckbuilding. This game doesn't fit any of my gaming needs/niches, which is sad, as it's beautiful and elegant.

George R.R. Martin's series is captured nicely in this incredibly detailed, amazingly thematic CCG. Each family has a distinct feel that is totally consistent with the books: the Starks excel in good old honest fighting, the Baratheons have lots of military and political power, the Targaryens have cunning and magic, and the Lannisters are dishonest, conniving little shits. If you're not prepared to rail on each other relentlessly for the greater part of an hour, you might not like this vicious, cutthroat game. I get angry playing this even when I win.

Too many unique cards make it very difficult to learn, much less play well. A mix of keywords and icons scattered on the card. I was disappointed in the ambiguity of the cards as well.

Played a few rounds of this one.  Reminiscent of Magic, without all the crazy luck component for building your deck in the first place.  Played very easy, the interaction between players is amazing, your allies become your enemies and right back to your ally, depending on the titles that you are switching out.  It was a lot of fun, very challenging to manage the interactions.

RATING: 8
I really enjoyed my time playing Magic the Gathering, but like a lot of people, I burned out on the wave of new card releases and the money pit of the CCG model. 

Ironically, I got AGoT: The Card Game mistakenly in a trade. But after reading the rules, I was intrigued. This game, in my mind, offers strict improvements over Magic the Gathering. Choices during attacks are on the one hand more straightforward but also more interesting. I like the flow of a turn better, you're rarely drawing useless cards,  and the core set can be played like an "out of the box" board game.

Like any game with a dizzying array of cards and powers, there's a fairly steep learning curve. But if you can get over that hump, I think fans of this style of game will be rewarded.

Interesting factor also is that the two player game plays much different than the 3 or 4 player game. With more than two, you add an element of role selection that creates potential allies (which you can't attack) or oppositions (which net you extra points for successfully attacking). The end result is longer, but also very intersting with the ebb and flow of momentary alliances. Very clever stuff.

Update: Sold this in an auction, only because I expect to switch over to the 2nd edition reboot of the card game.

I usually not one for a collectable card game or even a living card game such as this. I'm not even that big of fan of A Song of Fire and Ice though Game of Thrones is one the tv shows I make sure to watch every episode.  However, this game looks really good.  I received it as a gift from a mostly non-gamer friend that saw a video on it and wanted to try it out but figured I would get more plays out of it.
I really like the three types of attacks (combat, intrigue, and power) and how each one has varied effects on one's opponent.  I also really like the idea of the titles and hope to get more than a few four player games to get the full experience of this game.

Upon playing it, the game is works much better as a four player game than a two player, however; the players must understand their will be alliances and betrayals that occur during the game.  My biggest complaint at the moment is the game's length is a little longer than I think I can get some less hardcore players to deal with.

Finally, an LCG that is more than 2 players! However, it's a completely different experience than the board game as you wage war on three fronts - military, intrigue, and power challenges.

Played with Tom. This is the first lcg I have played and it was what I expected - I enjoyed it. It's not hard to learn the mechanics, but the interactions between the cards and houses would take time to fully appreciate (e.g. I was trying to understand why house Lannister had a card which allowed them to put an army into play for the enemy, but after seeing House Stark's plot play out which gives bonuses for the least characters in play it made sense). While you can pick this up and just play it, it isn't designed to be a casual game, and I don't think you will fully appreciate it unless you play consistently.

Introduced to this at a friendly tournament running at my FLGS where someone leant me a deck. Similar to MTG or CoC LCG in that it has simple basic rules but with lots of things on the cards to complicate matters! The multiple challenge types is good and seems to capture the theme well - e.g. the Starks are no good at Intrigue and the Lannisters churn out money. Seems to scale well from the full 4-player game down to a 2-player duel.

RATING: N/A
There are some very neat concepts in this game, and it does an admirable job of capturing the feel of the books. (Well, at least of the three I've read so far.) Sadly, it looks like four-player just takes a while, particularly for first-time players, who need to try and track a great many mostly-different-from-each-other cards while keeping the game rules and 6-12 keyword effects in mind. I'd happily play again, but would be wary of available time.

I suspect this game shines most in playgroups who really get into it, both because all players will know what  the cards do off the top of their heads, and because they'll build decks which have some sort of plan.

RATING: 5
This game is surprisingly good. After my disappointment in AGoT the boardgame, this is a very joyful experience. So we still CAN play a decent game of thrones after all. 

The gameplay is rich with strategy, tactics and theme. Luck is quite a minimum factor here (unlike the boardgame). Not to mention the customizable deck, but without the agony blind buy of TCG.

A card game based on the Song of Ice and Fire series? It's already picked my interest, couple that with high player interaction, political scheming and strategic backstabbing and it's a recepy for success in my book :). I'm a huge fan of MTG and this game just clicked with me when I played it. IT takes a few playes to get a grip on the strategies and how to use various plots to get the best out of them at the correct time while crippling your opponents so it really puts your mind to work :).

The Game of Thrones card game is very well themed for the series.  It appears to balance the different decks well, though it might take you a play or two to understand how.  You really need to play the strength of your house against the other houses.  The cards were interesting, and the mechanics made sense.  With that said, it's not the game for me.  The weight is too high for me to teach to family, even if they enjoy the theme.  If you misread an ability or don't understand an icon it can put you in a big hole.  I can appreciate the asymmetric deck balancing, but I just didn't like how it played out.

I still have to play this some more to give it a fair review but so far it either doesn't play well with 2 players or can be quickly unbalanced with starter decks.

It seemed fun with 4 players and I certainly want to try some more with the additional cards I have.

I find this slightly better than Warhammer because you can immediately tell from a distance what your opponents cards (mostly) do -- the icons for the different attack types and the characters strength are plain to see.

I also really like that there are 3 separate types of challenges (adds variety) and that it can be played multiplayer.

On the minus side, some of the artwork is downright terrible.  Also, there are soooo many extra cards you can buy that I don't even know where to start.

RATING: 8.1


Excellent LCG that's hard to learn, but worth the effort. "Building a better mousetrap" is my favorite game mechanic, so this is a natural fit for me, but I doubt I'll ever be good at it. At least it scratches that Magic: The Gathering itch I've had for years, but never indulged in because I find the concept of CCG so offensive.

Update: Sold away my collection. It's the sort of game you go "all-in" with, not casually play. I wasn't going to sacrifice my limited play time by having it consumed with mostly AGOT as I have too many other interests. Besides, I have my friends cards I can use instead.

Maybe I'm being a bit too harsh, but this game was really the biggest let down in my boardgaming life. I did my best to try to like this game, I bought two starter sets, I tried it with different people - it was just not rewarding enough. Even being huge fan of A Song of Ice & Fire did not save it. If a game needs multiple float charts to explain a simple turn, then you know you got a stinker. Fun fact: I played Doomtown: Reloaded and I found that game simple compared to AGoT card game. And now with 2nd edition out, I can't even sell my two starter sets.

My favorite deck-building game. It thematically captures Westeros SO well. Each House deck is so varied and each bring a completely different atmosphere to the game, and this feeling is only refined with play after play. Cutthroat elements may not appeal to some, and that's ok, because there are DEFINITELY some intensely mean elements here. I am not sure if I will upgrade to the second edition any time soon. This game is sufficiently enjoyable.

After a few plays, both 2p and multiplayer, I have mixed feelings. Obviously the theme is pretty cool, and the mutiple types of attacks are nice. The ability to play it multiplayer, with the role selection, is really what keeps this game interesting as it adds a diplomatic/political aspect to the game that most LCG's lack.

On the other hand, I don't think the game works at all for 2p games. Too many plots don't work right (or at all) and the military attacks become too powerful. Influence appears to be almost completely useless in the core set. And by most accounts, the rulebook isn't great, as the FAQ is rather huge.

Anyway, stick to 4p games only if you can, and don't play competitively. Just have fun with it.

I have a good win record at this despite the fact that i dont really like it. Its a multiplayer CCG that fully embraces whack the leader. Each faction / deck has a typical ccgish strategy (e.g. Baretheons are a rush deck). You play cards out to claim vps and kill other players cards, or generate more resources to get more cards out etc. Typical ccg stuff with a few twists.

Its ccg mechanics worked to fit with the game of thrones universe, consequently i don't find it to be a thematic experience. I feel like im playing a card game thats pretending to be like the source material rather than an immersive experience.

Multiplayer LCG. Permanent member of collection.
The base set is NOT balanced. A completely different game once you start deckbuilding, and so much more fun. DONT just use the core set. Look up a guide and see what to buy! At least get two cores.

At second thought, this is more of a structured diplomacy game than a card game. And when I deckbuild I want a card game... oh my god I'm going to play call of cthulhu again.

This is my favorite CCG and LCG for that matter, and I feel no shame in saying it's partially due to the liscensed theme. If only there were people to play it with locally =( If I were to actually compare it to Magic or The Spoils in terms of 'fun factor' it would probably have a rating of 9 as well but finally we get a completely different CCG than Magic. The Spoils and WoW have refined Magic's play style and fixed it's resource management but AGoT is it's own game with so many different mechanisms that seperate it from other CCG's, and for that I give it the extra point. 

So what makes it *so* different?  The basics of Game of Thrones is the combat system, game phases, the plot deck, and resources.  Combat is broken down into 3 types of challenges: Power, Military and Intrigue.  Not all characters can participate in all types of challenges.  If you win a military challenge the loser must kill one of their creatures.  If you win an Intrigue challenge, the loser must discard a card.  You win by attaining 15 power but start off with zero.  If you win a power challenge, you steal one power from your opponent. As for the phases, in Magic, the Spoils and WoW each player takes turns going through all of their phases.  In AGoT all players go through each individual phase together (think Arkham Horror).  Example:  Players select plots in the plot phase, players draw two cards in the draw phase, each player plays cards during the marshaling phase, etc.  The plot deck indicates 4 things: how much gold (resources to play cards) you have.  That's not the only way to get gold however.  Plots also determines who gets initiative, the person who wins initiative decides who goes first in each phase if the actions are not done simultaneously.  The third thing is claim, which indicates is the severity of the challenges.  If I have a 2 claim plot and win a military challenge, my opponent  would have to choose 2 of his characters/creatures to kill.  The plot card also has either a special ability, limitation, or something that effects both players.  

This game also has a setup in which each play uses 5 resources to put cards into the game before you actually start playing.  There's also a dead pile and discard pile which have differences.  There is more than one resource as well.  Gold is typically used for playing cards and then there is the influence resource which typically pays for card abilities and events.  In terms of ability/card resolution, it's typically first ability played is the first ability resolved with the exception of cancel effects, where as other CCG's typically have first effect in is the last effect out.

There are other things I could talk about, so I'll move onto 'what's new' with the LCG.  First and foremost: white bordered cards.  Ewww.  Second is a board, plastic mini's and tokens.  The board and plastic minis are not necessary but are definitely a nice touch.  The focus of the LCG was to design cards with multiplayer in mind.  It still functions as a great dueling game but it also is a good multiplayer game as well.  Some think it's because of the various roles but these roles were originally introduced in the CCG.  With gold tokens, they've changed the way gold works.  In the CCG gold was used in the marshalling phase only and any unspent gold was wasted.  In the LCG you keep gold throughout the majority of the phases in a turn.  Cards are now designed with this in mind, so you might see cards that increase with power based on how much gold you have, some event cards/character abilities may require gold, and each gold adds one to your domination value during the domination phase.

You really need to play this game, be it casually with just one core set or neurotically with 3 copies of every single card (which is much cheaper with an LCG compared to a CCG).  You do not need to have read the Song of Ice and Fire book series to enjoy this game, but it will certainly enhance your experience.

The only reason it's not for me is that the multiplayer game is too long for my tastes and my normal issues with physical CCG's/LCG's:

LCG not a fan of this type of game in general (it's really a lifestyle game).  I just don't have the time to devote to buying every expansion and thinking about deck ideas all day anymore.

Prefer deck builders like Dominion over this genre of games too.  Definitely thinking about trading this away as I don't foresee playing anytime soon.

ONE SENTENCE: A fairly good LCG with good (not great art) where players are fighting on three different levels for power.

MY COLLECTION? Let a friend own it.
I have too many games that require decks built, and Magic is my go to.

Rating history: 9|8
* I predict this will fall to a 7/8 for me after novelty wears off. The starter decks are a bit simple, but I don't see anything in the cards that makes me think it will reach Magic levels of fun.

Played 2 times. (3p:2)

1st play: 9. SEP/14. I'll give the first playing a 9. Our 3p game went long (2 hours), but was very enjoyable, in part because it exceeded my expectations for the game. Quite thematic, and interesting as a multiplayer game. The base game alone will probably only rate a 7 for me after a few more plays, but the rules/system of the game are strong, and this could be a high 8 for me. Alas, it is not as fun for me as Magic (yet), so I won't buy into it. I only have money for one CCG/LCG.

2nd play: 8. OCT/14. 3p game in about 75-90 mins (second time for all three of us). The game drops a point because - now that we know the game system a bit better - it's obvious how bad the starter decks are. They don't have enough synergy to lead to an engaging style for each player. I'm not sure if this will rise again with better decks, or stay at 8 because Magic is the game I'm already invested in, so it's hard to want to switch systems. And I own Netunner and Lord of the Rings LCG...and there's only so much time to deckbuild.

There a plenty of GOT/ASOIAF-themed games out there (I'm a big fan of the [thing=6472]board game[/thing] in particular), but if you [i]really[/i] want to dig into the Song Of Ice And Fire theme, look no further. Having now played with 3 players, I can say that the multiplayer titles definitely add to the game, but not to the extent I had originally thought. If you're mainly going to play 2-player, you should certainly not feel like you're missing out on anything.

I now own two core sets, which I combined to build [url=http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/207-4-decks-built-from-2x-core-set/]these decks[/url]. Naturally, I'm interested in any advice anyone wants to send my way regarding how to proceed with expansions.

Multiplayer is okay, but the competitive scene (which focuses on 2-player) stagnates around one or two cards in every cycle. The game is better suited to unskilled multiplayer melees where the core mechanics don't get too deeply explored and you can jam some politics into the mix. In all, very low on the list of recommendations. But if you like the theme it's an easy sell, because there is a ton of variety and the cards (mechanics and all) are very at home in Westeros. For anyone looking to invest serious time and dig in, though, the game is a bit broken and stale.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
OVERWHELMING amount of reading of each card for a beginner (like me) to wade through.

I've tried hard to like this, and I'm sure a familiarity with CCGs would help. But no one I game with wants to learn this game, the terminology AND all the cards for even a basic joust match with the preset decks. Too bad, because there's obviously a good game to be played here once you know it.

Big bowl of "meh".  I wouldn't even rate it this high if it weren't for the Game of Thrones tie-in.

We tried it several years ago when we found some of the CCG cards for really cheap.  I wasn't impressed whatsoever with how the game plays, and the Core Set for the LCG feels exactly the same in several ways.

The two-player game is a shitpile.  Runaway leader problem is INSANE here.  Yeah, I know about the board sweepers.  Guess what?  If you're that far behind, they won't save you, just prolong your agony.  Also?  In one core set, you get two sweepers (for four houses.)  That seems fair?  No, not really.

I will probably trade this away eventually.


EDIT:  I've read on some forums that the game is easily 'fixed' with a second core set, and the poster even provided 4 balanced 60-card decks.  Against my better judgment, I'm going to try that out before I write this game off completely.

Sadly it failed in our game group, I was the only one who liked it (or wanted to give it another try). Too chaotic and too much "work" for few "fun" were comments I heard. Strategy cards like Valar Morgulis (kill all characters in play) were considered too strong and game breaking. Furthermore there was loser bashing in our 4p game (weakest player gets attacked by all others, cause that's the easiest way to get victory points).

It is a little premature to rate this game lower than a "7", usually willing to play. 

I'm sure there is a learning curve to this game, so I'll rate a little more precisely as I get play a little more.

4-player game was a blast. Lots of nitpicking on details and nuances of the rules, but it never got in the way, because reading the cards was a pleasure. The game is subtle, full of surprises, and really made us feel like we were plotting intrigue and counter-intrigue, wheels-within-wheels, Machiavellian style. Fantastic, intricate, and riveting. Took me longer to explain the rules than I'd thought.

RATING: 6
Several of my gaming buddies and I used to play [thing=463][/thing] (although it's been years) and we're all big fans of the Game of Thrones mini-series and books, so this seemed like a natural fit. Unfortunately, it wasn't.

The problem was the length. We tried an introductory game just to get accustomed to the rules and cards, and we called it after two and a half hours. Granted, the reason it took so long was because we needed to teach ourselves the rules while playing, as well as read all the text on our cards as we drew them. I'm sure that later games would go faster as we overcame both of those obstacles. But the harsh truth is, that will probably never happen. This game requires repeated play, or "study," for lack of a better word, and I just don't see that happening. I hate to say it, but there are just too many other games I would rather spend time with.

I recognize it is a good game, but like Battleship Galaxies, I don't think it is right for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Heavier than I thought it would be. The rules are fairly simple, but the text on the cards adds a lot of complexity. My first play took a lot longer than an hour. I found it a difficult to keep track of all of the text on my opponent's cards. For the time investment and the level of thought required, I think I'd slightly prefer playing a campaign in Battle of Westeros.

Update: I've played a few more games including one with three players. It's a really good game, but it takes so loooong. And keeping track of all of the card interactions and figuring out the multiplayer interactions borders on being overwhelming.

Update 2: I'm kind of obsessed with this game. I bought two core packs and the Greyjoy expansion, and I make all my gaming friends play it with me. I'm even playing it solitaire with a "robot" mechanic for an opponent.

Update 3: I want to love this game, but it's just too complex. I've played several times, and I still have trouble keeping everything straight. And forgot about newer players. There's just too much card text to absorb. I played another multiplayer, and I still found the additional interactions to push it well past a reasonable level of complexity.

I may have undershot my mark with this review.  Don't think of my rating as a critique of the game, so much as a warning to proceed with caution.  This is an awesome game, but it is not for everyone.

First of all, you should be aware that the core set's claim to be a self-contained game is a bit misleading.  While you can play with just this box, I think you will quickly find that the game was designed to be expanded and falls short of its full potential otherwise.  The starter decks are full of undeveloped themes and game mechanics that will later be developed into full-on deck archetypes.  Even if you don't want to build tournament decks for this game, I recommend either the four expansions for the core set houses or a cycle of chapter packs so that you can build more focussed decks.

Second, you should be aware that this game is hard.  It's hard to learn, even for a CCG.  Many of the rules I've had to look over several times in order to wrap my head around them, and I constantly run in to nuances that I didn't pick up in my first few months of play.  I know that this sounds like par for the course, but I maintain that it's been more of a problem for this game.

Not only is it hard to learn the base rule set, but it's also really hard to play.  It takes a long time to wrap your head around all of the different unique character abilities and how they interact with one another, or how to build a balanced deck with little to no duplicates.

This game is probably best for seasoned CCG players who are up for a challenge.

If you are one of those players, you will probably love the the deception and bluffing, the intricate webs of character abilities that power the best decks, the mind games that go into building and selecting from a plot deck, and the just the uniqueness of playing a brutal low-fantasy game.  For example, this is a game where if you want to wipe your opponent's board (and not yours) you have to work for it.  You can't just hit them with a big attack; you have to combine the effects of several characters, events, and attachments to "trap them."  It's not easy to set up a powerful move, but when nothing is easy, everything is more rewarding.

Nothing new or even remotely interesting in this boring, random, unbalanced and annoying game. Ridiculously long for what it is, with too many cards with special-power text to keep track - most of which could have been done with icons. It also suffers terribly from runaway leader syndrome. The theme seems to be well implemented and the art is very nice, but those are no substitutes for good game design.

A terrific game, especially 1-1 joust mode.  There's a lot going on here in terms of strategy development and card play--- much more than your typical CCG-type of game.  For instance, there are three distinct ways to attack your opponent so establishing defenses and counter-attacking in the right sequence become incredibly important.

To my experience the game always plays longer than I expect, which keeps it on the shelf more than I would like.
But highly recommended overall.

A very good game that so far plays differently every time we try it.  

We tried joust and melee games and both are fun.  One-on-one games are shorter and so far our favorite.  It takes us about 30-50 minutes to finish a 15-claim game.  Multiplayer games are much longer - last weekend we needed 2,5 h to announce the winner, but we played a couple of rules wrong, so that could be the reason. The titles add a lot to gameplay, though and provide another layer of strategic thinking.  With a larger card pool, especially cards from the chapter packs that precede the Core set, MP games run much faster and usually clock at 60-70 minutes.

Houses feel solid and enable using distinct strategies. Characters are "true" to the books which is an added bonus (e.g. Walder Fray).  I can see the potential of adding new chapter packs and customizing your decks.  Each game can be summarized as a story, which is great - you can discuss it and remember even after several days after the game took place. 

Compared to Magic, the gameplay seems to have more depth due to three types of challenges.  Setup helps to put you right into the game.  

UPDATE: With the grater card pool, the game is even more engaging.  It "forced" me to go back to previous editions, but I do not regret it.  There were so many great ideas and must-have cards in the CCG era that work great together with LCG.  It was said before, but the connection between CCG and LCG is still there and without the CCG cards the experience suffers, because you cannot use the full potential of your LCG cards. The gameplay improves even by adding the older plot cards alone. 

Update: Although AGOT is a good game, Warhammer Invasion is MUCH better.  It plays faster and is more engaging.  Android Netrunner with hidden cards and asymmetrical gameplay is also better.  All good games, but AGOT is no. 3 and it will definitely not climb up.

RATING: 5
I've only ever played this multiplayer (usually 5-6 players) and with the same group of players so there may be some meta-gaming and group-think influencing my opinion.

With this many players, and without structured and binding alliances, the game feels fast and brutal. I don't think we've ever made it through all of the Plot cards for House yet. The winner all-too-often feels like it is decided by Last Man Standing rather than careful planning or strategy.

Pile on the weakest seems the best path to success. As soon as someone is injured, the safest path to VPs seems to be to keep attacking them.

It is a CCG (well TCG now) with a lot of variety and half the fun for most is making decks. Sometimes you'll make a deck that is easily neutered by an opponent. Other times you'll have a deck that monsters your 5 opponents...unless they gang up on you because you're the biggest threat.

Overall my feeling is that the game doesn't really fit into multiplayer very well and whether I win or lose rarely feels like something I had much control over.

In reference to the multiplayer: I want to like this game but I find that it takes way too long for what it is. A card game that relies heavily on luck should not take multiple hours to play. In my book that is just a recipe for frustration.

Watched the rules video, this looks to be a great updating of his prior Mystic Domination and much more refined. Also, the mechanics fit the theme really well and the game looks fun (If you like CCG play). Not sure about the multiplayer game and if it just becomes a big bash the Leader game, but 2 player looks good.

Is this the best card game I own?  Probably.  But it takes awhile to teach.  And the first dozen plays can take a loooooong time as you learn the cards and their interactions.  But there's a LOT of meat on this bird - constant decision points that are varied and meaningful.  Deck building in the LCG format is a treat, not a burden.  If the barrier to entry with the rules set and card lingo wasn't so high, this would be a 9 (or higher?)

RATING: 10
Probably the best CCG-style game I've played. Unlike many other card games of it's type it does not seem to fall victim to the "auto-play" syndrome where all of the strategy happens during deck building. There are plenty of difficult decisions, most particularly during the challenge phase. Knowing how to launch challenges and how and when to defend (and not defend) appears to take a lot of skill. Really looking forward to getting deeper into this game.

After more plays: Still awesome. My only complaint is that the card distributions of the chapter packs and the Kings of the Sea expansion almost force you to buy multiple copies, especially if you're planning to play competitively. Still, for casual play it's fantastic and either way significantly cheaper, and more fun, than any CCG I've played.

Edit: With the changeover to the new distribution format by FFG (3 copies of every card in all expansions), I pretty much have no more complaints about this game. It's incredible.

One of the most interesting CCG/LCG card games I've played mainly due to the well-executed multiplayer aspect.  A workable 3 player game is tough but this one works well and has alot of thematic connection too.  I'd probably play a number of 2 player CCGs firt but this is by far the #1 multiplayer CCG for me.

first blush rating...just played my first game. Had a lot of fun.

I know, I know--I can hear you: but, Jason it's a card game, it's like Magic...

BUT, the Living Card Game Systemn, well it's not a blind buy game...it's not a money race and you know what you get when you buy each booster. 

Now, it IS like Magic in fun (but long live the experience of avoiding the all out money race and blind buys), and you get fun multiplayer, good deck building "strategery" if that's your thing and I just had fun in the is first play.

Would it be my one and only game? No way, but it's a fun play and I'd be willing to play it fairly often. 

I am curious how they'll handle power creep and the expansions...I may pick this system up.

A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is a thematic card game that is somewhat difficult to grasp at first. The number of options available to a player might overwhelm him or her to the point of getting someone else to do it. I have not expanded upon the game nor explored the deepest reaches of Westeros due to the reason stated in the previous sentence.

AGoT TCG has to be the richest, most dramatic, well designed card game I've ever played. From beginning to end, every step has meaning, and from beginning to end, every action will count. IMHO, playing this game is like watching the tv show, or reading the book, with the only exception that you're the one controlling the fate of your house -and not the writers. Fantastic!

Having now played this game about 10 times I can safely say this is my favorite game to play right now.  I’ll wait before placing it in my top 5 of all time but I have little doubt it will make it there.  Never have I played a card game with such a rich, deep, and satisfying playing experience.  Typically CCG’s involve their deepest strategy in the deck building and the game play becomes more about risk management, probabilities, and simple choices.  AGOT is relentlessly deep in every phase.  Like any ccg style game having a good deck is important, but in AGOT the smarter player wins not just the guy with the shiny deck.

Rating from Nov. 2008, made a mistake and logged it on the wrong version.

This one had several things stacked against it:

1. I'm not a big fan of the board game.
2. I don't know anything about the books.
3. I have some weird unfounded bias against CCGs

Add to that some serious downtime and it just wasn't a game for me.  I could see how it could be interesting if you knew all the cards and played really quickly, but it was simply not fun.

Card game based on the famous series of books. Reading the rules, this seems like a simple, straightforward card game. Unfortunately, the playing of it (4 players) was a disaster, with slow playtime and lack of interest all around.

Symbology was pretty bad, with some strange icons so small that many mistakes were made. Most cards for each house are also exactly the same (only names changed) which makes for a pretty boring game. A deck of entirely unique cards to each house would have made this a much better game.

I seemed to like this better than most pure tableau-building games; maybe because there was a bit of multiplayer politics, or maybe just because I won. Still feeling the lack of a spatial element and wanting to try the board 'n' tokens take on the subject. Here, every faction just kind of periodically lashes out at every other faction in a non-thematic way. First game was quite long. Interested in seeing how playing with four shapes the multiplayer politics.

I found the 2-player game to be a more sluggish experience that seemed to turn on the appearance of a few key cards, lacking the balancing (and chaotic) dynamics of the multiplayer game.

A living card game, based on the books by George R.R. Martin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Based on 2 plays of the LCG and 2 plays of the CCG.  Unfortunately, the multiplayer mechanics are the most interesting part of the game, but they are offset by the significant flaws.  It's hard to keep track of everyone's abilities because the text on the cards is so darn small.  The game tends to revolve around teaming up against the leader.  And our 4 player game ran over 3 hours.

Even the two-player game seems to suffer from a "swinginess" - in particular, weakness in Military and Intrigue creates tends to be self-perpetuating as you start losing guys and cards from hand.

It's certainly nice to be able to play straight out of the box, but I'd put this LCG below a number of its CCG ancestors for actual gameplay.

A fairly well-crafted game, although not exceptional. Great balance out of the start kit and the whole idea of a LCG is pretty fantastic. The game was difficult to grasp right away due to the large amount of key words figuring out some of the more intricate strategy. Once I learned the game however and became more accustomed to using cards correctly it became a blast to play. Most of my plays have been with 2-3 players, never with four. The game is worth the purchase and although I haven't, I'm sure it gets better with the purchase of expansions. It plays a bit like magic with some added qualities.

Certainly an interesting game but too many 'little' bits that seemed excessive & made it go a little long for what it is. 

- Choosing the little plastic figures every turn? I could have lived without that...

- Playing the 'Scheme' card each turn (or whatever it was called)? I could have lived without that...

- 3 Different attacks each turn? I could have lived without that...

- You get the idea..! 

You need people who are willing to spend the time reading the cards & getting to know the game. Maybe then it could be cool but I don't really feel it offers enough to put this effort in...

Got most expansion packs + 2 base game. The theme and system of this game is very fun for AGoT fans. This is a classic card game so I won't comment too much. The flaw: it's scary to new users as the system is a bit complex and there are too many skills written in little characters on each card, which makes me feel exhausted after each play, especially when there are more than 2 players.

A great game, especially if you're a fan of the source material. It is the only game format that is able to accommodate the many, many characters of the series. That said it is NOT an easy game to get in to, and the core set is not very well balanced for the 2 player game, so you might need to invest in some expansions to really enjoy it.

Very standard CCG fare. This box contains 4 premade decks with no opportunity for customization of any kind. This card game suffers from the same problem the other clan-centered CCG, Legend of the 5 Rings, suffers from: as the game progresses, the sheer quantity of cards laying on the table overwhelms players' ability to play the game easily and plan effectively. The playing area quickly becomes crowded with scores of cards all with their own unique abilities. It becomes too much.

Card game on the popular saga!

Rating would have been higher had my copy not been missing the title of Hand of the King but allocated an extra Master of Laws.  Some rules ambiguities too.

The game took a longer time to complete than I thought - certainly not within an hour.  It is understandable given that this Living Collectible Cards system encourages both lateral character cards deployment to build a sizable force before engagement, and vertical plot developments to roll out the narratives.  It is certainly more fun than Magic the Gathering because the narratives are strong, contemplative and purposeful. Combat is brutal and a lot of dead.

There are some rules ambiguities on cards that are included in the House deck but can only be played on another House's characters to have any effect. But generally nothing is detrimental. Each player is allocated 10 gold tokens and dealt with 7 Plot cards and 7 House cards to begin with. The plot card sets out the short term strategy that a House is required to perform and claim power tokens. According to the plot card, each player deploys House cards up to 5 gold tokens worth of characters and/ or location cards. The first player who claims 15 power tokens wins the game.

During the "Marshalling" phase, the Houses collect income by the revelaed plot card and any bonuses provided by cards already in play. To play a character card from your hand, you have to pay the gold from your treasury that the card requires. A player can keep on playing the cards from his hand as long as he has the gold to pay. A card that is affiliated with another House cost 2 more gold tokens to play as that character is not a "loyal" subject to your House. Nice. That's how loyalty counts.

To claim the power tokens, you have to win "challenges", which are divided into 3 types - military, intrigue and power. The type of challenge is called for by the active player in any order he desires during the "challenges" phase. The type of challenge can only be taken once during his turn. In general, a challenge is won by the side who can muster the higher total number of the challenges of the characters participating in the offense and defense. A character who participated in an offense or defense would "kneel", or "used", by turning the character cards side-way. The sequence of play in a turn is therefore crucial as part of the player's strategy because obviously, characters who are used in a turn cannot be used again later on to attack (if it is your turn) or defend (if there is another House on the attack!)

A player who has the highest total "initiative" ratings on the plot card and cards he controls won the initiative. He then selects one title from the game board. Each title confers different power to the players. For example, the Crown Regent adds 3 to the strength of player's participating characters in a "power" challenge. Master of Whispers adds 3 to the strength in any "intrigue" challenge. Lord Commander of the Kingsguard adds 3 to any "military challenge". Hand of the King adds 2 influence to the player at the time resolving events that yield characters' influence etc. Some kind of "predestined" politics is introduced as a result as one title may support or oppose to another by nature as shown on the game board itself. You cannot initiate challenge against another player who holds a title which you support by default of your own title. For example, Master of Laws supports Hand of the King while Crown Regent support or oppose no one. Master of Laws would oppose Master of Whispers, naturally. If Master of Laws won a "challenge" against Master of Whispers, an additional power would be rewarded for the House (the player).

After resolving the challenges, during "dominance" phase, the players calculate the total combined strength of all the played and standing characters remaining in front of him plus the amount of gold in the treasury. The player with the highest value wins the dominance this turn and claim 1 power for his House. All knelt cards stand again for the next round. But before the turn ends, a "taxation" phase is conducted by giving all the remaining gold tokens to the gold pool and titles back to the game board. Another turn begins and players continue to fight another day.

I felt the game is more than I can appreciate by playing just one game. But for now, I am definitely into the mood of The Game of Thrones again while Season 3 is running. The card art is awesome and the system confers an aura of the land of Westeros as each House has its own unique capabilities. For example, House Lannister is easier to build up a huge army strong on military to attack anyone. House Targaryen has many dragons to intimate anyone dares to challenge. Stark is a balanced House with many land creatures coming to assist the knights and ladies. Baratheon is a House that allied with many friends with intrigue - manipulating others. After all, it was House Baratheon who controlled the Iron Throne and the Court in the beginning.

Did I say Dreamblade would be my only foray into "live" collectible games? Well, Dreamblade is dead and I'm now playing AGoT CCG. I was pulled in by its interesting game play, move to the LCG format ("Living Card Game"), theme (big fan of the books), and highly regarded community of players. If you're going to try a CCG, this one is a worthy candidate.

UPDATE (Aug '08): Since I started playing this game eight months ago, it has dominated my game playing time. It. Is. Awesome. The group of players that meet up regularly in NYC is a friendly, mature bunch and makes a fun game a real treat to play.

UPDATE (April '10): Still going strong with this one. I play it more than any other game in my collection and there is still a group of regulars who meetup to play in NYC. The LCG "reboot" has put the game in a great spot.

Good game if only using the base game, although then it becomes boring and foreseeable. 
The new series of decks it only makes the game unbalanced unless you spend A LOT of money on every one of them.

Comments entered on 13 Dec 2010:

A Game of Thrones CCG/LCG is a card game where you attempt to play out the military, political, and power struggles of the characters from the A Game of Thrones universe. The two versions of the game vary greatly in their distribution methods and slightly in their gameplay, with the LCG offering more emphasis on the multiplayer aspect of the game.

I purchased the starter decks to the original release of the CCG version of the game. I had a chance to play the game a couple of times initially but because of the collectible nature of the game, was unable to really delve into it. There was also the issue of having opponents to play against. After working at FFG I was able to play quite a bit more during the Winter Edition block.

My kids have played all three of the LCG games currently available (Warhammer Invasion and Call of Cthulhu) and both seem to really enjoy playing this game. Especially as a 3-player multiplayer game.

With the introduction of the LCG model, I have purchased at least one of every card product offered and in the case of the core set, I purchased three of those.

Tentative 8, rating might rise.

Easily the most complex card game I have ever played.

Update: 

Now it's a 9. Plays as well with three as it does 4.

Update:

It's a 10. Simply the best multiplayer constructible game I've ever played. The more I dig into it the more I see that I didn't know. Everyone in our group that's played loves it.

Have lots of CCG and 1st Edition LCG for trade.  If you are looking to build an awesome cube to draft with, or simply collect the cards, I can hook you up.  I will be keeping one copy of each card for my own cube draft, but the rest are available.

1 core set, Kings of the Seas and Princes of the Sun

My goal was to make a set of 6 playable / even decks that can be played and enjoyed by random friends.  ie make this into a  "board game" instead of ever expanding LCG 

Missing the original box.  I needed to compact this when I was moving back to the states after living overseas.

This has a Magic the Gathering feel but in the Game of Thrones universe.  I have not played multiplayer but seems like it is well designed for multi-player.  You put out characters for your house, locations, armaments, and play an initial plot card which affects rules for that round.  

You have three different types of attacks.  I really like the game, it is a lot of fun.  But is does run long for what it is.

Played twice - 1 2-player and 1 4-player.  Group liked it but it was a little slow going at first to get the phases down and the rules.  Could have been the late hour making everyone "slow" as well.

Having played the hobo version, I prefer this. I like the way the cards interact - with the hobo I felt like some cards just didn't do very much but with this it is all over the place.

I wanted to like it more but it just seems so fiddly some times and the gameplay takes a while.  Played a game of 4 one time and it felt like it was going on forever. We ended up not finishing.  Played a game 2 and the same thing happened.  It just drags on forever.

8/2012 Very good collectible card game without the money drain attribute. There's a good game flow and the theme and mechanics fit very well; characters and locations can be identified from, and are complemented by, the story the game is based upon.

3/2013 There's depth, variety, skill and cunning; all elements of a good game - in a CCG!? This is my FantasyFlight LCG of choice. Rating up 8->9.

RATING: 5
Similar to Magic the Gathering, but with a Game of Thrones theme, and accommodating up to 4 players. Sounds exciting. In practice, the game took waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long. Even once a player has built a comfortable position and is likely to win, it takes ages to actually earn 15 victory points.

The game box wins two awards: most ridiculously oversized box, and most impractical box, I have ever seen for a board game. The box has dimensions, in cm: 29.5 x 29.5 x 7.5, for a total volume of 6.5 litres. It contains four decks of 55 cards, for a total volume of 0.1 litre, fit into a very impractical insert. The box is literally 65 times too large for its content. A "small card game"-sized box would have been much more appropriate.

The upper half of the box is slightly too tight, and the outside of the box is coated with a very rough painted paper of some sort, so the upper half of the box doesn't slide very well on the bottom half of the box. To this date I have never managed to close the box completely.

Adding insult to injury, the cards don't fit back into the cardstock insert once they have been unwrapped. The insert has holes for the cards to fall through, and rough edges and corners that damage the cards.
The insert also happens to fill all the box, so even if I found a way to fix it, it would not be possible to add expansion cards without getting rid of the insert altogether... At which point all the cards would be loose in the gargantuan box.

Did I mention there was nothing to hold the tokens (cardboard coins and victory points) once they have been unpunched? I added a freezer plastic bag, and it is now loose under the insert.

I HATE this box. This is like someone took a course of board game box design, and applied the knowledge to build the worst game box possible.

RATING: 5
Based on two 4-player games (both of which bogged down so badly that I was forced to abandon after 90 mins). Some good elements, but *very* fiddly to learn due to loads of unique card text and clearly will only shine once thoroughly familiar with all/the majority of the cards. For me it didn't seem really enjoyable enough to warrant this time investment.

Across the Seven Kingdoms, the Great Houses of Westeros struggle to control the Iron Throne. The battle begins here in the A Game of Thrones Core Game.
The beloved heroes, villains, locations, and events of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire saga come to life in this customizable card game. Players take control of the Starks, Baratheons, Lannisters, or Targaryens and attempt to plot, fight, conspire, manipulate, and bribe their way to victory.

Only played a handful of times but am really enjoying it so far.  I like all the deck-building possibilities.  I think this game has a lot of potential, but only if you're willing to commit to learning all the rules and nuances (that's not really a complaint; it's just that some people will prefer a simpler game).  

I think I'll enjoy this more when I spend a bit more time learning the rules, the flow of the game, and all the keywords.  

[i][b]Update:[/b] I decided to sell because I'd collected too much, too quickly, without playing much!  However, I kept a core set (and chapter pack cycle 2, because I accidentally didn't include that in the auction).

I enjoy this game quite a bit, but without expansions it loses a lot in the replayability department.  Plus, for me personally, having to construct a deck only eats into my play time and can significantly swing the balance for experienced versus new player of this game.  I guess, in my old age, CCGs and LCGs just aren't for me anymore.

I have the feeling this game only makes sense with 3-4 players. However, it suffers the fate of many direct conflict games with 3-4 players fighting each other: At any point you can be beaten down by the other players if they collaborate, and the winner is determined mostly by the guy that is not attacked much by the others (in contrast to the guy that played smart).

A Game of Thrones the Card Game was the alternative to Magic that hooked me. 
Yes, the game is slower than Magic, and yes, the rules are more complicated, but the LCG model is an improvement on the insanity that is the CCG and the game has one thing which makes it so much more to my liking : proper player interaction.
Where in most card games player interaction limits itself to Take That type actions, in aGoT there are many cards that are specifically made for alliances in a three or four player game. I like the political flavoring this brings to what could have been just another card game.

I think if I had been a fan of the theme, I may have stuck with it more, but as such, I have not read the books or watched the TV show.

What I liked:
- The 3 different types of challenges means that focusing entirely on one type of attack won't win you the game
- Each house offers some variety in strategy

What I didn't like:
- I felt there weren't enough event cards you could play to bring some unknowns into combat resolution.
- Combat resolution was mostly deterministic, so most of the time, you're deciding which losing option is the best (do I lose this challenge unopposed so I still have standing characters, or do I kneel a character and lose so that it's unopposed?)
- Unopposed challenges encourages beating on the weakest
- Gameplay can get long

After 1 play with Stark vs Lannister:  Interesting out of the box, but some complex interactions are apparent which will take a few games to get down - a solid 7 and may go higher with further plays.  

Common criticism is that the starting decks are a bit random and lack enough of the core power cards to make a reliable deck, such that a second core set will really help with the  decks. Can't see me getting into LCG building, so the most I would buy is another core set, unless I want to grab a the greyjoy and martell boxes down the track.

Great theme. Love the multiplayer... Unfortunately the timing was convoluted and far too many vague and confusing rules. Too many card games are ruined by unclear rules... That seems to be the main flaw in the " cards rewrite the rules" style games.

Cruelty and backstabbing are at the core of the games themes but unfortunately the vague rules created too much real world tension and hostility for me to stick with this game.

Fun and interesting 2p duel game with lots to think about and fun deck-construction. My favourite of the LCGs so far since the combat mechanic is very interesting with the different houses scoring separately.

Intriguing multiplayer CCG.   I think Magic (and the old Decipher Star Wars CCG) is a far far better game for the 2player, but this is promising on the multiplayer front.  Unsure how many of the expansions will be needed to make decks beyond the starter.  

I think there might be a pretty good game here, but I am unsure if I am willing to give it the multiple plays/exploring that is needed to develop a feel for deck strategy.  

The initial multiplayer game will feel like it is a bit long for what it is, but I think is to be expected with any CCG, especially, if a few of the players have little CCG experience.  The brief FFG tutorial videos are pretty good and I encourage new players to give them a brief review.

Game will have appeal to anyone that has read the books as each house does a decent job of capturing the feel and it is neat to see characters appearing out of the books.

Moritz really likes it which means it is almost for certain deserving of a few more plays.

Not bad, but nothing special. The 3 different types of attacks in the game are interesting, and this is where the meat of the game seems to be. You want to determine which attacks you want to use, figure out what your opponent will use to respond to which attack and thus which order you should do them, etc. It's neat, but it didn;t always translate into fun for me. Worst is, the game always felt like it ran longer than it should. It's a classic "40 minutes of fun in a 90 minute game" situation. Everytime I played, I though "not bad, but I would have rather played 2 or 3 games of Innovation or Dominion." London now occupies the "90 minute card game" slot much more capably.

One game as Stark, one as Targaryen - both were two player games. Maybe this game shines as a four player game, but as a two-player, it felt uneven, even viciously unbalanced. Will have to try it as a four player to see if it improves.

Very thematic "living card game".  Each player plays a house and must abide by shifting allegiances to the other houses while having lots of opportunity for ruthless revenge.  It really captures the theme of the books well.

This game would be a 10 for me if it avoided the same traps that collectible games set.  The prebuilt decks have glaring weaknesses that are not fun, but additional cards are offered in chapter packs to fix these faults.

If complete decks were released 3-4 times a year without glaring weaknesses or the option to "fix" decks with additional collectible cards, the living card format would be a winner for me.  

I try not to play this game now, because I have battled addictions to collectible games in the past.  NO FUN!!

Довольно сложная игра. Проблема в том, что в игре находятся одновременно много карт с разными свойствами. Свойства - довольно длинные (по сравнению, с MtG, например). Уместить всё это в голове довольно трудно. Поэтому частенько ходы затягиваются, особенно поначалу. Нужно несколько раз сыграть, прежде чем освоишься с картами и поймёшь что к чему.
Как и в книжке, персонажи здесь долго не живут. Такую кровавость надо иметь в виду прежде чем садиться играть с девушками или с детьми.
Зато, у этой игре есть огромное преимущество относительно остальных ККИ/ЖКИ: возможность играть вчетвером!

Reminds me a lot of Magic: The Gathering, but it's much longer and can be played with more people. Got rid of this one because it's difficult to get a good group together to play this one with. If you can get past the length, complexity, and sub-standard characters from the base set, there's actually a really fun game in here. Second only to LOTR in terms of all the Fantasy Flight LCGs.

UPDATE: I've returned to this version after the disappointing second edition. This game is probably the best stand-alone LCG Fantasy Flight has ever done. Can get pretty fiddly as the game goes along, however, with keeping track of all the abilities of characters and locations in play.

RATING: 7
Evolution of Magic the Gathering with a couple of innovations.  First, mana flood/screwage is replaced by a single currency to buy characters/events.  Second, there are three types of conflicts that can result in either the elimination of an opponent's character, forcing the opponent to discard a card, or stealing one of the opponent's victory points.  The best part of the game involves the simultaneous selection of plot cards that determine how much gold you have to buy characters/events, who goes first, and provides a special power.  Down a couple of points because there are not as many decisions as other LCGs.  Down another point because many event cards have obscure use and end up just being held as potential bait in case you are forced to discard.

RATING: 7.5
Fantastic game when played in a melee format (3-4 players). I originally gave it a lower score as I had only played the 2 player format Joust. However playing the multiplayer version, playing with titles, making enemies and friends, it really did the Game of Thrones title justice. 

The Rulebook wasn't ideal in teaching me all I needed to know, especially due to the fact that there are a lot of keywords not covered. However if you've every played Magic: The Gathering, this won't be to hard to get the hang of.

Only other downside is I wish the game had cooler art on the back of the cards because I love the art on the front. haha, a horrible downside because I sleeve my decks!

Super great game.
Great customization options.
Excellent intrigue.

In this "living card game" in which you can buy all possible cards in a box, players play the various houses from the George Martin novels. Similar to Magic:The Gathering, you play cards out of your hand which cost gold. Your gold is set by the plot card you choose, which also detemines initiative (highest initiative choses who goes first in which phase). 

Character cards have strength values in military/intrigue/power. Players are allowed one attack in each of those attributes. 

The goal of the game is to earn 15 power tokens. The twist is that you choose titles before playing cards, and some titles support others, so you may not be able to attack someone else. Some other titles are opposed to others, in which your rewards are doubled. 

The game box says 1-2 hrs. This game is a notch below games like Race for the Galaxy or Magic:The Gathering. It's a bit longish for a card game. Some plot cards appear to be very destabilizing, for a game of this length. It's okay, I have onl played once, but would be willing to try again to see the depth in the game.

Very good game although it becomes truly good if you buy a second core set and some expansions.
I play a lot of lcgs but this one has the worst starting decks by far... they really don't give you any feel for play and it keeps coming to mind that this is horribly incomplete...
If you are willing to invest in a game and like epic "battles" then go ahead and buy it,if not there are many great ones like Android: Netrunner, Warhammer Invasion (and the warhammer 40000 conquest coming)...
Big kudos to the designers for the multiplayer and 2v2 modes. I never get bored with them and also can't recall any game in these mode where i thought it was bad!

Played twice now.  I like this game, but haven't quite gotten a handle on mechanics.  Decks in the box seem kind of sparse and ill fitting.  Need customization (a good marketing ploy on FFG's part for the expansions).  I like the non-random LCG card distribution format, however. Less emphasis on collecting, more on building strong decks and playability.

A tentative rating for the moment.

I know nothing about the books or TV show.  I am a fan of CCG's and really like the LCG format.

So far, all of my games have been with the core decks.  This set, so far, meets all of the challenges present in deck building games.  There are no rares.  The preset decks are really well balanced.  Each deck/family plays differently, so I don't feel like I'm just changing the card color.  Timing issues are pretty straightforward, though, from the FAQ's available, it looks like expansions will complicate this.  Card text makes sense and is reasonably consistent.

All of my games have been in joust format (1 on 1), but it seems like this game would work really well in multi-player format.  That would be a really awesome achievement for a CCG.

Lots of CCG fun in an non-collectible format.

Why this is not a 10:
-> I do not want to play this all the time

You'd probably better play this regularly and often, or not at all. So many cards, so confusing, total information overload, especially with 4 players - though, with 4 players it's more fun. The game is rather difficult to learn, not rules-wise, but it's crucial and hard to memorize the options available to your opponents, since all cards introduce special abilities. The information is very important and open, but factually invisible, because it is hardly possible to read the cards laid out in front of your opponents without taking them in your hands.

Great mechanics in this game.  It's also nice that you know exactly what you are getting into, as opposed to the format of TCGs. It usually takes longer than most CCGs, with a playtime of closer to an hour for each game when I have played. But it has several elements that really set it apart. First I really enjoy the combat system with the three different types of challenges. Second I think that plots are an amazing element that add a ton to the game. Third I enjoy how the game treats unique versus non-unique characters, and as a fan of the books and the show I think that the characters and their personalities really come through in the cards.

RATING: 7
I've only briefly dabbled in the core set to get a feel, but it's got all the standard FFG card game attributes and terminology so experience in any of the others lets you know what you're getting in this one. The initial games will be inevitably slow as you're getting to grips with all the effects in your hand and their best use. After that, the major decisions are what to attack with and what to hold back to defend with. There's three attacks you can make a turn - to kill people, to gain power tokens (you need these to win) or to force a player to discard - but they all work the same (add up strength, most wins). So it seems to be more a game of political judgement on who to attack and in what mode, what will go through, what I need to hold back and the like. I liked it enough to know I'd enjoy exploring and playing it more, but not enough to invest in.

Based on one play: At four players the game is really long. Turn order plays a huge part and there are so many intricacies that you can spend all your time just reading all the effects of your cards and others. I'm not a fan of games where you can have an advantage by memorizing all the cards. If you enjoy this type of card gaame (Magic comes to mind) but don't want to spend the money bying boosters, then you may enjoy it.

The problem with this game is too fold. First off the developers/designers failed to consider so many broken combos in the game that the errata got so long it was just stupid. the second is that you got in there and spent hundreds on the game then they reload it. If you can't get it right the first time then why would I buy back in a second time?

RATING: 6
Like many games of this sort, this is the type of game that you have to play a lot, or you may be frustrated.  There are tons of cards in this game, each has its own game text, and you really need to know what all of them do (yours and your opponent's) if you want to do well at the game.  Additionally, some cards have loaded keywords that aren't explained on the card; I really wish there was a player aid to help me figure out what these meant (there were too many to remember on the first play).  As a game, you were trying to earn points that you got from initiating battles against other players, which seemed fairly standard for a non-elimination combat game.  I'm not sure it really evoked the feeling of the novels, though.

One of the few games I've given away voluntarily!

Components and art are nice
Mechanics seem clean
This is the only (I think) out-of-the-box LCG by FFG that offers multiplayer games (i.e. 3-5) and not just 2 player duels as the others in the format do.

The use of 'offices' forces conflict between players that otherwise perhaps wouldn't be in direct competition.

Played once or twice and games were interesting but I have one too many LCGs now that I can't justify additional costs.

This was a rollercoaster. First of all 1v1 is the only way I'll consider playing. 4 players was unbearable. The game has a problem with expanding boards.

Like Magic, but more complex, strategic, and financially accessible. Rules and timing are esoteric at BEST. Many times, official rulings on card interactions defy all conventional logic or expectations. Expect to lose 1 game in 3 to an obscure ruling you had no clue was the case, unless you are devoted to reading large gobs of supplemental material, including regularly updated FAQs, Banned/Restricted lists, and errata.

Has a lot similar to Call of Cthulhu LCG but still this is a complete different game with a different feel and gameplay. Works perfectly even with two but better with more than two.

LCG format presents a sensible way to get into card gaming business. Gets my total support!

It's funny when I hear people talking about this and that card game being the "best" and almost EVERY TIME... they've never tried AGOT the Card Game.  I've tried them all, this game IS the "best".  It's amazing actually.  You play the cards, the cards don't play you... something I feel every other card game has to some degree -- lack of control.  This game is the opposite of lack of control because of plot cards which dictate game states or actions each turn.  Plots are amazing. And agendas!  Oh agendas!  Agendas further modify your game state to suit a certain style or goal -- amazing!  Too many people playing with agendas for your taste?  Great, there are cards that give you benefits if you don't play with an agenda and your opponent does.  Fun mind games!  Unlike other card games, if you lose in A Game of Thrones, is wasn't from some small chance of bad luck -- you just got outplayed.

Good deck building game, better than Call of Cthulhu for the following reasons: more uniformed phases with most events concentrated at the challenge phase (less chaos), money instead of domains makes it easier to get your cards out, playing only 1 faction seems to fit the theme better.
The only two downsides of this game is the fact that cards are text intensive with their own unique little exceptions which can make knowing all your opponents as much as your deck a steep learning curve. Also, money to build you're deck is very expensive.

RATING: 7.5
Definitely requires four people to play. I would imagine that with some expansions and some deck building time you can figure out good decks for two people, but I would not get the base set unless you plan to have four people in it or you want to build your own full decks to play against other people. I will probably pick up the base expansion to complete the six houses (four are included in the core set) and then a couple minor expansions for variety and leave it at that. I do play most games with my wife and kids and so I don't put a lot of weight on getting every expansion. Lastly, now that I mention kids, some of the cards theme might be a bit offensive or just material not suited for kids. e.g. "Double blackmail" or "Lannister Brothel". Again, nothing terribly bad, but probably something that you might have a hard time explaining to a young audience.

This game might have more conflict in it than any game I have ever played.  Much like the book there is a lot of conniving and backstabbing.  Some of the rules aren't incredibly clear.  Despite there being several aides to assist in this, it is fairly complicated.

Game can be slow at times and is very prone to paralysis by analysis.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
To be fair, two of the guys seemed to really love this, but for me CCG/LCG's don't work. AGoT seemed very messy, with too many cards strewn around the table, small icons, too much text on each card and, worst of all, too much hard work looking at other player's decks to see what everyone is up too. I really couldn't be bothered, particularly as there seemed to be plots and events that had to be remembered each turn. I will play it again, hopefully a lot faster than we managed, but I fear this type of game just doesn't rev my engines.

I own the Core Set. Very good game, but difficult for new people to learn. 

Several members of my group borrowed this and played it literally dozens of times subtlety tweaking their decks to perfection. I jumped back in to play a few times after they did this and got my face ground into the dirt. Frustrating to say the least, but I guess that's kind of the nature of this game. Unfortunately I'm not willing to put the time and energy into this to get to their level.

The game design here is actually pretty brilliant. Perhaps one of the best card games I've played. That being said, it is very readily apparent which players are less advanced. Building a proper deck can be tricky business and the starter decks that come with the base game are junk. You'll need to invest a decent amount of money before you have a deck that's fun to play with.

Once you and a few friends are operating on the same level, this game has a ton of potential. Definitely get at least 4 people together though, as the intrigue of teaming up with various players is much more interesting than the simple 1 vs 1 game.

RATING: 7
Thrones is a fantastic concept of a game that is ham strung by ages of inconsistent card design and balancing issues. Typos and an over reliance on FAQing its way out of mistakes strongly drag it down, as does it's completely abstruse timing structure. Still, the concept is fantastic

Played both melee and joust now. I can see a lot of potential here, though it'll take some time and effort to bring it out. Nice flavour and variety in the cards. The houses certainly have different feel and play styles. Game is more tactical than strategic, and each turn feels like something of a puzzle. But I can see how the multifaceted struggle with tuned decks could generate real drama. Looking forward to exploring further.

I love this game; however, its complexity and demands on time for deck building purposes makes it somewhat niche.

I think that any further purchases will be limited to big box expansions and maybe some more chapter packs for flavour.

This game. Unlike netrunner, all I bought was the base game and I do not intend to buy anything else for it. This is a long, brain burning game that will pull at your heartstrings. That means it's really, really good. One of my favorite fully competitive games. 

Theme is of course wonderfully executed. Feels very much like the books.

RATING: 7.1
Nothing wrong with the gameplay. Odd how the challenges for one player are done completely before the opponent gets to challenge. Makes for a n interesting decision-making time, but I don't see it as very fun when you get slammed 3 times in a row if bad luck in the cards. Losing the gold for taxation was a stupid rules they could've just added to the standing phase e.g. "Stand all characters, items and locations, discarding all gold to the treasury, if any are in your possession."

I like the living card game format, but this is not the game I would live through. Still waiting for some game that immerses me in the gameplay and card abilities.

On the odd side, I liked it better than Lord of the Rings LCG, that one didn't feel like LotR at all.

A very deep and thoughtful game that is tons of fun to play, especially with 4 person melee.  Every game is different, and as you build your cards to combat one strategy you may open yourself up to others.  Playing in a meta is fantastic.

Initial rating after just a couple of joust plays. This thing is good. The core set alone is fun, and I can only imagine the deck building would be excellent.

More plays and this is still impressive.

In order to reflect the essense of the novel, a Card Game is way better than a Diplomacy Game. So many characters, locations, weapons and events to excite you.

Love the game, 2 player is very fun as it is. But when you get 4 players it adds other dimension to the game like backstabbing and playing gold to do challenges to another player(littlefinger version). Cards are mostly represented well from the fire and ice book series. I highly recommend it to any Game of Thrones fans and those who like card games that have similar mechanics.

2nd edition is coming out so if you are wanting to get into the game competitively you might want to wait till then. For those that just want to play it recreationally you can wait for the 2nd edition or get the current version; both are viable and will be fun to play.

Looking to buy or trade for more cards for GoT LcG.

Für mich der Zenit der Kartenspielbemühungen von Fantasy Flight Games. Ein komplexes, aber bei näherer Betrachtung trotzdem sehr elegantes Spielsystem wird gemischt mit einem tollen Thema und einer mittlerweile beachtlichen Kartenvielfalt. Das Deckbauen macht einen Heidenspaß und erlaubt sehr viele funktionierende Decks.
Das eigentliche Spiel gefällt mir um Welten besser als beispielsweise der Urvater "Magic", weil weniger statisch und ohne die nervige Land-Spielerei.

Played at TABScon March 2009.

Was a good learning experience, but my Magic background really helped me learn the mechanics.  Would definitely be better with waaay more exposure to the cards and repeated play.  However, the "semi-collectable" nature of the cards and decks definitely precludes me from participating.  I don't begrudge FF making money but I won't give them any for this effort.  Still, the cards and mechanics are nice.

There's no way this game is "playable" without expansions.

As a wargamer who is interested in the George R.R. Martin universe, I had fairly high expectations for this one.  Unfortunately, the gameplay struck me as both simple and clunky, and the cards end up generating rules questions that you don't ever see in, say, a run of the mill CDG game, as there is very little gameplay that does not derive straight from the often opaque card text.  Not sure if this is a weak example of the LCG genre or if the whole concept isn't for me.

Simultaneously pick a Plot Card that sets some abilities for your round. Play cards, either Characters (the meat), Locations (global upgrade), or Attachments (upgrades for characters). Characters fight each other in 3 arenas of conflict (military - kill characters, intrigue - discard cards, power - steal power), being tapped when used. Compare standing characters for majority (1 power reward). Rinse and repeat until somebody gets 15 power.

Brimming with the keyword overload that introduces 'artificial' rule complexity to customizable card games. The ordinary, stolid mechanisms (e.g. 3 arenas of conflict with only consequences being different) don't provide an incentive to get over the keywords.

Not tried 2er, but runaway leader problem is a concern. Seems like at the pro level, it's all about the pre-game (deck construction) and hoping for the early help to step on the accelerator for a big early lead, which doesn't appeal to me.

Customizable card games shy away from multiplayer, and for good reason (keyword overload to the power of n). This game embraces it, with nice touches like every card being multiplayer-compatible (instead of shoe-horning into 4er when it isn't designed for it) and the Small Council. But the total chaos flying around the table was too much, almost like a Munchkin-style knife-fight, and it took way too long (more than 2 hr 30 min before we mercy-killed it). This should be mitigated with experience and better/faster decks, but again, keyword overload is not something I particularly want to get into. There's also a lot of card complexity and keeping abilities straight that distracts from a Munchkin-style diplomacy game, if that's what you're into.

I like what it did with the theme. Everybody dies ([i]valar morghulis[/i]), so don't fall in love with any combo you build. Unfortunately, that hurts the game a bit, since you can't count on building a good combo, so every round is like starting over, and Round 7 plays the same as Round 1 (except the leader-bashing might be against somebody else). 

3+2

Left in Canada.
This is one of the most thematic card games I've ever played. The developers understand the world and the characters to the point where the game oozes with flavour. Despite this ode to theme, the game is also surprisingly tight as a competitive game. Multiplayer also works brilliantly. The rules can be a bit of mess and the barrier to entry can be quite high in terms of learning curve and costs (if you want to be competitive) but I think the investment is worth it. Core sets are cheap and even if you stop at that your investment will net you a lot of fun that will leave you wanting to dive right into the deckbuilding aspect.

A good game, with rather distinctive and solid mechanics, and able to evoke the spirit of Westeros struggles (though at a very abstracted level). Where the game falls a bit short is in a few details: why is Ed Stark one of the character who hardly ever dies and always comes back into play (one would imagine the opposite)? Why can;t Asha Greyjoy be saved? (here, I must be missing something). Quirks, really, but, along with the general abstraction of the game concept, enough to make me downgrade it 1 mark.

[b]Note: These comments apply to the core set, as is, with no deck building[/b]

I actually like this game and think there is a cool system with some nice Game of Thrones flavor, but it struggles to find its place

4 player works surprisingly well, but it's too long. Power tokens are introduced slowly into the system and you need a lot to win -- combine that with leader bashing, and you have a guaranteed long game on your hands. To justify the length, there needs to be more actual development, but the reality of the brutality of this game system means that by round 7 you can still feel like you're running on a hamster wheel so it starts to feel repetitive, even if you are slowly making progress toward the goal.

However, I don't see shortening the game as justifiable, because there actually are ways to swing 5-6 power in a single turn, so the game could end way too fast without the players being able to develop their decks, and not getting to cycle through a bunch of fun Westeros stuff pretty much ruins the point...

2 player is also longer than you'd expect because of the slowness of power being introduced into the system, and though there are tough decisions abound about how and when to play your cards and whether or not to use them or save them for defense or domination, the combat does often boil down to arithmetic, though with enough complexity to make it a hard enough call for what the "right" thing to do is to still give it some tough decisions. 

Biggest problem with 2 player though is thatthe runaway leader problems can be ridiculous. Falling behind in military means you fall behind in everything else because your cards will only last a single turn.

So what about 3 player? Is it the happy medium? I don't know, but the rulebook listing 3 player as a VARIANT doesn't inspire much confidence.

[hr]Saw some threads that convinced me to try specific deck-builds with 2x core sets, so I gave it a shot

Better decks did indeed improve the flow of the game, and I was able to see more decision making and less runaway-leader (though one mistake can still be crippling, but that's fine in a contest of skill). Game also seems to go quicker with more competent decks that are able to accomplish their goals more easily.

Rating raised.

I'm not sure about this game after one play.  There were some things I liked.  It has a definite MtG flavour to it and seems to be cleaner and more streamlined.  But there was also a few things I didn't like.  Some nasty, spiteful cards (I guess that goes with the theme?).  The starting decks seemed to be a little unbalanced (one person had 15-20 cards on the table and another person had 5 at one point).  I also think that the deckbuilding aspect that works great in the Lord of the Rings card game is not as much fun in a competitive game (unless all the players buy into it).  I will admit that I'm not familiar with the books or TV show so the theme was not really a draw for me at all.

This is a clever game, but it's completely buried under its own weight at this point.  The myriad of rules exceptions, complications and interactions has reached "spaghetti" code status.   There is no way to play this game other than to spend all your time on it.  I've collected three copies of every card that has come out since the LCG re-boot.  I'm just trying to figure out a good time to sell them all in one shot to a wannabe collector of this game and get it out of my closet.

Absolutely BEAUTIFUL art and components.  Most likely the most gorgeous card game I've seen to date.  The game itself is okay.  I felt like it's just saturated with stages and it's just so complicated and involved.  You really need to know exactly what other cards people have and what they do, so perhaps after a number of plays I could see enjoying the game more, but with the length of play with four players I'm not sure I'm going to be playing it that much.  Still, for fans of card combat games, it's excellent.

Хотелось, чтобы в коллекции была одна ККИ, но лотерею не люблю))), я не настолько богат для этого), поэтому выбор падал на ЖКИ, которых также немало. Так как "Песнь Льда и Огня" Дж. Мартина мне очень понравилась, то ЛКИ по этой вселенной заняло место у меня на полке). Недостатки и плюсы этой игры такие же, как у любой ЖКИ: большое количество карт, которые надо запомнить, большое количество ньюансов в правилах. Есть очень приятное отличие от стандартной схемы: играть можно и втроем, и вчетвером, выбирая к тому же титулы (роли) для каждого раунда, в остальном всё похоже. В общем, эта игра доставит удовольствие только тем, кто с ней знаком (не только с правилами, но и картами) и хочет потратить часок-другой на неё (в случае, когда карты неизвестны и ньюансы правил неясны время партии можно смело умножать на два). Что очень хорошо в ней, так это то, что атмосферу книг Мартина передает игра очень здорово: просто погружаешься в мир интриг, борьбы за власть и господство, в мир семи королеств Вестероса, представленных в базовой комплектации 4-мя домами.
Оценка за сеттинг (ККИ-ЖКИ) -2, оценка за атмосферу +1, итого - 4 балла))). Качество локализации хорошее, зато не очень хорошеее качество перевода книги правил, правда и в оригинале она "муторная", но в оригинале есть FAQ, а оф. локализации этого обширного документа нет. Так что 4 балла с натяжкой за исполнение)).

A favorite of mine. I play casually only, mainly with my wife, sometimes with friends. With 2 core sets and the deluxe expansions "Princes of the sun" and "Kings of the sea", I built 6 decks, one per family, using the deck suggestions on CardGameDB. 

The game can be swingy or completely one-sided, depending on the card draw and your strategy, so you need to accept that the game may not appear to be fair. With repetitive play and knowledge of your cards though, you can become quite effective. I surprised my opponents more than once with my favorite house, Martell, and its "lose to win" strategy. 

I love the books, love the TV series, and sure enough love this game. The theme is a bonus, however, to mechanics I really appreciate. 

EDIT 2017-04-10 : Down to 7.5. Still a good game, but with repeated plays, has become a bit frustating. Once you start loosing a game, it generally is a one-sided affair from this point on.

Rating is for initial impression for a learning game with core starter decks, Lannister vs Stark, on OCTGN. Took a while to learn the game, the interface, and the cards.  System is interesting, if not especially clean.  Might have rated it higher if I hadn't played Android: Netrunner some before checking it out.

Played it again, again with the core set (Baratheon vs Targaryen), and I liked it less.  Takes to long to play, and the card powers interact with the rules in really unclear ways.  It felt like we spent too much of the time looking up how something was supposed to interact.  I am fairly sure I would HATE this game in multiplayer, and the 2-player game has deficiencies.  I may be done with it.

Excellent theme play.  Game is difficult to learn and play.  This game is a brain burner and too complicated.  A player has to constantly think about how an action will affect later rounds as the cards can affect two or three other things.  I found play to be frustrating in this respect because I fight so hard to gain an advantage in one phase only to give it right back to my opponent in the next phase without him doing anything.  The multiplayer version is interesting with the added alliances that can be forged per turn.  The components are excellent - thick chits durable cards with nice artwork.  Game time is very long and seems to drag.

The central gameplay is minblowingly good, so it's a real shame that the card design is deliberately messy and unbalanced, just to make you buy into the collectible aspect. 

Having said that, there's excellent value in the core box. Factions are not so well balanced initially, but some deck tweaking can fix this. If you are willing to spend money on deckbuilding (and you can find opponents that feel the same), then AGOT LCG is great. 

However, If you plan to play this "like a boardgame", then I would suggest you just avoid it entirely. Don't be fooled by the LCG format - it's pretty much the same as CCGs, it's still the same old arms race. 

It's a shame that the collectible format has crippled yet another promising game.

Tried the 4p game. Immediately the drawbacks of this game became clear: too much text. Too much stupid little rules (you cannot attack, you should attack, hey that means he can't attack me so I should target him etc etc) pop up immediately. Why they have put 4p as the learning game is beyond me.

Followed up with a 2p game and found it ok. Still a mess at times but with the roles out of the way, more of the game itself is allowed to come forward. Still find too much text on each card, no deckbuilding with 'just' a base set and it still suffers from serious AP problems.

That being said, the theme is very good, factions are varied and the text and rule problems wear off after repeating play.
What remains is a steep learning curve, a money pit sinkhole and a game that is almost impossible to 'casually' play. Meaning: once in a while against someone also not knowing every card nor spending big bucks on it.

Will try out a bit more but this is seriously looking at the 'For Trade' pile, together with all character decks I have with it (Sacred Bonds and Ancient Enemies).

2p game: games tend to 'flip' quickly towards one side or the other, and -besides the armageddon cards that f.e. kill all other characters- no elegant way to claw back. As a result, games become boring towards the end. Of course, this will be mitigated by deckbuilding but not willing to sink €100s of euros into a game to fix a very basic design flaw.

Set for trade, including my expansion packs.

This is going to take a few plays to be able to rate fairly. There are certainly a lot of interesting aspects to the game; the choices as to whom to use to attack, which attack to initiate, who to hold back etc. The overwhelming amount of text is a major issue without constantly playing the same decks. Something a competitive LCG seems to actively not want to happen...

It seems to be that players are forced to have to approximate the relative strengths of each opponent which seems odd considering the (vast majority of) cards are face up on the table.

Since it's mixed in with a bunch of the expansions, I'll ignore them for the purposes of rating and logging plays

Update: After three full plays, and about 9 hours, I like a lot of parts of this game, but many of the keywords seemed largely unnecessary (Stalwart?) and there are really too many abilities scattered across the table to keep track of (we had 70 cards on the table at one point, shortly after I'd lost a lot of my cards to a series of military attacks. That is TOO MANY cards to keep track of).

For theme, interesting choices and fun to play, this is probably a high 8. It loses a point for fantasy art, a couple for taking over three hours to play one of our games, and a few more for having to track so many cards. It then gains some back for the interesting roles which go some way to balance the game. Balance is an odd word in this instance. I think it's possibly balanced in the same way I hear Innovation is; everything is massively swingy and imbalanced to such an extent that everything is overpowered. And so none of it is overpowered...

Further update: I've now played a few times with the base decks and oh my, does this make the game more playable. Far fewer key words; a faster, smoother game. The main downside is the repetition of cards across decks but I suppose that increases playability/accessibility. Here begins now, then, my attempt to build 4 balanced, varied decks which maintain simplicity and don't extend game play...

Rating up from 6.6 to 8.

Very good game mechanics, and the 3 different challange types and their different game effects are nice. All of the playable fractions in the game (the noble houses of Westeros) have their own strengths and weaknesses, and therefore require different tactics/strategies to win.

RATING: 5
I really enjoyed this game as a game, but am scared off of actually playing it any more because of the introduction of deckbuilding and money as a strategy.  You can take the word collectible out of it all you want to, but the person that spends more money is going to always be more powerful than the person that spends less.

The game has many options and is quite interactive.  I think a lot of guys at OMGA would really like this one, but I don't want to pick it up.  And if anyone really liked it and started buying their own stuff, it would hit the realm of CCG's that I hate and no longer want to be a part of.

Like any CCG game (pre-built deck or not) it take a little time with the cards to get a feel for your strengths and weaknesses. That being said, the core decks are nicely done and pretty balanced feeling (after one play). This is one of those that is fun enough to be worth spending the time to try and figure out through multiple playings. And if you figure it out quickly, there are a load of chapter packs out currently (and only going to be more) to delve into the deck building part of the game. 

The game seems a little more interesting 4-player than 2-player.

This is a game that feels very frustrating when you play it.  I'd say it's probably one of the most stressful games I've ever played.

It's a game that requires a lot of devotion, so if you don't have a lot of time to devote to it, it's best not to get into it.

This had some major potential in my eyes initially but now has waned some.

Horrible 3 player game and a five to six player game takes forever. WHich with my group it usually turns into the larger size.

Plus initially my group wanted no part with agendas or seasons....yet other houses had their special type of cards they could use.  This turned me off as a Stark player and there Agendas and winter not an option. THey have since seen my counter argument but my attitude towards the game was soured and not sure it will recover with the group.

Maybe at Gencon or something but then if its not something I played often then it would be like learning a new game every time I play it.

Really good idea with core set (and core expansions) making quite a good game. Endless new expansions make you feel like a filthy card whore, and a worthless consumer questioning the point of buying any more cards (I never bought outside core expansions).

I enjoyed trying this game and would be tempted to buy it if I didn't know that I'd feel compelled to buy all of the expansions, which I really don't want to do. It's also the type of game that would benefit from a regular opponent, which I don't see myself having for this game. I particularly enjoyed the game because I'm a fan of the novels on which it is based. I actually can't really see someone who is unfamiliar with the novels enjoying this game very much, unless they're a die-hard CCG fan. It was a well-designed and intricate CCG, not just a licensed product for the sake of a licensed product, but knowing the characters and events definitely contributed significantly to my enjoyment (then again maybe I'm just particular about that sort of thing since I couldn't enjoy the Battlestar Galactica board game until I'd seen the show, having tried it both beforehand and afterwards).

This is no longer a CCG, having transitioned to Fantasy Flight Games' new Living Card Game (LCG) format. Excerpts from FFG's "LCG: A Player's Guide" (available here: http://www.agameofthrones.com/news-lcg-guide.html ):

"A Living Card Game (LCG) is a game that breaks away from the traditional Collectible Card Game (CCG) model by offering a new fixed card distribution method that still offers the same dynamic customizable, expanding, and constantly evolving game play that makes CCG’s so much fun, but without the blind buy purchase model that has burned out so many players. The end result is an innovative mix that gives you the best of both worlds!

Whoa, this was quite horrible experience! TONS of text and rule breaking abilities in the cards and the play got quite confusing (and slow too). Of course it all will get easier after you know the game inside out, but there was nothing that would draw my interest to find out more... I thought that some elegance and spirit was definitely lacking.

This game seems to be very good. Infortunatly my first game was a four player game with three new players (including me).
It took 3h30 for a 12 points game.
To much for me, to many cards to many thing to check at the same time...
People who like Warhammer Invasion or game like that will surely love AGOT card game. But not me.
I think I won't play it again.

Great game. I made it board game style (3x decks of each House ready to go for Joust or Melee). I bought everything for a while, but I was never able to find a play group. Instead, I moved into Netrunner and Star Wars LCGs.

The mechanics of this game are perfect for the theme. The separation of challenges is also genius - do I attack your resources (ie hand) with intrigue, eliminate your board with military, or steal your win condition in a power struggle?

The plot deck is also a strength of the game. The plots provide the round's base income and provide various special powers to alter the game.

Vastly improved by 2nd edition rules.

I love the theme and the flavor. LCGs are getting a bit tainted on me though. Playing against your own decks usually isn't the most fun while trying to keep up with the game to occasionally go to the FLGS group nights is prohibitive in time and money. If you've got a group that is interested in investing - please have a blast!

Unfortunately, this game often leads to analysis paralysis depending on who you play with, which can make this game a bit boring. Also, try not to play it with only two players, as it is often unbalanced. Overall the rules are very interesting and it has earned its place among the best card games out there. And, of course, if you like the novel series A song of Ice and Fire or the TV series Game of Thrones, this is a very good choice.

WoW:TCG is the only similar game I've played, so I don't have much experience to use for rating this game.  If I met with friends to play a TCG/LCG, it would not be this one.  I just did not find the gameplay interesting.

I understand the draw of a LCG.  I find the collecting aspect of TCG (CCG) to be a shameful marketing ploy.  I hope LCG's do become popular, but I just didn't think this one was well written.

Also the "plot card" that tells all players to discard all heroes is just too chaotic.

Very fun card game, no "mana" problem with the plot deck. Fun with 3 or 4 players with the addition of titles that gives bonuses but keep you from attacking certain players. Three types of challenges that keep the game thematic. 
With many cards, can be quite long to build decks for quick play.

Across the Seven Kingdoms, the Great Houses of Westeros struggle to control the Iron Throne. The battle begins here in the A Game of Thrones Core Game.
The beloved heroes, villains, locations, and events of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire saga comes to life in this customizable card game. Players take control of the Starks, Baratheons, Lannisters, or Targaryens and attempt to plot, fight, conspire, manipulate, and bribe their way to victory.
\13\\13
The A Game of Thrones card game can be played in a multiplayer ''melee'' format with 3-4 players, or in a one-on-one ''joust'' format with 2 players. But whichever format you choose, the game has only just begun! In the world of the Living Card Game, hundreds of additional cards are available separately, allowing players to customize the four houses included here, or create entirely original decks.

I love some things about this, but others not so much.  It just seems so brutal (lots of resets), and, just like the Cthulhu LCG, so blatantly calculable.  There needs to be more uncertainty about outcomes, or it just boils down to who gets picked on the least.

But the biggest problem has nothing to do with the game, per se, but with the type of game it is: it's just not amenable to pick up and play; each player has to devote time to it or it suffers (it's more about deckbuilding than in-game decisions).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I wanted to like it so bad. I gave it a few tries with good decks built by an experienced player, so I'm not just rating the Core Set. Unfortunately the mechanics suck:

- there is no stack which to me is unforgivable in a modern card game.

- it almost got the resource mechanic right with the plot cards, almost. But it still also uses lands, as seen in MtG almost 20 years ago. For the record I think lands are the single mechanic that breaks MtG for me. If Magic had a good resource mechanic (like Warhammer Invasion for example) I would probably play it.

- multiple small creatures with red attack kill even the fattest guy thanks to sheer numbers. You can't "not block", you need to sacrifice creatures whenever you're hit with red.

- blocking causes creatures to tap.

If you don't mind all this stuff, or you have no idea what I am talking about then by all means give this game a try. I just have a vision of a perfect card game in my head, partially fulfilled by Warhammer Invasion (which unfortunately has broken cards released every month), and this game is just very different from this vision.

Ok, it's a good card game.
Unfortunately, it's not my kind of game.
Too many things to know, to read, to memorize, to keep in mind just to have the enginge of the game go on.
Too many cards in play at once.
But the mechanism is good, the theme is great: the different houses (well i just tried two) really have different aspects in line with the novels.
If i liked this kind of games, i'd love this.
Quite good art.

After playing Lord of the Rings LCG, Android: Netrunner, and Star Wars LCG, I really wanted to try Game of Thrones simply due to the theme, but after two very unbalanced solo games and two unbalanced face-to-face games, I was convinced that I wasn't going to enjoy this game without figuring out how to balance it. Additionally, the artwork is sub-par compared to all of the other LCGs.

I love the thrill of a card game, any card game. The thrill of not knowing exactly what the draw will be, how your strategy will play out. Thematic ccg's/lcg's really transport me into another world, and GoT does that in a good way. I have one minor quibble, and that's the fact that unique cards are only unique per player. So if I have Ned Stark in play you can still play him on your side as well. This really breaks immersion IMHO. It should have been designed like MECCG, where unique really means unique.

This game truly shines as a four player affair. For less than four though, the game struggles to find balance, and the social aspect that is so essential to the four player game is lost.

The are many levels of strategy to this game, and for those inclined to serious deck-building, you will be well rewarded for your time.

We own a couple of the cycles expansions but are finding it hard to keep up with the releases of expansions, so we probably will not be able to complete this collection.

It is a good and engaging game. So far played it mostly with 4 players and only with base set. 

As an standalone game it is good but not great. I see great potential in deck construction part of the game but I am not planing on spending more money on it.

I still need to see if the decks are properly balanced against each other (in 4 players games they work great but diplomacy is involved).

AGoT:TCG is very fun so far. I feel like some of the starter decks aren't balanced, but that could be the randomness of the decks - there is typically only one copy of each card. The decks aren't consistent in play.

This is an enjoyable LCG and is particularly interesting as it seems to be a rare one that is designed for and better with more than two players.  The bonus abilities and the way they effect who can attack who is interesting and trying to garner victory points by making unopposed attacks makes for some interesting strategies.  Not one I think I would ever buy but unlike most LCG's its one I am interested in trying again.

This game is hard to rate because we've had both good times and immense frustrations with it. Just learned today that we've been playing the keyword "Deadly" wrong since we started and the Stark player is sure to be annoyed about that. Basically, this game is incredibly non-intuitive both with regards to rules and when it comes to strategies. You start out thinking you're playing some multiplayer version of Warhammer: Invasion or whatever and end up realizing that you need to rethink every single strategy, tactic or goal you might have because they're all wrong. So that in itself makes it a good game (makes you think and use your head and all that) but at the same time the rules and the online FAQ (with it's "Moribound state" for 4 pages or something) are nearly unfathomable. I guess one day we might end up playing the game "properly" and it will be glorious but for now it's 50/50 annoying and good.

The best multiplayer cardgame. It requires a lot of thinking and has very good mechanics. There's a lot going on and many decisions to take:

There are plots to choose every rounds that alter the game, positions in the court that gives you a standing with other players, and then you also have to decide which kind of attacks you will do. It gets even more complicated since characters can have 3 different kind of attacks. All factions play different and feel flavourful. It captures the spirit of the books very well. This is without doubt the best Agot game for this reason. Much better then the boardgame. 

Minor points are : in 2 player I can imagine it looses much of it's goodness, though I always play multiplayer. There are a lot of cards on the table and it can become daunting to hold an overview. Some annoying decks to play against (chains & masters, Sansa attachment deck, tully deck ...) but mostly they get the short end because everyone joins up against them. 

A special case among the LCG's is that there is no hand limit. Drawing becomes very important. I like the meta in this game, with the rush, aggro, control and combo decks, and understanding it made the game blossom even more in my opinion.

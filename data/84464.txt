GAME: Animal Upon Animal: Balancing Bridge
RANK: 2431
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We like this more than the base version. That may be because it presents mini intermediate goals on the path to winning. Receiving an extra goal card instead of extra pieces when you topple the stack seems less punishing, even if the effect is similar.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Similar to Animal upon Animal but slightly better with objectives.  Maybe a touch more complicated for a 3-5 year old.

1st play: Forgot to log this earlier - it's decent, not as good for really little kids as basic animal upon animal, but better for slightly older kids, and more enjoyable for the adults playing with the kids, as this creates some challenging animal arrangements.

2nd play: I ultimately got rid of this, basic Animal upon Animal is better.  The rolling of the die creates needlessly frustrating moments when the animals you want aren't available.

04+, 2-4, best with 4, 15 minutes. Given to T for Christmas 2011. This is just great. Lots of fun. All can play. Short enough for a 3 year old but still requires some thinking and planning. Beautiful pieces, ingenious box.

I really like this version of Animal Upon Animal. They new animals are very nice and I really like the giraffe. The cards add a new element to the game and the way the game box doubles as your playing area is very neat too.

Juego muy divertido, estilo Jenga ya que hay que colocar piezas sobre otras y mantener el Balance, pero le da tres patadas. Las cartas de "misión" lo convierten en un juego estratégico que hace que los adultos puedan disfrutarlo mas.

Rated 8 after three plays in a night. This is supposedly a children's game. But honestly, there's enough silly fun in here for adults as well as long as they don't take things too seriously. Separating this from the original Animal Upon Animal is the starting cards with specific goals for stacking animals. It adds a nice bit of strategy. I'm not sure how much that changes things for kids, but for some adults that have had a drink or two, it works really well.

Animal Upon Animal with secret objectives! The animals are larger, which I dislike, but adding goals is a really great change to the game and keeps it interesting. Playing the game in the (huge) game box is neat, but I still enjoy the original more.

30-45m, 2-4 players. 5+ plays.

RATING: 7
I usually try to avoid expansions and spinoffs, but this is a good one for anyone who enjoys the original. Players once again are stacking wooden animals but this time the goal is to place specific animals adjacent to each other based on secret objective cards dealt at the start of the game. Great for both adults and kids.  4-11

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Even more animal types to add to the base game 

I really like the bridge mechanic here and the die face that makes you move an already placed animal can lead to some torturous decisions and catastrophic collapses of the pyramid :devil:

I really like the objective cards too as they add a little more strategy and you are looking for specific formations on animals rather than just getting rid of all before your opposition.

Better than the original game. In the original, I didn't like how you could roll alligator and keep widening the playing area. The bridge in this version limits the size. I also like the cards better than just trying to get rid of your animals. 

It works best with 4 people, but is fun regardless.

This game is very good. I prefer playing it at two players with open hands so there is more strategy. My 5 years old loves it (hence the huge amount of games) and is deceptively good at it too.

RATING: 8
My favorite Animal Upon Animal game due to the addition of the goal cards.  To me they just really work to add interest to the game.  I much prefer this one to the base Animal Upon Animal game and even as an adult I would play this version with other adults and not just children (And I cannot say that for almost any other Dexterity game besides perhaps something like Flick 'em Up).

I nice dexterity game where you put animals together to match your cards.  You complete all your cards and you win.  If you have animals fall you take another card.  I loved this game.  It is not a deep game but it was a lot of fun and would be great with kids.

RATING: 8
I'll admit that I may enjoy Animal Upon Animal more than my 5 year old!  This is an improvement over the original.  Makes it a bit more game-y since you need to complete various goals (certain animals must be touching) to win.  Box is huge - wasn't expecting that.

Very cute parts, a little too easy for the adults so we had to have alternative rules (must use left hand, take extra cards, etc). The game is more fun when you just try to stack the animals as high as they go. The game board is also very large. I'd recommend the original Tier auf Tier over this for portability's sake.

I like this better than the original Animal upon Animal for playing with smaller kids. It's less about not knocking the animals down (although that still happens) and more about where in the stack you put them to achieve your secret goal cards.

I really enjoyed this game from an adult standpoint.  this brings the stacking animal concept of the original game and ramps up a little strategy and tactics.  The addition of goals turns picking your animals and where they may be place into a real dilemma as you don't want to help your opponent.   You may even want to knock some of the animals off on purpose if you think it will hinder your opponent more than gaining an extra card.   Played with my four year old and she got the concept after a little while but it was a little advanced to play against other adults though.

secret missions that drive creating weird and tall structures make the game much better than most stack-until-it-falls games, and they make it more than just hoping the player to your right messes up.  There is actually some strategy, and it encourages risky plays!

I'll rate this as a kids game, though it could easily be played and enjoyed by many adults.

I've played lots of the original Animal Upon Animal many times over.  It plays so well with kids of all ages, and really excels with smaller children.  Balancing Bridge is a bit different, including the use of cards (which in my opinion is strange--small kids tend to mangle them).

I love this game--I will say that this version, when played with the right adults, can be downright mean.

I like this one, but we've have games where one player just happened to be dealt a hand that matched there other cards in one form or another and ended the game within five minutes.
We deal 4 or 5 cards when playing 2 players.  We find it takes some of the ease out of being dealt a 'lucky' hand.

The game seems a little easier than the original.  I think you could start the game with more cards if you want to up the difficulty.  The pieces are large and chunky.  Especially the giraffe.  The bat is larger than you would have guessed too.  That said I like the game and the pieces.  The cards are an interesting concept.  I need to make a card set that includes the animals from the base game and the duel.

Tier auf Tier: Das große Abenteuer is a very fun version of Tier auf Tier, but I don't rate it as highly as the base game, given the lack of variety.

The new animals are cool, and a great addition to your Tier auf Tier collection, but the Balancing Bridge game with the cards is very fun too.

Should you tire of just the five animals in the game, then simply put the cards aside, add all your other Tier auf Tier animals, and just use the bridge for the fun it adds to the game, but now with some 23+ animals to choose from.

This is a must-have for the family gamer, please give it a try.

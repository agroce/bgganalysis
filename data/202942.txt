An excellent introduction to OCS - much more varied set of scenarios than Reluctant Enemies (which only has one scenario with two finish points). Also has a very short (by OCS standards) campaign game.

My Allies just couldn't get it going and I was forced to concede an Axis victory around 3/4 of the way thru.

Giving OCS another chance....and it makes the saving throw! I finally grokked the system, cracked the code, what have you, and can see the machine parts moving and what it can produce. A great system but with so many layers it needs to be practiced repeatedly I think. Sicily II is a good game with only one map and a short campaign, perhaps a little fiddly with lots of air and landing rules, but a tense experience nevertheless.

They sell this as an introduction to OCS but is has naval assault and airborne assault. I think Reluctant enemies is way easier to learn than this for someone new to this series. 

I also must say that this game is not my favorite in the series.

Played Scenario 3, and two sessions of Scenario 5.  Then played 5 sessions of Scenario 5 and had to stop because I mis-read the range of my Bf-109's.

An outstanding game system. I really like how the game restrikts the armchair general via logistics as in the real world. Sicily II is very playable due to its relatively few units on board. Especially the introducory scenarios are very fast to pick up.

Although one of the smaller OCS games at 1 map and just a couple of days to play the full campaign, Sicily II includes just about every feature of the system from carriers and amphibious assaults to airdrops and logistics nightmares.  There's lots of room for variations on the Allied strategy, even with the historical campaign.  You can actually have Patton support Monty, although I suppose that risks Mt Etna blowing up.  The Axis has options too, particularly whether to deploy their limited bomber force against the carriers or to try to disorganize the Allied attack stacks.  Given the rugged terrain, these stacks need to be big, so they're tempting targets.  Overall, Sicily II is a quintessential OCS game, logistics-bound, where not every unit can afford to move every turn, much less fight.  It's a nice addition to the series.

One map version published as part of Operational Matters, an Operational Combat Series magazine.  Same scale as Beyond the Rhine (3.5 miles per hex rather than the standard OCS scale of 5 miles per hex).  The original Sicily was at 2.5 miles per hex.

In this version, Allied infantry divisions are represented as single multi-step counters, rather than as multi-unit divisions, which reduces the counter density to accommodate the smaller map.

It's OCS which once you understand the system is amazing. Thee magazine which comprises articles on how best to understand the system, is good. production value I think is high and the content is well written. 

The game is easy to get into if your new to the system. i broke my cherry on Reluctant Enemies and I'd say their is a similar learning curve between Siciliy 2 and Reluctant Enemies. The components are standard MMP/OCS and our nice and fit for purpose.

I would have given more stars but my gaming has been hampered by poor opponents. They are not exactly newbies to OCS but appear to suffer some kind of premature dementia and forget even the basic rules. So, I have been forced to hand-held them and therefore haven't fully been able to concentrate on my own play. And yes, we did have a walk-through of Primosole bridge AAR in OCS Guide (as we previously have had with Reluctant Enemies).

One Campaign game played. 
Don't forget to read the erratas or the Allies cannot send supplies and units from Tunisia.

A good game, maybe much more difficult for Axis.
Don't like how VP are calculated.

This game is a true game, not just an introduction to OCS.

RATING: 7
Playable upgrade, great addition to a great system.  Counter art and map are exceptional as always, a challenge to play well as the Axis, they have their work cut out.  Strategically, a strong counter-attack probably doesn't work, but it is fun so try it anyway.

The naval and amphibious rules are very fiddly. It's clear that the rules are stretching what is ostensibly a rules system for air land combat to accommodate, however poorly, the naval component. There are scenarios that start after the initial landings, which are pretty close to the optimal axes of advance anyway, so there's very little reason to play out the naval component.

This is basically a holding action, followed by a race by both sides to Messina. Near the end of the Allied Invasion of Sicily the Allies invaded mainland Italy at Salerno, whilst the Axis had very few troops in Italy, causing all the German units in Sicily to rush back to Italy across the Straits of Messina. The Germans receive VP depending on how many quality (i.e. AR 3+) units they can evacuate to Italy, as well as how long they can hold off the Allies. Evacuation is complicated by Allied interdiction scenario rules, which means that Axis units may never use strategic movement, so an evacuation is going to be a slow fighting withdrawal.

There are 16 turns the Germans have to survive to get the requisite 6 VP to claim a draw—assuming no other VP conditions apply. The Allies have overwhelming numerical and qualitative superiority, so many of the combats will involve the Germans taking optional results as retreats. The Italians are going to do virtually no fighting in this campaign. Whilst the Italian forces numbered over 300,000 men, they were almost exclusively low quality garrison forces used for guarding the coast and will surrender at the first opportunity.

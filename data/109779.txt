Gameplay is deeper (and nastier) than the graphics would lead you to believe. It is a good tile-laying game - essentially set collecting with a spatial element to it. Dice-placement is all the rage, with games like Castles of Burgundy, Troyes, and Kingsburg proving big hits. This is a nice light use of the mechanic. The theme doesn't really come through, but it all looks gorgeous. Suffers from significant down-time issues, since players cannot plan their turn ahead; dice rolling means you can only make decisions once your dice have been rolled. This could be countered by adding more dice and allowing all players to roll at once.

Quick, light, fun game about gardening... with dice. That's what the box says, that's what you get, and it's great. Setting up your own combos or sneaking your plants in your opponents' combos is very interesting. The dice gives the game the luck element it needs to be very exciting.

1st play: This game has a nice use of dice mechanics, and a cute theme. I enjoyed planting the different seeds and the threat of the attacks from other player's birds/rabbits. I could see this game moving up with more plays as we learn how to better utilize the different mechanics of the game. I could also see it going down due to lack of variability leading to a samey feeling.

No 2nd play: I had an opportunity to play this, and instead we played travel blog. I rate that game a 6 so this deserves its 5

RATING: 6
A family tile laying game where all players plant their seeds in the same garden using dice. I like the artwork. There is a lot of interaction because each player controls a bird/rabbit that can eat other players' seeds and veggies. 

Despite all that, the game still feels a bit dry.

RATING: 8
Dice strategy game in the same vein as Alien Frontiers. There is a cool combo-y tile laying system which might appeal to fans of puzzle/match 3 games. 

I liked this a lot with 2 players. People with AP can slow it down a lot as you're selecting actions from combos of dice, and considering optimal placements to leech off of the actions of others. The fact that 4 sets of dice aren't included upsets me, and makes me dock a half point or so... only sort of joking.

RATING: 6
This game has a lot more going on than I suspected when I first opened the cute, Josh Cappel-adorned box. 

The game is like a dice abstract. It's all about set collection of different vegetables which both score points at the time of harvest as well as during the end of the game. The four dice rolled each turn let you do all sorts of stuff--buying seeds, planting seeds, watering seeds, harvesting vegetables, placing sundials/scarecrows/gnomes (!), or placing and moving critters that can nibble your opponents plants.

There is a lot of tension from quickly planting/watering/harvesting single plants, but the real drive of the game comes from setting up chain reactions (especially off of your opponents actions). The interaction is very tight because you're always trying to leech off of your efforts of your neighbor, sometimes to the point where they choose not to score to keep you from scoring. It's a blast. 

Simple, clever--a great puzzle for 2-4 players.

Some games are perfect for families and some are perfect for gamers.  Every once in a while you end up with one that works for both.  Garden Dice does this.  It can scale up in complexity and in strategy.  But even as a base game - it's very approachable for families.  Its theme works well with all ages.  As a gamers' game, there are some strategic elements that really ratchet up the planning and conflict points.  Production quality is very good with all components made well.  Graphics are clear and clean.  A very nice game that should be on the shelf of any green thumb gamer.

Upon discovering modern designer boardgames, Garden Dice was probably my third love after Carcassonne and Dixit. My rating of 9 is for when it's played as a 2-player game with the card expansion and a few minor house rule fixes. What initially attracted me was the fact that I'm a gardener myself who has experience growing all the veggies that feature in the game: tomatoes, eggplant, squash, carrots and artichoke. The only thing more satisfying than growing them yourself is playing a boardgame about growing them! Beyond the joys of the theme, I really enjoy the dice allocation mechanic. The chaining mechanism when watering is great as well. My collection of gardening and farming theme games has grown exponentially over the past couple of years, and I doubt I'll ever relinquish any of them, especially not Garden Dice. This is one I want to be playing in the year 2050 with my grandkids.

Normally I love dice games, so you'd think I would be 100% on board with a game like this, but I just found it startlingly bland. There was nothing imaginative or original in Garden Dice, and it felt like a pile of abstracted mechanisms with an extremely loose connection to the theme. Sure birds eat seeds and bunnies eat vegetables, but where's the logic in animals running in straight lines and 6s turning birds into bunnies? It's just a mish-mash of ways to use the results of a die roll in order to restrict what you can do on your turn. I want to get on board with this game because it isn't a flawed design (all the mechanisms function with one another) but I just found it so flavorless. It didn't create moments of excitement or anticipation. Even when a particular die roll was exactly what I needed I didn't shout out in joy, I just thought "OK looks like I can do this, this, and this on my turn." There was just no soul to the game, and it dragged on much too long. I wasn't happy after playing, but I also wasn't particularly upset, I was simply ready to move on to another game because this one was just so lackluster.

Game play is weak. Dice rolls weaken all possible strategy with very little mitigation. Hope for the best and react without thought. It's difficult to set up a garden chain when the dice tell you exactly where to plant. BUT, with all of my complaints it still has enough to be mildly entertaining. 

I sighed though when I had to put these small stickers on the small discs. Not my idea of fun to add this little feature for unappealing aesthetic purposes.

Tile laying and dice allocation? Sign me up! I really like the watering mechanic: it creates a kind of game of "chicken" as players hold off on watering their seeds until they absolutely have to. I get the impression that that the sundial is always better than the scarecrow, and the bird is always better than the rabbit, but only more plays will tell. I also don't think it's the best two-player game, but it works well enough to play occasionally.

Fun.  Played with the kids a handful of times.  We like it but it seems to be a little long for what it is so we don't play it often.  If we are going to commit to an hour or so, we tend to go for heavier games like Trajan, Concordia, or La Granja because we feel like we get more "game" out of the same amount of play time than we do with Garden Dice.

Excellent component quality. Nice theme which meshes well with the gameplay. I liked this game, but my gaming partner did not. Neither one of us are very much into dice games.

The game didn't really grab me.  Not too much strategy to it.  Strings some seed/veggies together and hope they don't get eaten by other players' birds/rabbits.   There's a bit of tactical strategy in placing tiles but it is negated by so much dice rolling.   I could be convinced to play it again, but doubt it will make it back to the table.

I’d like to say this one is a good evening ender, but it’s probably best as a family dice game that has nice artwork and reasonably interesting game play. While there are some interesting choices in how to use your bonus tiles and your dice, you still need to roll well so you can place your seeds in the 2x bonus spaces. 

More and more games these days are finding ways to use dice creatively and equate low and high rolls so it’s surprising that this doesn’t do that in any way. I wish they had put 2x bonus spaces near the 1 and 2 coordinates instead of just near the 5 and 6 ones so as to mitigate dice rolls. Instead, the best strategy seems to be to place your sundial and use it to modify rolls to 5s and 6s and place any tiles there you can. Not much more to it than that.

Really nice dice rolling game where you spend different dice for different effects. The limit of 8 markers means that players cannot hoard seeds and thus must plant them and water them and harvest them. Whilst this sounds obvious it can quickly mean you spend out on tokens and thus your action options are quite reduced. 

It is simple enough I believe I will be able to play with my daughter.

I think the game is lacking somewhat with only two players as the bird/rabbit tile is very ineffective with two players however I can see it being really useful when there are more players and thus more on the board.

The same applies to the scarecrow which, giving 3 points extra per vegetable harvested, was incredibly powerful with just two players however this effect will be more diluted with the full compliment of players as there will be more competition for space in the garden.

Really nice simple artwork and good thickness to the tiles, the added gnome mini-expansion is a nice touch its just a shame that the dice are so cheap and lightweight.

Having now played the gnome expansion it is a little confusing as you can only add pips to your dice for buying seeds, watering or harvesting and yet players keep wanting to add pips to dice for planting. I actually reminded one player 3-4 times in a single game of this and yet it still was not sinking in.

[b]Easy-to-teach game that uses die-rolls to power actions. Good 4p family game that can be co-operative or cut-throat depending on players. This is almost worth keeping to me, but I don't play 4p often enough to keep it.

We didn't enjoy our [b]first play[/b] as a 2p game. Even with the stones, it felt too wide-open, and chaining wasn't interesting in a nil-sum situation. In our [b]second play[/b] with 4p, it was quite a bit better, as chains that helped other people scores bonus points, and all the non-plant tiles helped shape the game more. Fun.

This is a light-hearted game with a strategy backbone; I played it 1st time with the family, basically using family variant (the only use of critters was was to allow everyone to get their last turns in because we weren't all quite up to planning the end game on a 1st play).

I liked it a lot- the play was quick and efficient, there is a certain amount of strategy in setting up your locations for scoring, the tradeoffs between entering special tiles and concentrating on plants/points are definitely there, and there is certainly room for more head-to-head play with the critters which I haven't yet explored fully.

I'm starting this at a 7, but I hope it will come out again soon. Our first play was very memorable, though, as we played by candlelight in the dark of Hurricane/TS Sandy's passage here.

First play, we did not use the critters until near the end of the game (but mostly to burn dice, not really to actually eat other players' stuff). Actually knowing how things work and applying it proved to be different in practice. Hard to keep certain details straight. For most actions, you can use the exact number you rolled, or lower. EXCEPT when placing a tile on the board (must be exact coordinates) UNLESS you use the Sun Dial to adjust your numbers.

Scoring and play is fiddly; a lot of tiles to flip over/remove and each tile must have a player disc on top. Still I would like to try to play again.

This is a nice kid friendly game that offers enough strategy to keep it interesting for adults. You collect seeds, plant them on the board, water them and harvest them. You are trying to get sets of all different or three or more of the same. Begin near someone on the board since there watering or harvesting can move from high to low numbered cards and can help you. There is also the option to use birds or rabbits to attack your neighbors garden. We didn't do a lot of attacking. It is a fun light game.

Just an annoying design. I have to give the game credit for its theme and artwork, both of which I really like. But the whole bird/rabbit thing is just dumb and requires full buy in to be worthwhile. And the game just needs to be a lot lighter and quicker than it is. At first, games like Ypsahan used dice in a new, interesting, less random way. Here it just aggravates and doesn't add to the experience at all.

Fun cartoonish art, gardening theme, and a puzzle that really develops before your eyes.  There's alot to like about this one and it can be about as cutthroat as Survive: Escape from Atlantis.  The chaining aspect truly pushes you to take the risk of forming unlikely alliances for mutual benefit with possible peril for one of the parties. The danger of being left with too many unplanted seeds also breeds a sense of urgency.

I like it. It's got the harvesting part of [thing=40628][/thing] and the dice-placement part of [thing=84876][/thing]. Tough decisions all around but not much A.P. to speak of. And the fact that the active player can cause anybody's plants to become watered/harvested means that players are at least marginally engaged even when it's not their turns.

Beautifully produced, a family friendly tone (though some younger children may object to getting their seeds or vegetables eaten) and an excellent player aid mean the game is easy to grasp and play in most groups. The chain system used to activate cards is also a clever touch and deserves recognition. However, from my first impression is that the game is so weighted towards the person rolling the highest dice - only the sundial and sun offer opportunities to modify the roll - that this game will only bloom for a very short time in a gaming collection.

The sundial special card which gives the ability to 'modify the result rolled on one or two dice specifically for the purposes of determining coordinates,' is an interesting card and goes a distance to reduce the luck.  However, if everyone plays it early in the game - and I cannot see an argument why you wouldn't, though I am open to other suggestions - its impact is reduced.

Furthermore, if memory serves me correctly if you roll or able to manipulate a combination of dice equal or higher than a four and a six you have the opportunity to place a seed tile in a space which gives you a doubling bonus if you suceed in harvesting the vegetables on those squares. This equates to six spaces on the board.  This again disproportionately rewards the 'highest roller'.  I am sure this would of been tested so I am sure it must of been found to have a negative impact on the game but could a doubling squre been put at each square where you role a double - a total of six squares e.g. 1 & 1, 2&2 etc?  Would this of balanced out the luck and spread the contest out across the board?  I assume not as this would of been tested.

Ultimately, I feel that this game is nicely produced with some solid ideas but does not place much demands on the player like so many Kickstarter led games.

Love the chucking the dice and doing various things depending on what you got. Rarely do the dice screw you so bad that you cannot do *anything*. As in, it has never happened to anyone I've ever played with, but could happen, in theory. It is a nice game with easy to teach rules that beginners can pick up quickly and challenges the veterans by making them plan around what the dice give you. It makes for an interesting game even after the 10th play.

RATING: 7
My second kickstarter game, it arrived right before the end of the month and we have given it a couple of spins. Basically a game of rolling four dice and making best use of what you get, each dice can help you buy, plant, water and harvest your veggies, with an interesting chaining mechanism for the harvesting and watering such that planting lower value plants next to higher value ones means they grow more efficiently. The extra wrinkle of the special tiles which either modify the dice, protect your seedlings or prey upon your opponents' crops, you end up with a nice medium weight 45 minute game with a bit of thinking but not too much, a bit of competition but not too much. You can sometimes be left high and dry due to a dice roll when you really needed a 5 or a 6, but there is almost always something you can do to improve your position. So that is 2 out of 2 kickstarter games I have been well pleased with.

Very nice components, this Kickstarter project will please many with a nice theme and art. The game is dice-based and uses a dice-face mechanic to pick actions, like Troyes and Roma.

It's not a bad game, but it's certainly not a good one either. After our first game, I asked my wife: "what did you like about the game?" She said the art and the theme. I agree. It's cute, and congrats to Josh Cappel for his excellent work. As a game though, this one left us sort of empty.

Kind of a cutesy take on farming, similar to Farmaggedon (little less chaotic). The dice help you form grids where to plant, spend toward actions, and give you a currency for each turn. It was kind of unsatisfying for me, though, not entirely sure why.

Cute and well-produced, this game never seemed to appeal to either myself or my daughter.  It just seemed too wide open with too few options to choose from each turn.  I guess we gave it short shrift, seeing as how we only ever played it as a two-player and the size of the board seems to cry for at least three at the table, but they should have done a better job adapting the gameplay for lesser numbers if they were going to sell it as a two-player game.  Lots of other games to explore in the collection, hence its banishment.

It's a nice dice management game with innocent (spouse-friendly) theme, very tense, yet with simple mechanics and really good, solid components. 
Could be a brain burner for AP-prone players (the whole chain mechanic opens a whole world). Critters make it a competitive battle: you can play this game anyhow you please.
Very good.

心得:
策略層面不夠
有點太隨機了
主要收集多個同數字最賺
前期拿幾個大數字的
中期開始衝小數字就很有機會
5個不同數字的收集一組就夠了

規則:
*每種種子分類疊好2/3/4人使用5/7/10個每種，隨機起始
*每個人拿一種顏色標記(一個計分)，1鳥1日晷1太陽(2人時1石頭)標記
*每個人輪流行動，值四顆骰並選擇下面行動把骰子用完(四顆一樣可重骰)
1.花一顆骰買數值小於等於骰值的種子並放一個標記(沒標記不能買)，一回合不能買同數值的種子
2.花兩個骰子放版塊或種子到圖板上(骰點等於座標)放特殊標記(鳥日晷向上)上面要放個人標記(石頭不用)
3.用一顆骰翻面數值小於等於骰值的種子，周遭數字小於種子值的一起翻
4.用一顆骰收成數值小於等於骰值的種子並拿分數，周遭數字小於種子值的一起拿起記分，收成玩家每幫別人收成1個得1分
>在稻草人旁加3分，兩分區，分數*2但是在稻草人旁就不*2
5.用6骰點翻面特殊版塊
6.用骰子移動鳥/兔直線骰點格(可小於)，如果鳥/兔停在種子/果實上則結算(稻草人可保護九格內種子)，如果沒有自己的標記時不能使用，一回合可吃多個，但必須不同玩家的
>吃掉是結果2選1，1.移除該板塊並拿一個標記放在動物身上，2.該版塊轉回種子面放在自己面前上面放標記
7.移除動物標記，花兩個骰子定位，一個6骰點移除
*遊戲在最後一個種子被拿走，該玩家結束後結束記分，平手比所有收成果實總值
*每個沒種種子-5分(第一個不算)，一組5個不同15分，相同的3/4/5個10/15/20分，這兩種可重複記分，沒使用太陽板塊5分
*家庭遊戲不使用鳥/兔版塊
*日晷放在版圖後每回合可使用一次來 1.改變一顆骰1~2點 2.改變兩顆骰1點
*太陽標記可1.重骰四顆骰 2. 改變一顆骰到想要骰點
*矮人擴充
可用放置方式放置到圖版上，在圖版上後每輪可以改變增減兩點到骰子(一顆或兩顆)來做買種子灌溉跟收成三種行動，如果要增減第三點就翻面之後不能用，要一顆六骰才能翻回來，不能跟稻草人(日晷)並存在圖版上

I was hoping that this game would be something like Castles of Burgundy with player interaction but it doesn't fit that bill. High rolls are rewarded more than low ones (they give you more points and more options) and there are not a lot of interesting decisions to make. With aggressive players it can be hard to make effective chains that are the heart of this game.

This one is kind of hard to comment on because it does everything right, but ultimately I'd rather have such an abstract game less reliant on luck.  There quite a few number of choices that you have on your turn, but the reality is, whatever you set yourself up to do, getting the right rolls will always be better.

I found that my other issue with the game is that the potential for play diminishes as the game progresses, so once people are locked into their position, you have fewer and fewer options available to you to catch up.

I can see how the game could devolve into animal carnage as people just become deconstructionists for lack of anything worthwhile to do.

Could have been an interesting game with some interesting mechanics. 

Watering your own plants will water all adjacent plants of lower value. Which means placement within the garden should be strategic, but it's all based on a roll of the dice. The only decision you make is whether which of the 2 coordinates rolled to place your plant.

Higher rolls are also objectively better because they score bonuses.

RATING: 9
One of the best games of 2013, I think. It doesn't seem like much, you've only got a couple actions to plant, water and harvest, but the way they chain together just makes for a really elegant and compelling package. I love how you water or harvest something and it affects everything with a lower value in a chain. The set collection aspect adds a nice touch to make the choices of what you plant more interesting.

RATING: 6
There's lots to like, especially the way actions chain off of each other. I'm not sure how useful it is to attack others, but I think I like that you can. In the end, this is a dice game, so the player who rolls best will probably win. Garden Dice is still fun overall, but best played quickly without too much analysis.

At first I thought this game was awful, like a garden ruined by pests.  I started seeing more strategies as the game went on, so it did grow on me, like a cucumber in a garden.  Alas, it does seem too dry, despite all the dice, which I normally enjoy more.  Wouldn't mind trying again though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Interesting game.  I'm not sure what to think.  I enjoyed it, but it really feels like it rewards rolling well above anything else.  I do like the actions and the scoring mechanisms, but I feel like it's hard to do well without the rolls you want.  That may just have been because we were new to the game, and there wasn't a lot of good strategy going around.  Still, I won despite having strategized for the wrong rules for the first half of the game simply because I rolled what I wanted the most times.

I also think the game bogs down some due to not having much idea what your actions will be on your turn.  I would consider implementing screens and more dice just to let people see what they will be able to do when their turn comes around.

Overall, it's a decent game, I think, if a little too long for what it is.  It has very nice looking components, and I'd play it again.

Roll dice. Use the dice to buy stuff, flip it and score it. Higher numbers allow you to do this with higher value seeds. Placing it in the higher co-ordinates doubles the score.

No tactical depth at all. Roll high and win.

I enjoy this solid tile laying game, with dice rolled and used as actions. It's a little on the thinky side, and runs a little long for 3 or 4 players. It does scale just fine for 2, and I prefer it that way.

There is some dice mitigation, but it is still a bit random. I'd rather play Castles of Burgundy, but this plays faster.

There's a lot you can do in this game. I'd like to play with 4 players and a fuller board. Its fine with 2, but the spaciousness of the board can mean a shift to offense/defense and a bit away from forced cooperation and maximized points.

A great mix of luck and strategy means that it's fun for gamers and non-gamers alike.

It's also quite possible to include and exclude various parts of the game (sundial,rabbit/bird,gnome) etc. to make it simpler for younger folk or those new to gaming.

Garden Dice is a dice allocation game which features upper echelon components.

The game plays best with 3 or 4 players and the game weight is variable,  depending on which tiles you choose to play with.  I prefer to not include the bird/rabbit and gnome tiles.  The card expansion is a great addition - one I consider a must -  and can level the playing field for those who find the dice acting in a less than kind fashion.

About [thing=109779][/thing] and [thing=134115][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=109779][/thing] is a game about buying seeds, planting them, watering them to become vegetables, harvesting them, scoring some points, get some sets and collections and, possible, using sundials, scarecrows or gnomes do help you out, or birds or rabbits to mess with the others - but this is costly and hardly the game will devolve into the curse of the were rabbit. This isn't a Thunderdome of vegetables, where two seeds enter and one vegetable goes out, leaving a patch of churned dirt and a seed, that was full of hope, now lifeless, behind.

In [thing=109779][/thing] players will roll dice and use them to do the actions, the best way possible. The goal is to harvest veggies, which score, and again score in the end, by sets (having all types) and by collections (having lots of one type). Is all about points.

The main twist to the basic tile placement and set collection, is the chaining. When watering or harvesting, these actions will chain with nearby seeds and veggies, respectively, which can be used by players, not only to make one action worth more (by doing it several times), but also to try to use the actions of others to get the things you want. Therefore, positioning is key.

[thing=109779][/thing] is easy to teach and to play (even for kids under 13, which is the recommended age for the game - we have one much younger, and he played well enough, needing little help and grasping all the basic actions, even if the overall strategy escaped him a little). The art and graphics are very well done and is pretty to see it on the table - it has a nice and pleasant "family" look. The player aid is of a kickass class, really great - is what a player aid should aim to be.

The game runs for a little too long. Nothing major, however - it would be nice if it ended in around 45-50 minutes, but it usually ends somewhat over one hour. And we found that the [thing=134115][/thing] is, to us, key to make the gameplay shines more.

Still, [thing=109779][/thing] works well, has layers and possibilities and it provides the positive interaction - you usually affect the others in a good way, by helping them with watering and harvesting actions, more than with harmful actions, which serves well for a family-oriented game (although, [thing=109779][/thing] can also fit in gamers group also).

While the dice can turn some people off [thing=109779][/thing], the game provides ways to deal, up to a point, with bad die rolls. The sundial and gnome (and expansion, which comes with the base game) allow to manipulate the numbers on the dice, and the positioning of the scarecrow can make places on the board better for you, even when considering low numbers rolled. Yet, there is luck in the game and rolling high tends to be considerable better most of the time.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
In her turn the player rolls 4 dice. The numbers on the dice are used to:
a) Buy a seed. The seed must be of value equal or lower then that of the die;
b) Place a tile. It uses two dice, and determin the place on the garden (which is a 6x6 grid) that the seed/bird/sundial/gnome will be planted;
c) Water a seed. The seed watered must be of value equal or lower then that of the die used. This triggers the chaining, affecting other adjancent (not diagonally) seeds of lower value;
d) Harvest a veggie. Once watered the seed becomes a veggie, which can be harvested. The veggie must be of value equal or lower then that of the die used. This triggers the chaining, affecting other adjancent (not diagonally) veggies of lower value. The player scores points equal to the veggies harvested - and 1 bonus point for each harvested veggies of other players, due to the chaining;
e) Flip a special tile. Birds can be changed into Rabbits and Sundials can be turned into Scarecrows by spending a die with a 6;
f) Move a critter. Critters (birds and rabbits) move in straight lines, moving a number of spaces equal or lower of the used die. More than one die can be used to move a critter in the same turn. Critters can eat other players seeds or veggies;
g) Remove a critter. It requires spending two dice equal to the coordinate of the critter and a third die with a 6 on it.

With the [thing=134115][/thing] anoher option is added:
h) Play 1 card or discard 1 card on your turn. When your turn ends, draw a replacement card if one was used or discarded.

And special action is spend the Sun token to either re-roll all the 4 dice or chance the number of a die to any other.

That is it. All the actions during the game will be one of these. Everything will be done to harvest veggies, score points for them and even more at the end of the game, due to the sets (one of each type of veggie) and colletions (several of one type). The game ends when the last seed tile is taken - the current player ends her turn, then there is the final scoring. The player with the most points, wins!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which action to do with the dice available. This will be in all your turns. While [thing=109779][/thing] poses as a strategy game, it really is more a tatical one, since you can't really count with the numbers on the die, nor know which you will roll. Still, with some room to manipulation of the numbers and use for high and low dice, most of the time players will make the decisions they want, or, at least, one a little worst, but, still, not really bad.

There is a strong timming component to the game, which must be taken into consideration while making decisions, mostly due to the chaining mechanic of the watering and the harvesting - is normally best to use the actions of others and/or make yours make several of these actions at once.

Also, there is the positioning aspect: the placement of tiles (seeds and special tiles) is key to do well, for many reasons: protection from the critters, to enhance the chaining possibilities, to improve score (either by putting a see in a star space, or by placing it near a scarecrow) or to use critters to greater effect. Therefore, the placement is, usually, the decision that takes more time from players.

Overall, the decisions aren't hard to be made, as the dice serve to restrain the possibilities and make easier for the player, as the realm of possibilities gets shorter.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Very good art and graphics, making the game both pleasing to the eyes and easy to be played;
- Great player aid, which makes playing even easier;
- The components are top notch - except the dice: though they are made of wood, which I tend to like, mine came scratched, but the balance of them seems fine;
- Easy to teach and to play, even for kids;
- Can have a good amount of interaction, but most of it is positive - players help, even if unwillingly, the others. There is harmful interaction also, but is costlier;
- Multiple ways to score makes all the veggies important.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- It would be best if the [thing=134115][/thing] come with the base game, even if as a variant, and not be an expasion, as the game, for us, is much better with it and it adds almost nothing in rules;
- Luck of the roll plays a good part in the game;
- No evolution during play makes the game feel somewhat repetitive (I will extend this bellow) and this also makes the playing time gets too near of boredom. The cards also help a little in this.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like having a garden. Only those that do can relate - having a garden is a joy... when everything goes right, which is about 10% to 20% of the time, all the rest is preocupation. When I had one, on my backyard, most of the time I was either worrying with weather and critters or hoping that a sprout would appear and become a gorgeous veggie.

When I mentioned that [thing=109779][/thing] isn't a game of severe and constant attacks, I didn't say it isn't a game of worrying. Once someone put a critter on the board, everyone became concern. Though harvesting haven't stopped, people were trying to do plant a seed and water in the same turn, otherwise the Bird, looming, could chirp doom to the hopeful seed. This made for smaller chains and less interaction between players, however, this was mostly due to threat than anything else, as the Bird only ate 2 seeds during the whole game.

[thing=109779][/thing] works well regarding its rules - few exceptions, quick to grasp. However, the playing time isn't what it should be. Around 1 hour isn't bad, but considering the game has little development, it would be better for it to be a 35 to 45 minutes game. During the game you will be doing the same thing in the last turn as you did in your first. You won't have a "machine" working that you use the game to built and now will unleash in the final rounds. No player will have a better deal to buy or sell, a better route, a better storage, a better veggie, a better land to plant, a better irrigation, a better defense against critter or weather, a better anything, except for the bonus the sundial/scarecrow give. This is too little to be worth the repetition.

It would be neat if [thing=109779][/thing] allowed for more differentiation, but it would be a different game, a more complex one, and not necessarily a better one, nor fit for the same public [thing=109779][/thing] is reaching for. The cards expansion do give a little more differentiation, not a lasting one (except when giving points), but at least enough for players to seek different (short) paths to fulfill or get the most of a card.

As a game of similar actions throughout the whole play, [thing=109779][/thing] could use a shorter playing time. It seems easy to do this, by simple removing some tiles - I haven't done this yet, so I can't say it would work the same, but it seems it would just fine. Therefore, my recommendation is doing this - and playing with the [thing=134115][/thing], as this adds loads of flavor to the game with very little contamination (the luck of the draw) - of course, for those wanting a more strategic approach to the game, this expansion isn't recommended, as even though the cards are usually balanced between them, there are indeed those that are better and those that are worse, and there is no way of knowing what the others are holding.

In the end, [thing=109779][/thing] is a good fit for a family game with slightly more complexity, while still providing enough to hold the interest of more seasoned gardners - but the interest, as a good weather, can quickly fade. so it is better to make it quick.

Really feels like Alien Frontiers-lite, which is funny considering the disparate themes.  Great looking and feeling game that you can teach to anyone. 

I think the simple mechanisms feel exciting at first but there aren't enough ways to enjoyably manipulate the dice.  So games typically start off with lots of options and ways to spend your dice and as the game moves on, the options dwindle and you're left being a slave to the dice rolls.  This is the opposite of what you usually want in a dice manipulation game to keep it exciting, increased options as the game goes on.

4 player games can get crowded, and with 6 being so valuable for everything, sometimes you'll get stuck in a rut where everyone is just going around hoping to roll 6's.

RATING: 7
Garden Dice is a fairly abstract dice game where you roll dice, then use those dice to acquire seeds, place them on a grid, water them (causing them to flip into veggies), then harvest the veggies for points. Points are awarded at game end for complete sets of a variety of veggies, but also for multiples of the same veggie, so strategy can vary.

The game can be a bit confrontational, as you can set your bird out on the board to gobble up opposing player's seeds, or your rabbit to eat their veggies. The game also gives you a Sundial/Scarecrow token, which you can use to modify your dice rolls, or protect your seeds. I find I hate to give up my sundial's ability to modify dice, so I never get my scarecrow into play. But I'm sure you can win that way, it's just a groupthink thing for me.

I think the most interesting element of the game is the chaining. When you water a seed, everything that's adjoining with a lower number also flips. So, if you set things up correctly and flip a 5, then your adjacent 4 flips, then your 3, then your 2, and so on. The same thing happens when you harvest veggies. So a smart player can flip and collect a bunch of veggies in one move. But, wait too long to set things up, and a another player can eat you, ruining your potential chains. So there's a bit of press your luck involved.

Doug the designer was kind enough to ask me to playtest the prototype, then sent me the final published version as a thank you. The finished product is amazing, it has top notch production values. Thick tiles, great Josh Cappel artwork, a first class product all the way around. If I had purchased the game, I'd have been very pleased with the value. And it has a good game inside the box as well.

A dice placement/utilization game that knows how to not outstay its welcome. Meaningful decisions each turn, without extended downtime. Significant player interaction and various strategies all in a remarkable presentation. Like Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride, you can play this as a friendly family game or as a more cutthroat gamer's game.

One last note, the components, graphic design, etc. for this title are amazing (you wouldn't guess it was the first title from a new publisher).

Extremely clever design that uses dice to determine coordinates on the board. Has a chaining mechanic ala puzzle video games that is incredibly satisfying.

What a cute and fun game. Easy to play and using the special tiles can be such an advantage. I love dice games so this is right up my ally. Using the sundial helps you make the dice another number so you can put your seeds in a better area. Great art work on the tiles and board. Fun family game. I need to get the expansion now.

Overall, this game is a bit on the light side for my taste. It does have just enough room for meaningful decisions to save it from dismissal as just another luck-filled dice game, and the theme boosts it above complete mediocrity for me, since I love gardening. I prefer to play without the bird/rabbit tiles.

RATING: N/A
Exactly as the name advertises. Action point allowance to take gardening actions where dice values determine what seed you can buy, planting, watering and harvesting. Dice coordinates determine where you can plant in the community garden. One part of the garden grows better and thus earns more points. Interactive component deploying a bird or rabbit to pester your neighbor gardeners who don't wisely deploy their scarecrow. You can even place a sun dial or garden gnome to manipulate dice values.  Fun, light game. A little chaotic with four people in a tight garden especially with all the birds and rabbits. I like it better with two or three players. Decent strategy to go for big "cascading" water and harvest moves. I prefer to play with the garden dice card expansion for fun value but makes the game swingy (but that is OK for us). Growing eggplant is an added bonus.

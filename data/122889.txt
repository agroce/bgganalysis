The obvious comparison is with El Grande; area control, a similar number of areas to control, and both games are card driven, El Grande by its priority and action cards, Dominare by its characters.  Dominare has a much greater variety of characters than El Grande has actions, which may seem like a good thing.  Players add a character to their tableau each turn, ending the game with seven.  Quite a nice touch is that each character has a couple of numbered actions.  An action can be used if the character's position in the tableau is greater or equal to the action's number.  Higher numbered actions are more powerful, but can only be used late in the game.

That greater variety of actions does bring some problems.  It's turn seven, my final chance of domination.  Do I spend several minutes studying everybody's characters, trying to figure out all the permutations, all the possible responses to my actions?  No, this game is quite long enough without that; I do what I can and hope for the best.

The low powered actions in the early game and the lack of any in-game scoring render the early turns oddly flat.  The high powered actions and three rounds to use them in make the final turn quite chaotic.  So not a great game, nor even a particularly good one, despite some attractive features.

Production quality is pretty good, although the absence of a turn marker is curious.  The artwork is fairly ordinary.

At first sight a normal Euro; but the degree of randomness (and ability to inflict "take that" from some powerful abilities) are well outside the normal Euro range.
Skill does still definitely help but is not necessarily sufficient.
Lords of Waterdeep and Ankh Morpork both seem to handle the "city with conspiracies" meme better.

Usually I dont like area control games but this one seems good. Players are trying to control the various city districts that award VP at the end of the game. I like the drafting mechanic and the clever use of the agent cards. Comes with a double-sided huge board. i need more plays to judge the game better.

RATING: 5.5
It started as a very interesting game but it overstayed its welcome. I usually love area control games and Dominare is not bad, but there is one thing missing, the massive limitation of moving influence around the board makes it a rigid design. There is a certain fun factor and I must admit that I would probably play again, but for sure not more than a few times. I like long games which provide increasingly more options, but this was not the case.

RATING: 6.5
This is a very good concept for a game, but it turns out to become chaotic with 4+ players. Too many abilities to be aware of and an area control element that makes it impossible to plan a strategy.

On the other hand, I liked the abilities and the feeling of development

RATING: 8
I enjoyed this as a 2 player game, but with 4 players the tactics change as it is vicious. The way the agents link together and can control various districts is good, you have to choose which districts to go for as it is impossible to get them all. I have seen few games that ebb and flow as much as this one in terms of who is winning. A well produced game, although you can easily be shafted by card draws in the second half of the game as some of the powers are good (eg being able to play 2 influence while someone else can play 8 from a single agent action).

Not rating this one since after we read the rules we realized this is just an overblown version of Courtier. Not surprisingly as it is in the Tempest series of games. As with all the Tempest games the art is phenomenal and the components are top notch. But we are finding with Courtier and this that area control is a mechanism we are not terribly keen on.

Yes - the mechanics work very good. I still need a few things to call this game perfect though:
a) per round scoring
b) more playtested card abilities, less chaotic towards the end
c) perhaps a better use of money

First play: demonstrated at Essen 2012. The game build slowly but becomes more frantic as the games progresses. The game is well structured but pivots on the variable powers of the character cards. And here the chaos begins. The ability to wipe out blocks if districts and swing ownership makes planning very difficult.  Too chaotic. Not a game to buy unlikely to play again.

The rules are a mess.

The cards are unbalanced like hell. Draw good ones to select from at start and you'll be far ahead.

The draft is a joke because it makes recruiting just another pass action (like take 1 crown). Oh, I did six times take 1 crown or recruit since I had no other actions which made any sense.

The game builds to slowly and then suddenly gets frantic without any control on what's happening.

All in all: a really bad gaming experience.

RATING: 7.5
Much more strategic than I thought it was going to be. Your most important decisions arguably come before you've even played a single turn. Because the early selection of the role cards is so important, I'd like to see the drafting process from Seasons 3-4 implemented at the beginning of the game, because having a crappy starting hand can really determine the outcome of the game very early on.

I am not a big fan of "tug-of-war" area control games (think 1960 or Courtier), especially in a two-player game, and this suffered a bit from that. The big difference from Courtier, however, was that the role cards often had game-changing effects which made some regions no longer contestable. This can have a major impact on your long-term strategy, as you have to adapt your plans based on other players' special powers. The distinctive combination of tactics and strategy make this a very engaging, and fun game.

Lots of good stuff in here, but the final mixture isn't quite right for me, at least on first blush - a game that promises more than it delivers, sadly.

RATING: 8
While the board play is pretty standard area majority fare, the added dimension of the card play which varies your abilities to do different things, differentiating yourself from the other players, is a brilliant addition.

Every round, players get to play a new character to their pool of characters.  Characters generally have a few abilities on the card each.  The earlier in the game you play them, the weaker they are, whereas they often have a strong ability if played later in the game.  The process of deciding which characters to play when is often difficult, as you'll need to balance which actions you need now vs. which you think you'll want later in the game!  There are also way more characters than you'll ever use in a game, so game to game variety is going to be great!

The board play is very El Grande-esque to me.  A lot of pieces get played, and the board can be very fluid, with the board situation often changing rapidly depending on the character abilities.  So, there is some chaos there in that nothing is for granted, but again, your choice of characters can always help to stabilize things for you, or at least mess with other players in turn.

The character cards also mean you can really focus on a strategy for the game, especially if you play with a draft at the beginning of the game.  If you want to pursue a certain strategy, you can draft characters that will specifically help that strategy, which means you can approach each game with a fresh angle if you'd like.

Dominare also has a distinction of being a very thematic cube-pusher.  While the game is very squarely eurogame in design, you can really remember the story arc of the characters used in the game.  For example, one game I played in featured an innocent boy and his dog being continually lambasted by the town newspaper as a mischievous pair not to be trusted.  There were solid game reasons that the player with the paperboy character kept doing this to the player with the boy and his dog, but it generated a lot of laughter and I can still remember it a year later.  I can't say that about any game of El Grande I've ever played.

Overall, just a great area majority game with a high level of player interaction as well as a high level of replayability, and fun thematic elements that go beyond any other game in this genre.

Oh Dominare, how do I love thee???? Let me count the ways. I loved this game so much that I bought Courtier and will most likely buy Mercante, and will DEFINITELY buy Love Letters. I got killed game after game at this, and came back for more because it is so brilliant! You pick out your Conspiracy and watch it get defeated turn after turn, as other people play their conspiracy that has a similar path but in such a different way. We have yet to have a game come in at under 2 and a half hours, and I surprisingly have no problem with that. To the point that if you look at times this game has been played in January I am at the #1 spot!!! My friend Jeff (who owns the game) doesn't log his games or he would have the spot!

RATING: 3.5
After playing this game and trying to decide what rating I wanted to give it, I was a little surprised it got such a bad rating. However, I can think of several reasons why I don’t want to play this game again, and I’m going to list them:

1)	First of all, it’s waaay too long for what it is! It takes 2½-3 hours which is probably 1½-2 hours too long…
2)	The area control part doesn’t work at all; you don’t score much points from having the majority, it seemed more important to hold onto the good point spots.
3)	The cards are extremely unbalanced and, as a consequence, way too random.
4)	The random card draws when being the scapegoat can hurt you extremely much or you can go unharmed.
5)	It’s nearly impossible to keep an eye out for your opponents and what their cards do.
6)	There are a couple of weird actions; “take 1 coin” truly feels like a wasted action
7)	What you do in the beginning of the game is more or less pointless as the cards in the last few rounds are so ridiculously powerful and change the state of the game so much so that everything you have done in the first 2 hours feel pointless! This, along with the long playing time and the random and unbalanced cards, are my biggest concerns by far – and they are huge problems!
8)	A minor niggle is that we ran out of cubes several times and had to use replacement parts…

So, as you can tell a rating of 3.5 actually does make sense. What I did like about the game is the way you could boost you cards by playing more of the same type of cards. The majority track was a good idea but didn’t really work in practice. Even though the random card draws make for completely different games each time, thereby increasing the replayability per se, Dominare is certainly not a game I would like to play again.

RATING: 6
Weirdly similar to my own design, though I think my own design is considerably more interesting. I'm normally self-effacing when it comes to comparisons like that, but this is one instance where, because both games tackle similar problems, I feel like I have some ground to stand on. Both Pax Pamir and Dominare are tableau builders which power area majority games.  But the emergent alliances of Pax are swapped out for action-chains and volumes of special powers and card drafting.

But, I have another issue as well. Dominare suffers from a common problem: if X isn't interesting, 2X will be.  And thus, the various majorities and scoring systems and bonus and card powers are just heaped onto the game until the whole mess seems like a viable game.  

That's too bad because there were some things about the game I liked quite a bit.

RATING: 3
Fails on many levels (for me, of course). Primarily there's just too much text. The game is card-driven, and every card has 2-3 special abilities, not counting 4 stats. And whenever you get cards, you do with with a choice of which to keep, which means you have to read a LOT of abilities. It's bad enough trying to figure out what abilities YOU have, and it's nigh until [b]impossible[/b] to keep track of all the abilities of everyone else. By midgame, each player has about a dozen unique abilities available only to themselves. They're all public, but there is no iconography, so you have to either be able to read small print from across the table, or ask. But in reality, what really happens is that players just start doing random stuff that feels completely devastating and surprising, and all you can do is say, "oh, nice card". The feeling is complete chaos. Then there are event cards that typically affect the player who's first in turn order (somewhat by virtue of selecting the most "expensive" character cards, in the currency of exposure), but they're sometimes good, sometimes bad, to wildly varying degrees. The cards also let the same player change values of regions, which may or may not be good for them, depending on what regions come up. 

Oh, it's a territory control game at the core. But the territories only score once, at the end. So there's a lot of beating each other up for pretty much no intermediate purpose. Sure, there are minor benefits for control, but only one or two of the 8 regions have an ability that rivals the character abilities after round 1 or 2, and thus there's a lot of "it doesn't really matter" until the end, when things get super chaotic. 

Overall, highly frustrating, even though in my one game I over doubled the score of all other players combined (5 player game).

Fun powers and tactics, but way too chaotic for how long it is.

First impression: Seems like what cards you end up with have more control over the game than your actual strategies and tactics.

RATING: 8
This game is fun.  I've enjoyed it with 2 players and with 4.  Both amounts were fun but I can see how the 7th season powers can be a bit unbalanced with only 2 players.  I think it can drag a little if people aren't paying attention.  It can also be challenging if people suffer from AP.  But I love the strategy of this game.  It's great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice game. I'm not wild about the drafting, but at least you only have to draft for half the game, and can supplement your cards pretty easily. Very confrontational, and full of very powerful cards. The cards get more powerful later in the game which I like.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Have had this game on my list of "to pick up" for quite awhile. Saw that copies were disappearing from stock in some stores, and it didn't look good for reprints so bought it. 

Enjoying the theme, the conspiracy aspect of play, the management of luck with strategy with minimizing exposure/maximizing power and influence mix this game has. The mechanics are pretty sound. So sound in fact that the pretty rich theme sometimes gets lost in how to juice things for a win. But if I keep the theme in mind, it is very fun.

Update: still enjoy it. Have to keep in mind the chaos that unleashes in 6 and 7th season- the more powerful players in the conspiracy really do shake things up, but simply remembering that you are setting up everything for those final two seasons keeps the game fun.

I won my one play, but only because other players were pounding each other into the ground while I layed low. Part El Grande, part Magic: The Gathering. There's a nice area majority mechanic but I found the area actions to be pitiful compared to the character cards' actions. I don't think I used one until the last turn of the game, and then it was one of the Slum regions. 

There might be a little too much going on here than is necessary. But, then again, I did enjoy the game. Potential here for some slow play, as players must decide which cards to hold at the beginning of the game. Then, again at the half-way point, go through a 7-Wonders-style card drafting in hopes of getting characters that will synergize well with the characters they already have. 

I think the event cards need to be more consistent wrt penalty for the scapegoat. It would make the exposure battle more interesting. As it stands, one player could wind up being the scapegoat for a couple of turns and be lucky enough to not have any events harm him, while everyone else who was scapegoat gets punished each time.

I would have rated this a 7.5 after the 4th turn.  From there everything went downhill.  It slows up considerably as you have more cards and the powers of the 6th and 7th cards are way too powerful.  90% of my final score came from cubes placed in my last three actions.  90% of the score from the last half of the final round.  Everyone in the game was similar.  The swings took away all strategy used for the first three hours of the game.

Waaaay too long for the level of randomness. It's two + hours of implementing plans that (a) will make a difference of only a few victory points at the end anyway and (b) are too easily ruined by the card draws or by the other players, especially if you make yourself a target by seeming to be doing well.

I haven't tried this with only two players. I can imagine your plans mattering more in that version.

You also have a dizzying number of cards that each permit one or more actions, and most of those cards are unique. I am not a fan of that sort of game.

This game has some interesting ideas.  However, I found it somewhat frustrating and less fun that I hoped.  I felt very powerful in some ways but handcuffed in others.  Plus the game is very long.  I kept thinking I could have played two games of Chaos in the Old World instead.  However, this may be more a reflection of my personal preferences than the game itself, as it is a pretty good design.  I do like the way the game accelerates right up until the end.  It just lacks the fun factor for me.

Mixed feelings after my initial play. I really like the area control aspect of the game and the variety of cards. With that said, it seems a bit swingy and some cards are overpowered. This seems to be how the game was designed though and it rewards those who draft well and draw. Also, you can gang up on the leader a bit. Game play is a bit long and I think some of the variants could help to fit this within a 2-2.5 hour window.

UPDATE: Played a second time and I really want to like this... but just can't. The game is too long for what it is... 7 rounds of posturing that takes 3+ hours only to score once at the end of the game. You question why you go through all the early rounds only to have everything undone several times over. Two ideas to improve the game
(1) Start on round 4. I would just start with the Agent draft and play 4 rounds, so you start at slot 4. Most of the really fun and powerful abilities come in the later slots anyway. Some Agents may not be a useful if you cut the early rounds out so they could be removed.
(2) More scoring rounds - if the game is shortened to 4 rounds I suggest scoring after the 2nd round then again at end game. Easiest way to do this is to score the same way both times, but could mix it up. For example, after the 2nd round only score for box control, then at the end of the game score normally. There's a number of variations that could be tried.

January 2014, after one play.

Area control is usually a sweet spot for me; El Grande and Tikal are among my favourite games. Dominare delivered on its first outing, a three player game. I like the conspiracy theme and the character cards, there's a real feeling of building a coherent conspiracy.

The card selection processes and the factions mean that and Dominare has a much stronger strategic component than El Grande's (superb) focus on tactical opportunism. 

Based on one play, I don't agree that Dominare is a chaotic experience in which the Turns 1-5 are made irrelevant by the last 2 turns. Not at all, in fact.

I'm sure I'll have some more thoughts after a few more plays, but so far, so good.

June 2014: After a further two plays. A very enjoyable game which marries ample theme with an excellent area control / card drafting set of mechanics. The vibrant presentation helps. The game state can change rapidly, so opportunism is required, but there's plenty of scope for a coherent strategy, such as Swamp VP Booster, Canal Infiltration or Senate Dominance, depending on the available cards. Big fun, but not a game I would like to play every week. Perhaps once every couple of months would be ideal.

This game is so close to greatness. However, the end game is just too chaotic and undoes the first 70% of the game. I didn't want to believe those comments when I heard them at first, but the more I played the game, it's totally true. 

If I were redesigning this game I'd do the following, and then I'd rate it 8.5 instead of 6. Only have 6 seasons with none of the ridiculously strong season 7 powers. Then only do 2 actions in the final season instead of 3. The 2nd is an easy house rule, but the first makes it a totally different game. Oh well!

RATING: 7
I did not get the hang of this good, solid strategy game till the last round, mainly due to lack of understanding of game scoring (altering the district values altered not only the cost, but the VP's as well!) & of actions in the game (all actions could be agent actions, not just one of the actions), still I was quite taken with this game.  First of all it's pleasant on the eyes and it has a mid-game draft that really boosts the game,  

Cons:  In our 3-player game running out of influence cubes was a repeated issue.  The quality of the components is very good, but because of the cost, running out of inexpensive little wooden cubes just seems unforgivably skimpy.   If I purchase the game, I will add more, with grumbling.    As in El Grande (a game I consider the Granddaddy of this genre) it's an advantage to know the cards, of which there are many. Having to read & re-read the cards, slows down the game.  I do like Dominare much better than El Grande.  I kept confusing 2 of the symbols on the cards, and wished they could have been more intuitive and marked on the board. 

I think my rating will go up with play (despite the puny amount of cubes).  Great potential for enjoyment in this game.

Dominaire is an area majority game where the rules are fairly straightforward, but the complexity is mostly in the cards, and there are A LOT of cards.  I was stunned to realize that the 96 character cards are almost all unique, each providing 2-3 unique actions, and each with its own artwork.  If you think the array of options while playing games like Le Havre or Ora et Labora is dizzying, stay away from this one.  By the end of the game, it's possible to have about 30 potential actions for each of 3 actions I can take in a round, and when combined with the fact that each of my opponents (up to 5) will each have their own mostly unique set of actions as well (depending on their cards), it is easy to be completely overwhelmed.  This game almost requires the user to ignore their opponents' cards - it's just too hard to keep up with everything that's going on.  

Having said that, the mechanisms and idea behind this game are very cool.  I love the way that each area's value can be modified over the course of the game, making it important to be a contender in some areas and not necessarily in others. I think the idea of tying a series of games to a single theme featuring many of the same characters is awesome, and it's fun just to look at the artwork on the cards and try to understand the backstory of each character.  

The cons for this game are that there's just so much going on that instead of feeling ultra-strategic (which it could never completely be given the very significant luck of the draw with the cards), it feels quite chaotic.  It's also very long: I played one 3-player game where we were trying to be quick and it still took about 3 hours - I can hardly imagine playing with 6.

Nem sikerült az elsőt teljesen végigjátszani sajnos.
Vegyesek voltak az érzelmeim. 
Tetszene a területszerzés és az lcg-k egyvelege, mint koncepció. A játék elején még nem is lett volna gond, csak annyi, hogy nagyon-nagyon nehéz elsőre átlátni, hogy mi történik. Annyi az infó a kártyákon, hogy képtelenség még a sajátjainkat is lekövetni, nemhogy a másikokét. Ez mondjuk pár játék után enyhül, az azonban biztos, hogy ehhez a játékhoz kell legalább 5-6 party, hogy tényleg élvezetes legyen.
A nagyobb baj az volt, hogy teljesen irreálisnak éreztük a kártyákon lévő 6. 7. körös képességeket. Kb, mintha addig semmit se számítana, hogy mit építesz, mert úgyis jön az atom. Szinte csak tiebraker az első hat kör és a hetediken múlik minden. Ez elég nagy csalódás volt, kicsit úgy éreztem, hogy halál feleslegesen szüttyögtünk felette 2 órát. :(

There may be a couple of nice ideas hidden in there but on aggregate the negatives far outweigh those. Perhaps most importantly, the game is very, very long and at the same time so chaotic and in a constant state of flux that the first half of the game (and possibly even more than that) doesn't matter much at all since points are scored only at the very end.

The crucial decisions for the players lie in which characters to use for their tableau but that is an undertaking that is both pretty solitary (building synergies between your own cards) and somewhere in between taxing and futile (there are lots of different card powers to read and absorb, and ideally you'd also need to take into account all the abilities of the other players as well).

If you have a couple of hours to kill there are just too many better options to ever put this back on the table.

This game really surprized me with how good it is. The many character cards can be overwhelming on your first play and the cubes representing influence in various districts didnt really work for me.

However Dominare really benefits from repeat plays and once you know what to expect you can plan and strategize in a way that is A very deep and B very satisfying.

I wish some of the turn 7 abilities weren't so swingy bordering on gamebreaking but in the big picture i'd have to classify that as a nitpick.

Excellent game!

Scales hideously.  This is a problem because while the system is sound and interesting, two players is not dynamic enough, but four players is utter, stupid chaos, with the late round cards obliterating anything you've done previously.

After racing through the rulebook, I got the impression that I would hate this game. Just started with a bad impression as I really dislike rulebooks that over-theme the rules instead of keeping everything clear. Also, from what I could glean, it came off looking like a bloated and overwrought area control system. By the end of the game, I actually liked it quite a bit more than I thought I would. Obviously, the "fun" is in building your group of people who are completely unique from everyone else's and trying to do the best with your special effects while also doubling-down on areas just at the right moments. For the variety of people that you can choose from, I
there was a lot to think about and it is wholly what made the game interesting. But there are just one too many things about this game I don't really enjoy that makes me not want to play it again. First off, it's waayy too long for what it offers.  Also, the fact you only score at the end means that you're fighting for 2 1/2 hours over a board that will very much change as cards and Events are played, as they can be quite swingy.  If you're having the best of luck with card pulls and events, you might have a slight advantage in position by the end of the game, but was that really worth the majority of the time you have to invest in this game?! As well, as much as I enjoyed putting together my group of people, it really does feel like some cards are better in certain situations than others, and so if you draw the right cards at the beginning of the game or at the draft, you're going to have an advantage.  (It's not wildly swingy, but it can feel that way.) Lastly, you can play sooo much better and more strategically if you know the other players' cards, but to take the time to read everyone's cards and consider their effects would slow the game down to the point of frustration, so nobody really wanted to do that.  And player order in the game right at the last turn can be pretty swingy as no-one can retaliate against the last player.  I get there is balance between the degree of card effects and the "exposure" you get (which can mess up your plans) and I'd like to think the game was well-playtested enough that they balanced this stuff out. I haven't played enough to detract points for the built-in OP of certain cards, but I do know that (again) for the time you invest in this game, it's a little deflating to only have your work pay off at the end.  I also won by one and only game of this, and I can say I was in a laughably bad scoring situation for most of the game.  The very last round and I was on top and one of the players who was far ahead got decimated and couldn't really score for anything. It felt a little... funky.  Anyway, that's all I'm going to say about that! A game with interesting mechanics, but a little too convoluted and a little too long for what it offers.

Handsome game- thematic & aesthetically pleasing game board & nicely illustrated cards. The sheer variety of cards representing agents with individual abilities is what makes this game different from others in this area- not sure if that's a good thing, though, as there are just so very many personages that one can not keep track of the other players' agents- even with the information available (exposed), particularly because the text on the cards is small. The game only really matters during the final seasons.  You have to set yourself up for it, but exactly how? And is this fun? Nope, since it becomes so chaotic.

RATING: 6
A simple area control game set in the Tempest environment of Love Letter. Players draft and play cards (representing their agents in the intrgues of the city)  to generate counters with which to populaye and control each district and provide special abilities.

Unfortunately the good ideas and mechanics are let down by the admin of the game - with so many actions written on the cards that players place in their tableu, the game drowns in text - this gets worse with more players. Additionally some of the card abilities are much better than others and the "scapegoat" mechanic, although thematic, can be very unbalanced.

Some excellent ideas that fall substantially short in execution - bugger, it has potential - it could be an 8 or 9 even.

Cards, art, tokens and board are all good.

I love the tableau building of your "conspiracy" (and love that concept). The area control is stressful and much less enjoyable by comparison, but it does give the tableau a greater thematic and mechanical purpose that in terms of sheer design that I really like. But the game is extremely long, which limits the chances of it ever coming out.

I'd love a card-game-only version that only focused on building your conspiracy. In terms of theme, it's interesting as-is, but I can easily see this fitting the Cthulhu Mythos as well or better (and so probably being more marketable).

You will get 7 game rounds to take two actions each. The early rounds do not matter at all. I do mean "not at all". The actions available during rounds 6 and 7 can completely undo the sum of the actions you took in rounds 1 through 3. Since there is only scoring at the end of the game, this means that the early rounds are pointless.

In round 1, you may have an action that says, "Lower the Canals VP by 1". In round 7, there is an action that says, "Increase the Canals VP by 8". This completely undoes an entire game.

My score is based on a 6 player game. I was in two minds to not rate it as I don't feel like I got a true experience as I believe the game should never be played with so many players.

I had way too long between any actions and when it was more action it was just a case of placing a couple of tokens and then that was it. Very unrewarding and a disapointment. I did click a 5, now whilst typing I'm reducing it to a 4.

With a further play of say only 3 players, I see that score going up slightly.

While the game has some interesting features, the winner of the game is entirely determined by the combination of luck in card draw and who gets screwed the least, both of which are nearly impossible to mitigate. Simply put: if other players don't want you to win, then YOU WON'T WIN, PERIOD. This kind of negotiation game is fine if it's under 45 min but 3 hours with 5 players makes it one of the worst gaming experiences that I've ever had in years.

Absolutely love the theme! Unfortunately an immature design ruins it. 

Placing blocks is booring, I constantly want to recruit new conspirators because I hate my combo no matter what I have. Recruitment decisions are very hard yet yield few results. Reciutment and interaction abilities tend to eat up the few player-actions, and is very painful. Draft mechanics require you to analyze, understand and plan your game from start to finish, in advance.

I originally gave this game 10 because I wanted to like it so bad. Measured in fun per minute it really only deserve a 5.

After one play, I really dig it. It takes a while to play, particularly for your first game, but it's a rewarding experience as you gradually build your line of cards and fight over the various districts. It is a tense game, with the back and forth of influence, the tight action restrictions, the district VP manipulation, the exposure track, timing your actions, etc. but never becomes too much to enjoy it. I look forward to playing this again.

Pretty sure we did not get the rules right on this one.  It's a fairly heavy area control game set in AEG's fictional, Venice-esque world.  I really liked the theme in this. Each card had a distinctive character and it was easy to imagine a story behind each one, and the way that the different districts of the city interacted was really cool.  However, the rules were pretty confusing and we weren't at all sure about how and when their powers could be used. The endgame scoring was really weird, as well; it didn't favor me, but I'm not sure I would have liked it even if it did.  In any case, the game was too long and probably a little more convoluted than it needed to be--disappointing, since it showed quite a bit of promise in the first half of the game or so.  (1 play)

Great area control game that has variable player powers, variable area powers, tons of options for actions each turn,and no combat or dice. The sheer amount of actions available,esp after turn 3 or 4, makes this a very thinky game, yet it plays pretty fast without a lot of AP. Smooth mechanics that make sense for the theme(using "theme" loosely,it is a euro...)keep the game moving along.

Area control resource management points grab.  Although initially very positive about this game, the other games in this shared universe (Courtier, Mercante) have been serious disappointments, making me a bit leery of getting this (as such, I'd really like to play it first given the chance).  Medium desire to gain as a trade.

Not sure how this game got published without playtesting, horrible parts of the game that are like pulling teeth, definitely a couple hours long (of pain and suffering) instead of the time on the box.

Only played once or twice but I seriously enjoyed the game each time I played, wanted to immediately play again, and consider it one of my favorite games.  The idea that you are provided with a special power depending on which districts you control is an addition to area control games I haven't seen before and is quite fun.  The card drafting and interaction is also super fun and works well with the theme and area control mechanic. I think this game is underrated and surprised to see it not getting better reviews.

RATING: 5
I admire a lot of what Dominare is trying to do.  I'm not willing to play it again, but I want to give it the benefit of the doubt as an attempt at innovation.

Dominare is an area majority game where scoring takes place only at the end.  The regions can change in VP value due to player actions either on their cards or the Scapegoat's special event actions. (The Scapegoat is the player whose conspiracy to seize total control of the city-state of Tempest is most widely known.)

Probably the most interesting part of the game is in selecting the members of one's conspiracy; character cards have synergy with other cards which share a type.  This is fun from the perspective of arranging one's own tableau, but the synergies can actually serve to shunt players into different regions and thus reduce interaction.  Disincentives to player interaction in an area majority game are a problem and I can only assume an unintended consequence.

I also found that the powers used in the later rounds were sweeping in their scope compared to the early round powers.  While a progression from less to more powerful abilities isn't out of the ordinary, the magnitude of the change is such that players in my game felt there was little point to the early rounds.  I agree - the early-round decisions are interesting in the moment, but seem pointless compared to the game-changing powers of the last round.

If this game were 90 minutes, and if I were a big area majority fan, I might consider playing it again.  Unfortunately neither of these is true - but at least Dominare is trying to push the envelope.  Even though the game at large doesn't really work for me, it's certainly not forgettable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
One solo 4 player game only, to get the rules. 4 player felt about right, with enough competition for space on the smaller side of the board and not too much downtime - I suspect that with 5 or 6 it could run too long.

While it's a souped-up area control game at heart the cards add a lot. There's a mix of tactical thinking ('what can I do this turn?') vs longer term planning around agent recruiting and deciding which areas you want to compete for and which you want to drive down.

The special abilities of the districts and (in particular) agents give you something to think about, as does the trade-off  between whether you want to play high value agent cards and risk being the scapegoat or play it safe and steady.

I'm looking forward to playing face-to-face.

Looking at the Tempest theme artwork aside this has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the fabulous Love Letter, although it does have a majority scoring feel in common with Courtier. I think I prefer this one, as while Courtier is a bit shorter it seems very chaotic in the end game when the neutral cubes come out thick and fast.

This is a really good area control game with a little bit of 7 Wonders thrown in the mix. You draft agents, each with their own special abilities, which get played, one per round, and can build on each other to place influence on the board. If you control a majority in any given area, you get the use of that area's special ability. It's a lot of fun, with a decent amount of player interaction.

I think this is the best received of the Tempest series? Personally I'm more fond of Canalis, despite that game being ugly as all get out.

Good, clear graphic design and artwork. Some unnecessary fidlyness and terminology. Kinda easy to pick up and hard to master. Initial draft may be hard for first time players to evaluate properly but rules overcome this by including suggested combos for those cases.
Some luck present but so very many options that you'd have to get really unlucky to sufer from it.

If there was a way to rate this game any lower, I would
I wish I could have the THREE HOURS!!! it took to play this game. With all of the randomness in this game the first 5 turns of the game are absolutely pointless, and any time I placed cubes on the board the next player simply pulled them off again making anything I did a waste of an action on both of us. All the players are fighting for the few good spaces on the board, which made for an even worse gaming experience. All that work and I got only 10 points. Really 10 f%^$ing points? >:(

In all my years of gaming I have never wanted to flip the table and rage quit more so than playing this game.

It is a long walk through a hot desert for a small drink of water.

Ok, so it took a couple of bumpy games before the rules clicked, but now I really love it! Is it better than Courtier? It very well could be, but despite sharing similarities it has a very different feel to it. Courtier has a more concentrated fun around the majority abilities but Dominare might win out by its broader scope.

The rulebook and cards confused with a lot of loosely phrased stuff like ”Use a Plebian action” restrics to ones own (plebian) agents while ”Flip an agent” is allowed to be used more as an attack on your opponents. A player-aid with some more explicit reminders (”only spread when canvassing”, etc) would have been very helpful from the get-go.

I don’t mind the ”swingy” endgame at all. If you had, say, the King (he gives 4 actions – which is huge) you’d have to set him up with the right agents beforehand to make the most of it. As long as everyone sort of gets what needs to be done it escalates for some great headbutting.

Other than the rules, the other important issues to consider would be its length and cutthroat nature, which doesn’t always sit right with my group.

When you talk about Area Control games, usually only one game is mentioned [gameid=93], and that is with good reason. It is the grandmother of all area control games, sleek and efficient at what it does. But its one drawback is that it isn't very thematic. Sure you are spreading your people around to have them take over parts of Spain for you, but really what the hell does that mean? So we come to designer jim pinto's entry from 2012 Dominare. At the heart of the engine of Dominare is an area control game (stick people in blocks to control them. Control the most blocks in an area, control the area). But there is also another level to Dominare that increases is thematic cred. You are trying to take over the city-state of tempest (just like El Grande and Spain), but instead of just some abstract cards that allow you to do an action and places some dudes on the map (why am I getting to do that action? why do I get to place them there?) here you are are building a city wide conspiracy that can span from the lowest of lowest classes (a dog) all the way up to the King himself and everything in between. This conspiracy will be revealed one layer at a time, and at the end of the trail you will have a puppet master who will most likely be wielding powerful abilities that can change the face of the political landscape of Tempest. This mechanic is simply awesome. Each character will also give you influence to place each season he/she is in your ranks, and probably some money as well. While the game can go on a little longish (especially with the high number of players) it doesn't feel like you are playing anything over an hour. The game has a really nice pace to it that just keeps gathering steam until the penultimate turn when Bob makes a move and takes over the church from under every other player, and wins the game. While I no longer own El Grande, I may not need to get another copy like I believed before I played Dominare.

Played this AGAIN, against better knowledge. Still a messy heap. 

Massively unbalanced actions, far too long for what it does, incredibly tedious cube placing, pushing and exchanging, crassly random events, mediocre artwork, and, surprisingly, still quite enjoyable. Could have needed a lot more playtesting and balancing. As in quite a lot.

I would like to really like this game a lot, but I really don't. Theme and storybuilding are somewhat nice for the first hour.

It's been a long time since I played a game I hate as much as this one (sorry, Kiri and Jim). Three hours (minus rules) of "I put a cube here/I take away your cube there" in which only the second half (if that much) seems to make a difference. And if you have someone going after you in turn order who's intent on screwing with you, there's damn little you can do, other than waste a precious action (and a lot of cash) trying to move yourself in the order. An absolutely miserable affair and the best part? My final score was: ONE. So I only got one more point than some guy who instead spent those three hours watching TV or taking a nap or sexin' somebody or whatever. 

I guess there's a good idea of a game here but man, don't ask me to find it.

Great game.

An tableau building and area majority game where you obtain an initial set of cards and then play a card that gives you the ability to add control markers to various buildings.  Some cards are very powerful enabling you to take control of whole buildings.  Once you play a card you reactivate it each turn.  Also there are negative points at the end for the most "exposure".  Higher exposure gives you more power.  

After one play, the same is a little chaotic with significant swings in luck.  However it is fun.  I like some chaotic games where it it can be swingy. 

If you don't like high luck games, stay away, but otherwise a fun cool game that reminds me of lighter Bruges.

Same look and feel as its younger brother Courtier, this Tempest game uses similar mechanics to create a more complex and chaotic outcome. It is another game of majority, but this time each section has variable value, with bonus points for the zones of a section with a range of -1 to 3 points. The exposure track is also important, players will constantly need to monitor their exposure and weight-in on playing cards with higher value or lower value with possible less impact. Perhaps too chaotic but very enjoyable.

At it's core, Dominare is mechanically a wargame that tries really hard to pretend that it isn't a wargame. I really enjoy the way the area control conflicts are played out in this game through the spread of influence, and the potential for interesting synergies between your drafted agents is great. However, the game tends to be incredibly long and draining, despite the fact that each player makes a very limited number of decisions, and it becomes clear about halfway through whether or not you even have a chance at winning.

The fun part was trying to combine the different agents and to find a strategy. It was also possible to somewhat "roleplay" the agents and the actions they did. The area control part was less exciting and very standard.

Quite a good majorities game. I like the cardplay mechanism. Not too much new or special either. I would like to play this game some more. Rating can go up or down. Slight worry that the card actions later in the game become very strong, real game changers. Time will tell about the balance.

A cool area control game with looooooooooooooots of character powers that interacts in fun ways. Way too complex to remember all possibilities for the opponents so you just have to let that go and play.

As with other area control games it's quite aggressive and plays very slowly. Still a neat game though.

Played it for the first time 2 years ago in Essen, courtesy to my friend Babis, and loved it immediately. Bought it recently and played it again. Seems complex at the start, but once it gets rolling everything clicks in a tight game of intrigue, card playing, area control conflict with lots of meaningful choices. Has a little too much 'screw you' for my taste but still a good game.

I found it hard to plan out a real strategy.  In large part, I think this is due to the huge number of cards and card interactions.  Many cards can be swingy, but there are so many of these that it all balances out at the end.  This may go up after repeated replays and a feel for all of the available cards.

Oh Man ~ this is a mean, cut-throat, take-that game! You build up your influence in an area for 5 seasons and in seasons 6 & 7 *every* *single* *player* gets their hearts broken and their plans torn asunder.  If don't mind that, it is a nice combination of tableau building and board action.  The cards have tremendously entertaining abilities and beautiful art.  On the downside, the board art and area abilities are just boring. Also, the catch-up mechanism in the game is strangling.  It actually stifles really clever play.

After an hour of rules explanation plus an additional three hours playing a 5 player game of Dominare, I can safely say I have no desire to return to this themeless cube-pusher again.  With scoring only at the end of the game, early round actions are essentially meaningless.  I can't tell you how many times I would put down my cubes on a spot, they get replaced, I replace those back with mine, and on and on until we see who happens to be left standing at the end of the final round.

Some reviewers rave about the "theme" of this game. but I didn't experience it.  If you like area control games with wooden blocks, I recommend you stick with El Grande.

This is an attrcative game, and actually fun to play, but strategically it is lacking something. Very powerful card powers can change the whole position late in the game, with no defence possible, so it feels very chaotic and subject to the whims of the other players. I'd like to see some benefit or reason to control of the districts during the course of the game - e.g. a benefit each round to the one who controls it without this using up an action; then there would be some reason for the plays you make.

As it stands, I would play again but generally prefer to choose other games where I feel I have some control over the course of the game.

RATING: 4
In a 7 season game, each player puts down an agent with abilities from season 1 to 7. The trick is that the higher abilities can only be available if they match the season, or less,  in which they are played. This is an area control game where the agents let you dump cubes into the board. The agent's abilities get more powerful and more chaotic as the game progresses. Some spots on the board are worth points as well, creating dog fights for certain spots.

It's a long, fairly chaotic game. The cards can lead to many rules questions and it's just not my type of game. If it was somehow shorter it would be less painful perhaps, but I couldn't really stomach the almost random abilities of various cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Chaotic to the extent of sheer pointlessness, this area control game is jam-packed with events and abilities that make cubes disappear en masse and undo several turns of labor in the blink of an eye.  You get bonuses for majority control in a region, and with my army of knaves and laborers I should have been king of the swamps, but no.  Grab one of those nifty region bonus power cards and watch it disappear before your next turn.  The sad thing is, there's actually a lot to admire about this game;  the agent cards and canvassing system could be put to much greater use elsewhere.  But the ridiculous ease and frequency with which strong board positions come and go simply make Dominare a very long and very unpleasant crap shoot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Too chaotic. A lot of moving cubes and cards around for very little effect, or effects that are immediately negated. A lot of choices, but many of which seem pointless. Not enough meaningful decisions for me. I can see what  it's trying to do, but I don't think it's succeeding, or doing anything new, despite the 'Tempest' gimmick.

Not sure what to make of this. The main thrust of the game is area control and feels like it’s come 10 years too late to the party – solid, but uninspiring on its own. The conspirator characters breathe life into the game – they’re well thought out and nicely characterised. (I like that AEG are trying to make their own world and story, which is always difficult as a known franchise is instantly more gratifying). The character powers are well varied and the way they interact and change depending on their position within the conspiracy provides interesting avenues to explore. Good stuff. But, the way they interact with the board is frustratingly chaotic and creates huge swings with regard to board positioning. Add the arbitrary random events and the board is in a constant state of flux making planning extremely difficult.  Perhaps the characters should been used in something else as they don’t shine in this and only end up making a slightly dull area control game slow and frustrating, when they should make it fun.

Interesting blend between El Grande and Innovation-type card interactions. Dominare is a bit too resplendent with choices and can easily lead to over-wrought AP and game length, but it's certainly fascinating in what it's setting out to try and achieve. Here, more than anywhere else, the Tempest theming and backstory starts to make a little bit of sense.

You know how Love Letter is quick and easy to play? This game is its evil twin: bigger, meaner, and a bit clunkier. Dominare wouldn't be such a drag if it flowed a bit nicer and the game play/rule book was a little more intuitive. It feels like a collection of odd mechanics (card drafting and area majority) than a solid foundation of a game. Overall, the worst part of the game is that all of the character's later-game abilities are SO much stronger than the early-game ones; it almost renders the first four rounds useless. As mean as that sounds, Dominare has some great elements. I loved the storyline and backstory to the characters, the artwork is gorgeous, so Dominare brings the atmosphere of intrigue and power struggle to the table in spades. And, while it can play long with 5-6 players, I didn't notice the passing of the time which only means that I was constantly engaged with the game, even when it wasn't my turn. I feel like that's a very hard trick to pull off with a game of this magnitude. All in all, I'd be willing to try it again with a time limit to a player's turn or something.

RATING: 7
It starts off as an area majority affair, and then you realise the points earned by owning a majority are pretty minor compared to those on offer from just securing point-earning spaces on the board plus that which you lose from using too many powerful cards (ie the over-exposure penalty). It's still a tit-for-tat game, but there is interest in the card selection and the combo's you shoot for, which is the main hope for replayability. Otherwise it's pretty vanilla and still suffers from the usual area-majority king-making, collateral-damage issues so it's never going to be a high-rater, but it could turn into an occasional pull-outer.

This is an area control game with an economic system and lots of character cards with unique abilities.  There are definitely some neat concepts in this game--you really have to focus on playing your character cards in an order that will get you the most cubes, in different places, and get you income, and also special ability text, all without going up too far on the exposure track (which will lose you points end-game).  Unfortunately, all this is not tied very well to the "so-what" of the game: scoring victory points.  You only score once at the end of this very long game, and the bonuses for regions is a) winner-take-all, and b) probably not very many points anyway.  So it feels like you're fighting for hours and hours to get a very slight advantage in the end, and the board state is so changeable that it probably doesn't even matter what you do early in the game.  I don't really understand the -1 spots either--it doesn't really take many of these to cancel out any points you'd be getting from controlling an area.

A bit swingy and chaotic feeling halfway through the game. A bit unintuitive and no real player aids are also annoying. However there are interesting things going on in this game and I am intrigued. Interaction is high for this type of game. There are some mean things you can do to other players. The better player won by a long shot. New players will get destroyed as they won't really understand what they should be doing to set themselves up for a win. So there is a bit of a learning curve. This is a game that you have to learn as you go. 

I'm interested in playing it again, but not enough to purchase at this time.

edit: New players will get stomped. The game fully "clicks" after the second play. The better player will win. knowing how to draft your cards well and create a good line up is essential to success. 

There are a lot of things to consider in this game which can lead to some serious AP. Unless your group is patient this game should not be played with AP prone individuals. The game should take only two hours to play.

Last game (so far) from the Tempest - Line and this is clearly the most heavy one and also the one who takes most time to play. And there it goes wrong for me in this game. This is really a game where AP will be an issue as you have to figure out which agent to place in which round, which ability to use when,...

It's also a 'screw-you' - game as you want to gain majority in most of the districts. However the value of a district is something you have less control over. Some agent-abilities let you increase our decrease those VP, but if you use your action to increase the VP of a certain district, it will attract the attention of the other players, who will use there actions to take it away from you. So that's something to do for in the last round if you're almost certain that you'll controll it at the end of the game. So the most variation of the VP comes from the event cards, who can also be very drastic. I guess that's together with the playing time (which is an issue that can be resolved by playing it enough with the same players) my main issue with this game, that the swings can be too drastic, that the chaos factor is just too high for my personal taste.

Half of the game is fun, implementing interesting strategy through ranking cards and activating powers. Unfortunately, the game out stays it's welcome and the high ranked powers are chaotic, imbalanced, and game breaking. By the end, any progress players have made is almost instantly nullified. Since scoring is strictly end game points, playing for three hours just to see who gets a game winning card is very frustrating. Dominare has only the illusion of strategy, ans at it's core it's a game about luck of the draw and being the player who benefitted the most from actions that are nothing more than basic king-making.

Hits a lot of the right notes for me. Area control, special abilities, direct interaction, and an engaging and coherent theme. With the euro market moving away from my personal preferences, it's nice to see the occasional game still being published that suits those of who like a game with sharp elbows and a bit of heft.

The real clever aspect of this game are the agents and their tiered abilities activated at different conspiracy ranks. Do I place weak agents in the first few ranks, or play more powerful agents in terms of influence and income but forego their high-rank abilities? The abilities are so varied and there are so many agents that there will always be surprises. And surprises are good.

Then there's the whole sub-game of exposure. The better the agent and more overtly powerful its abilities, the higher the exposure. And the penalties for high exposure are dramatic - often decisive. That senator who rains down influence onto the city may not be worth the candle if it means you lose 9 VP for having the highest exposure, while that mid-rank plebian who sprinkles influence around the swamp districts is a very attractive option if it keeps your exposure low.

And Dominare has other deft touches. The mid-game hand draft. The ability to neutralize - and rally - agents. Whitewashing exposure, using inspire to target blocks outside your home districts, setting up agent combos, the evocative artwork and characterizations.

Tracking all agent abilities for all players is unrealistic, and if you're the sort of person who has to know all variables before making decisions this probably isn't a game for you. However, the worst surprises can be avoided if players announce the highest ranked usable ability of each agent as they're placed onto a conspiracy. 

A couple other minor quibbles are the relative weakness of the district special abilities (which are rarely used, in in my experience), and the narrow utility of money.

It's area control about placing people in city districts collecting points and getting powers of city districts. The big thing is a huge deck of character cards which will fuel your strategy. On one hand you have to manage and think about how you'll place these characters and which go best together (like Libertalia) But it's a serious game and you're confronted by weird character powers of other players and you have no idea what they do. Sure you could read them all, but who has time for that, the draft phase itself is a reading exercise. 

It's okay, I had fun with some character names. Might be interested to play again because of sheer scope of stuff possible. But then again, nothing really shines through. Building your own tableau of special powers is not that interesting to me. Main problem is that while information is open and you could play for it and play the game more confrontational, it's nearly impossible to do - it's just too much stuff. I prefer games which are more focused and in your face. 

Rating down to 1.0 because: uninspired. Yeah it's a crime.

This is an area majority game with a few twists: a few card drafts; the cards (agents) have different powers usable in different turns (better actions later); and there's also apparently a story here, although I didn't see it on the first play (there is a LOT going on, and I was focused mostly on just learning the game -- I didn't really look at the characters or flavor text at all).

Everyone else had played the game before, and I properly came in a distant last place! But wow, this was a fun game! It's area majority at its essence, but all the little twists give you many things to consider: when to play your agents, which of their abilities to activate, etc. And most cards are unique, so you have a lot to learn the first time around! Definitely looking forward to playing this one again!

[b]--- Rules Summary ---[/b]
[u][b]Setup[/b][/u]
* Choose a board side (by player count and desired competitiveness). 
- The board shows 8 districts, each with 3-15 spaces for cubes and worth varying VP
- There's a District Ability card for each, placed nearby; these go to the player controlling (having cubes in more spaces than any other player) the district
- Also, an Exposure Track (sets turn order, high-to-low)
- And a District value track, showing the current VP value of each district; place cubes at leftmost space

* Deal each player 8 agents. Agents:
- provide income (crowns) each turn
- allow you to place influence cubes onto the board, into the agent's district
- increase your exposure (advance your marker on the Exposure track)
- have traits (keywords); agents of the same trait work well together
- have abilities numbered 1-7 (may only be used if the agent is positioned in rank at least as high as that number); some powers are activated when the agent is revealed

* Each player 
- chooses 3 agents; the discards are shuffled back into the deck.
- gets 5 crowns


[u][b]Game Turns[/b][/u]
* 7 turns (Seasons) in game

* After after Season 3, deal 8 new agent cards/player; draft till 5 agents added to hands, and discard the rest

* Each Season:
[u]1. Conspiracy[/u]
- players simultaneously add an agent to their ranks 1-7 (in rank matching current Season); if someone has no cards in hand, draw from top of deck until find legal play
- some agents have Reveal abilities, resolved in turn order
- advance on Exposure Track by values shown on agents
- set new turn order, from highest to lowest Exposure (ties broken by highest single exposure agent); Scapegoat = first

[u]2. Event[/u]
- Reveal top card of event deck
- Resolve each section only if number shown equals or is below current Season number
- 2 district icons are shown; the Scapegoat increases the VP value of one of these, and decreases that of the other, by the amount shown

[u]3. Canvas[/u]
- in turn order, players use face-up agents in Rank 1; then Rank 2; etc.
- collect income value of agent
- take as many cubes as influence value of agent (Nobles get 0; skip this step)
... +1 cube if either adjacent agent shares a trait
... place these in a single space of that agent's district (Artisans may go anywhere; Shadowmen may spend 1 crown to go anywhere); if another player's cube(s) present, each cube cancels another
... may spread cube(s) into spaces adjacent to original space at a cost of 1 crown/ extra space (but may only spread into 1 other district) (Shadowmen may spread into any space, ignoring adjacency)

[u]4. Actions[/u]
• Starting with Scapegoat then in turn order, players take ONE action; go twice around (x3 in Season 7)
• Choose one of these actions:
- [u]Use Agent ability[/u]
... may only use agent once/Season (tap it or otherwise mark it)
... only if the ability number is less than or equal to the agent's Rank
... if ability places cubes, no spreading allowed
- [u]Use District ability[/u]: once/district/season (even if control of district changes); flip card over till end of Season
- [u]Buy/place influence[/u]
... each cube costs as many crowns as district's current VP value
... place in one space (no spreading)
- [u]Rally[/u]: flip all your face down agents face up
- [u]Recruit[/u]: draw 2 agents, keep one and discard the other
- [u]Replace Agent[/u]
... remove one of your agents Rank 1-6 from the game
... replace with another from your hand
... add 1 to Exposure
... resolve Reveal abilities immediately
- [u]Whitewash[/u]: Adjust your Exposure up or down; each point costs (Current Season + 2)
- [u]Gain 1 crown[/u]

[b][u]End of Game[/u][/b]
After 7 Seasons, sum:
• +VP from controlled districts
• +VP from spaces on board (worth -1 - 3 VP)
• -VP based on Exposure:
... player(s) with most Exposure: - 1VP / 3 exposure
... player(s) with least Exposure: - 0
... other player(s): -1 VP / 5 exposure
• Highest total wins! Tiebreaker = most crowns

RATING: 8
I am a big fan of variable player powers, especially when the game has a large amount of content, so of course I was going to like this game.

This is at its core a basic area control game.  There are several districts on the board made up of several blocks each.  Each block is worth a point value at game end (including negative points) and each district is worth a point value for the controlling player as well at game end.  The district values will change throughout the game though (while the block values are static) and controlling a district during the game also gives you that district's power as an available action.

Where the variety and variability of the game come in is the huge deck of personalities you play.  There are seven rounds and each round you will play one from your hand.  Each personality provides the user with income, influence they can place on the board, and different special abilities.  This game can be very mean since early on and throughout the game you will be competing for control over blocks and districts and many of the special abilities are used to outright attack your opponents.  There are also a few other concepts that add more meat to the game like special events each turn and the exposure gauge that has various effects on the game.

The one negative I will say about this game is it is long.  This game especially will bring out the worst in AP prone people since there is such a huge variety of personalities and different actions to take each round and you have to plan a decent bit in advance what kind of strategy you will take.  Even for people not susceptible to AP there is still a lot of text to read and by the 7th turn each player will take 7 individual canvas actions then 3 other actions in turn.

But for the amount of content in this game the time spent is worth it in my opinion and as players get familiar with the personality cards and the different strategies in the game the pace will pick up.

I want to give this game more love.  You can really get into the feel of masterminding a conspiracy.  The agents having variable "ranked" powers and synergy between the agents/co-conspirators were an interesting mechanic and might have been better as its own proper game.

Pros: If you have a love for the chaos and the "take that" it is in here.  A great deal of player interaction for a euro type game (To be honest it plays more like a hybid of genres).  

The game was very playable from the rulebook (once you got through it)

Cons: I have mixed feelings on the importance of the first half of the game.  The cards at the higher ranks tend to greatly overpower those of lower ranks.  Very hard to identify the leader during play, which can lead to inadvertent "kingmaking" especially due to the many cards that affect players positions on the board.

The third tempest game I have played. And this one is an area majority game. To me this felt mostly like a less streamlined [thing=93][/thing]. You are restricted as to what areas you can place followers in and the value of the areas can change. There's a couple of things that are obviously different from El Grande of course.
I quite liked this game, but the play time of over 2 hours is a bit long. But that may have been due to all of the players involved being first timers.
I'd be happy to play this again, but the first play didn't stand out for me.

Initial rating: 6.4

After 1 play with 5 people: Some interesting ideas, but this is way too long for a game that is decided by unbalanced cards and massive swings in the last round.  At a large table we could not see what everyone else's cards could do (but making sure you knew what everyone else could do would have added to the time). A group of experienced players could knock this out in a more reasonable time but the problems with the final rounds (and only end of game scoring) remain. Not having periodic scoring to make the earlier rounds mean something (anything) seems a huge mistake.

I'm not usually a big fan of area control games, but Dominare was pretty interesting.  The different leader abilities and different regions shift it to more strategic than tactical, which I like.  My one play was with 6, which made it nearly impossible to follow what everyone else was doing, but I think it would shine with 4.  Exposure is pretty interesting and I like how it was implemented.

A good aggressive game, similar to Dominant Species, but with simpler mechanics.  I played 6 player, and really felt that it was probably too many players.  I think 4-5 would probably be best for this game.  Our point spread was 28 for the winner, 11 for second place, with 3 between 0-9 and one at -4.  We probably, no definitely, did not check the leader and it cost the rest of us.  All in all though, I thought it was fun, and would play it again.

Interesting game, let down by the degree of chaos that makes any sort of planning difficult and the fact that luck of the draw with the cards can mean a player's agent abilities become useless because someone else drew cards that do better versions of actions in the same districts.

First Impression:

A unique and thematic area control eurogame.

Pros: The character system is amazing. It creates tough decisions as you need to choose carefully when to "employ" each character plus it creates a good narrative at the end as your "conspiracy" is finalized. In addition, it greatly boosts replayability. The action selection choices are also solid and the area control aspect is less chaotic (which is a good thing) compared to other area control games.

The "texty" characters are at first intimidating and player choices may cause analysis paralysis more that in other games. I'll think it twice before playing this game with five or six players, and even with three or four downtime can be an issue. In addition to that this game doesn't manage to get away from the chaotic kingmaking aspect of area control games. Although this is somewhat less present here, the 7th round character abilities are way too powerful to plan for, especially considering that they're revealed just before they're applied.

This was a pleasant surprise for me. Even though it's from a category that I dislike, I'd gladly play this game again.

Very nice and very thematic area control game. It is well designed and has many desirable features that you don't see in other games of this type. Excellent use of the conspiracy rank feature!!! Excellent game! It does not get a 10 because as usual with 6 players it becomes long. Plays best with 4 players or 5 players that know the game.

I'll preface my remarks on Dominare by saying that we had a bit of a rules muddle.  The person teaching the game glossed over a couple of points and a number of the players misunderstood a few points.  In particular, it wasn't clearly explained that you can only perform an agent's fifth level ability if the agent was place in turn five or later.  The explanation that exposure counts against you at game end by either 1/3rd, 1/5th, etc. was understood to mean that you'd get docked 1/3rd or 1/5th of ALL your points.  And there were a few other minor rules issues that mucked things up a bit.

What I liked: 
The artwork and board design
The idea of the agent's having special round specific abilities
The area control fight through the first 3/4ths of the game

What I didn't like:
The fact that 3/4ths of the game is largely meaningless in terms of who wins
The chaos that occurs in the last turn of the game
The length of the game, given how chaotic it gets at the end

My game played out like this.  I spent much of the early game dominating the senate, the atheneum, the medium swamp and trying to fight for the church.  By the midgame I had lost the church and atheneum and while I still had some presence in both, they were impregnable fortresses.  Neither was particularly worth much though.  I kept my hold on the medium swamp which was slightly valuable.  I beat off invasion attempts in the senate and managed to get a stranglehold there, which was a juicy plum and the bulk of my likely points.  I also managed to completely dominate the large swamp which was virtually worthless.  I never had a presence in the canals or the merchant's quarters, which were solidly held by Ken and Kiri respectively.

Jump ahead to the end of the game.  I was completely wiped out of the large swamp.  I was virtually eliminated from the senate.  I held on to the medium swamp.  And that impregnable church?  Well I completely dominated it.  

How did I do that you ask?  I have no freaking clue.  I literally have no idea what happened to all the cubes there as I was distracted while someone else took their turn.  All I know is that a wall of black cubes disappeared leaving vast stretches of the church vacant.  I used a piddly second level power to place a single cube in four territories... seizing the juiciest area on the board, a four point area, and two two point areas and taking control of the entire church.  This is equivalent to the army marching band wandering in looking for replacement trombones and being proclaimed the victor in a war they didn't know was taking place.

I did well overall, coming in a relatively close second, but almost none of my points came from anywhere I predicted nor did I get many of the points I had anticipated.

The chaos was funny, I admit.  However, after four hours of trying to play a thinky game, I don't want silly randomness and chaos.  If the game had been half an hour I would have been happy with it.  But this game breaks the time/randomness ratio for me.  I'm not sure it's quite as bad as its reputation in my gaming groups, but it isn't a game I particularly want to play.  I liked a lot of the ideas in it, but it just didn't work.

I don't understand why this game doesn't get the love. 

It's one of my absolute favorite games. 

Lots of folks have complained about it being too swingy. There's no question that it swings, but it fits the theme so well. 

I don't know if that's intentional or not, but it seems to me that building a conspiracy to take over a city-state should have wild swings. 

This game can smack you. Hard. You also have to be willing to be awful to your opponents, even when you feel like they're far ahead. Showing mercy will lose you the game, so it's certainly not for everyone. 

All of it is executed so well, though. 

I never feel too bad when I lose, either, because the game forces me to be such a jerk that I sort of feel like I deserve to lose. 

But I feel deliciously devious when I win. 

I don't know of any other experience like it.

WAY too long for what it is.  A couple of hours of "I play two cubes and then you play two cubes to cancel out mine" is freaking tedious.  I did like the way the agents worked though.  Maybe a game could be spun off from just that idea?

RATING: 6.5
Fun in a chaotic sort of way.  However, the game would be better if you just skipped the first half.  The actions in the second half of the game are tremendously more powerful than the actions in the first half of the game, so the first half just really doesn't matter.

Just a suggestion, but give everyone three conspirators, let them seed the board with 10 cubes, and then start with the agent draft and play rounds 4-7.  You'll cut an hour off the game and the results won't be any different.

Mean area control euro game placing influence cubes in key districts of the Tempest city-state that eliminate other cubes 1 for 1. Advance your conspiracy by drafting initiative order special agents while trying to maintain a low exposure. This is the 3rd game of the Tempest series.  Too aggressive for our carebears.

This is for all Tempest games (save Love Letter).
Don't play with Meta Gamers (I enjoy playing with Meta Gamers though) they will rip the turn order with why the placements there and anything else they see as odd and will eventually ruin the game.
Matter not whether it is area control of Courtesans, or of a city, as in Dominare. And don't think you can sneak a Merchant stock market game in without them saying lets just play "For Sale".
These games were hits with historical buff and surprisingly non-gamers. Even Dominare!
EDIT- 09/13
Bigger sleeper than I thought. 2 people in my game groups have now purchased this. I asked them why and they both basically the same thing; It is easier to learn than the rules teach, also that after a few plays it was on their minds well after playing.

Has some twists on the usual area control game.  However, as the game progresses and the abilities can get stronger, control of the various sections can take dramatic swings.  With 6 players, it can get quite chaotic.

Brain burning.  We fouled up some rules first time through.  Needs another try.  Initially just shy of a 7.  Not bad, but not great either.  Potentially too many extreme swings late in the game.

After second play:  Better, but event deck completely destroyed one player midway through the game.  Would possibly be okay if this player was the scapegoat, but he was not.  Not terribly fond of that sort of artificial catch-up mechanic.

Oddly, my gaming group seems to love this.  I'm the only one among the players that felt sort of "eh, not bad, but there are better options everywhere."

I really wanted to love this game. The components are beautifully, and the networking mechanism is a really cool one. Yet, the game play falls completely flat.

Possibly my favorite game of all time. Always fun, always interesting, never too long, never too short, always different. I had to have this so now it is easily the most expensive game I own (I got the wood box but not the giant hut, that's just ridiculous!) and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Absolutely beautiful in every way and I like the new twists with the boats and such

RATING: N/A
In Taluva, players attempt to successfully settle a South Sea island slowly emerging from the ocean waters as volcano after volcano erupts.

Each turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.
Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.

The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.

A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...

The Deluxe edition contains the basic Taluva game at increased size, as well as the following new expansions:

    Ship expansion: A new wooden piece, which can be placed in lagoons, adjacent to settlements
    2-Hex tiles expansion

What sells this game for me is how fast and easy it is to play and how gorgeous is looks on the table. I always have a great time playing this, whether I win or lose. Playing a game with these colourful large wooden pieces and thick carton tiles is almost a meditative experience.

I've always enjoyed my original version of Taluva, so when the deluxe version came out, I bit. I wasn't sure if I loved the game enough to justify the cost, but now that I've finally brought it out in all of its splendor (and my wife, who had not played it before, REALLY enjoyed it), I'm glad I have it. If this was more than a straight re-implementation, it would have made my top ten for the year.

Taluva is a simple game. Place a tile, then place a building. There are three building types, each with different placement requirements, and the first player to place all of two types of buildings wins the game. If players are playing well, then usually the tiles run out first. If that happens, then the player who played the most temples wins, followed by the most towers, then the most huts (or total buildings by that point). The game provides lots of crafty opportunities for unexpected moves and blocks.

The game doesn't change with the deluxe version, but there are some add-ons for the deluxe and KS deluxe.The game plays best with 3, so the 5th player expansion is a bit of a waste. The starting tile and double tiles expansions are small changes. The sail expansion adds another building type - boats that are placed on open gaps in the tiles. (I hear this 4th "building" unbalances the perfectly balanced three basic buildings and I'd believe it.) The best addition is the board, which sets boundaries on your tile placement, forcing players to build up rather than out. That can make the game quite a bit more challenging. You can resize the board for different levels of difficulty.

Overall, though, the additions are fairly disposable. The core game is as excellent and superbly designed as always and the huge tiles, beautifully crafted buildings and the multi-level island that grows before you as you play make this version an absolute delight. At 3 players, this scores a "9", but scales lower at other player counts. I probably won't play with anything other than 3. That, and the fact that the additions are a mixed bag, has me scoring this a point lower at 8.

I had a hell of a time with this game when I played my very first game as a 4 player game which was chaotic and hard for me to see what was going on.  I eventually decided to give it another go which resulted in me getting the Deluxe version which is fantastic to play.

During a holiday I introduced my wife to this game and now and then she requests it. Normally she is not really about abstract games, but the rules are simple and the game looks beautiful. She made sure the rating was high! ;)

I like the game, want to play it if requested, but wouldn't pick it myself. I don't exactly know what it is, but I miss a certain spark when playing this game. I have a bit of a 'carcassonne feeling' with this game (a bit of a 'boring' feeling).

On the other hand, the game always needs your full attention on the state of the board and the remaining buildings of you and your opponent, because before you know it, your opponent(s) will pull ahead. That is the thing I do like about this game.

The English translation errors/typos in this first Deluxe edition rules are extensive. I really hope a fresh set of rules will be available for us to print out in the files section here on the BGG. The old rules from the original English verion of the game are much easier to read.

Looking in particular for a version with the wood box (not the hut) but really, any version of the game would be nice to have. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Pros:
* Very fast setup and cleanup (less than 2 minutes)
* Beautiful to play and look at
* Excellent components
* Works perfectly for 2 players
* Very quick turns, especially if you draw your next tile at the end of your turn instead of the start.
* Good level of interaction (blocking, sharing, destroying huts) with very little negative emotional impact.

Cons:
* Can't think of any

Comparisons:

While mechanically quite different, it shares some  "emotional mechanisms" with Carcassonne, Kingdom Builder and COGZ. You're drawing a face down tile and doing the best you can with it, but the tiles really just offer opportunities to be more or less efficient with hut placement. There are no "bad" tiles. As in Kingdom Builder (depending on the rules in play), you may be trying to build a larger group of huts or keep your huts split up or blocking the other player from joining or spreading out. The comparison to COGZ is because it has a similar feeling of wanting to avoid overly benefiting your opponents when you set yourself up for a good turn. Any time you build a level 3+ tile for a tower, you're potentially giving the next player a perfect place for her own tower.

Played five times now. This is one of the only games that has ever caused my wife to comment, out of the blue, "I really liked that game!" the day after we played it.

The game is beautiful while you're playing it and when you're done you've created something that really looks good on the table. The components in the deluxe edition are stellar (super thick tiles) and the little unnecessary player and graveyard boards add to the aesthetic.

About [thing=188076][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=188076][/thing] is a new printing of [thing=24508][/thing], being basically the same game with two new expansions: Boats and 2-hex tiles. Therefore, most of what I will talk will be for both versions.

[thing=188076]Taluva[/thing] is a tile-laying game in which players put Huts, Temples or Towers, each with their own restrictions and requirements (Temples demand a settlement of at least 3 Huts; a Tower must be placed in a third-level tile).

The game has very simple rules, but the placement of tiles, the actions of expansion of the settlement and putting other buildings, allow for a good amount of depth and some strategy, mixed with a lot of tatical play, since you don't know which tile you will be using next.

There is direct interaction during play, since the addition of second and third level tiles can, and usually do, cover and take out Huts of other players, normally preventing them from being able to build a Temple. However, is unlike that the damage done is too harmful: is more often simply a bump in the road, a delay. as settlements can't be fully destroyed. Yet, as [thing=188076]Taluva[/thing] is pretty tight, is possible that a small delay of one turn can mean losing the game. It is the nature of the thing: one mustn't losing opportunities.

The production value of this new printing is great: the tiles are thick, sturdy and colorful; the pieces are of wood and nice to the touch; the box is huge and keeps everything in place - but is a hassle to put everything back once the game is done.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
As per the description: each turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.

Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.

The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
The main one is: where to put the tile drawn. This has several considerations: board state (the formation and what the others and you have on the board and where), what the player wants to do (expand to add more Huts, put a Temple or a Tower, block someone else, split a settlement, etc) and, finally, what she doesn't want to do (this is important, as laying a tile can be more useful to the others than to yourself, as they can use it to place tiles in the second or third level).

[thing=188076]Taluva[/thing] usually requires forethought from the players: you are laying the foundations of your next plays right now. This isn't a complex and intricate demand, but sure carries weight and is key to doing well.

If using the 2-hex expansion, there is also the decision of when to use it. Every player can only use one of them during the whole play, so while one might prefer to wait, this can mean losing the opportunity of placing one or more of them, as there are only one per player, and they are all different.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Great production value;
- Language independent;
- Easy to teach and to play, but with a good amount of depth in the gameplay;
- Tight game, with the decision often coming in the final round (and this is a game that can end early, not with a predefined number of rounds);
- Constant interaction and fight for space - the destruction of Huts isn't, normally, crippling or too harmful;
- Short playing time with a good pacing and little downtime;
- Is nice too see the evolution of the board, growing and rising, dotted with buildings.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Big box (for the Deluxe edition at least);
- Mostly abstract gameplay.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like playing a little more complex version of [thing=822][/thing]: [thing=188076]Taluva[/thing] has more types of things to add (three or four types of buildings), more ways to place tiles (in three levels), and is more agressive, but the heart of it is the same: lay tiles and put stuff on them. There is no cost to this, no economy - at the most a small amout of resource management: with meeples and Huts (though finishing the Huts can be good, is also very possible to not be able to build in one of the next turns and be eliminated). It is hard for someone that enjoys [thing=822][/thing] to be displeased by [thing=188076]Taluva[/thing].

Overall, [thing=188076]Taluva[/thing] offers a fine mix of simple rules, good depth, a nice amount of interaction, and a lively pacing, with short downtime, all put in a pretty to look at and to handle package. Recommended!

From what I can tell, it's identical to its older, much smaller brother (if you exclude the ship and 2-hex expansions), but it's still a nice, fun game of accomplishing your goals while blocking your opponents, and gambling on whether you can pull off an instant win or need to secure the tiebreakers. Good stuff.

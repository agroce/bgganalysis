Catch the flavour of the world of H.P.Lovecraft. We like it very much because of all the possibilities and the theme. We don't play it like a CCG, where the player with more money usually wins. We made three fixed decks and we play with them.

You basically play a card and then try to play cards referenced on that card. I guess sometimes you get in a fight?

RATING: 10
The Best CCG around. As a fan of Lovecraft's (and others) Mythos stories, I am a bit biased; I would guess those not interested in the Mythos creation would rate the game lower. The game does have it all though: gameplay (solotaire, 2 player and multi-player) and theme; adventure and story creation; combat and discovery. Makes Fantasy Flights' Call of Cthulhu LCG appear 

Feb 2018. Edit out FF barb; game Good, I just like Mythos better.

Have complete booster boxes (packs open) of LotN, CR, EoMU. Also big pile of Dreamlands (Complete set?).

Fue de los primeros juegos de cartas, con un montón de ideas nuevas, la victoria a través de contar una historia, hoja de personaje, centenares de cartas en el básico, aliados, monstruos, localizaciones objetos... tres expansiones ya proyectadas antes de salir a la venta el básico. Demasiado pretencioso... El Magic es mucho más "sencillo" que todo eso y sin embargo es una obra maestra.

El arte de las cartas es muy regulero. Ilustraciones maravillosas de Sullivan o Gibbons junto con auténticos zurulos de pintores de medio pelo. Aparte de lo caro que era cuando aquello. 

En lo que respecta al juego, funcionaba pero tenías que poner muchísimo de tu parte para poder disfrutar. Con dos mazos básicos casi era imposible jugar y estabas obligado a comprar sobres sí o sí. Una pena porque la idea de basar un juego de cartas en los Mitos es genial, pero no de cualquier manera. 

Por cierto, supongo que para la editora del juego en España, JOC, fue la puntilla a una mala gestión. Quizás el Señor de los Anillos de cartas diera dinero y pérdidas, pero Mythos seguro que solo dio pérdidas.

Actually, I rather liked this. I got a bunch of cards for cheap and it was amusing to play a few times. But, like most CCGs, if you don't have opponents its pointless.

RATING: 5
The gameplay of Mythos is story oriented, but the cards don't usually create as great stories as they maybe could (or as Arkham Horror does). A very different kind of CCG though. I started playing Mythos in highschool when my gaming group found Call of Cthulhu RPG. I still have the cards but haven't played in years.

RATING: 8
It shows its flaws from being an early CCG, but it's so much more original than most of them.  Deck building is cumbersome and kind of a pain; you really do need to own multiples of the entire set in order to make it easily playable.  However, Mythos sticks much closer to the source material than any other card game I've seen, and it really does feel like a story unfolding.  You'll be fine with buying just the Limited and Unlimited editions (if you can find them) -- Dreamlands and New Aeon take the game outside the realm of necessity.  Card quality is very nice, but the artwork can be hit-or-miss.  Trying to hold onto your sanity is so futile!

This CCG has a devout following, sadly this doesn't make it better. It easily falls into a solitaire for each player, decided only by whom finishes his solitaire game the fastest. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably my favorite CCG. Sure, it's often multi-player solitaire, but it's very well-themed multi-player solitaire, with strong storytelling elements. If you like moderated storytelling, Lovecraft Mythos, and deck construction, this game is for you. If you don't, well, I have no idea: I've never tried playing this competitively.
(No points deducted for collectibility, because I'm being arbitrary today.)

I love HPL and consequently the theme here, but gameplay is pretty dodgy and just TOO LONG for a CCG! It only gets a 5 by granting bonus points for theme and above-average artwork.

Great environment, but game play is heavily luck dependant and not very rewarding.  Completing a story just isn't as much fun as beating down your opponent with monsters (which ruins the game).

Seems to play well, need to get into customizing decks though. Plays okay with the solo rules too!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
It helps if you're familiar with the Lovecraft background, though driving your friends insane is an attractive objective for any game! A CCG which plays well multi-player and somewhat like a traditional game - one card per player in turn. A shame it's so much work to buid a story deck but the 2 Player starter pack is a good shortcut. Medium weight (or maybe more) if you're deck building - simpler in play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
CCG based on storytelling.  Turns go by quickly but each one has many options.  No chance outside of luck of the draw.  Minimal timing issues since few things can be done out of turn.  Games are quicker with well-tuned decks, but deckbuilding does require an extensive collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
unopened box or two of boosters from the Necronomicon set.  Would love to play more but as always, no one wants to play dead ccgs.  Never understood why there HAS to be new stuff for an established game to still be "ok" to play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The only CCG I can see myself playing.  Have lots of pre-made decks, and works very well for groups of people - everybody just grabs a random deck.  

Supposedly this works as a solitaire game, want to explore that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An exquisite CCG, with a core mechanic involving meeting story prerequisites to earn a set amount of points. Fans of Lovecraft will love the expansive themes that draw from his work in minute detail; gamers will love the gameplay; and everyone can appreciate the beautiful artwork that adorn the cards. No other CCG looks so beautiful when presented in a display book.

Also, one of the very few games to issue a softcover book covering the design of the title, cardlist, and strategy guides - something which so many other games could have benefited greatly from at the period.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 6
Best CCG I have played.  Great fun if your familiar with the Lovecraft Mythos.  It really plays into the stories with the art and card descriptions. Not really a direct conflict card game, you attempt to complete your story/mission before your opponent drives you insane while your opponents do the same.  The first set is very well done although the expansions really didn't do much for me.

Brilliant CCG plays out the same way a good story might unfold. One of the best of the day with players taking the roles of various period era investigators to try and reveal the creeping doom in H.P. Lovecraft's world.  Movement, equiptment, combat and story contruction are all very well realized.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
By far my favorite CCG.  This one plays very fast as you only play one card per turn.  You fill your hand to 13 cards from your deck of 52 each round so you also blow through your deck very fast.  It has the atmosphere of telling a good horror story.  I have 8 decks ready to go and when my girlfriend (it is her favorite ccg also) and I get together we each draw one at random.  I will break down a couple of decks and make new ones every once in a while to keep things fresh.  After reading what others say about the game I am the desinting voice that says you can easily combine expansions for a good deck.  My New Aeons deck is about 33% cards from the first set and the unlimited expansion.  Favorite card - Going Postal.

This is one of the better CCG's -- even if you're not into Lovecraft.  It plays quickly, with each player playing one card, and then their turn is over.  It has a great Story atmosphere to it.  Deck construction is complex, though.

RATING: 6.75
Mythos is a CCG, a blasphemous creature from the black void of time/space which sucks money and time into oblivion.

On the other hand, Mythos is a Cthulhu CCG, and it does a fair job of taking items and events similar to those in the Lovecraftian stories (or direct from them), and making them into a competitive game where players try to accomplish adventures and avoid madness.

So, an oxymoron of sorts, a thematic and reasonably enjoyable CCG.

Have to play this some more, but will start it at a 6.75, currently my highest personal CCG rated game.

It was pretty much a dueling type of CCG ,but with an Arkham Horror feel. Sure you had a mission to complete ,but most of the time you would be driven insane before you could finish it. In fact that is how you mostly won was by killing off or driving the other play mad.

The artwork was nice ,but the game was a bit clunky.

This is an amazing game that Chaosium just couldn't figure out how to package and market to it's full potential.
The first set and expansions (1920s) were great, but could have used some fleshing out.
The basic set/preconstructed decks were not very appealing, and didn't show off the system well.
I found the Dreamlands expansion to be somewhat lackluster.  While I loved the X-Files/Illuminati/dark conspiracy feel of the New Aeon set, it has limited utility as a stand alone, and is different enough from the basic set that many of the cards don't fully integrate.
If Chaosium had stayed with the classic 1920s theme for the next major expansion (and put off the Dreamlands and New Aeon until later), I think the game would have been much more accessible.
Even so, this is one of the best card based games I've ever seen or played.

If this game was re-released with some well done preconstructed decks (more along the lines of Blue Moon or FFG's LCG format than a CCG), I think it would be more successful.
The "story deck" mechanic would also lend itself to spin off games for just about any pulp fiction genre - I could see this working for Tarzan, Detective, John Carter of Mars, Golden Age Sci-Fi, etc. - with the added ability of mixing the cards from each genre together (somewhat like a blended Munchkin game).

Never played this one but being a Lovecraft fanatic to the point of needing a padded cell, I had to pick it up.  I read the rules & the game came off as a solitare game played with another player--having to complete your own adventure cards while an opposing player tried to hinder you with cards from their deck & vice-versa.  Haven't played FF CALL OF CTHULHU CCG, but I'm sure it's better.  My score of "5" is based on what I've read in the rulebook about gameplay.

Love this game. Bonus: Story line is key and it makes the setting a priority in its design. It's also very original in using a 'story deck' that helps tell the story. Drawback: Little player interaction makes it more of a race. Check out the stand alone double deck set first. Spend the money only after that.

A very nice CCG from the world of H.P. Lovecraft. And the starter set contains two very good prebuilt decks. For once you could actually play some good game with just one starter.

Never actually bought into this game myself, but a friend let me build and keep several decks using his cards.  I like the 'storytelling' aspect, and the feel that you're playing both a group game and solitaire at the same time.  Plus, the Lovecraftian setting is always entertaining...

RATING: 9
The sine qua non of cerebral CCGs. It's like the best of interactive fiction though, you'll love it or hate it. If you're into HPL, just travelling around the locations of the stories, picking up allies, artifacts and spells, is fun in itself. I can spend hours just looking through the cards!

Love this game and will hopefully be posting some of my Deck designs.  They may not work the fastest, but they are usually built around specific themes which make the adventures fun to play.  I.e. "Do not forsake me Oh my Darling" which is a tribute to High Noon.

RATING: 7
Storytelling CCG using the Lovecraft mythos.  One constructs decks around "adventure" cards that tell the story and require various locations, events, characters, tomes, and so on to be in one's deck.  The game's a 7 when I have a decently-built deck, but it can get very frustrating when I don't have such, moreso than other CCGs I've played.

Looks interesting. I've always liked things Lovecraftian, though not as fanatically as some. Now that I've acquired a couple starter sets, it looks like a good game that I hope to try soon. If I enjoy the game, I might look to pick up some more cards to add variety. Thanks to gamer-stu for trading me a batch of cards.

I picked up a couple boxes of Legends of the Necronomicon boosters on eBay, so I guess all I need now is an opponent.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

Very thematic game of card-based narrative adventuring. Closer in spirit to MECCG than other MTG-clones as you are less focused on dueling an opponent and more involved in completing your own adventures before your sanity runs out or your opponent outdoes you. Not for those looking for the ultimate ultra-competitive head-to-head challenge. Stellar deck-building experience

RATING: 6
A game of solitaire that you play at the same time as an opponent.
The idea with adventure cards is an interesting idea, until someone builds a deck made to disrupt the completing of said adventures. Really, playing this game in a competetive way ruins the game...
Also, the various adventures are very unbalanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Curiously enjoyable.  Probably completely pointless if you aren't also a Lovecraft fan.  If you are (like me), it's pleasurable fun to work through the stories.  Not really a very competitive game, but more like a fun pasttime.

In my opinion the greatest CCG ever, and among the greatest games ever regardless of type.

RATING: 8
Holds a special place in my heart for high theme that is played out in the game very well. Strong system, good deck building, dynamic play between players without the rigid "stalemate" feel of Magic, event cards and the storytelling aspect of play put it above other CCGs for me. Alot of my love for it comes from the Cthulhu mythos theme, however.

I used to play and GM the Chaosium Call of Cthulhu RPG when I was a teenager working at a comic store. When collectable card games became popular, I collected a couple of them simply because I was in "Collector Mode". No one else I knew collected them, so I never got a chance to actually play the game. I've dug out my old stuff recently in a fit of new game-related interests, and I just might force some friends and/or family to try a game with me.

RATING: 7
In a deck, you'll want two of each card that has a keyword in an Adventure. So if the Adventure calls for a PROFESSOR, you'll want two allies with the PROFESSOR keyword. 

Meanwhile, many Monsters Join Monsters of the same "species". For example, if you have the Adventure that requires 20 points of Monsters in your Story Deck, you'll want as many high-point Monsters that Join, and they will usually only Join their own "species", not other Monsters. 

Some "zones" don't have enough Locations, so you end up having more than one copy of a Location in the deck.

And, then, if you have a few hundred cards, why not make several decks? I have several cards that I have many copies of, just because they're in several decks. Some cards I don't use at all, because they won't fit in any deck.

Basic deckbuilding:
* Each keyword in an Adventure should have at least two cards in the deck that fulfill the keyword.
* Minimize the number of cards in the deck, typically by having Adventures who share the same cards.
* Tomes and spells are useful to shrink the size of your deck.

****

the Mythos CCG is my favorite. Unlike pretty much all other CCGs, Mythos's focus was not to "kill off" the other players, though this was a definite option. As a game based on literature, its focus was to fulfill story elements to score your story. I'm sure the assumption behind this CCG was "Well, our target audience already plays Magic. What *else* can we do?" Unfortunately, the traditional CCG random selection and broken cards didn't help the game, and it died during the CCG glut.

I'm sure had it returned in LCG format, it would stand in good play today. Furthermore, by rotating the story cards in the game, you could have players make fresh decks and new gameplay for minimal costs. It's a shame that FFG didn't pick up this license. 

*****

In Mythos, you want to test out your decks. You can easily create a deck that fulfills the requirements to play the Adventure card (ie. the card that gives you VPs), but then find out you can't play the cards in your deck! So fine-tuning your deck IS a form of solo play.

Also, the cards are imbalanced. An Arkham-only deck is far easier to play than an international deck b/c the international deck requires you to play cards to travel from one location card to another. 

The decks are better if you have a large pool of cards from the same sets to make several decks.

A pretty good cardgame for 2 or more players, marred by the broken Phobia cards as well as more than a few cards with terrible artwork. Otherwise, great theme, moderately interesting game play, and a beautiful Dreamlands expansion. Huge hand size leads to analysis paralysis, especially since players are often discarding and replacing nearly half their cards each turn. Buy a starter, which contains two excellent and balanced decks, and treat this as a nice filler game for two players.

This one is a CCG from Chaosium, where you play your cards in order to tell a Lovecraftian story. It was quite different from most of the CCGs of the time, being a very thematic game of card-based narrative adventuring - not something often seen.

 It is a clever game, with good art and lots of potential. Yet, to me the CCG model is dreadful and the mechanics were taken to higher standards by LCGs such as Lord of the Rings and, the true successor, Arkham Horror LCG.

Not bad at all, just discontinued, made in a bad business model and surpassed.

I am a sucker for Cthulhu and this game certainly scratches a certain itch.  It is extremely thematic and my girlfriend absolutely loves it.  Aslo I am a big fan of playing card games where it isn't always about simply attacking your opponent over and over again.   

 It does have a few problems however.  It is not the easiest game to learn, making a deck can be a true chore, it is a ccg which I think was the wrong format for a game as complex as this.  It is out of print, which is a big problem if your short one card for a story you really would love to complete.  

Despite of all these problems this game really capture the lovecraft world, and you can tell there was a lot of passion put into it.  I will most likely be playing this game for some time.

Like the &#039;losing your marbles&#039; concept.
Only CCG I really got into.

Plays more like a conventional card game than your run-of-the-mill CCG.  Maybe that's why it appealed to me.  That, and the subject matter interested me.

Great game, very closely tied in with HPL's work and really captures the flavor of the writing.

Own(ed) loads of these but just never got round to playing. Have two starter decks, most of one of the expansion decks, a homemade deck and about 150 extra cards.

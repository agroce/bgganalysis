Decent game.  Tends to favor whoever scores first, as you run out of the more valuable swords quickly.  It is easy to have a runaway winner before he even starts making his last sword.

RATING: 6.5
A game that combines resource collection, tile-laying, racing, and card drafting in a light but accessible and enjoyable fashion.

The goal of the game is to obtain the most victory points and this is accomplished by: 1)crafted swords (those that are delivered successfully are full value, all others are half value), 2)collecting valuable art, and 3)each 2 gems that are collected and not converted into swords.  

Gameplay is very simple- each turn you either pick up 2 cards, place a building tile, or move your craftsmen or even more rarely, move one of your craftsmen back to the starting point.  Cards are required for movement, and also to pay for the use of buildings that are not your own, thus taking cards is a necessary turn oftentimes.  Buildings pay out steel and gems (resources for crafting swords), more cards, art, sword crafting, and ability tiles.  The ability tiles come in 2 forms- an advanced movement tile, and dueling tiles.  Whenever you land on the same tile as someone else and there is no "room" for you, you have to duel via card-flipping- to mitigate this randomness, you can acquire the dueling skill tiles.

The game ends when one person gets 3 of his craftsmen to the finish line, and then all other players have one more turn.  This game is very accessible and so it has that "table time" factor which is really key for me- it is also a good gateway game, and very wife friendly.  I think it's getting a bad rap because people don't associate this type of design with a typical heavy, grinding, convoluted Martin Wallace design (which I normally quite enjoy by the way).  I think it's actually quite a solid design, and shows some real diversity on Wallace's part.

A cute and neat little game by Martin Wallace. The game is techfully designed, while the draw-cards provide a just-about-right balance of luck in an otherwise tightly paced worker-placement game.

It's one of those games where you place worker dudes and try to get resources so you can turn them into victory points. It was OK, but just wasn't that interesting. The little gems are a nice touch.

I can see myself getting into this more as I play it more often.  I also think it may go down quite well with my family.  More than anything else it reminded me of Emerald - the theme of collecting metal and gems, the race, the sending people back home after a duel (a bit like the dragon catching them), the game effectively ending when a number of people get home, bonuses (art) for getting near the end quickly (a bit like the first home bonuses in Emerald).

However, this game is less elegant than Emerald, but also more complex (whilst still being quite simple overall).  I like the fact that it's quick and that it holds five.  I like the fact that the duels come more and more into it by the end.  The art is attractive and there's a fine balance between what you decide to do each turn.  It's certainly not one of Wallace's more original efforts, but it's fun all the same.

Pretty much average Euro.  I won my lone game.  It's a game of balance and puzzle-solving.  Collect components to make swords and try deliver them to the boss-man for points and count your victory points when the game ends.  The theme is pasted on, but it's a solid Euro.  If Euros are your thing, you are going to like it a lot.

A lighter and quicker game than your average Martin Wallace.  I love the theme!  The pieces are nice, though the board background is overly busy.  Mechanics are simple but can lead to some interesting tactics.  Theme is somewhat pasted on.  A little connection between the theme and the mechanics, though some aspects are clearly non-thematic.

I like Toledo and enjoy it.  It's probably not going to make my top 10, but it's fun and I'll suggest it as medium filler (30-45 min.) from time to time.

The goal is simple, make 3 swords and get them to the Castle. You place your businesses along the path that leads to the castle and people pay you to use them. The problem is your opponents can use your businesses to get the stuff to make their swords.  So, you have to balance placing your businesses and moving your people, Do you build lesser value swords and get them to the castle quickly or try to make fancier swords but not have enough time to get all 3 to the castle?

Toledo is the first Wallace design that largely underwhelms me.
It is definitely lighter than the "classic" Wallace's games, but this is not the problem, 'cause the late Discworld didn't disappoint at all, with all its light and fun viciousness and thake that aspect.
What I felt lacking was the true concept of fun: while spoiled of all the hard brainwork (a thing I love in games...), Wallace's designs are, I suppose, very dry...
So, Toledo has this problem: at its bone, it is something like the game of the goose meeting Caylus (with the former part being so much preminent), and it is quite boring to play!

Toledo is one of those games that seem to last ages and then, right when you’re ready to collect the results of your long-term strategy, suddenly end, leaving you with loads of resources unused and just a handful of points: it works as a family game but it surely doesn’t appeal to my tastes.

A quick, colorful and interesting family oriented game from Martin Wallace. I think it has been under-rated here and believe there is more depth than it is given credit for. The fun factor is definitely there, it moves quickly, is easy to teach non-gamers and there are several approaches to effective play that are fun to explore. I expect my family will enjoy playing this game and so will I (and they may find themselves drawn into playing some of his other titles such as Age of Industry as a result).

My rating is based on its value as a gateway game as well as solid family fun.

I have only played this two-player, and I feel like the game is fundamentally lacking with two. There are so many open board spaces that just getting your pawns to the castle can be a challenge. Add to this the problem of putting your steel foundries too close to the cathedral, and you may find yourselves with little to do during the second half of the game. Adding more players would probably prevent a "clumping" of businesses so that there would be more options further up on the board. 

All in all, the game is probably too simplistic for my tastes. It felt a little like Candyland for gamers, with too much reliance on luck and not enough paths to victory. I'd like to play this again to see if I'm wrong, but sadly I don't know if I'll ever give this another chance.

As a big Martin Wallace fan, I was really excited to give this one a spin!  However, it turns out that this one was a rather boring exercise.  Place tiles on a track, pay to move to them, and pay the tile owner for the use of the tile for different activities related to making swords.  Overall, it works just fine, but is just kinda "eh".  I guess I'll just stick to Martin's excellent heavier games, and avoid his lighter offerings.

I am impressed with this game.  I think visually it looks great, although the board can look "busy" at times.  There is a deep sense of strategy as you balance out gathering resources, playing action cards, or drawing movement cards.  The fact that you can get "paid" for someone else using your action card is a significant possitive.

Overall, a well done game.

Very nice gateway game.  Nothing that requires too much deep thinking, but the game works very well as a family game and I believe would be a good game to introduce others to the hobby.  Played once so far with my 8 yr. old who was able to follow along without difficulty and really enjoyed the theme.  I like the addition of the El Greco cards that add an additional scoring option.  A 2 player game did seem to be a bit too easy, though -- it was relatively simple to use our own businesses free of charge to obtain materials and we ended up having zero duels.  Not sure yet if that was unique to our game or a factor of playing with 2.  Seems that 3-4 players would add some needed tension.
2nd play - 3 players - definite improvement over 2 player.  I can see where the dueling option could be useful here.

RATING: 7
Some of the Martin Wallace hallmarks are here - scant resources, and having resources that serve a dual purpose (in this case purchasing and moving).

The unusual theme isn't deeply ingrained in the game, but at least it's different.  Players' choices are not easy and planning ahead is key if you can.  The real secret is in placing your businesses - collecting income is just as important as the convenience of moving.

The downsides for me are dueling, which feels silly and irrelevant late in the game, and that the game takes a bit longer than it should.

But on the whole this is a simple game that's easily taught and plays fast once you get the hang of it.

RATING: 5
Players are sword makers, racing (???) their products up to the castle to present to the king.  Players spend their turn to either draw cards, return to the start, or play one or more like cards to move their pawns up through the city.  The shops they stop at provide materials and means to manufacture swords, which are essentially victory points (doubled if they make it to the castle).  Weird game that plays perfectly well, but feels off to me.  Is it a race, a resource game, and why are we dueling at the shops.  Feels a bit like a Weissblum/Moon game from 10 years ago.  Super fast, but super bland.

Mostly an acquisition and luck with a bit of strategy game, but as we found out, the endgame can be lengthened considerably by preventing other players from finishing it until you have enough victory points to win, if you are appropriately positioned.

Quite a decent game with some interesting decisions to take. An unusual theme too, though not particularly reflected in the gameplay. Lighter than many of Martin's efforts, it fits well into the Kosmos line.

A racing game sort of like Keltis das Orakel with a path-like track, where you race to create and deliver swords to the Alcazar. It is as simple to learn and play as Ticket to Ride. The worker placement aspect is fairly interesting but not much else. Probably needs more than 2 players to reach its full potential.

Along the way to presenting the best swords to the king takes place the struggle between the players, simple and with a fair degree of interaction, would be repetitive in two players.

Incredibly boring counting exercise.  Feels like there are a lot of elements to balance other elements that never come into play.  Very rarely a good idea to use an opponent's tile.  Many mechanics are downright anti-thematic

Looks pretty, but plays like crap.

RATING: 6.5
It works, but didn't set me on fire. The players move up the street after placing their shops, collecting 2 resources (steel, gems) to turn into swords (VPs). You can alos collect Goya paintings (VPs), get extra cards, and knock other players down to the street with totally random duels. So very little genuine interaction, a fair bit of luck, and not much to do. Looks nice, but over produced. I would play this again, but maybe with 3 or 5 players, not 4.

RATING: 7
Cool elements in a compact design that plays well and fast.  No turn drags on as the decisions are simple yet interesting.  Seems to be slightly scripted in that the game progresses in stages; early on the businesses are setup, then a bit of hand building followed by a mad dash to get the best swords out.

RATING: 7
I would rate this game higher if one wasn't allowed to reach Alcazar swordless. As in our game this has lead to the leading player trying to finish the game quickly before the others had the chance to react. And since it can take a few turns to complete your sword, your opponent may already be just one more turn away from finishing the game. So that sure needs a house rule fix imo (just stating you've got to bring at least 2 swords to Alcazar f.i.).

There's also a big variety in the time to spend on the different actions, which can lead to a feeling of having to sit out quite a big part of the game if for some reason you need to take a few obvious short actions in a row while the other players all take their time to overthink their actions.

And last flaw might be (not in every game) that by the end of the game you're constantly short on cards, so you end up just taking extra cards turn after turn until you've got what you need to finish it.

But biggest asset is that the race to swords works, and that you can decide which road to success you want to walk. Haven't played it with 4 yet (only 3 & 2), but I guess it will be at its best then. With 2 players I would only rate it a 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Planning a big turn, saving cards to spend on that big turn, some punk sword fights you and sends you back to start.  Just like when you played Sorry as a kid.   I'm not a big fan of games that have a lot of planning mixed with screwage.  It gets frustrating and can feel like a waste of time.  This is a nice game to look at but not my type.

It looks fine until you realize that there is one winning strategy - get the most expensive sword and rush to the castle. Even a family game (and this is one) should be more balanced and allow players to introduce some creative strategies or mixtures of strategies.

If it wasn't for this one treat the game seems fine. But I'm not eager to play it again.

I like Wallace games generally, so I was looking forward to giving this a go.  I prefer his heavier games, although Tyros is a fun little game.  Toledo isn't a bad game.  It reminded me a little of Cartagena and Freya's Folly.  I would much prefer to play Freya's Folly as it just seemed more interesting and had some theme going for it.  Other games scratch the itch better, which places Toledo in the average category for me.

Are you looking for a huge, zero-luck, deeply strategic euro-game?
Don't buy this.
Do you have some friends who only want to play Monopoly?
Try this.
The fixed path and the shops will make them feel at ease.
The possibility to choose the move (which pawn, how many spaces) will make them feel in control.
The "pay-to-buysomething" feature will make them feel more satisfied than the pay-and-pay-and-pay Monopoly mechanic.
They will want to play again. And soon they will be ready for the next step.

Rated after one play with 2 players. Both my wife and I want to play again - it is easy to learn (although the meaning of the duels only becomes obvious in the last stages of the game, at least with two players), yet offers enough challenge to let us want to try again. I imagine it is a lot tighter with more players. I hope we can play this again soon and see whether our initial feeling is right. After the second play, this will probably be down to 30 minutes or so (with two players) - perfect for parents of young children.

Jun08: Well, my wife *really* enjoyed this game.  I thought it was so-so in my first playing.  Despite the board, it's nothing like Caylus, which is a good thing to me.  Instead, it's a short little hand management and race game.

I got annoyed when I lost 7 out of the first 8 combats I got into.  They were all at 50% or better odds too, which really hurt.  I got the horse that let me play one non-matching card per turn however.  I abused the crap out of that to generate just a ton of cards.  Too much MtG theory left in me I suppose.

The actual game is pretty neat.  I don't think it offers any really deep decisions, but it does allow for some fun chatting and game play.

And for a Martin Wallace game, he even laid off the exceptions quite a bit.

After 1 play.

I quite like it, although not so much to buy it.  I won't be strongly refusing when someone suggests it.

Mechanics seems to work pretty well, but the game is somewhere between family game and gamer's game and I can see it might not appeal to either of these groups' lovers.

Additionally I find this game very dry.  Although it was inspired by the theme (as Wallace said in an interview) it fails completely in that respect.  Wallace said it was/supposed to be more complex design at first, that was simplified in the process.. and it shows.  Theme was hurt terribly by this.  And there's NO logic/sense in actions of players comparing to reality.
  But, as I said, mechanics works ok.

RATING: 4
What do you get if you mix a little Caylus with a pinch of snakes and ladders and a random combat element similiar to card game war...holy Toledo! (sorry couldn't resist)  

Not sure where Martin was coming from, or where or what he was on when he thought this one up. Some planning to be sure and at least the play time is suitable for the weight, about an hour for a light middleweight.  Combat of flipping cards is kinda crappy but you can sway things in your favour by specializing if you want.  One thing I really didn’t like was someone could monopolize one spot such as the grab cards spot and if he specialized it can be really hard to get him off it, this was a little broken no doubt about it, even someone not specialized is a pain in the ass to remove with random combat.  

Quite uncompelling, not quite a filler or gateway (might work as gateway but a tad more there than usual for this genre) and not quite a decent middleweight, thus just not that desirable for many people.

Some tactical depth, and I know I botched the strategy in my first play by not placing enough businesses.  The cards are similar to those in Brass, but far more central to the game.  That's an issue for me, as I find the cards in Brass the most arbitrary and frustrating part of the game.  Inability to draw well spells doom in Toledo, and that isn't much fun.

RATING: 5
Toledo is a bit of an odd one in that for as large as the box is and the decent range of various options open to players, a game can end before you finish your first two sips of beer and ask "what happened?". Making it into a race game to create three chintzy swords and rush them to the castle does not make for a satisfying game at all. To prevent this, players need to constantly fight to try and pull each other back and slow things down. It's just not the sort of thing that is all that satisfying of a play tactic, but you feel forced into it to keep others from racing past. The game does make sense and works better than some of Martin's other light games like La Strada, but I can't see myself choosing this over other games when looking for something this light.

I appreciate what this game is trying to do, a quick, light family game with some clever cardplay and timing.  There's nothing that new or exciting that makes me want to play it a lot, just hold on to it until the kids get a little bit older.  But there's a lot of those types of games now, and I'm not sure this one will stand out enough to make the cut.

Probably the best thing Toledo has going for it is the theme.  I don't really care about the swords, but I really enjoyed visiting the town, and the El Greco artwork is a nice touch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An overly simplified game about making swords. This really smacks of vanilla TTR. Players choose to either draw 2 cards or play a combination of cards to complete their swords. Thats it. 

There is some luck of the draw, but this game doesn't really have the tension that TTR has. Instead it has a weird in-game dueling system which doesn't really work and feels very tacked on. However, the game does move very quickly and is quite easy to pick up.

I'm a little disappointed with the lack of depth, but it makes a good filler and the components are pretty enough.

The name of Martin Wallace just seems to be a sign of quality. Even as he had made a game that's clearly aimed at family audiences more than his usual offerings, the game is meaty enough for hc-gamers. Signs of Caylus are there, but other than that the game felt really original to me. The start of the game is a bit awkward as I don't see it happening that some store places wouldn't be used right at the start. After that the game starts to flow nicely and the card system shines. El Greco offers an extra scoring mechanism typical of Wallace and there is a way force the game to end faster, but apart from these this one doesn't feel like a typical heavy Wallace-game. There's one minor error in the art design of the game: The caballeros fencing in the "skill" store picture are using their left hands. In such an übercatholic country Spain was back in the day that everything important was taught to be done with your right hand, while using left hand for example to write was considered almost like sin, I don't think these guys wouldn't have been fencing with their left hands.

I am curious about the subtle power of the fencing skills...

Plays faster than it appears, because it looks busier than the game actually is. Decisions are not so difficult, but that does not make it a bad game by any means. It makes it very playable for just about anyone. The struggle probably comes with keeping up with other players with their resources, fencing ability and presented swords. It becomes somewhat of a race with a person bring their 3rd pawn to the castle as a strategic maneuver to end the game when they will be winning.

Toledo is one of those games that has a good idea but just doesn't manage to get along well due to one single mechanism: the movement of the pawns.

First of all, the theme here surprised me greatly, as not only is quite original and unique, but also is plausible even though it's a pure euro. The locations are extremely important and you must keep a lot of things in mind when placing them or you will find yourself completely screwed when moving your pawns, which leads us to the great drawback of this one: the stupidly high luck factor when determining movement. I don't mind of high luck when it's well timed, but in a game like this is a complete failure: the most carefully planned strategy can be completely ruined due to a partially bad draw of movement cards.

So, overall, the game is entertaining, and not only has theme, but also enough interaction to affect your opponent moves and all, but has way too much luck for a game which seems to be designed as to favour strategy over tactics.

Quick family game with a variable gameboard (the first thing you'll most likely do is constructing the road with the different businesses) and a focus on card management (to allow the optimal movement of your workers). Not very inspiring or original.

A nice and simple game, worth buying and have it in your collection, fast and a little bit lucky (duels).
Although there is the factor of luck at duels i still like them and find them the most fun part in this game.
Good game in general.

In my first and only play (!) it felt like a rushed-up game.The combat part is useless and boring; can play the whole game as a tactic-logic game, simply avoiding meeting with anyone else's figures.The graphic components just don't fit each other; it is a not well thought-out mixture of different styles.The whole game is not really fun.

Only played this because it's a Wallace game.  It's not bad but it feels antiquated and obsolete despite coming out in 2008.  The gameplay is abstract and overall unexciting although mechanically sound.  I'm a big Wallace fan but that didn't do it for me.

RATING: 6
Definitely lighter fare for Wallace, it still packs more of a punch than some other light fare out there.  Card distribution seems a bit off after one play, but that may be just me and the one play!  Cards are used to move and pay for items BUT you can only use one number during the course of your turn to move spaces.  A little bit of swordplay/dueling is included in which you can buy skill and give yourself a greater advantage in winning a duel and sending an opponent back home.  Ironically, there could be times where people want to lose a duel to return to home to save a turn!  First part of the game is spent primarily placing four different types of workshops where items and skills are sold (they are free to you if you land on your own, otherwise you will pay a price dictated by the level upon which they are located).

After loving both A Few Acres of Snow and Discworld: Ankh-Morpork, we decided to buy up more Martin Wallace games. When we saw Toledo at the store, we thought, that's one! Yes! Unfortunately, it's pretty simple, and, since we mainly play games for two, there's not a lot of sword-fighting that comes up in our plays. This sits on the shelf, waiting for kids to come along (or maybe a future trade).

Una bella sorpresa: gioco dalle regole semplici, molto giocabile, ma assolutamente non banale; ottimo per chi cerca una partita meno impegnativa, o per giocatori non troppo esperti. Il meccanismo è semplice quanto interessante, essenzialmente basato sul movimento tra le botteghe dove acquistare acciaio o gemme, o creare spade da portare a palazzo; occorre ragionare bene su come sfruttare le proprie carte, sapendo che dalle proprie botteghe possono beneficiare anche gli avversari (dietro pagamento). L'unico punto migliorabile sono i duelli, in particolare per quanto riguarda le tessere abilità che non mi sembrano così utili (in rapporto al costo). Comunque faccio un po' fatica a capire certi voti bassissimi: certo può non piacere a tutti, chi cerca giochi molto complessi guardi altrove; ripeto, secondo me ottimo.

This sits in an unhappy place for me between a random, light filler game and a heavy, interesting game.  The randomness of the cards make it just miserable for me and it plays too long for what it is.  Perhaps my least favorite Martin Wallace game that I have played.

2011: A kind of Caylus for family play, apt for children, simple and straight, it has no surprises, forces you to plan a little your movements. A 6 as it can be fun with the correct people.

This was fun for two plays, an agreeable Euro.  In the third game, one player took all the fighting school tiles.  Just as I had the win in the bag, he attacked all my pieces, delaying me until he could scrape together enough victory points to win on a tie.  This whole agonizing operation took about 20 minutes, roughly half again as long as the rest of the game.  I consider the game broken and will not play it again.

A Martin Wallace Euro about the making of swords, which requires the gathering of various resources. 

The clever element here is that the players can make moves along a winding street path on their way to the King to present their final goods. The rules for movement and what can be gained at each location is extremely important and that allows for the interplay between the players. 

This game really doesn't get the love it deserves and has flown under the radar.

Perfectly mediocre. Shares a lot in common with Tokaido and Great Western Trail (mostly), but isn't nearly as interesting in comparison.

First impression (4 players): A lighter Martin Wallace game. There is very light "economic model" (you get stuff free from your own shops and pay a fixed price if you use other players shops) and some similarities with Caylus (you can place your shops on "the road" here too).

You move your pawns with number cards and the trick is that you can play several cards in turn if they have the same number. For that you'd like to horde some cards to make more effective turns. But there is only limited number of better swords (points) that can be forged and you also must be able to deliver swords into castle so you score full points (instead of half)

So there is some balancing to think about during the game but overall the decisions in are pretty straightforward. Nothing spectacular to see here but an okey lighter game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Only played with two and it's a really average mechanical and tactical game. I expect it to have completely different dynamics with more players, so my rating may get better. Theme provides a bit of colour but doesn't make any sense.

RATING: 7
Much less fiddly and complex than the average Wallace, this is Caylus-lite, if you will, with a bit of Backgammon thrown in. I find it pleasurable stuff, and having nine meeples all dancing down the track means there are plenty of options to be considered. Plus you can wrap up a game in half an hour flat, and that can't be said about many big boxes.

The game has some interesting points, but seems to be missing something and the play is not that much fun. It is worth a try and cannot be judged on just one play, since it can seem like a race at first but then when you figure out how to place your businesses to best take advantage of your cards and how the most expensive swords should not always be chased, the game does improve.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This race game reminds me a little of the mass-market game Sorry!--you're trying to get a bunch of pieces to the end of the track, and if you land on another piece, you can send it back home.  That said, there's a lot more going on here--you need to balance trying to collect cards and resources with actually finishing the race.  Trying to get a bunch of stuff for later may seem wise, but you don't want to have the game end when you have a boatload of unused cards or resources.

Too carefully made game this one.
The ingredients are for a hit game, but because nothing new is introduced, this one won't achieve much. A good family game for four but not more. 

You can really be left behind if you lay too few of your own buildings into the board. One of the players missed this fact in our first game and that was disastrous for him, because sometimes it's just too expensive to move only to your opponents' fields.

There really should be some bonus for a successful defence against another player.

It's hard to give Toledo a fair score after one play. This can be said about a lot of games, but Toledo really requires a full understanding of the mechanics before you can begin to play properly.

In my little experience, the basic design seems fast paced and interesting enough, however I can't help but feel the obvious strategy is just to charge the Alcazar with a bunch of cheap swords. Initial placement of the business tiles accounts for 90% of the game and random card draws can seal the win for a player.

Overall- I enjoy the general mechanics of the game but this feels a little too random. More plays will tell.

A simple game using worker placement and a rondel.  It easy to teach and learn, but can outstay it's welcome just slightly.  That is, it lasts just a tad longer than I'd like - especially if someone is constantly dueling.

Com um tabuleiro bem ilustrado, tiles facilmente perceptíveis, componentes de muita qualidade e mecânicas apreciáveis, este é um mimo de jogo, onde todos os detalhes foram pensados, a começar nos meeples, passando pelas pedras preciosas multicolores e a terminar nas pinturas de El Greco, referência cultural da Toledo de outrora. À táctica da colocação dos tiles e à estratégia da movimentação dos jogadores, Martin Wallace adicionou a lotaria dos duelos, a qual, sendo apenas minimamente controlável, confere um tom de desespero ao jogo, tornando-o muito engraçado, embora tão propício ao amor, como ao ódio!

Nail biting race to craft swords and get them to the castle. This is the most suspenseful race game I have ever played. After we played a few games and got better at our strategies, the games have been really close in scores. A hidden gem of a game. Plays excellent with 2 players.

I didn't think it would that fun to play, rather dull compared the caylus. Well, it isn't like caylus at all, and is rather fun to play. It is not a deep game, and plays more as a family game. It has not been turned down when asked to play it. The gameplay for 4 players has always clocked in the 90 mins range. The same thing near the end happening over and over is what you think might happen before someone ends it, but so far the cards drawn have made the ending unpredictable.

--Aug2010-- It makes an interesting juxtaposition with the recently-played [i]Egizia[/i]:  the Cathedral-to-Alcazar path here was slightly reminiscent of the play-along-the-Nile there.  They're not as close as all that, of course:  but it was amusing to see a linear constraint in action in both places.
On its own merits, this one is a nice family game:  doesn't overstay its welcome; has ample randomness so that the loser can claim he was robbed by bad card draws and the winner can be assured that some of her decisions were relevant in the result.  Easy enough to explain, too.  Thanks for the trade, Tim!

RATING: 5
Simple game in a big box. Looks a bit like Caylus but plays very differently. The game begins by reserving spots for their own actions. You can use your own action for free but have to pay for other player's actions. This creates a different board for every game and offers the possibility for differetn strategies. Then players use cards to move to actions and use them to collect steel and gems and forge swords from out of the materials. The swords need to be taken to palace to score full points for them. First player to get three pawns to the palace ends the game.

Average game from Martin Wallace in which you collect material to produce the best swords in town. On the other hand you can buy famous paintings. Strange mixture in a way. And it was only half fun.
Nothing special about it … all the used mechanics you've seen more or less in other games. The fact that I finally can't remember gameplay leads to my conclusion: I don't have to play it anymore although I'm glad I've made this experience.

A good game about making swords, presenting them to the palace, and using them on other swordsmasters who get in your way. Essentially this is a resource collection game on a track leading to the palace. You play cards to move along the track and land on certain buildings, which tell you what you can do there. Playing cards that match let you move again in the same turn. You have several workers to move along the track. You can build buildings on the track if there are any spaces left, so it's quite likely that this is all players will do on the first few turns. You can also acquire horses (which count against your score but give you more maneuverability) and swordfighting skills (which helps when someone is in your way). You can make standard swords or ornament these swords with jewels for even more points when presented to the palace.

Certainly got to the game table quicker than other Martin Wallace offerings. Easy to teach; picked it up and was playing effectively first time. So far, only played twice as a two-player, which allows each player to place all of his/her businesses if (s)he so desires. A four-player game, at maximized play, would only allow each player to place half of the businesses, so I would guess, a tighter decision process regarding which half one wants to place. On the other hand, more people, looking to optimize their placement could end up creating more opportunities for everybody.

While the rules suggest movement "back to the Cathedral" (start space) as something you'd want to employ judiciously, we found ourselves using it freely; two or three (or more) times per game in each of the two games we played. Since you are only required to deliver three swords to the Emperor, this leaves two pieces on something of a 'free float' mode; capable of being sent back to the beginning to start working with the business placement you designed to earn you steel and gems.

 All that said, a terrific game with enough mental challenge to engage the serious gamer, while offering light game play to those less inclined to serious thinking.

I wonder idly, whether there might be some 'givens' that would lend themselves to something of a 'solution.' For example, it seems pretty clear that since the movement token you can pick up at the Fencing Master business deducts two points from your score if you own it when the game ends, it would seem to be important to a) spend most of the game with the three you're allowed and b)place a Fencing Master business somewhere in the last row, so that you can get a fourth and return the movement token. It also seems pretty clear that you should have a 'sword maker' within a few movements of the "Alcazar' (or castle of the Emperor, where swords are delivered).

Shuffling the cards WELL is important. Because cards of a certain value are often played two or three at a time and when two players do this in repetition, one value can get stuck in a single position in the deck, it's important to get a good shuffle so that the overall card distribution (values 1 through 6, of which there are 16 each, if memory serves) is spread out. Nothing worse in this game than having eight 6's in your hand, or 2's, for that matter.

The game has earned its "8" as far as I'm concerned; something I'll always agree to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The game seems promising. Our first play ended rather quickly since we weren't able to stop a player from sending is third piece to alcazar. He won with only two swords completed which seemed a bit lame... 

We didn' t see it coming at all as we were all concentrating on forging swords. 

Will have to play again soon to get a better feel for the game.

Caylus meets snakes and ladders is not a bad description. Interesting game play, however rather unforgiving if you set up badly. For a light medium Euro it is not a gentle affair with no real catch up mechanism and it quite possible to get completely zugzwanged by poor early choices. Nevertheless  intriguing and I need to play it more than once. I suspect it's a little fragile but need to explore further. Does Marin Wallace do easy listening?

2p game not hugely satisfying as giving a card feels critical only opponent. Must try 3 player.

This is a vastly underrated game, and like some other Wallace games, like Tyros, its overall score suffers from people not playing it correctly.  

If you look at the low rating comments, with people thinking that getting the 15 point sword to the castle will somehow "win" the game, I wonder if they're not playing that 3 pawns at the castle ends the game.  That would make it a ridiculous race game, but it doesn't work that way.  Three pieces of a single color must be in the castle for the game to end, so chances are that there will be 7 to 9 pieces, and possibly 7 to 9 swords delivered in a 4 player game.  And remember those undelivered swords still count at half-value.  

Our games have been very close, and the player with the 15 point sword wins no more often that the players who dont have it.  And I've also seen players win this by being able to drop their -2 horse on their last turn and take the win (in that case they literally left a pawn and kept a card, positioned to drop the horse, during the last several turns, and let another player end it, thinking they were 1 point a ahead!).

The horse tile is very powerful, yet it is only -2 points--that should be a clue that tne end-game points are going to be tightly packed, and they almost always are.  Always between 1st and 2nd, and often all for players will be within a point or two of each other.

Nope, this game is tight, brilliant with its business layout mechanic, balanced in its sword values, art-card values (also a viable winning technique), and has many paths to victory.  It is well worth adding to your collection!

While there is a lot of ketchup spreading with collecting metal and jewels to make swords, the real meat of the game is the race to finish first.

My second favorite game from Gathering 2008 (behind Dominion). A nice, very light worker-selection *meets* racing game. Others have said that there aren't alot of choices and that the game ends too quickly. Odd, since I thought the amount of choices were perfectly adequate for the weight, and that it might have taken a little too long.The one game I couldn't stop comparing it to in my mind was Marco Polo Expedition (which was my favorite Gathering game for 2004). Similar feel and weight, though the gameplay is markedly different. If you loved/hated that one, you might have similar attitudes toward Toledo.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed this simple and relatively fast-paced game.  This is squarely in the "family game" camp.  There's quite a bit of luck, mostly due to the card-heavy nature of the play, but like Ticket to Ride, there's still plenty of room for strategy as well.  I'd happily play this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A quick, lighter Wallace game that rewards efficiency of cardplay.
 
The central action is to move your pawns using numbered cards, using the businesses where you stop or pause. Each turn you can use only one card value, but move as often as you want. The businesses let you gain a card, gain a painting (VP), gain fencing or movement skills, acquire steel or jewels or forge steel and jewels into swords (VP). Each business can accommodate only 1 or 2 customers, so sometimes you duel a resident to take their place, and sometimes its best to just move on and avoid the risk, since losing a duel sends you back to the start. Swords score most VP if they are delivered by a pawn to the castle at the end of the road. First player to get 3 pawns to the castle ends the game, but most VPs wins it.

Can be played in a "get ahead, then end it quick" fashion, but since other players get one more turn its possible they'll rein in your lead.

I might possibly be rating this too highly.  It's not a bad game, but it's not a great one either.  The theme is fun, though a friend of mine suggested an alternate theme.

After one game, I really don't know how to rate this... The idea is to use 5 apprentices to collect resources (steel & gems), have them forged to swords, and present the work to the King of Spain. In the first phase of the game, you're basically "making your bed" for the rest of the game - this means that unless you have read the rules & thought about the game very carefully, you likely will not do well, or even get the whole idea in the first game. It does seem to have some potential, but at the moment it looks like anything between 6 and 8.

Toledo is a children's game.  From that perspective, it's quite good:  bright gems, swords that you "build", and a Chutes and Ladders mechanic that sends a member of your team back to the start.  But for gamers, it's a random stinker.  The last 1/4 of the game is simply timing the end so that one can win by a single gem or card.  This was not marketed well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I don't know about most people, but I love it when a game allows me to interact with other players rather than just with the game. Toledo takes full advantage of that thrill. This game is a lot of fun, there are many strategies for victory and the game is never the same twice because it hinges entirely on other people's decisions. While it makes the game a thrill to play, it takes control away from the individual and makes victory difficult sometimes. You can work your tail off, but there's always someone waiting to take the lead. This game is much more enjoyable if you don't take winning too seriously.

Also, the "art" element feels out of place and unnecessary. I think it was tacked on as an after thought.

A light, half card management, half racing eurogame.

I enjoyed the mechanisms, from the "buildable" path to the coin/movement system. The game has two brilliantly conflicting mechanics, one pushing you to wait, gather sets and have efficient turns, the other pushing you to rush, either to get to open spots first, or to get the swords both first and in time to the castle. Overall the game offers quick yet tough choices full with player interaction.

On the other side, the theme is akwardly pasted on, and although the components are pretty enough, the result is an abstracted game that is not very inspiring. In addition, since there are duels in the game, I can't really reccommend this as a family game, and the category "light gamers games" is a bit restricting and narrow.

Despite its shortcomings, I enjoy playing the game, but it fails miserably to excite me.

Toledo is not Martin Wallace at his best. I suppose Wallace has too much to live up to after classics like Age of Steam and Liberte, and under-appreciated gems like Byzantium. But Toledo just didn’t measure up. It’s far lighter than any other Wallace game I’ve played, so feels a bit incongruous. I won on my first play without really knowing what I was doing, except that I wanted to get as many of my buildings out so I placed them for my first few turns while others skipped ahead to collecting resources. Then I focused on getting the highest value swords due to the increasing marginal returns for obtaining the most valuable swords. Then I raced to end the game as quickly as possible once I had grabbed the lead. I didn’t feel like there was anything else I could’ve logically done, and unlike something like La Citta or even Hollywood Blockbuster, I’m not forced to agonize over my decisions or left contemplating my decisions after the fact. It doesn’t provide what I’m looking for, but is probably aimed at a different audience.

In Toledo players try to forge magnificent swords and bring them into the fortress of the city, the “Alcazar”.
Each player can send his five helpers on the map and on to the roads of Toledo, in order to acquire steel and jewels from dealers. Thus they get swords manufactured at the most famous armorer in the city. Afterwards those swords are to be delivered to Alcazar.
In addition there are two taverns (at which one “refuels” cards) as well as a place where the works of art of the resident painter, El Greco, are available.

There is too much luck in this game to make it strategic. On the other hand, it just isn't fun enough (and takes too much time) to make it a good filler. There is a lot of counting and collecting numbered cards for a good move. What I dislike the most about this game, is that once the good swords are gone (there is only one 15-point sword for example), it is very hard for the players who did not get any of the best two swords to catch up. After that, the game might end quickly, but it does not have to (if people keep duelling with the leader and he has to return his paws to the start of the track). On the upside: The board looks quite nice, rules are quick to explain and downtime is minimal. Otherwise, quite an unremarkable game.

Wallace has mostly made better games than this. Still the game is solid but its' greatest sin is that I have too many better games.

For a game about making swords and duelling this one is pretty dry. It isn't bad by any means, but the theme doesn't carry this one very much. Toledo combines some very intuitive mechanics and puts players into a race to make the best swords possible and deliver them to win the game.

Haven't played this one in awhile - for a Martin Wallace game this one is pretty light and probably lasts too long for what it is.

Rated after two games, seems to work actually quite good with two players. I was a little bit sceptic after the first game (with 3 players), but the second game with two players was much better. The game is quite quick to play, just a little bit over an hour including the rules etc. I need to play more this to get a better vision.

A light game from Martin Wallace, one of my preferred designers. I like it: it is dynamic, and there is strategy there. 

Un juego ligero de Martin Wallace. Quien lo iba a decir. Solo he jugao una partida, pero apunta maneras. De verdad.

Baja de 8.4 a 7.4 porque creo que la mecanica de los duelos no es adecuada para tener opciones en el juego.

Περιπλανηθείτε στους δρόμους του Τολέδο, κατασκευάζοντας και παραδίδοντας περίτεχνα σπαθιά στο βασιλιά. Προσοχή όμως - το Τολέδο ανήκει και στους αντιπάλους σας. Θα χρειαστεί να τους πληρώσετε, ακόμη και να μονομαχήσετε μαζί τους για να επικρατήσετε!

Another solid 7 Euro that came out of the Nurnberg 08 crop.  Quick and simple with nice production value.

Nice game, nice pieces. Plays fine with two, but better with more. Quite a lite game- collect and race.

Not good. Too simple, too straightforward, too bland.
Is this what happens every single time Mayfair publishes an original Wallace design? (Think La Strada...)
Methinks those game editors tinker with the designs too much. Otherwise, how come every game to come out of Treefrog (and sometimes republished by Mayfair) rocks?

An overlooked gem

Easy to learn, a great mixture of tactics and strategy, an obvious goal and path, a good combination of simple choices each turn with hard choices per game phase.

I loved it

plays very quick. The swordmaster skills look a bit out of place in the game.

How is it possible that the horse tile that allows you to break your chosen movement value doesn't come with a higher penalty?  Movement restriction is the central mechanic of the game, and yet it's easily avoided! A penalty of -5 points (or worse) seems more appropriate.

Also, be sure to get lucky and draw cards that allow you to land on spaces that get you more cards.  This strategy is best accompanied with horse tile abuse, of course.

Title-bashing: Toledo? Just terrible - at least for people who live near the American midwest.

Finally, only play with four players.  Not much point otherwise.

There are a lot of really neat and innovative mechanics in this game and it's fun enough but for some reason it always falls a little flat for me. 

Aesthetically, the art on the board is lovely and I think the piles of iron and jewels look sweet, but there are some strange design choices. The sword tokens look sterile and plain, and the backs of the cards have a super low resolution texture. 

I've only played this as a two player game. I can imagine that there's a lot more competition and conflict with more players.

Uno de los juegos más fáciles de jugar de tito Wallace. A mí me gusta mucho, pero parece que debo ser el único que le ve algo a esta oca avanzada... Se trata de un ligero juego de colocación de trabajadores, gestión de cartas y de recursos para iniciar a nuevos jugadores, muy bueno tanto a 2 como hasta 4 personas. No entiendo porqué está tan mal valorado.

The artwork looked nice, and the text on the back of the box was interesting to us. Also the name of the designer, was appealing. Played this one, and to be honest, we were a bit disappointed after playing. We expected more of a Martin Wallace game. It’s not a bad game, but we didn’t expect a family game. And that’s precise what it is. A nice family game. Easy to explain. Easy to play and while playing, there is enough room for some nice chit-chat.

Beautiful board, easy to teach.  Nice production value.

Toledo feels like it has a lot of randomness, especially in duels, for a Euro.

RATING: 5.5
There are some interesting mechanisms in there, and it is certainly best with every player having played before, and understanding the value of the positions on the board for which they are jockeying, versus the value in capitalizing on turn opportunity.  I love the way the first edition's board and components integrate, such that it really looks like the gem bits are spilling from the chest, and the ingots are piled up out of the board when you have them in their respective locations.

Usually even in the game which I could not like, it is filled with unique dilemma.
But, in this game, I could not find out any interesting dilemma.
I think this game is the weakest from Mr. Wallace among the games I played so far.

Los jugadores adquieren los metales y gemas necesarios para manufacturar las mejores espadas para luego  presentarlas al emperador en el palacio del Alcázar. Cada turno deberán realizar sus acciones usando cuantas carats quieran pero de un solo valor.

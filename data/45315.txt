If it's possible, this is both derivative and innovative at the same time. The worker placement is nothing new at all (and it's far from one of the best worker placement systems) but the theme is absoultely fabulous and really immerses you in the building of a dungeon - an Ameritrash game with euro mechanics if ever there was one.

RATING: 8.5
Like so many of Vlaada's designs, initial head-scratching gives way to satisfyingly intuitive gameplay once digested. It took the majority of the first game for it to really click for my (fairly experienced) group though. 

The 'bookkeeping' can seem fiddly at first but it soon becomes pretty fluid and automatic. 

I love the feel of this game just as much as Dungeon Petz. The simultaneous action selection is just as good here, but tighter as you have to commit to the specific spots in advance. Decent mix of tactical play and long-term strategy. You definitely have to pay attention to other people's boards and available actions. I think repeated plays will be rewarded with knowledge of the room tiles, traps etc. and generally just getting better at managing both planning and combat; I think we will see people gunning for those 5 point paladins in future! 

On the downside, it really shines at 4p which means I don't get it to the table as much as I'd like. And it's a bit of a pain to teach as you do need to cover pretty much everything in order for any of the decisions to make sense. Still, it's a keeper. A Dungeon Keeper. har har

Not sure why I haven't recorded more of my plays.  This one is a bit fiddly, but very solid.  I never fail to get edged out of an action I want by being in a bad position or trying to be greedy and playing the card late.  I like the combat puzzle aspect.

Would have enjoyed it if it was a bit shorter but it didn't help we had a chronically distracted opponent.

This is a pretty fun game, though "taxes" should really be called "maintenance" (Evil Overlord paying taxes?). There are some weird oddities theme-wise and a bit too "spreadsheet-esque" for being a dungeon lord IMO, but overall very well done. Seems to be 4 players only, though. :(

So there's the placing of the workers and the collecting of the goods. Fine, fine. Then we all stop and play a private game by ourselves where it actually encourages you to stop, backtrack, and start again if things don't work out well. This our hobby does not need.

I did not enjoy my first play of Dungeon Lords. There's a bit of a gimmick with worker placement - but it doesn't work terribly well for me. You simultaneously select and the positions of most value are not all the same - e.g. first placement is not always best. It doesn't lead to a tough decision because it's controlled (for the most part) by chaos. The best portion of play was combat - which seems to be governed mainly by monster selection. And as has been said before, you pretty much just play the game twice in a row. Finally, there's no way this game plays in 90 minutes. Ours ran more like 4 hours. Over all, a fair game, but not great.

Dungeon Keeper, el juego PC ahora en tu mesa! XD Interesante mecanica de selección de acciones, de gestión, y segunda parte del juego de "lucha/puzzle" entre los aventureros y tus trampas y monstruos. Esta entretenido,  y divertido si le metes el tema que llevan las instrucciones. Tienes pocos turnos para gestionarte, y como crítica, tomas pocas decisiones para lo que dura el juego. Por ello tienes que planificar bien tus recursos y la lucha al final de cada uno los 2 años que dura el juego. Optimizado para 4, se puede jugar a 3 o 2 con las reglas oficiales, colocando únicamente en cada turno los esbirros de los otros jugadores virtuales, cosa que a 2 jugadores, cada uno maneja a otro más, sólo las ordenes, y resulta interesante. A 3 no lo he probado.

Vlaada knows how to make fun games, that's for sure. Again, here's a game which is insanely fun to play even if you're not doing that well. But what's even better, this game isn't just fun, but it is well designed also. The mechanics work great, the game looks good and the components are of good quality. Oo-yeah!
Has potential for a rating of 9, but only time will tell...

Another Vlaada gem. It's a pure euro that also has a great theme, superb components, very nice mechanics and a thoroughly enjoyable experience for me. It's pretty complex and many things can be taken into consideration each turn, but because of the high amount of decisions, the final fight at the end of the round is pretty interesting, as many things don't work the way we'd like them to :) Still, although the learning curve it not that lean (especially for the combat rounds) once learned things work pretty fast. It's a medium-to-complex euro game that brings an original theme and some very cool ideas. Highly recommended.

A good game that just doesn't provide enough consequences to your actions. It doesn't really matter that all your rooms get smashed as long as you defeat all the raiders and can't pay all your debts.

Good, fun game with some neat mechanics (adventurers, monsters) but 90% of the game is admin and it would be a lot more fun if it was more streamlined. Just look at the size of the dungeons at the end of the game - it doesnt feel like you get to build much at all.

Not my favorite Vlaada Chvátil game. You play a aspiring dungeon lord who is part of this sort of fantasy corporation. You get promoted based on how well you do at constructing a dungeon that thwarts adventurers. While the premise is neat the execution isn't fantastic. The game has a lot of upkeep regarding resolutions and often feels more like a lot of set up and then some combat happens and then a new round begins. There also isn't a big variety of monsters or heroes so the game can feel played out and repetitious after a while. That being said it is a beautiful game and it does have some interesting stuff going on. It is just out competed by new additions to my game collection so I don't bring it to the table anymore.

Randomness is a bit overbearing, feels like you have a lot of control but not really, monsters, traps, rooms, adventurers are all random and in the wrong combination can be impossible for you to get what you need. A poor end of year and you have lost the game, make sure you can kill all of the adventurers.

The card choice is very dependant on other players and is a great second guessing opportunity but you need to play the random board at the same time. Turn order can also be very influencial.

I think this really is a good game.  A great design, brilliant art, great production values...a phenomenal package!  Unfortunately, it took me several tries and a few days to digest the rules in order to teach it.  Teaching it took a good long time too.

I feel heartbroken, but I'll probably get rid of this game.  After a month, I'll have forgotten enough of the rules that it would take too much time to relearn and reteach...when in truth, it may be a year before I play it again.  By then, it will be hopeless.

The only game I own that I feel is really worth that investment is [b]Space Alert[/b].

Uno de los juegos cuya temática y mecánicas están mejor unidas. No es sino una versión de juego de mesa del gran juego de pc Dungeon Keeper, y además es muy fiel.

Además el tono en el que está hecho es muy divertido y se presta al buenrollismo.

So.  Awesome.  Build up your dungeon for when the adventurers arrive.  Watch your eviltude on the evilometer lest the Paladin seek you out.  This one just oozes theme.

Lots of fun.  I like the action selection mechanic.  Limited actions leading up to "scoring rounds" (combat rounds) lend tension to the design.  The bits and artwork are magnificent!  Game length is just right to a little long.  I like how there's a concentrated delay (choosing actions, everyone at once) followed by quick resolution.  Game flows fairly well.

Loses points for fiddliness and lack of a catch up mechanism.  Very difficult to come back and not too hard to fall behind.  Also, teaching this is a pain.  There's a lot to cover and it tends to take awhile.

Still, I love this game!  Strongly recommended that you give it a try and see if it's for you.

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Very cool idea and interesting mechanics. This is the first worker placement game that I tried and it immidiately made me want to find a game of this category good for my taste, because, even if I loved this mechanic right away, I didn't love Dungeon Lords as much. I see in this game a lot of good elements: I like worker placement, I like the deduction element and I like the fact that I can "build" something.

Yet the mix doesn't work so well for me. The building part is actually very small and a little too random (I'm talking about the Rooms). The number of decision is also very low, which for someone can be an interesting challenging element, but I don't like it. The scoring also is wierd: I like the idea of the titles, but I don't understand what's the point of counting the number of caught adventurers, which is the same for everyone (if you don't count the big guy). In the end the graphic looks also a little too messy and wierd and makes me dislike the visual impact of the game.

The entire game gives me a strange feeling of good mechanics, that are not so well put together. It gives me some fun and I might play it every now and then, but probably it doesn't match my taste enough to make me enjoy it more.

Only played this one twice, but I'm very impressed with it; the systems interact very smoothly, and there are clearly a lot of strategic nuances to learn.  The only thing I'm wondering about at present is whether seating order matters a bit too much a la Puerto Rico.

Update: There's a lot of satisfying planning and decision making here; it also plays surprisingly well for two.  It's a good game if you focus on the scoring system; although novices instead spend all their time trying to beat off the good guys, that's a good game too.

RATING: 7
Preliminary rating. Vlaada Chvátil is unquestionably brilliant, and Dungeon Lords hosts stunning artwork, charming and high quality components, and hilarious theming. But is it fun? Procedural plus chaos doesn't seem to be my thing: the chaos of worker placement uncertainty would be OK in a less lengthy, less involved game, but here feels unsatisfying, if not outright irritating because of the enormous and lingering impact. Highly intricate with lots of small fiddly rules that I suspect would become second nature after more plays, but I'm not sure more plays are in the offing for me. Like Space Alert, this is another Vlaada game I'm probably destined to admire more than enjoy...

Extra point for the Evilometer. Love that!

After an hour+ of practice boards and rules explanation this game was sure to fail.  The group never wanted it back on the table after initial go.  The main complaint beyond the rulebook/practice scenarios being a pain was the absence of any direct player interaction.  There might be a good game in here, but we weren't willing to trudge our way through another play(or 3) to find it.

Bought this on artwork, theme and BGG rating.  Didn't play as I expected but my respect and enjoyment is increasing with each play.

Despite the different themes, I'd describe it as very similar to Agricola.  It's all about worker placement.  Dungeon building and fighting off heroes is a secondary concern.

Only played 4 times, so this could easily change to an 8 or 10 in future.  Too bad it doesn't go to 5 players, I'll be playing the 3 player game mostly.

Loving it as a 3-4 player game but find the 2 player too brutal.  Don't think I'll be playing "divorce mode" very often.

RATING: 7.5
Played it years ago, and recall having the initial reaction that it was a good game, but the replay ability would be poor since you see all the monsters etc every game.  I've read that was an intentional design decision for a tighter balance, but still one I think makes the game less fun than it could be.

I recently saw the expansion on a substantial discount and decided to get it and the base game for myself, so I'm hoping the expansion will add some replay ability to it, but even so, its a good game to play a couple times a year.

Probably never gonna happen, but would love to see the theme redone to just focus on the dungeon building/management aspect of the game since that's where the draw is for me.

This takes a bit of work to get to the table for new players.  The "Training" can be a bit offsetting and can extend the play time beyond what some are willing to handle.  Once the training is complete, the game itself is quite enjoyable and subsequent plays are much shorter.

Finally got this on the table.  Glad we had someone to teach us the game.  Though it's fairly intuitive and the game aids are excellent, there's a ton of stuff to keep track of.

Seems fiddlier than it needs to be, but that might just be because I'm bitter .....

The warnings that this is a "Gamer's Game" are indeed true.  Be prepared for a LOT of boards and a LOT of bits.  Difficulty fitting this one on the table.  Manage to power through the rules though, and you have an excellent strategy game with a perfectly implemented theme with a unique twist on the Worker Placement Mechanic that is starting to become overused...  Gotta love the little golden imps too!  =D

A lot of mechanics and rules melded into this game.  Basically you simultaneously draft various actions in order to build up a dungeon which will (hopefully) be capable of holding off the various adventurers seeking plunder and glory from you.  A game for gamers in that there is a bit of rules teaching that needs to be done beforehand, taking some time to get to actually playing.  If anything the game is very strategic, offering a lot of different options to players.  However while there is a lot to do in this game, it ultimately devolves into a long and drawn-out endeavor.  I can appreciate the mechanics, but players are asked to think too much and are rewarded with too little.  I don't completely hate the game however, it's just that there are a lot of other games out there which do similar things to this and are a lot more enjoyable and play faster.

As an asides note I just wanted to give thanks to Z-Man games for sending me in some of the components missing in my game!

RATING: 10
Great game where you have to manage your resources and guess what your opponents will do. There are so many trades and balances that everyone stays close to the lead. Even when losing it is still fun to play and build up the dungeon. 

It is complicated to teach and there are two phases of the game that need to be learned (building dungeon, and defending dungeon). However the teaching can probably be streamlined with practice.

Has quickly become one of my favorite games. Some people would argue it has a pasted on scoring mechanism with the "Titles", but I find that it really does reward the best player.  You have to think long term from turn one how you will position yourself for the titles.

RATING: 4.5
Jugada otra partida a 2 jugadores que no está registrada.

Primero las cosas buenas.

- Grandísimo arte gráfico con muchos guiños y gran sentido del humor.

- Los componentes son muy bonitos y con muchos detalles, aunque eso si, solo de calidad media (tableros y cartas principalmente).

Ahora el resto

- La idea de juego es brillante, pero su puesta en práctica me ha defraudado bastante. Las reglas son demasiado farragosas para lo que luego es el juego en sí. Nada intuitivas y diría que hasta rebuscadas y difíciles de recordar (demasiadas excepciones para que el juego resulte fluído). Explicarlas a otro puede ser un suplicio para ambos.

- El juego es caótico, con apuestas ocultas que no sabes como van a resultar y por tanto resulta imposible hacer una planificación de una estrategia a corto plazo. A largo plazo ni hablamos.

- Hay 0 interacción entre jugadores. Cada uno a su mazmorra y poco más. 

- A dos jugadores es un fiasco. El parche del jugador dummy no funciona y hace el juego menos fluído todavía. Sospecho que solo fue pensado para 4 jugadores y para menos se ideó un apaño.

- El desarrollo del juego resulta bastante soso, con pocas acciones interesantes que explorar.


En definitiva, una gran idea, un muy buen grafismo pero un juego que se queda entre dos aguas.

Ignoro si con las múltiples expansiones mejorará algo. Sospecho que lo único que se conseguirá con ellas es embrollarlo más aún.

I really like the puzzle aspect of this game, as well as the theme. Doesn't really feel like a table version of 'Dungeon Keeper' though, which was where my expectations were.

- Tries to mix Galaxy Trucker's chaotic feel with a "serious" eurogame, and it falls flat on both. Too long and complex for the crazy luck fest that GT is, too chaotic to be a serious game (and it wouldn't be remotely original). The tricks for less than 4 players are pretty ridiculous.

Would like to see this rating go up, but I don't know. I really enjoy the artwork, the theme, and the puzzle aspect of the game. I dislike that it took so long to explain and play the first game. I have a strong aversion to dummy players and this game requires them unless it has its full four player compliment. If this game can play in 90 minutes or less, then I will likely raise my rating.

Not quite as clever as its sibling Dungeon Petz, but also a bit heavier. You've got your Building phases and Combat phases, the former sort of a worker placement game where you're making adjustments to your dungeon, and the latter you actually fight the adventurers (and hopefully not Paladins) you have attracted. Sort of like Boss Monster except far, far more elaborate and better. The rulebook is amazing and funny, giving a clear description of every mechanic here. Loads of strategy, this game can get tough when the pressure is on and the adventurers arrive to conquer all that you've created. Good, advanced design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Preliminary rating after one play.  Not the instant classic that Galaxy Trucker is, but more of a brain burner.  The first time you play it, just be glad to end up with positive points.  Nice theme and bits, and of course the obligatory clever instruction book.  

I tend to play this game too aggressively and suffer for it.  You shouldn't wait until you absolutely have to have something because you can pay heavily if you get edged out.  I do think that it suffers when you are only playing with 2 or 3 players.

First impression after a 3-player game: 
Fun game, with great graphical design and funnily written rules. I don't think it's as random as it might appear, as opponent choices are often obvious; landing in the desired place, however, can be complicated, which should be planned for. The evil rating also doesn't seem that easy to control (plenty of ways to go down, not many of going up). 

More familiarity should speed things up and I want to play again with 4 as it should make role selection more interesting.

Have only tried it on 4, been a successful game for my group. It is far from as fiddly as Through the ages and far from as heavy. One thing I don't like is that the gameplay is really not straight forward. Luck is also a notable factor in this game, not extreme but it is there. It is not easy to plan out your strategy, you have to think and react quite a lot. One player's bad decisions may also affect badly on other players. The theme and components are however top notch. Expect the game to last up to 4 hours the first time going through all the rules and tutorials.

This game takes the worst aspects of worker placement and role selection and leaves you with a feeling that you can't even control your own dungeon.  Preparing for the adventurers is an exercise in arithmetic, but a surprisingly enjoyable one.  It pays big to be evil, but the evillest of all dies in agony.

I need to play it again to be sure, but I think this game is not for me without serious revisions to the role selection process.  I want to love this game.

RATING: 2.7
Rating based on playing twice. The game doesn't really convince (kinda fiddly; not enough meat). Overall board setup and housekeeping phases take too long. The worker-placement aspects work great (love double-guessing what everyone else will play), but with only two resolution phases in a game which takes as long as this (so playing multiple times after each other isn't really appealing for most players), you're hardly ever seeing the ultimate effect of your choices, and it's going to take forever to learn to play effectively. 
The game also constantly gives you the feeling you're doing really badly and not making progress, and mistakes are extremely costly. It's weird to have so little fun playing a game which still will have quite a few moments of everyone laughing out loudly. Could be a really good game for a group of diehards who'll really dig in, but definitely not good for something approaching casual play.

Rating might still go up if we play this more often, but the impression so far isn't really going to invite playing more often... :/

After not having felt any desire to give this another try for ~2.5 years, I traded it away for Tikal in the Essen 2012 math trade.

There's a decent game lying underneath all the chrome here. Unfortunately, there's just too many intermediate steps to doing anything. The theme is amazing (I loved Dungeon Keeper back in the day), and Vlaada is a great designer (perhaps my favorite designer), but the game just seems to take too long to do anything, and that sucks all the fun out of it.

It's a decent game, granted. I might play if asked. But it's never going to be amongst all the other great Vlaada efforts for me.

Enjoyed much more than I expected.  My opponents knew the pc game Dungeon Keeper, and attested to the similarities.  But I think as a stand alone design it has much to be admired.  The card drafting technique is simple and inspired, as is the 'worker' placement.  The non random combat build up and mechanism is the cleverest I can think of.  It is clear that a huge amount of development work has gone into the design.  The rules are well drafted and written with humour.  The presentation and graphics are first rate.  My second favourite design of Vladimír Chvátil (after TTA), who never fails to impress.  At the moment (Dec-09) I can't think of an outfit that can beat the CGE team.  My only minor complaint is that I find it difficult to believe we will ever get the game down to its published 90 minute playing time, but even at double that the journey is fun.  My rating is not higher simply because I am not sure how often I want to play this style and size of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Some games click and some games don't.  Sometimes a bad game clicks right away (it's just bad) and sometimes a great game takes a while before you get it.

Dungeon Lords does not click.  We found that no one played with any intention in the first game.  We just did stuff to see how it works.  

My game group happens to be impatient and it will be hard to convince them to sit down with this to figure it out.  It might be great but it will be difficult to get another chance to find out for sure.

One more thing.  I hate game boards that put all the interesting art work in the spots that will be covered by your pieces.  What a waste!  This game is a perfect example of that.

-------------------
-------------------

A few more plays in and it's starting to click (tho I may have ventured into the expanded game a little too quickly).  This has all the hallmarks of Vlaada's best work.  The puzzle solving, the humor, the madness!  Still a lot here to explore though.  In fact I think it's actually harder to grok than his epic: Mage Knight the Board Game.  

Will be digging in further to see if it holds up to more and more plays.

Great theme, great artwork. Chvatil never disappoints. I've only played this twice but it was fantastic. A complex game that feels very deep, but then when it's over you're surprised that it didn't actually take very long at all. The simultaneous planning does wonders for ensuring that downtime isn't an issue and makes for great head games. It makes the game feel very interactive as you are very much focused on what you're opponents are doing and trying to outwit them. No multiplayer solitaire here, even though player interaction is very indirect. 

Rating might go significantly higher after a few more plays.

Egy újabb különleges Chvátil-játék, amit kipróbálhattam. A kártyák lehelyezése nagyon jól ki van találva (nagyon halványan a Shogunra emlékeztet), ez a része nagyon tetszik. A csata már kevésbé. Vagy mi voltunk bénák, vagy a játék túl erős "ellenfél", de második körig el se jutottunk:) Játszanék még vele mindenképp! Nyelvfüggő...

Az újabb partit már 4-ből 3-an túléltük, de így is nehéznek tűnik:) Amit még kiemelnék: nagyon jó a grafika, a táblákon nincs egy betűnyi szöveg sem, csak a kártyákhoz kell nyelvtudás.

4-dik alkalommal úgy tűnik sikerült végre a jó szabályok szerint játazani, így más volt! Nem tűnt reménytelennek, mindenki simán túlélte (nem is nagyon lehet elveszíteni idő előtt, szóval valahogy nagyon rossz szabályokkal játszottuk korábban!). Ami furcsa volt, hogy szorosnak éreztük mindannyian, ehhez képest a végén megdöbbentően nagy különbségek lettek: ketten minuszba kerültünk, ketten pedig plusz 20 körül végeztek, ki érti ezt:) A másik, hogy elég hosszú a játék, szabállyal mindennel volt vagy 3 és fél óra 4 fővel!

Setup can take a while, and it is difficult to explain to new players because there are so many options, but once everyone is on track, this game works very well.  It helps to have everyone on about the same experience level, though, so that you can adjust your strategy toward the titles that other players are taking.

The downside to this game is that it only really plays with 4.  I need a few more options.  Dropping it below Lords of Waterdeep, which is my new interest in worker placement games.

Feb-6-2010 - First Play
I was excited to play this game as I have been reading about great reception it got from the BGG community and I was not disappointed.  The theme is hilarious and unique and the game play is a lot of fun.  There is a lot of jokes to be made while playing the game.  The game should be taken lightly since there is a lot of chaos in the game.  The better you guess where people are going the better stuff you receive.  So if you guess right, great windfall.  If you don't, you are set back.  Also, there are a lot of moving parts in the game that I see is needed but certainly bogs down the game a lot.  The game's theme might be conducive as a gateway game but it has so many little rules that are needed that it is not a gateway game at all.  It is very apparent that the game was designed only as a 4 player game and the rest of number player games are "patched" up to work.  The game takes a long time to play but I was pretty absorbed so I didn't notice.  It wasn't until we were done playing that I realized that it took 4 hours to teach and play a game.  Hopefully, this will go so much faster as we now know the rules.  Overall, it is a fun game of puzzles and hilarity.  I'd definitely play again.

RATING: 7
Wonderful looking game.  However, Vlaada should have included 4 additional bits (tokens, figures, meeples) to indicate which room or tunnel the adventure party is currently conquering.  Using a Minion meeple is stupid, especially if you decide not to engage the party with a monster or ghost in that spot.  I bet players will probably pimp Dungeon Lords with an adventure party token in the same way that players pimp Agricola.

As for gameplay, I enjoyed the simultaneous card playing, but it does make the game pretty random.  It sucks when better monsters or rooms come out the turn in which you are prohibited from playing a moster or room card.  It also sucks when your traps would work better against the heroes that your opponents luck into.  One thing to point out is that I never play with Special events!  Way too random.  

Since there really are only a handful of Heroes, Monsters, & Rooms, I do wonder how much replay value is included in the box.  Dungeon Lords is already begging for an expansion.  

[b]Festival Season[/b]
I was worried that the unique opportunities would be super random, but players know in advance the next upcoming opportunity, so you can mostly plan things.  Overall I enjoyed the expansion.  It adds length.  It's also something that I'd only play with my regular gaming group for Dungeon Lords is already a pain to teach.

After two games I came to the conclusion that this is not Vlaada's best game - Galaxy Trucker is a lot better.
Planning is not possible with this game because everything depends on the decisions of other players, which also base their decisions on all other players decisions etc. ad infinitum.
It's very easy to get screwed early on by poor bad luck, and then there is no good strategy to come back again (if you are low on some resources your possibilities for different actions are also cut to half).
Takes too long for a game with such a high luck factor.

On the plus side the art and the rules are funny.

Terrific Game!!.
What a blast to play, so clever and, once learned, you realise just how smooth it plays .
Yes it's pretty complex, but EVERY single rule is clearly written in the superb rule book, never had to look up one single rule online ( that's unusual) .
A joy to play at 4 players, plays great at 2 but with the added book keeping of the dummy players.

Love the theme, artwork is stunning, component quality is perfection, play is fun and engaging.

Great, great game.

Played full game at all player counts now, not a lot of difference between 3 or 4 player experience, 2 player is still a superb game but you do have the added book keeping.
Love this game, it's one of those games that you keep thinking..next time I will do better!!. :-)

There is a lot going on in this one. Too much, perhaps. This was the rage at BGG.CON. I found that it was quite a bit more complicated than other games I leaned at the con. It has a high learning curve and you voice may go out while teaching this game, because there are a lot of rules to explain. I'll be curious to see if this one has staying power.

There is a lot to like about Dungeon Lords. Yes, it's fiddly. Yes, it's tough to explain to new players. But boy oh boy, when you get 4 people (only really works well with 4, IMO) who know the game, it is SO much fun. You have to really micromanage alot of things to do well (your evil level, your food, your gold, your imps, your monsters). and then the puzzle aspect of killing the adventurers is like a whole other game. I have become a definite Vlaada fanboy with this and Galaxy Trucker. Next Vlaada game for me, Space Alert.

A worker placement game where you never have enough time to do everything you need to do. First you build a dungeon and then in a minigame you fight heroes in your dungeon. I would very much like to get to play more, but not really interested in buying this myself.

I like the mechanics, I like the theme, and I think I've gotten hold of most minor rules. I also love the "disaster management" part :)

At this point, the game is a bit like a puzzle. I need my opponents to gain more experience so that the games becomes more intense: Right now I can do just about anything I want by optimizing my moves, but I think as we play this more, my opponents will get better and I'll have a harder (and funnier) time.

Great 4 player game. Could be played with 2 or 3, but the use of dummy players is not my cup of tea.

Revised upwards as I've played it more. Definitely takes a few plays before strategies really start emerging. Playing with 2 or 3 is not nearly as strong as 4. While it has a very good rule book, its quite unlike other worker placement games and really takes a whole play through to teach people how to play. Fantastic for a more dedicated group and very amenable to repeated plays. Not as good for casual or very traditional players. Wish I could play it more often!

This game not only is about monsters, it is a monster itself! There are so many possibillities that it's almost impossible to grasp everything in a first play. Then you will have just scratched the surface of the wonderous world of Dungeon Lords. The intricacies of the game, the realization of how all the elements work together will slowly grow on you, after a lot of plays.

The game is deep, very deep. Every decision has it's downside, every action has to be maximized to just survive in this game. There is so much stuff you feel you have to do and so little time to do it in. Add to that the simultaneous action selection where you are constantly second guessing the actions your opponents will take to maximize your own and you have another winner by Chvatil. This guy is quickly becoming my favorite game designer. Very high recommendations!

This is a game with high production value and a worthy game to boot. I would recommend that any gamer who appreciates fine production values should give this a try, especially if you enjoy Galaxy Trucker.

That being said, I think this game "euro-izes" the Galaxy Trucker "build-then-destroy" model even more. As in Galaxy Trucker, you are building something first then you see how well it holds up when the bad things happen. In this game the bad things are a group of adventurers who come to your rob and pillage your dungeon.

What's different than Galaxy Trucker, besides the incredibly original theme of course, is that in this game you build through a kind of a card-programming (ala Roborally), worker placement, and resource management approach. That is a lot different than the real-time grab-and-go building in Galaxy Trucker. Additionally, you get to make more interesting decisions in the destroy phase when the adventurers come to loot your dungeon. Though some may disagree, I think this game improves on the already successful and likable Galaxy Trucker quite a bit.

I just find I don't want to play it.  I know, it's a complex game for hardcore gamers, and it has an excellent rulebook.  That being said, I have to set aside 30-45 mins to teach it properly, and then 3 games for everyone to get a good sense of strategy.  And for what?  A game that has a large "outguess-your-opponent" theme with the worker placement?  Seems notoriously out-of-place for a game this complex.

I'll play it, but I'd rather play other worker placement games that don't have such a huge learning curve, yet seem to offer more in the way of strategic thinking.

Bit of a strange one this. I came into the game with high hopes but came away slightly disappointed.

I think the problem is there are two competing games at the heart of this one. There is the nicely-balanced, Euro-style worker placement which is very well done. Then there is the daft, adventurer-bashing, dungeon-overlording game laced with Vlaada's famous sense of humour. 

Whilst they are both lovely games in their own right they do not sit well together. The part of you that responds to optimising your economy and maximising points does not always want the distraction of monsters and traps, whilst the part that loves the monsters and traps and wants to be the evilest evil-dude ever finds the fiddly placement stuff a little boring.

Who would have thought a subsistence farming theme could ever sit better on a game than a dungeon overlord theme?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Like all the other games by this same author, Dungeon Lords is well overrated: in its core it’s nothing more than a mediocre eurogame with an appealing theme stuck on it, which is pretty deceptive, since while playing you never feel it’s the theme that is dictating the rules but quite the opposite, that everything had to be bent to dry and unthematic arithmetics.

In this game you’re never allowed to do what you’d like to do but you only have to be content with the half-satisfying actions you managed to take in a given turn: on top of that, it prevents any form of fight or interaction among players, save for the usual indirect forms that are so commonly found among the most boring eurogames, such as obstructing an opponent or forestalling him on the last slot available, which is the same as throwing a stone and hiding the hand that threw it. (September 2011)

[b]Update[/b] - Almost two years later I still find Dungeon Lords an annoying game: thus in July 2013 I lowered my rating from 5 to 4. Anyhow, it’s appalling to see that it’s still way better than its sequel, Dungeon Pets, which succeeds in being even dryer and more irritating than Dungeon Lords itself.

A heavy worker placement game that tries to mimic the videogame Dungeon Keeper.  The game is long, doesn't feature any player interaction, but maintains a strong sense of theme.  You get a sense that you're a middle manager of your own personal dungeon trying to apply for some bullshit certification.  The heroes attacking is very puzzly and you really need to understand how everything works together to do well.  I don't know enough people that enjoy the game as much as I do.  If each game is a learning game for someone you're never gonna get the full level of enjoyment from this beast.

After one play, this is the game Agricola should have been! The close-out of worker placement is gradual rather than instant, there's no one-upsmanship with the expansion of families, and it's not like there's less information to parse, so you can't even claim that it's simpler and thus not any good. It's also punitive, but not in the same groupthink way that just pisses me off about Agicola. Instead, you're playing both the group hivemind AND the game, which is kind of fun. Would definitely play more.

RATING: 5
How disappointing.  The idea for this game is astoundingly cool, but Vlaada pulls out another overcomplicated mess that barely qualifies as a game.

First off, the worker placement system here is awful.  Blindly assigning workers, but the chances everyone will choose the same space (the only way to be denied) is pretty slim.  Instead you might get an inferior or different version of the action.  Unfortunately, there is very little way to game this system at all.  Also, you can't choose the same actions two rounds in a row which has no thematic reason and appears to exist mostly to make the game harder.

Sadly, that is about all the player interaction involved.  The rest of the game has you defending your dungeon.  A lot of rules are involved here, but they don't make it any more fun.  Yes, there are some decisions to be made here, but they are fairly straightforward and not as puzzlelike as the rules made them out to be.

It cannot be overstated how overcomplicated this is with lots of exceptions.  You get your first order card back, just remember to pay 1 gold if it's one particular card.  Only 1 trap and 1 monster in a tunnel, 2 monsters and a trap in a room, but remember to pay a gold for that trap.  Trolls are like imps except when they are not.  Yeah it's not hard to internalize after a game, but I am not sure it adds anything and the combat section is really a bear to learn for not much payoff.

To sum up my complaints, this is almost a non-game with a weak worker placement system and very little further interaction with other players and very few interesting decisions.  It is also quite chaotic for such a long game with a the results of worker placement unpredictable and the adventurers you end up with only slightly under your purview. Also the game seems quite punitive in all the wrong ways; tax day shouldn't be more dreaded than adventurers.  Again hugely disappointing for such an awesome theme.

Heavy worker placement game with an outguessing-your-opponents element plus "combat" puzzle solving after that. Great theme and thematic integration. There is randomness, but it can be mitigated to a certain extent as one of the possible actions. A little fiddly and complicated at first and little player interaction, so barely not a 10.

Very solid, very funny, very charming and very thematic game (you generally can't go wrong with Vlaada Chvátil).

Only slight drawback is that, especially with newer players, it is a long game which sometimes tends to overstay its welcome a little. Would have been better if it was about one season shorter.

Not that it's a problem by all means, it's still a great game that I'd play anytime.

This game is so freakin awesome i almost can not describe it... I bought it without having played it and was afraid i wouldn't like it.

Wooden cubes, thick card board bits and what about those freakin' imps ?

Worker placement, hand management, role selection, resource management, tile placement,  stitching up opponents, there's a solid combination of Euro mechanics here in a game that borrows heavily from the old Dungeon Keeper PC game. 

Traps, monsters, heroes, paladins, the evilometer, excavating rooms, mining gold, getting food, breeding imps, bonuses from rooms, there's lots of things here, but the game flows pretty easily. This is a really fun game, that I will be looking to play again.

This is a very good worker placement game with a fun theme and the combat works out to be essentially puzzles to solve.  I like all of this stuff, so this is a great game for me.

You really need exactly 4 players that really want to play this game to make it fun, and it will still take quite a while to play.

First game hiccups aside, there's a real quality game inside this one. It'll be interesting to see how strategies evolve as players become more confortable with the mechanics.

One of my current favorites. Great theme and components, funny (if somewhat disorganized) rulebook. Can take a while to teach, though, as understanding how the combat phase works is key to understanding what to pick up during the other 75 percent of the game. Only played as 2-player - in this situation each player has to control a dummy board/player. It feels like a lot of extra work, but on the other hand the added wrinkle here is you get to choose one of the dummy's actions each round, so you get an extra chance to help yourself or hinder the other player. Would be playing more except for the somewhat longish play time (our 2-player games have averaged 2/2.5 hours). Also whereas my wife destroys me at all other worker placement games, I am undefeated here so that's a plus ;)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Wicked theme, wonderful mechanics, great sense of humor... and very challenging.  After playing with four players and two players I'm really, really impressed with this game.  The teo player game still includes all four player boards, with one order nominally in control of each player, with two random orders per round.  This simulates the other two players pretty darn well, and I did not feel that the game came up lacking at all as a two player game.

Dungeon Lords... ahh Dungeon Lords!

The game has a fantastic theme, and it works really well for me. Like Bryan, I was a fan of the Dungeon Keeper PC games (why the heck has this not come out on Steam or for the Playstation Network already?), but I felt that Vlaada did a great job of capturing the wit and feel of those games.

I love the art. The board, the monsters, the implied douchey-ness of the adventurers. The components all look fantastic (and I have yet to print the minion stickers for my copy as yet!).

Now for the difficult part: explaining the love of the game part of the game. I really enjoy the fact that you need to play the game a bit to get good at it. I think that you need to plan further ahead in this game than in many other games. One turn ahead is not enough. The game tells you what is coming up, there is no way that you should be caught unawares during payday or tax season once you have a couple of games under your belt. I think that you should not only be planning ahead for what you need for a given turn (gold/food/evil) but be trying to mess with the plans of your opponents. I can't understate the importance and fun of using the subtle mechanisms of the game to mess with your opponents. It can be as overt as blocking someone from getting a resource when they need it, bumping them up or down a level in the order resolution for a given order (it can be a terrible blow to be bumped up or down in the order resolution queue for many of the orders, as you may not have the resources to get what you needed from the order, despite ending up with the 'better' position in the queue) or manipulating your evilometer to force a 'bad' adventurer onto an opponent. Take a monster that your opponent wanted, and force one with a more punishing upkeep onto them, or even have them not recruit at all! I just love seeing these little chips in the wall come together and form large cracks. I don't think that you actually need to be punching someone in the face for them to feel like that's what happened at the end of the game!  Even better, once you're playing with people for a while, the metagame starts to become a bigger part of the game, and you're outwitting the plans laid to mess with you!!

Once all that has played out, you get to have fun with a puzzle to defeat the adventurers with what you have at hand! The adventurers you draw are important, but the ability to think on your feet and set up crazy chains of events and wacky situations to win is even more important! Positioning yourself to take and destroy an injured paladin here is also a LOT of fun!

So to sum it up: it's a game with a lot of subtle interaction, that rewards the ability to think on your feet, adjust to an ever changing situation and looks fantastic. What's not to like?

I want to comment (again) about the opinions I've seen that there are not enough meaningful decisions. I agree that at the start you end up with "I need gold, so I'll mine gold" situations. The more you play, you prevent getting into that position, or get screwed HARD by someone and learn the lesson... plan ahead. What I see a lot of new players missing is the fact that the mistake was not necessarily that they didn't have enough gold, but maybe that they did not have enough imps and didn't mine up some extra gold the time the mined prior to that.... missing that the 'bad' decision was actually an imp shortage NOT a gold shortage. The result was not enough gold and a dead letter or three for your trouble.

Not my kind of game.  However Dungeon Lords did hold my interest longer than most games like it.  I generally don't consider that the theme of a game holds much sway with me, but I do believe that I played this longer than I otherwise might have do to the theme.  So there's that.

RATING: 8
Very engaging first series of plays! This game reminds me of a twisted version of "Kingsburg," but here the bad guys take turns building up their dungeons for the end of the year when the good guys come - instead of the other way around. Lots of tongue in cheek references! Also very reminiscent of "Dungeon Keeper" the PC game (undoubtedly an influence). Players compete to see who can imprison more "good guys" while preserving as much as possible of what they have built. In what I consider a sop to political correctness, or a way to persuade some that this can be an innocent family game, heroes are "imprisoned," not killed, and the baddies merely "knocked out" for the rest of the season. Ok, sure...

The game consists of two complete years of four seasons each, with players getting three actions per season (from a menu of eight). Thus, twenty-four actions each per game and every one counts! Actions for each season are chosen secretly and revealed simultaneously then resolved in order. Each action "target" can only accommodate three players each season, so it is possible to find you've been shut out of one or more of your precious allotment of actions. Another cool feature is the "Evil Meter" which tracks your "reputation." The more evil you get raises the possibility of attracting the tougher heroes who all score the same in the end (with some exceptions) so managing this is another important aspect of game play. Combat is engaging and surprisingly deep while being familiar at the same time. Oh yes, and you need to make sure you can feed your monsters, and pay taxes on the dungeon you've built as well. Nevertheless, the game plays smoothly and relatively quickly for a game that has a lot going on in it.

On the negative side, the quite fiddly scoring (vaguely reminiscent of Agricola) at the end would have been greatly aided by score sheets that the game chose not to provide. I expect a fan generated score sheet to be one of the first files to be uploaded. That aside, I was very favorably impressed. Rating score is preliminary, stay tuned...

To early to really give this a 'real' rating, either it's a 8 (or a 9) or a 3 or a 4! For now I'm going with 7.

What I like - the theme, really seems to work for me at the moment.

What I don't like: Blind action - this is a lottery, guess right and be in the right place in the turn order and you do well. Some people like this sort of thing, I don't (much).

Distribution of heroes - it's (relatively) easy to put yourself as 'most evil' and with the right game play the least - but in the middle its another lottery as to your position. Meaning you might get that priest you really don't want, or you might not ...

I think it only really works with 4, currently not a problem as everyone wants to try it. However once the cult of the new move on to the next shiny release only working for 4 could be a major reason for it not getting played.

And it feels like a missed opportunity too - quite fiddly for actual 'game' - and I'd have much prefered a brain controlling the adventurers raiding your dungeon, say having 2 parts of the game. One where you build a dungeon and another where you build a team of dungeon raiders to go raid an opponent's dungeon.

So as it stands, mixed feelings - really need to play it a bit more to decide if all the minuses outweigh the currently 'it feels so cool' theme.

* Update, played again and I was a little surprised to find the shine was off this totally. I just found it a mix of dull and annoying - I don't really get why this needs a blind selection mechanic at all.

** Update, now have a copy, so I'll get a chance to play 2 and 3 player games too, rating might change, or it will hit the trade pile!

** Update - now tried it with 2 and 3 and I've changed my mind, it works fine with both. Still wish blind action selection wasn't the main mechanic, but it's seeing play, and not on the trade pile (for the moment), rating increased to 6

Surprisingly heavy game considering the theme.  Comes off as an unapologetic gamer's game.  I felt it was a bit like a more complicated Galaxy Trucker with worker placement elements.  

There's a lot of complexity (took an hour to teach, two hours to play), and I can't help but think that outside of a particular niche, the game won't have much appeal.  Of course, I'm in that niche, so yay for me.

Played twice so far.  My initial reaction is that the theme is clever but the actual gameplay isn't that inspiring.  DL is good for some laughs but I'm not sure if it has legs.

*edit*With more plays under the belt I'm comfortable giving DL a 5.0 rating.  The theme is good for some laughs, but the actual gameplay seems tedious and tightly scripted.  I prefer a little more chaos and meyhem in my dungeon themed titles.  Too often I feel like I'm following a formula rather than building an evil empire and that formula won't let the game go off the rails or dole out too much fun at once.

Vlaada had a better mixture of fun, chaos and stucture in Galaxy Trucker.

After more plays I've decided that this game is a stinker.  A slow, painful unfun flowchart.  Sold.

Cada jugador gestiona una mazmorra. El juego se desarrolla en dos años y al final de cada año, cada mazmorra sufrirá la vista de unos héroes dispuestos a conquistar la mazmorra. Durante los turnos previos al final de cada año, el jugador deberá gestionar sus recursos y aprovisionarse de trampas, contratar monstruos y construir galerías y habituaciones en su mazmorra para prepararse al combate final.  El sistema de combate es muy original y es más parecido a un "acertijo" que a una batalla convencional. Muy original.

Cuesta un poco coger la mecánica. Al menos a mí. Pero me parece un juego muy recomendable. 

Lo conocí en las CLBSK  de Abril de 2010

Me lo regalaron Patri y Javi por mi cumple en Julio 2011. Gran regalo!!! (no se lo he dicho a nadie, pero es el que más ilusión me hizo.. :)

Differen worker placement game, where the worker placement is just a part of the game.
The game is more towards building and defending a dungeon.

It's strategic game where you must think ahead to manage well.

I think it's good game with a lot of things to think about all the time.
It's a gamers game.

One thing is for sure, Dungeon Lords has a beautiful board and fairly nice components. The gameplay is fun and challenging, and while it isn't my favorite game, I do enjoy playing it from time to time. The imps are really cute too! (Is that something an evil overlord should be saying?)

Very thematic game. 

I like the combat rounds best, although there is no interacton with other players. 

The resource management/acquiring game is less original but the cute Imps make up for that.
All in all, the material is of standard quality, although the cards are sub-par (just like Galaxy Trucker back then).

After several games, I realized, that you have more influence than you think at the beginning. It is very important to take into account the actions other players might play.

In three out of four games, there was one player who did not get the combat system at all and who ended up around 0 points.

Probably the most brutal rules explanation and setup for any game we have ever played. Over 45 mins from the guy who had already read the rules until we started playing (no one had played before though). Once we did, it was pretty good, and I can see how it should be more enjoyable on repeated plays. My main gripe with the game is the fun part is figuring out how your monsters / traps will kill the adventurers, and that only happens twice in the entire game. 

Was fun, but don't know how often this one would hit the table with better choices out there, especially at this game's length. If on our next play we can get a game to come in under 90 minutes, I think we would play it more and my rating may go up.

This game is less about winning victory points as trying your best to build a dungeon which can somehow survive against the onslaught of those pesky adventurers!  There's a lot to learn straight off but, once you get into it, the gameplay is actually quite straightforward.  I'd give this game a [9] or maybe even a [10] if it went to 5 players; as it stands, it's unable to hit the table very often. And I can't see it being particularly satisfying with only 2 or 3 players either, which is quite restrictive.

The most overhyped game from Essen 2009.

Over wrought, tabulating, euro resource management with the charm of bookkeeping. Top that with a silly theme, random tiles with simultaneous action selection in which you have no control.  Little to no return of fun for time invested. It felt like I was so busy doing administrative management that it was like work.

A euro (a lousy one at that) that tries to masquerade as a 'cool' AT.

Quatsch.

PS the room that adds +2 VP to every title is totally broken.

Interesting game, great theme, cool components and solid game mechanics. There's less interaction than in other Chvátil games and basically it's a rather typical worker placement game. Game is for gamers and there's hefty amount of rules to cope with in the first game.

This is one of the bears of my collection. Has been in the pile "To play" for forever and I finally got it to the table yesterday night.

I had fun although a lost miserably due to a terrible second year. I had fun, but this is a game that needs care, attention and much work.

We played three solid hours. I give that this was the first game so things had to be checked, but I'm not sure I could keep the game under the two hours even with more experience.

I like it, but it sets the bar high for bringing it to the table. Will stay in my collection, this is a good catch.

I love the theme. DungeonKeeper the boardgame. Yay!
You can build traps, rooms, hire monsters, fight the good guys...and do it again...and do it again...and again...and... play something else.

It's a really fun game but it wears off pretty fast. There are always the same 3 monsters and the same 5 traps (not the actual numbers but it really feels like that). More versatility would improve that game so much. Until then it is a "Yeah, well, one round and then we'll get another game, ok?"

Although we played with a number of incorrect rules, the game still worked out okay, although we did all end up with far too many points at the end.  I suspect with the right rules there would be more tension and some more difficult decisions.  We had it too easy, so this review is certainly up for review.

However, the game itself was a little too fiddly for my taste.  I tend to like clean games with minimal rules and strategic complexity.   This just seemed to be complex all round.

Combines elements we have seen before with a unique combat system that can be a bit of a brain burner.  There are a ton of things to try to manage in this game: getting a good combination of monsters and traps, manipulating the evilometer so that you get the adventurers that are the easiest for you to defeat given your resources, building out your dungeon so that you can tuck point scoring rooms away out of danger...  I like it!  Great with 4 players.  Haven't tried it with less yet.

RATING: 7.5
There's a lot to like here but the confusing layout of the rules rather inhibit you from striking up a quick acquaintance - trying to pick up and play took much longer than it should for a game which isn't really that complex mechanically - even if the number of options it offers, combined with the limited number of actions available, means that it is far from straightforward and presents some interesting and difficult decisions.

On first play I liked most of this quite a lot - the theming, approach and many of the detailed game mechanisms are attractive and work well - but I have a nagging doubt over the action choice system.  Actions are the major decision points in the game and you have a very limited number of them - the fact that you can be shut out of even one action seems too significant a factor in a game of this length and it can happen too many times for my taste - not quite at random but at times that is the case.  All part of the game perhaps but it is something which could and should have been done better.

Second and third plays confirm those impressions - a fun game, yes, but with a little too much randomness for the length/weight for my taste.  The variability of the spells is a particular feature I didn't spot first time out - oh how I laughed when my dragon was turned into a sheep - all very well if it hadn't wiped out the results of two or three rounds of planning which set me to buy it and another couple of rounds planning how best to use it offensively - all for naught!  So, play and enjoy - but don't try to take it seriously.

RATING: 5
I've tried to like Dungeon Lords, but 4 plays in, I have to say it just doesn't do much for me. The theme doesn't get traction for me, the pacing seems off, and it seems like there is just too much stuff going on for not enough payoff. It needed to be streamlined, cleaned up, something - some edges filed down (like the really awkward Ghosts) would be a good start, but also maybe narrowing the resources, or accomplishing more with action cards and less with game mechanisms - something. The game as it is, to my mind, is just too unwieldy and not thematically interesting enough. It needed more efficient, more organic theme and better pacing and story development.

This a game that's in a very tough space, fairly abstract resource management, in which there is just a lot of stuff I'd rather play. Dungeon Lords is distinct enough mechanically to justify occasional play, but unfortunately its significant complexity problems militate against this. Galaxy Trucker isn't all that similar a game, but it pushes a lot of the same buttons for me, and is just so much more fun. And the humor in Galaxy Trucker is so much more effective and endearing; trying to use basically the same schtick in Space Alert and Dungeon Lords has become tiresome, especially given the humor has gone from a quirky sidelight to the game that enhanced the ambiance to being overbearing enough to be an impediment to actually playing it.

Given this theme - essentially, that of bad D&D - I think both Cutthroat Caverns and Thunderstone are much more evocative and fun, as well as being far better-paced and more exciting. Dungeon Lords is just an average euro with a dungeon-building veneer. OK, but I think it's getting hit in my opinion because this is such great thematic concept, a game that actually embraced it and made it its own could be really fun. But Dungeon Lords seems like just another euro to me.

RATING: 7
While I wasn't sure the game length was worth the payout after my first play, the game seemed to be a little quicker the second time around, absolving that fear.  However, it's still a game with enough rules to where it's not an easy game just to bring out and recall all the rules to.

One thing I dislike is simultaneous action selection in general.  Specifically, I've always disliked when everyone picks their actions and reveals at the same time.  It just feels like a crap shoot to me, which can stink in a game where so much is riding on every action.  The game gives you a little information at least, since each player has two face up cards which they can't play per turn.  This made it much better for me than typical simultaneous action selection games, but I still don't all that much care for the mechanic.

Complaints aside, building up your dungeon and protecting it from the pesky humans is still a fun exercise, and this theme is really what makes the game shine!  It's somewhat like Galaxy Trucker where you build up your ship and hope it survives.  Here, you build your dungeon and do your best to equip it in fighting off the bands of heroes.

Overall, I'd say this is a decent game to me, but I'd have to be in the right mood to play it.  I can see both fans of the euro and fans of more thematic games getting along on this one as well, which seems few and far between in games!  These Czech guys really know how to make 'em!

Updated 5/13/10.

I've only played the full game once, so all I can say at this point is:

1. The art and components are top-notch. 
2. Mechanics from all of Vlaada's games make appearances, so if you love his work, you'll probably enjoy this one.
3. Going through the rulebook, although a 2-hour game itself, was pretty awesome.  
4. Holy hell, there's a lot of stuff going on here. 

It seems like it should be an awesome combination of some of my favorite mechanics.  In practice, I couldn't juggle that many balls and ended up not having much of a plan at all (does "Buy a bunch of shit and throw it all at the adventuring party" count?).  The action selection phase is a simple risk/reward proposition, but the amount of risk undermines a lot of the ability to plan.  Similarly, while the practice battles all have a neat, optimal solution, the actual ones rarely do.  In all likelihood, it's just a game that needs practice. 

One big drawback of the game is the amount of downtime spent on maintenance.  It just feels unnecessarily fiddly.  Each turn, you make a quick decision (play three cards from your hand), then spend 5 minutes resolving them: Each player, in turn, announces the first unannounced card and places a little worker man.  Once all the worker men are placed, each space on the board is resolved by giving the worker man back along with some pre-determined benefit.  There has to be a more elegant way to accomplish the same thing.     

By reusing mechanics, I do feel like Vlaada's competing against himself a little bit.  I generally prefer Space Alert for programming, and Galaxy Trucker is faster and more chaotic for the build-up-tear-down gameplay, and Through the Ages is just an over-all better game if I'm going to spend this length of time on something.  I would need to be in the right mood to want to play this over the others.  

That last sentence sounds like a 6 to me.  Which seems right (similar to Pandemic; Race for the Galaxy). 

2/1/11:  I had played twice previously, with 2 and with 3, and found it tedious. My negative reaction to it strengthened as it shot up the BGG rankings shortly thereafter, irrationally praised as being "thematic" by people who like funny pictures of fantasy creatures and sculpted plastic bits. I played it again yesterday for the first time in roughly a year (this time with 4), and I found myself enjoying it a fair bit (despite still being somewhat tedious). It's certainly something that I could see myself wanting to play again. It now sits at #35 overall for me, one of my highest 6s.

This is an interesting, deep game that offers great strategic options.  You spend the entirety of the game building up your dungeon and its defenses so that you can weather the storm of the oncoming heroes.  

For some reason, the game has this subtle annoying factor that belies its strength for me (hence why I haven't rated it higher).  The act of having everything you built be destroyed and trodden upon is a bit aggravating.  I'm ok with this quality in other Vlaada games, although here it grates on my nerves for some reason.

After one play, there are some interesting things going on. The basic meat of the game is a Wallenstein-style action selection for placing workers. After that, all the rest of the interesting decisions are how you manage your resources, one of which is your evil level compared to others. It's funny how you want to be less evil so you attract the weaker heroes. I don't particularly care for how the evil meter is implemented and consider it the main drawback to the game as I feel it is too easy to manage and there is no reason to be truly evil and no penalty for being nice. I do however find that the paladin is an awesome addition and I am more than willing to play again for the mini game of trying to figure out the best way to stop the heroes.

Also, the 2 and 3 player rules are a terrible hack, this game should really be 4 player only.

22/07/2012 - I actually liked this more than dungeon petz. Decisions are a bit more complex and there are actually more real decisions than petz as resources are rarer. There is not as much competition per say as there are three of each resources. But you will have to double guess others and get the best choice. It makes it interesting all the time.

13/04/2013 - sold it for the second time.  Not getting enough plays.

RATING: 7
Rated 8 after one play. I've played a number of "worker placement" games before trying this one, so my enthusiasm and the novelty of this game is really a reaction to all the other fun and challenging things this game throws at you. I really enjoyed balancing all the various resources, the puzzle of defeating the "good guys" with the right traps and monsters, and the clever rotation of available actions. 

From what I've seen, most Chvatil games are very unique, but titles like this one, Galaxy Trucker, and Space Alert share a few attributes: 1) You need to learn to tolerate luck and uncertainty, but there's often features that allow you to peek into the hidden information, 2) what you build can be torn apart and you will enjoy it, and 3) great themes reinforce game mechanics.

Dungeon Lords has one of the best themes of any game I've played. I've tried a number of different Euros where corn/cloth/ore/spices/blah/blah/whatever eventually devolved into grabbing "gray cubes" and "red cubes." Not so with this one. Gold, food, monster and traps... these things are very memorable simply because the engaging theme reinforces the relationships.

I need to try this again, as the first game is certainly a learning game.

- Multiplayer solitaire. The game. You could easily substitute the very little interaction with other players with a random dice roll and get ~ same experience.   
- ~3 hours long (~30-40 minutes of which were rule explaining). 
- Set length. Yes that's a con - few too many building phases and 4(?) combat phases meaning you can't even force the game to end any sooner. 
- Ported to a video game setting the whole 3 hour campaign would translate to ~20 minutes single player tower defense (Paladins Must Die 3). Hence there is no need for this game to exist.
- Rating 1 not because it is not a game but because I wouldn't be caught dead playing it.

The personal favourite of my private collection. Theme and gameplay are a blast!
This game has seen a lot of play in our group and 90-120 minutes are a realistic timeframe for a round with an experienced troupe. If you have new players get ready for mor like four hours.Its hard to learn and, even if you know the game, well it can be very very hard and oh boy, can that game be punishing!
Player interaction is limited, but observing your opponent's gameplay is tantamount to success. You always have to be aware of their needs as the other's command, and choice of monsters, chambers, have direct impact on what your choice of action should be.
With new players allways keep in mind to prepare them of what they will have to face in this game! Its one that you must play over and over again before you really get a feeling on how your choices will affect your success or demise.
Start with the easy version, play the full version only if you have nothing to loose in life, and if you really want to know pain (or if you just want more player interaction) use the "minions with gifts" expansion. (The chips for that are in the Core Game and the rules can be downloadet at their homepage)
Players need a thick hide in this game. If, for example, you have a bad first year where the heroes conquer your whole dungeon, you might have the whole second half of the game in front of you without a chance to catch up with other players until the final rating and ranking. In a case like this, stop playing to win! Play for the sake of a good time with your friends, or that cafeteria for your witches and trolls. A themed dungeon awards extra VP after all. Then give those second year heroes a good thrashing to regain at least some of your glory!
In addition each dungeon lord has their presonal goal of scoring more than 0 points in the end. You want to keep your DungeonKeeper-License, Lord, dont' you?

Excellent theme that is sadly so underused.  Good gameplay, however, slightly disappointing in the extent to which one can build and populate their dungeons - which is kepy purposefully minimal. This is an aspect that I would have liked to have seen expanded significantly... all tied into the puzzle-based end of round beatdown. Functional, but a little dry (despite the theme, somehow!). Also loses a point for being fairly dependent around having 4 players.

I loved my first play of this game. I want to play it, but teaching Dungeon Lords to new players is a total pain. I've reached the point where I have to re-learn the rules anyway so I might as well teach some new players while I'm at it.

I have played it a few times with two players and it was still tons of fun. You have a few more things you need to manage, but using the dummy players gives you some cool opportunities to control what space you land on and potentially screwing your opponent.

I will always be happy the play this game with experienced players. I will still probably run away screaming from new players.

1 learning game (4p, 4.5 hrs). Heroic teaching job by D. I can see why so many people enjoy the game (250 geek ratings of 10, always want to play). Like Agricola, however, it seems like a well-designed eurogame that is not right for my tastes. With this level of rules details and play time, I would rather play a multiplayer wargame. The combat system reminded me of Ghost Stories. I'm willing to give it another try.

Great worker placement game with a twist that all players plan all of their workers' placements at the same time, then reveal in order.  On top of that, it has a great theme that all players are evil-doers building up their dungeon but pesky NPC "adventurers" keep coming along to ruin the dungeon.
As a bonus, the rule book is actually fun to read.

Chvatil sure hits a lot of home-runs.

Here, the theme is playful (like Galaxy Trucker) however the gameplay is much deeper and thoughtful.  The game is bigger and longer than I appreciated out of the box. I'm looking forward to more play with this one. 

The graphic representations are very helpful in keeping things straight. It looks busy at first, but once you realize what things mean there is no need for much in the way of player aids.

My first game of this was underwhelming.  Since then, I've come to enjoy it more but find it more stressful than I like as I constantly teeter on the edge of penury and disaster.  My kids (8 and 10 as I write this) really love it, though, so that brings it up a bit for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Dungeon Lords is another game in the genre of "you build it and the game tries to destroy it" that I've enjoyed to varying degrees, with Galaxy Trucker probably being the best example in recent memory.

Dungeon Lords uses a programmed, blind action selection mechanism where players select the actions they want to take, and then move their worker pawns out onto the central board where they can get things like monsters, new rooms, traps, and the like. The trick is that being second is better than first at most things, and being fourth means you get nothing. Doing this, you collect dungeon pieces and, at times, evil points which are essentially a way to punish someone for getting better stuff in the collecting stuff phase. Being too evil is very bad because the more dangerous adventurers are drawn to the dungeons of those who were most evil over the course of the game. After each sequence of 4 rounds, the aforementioned adventurers come calling and try to trash the place, and you get to throw monsters and traps at them, hopefully killing them in the process. You do this twice and hopefully have the best dungeon standing at the end of the game.

I enjoyed my play of the game, but I think it's a bit a cumbersome for what it actually offers at the end of the day. My favourite part of this is the same thing that is my favourite part of Galaxy Trucker: seeing my place destroyed or survive. The problem is that this game takes significantly longer. Though I certainly like the theme, I don't think this offers enough to justify regular play on my part. Play on the part of experienced folks would probably drop playtime, which would increase my enjoyment, but I don't think this will be ever something that I suggest myself, mainly because I don't care for blind simultaneous action selection as a central mechanic in games that are longer than 15 minutes. If this isn't a problem for you and you like the theme of the game, then your mileage may vary significantly.

RATING: 6
I adore the theme.  I find the gameplay tedious.  There are too many arbitrary limits on what can be done, how, by whom, when... but worst of all, again, we have a highly logical, deep planning game totally sabotaged by random elements that cannot be controlled.  If a game is to be entirely decided by randomness, it needs to be very short and cute, not give the appearance of complexity and meaning.

Played with a light heart, talking smack about the theme and not really caring how it turns out, you can have a fun time with this.  Just don't try to win too hard... you'll only be disappointed.

The production is excellent and the rulebook is another fantastic humorous read. The translation of these rules from Czech never ceases to amaze me!

A slightly higher than average downtime prevents me from rating this a 10, although it was immensely fun.

Maybe in a dozen games, I can get to the double digits.

Dungeon Lords is a big game with a lot of thinking behind it but it's not my cup of tea for some reasons.

1) It plays slow and scripted
There is too much cube-pushing. Placing the minions and resolving the actions is slow and clunky 
Long solo parts like the puzzle-solving attacks to you dungeon are annoying.
The game is divided in hundreds of phases but this do not encode "game", it is all accountancy. A progress bar tells me what to do all the time. Feels like playing a video game (like Dungeon Keeper) being the computer and not the players.

2) Lack of player interaction
In Dungeon Lords you are in serious difficulties for surviving, the game itself is like a giant machine that will snap your fingers if you don't put enough attention.
It has several mechanisms to screw you up when you are too powerful (like taxes, like payday, like paladins) and this mechanisms force similar strategies to all players (like digging after taxes, recruiting monsters after payday)
So, given that any player interaction is done through the blind minion placement and that the game is difficult enough by itself, there is very little chance that you can play "against" you opponents instead of just trying to do "something" quick and useful for you.
The reverse resolution sequence of some actions like monsters and rooms adds only confusion and frustration to the strategy.

3) Scoring
The final score system is just indecent. And slow

4) Art
The drawings on the board are nice, unfortunately they are covered by wooden bits all the time and you don't see em. The drawings on the board are individually nice but all together form a complex and amorph mass of colors that makes me sick. The spaces on the board have no clear delimitation and the pictures have so much detail that need a close inspection to decide what's in every space and what's it for.

Fantasztikus játék, nagyon tetszett elsőre. Másodjára kiütközött az a hibája, hogy ha egyetlen dolgot félrenéz az ember (gondolok itt első sorban a csata menetére), akkor szinte az addigi minden cselekedete kárba veszhet. Egyrészt ezt tudomásul kell venni annak aki leül vele játszani (hasonlóan, mint amikor egy kockadobálós játéknál úgy ülünk le játszani, hogy elfogadjuk: a szerencse befolyásolhatja a végeredményt), másrészt viszont emiatt egyelőre nem 10-es a játék. Nagyon jó vétel volt, nagyon jó játék. Remélem a következő 1-2 parti feltornássza 10-esre a pontjait! :)

Probably a little premature to rate this after 1 play, especially when I was not feeling well, and I couldn't even understand the full rules until the game was basically over. I still managed to win somehow. I only went for repeatable monsters, which seem to be super good. Maybe with more experienced players those become harder to get. It could be due to me not being at 100%, but I'm not entirely sure the game really needs the amount of complexity it has. Doesn't grab nearly as much as Vlaada's big three: Prophecy: Through The Ages, Galaxy Trucker.

Edit: After reading various forums here, it appears the person who taught us the game missed a lot of rules. Oops. Really changed the game. Need to play again and review rating.

Dungeon Lords suffers in my opinion from two problems. The first is that the game creates this [i]hugely complex[/i] dungeon attack and defense mechanism which subsequently gets executed [i]twice[/i] in the entire game. I consider it inexcusable that so much game real estate is effectively wasted on a mechanism which is only seldomly used. If there had been more attacks on the dungeon the rules burden for this aspect would have been a lot less problematic, I think. The second problem is that Vlaada appears to consider it a good idea to play for silly goals which detract from the actual process of [i]winning[/i]. He violates Knizia's tenet that the goal of a game is to win, but that it is the goal that is important, and not the winning. It may appeal to people who play 'just because' and, indeed, 'just want to build a great dungeon', but really, purchase a set of LEGO bricks, and construct your own dungeon if that is so important to you. Dungeon Lords is marketed as a [i]game[/i], and under those circumstances the rather weak end scoring makes it difficult to treat this title as a game worth playing—i.e., with winning in mind.

That said, the worker placement mechanicsm which ties everything together is well-crafted and can be played without nearly a word of explanation thanks to the clear iconography. But since it all comes together again in just two attack waves of a bunch of goody-gooders, I didn't feel particularly challenged to do my best here. Put another way: if I want to play a construction puzzle I'll put out something like Shipyard or 20th Century which make the puzzle element the core of the game; and if I want to play a worker placement game, I'll pick something which emphasises that aspect. (Can't really say what at the moment; I rarely seem to enjoy WP games.) Dungeon Lords is [i]vlees noch vis[/i] as I would say in Dutch: a saying meaning, literally, that the game is neither meat nor fish, in order words, lacking substantial and unique nourishing qualities. I fear this is a characteristic of many of Vlaada's games: the ideas swirling around in that brain of his are wonderful, but they do not always lead to good [i]games[/i]... and that's a shame. He should consider teaming up with a designer who is capable of creating good games. And then wait quietly for his bank statement to hit seven or more numbers.

I love this game. This game has so much strategy and depth, as you continuously try to predict and out maneuver your opponents through two years of play. There are so many factors to keep track of, making it a challenge for even the most strategic minds. 

One disclaimer, I have not played this game with the bonus content. The base game, without the online rule book, is so much fun as is that I have never felt compelled to try the advanced rules. That's how good this game is.

While this game is heavy, I have always enjoyed it and will continue to do so. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I have.

The high ranking is for Vlaada`s immense creative effort
he puts into each of his games. The rules are always

My only complaint is you have to really invest a lot of time into understanding the rules and the general flow of the game. This is not a game for the casual gamer. You spend more time trying to understand the rules than actually playing. But if explained properly and with many replays this game should give many hours of enjoyment.If it were steamlined to shave off an hour play time this game would be pretty damned near perfect.

Neat in many ways, and wonderful theme. 

One of the major sources of interactivity is the worker-placement, and I'm not entirely fond of how that plays out - I really like that there's strong incentive to pay attention to each others' goals and try to maneuver likely placements, but find the effects of failure can be frustrating; many of the actions aren't merely [i]better[/i] or [i]worse[/i] at differing levels, but fundamentally [i]different[/i]. This is probably more interesting, but also more frustrating, and it makes planning much trickier.

Absolutamente brutal, de lo mejor que tiene Vlaada. La explicación es eterna (aunque no por ello complicado), con lo cual echa para atrás a cualquiera que no sea un friki... Es el único defecto que le veo a este juego, el ser tan grande.
Rejugabilidad? Muy grande, nunca vas a tener 2 mazmorras iguales. Interacción entre jugadores, aunque parece que poca... es completamente decisiva. Y luego, el factor puzzle, ver donde metes los monstruos para cargarte antes a los héroes... Absolutamente brillante. Una obra maestra, Vlaada.

What a great game about Dungeon Lording. It's so thematic, but so brain burning and full of subtle interactions. A great game with satisfying feeling after playing it. The only downside is the game is not really on epic scale.

RATING: 6
Components: Gorgeous components, doing much to aid in the thematic immersion. I appreciate the minor details that differentiate the various adventurers. The iconography is clear, despite so many different functions being communicated. The imps are great.

Experience: First game, two players, clocked in at 4.5 hours. Wow; that's epic (that includes rules and the four training scenarios). There seems to be a disjoint between the order resolution and the combat phase. So much of the game hinges on what happens during combat, and there is such a puzzle element to defeating the encroaching adventurers efficiently, that the game might be better served to minimize the amount of time spent outside of the combat phase (e.g. by simplifying the order resolution). Very eager to try again. With those nasty do-gooder Paladins romping about it doesn't pay to be evil! (The scoring is disheartening; to spend so long on a game, and only earn four points as my reward.)

Second game, a slim 2 hours. Absolutely brutal. This is an unforgiving game. There were several order phases where I miscalculated and ended up either taking zero actions with my minions, or actually being a bit worse off because of my actions (e.g. investing my resources in a monster, who I then was unable to feed come payday). Unlike in many other games, my mistakes do not necessarily benefit my opponent. There is little we can do during the orders phase to adjust to miscalculations, and the combat phase is just an all-out brawl with the adventurers, throwing everything we've got at them to keep them out of our precious dungeon. This game is very difficult to play.

Third game. Just too brutal. I shoot myself in the foot, and my foot shoots back. My mistakes are hard to foresee, and even more difficult to correct. The combat phase is so much more fun than the worker placement phase; I'd much prefer to have a game that focused mostly on the combat. I don't think I'll be playing this again.

I love the components and the theme of this game. I also like the way you get resources. The combat is a little unnusual, but after 2 rounds, I got a feel for it and I think I like it as well. It's tough the first through, but I can't wait to play it again.

I really really dont like this game. I've scored positive points in the game 1 time had zero once and the other 2 games were much worse. I just cant seem to get monsters or traps that can beat the adventures I get, when I do get some decent stuff going the spell ruins my day.

Still not sure what I think of this game after two plays.  I know the more I play it the more I'll like it, but is it worth the investment?  It's got so many fiddly things to keep track of.

Revisited and now I like the game.  I think if I just let the game flow through me and try not to control and understand everything that's going on I can like it.  Took it from a 6 to a 7.

I like this worker placement euro-esque game more than Agricola! It's shorter but provides the same amount of terror preparing for the battle phase. The theme is also adorable. The artwork is lovely - I especially love the abominable snowman making a snowman on the season track.

Don't let the somewhat goofy art style fool you, this worker placement game from Vlaada Chvatil is not for the faint of heart. There are a lot of rules and the game is very complex and unforgiving with a steep learning curve, but once it clicks it's definitely one of the more rewarding worker placement games out there. Nothing tops watching your well-oiled machine of a dungeon mow down an intrepid party of adventurers. Definitely recommended.

RATING: 4
Playing with less than 4 increases the AP-factor significantly because there are dummy players. Why have them? No one likes dummy players. If they exist at all, they should be relegated to the awkward 2-player variants that so many games seem obligated to provide.  

Also, there are a lot of rules. More than Space Alert or even base Galaxy Trucker, despite being a close relative of those games.  

Thus, it needs 4 players, has lots of rules, and is more fiddly than two very enjoyable titles.  As a result, it doesn't get played.

A very good "indirect" euro style game.  

This game also combines elements from many great games like puerto rico and settlers of catan, but adds in a dramatic twist to goal choosing.  Quite frankly the path to victory is not clearly defined and it takes quite a bit of thought to figure out how to overcome the challenges before you, but that is the beauty of the design.  

For example, instead of drawing a finish line for a the players and telling them to run, the designer provided a framework of paths, many of which simply will not work every game.  This helps overcome the issues associated with players figuring out the "path of least resistance" and using that strategy every game.  

Fun game, but can be quite challenging for some players.  "Euro gamers" find it difficult to figure out what to do since the path to victory isn't laid down in stone, while many "old school" strategy gamers seem to do just fine.  

EDIT:  After playing this game for about 8 months I'm downgrading my rating from 9.2 to 7.5

There is strategy involved in this game, but this game is ruthlessly random.  

You can run and attempt strategies.  For example, picking up smaller creatures and supplementing with traps works.  The problem is that the events are very harsh (time and time again) and the limited resources almost always push a player out of what they need.  

What this does is prevents players from getting ahead with skill, and puts quite alot of game into the realm of luck.  IMO, some luck is a good thing, too much ruins it.

What a cute game.  Underneath the cuteness, though, there are some teeth.  

Update:  I have reduced my rating to 6 from 8.  This game is a ton of fun to play.  Unfortunately, there is a complete disconnect between playing it and scoring it that leaves me cold.  In a more abstract economic game this sort of disconnect could make me more anxious to play it more and decipher it, but that is not what I want out of this cute game about imps building a dungeon to deal with those pesky adventurers.

Vlaada is batting 1000 for me so far!  Dungeon Lords is his take on worker placement and our first game was a lot of fun.  There's a lot going on and it's tough to see the full picture during your first play but I really thought the game nailed the theme. Build up your dungeon, get monsters and traps and try to squish the heroes as they march through.  Fun, thematic worker placement game.

A funny game with nice mechanics. Its somehow similiar to Agricola. Step 1: Built up your dungeon (farm). Step 2 Fight (Harvest). Step 3: Earn VP.

nothing. So my concern with DL is its replayability.

RATING: 6
I'm not sure the game is rewarding enough for the amount of effort required. It is very, very difficult to keep track of all the facets of gameplay and the game is really long (assuming any real effort to plan and take things into account).

I do love the theme, and the rulebook is certainly amusing, and the mechanics do work very well and are creative, but the game may simply be too hard--and may have too much luck for such a hard game.

Add to that the fact that I'm generally playing with either 2 or 5 players, and this game just doesn't seem to have a great place. (The game only plays 2-4 and the 2-player game involves two dummy players--it's not great. The game demands, really, exactly 4 players.)

In the end, roleplaying the characters and situations is more fun than actually playing the "game"... and if we're going to roleplay, I'd much prefer an RPG--or something relatively mindless like Cutthroat Caverns.

There are a bunch of neat ideas in this game, and the components are pretty cool.  I enjoy the math-puzzle nature of the adventurer attacks.  However, the blind action selection mechanism is a tragedy.  It reduces the game's only direct player interaction to simple guesswork, and the way the order of the blind selections affects the costs and benefits of each action is just weird (and allows for a bad guess or two to really hurt one's position long-term).  In a simpler game it wouldn't be so bad, but this one requires a fair amount of mental effort -- too much for the random screwage of the action selection to be fun.

I'm interested in trying the game with open action selection, because I do like a lot of what it offers.  We'll see.

After playing Dungeon Lords again, I have to up my rating a little bit. Once I got all the small rules details down and could come up with kind of a plan, the game became more enjoyable.

[2009-11-02 Rating: n.a. -> 6]
Summary:
---------
In Dungeon Lords, you are a dungeon lord trying to build the best dungeon out there. To achieve that, you are given the timespan of two years. Each year is divided into two distinct phases.

First Phase - Resource Collection: 
You have three workers that you can assign to different tasks like hiring some monsters, getting little helpers called imps or plundering a village for some food. How evil you are is determined by the actions you choose.
The mechanism to select your actions reminds me very much of one of my favorite games "Wallenstein": All players select the three tasks they want to perform simultaneously by playing three action-cards face down on their player-mat. After everyone has finished their selection, the workers will be assigned. Note that it is possible, that the spot you wanted to have isn't available to you anymore because the other players already took it. This phase is repeated four times.

Second Phase - Defend your dungeon:
Based on your decisions in the first phase, you are assigned some heroes that now enter your dungeon and you try to defend them with the traps and monsters you purchased in the first phase.
Basically, this is a puzzle each player has to solve on their own.

After two years the game is over and you are awarded points for your remaining dungeon and the heroes you could imprison during the second phase. In addition, there are some titles like "Evil lord with most dungeon tiles" which will get you more points.

The player with the most points is declared the winner.

Comments:
--------------
* Dungeon Lords is a quite fiddly game. You have to remember a lot of small things in order to play the game (well). In this regard it reminded me of the solo-game of Race for the Galaxy: There is so much book-keeping that I had to do that I just wished, this was a computer-implementation. I wouldn't call this game elegant in any way.

* There's isn't too much player-interaction. You can try to annoy the other players by taking what you think they want, but you can't really plan this.

* At it's core, this is a worker-placement-game and in this regard it has too much luck (spells, available monsters and traps) for my liking.

This has a hell of a learning curve, especially for new gamers. Plan three to four hours for your first game including training/instructions.

But it's a great game. Balance seems to be there, lots of options, and still plenty to do if you're behind. The cut-throat tends to be indirect.

A second game should flow much faster, even with the added rules.

I like a lot of the game, including the oft maligned double think aspect of trying to out-anticipate what your opponents will do when.  But what I don't like it how long this game drags on.  It would be fine at one year, probably, but I don't know what that would do to end game scoring.  If ever I'm cajoled into playing I might try to find out.

Seriously, this was not a fun game.

First, there's almost zero player interaction - it's just you against the game. Next, the choices you make in the game are nowhere near intuitive. In fact, it feels pretty much like a crapshoot. I came in second place, and I have no idea how I managed to do it.  Finally,  the whole game felt more like work than play. I work all week, I don't need to do it when I'm gaming.

Believe me, I can understand why other people might like this game, just not me.

Bottom line: My motto is: "If it ain't fun, don't play it", and this was not fun. I don't recommend this game to anyone.

A great theme but one which is not really engaged with by the game. 

- The main mechanic is worker placement, perhaps not the main job criteria you would associate with an evil overlord - 'Dungeon Lords: The HR department'.
- The dungeons you build are typically not much more than a few corridors and a couple of rooms - hardly a labyrinth of despair.
- The combat portion of the game is an AP prone puzzle and, though quite interesting and challenging, does not conjure up the high drama of you marshalling your hordes to overwhelm the adventurers.
- The game also runs too long and has too much fiddly rules overhead.
- 'Fun' is in short supply.

Also, the worker placement element is quite tight, which I rarely like in worker placement/action selection games. You can get completely screwed by not being able to get to a particular placement slot, to the extent of your game being almost over at the half-way stage. Although you can second guess what opponents may do to try and mitigate the risks of placement, you can sometimes just get unlucky as to which 50-50's other players choose to go for. 

One of the more over-rated games on BGG.

SOLD - a clever, if fiddly game, but somewhat dry and I would never suggest it for play and it is too complex for play at home.

Yes, it is a worker placement game no denying that,  but it's well done and VERY thematic. Everything fits the theme perfectly which is rare in games.

I really enjoy the theme of this game.  The gathering of resources is fun...there is some angst in trying to figure out what to gather and when.  But the game really shines in the combat puzzle portion.  It's fun to see how a year's worth of work unfolds as those do-gooder adventures try to conquer your dungeon.

It's tough to understand the repurcussions of the rules on the first play.  But it gets better on the second. My rating is an 8 right now.  It would be a 9 but I'm not sure I'd *always* want to play it.

Dungeon Lords is interesting, but ultimately failed to excite me due to its complexity/interesting decision ratio. I normally am not one to shy away from complex games, but only if the pay off is worth the effort put into the game. Dungeon Lords was one where I did not feel the effort was worth it, and I eventually found myself dreading the idea of teaching it. So Dungeon Lords left my collection. I am willing to play it, but I will never teach this game again.

RATING: 9
Dungeon Lords is a game where each player is fighting the mechanics of the game (the good and noble heroes). It has building element similar to galaxy trucker (and is the same designer as galaxy trucker). It has a real sense of anticipation and it is less complicated and galaxy trucker. Each individual is focusing on themselves but you are always looking over the shoulder of the other player anticipating what they are going to do as it will affect your board as well. This element is key to sharing and involved game with your friends. The board is beautiful and there are many pieces but once you learn the concept of the game it is fairly easy to play.

RATING: 7
Players are evil lords trying to get their Dungeon Lord license.  Players spend four seasons (turns) sending out their minions to do their bidding - get food, money, tunnel out a bit of dungeon or convert a dungeon tunnel into a room, etc.  You also have to hire monsters and imps, and purchase traps.  After a year of this stuff, a party of adventurers comes looting in your dungeon, and you enter a combat mini-game.  The adventurers have to be beaten quickly, or they will render good chunks of your construction useless.  Points are tallied after to years of building, and two attacks.  Gorgeous looking game, and it's by Vlaada Chvatil so it was an auto-purchase.  However, it's a strange beast - half resource management, half tactical combat game.  Certainly getting better after 5+ plays.  Excellent rules and components, just have to see if it stays fresh and fun.

You are a dungeon lord, charged with building a deep and dangerous dungeon filled with powerful monsters and deadly traps.

This is a great game, and the only reason I sold my copy is that I think Dungeon Petz accomplishes much of the same feel in a more streamlined way.  Also, I enjoy the puzzle of taking care of the Petz more so than the puzzle of thumping the adventurers.  I will still happily play it any time, though.  I actually like the dummy player you get to control when you play with 2, and missed it a bit when we played with 4!

UPDATE Oct2014:  I sold this, but I find myself missing the game.  I've been on a worker placement binge lately, and so many games have not made the cut that I have renewed my appreciation for DL.  I intend to pick up a copy of the Happy Anniversary edition.

Vlaada has, once again, masterly meshed theme with mechanics to create an amazingly fun game.  Deciding on an early strategy is essential and yet you will quite often be forced to adjust it every step of the way.  This is a challenging game full of difficult and important decisions.  It quite often feels like you never have enough time to do all of the things you need to do - so every single action counts!  But that shouldn't scare you - it's fun as hell to be a Dungeon Lord.  :laugh:

Don't let anyone fool you into thinking otherwise, this game works great solitaire.

Got it because I felt I really needed to try this because I enjoyed the premise of dungeon keeper (or turning traditional D&D on it's head). So I really wanted to like this one.
Played half-a-game once. The game was just a bit long for us, the punishing scoring didn't go over well. And we rarely get 4 (supposedly best player count).

This is a great game from Vlaada.  Much more strategic than space alert and galaxy trucker, but still very thematic and fun.  A great experience that has a ton of replay value.

4(6) on the Cindometer (she played this game once with the proviso that I retheme it; that said, I made it all about inviting guests over to your house and showering them with gifts which made them like you; once they liked you enough they decided to stay in your guest room)

My opinion of this game has changed considerably.
There are better games which incorporate worker placement, tile placement, variable role selection.

This was a highly anticipated game for me, but on subsequent plays has fallen flat.  The theme just can't carry it anymore.

Great game but god did it give me a headache afterwards as my brain felt fried.  Mechanics of the game are interesting but it does always feel like everything is stacked against you due to little time you have to prepare for the hero attacks.  Would play again so thumbs up.

Played 3 games in one week. Enjoy it quite alot. Wonder about replay value.

For now I rate it a 9 due to the theme and mechanics of the game.

A game which has lots of explanations. Once you know the rules, game goes faster. Takes a game or two under the belt to have a good flow.

*UPDATE

Down graded from a 9 to an 8. Played a couple of games in a short period of time. Got my fill at the moment. Heard mix feelings about this game. Maybe I have a better idea why, since I played a couple of games. Stll enjoy the theme of the game.

Guess it isn't the type of game you never get tired of playing.

Good.  Don't know if this could have possibly lived up to the hype.  Worker placement ... augh.  Wish it could've been a little more interactive in the combat part; maybe if you controlled the party attacking the player to the left.  As is, it's a beautiful game and great fun watching your dungeon get trashed, but it doesn't really come together the way Galaxy Trucker or TTA does.

Even thou I liked some other games of Vlaada Chvátil, this game is just not my cup of tea. There is too much abstraction and randomness involved, that I don't see any fun to the game.

Could be talked into playing it, but I would rather play pretty much anything else offered.

Vlaada takes you into a dungeon and slaps you around. I like this well enough, but I think Dungeon Petz is better. Both games' themes are awesome.

For those who are curious about the differences, Dungeon Petz is worker placement + putting on a show. It's all about maximizing how best to prepare your pets for selling.

Dungeon Lords is action selection/programming + puzzle with a sprinkling of spatial building. It's all about preparing your dungeon to not be trampled by the incoming party.

You don't play this game to make a successful dungeon. You play this game to hope your dungeon survives all the bad things that will happen to it.

RATING: 6
I had extremely high hopes for Dungeon Lords but was let down.  I had heard this described as a worker placement game, but it's more of a simultaneous action selection game.  Sometimes you can get blocked out of an action but that tends to happen minimally.  

So what are the caveats?  For this gamer's game, there is a fairly high degree of randomness/chaos.  It's hard to plan to try and hire a specific monster (or ghost) because you may be locked out of the Hiring action the round that this specific Monster (or Ghost) is available.  Also the combat cards have a huge range of effects and amount of fatigue they deliver.  There are some ways to mitigate this but after an initial play it feels like you just have to make the best of what you have.

Another thing that I was disappointed about the number of decisions based on the length of the game.  I didn't feel it was as high of a ratio as I would have liked.  Finally, the box says 2 - 4 players, but I would never consider playing this with less than 4 players.  It would speed up the combat sequence to play with 2 or 3 players but it makes the action selection sequence a lot less enjoyable due to some random programing of a neutral player(s).

Now this may sound as if I don't like the game, however it is enjoyable and that's due to the masterfully written rulebook, wonderful artwork and great theme.  It's a euro through-and-through, but people couldn't claim euros to be themeless if more designers made games like Dungeon Lords.  The theme is so great that this is one of the few euros I can get my ameritrash-loving friends to play.

The best thing I can say, is try this one before you buy it to see if it's right for you.

RATING: 7
The standard CGE humor and atypical theme of Dungeon Lords creates an immersive game for players to explore. The action selection mechanic works to both reward late activations, and punish the last activation (potentially). This, along with the locking of use assignment cards, establishes an element of tactics that deviate enough from the standard worker placement / action selection to keep it from feeling mundane. The combat system contrasts well with the bureaucratic nature of the dungeon building, and is filled with a plethora of adventurers to keep strategies nimble. Combat resolution is wide open, which can slow the game down a bit, but also forces the lords to creatively thwart spells, plant traps, and deploy monsters. Don't let its reputation fool you. Being a tyrannical subterranean imp overlord is not as difficult as the internet would lead you to believe (though the expansions offer a myriad of ways to beef up the experience to your own liking).

The game comes with an overwhelming amount of components and a big rulebook. But after the first steps in the game it doesn't looks as complex as it seems on first sight. Almost feels like a fantasy version of Agricola (worker placement, building stuff, getting points for different achievments). I am not sure if the game is a little be to fiddly for my taste. More plays will prove if I am right or not.

I am a big Dungeon Keeper fan (computer game).  I have played all the scenarios from Dungeon Keeper 1 and Dungeon Keeper II multiple times, and install Dungeon Keeper 2 on every computer I have.  (Keeper, the dungeon floors are bumpy, imps are having a rough time playing marbles).  I have also played Dig'n'Fight click-fest browser-game.  So, bear this in mind; because I really enjoy the genre, and this could influence my rating.

Dungeon Lords is primarily a game where players are vying to protect their dungeons from the marauding heroes.  The crux of the game is to build your dungeon while trying to maneuver your 'evil' score to get the type of hero you may defeat the easiest (with traps / monsters / combination).  The frustration occurs when players 'bump' your choice of action with their choices (4 players, 3 players per action type), and reverse positioning for monsters / rooms becomes important.

I enjoy the game, and find it fairly light (note: I really enjoy 18xx, Le Havre, and Die Macher; so my 'light' score may be skewed).

Rated after 5 plays.

A deep and meaty game. Lots of things to consider, and all the decisions you make matters. It will take time to master this game, and it's a good thing because it does leave you with a desire to play it more. The theme is brilliant and really shines through. 

Two downsides - 1) it's pretty fiddly for the euro and 2)  the game could be shorter. 2+ hours is too long for a eurogame, even one as meaty as DL.

RATING: 9
This game is great fun. If you like worker placement games, aren't afraid of heavy games, and have ever played an RPG, you are going to enjoy this a lot.
The worker placement mechanic was given a great twist in this game: up to 3 workers (out of 4 players) may be placed in each resource spot, and each spot gets an overall better reward than the last one. And since worker placement is chosen secretly and simultaniously, you will have to carefuly choose what you really want (may lead to AP, though).
And then you've got the adventurers trying to destroy your dungeon, which makes for a kind of puzzle game, where you try to use your evil resources optimally to reduce the havoc!
And all the mechanics affect each other, and you will always have the feeling that you can't get everything done, which is great.
Something that might be an issue with this game is how it relies heavily on 4 players, so you are actually playing three different games whether there are 2, 3, or 4 players. Which isn't necessarily bad.

Overall, if you don't mind heavy games, you are in for a treat!

The idea sounds exciting – you’re a dungeon keeper and you need to protect your place from pesky heroes who keep invading, killing your minions, and taking your stuff. The whimsical artwork seems to support this lighthearted theme. But in practice, you’re playing a tedious worker placement game where simple actions are chopped up into micro-actions and scrambled around so the players can have the ostensible fun of piecing them back together. 

I found the experience uninspiring to say the least. Surprisingly, the focus is more on resource collection than hero fighting. They packed in plenty of accounting but went light on the fighting. The heroes entering the dungeon -- which should be the majority of the game -- happens just twice. I’m not a fan of micro-action games where simple things become extremely complicated. Chopping things up into smaller pieces that must be reassembled doesn’t create depth, it creates tedium. How about a game where you load up your dungeon frequently and fight heroes frequently? Isn’t that why we’re here? This is more like Dungeon Quartermaster. 

For a much better implementation of what I’m driving at, try [thing=173460][/thing] and see how fun it is to assemble your dungeon dudes and have them fight heroes. Oh, those damn Hobbits are annoying! Now, that's how you make someone feel like a dungeon lord.

I really like the game's theme. I never knew being a dungeon lord was this much fun.

Wow.  This game took 4 1/2 hours to play (including the tutorial and instruction time).  Be ready to commit before you play.

I thought the best part of the game was deciding how to use your resources to protect your dungeon.  Although the resource gathering phase was enjoyable as well.

I played the game again with Darquil and A.G. on Game Retreat weekend and upped its rating to 10.  On additional plays, the resource gathering portion of the game was more fun.  However, the paladin may be a game breaker--both times that I've been "most evil" in phase 1 and phase 2 I've won the game by large margins.  

Both Darquil and A.G. found that combining a resource gathering game with a dungeon monster fighting game made each phase less fun for them.  Darquil actually passed the game on to me in consequence.  Personally though, I really enjoyed the different aspects of the game.

A very, very good game. I had this in my collection for over a year before i got to play it. Don't let it take you that long. The rulebook seems daunting but is actually laid out really well.

Fun for having a two-phase mechanic, resource acquisition worker-placement style, then battle.  Also, the priority and aging of "actions" (3 actions each turn, 2 of which cannot be reused next and are public information) makes for an interesting extra level of planning on which actions you must do before your opponents and which they cannot do.

After only two plays (and with time I may feel otherwise), the game seems marred by many detailed rules that are hard to remember and not often will explained, in an already overly long set of instructions.  For instance, not paying taxes costs damage markers but not paying monsters (same game aspect as taxes) costs reputation for not having food but nothing when the monster costs reputation instead of food and you are out (max evil), but monsters paid for in other monsters and traps cost nothing on payday.  Well, apparently. 

The victory point salad of "titles" for the most tunnels, rooms, imps, etc. seems awkward too as something to strive for.

This is a game about balancing just how 'evil' you are to get the right mix of hero’s to turn up at the end of the year, too evil and the paladin will show up and he's pretty hard core, not evil enough and you can face a party of all rogues making traps useless or all clerics who heal the party after each monster attack.

You need to get a mixed party of adventurers to be able to knock them out, so you have to do evil deeds to jump up the evil track followed quickly be good deeds to drop you back down the track.  
This balancing act combined with the actual creation of your dungeon paradise, creation of imps, hiring of monsters and acquiring of gold make this a fascinating game.

Played one time with 3 players.

MAY 2014: As soon as I saw the board, I knew I was in trouble. Thus far, most of the icon-heavy, cube-pushing Euros have left me cold. After a couple turns, I knew I didn't care for this game, but I got a few rules wrong, and didn't have combat explained to me that thoroughly, AND got blindsided by an event card I didn't know existed...and it was all downhill from there. In a best case scenario, with everything explained perfectly, comfort with the mechanics, etc, this *might* hit 5, but probably a 4.

There simply was nothing about this game I liked: crowded graphic design, overly balanced and like-for-like action spaces, rooms that acted similar to actions spaces. Just same old, same old.

User sisteray used a term called "parallel play engine games". If it means what I think it means: EXACTLY THIS. Overly-balanced acquisition games with one unique mechanic strapped on. See: Myrmes, Industrial Waste, etc.

It is the only game I know where there is a lot of fighting, but we don't fight each other, and yet we don't join in fights either.  The only time the game is interactive is during the placement of minions for resources.  The rest of the time it is more like a game of solitaire.  There is not much you can do to hurt your opponent.  If something bad happens to me it is probably because I did it to myself through poor decisions.

I like the mechanics & strategy of the card play which assigns the resources.  Components are great & the game is attractive.

1/25/11  Played Dungeon Lords. It was fun and I love the theme, but it's right on the border of being too fiddly for me.

Turn the tables on the dungeon crawl theme: Be the dungeon master!  Build your dungeon, dig tunnels, hire monster and set traps but be weary as to be not too evil, lest you attract the most potent heroes who will ask no more than to vanquish your minions swiftly.  Excellent components, hilarious rulebook and truly original setting.  A big winner in our group.  But how will this game age?  We classify it in the "Atmosphere and Experience" category; with the right group, this can be a boat load of fun.  If played too analytically, it's not much of a challenge.  I'm tempted to retire for ever as I slayed the Deluxe Paladin using a Demon on my first game.  It was a grand moment.  Not so shiny anymore after a Dragon, a Green Slime AND a Demon's been at that spiffy armour, hey mr. Paladin?

This had a negative first impression for me.  It felt like a lot of planning that moved along in tiny little steps. Very choppy. Good art and theme but the game lacked anything surprising or exciting. It may just be me, I had a similar reaction to Shogun.  I'd play again but....

At the risk of being a heretic- a die roll somewhere in the  combat would have been refreshing!

So there's a lot to consider while preparing for adventurers but a dungeon lord must do what they have to do. Money was always a problem, there was never enough food, and the neighbors just wouldn't do what I needed them to do. Overall this was fun. We enjoyed stopping the adventurers though we lost more ground than we would have liked with the thieves disarming everything and stopping all the damage, and those nasty wizards sent our golems through a dimensional gate after just one fight. A bit tricky for us, but entertaining to watch them struggle.

Jópofa, egyedi hangulatú téma. Átlagon felüli külcsíny, ami nekem valamiért megse jön be. A játékmenet kicsit bonyodalmasnak tűnt elsőre, de biztos meg lehet szokni. Sokat lehet agyalni a harcon. Az interakció viszont nagyon kevés. Építgetés alatt, csak a szokásos workerplacement kersztebetevés, illetve még az se mivel elég nehéz kitalálni, hogy ki, mit hanyadiknak fog tenni. Harc alatt meg egy teljesen egyszeményel füles rejtvénnyé válik a játék. A kiegészítővel állítólag többet lehet keresztbetenni a másiknak. Szívesen kipróbálnám.

The mark of a fabulous game? When you don't think for a second about VP and winning strategies, but are completely immersed and think the game in thematic terms. How can I get more monsters and traps to defend my dungeons instead of how to make this engine more efficient and get VPs.

The only thing I don't like about it, it doesn't scale well and basically requires you to play with 4 people. But it is well worth it, I love this game.

RATING: 7
Despite the theme, Dungeon Lords is a classic Euro worker placement game. In order to create the most impressive dungeon you hire monsters, dig tunnels, .. and pay your taxes. And at the end of the year, just when you start to get that feeling of accomplishment a band of heroes stumbles down your rabbit hole and tries to turn your precious halls into a pile of rubble.

During the dungeon building phase you can use your imps to collect resources, extend the dungeon, or hire monsters. Each action, however, can only be executed at most three times per turn (in a game with 4 players) so if everybody wants to do the same thing one will leave emty-handed, and depending on when exactly you choose an action the costs and benefits will vary. Of course, action selection is done secretly and simultaneously so there is quite a bit of bluffing and second-guessing involved as well.

Fighting the adventurers off at the end of the year feels more like a puzzle than anything else, trying to optimise your monsters, traps, and other dungeon features to defeat the party as quickly and with as little damage as possible.

So, worker placement, yes, but not simply copying other games, and with its own humourous angle. Beware the paladin!

played it two or three times. The game is fun with good elements. But at some points I would have wished you could play more tactical. If at all places in town the first place/last place would be best you ould try to become first/last by guessing what your opponent will plan. But to try to get the middle place is not really possible.
If you haven't played for some time it is always difficult to get used to all details of the combat again.

Hyped game of the Vlaada "first you build then troubles arrive" trilogy, probably the worst in that serie. Fiddly and too long, maybe the rulebook is fun to read but not so friendly to consult during the game. Unforgiving, and that's a pro, but not as In the Year of the Dragon. Too chaotic for a medium-heavy game.
As usual, an ok game with beautiful components out for Essen with lots of buzz.

Great theme that is incorporated perfectly throughout the game.  The worker placement mechanic used is fresh.  You program your selections before placing the workers and there is a chance that you may not get the exact space you want or that you could waste your action completely.  Oddly reminds me of Agricola in that it's a worker placement that drips with theme, there are a lot of scoring categories to keep track of, and there are 'tax' phases that loom over the proceedings. It's probably no harder to teach or learn than Agricola, to boot.

RATING: 4
Dungeon Lords makes the grave mistake of being complex without being deep.  It is a largely tactical worker placement game with very little interaction (other than checking other peoples position on the evilometer, and groaning when someone slips in ahead of you on a resource space - even this is not overly penalizing).  

The game bogs down with heady computations and number crunching to make sure the best possible trap/monster layout is in line for the upcoming adventurers.  This overly mathematical resolve pulls one away even further from the already loosely veneered theme.

The events just make this difficult for difficult's sake (maybe for a forced laugh - sadistic humor by Vlaada?) feeling more like a write off of actions than an interesting challenge.   

Neither fun or compelling.  Wasted theme and concept.  Insanely long for the amount of decision space.  Too much upkeep, too little game play.

每年最后一季会有英雄来攻打各自的地下城，英雄分不同的等级，恶名最高的玩家要面对等级最高的英雄，和英雄开战类似三国杀，扣血到零就杀死对方，和英雄开战只进行4回合，如果最后依然有英雄存活，则需要按规则拆掉相应的地下室。
感觉这个游戏没多大新意，感觉就是经典的建筑策略游戏+三国杀。

I cannot rate this game yet, because I have only gotten to play it twice.  It seems like it will be a lot of fun when everyone knows what is going on... but getting a group together to sit down for the 45 minutes of time required for the rules explanation alone... before you even begin to play... a 2 hour game... has been impossible.  I host regular game nights, and it has yet to be played there.  It is to the point where one game night the invite will have a sub invite of "who is willing to sit in a room with no distractions for 3 hours to learn this complicated looking game that really isn't complicated?" to guarantee that I get a group interested in playing and to know what they are in for beforehand.  That is a pretty big strike against the game.  If you have four people who know how to play, that obviously isn't an issue, and the game isn't actually that long to play.  But getting to that point...

The board and components are all really really nice and the game is dripping with flavor.  It really seems fun.  Hopefully, one day, I will get to play it with 3 other people who know how to play.

I'm liking this game a lot. It's kind of a blend between Agricola and Galaxy Trucker with a dungeon theme. It has the build up and looks of Agricola with the destruction of Galaxy Trucker. The game can be a bit confusing and a little difficult to learn at first, but with a few plays things start to come around and strategies start to become more apparent.

The game looks great and is a lot of fun to play. I love the theme and it has a good feel to it. There are a lot of things going on and remembering the order of how things get played is key to developing a good strategy. The components are well made and look good. I found gameplay to be around the 2 1/2 to 3 hour time period, once you get the hang of things. It's a tense game right up till the end and scoring is one of my favorite parts of the game. There are many way to score points and earn title at game end which move players score back and forth. Making for an exciting and unknown ending.

Excellent game that I'll play over Agricola any day. I'm VERY happy with this purchase and am in hopes of seeing some expansions for it.

Great game in general. Definitely heavier than Galaxy Trucker or Space Alert, but it's still a lot of good fun.

I've played two and three player games.  Three player was a little better, with more chances to compete over monsters and rooms and to get shut out of actions.

One of our players made some poor mistakes, and was out of the game fairly quickly.  He did not take this well.  This reminded me a bit of Steam, where you have to be pretty cautious or you can set yourself up for some major tragedy very quickly.

However, similar to Galaxy Trucker, if you don't mind the game kicking your butt a bit, it's a great time.

I find this to be one of the most thematic, fun and ever-changing Eurogames I know.

Dungeon Lords is a good game with one nasty flaw.  It's a formidable game to teach to new players.  Going through every detail takes too long, but glossing over the finer points can lead to mass confusion.  Then once you've explained how to play, you'll probably have to suffer one very slow and mistake-filled game while the new players learn the system and the basic strategies.  Once everyone knows the game, it's a lot of fun.  But getting to that point requires some patience.  My current thinking is that the best approach is to give a very cursory overview of the game, then launch right into playing, with the clear understanding that the first play will be a kind of interactive tutorial, "but by the end, you'll understand how everything works."

Dungeon Lords and Galaxy Trucker both have a similar two-phase structure.  First, players piece together their thingamajig (dungeon or spaceship), then they watch as the bad guys try to tear it apart.  Do this three times, and then see who did the best job.  But I don't want to oversell the comparison, because the two games have a totally different feel.  Galaxy Trucker is played in real time, while Dungeon Lords is more methodical.  Personally, I enjoy the frantic real-time building of Galaxy Trucker more than the measured action selection of Dungeon Lords.  However, the tear-down phase of Dungeon Lords is more fun, and involves a lot more decision making.

After reading the rules, I thought Dungeon Lords would be strictly a four-player game.  I was wrong.  While four players is the best configuration, the three-player game is fine.  The dummy player workaround is less of a kludge than I expected.  I've never tried it with two, but the number of reports and photos of two-player games is promising.

RATING: 5
This game missed the mark. The action selection is a lot of fun, and the planning for combat has its interesting parts, but the game just veers way too heavily toward resource gathering. It has Vlaada's signature of not being able to do much on a turn and just feeling overly constrained. It's very surprising that you only fight two parties during the game. In short, I like several of the mechanics a lot, but the design center and use of theme are off.

There are many conflicting thoughts about this game. It seems too complex and too long for a game without that much depth and a theme that suggests that this is a simple game, but the time flies pretty fast when playing the game. The rules are complex, but the theme and the rule book helps and make you remember even pretty obscure rules. Even though the rules are long and dense, it is thorough and funny.

Dungeon Lords is a very good game in which you try to build the best dungeon to trapt as many adventurers before they do damage to your dungeon.  To do so, you build tunnels and rooms, buy trapt and hire monster.

It's a game that is quite complicated to understand and teach before your first play.  It's almost two game in one (with the building phase and the combat phase being so much different)
After a game you realize that it's not so complicated and that the progress board is really well done and make things a lot easier.
I really like the combat mechanic.  It's not a dice rolling type of combat.  There is no radomness during combat, except for the spell cards (but you can see them during the building phase).

In 2012, this befuddled me even though I won. Playing a second time in July 2015, it felt enjoyably flighty and Vlaada-y, with more similarities to Dungeon Petz than I had seen before. (Think of the adventurers as pets...)

RATING: 6
Enjoyed this better than the typical farming/building Euro.  It is still fun to watch your board build up with resources, tunnels, rooms, imps, traps and monsters like other games.  Instead of a simple harvest or feeding phase like similar Euros, everyone has to fend off an attack a little like Kingsburg.  However, unlike KingsBurg, instead of a simple one step pass/fail calculation, there is additional strategy in which traps, monsters you play and in which order you play them.  This is the only significant part of the game that is resolved in turn order, so the game doesn't drag terribly.  As such, worker placement is planned with cards each turn at the same time, so there is no waiting for others.  Also enjoyed trying to second guess other players' placements, as you can benefit yourself more if you place your worker at the right time in the rotation. 

I suspect I can leave a higher rating, if I am able to play again and it retains replayability.  Seems ripe for expansion.

RATING: 7
A convoluted worker placement game that is very much a Vlaada's creation: excessively complex, too long and designed for exactly four players, with scaling down as an afterthought. You first build your dungeon and then struggle to avoid its destruction, reminding me a bit of "Galaxy Trucker". This happens twice in the game, but it might have been better if you could build your dungeon faster and were attacked just once, cutting the playing time in half. I have played it only with two players and it still takes about three hours.

Playing with fewer than four requires the use of dummy players, but at least it gives you a bit more control over the worker placement phase. This can be very chaotic, as you must plan your actions in advance and can be blocked if other players make the same choices. And even if you are not totally blocked, getting the wrong position in an action space (with their different costs and benefits) can still wreck your plans. After four rounds, there is an interesting but complicated combat puzzle where you must account for random card effects.

Despite its flaws, the game is quite enjoyable, definitely helped by its fun theme that puts you in the role of the bad guys. With some streamlining and less randomness, it could have been great.

I'm still not sure about the game.  It's fairly fun, but it has a bit of a learning curve.  I'd like to see it played out some with  no 'new' players.  Unfortunately, the way my gaming group works, it seems like we are always teaching at least one player at the table.

There are a lot of rules there and takes about 20-30 minutes to really teach.  The game itself is easy to understand I think (although I've had a player that just couldn't get it and was forgetting things I taught them).  But, over all I think it's intuitive.  BUT, there is A LOT that NEEDS to get done and only a few actions each turn.  It's very easy not to get done, what you need to do and fall behind.  The game seems to be very 'unforgiving' in that manner.  Because of that I do think that with the learning curve it's hard (not impossible) for 'inexperienced' players to compete.  Which can be frustrating for some.

I find it an interesting game though and wouldn't turn down a game, but I don't find myself craving to play it.

Like dungeon petz, dungeon lords is a great game based on a great theme. The game is a bout heavier than dungeon petz and like most vladaa's deisgn, a bit brutal for newcomers.

Entertaining "Dungeon Keeper" themed game. The many icons and symbols may seem overwhelming at first, but the rules are really not that complicated, once you've played a few turns. The worker placement mechanics work really well here.
As the risk of facing insurmountable odds are definitely present, play the game with a light heart and you'll have a nice time.
I do think that it takes too long for what it is, and going through the exact same phases once more after facing the heroes the first time seems a bit anticlimactic. I'd have preferred to build up to one huge combat sequence at the end of the game.

Best ratio of fun+strategy per playing time I've ever encountered. If you switch of the emotional filter and look critically at the game itself, then you see mechanics that are derivative of old games, or even worse - YAWPG (Yet Another Worker Placement Game). But once you switch the human mode back on, you can't help but realize that's it's not a clock, it's a Rolex! It's cute and lighthearted and deliciously evil and has excellent stories attached to every little rule, which makes it fun to learn. The rulebook itself is a work of art!

This one takes a brutally long time to learn the first game, and still runs kind of long once you know how to play.

The theme is excellent and a welcome change from most worker placement games, and the components are lovely.

Looks cutesy but is very deep and vicious. Oftentimes a single misstep can cost you very, very dearly (if a magic spell ruins your defenses or an event causes you to be unable to pay taxes, for example) and that can be very frustrating in a game as long as this. Generally is highly intricate and entertaining though.

My score for this used to be a 9, it has dropped a little since the playtime for it doesn't seem to have decreased even with more plays.

Needs some getting into for full gaming pleasure. The two different phases (worker placement with outwitting opponents, then a puzzle where you try to defeat the invading heroes, repeat both for the second year) with the tons of interactions between them through the evil-o-meter, coupled with indirect but very important interaction between the players, and the good integration of the theme, help the game towards greatness.

When reading the Stone Age rules, by the way, I was reminded of Dungeon Lords. It's kinda like Stone Age is the first phase of a year in Dungeon Lords, stripped of the outwitting component and with some more obvious competition added instead.

I liked this game quite a bit despite the long time it takes to learn.  Once it clicks though, it does flow quite smoothly.  I had a lot of fun my first play until the scoring came in.  It feels like the game would be less fun if I just focused on maximizing points, and the theme would diminish from a dungeon defending game to an efficiency type game.

I also don't like how the computer player in a 3-player game works.  It's so random that it can be hard to judge when to play certain action cards.  I screwed myself out of a critical card due to this and while I could have tried to foresee the computer playing that card before me, there was no way to know.  I think this would be remedied in a 4-player game where you can at least try to analyze what the other players might do at what times and ignore the complete arbitrary randomness.

I'd like to rate this higher as I do really like the theme and the gameplay once you learn it, but the scoring system seems to contradict building a big dungeon with big baddies and traps.  A small, efficient dungeon which was rewarded for having the least destruction and most assets ended up winning.  I'll have to play it again and see how strongly the scoring factors into my enjoyment, but it really bothered me after the game.  Unfortunate because I liked everything else!

I've read that one's initial impressions of a game are not only based on the game itself, but within the context of how it was presented/taught and what the outcome was for the player in question. I agree.

My first and last experience of this game is based on that. The rules were glossed over with what I thought was a poor explanation, and there was really no context given as to what I should be doing to do well at this game. Some questions were rebuffed by "don't worry about that for this game" and the like. Clearly, there were a bunch of rules that were too complicated to go over for this introductory session, but in the end, I felt like I was abandoned to fend for myself resulting in a ridiculously negative score. Yes, the gaming session was one of the worst I had ever experienced, so much so that I thought about quitting the hobby altogether.

So, what about the game? On the surface, it seems to have a blend of novel mechanics. The worker placement coupled with the limited action-card selection is neat: there is a limited queue where action-cards are loaded, and these are executed in turn-order to determine how the workers are placed. An action you take now will not be available the next turn, unless you queue it in under specific conditions. Layout of the dungeon tiles seems neat at first, but quickly becomes a dry affair--you're trying to set up your dungeon to "defend" against the human adventurers, but how they wander through the dungeon is based on strict rules; so you are not arranging them to form like an adventure, but setting up layers of defense, as they will destroy one or several rooms per turn. There is a unique "evilness" meter that measures how dastardly you are being, which allows collection of more resources and what not. It is very similar to collecting corruption in Cleopatra, waking up your apprentices too early in Fresco, or Forced Labor in Antiquity; you'll get more done, but if your evilness reaches the bottom of the track, this attracts the most powerful human adventurer known as the Paladin--and he'll do pretty serious damage to your dungeon, so you don't want your evilness to get out of hand. There is a need to balance food production and worker production, and trying to expand your dungeon, while keeping everyone fed is punitive and annoying. The most annoying aspect of the game is how the human adventurers are handled as they descend into your dungeon. It is based on a linear series of conditionals, starting with traps and poisons, monsters, and ending with magic, which feels more like a process flow-chart and puzzle-solving than it feels like running a dungeon. If some of the humans survive through this gauntlet (and combat is simplified, like in Arkham Horror), then they do some damage to your dungeon.

All in all, nice components and visually appealing. However, the gameplay is clunky, unintuitive, punitive, and linear. I had imagined that this game would recapture the feel of being a dungeon master back in my RPG days, but it is not. It is more about the administrative aspects of building/expanding/maintaining your dungeon--all not fun. And those pesky humans are always trying to mess it up. If it were not for the horrible experience I had the first time, I may be inclined to give this a '5' as there is probably a game in there somewhere. However, with the latent, abysmal feel of the game, coupled with a bad experience, I know I will never play this again, and hence my '2'.

Call me an Essen zombie. Liked Galaxy Trucker a lot. This one is good fun basically because it works very hard to be fun - the graphics, the rulebook, the general sense of 'play' it evokes, because otherwise it's a worker placement abstract and could be more or less anything. It isn't though: it's full of fun dungeony goodness.

One of the better programmed action games with a novel 'dungeon exploring in reverse' theme. There's a strange inverse snowball effect at work: by remaining virtuous you attract the wimpier adventurers to your domain and then you need to spend fewer resources on traps and monsters to keep them out. This leads me to suspect that there's less replay value here than meets the eye. I won my first game of this quite comfortably against more experienced opponents and that's always a danger sign in my book. I enjoyed it and I'll play again, but this may lose its shine after a few plays.

Seems like a tight resource management/worker placement Euro but there's a lot more to it that keeps you interested. Don't like the scoring system where you score points in lots of different categories. It's ok but a bit much like work.

Can't argue with the production quality, and of course the theme is very appealing.  This is a programming game, kind of like Shogun, but with a worker-placement cast to it, which in practice means it's pretty easy to think things out carefully and still find yourself thwarted.  Once you resign yourself to that, it is pretty fun to build up the various parts of your dungeon and plan out your fights with the adventurers.  The fights go on different lengths of time for different players, which can create more downtime.  

I'd like to try the advanced game.  For me, this is a good once-in-a-while change of pace game. (3 plays)

This is what Agricola claims to be. It's a brutal worker placement game where you get really involved in the actual construction of your dungeon. The combat "puzzles" are less brain burning than a lot would have you believe. This is my favorite Euro.

Too little interaction for my taste. In the first phase 
you compete with other players to get resources which you need to solve a solo puzzle in the second phase. Neither phase satisfies me. Great implementation of theme though.

Much different than I had anticipated. When I saw the box art and the humor on the back I thought that this game would by much lighter than it truly is. For all you brain burners this is the title that you want to pick up. It does have very little player interaction other than trying to get the paladin to go elsewhere but I enjoyed it. The only disappointing part for me is the abstraction of the traps, I thought I was going to get to set up rooms in a way to create a tactical reason for traps to be set in a certain manner when in reality it's just a card that you get to play from your stack for which ever room is currently being attacked. None the less, a very fun game and I can see it hitting the table more.

Played this for the first time at TABscon. A bit more complex than the games I'm used to, and it will likely take at least another play or two for me to fully grasp all the strategy, but I LOVED IT. I used to play D&D a lot in my university days, and I got a real kick out of playing for the evil side.

Many thanks to Abby (GamesCafeChick on TABS) for teaching the game to us.

I want to own this game, and I want to play this game many more times.

Being a Dungeon Administrator is a real pain in the ass.  First, there is the careful management and distribution of resources such as gold, food and imps, the artful methods of hiring monsters and spying on the fighters guild, and the careful crafting of dungeon corridors, rooms and traps.
Then once you have everything meticulously planed out, a group of heroes comes through and destroys everything you worked so hard to build.
Despite the frustration of watching your dungeon waste away to ruins, this is actually a really fun game.

Alot of pieces and a busy board to set up so that takes about 5 minutes or so. The game pretty much runs itself with the season track so that was easy to understand.

Great mix of adventure game and strategy.

Overrated.  Great theme, great components, good mechanics, but this game is multiplayer solitaire at its worst.  

In addition to the fact that the only interaction is in blocking other players' worker placements (which many games can pull off successfully), Dungeon Lords also incorporates drawn-out, individual "puzzle" sequences.  The problem?  Watching the other players solve their puzzles is terribly dull.

There is some interesting novelty here.  I don't think the comparisons to Galaxy Trucker are fair.  It is a bit more like the angst you get from playing Year of the Dragon.  You know what's coming.  You know it could hurt, but you can only protect against so many of your problems at the same time.  Still a touch long, and has more of the feel of an experience game, though its mechanics are classically Euro.  All of this left me wondering whether or not I need to own it.

Neat puzzles. The worker-placement incentives boggle me (I want the thing that everybody else wants, but I want to make sure I ask for it last...but NOT after 3 people have asked for it). Too prone to AP, especially in the fights, especially when you're JUST ONE POINT of damage away from saving part of your dungeon.

There is just something about this game that befuddles me. I can't seem to do well at it. It wants something from me that I apparently cannot give!

A fantasy type game that involves fighting off monsters using hit points and health points. This idea works best in  an RPG video game and yet this board game makes it work in cardboard ... not a small feat. I particularly enjoy playing this game in teams of two x 3 or 4 players. Visually beautiful ... if you're looking for a good "hit points" fantasy game ... this is it!

Heavy gamer's game.  Don't be mislead by tons of climate - this is a demanding game.
  Those who claim luck plays too big role for such a complex game are dead wrong.  There are ways to handle it and the best (not the luckiest) player always wins in the final account.

At the same time it's extremely innovative and refreshing game.  Two thumbs up!

EDIT: 3-player mode is perfectly fine.  No need to be reluctant to try it.

RATING: 10
Competitive worker placement leading up to a sequence where you defend your property from attack. Also difficult in that a score of "0" is considered "winning" as far as the game is concerned. Pleasant to look at, challenging to play, has the unfortunate side effect of scaring off anyone not instantly committed.

RATING: 8
GT is on the line for me, SA was an instant buy (co-op randomness in a 10 minute game I can handle especially if its fun). 

Will be playing this with hopes of buying but it might be too random for 2 hours multiplayer like GT was

Vlaada give us a GAMERS GAME with no randomness! .....Please?  Pretty please?  


[u]UPDATE:[/u]  Okay as you can see from my pre-playing comments above, luck was the biggest concern for me. I've only played once but I think the level is close to okay, maybe a little more than I might like but ah hell, maybe I am being a little soft due to the great theme but its not that bad really. 

Well themed and intergrated as usual for Vlaada and beautifully produced as well as we can also except from this great company. Take some crisis management and mix in slightly overblown resource management, use the GT platform (build to be destroyed) and reduce the randomness somewhat and you have DL, sort of. Programmed actions drive your game and you can get slightly burned here but if you are paying attention to the others you normally wont, good planning pays off too.  

Though the rule explaination was involved and long the game flowed very well and flew by for our group, first game was only 2 hours, I suspect that could be brought down to 90 minutes with a fast group, might stay at 2 for an average group. I see people saying deep and I see people saying fiddly, we never found it that fiddly really and not really deep either, some but it is good and meaty at any rate. Planning is necessary for sure but you wont know all the perils coming your way so you just do your best, has that Euro game quality where you need everything and wont get it. 

I think I would say just as a summary statement if you want a much meatier and somewhat less random game than Galaxy Trucker (no tile grab to build however) in around 2 hours, you shouldn't be disappointed. A bit of a fine line here but that is exactly what I expected and overall I enjoyed it in my one play and I could see 4 more for sure. As you might expect the fun level is somewhat lower (IMO) since this is more of a serious game, but so is the luck so that is the trade-off. Luck stung me a couple of times but it got the others too and the effects weren't too big, so far I'm okay with it but between a group of competitive serious gamers (my normal group which this first game was not with) you/I might think its a little high, I'll need to play again to judge it for certain. Of course liking the theme will help for those into Fantasy or Dungeons, I never played the PC game Dungeonkeeper to my memory but I am a dungeon crawler so it probably won an extra point here from me though I try to refrain from those things in my ratings. Non-fantasy guys, well, just another resource management game, maybe, but still a good one I think. Expectations and your like of the theme will put this between a 6 - 8 for a pretty big group of people.

RATING: 6
Reasonably fun game, but it reminds me a bit of Agricola in that it's a game where the problem in front of your face (adventurers trying to break into your home and vandalize it/steal your stuff) isn't actually how you score points/win the game, so it feels sort of pulled in two directions in a forced/clunky way. You have to be able to take care of the adventurers or you'll lose a bunch of points, but really you have to get to a point where you can beat them quickly so you can spend the rest of your time focusing on the arbitrary scoring categories that feel completely tacked on. In my game at some point about half way through year two I realized I'd be able to beat all of my adventurers this round with probably the loss of one tunnel and nothing else, and at that point I realized there was nothing else I even wanted to do. I looked at the scoring card and decided I didn't care at all about achieving any of these things so I bought another monster I didn't even use in the final fight, because it seemed like as an evil villain in control of a dungeon I'd want as many monsters as possible. I forget what I did with my extra actions, I think in the last round I bought an imp that I didn't need because I didn't have enough rooms to use him in. Is it my fault or the game's that I found myself not caring at all about the scoring? This seems to happen a lot with this designer's games for me, but rarely for any other games. In fact my favorite games are all low theme vp optimization euros.

Combination worker placement and puzzle solving.  The initial worker placement results in some interesting strategies, vying against the other players for choice monsters and so forth to defend your lair.  The fights against the two character parties is like a complicated puzzle, trying to figure out the exact best sequence with which to deploy your monsters and traps (no dice rolling involved).  It's a fun, challenging game with an amusing theme.  My main reservation is that when one is building the dungeon itself, it is purely an optimization challenge which has little impact on the character parties.  I would have preferred more of s sense of setting up a death trap for the pesky humans.

RATING: 8
I love Vlaada's designs.  Maybe this is just my bias showing, but this is probably the best "thinky" worker placement game I've ever played.

The rules are a butt-whip, though, and if you're coming back to this game after a four month hiatus or so, you ARE going to mess something up.  And it's frustrating to teach, especially for the "learn by doing" crowd.  Those administrative headaches make it an 8 instead of a 9.

Given how much I like this and Power Grid, maybe I need to try more games that tend to get dinged for being "too fiddly."

I've never been able to the hang of the role selection decisions in this game.  They have what Valerie Putman calls "the Princess Bride problem" because "I can clearly not choose the card...."  You can only go so far in second-guessing what your opponents will select, so you just have to go with your first instinct (or maybe your second) and live with the consequences.  The problem is, I never managed to develop good instincts as to which roles to select.  The game is amusing, but not enough for me to want to fight through the learning curve.

This is the first game (in 143) I've rated below a 3, and I won't be playing it again.

Do you like fighting the game?  Do you like being denied the actions you need to fight the game due to turn order or because another player is selecting sub-optimally?  Do you like being forced into a specific version of an action that's entirely dependent on the order in which your card came up with cycling player order that changes every turn?  Do you like waiting for a tile to come out of a stack only to discover that turn order prevents you from having a chance at getting it?  

If so, this game is for you, and we shouldn't play games together.

Feels like it takes nearly as long to teach as to play, but I feel like once everyone knows it, it'll go by very quickly.  It has a great theme and simultaneous action selection is something that makes me like these sorts of dry mechanics (worker placement) a lot more.

Be the boss of your very own dungeon.  Not quite as sadistic (or adult themed) as the computer Dungeon Keeper game it is based on, but still fun to build and defend your hole in the ground.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (September 2010)

The first Vlaada game I played (I believe) and it IS a great game.

I know the rules are hard to understand at first (if you only read the hilarious rulebook) but if you show one turn of play using the great boardgame graphic design as a teaching aid, it is very easy and intuitive to play.

I love the theme and worker placement actions are very tight in this game (as you only get 3 actions per turn), perhaps my only misgiving is that the score system is not clearly related to what you are doing in the game, this has allowed me to win games even though I have the most conquered dungeon. 

Dungeon Lords is complex enough that it pleases my inner gamer, but it is also lots of fun, the fight against justice is really cool to watch and it is very funny to see how the heroes destroy your opponents´ dungeons.

Bottom line, Dungeon Lords is a game I want to own and one I will explore further in the near future.

With some many games clamoring attention, I haven’t played Dungeon Lords as much as I wanted to, so it’s been a long time since I last played it :(, however I still regard it as a great game and I won’t say no to a play of Dungeon Lords when the opportunity arise. 

For now, I still think this is still better than its thematic descendant Dungeon Petz, but both games are very good in my book (Dungeon Petz also made my 2011 top ten favorite games list).

In Dungeon Lords, the theme oozes everywhere and that’s weird and exciting to have in an euro game. The game is very tight with lots of hard/interesting decisions to make every turn.

On the bad side (for some), it can be a bit harder to teach as it has many rules, also its play time can be on the long side (but that doesn’t bother me).

In conclusion, Dungeon Lords is a great game that I want to play often. It is also the game who opened my eyes toward one of the best game designers out there (perhaps my favorite). To this day, I will buy anything Vlaada puts out with my eyes closed.

After even more plays, I find the game doesn’t take that long to play. When all the players are familiar with it, it moves at a fast pace. The setup/teardown can be a bit involved but I don’t mind much about that.

Very good game.

Expectations were sky-high for Dungeon Lords.  And it mostly delivers.  Mostly.

Worker placement's been done to death but mostly as a queue, not a stack.  I like that latecomers get better versions of the actions.  The simultaneous action selection in DL doesn't exactly seem like worker placement to me.  Which is fine - the world doesn't really need a fantasy-themed Caylus.

The combat is engaging.  The game flow is complex at first but not actually that difficult to assimilate.

Obviously theme is not going to be an issue.

I think the reason why I only like, not love, Dungeon Lords is that the resources are very tight, which probably makes the game better mechanically but creates thematic dissonance for me.  I rule a dungeon and I can't scrape together enough food to feed my troll?  Running a dungeon feels a lot like running a business.  Perhaps that's realistic but realism doesn't appear to be the object here.

In the end I'm not sure I have more than 7-10 plays of Dungeon Lords in me over the next year or two.  If I have more it will be on the strength of the theme.  Still worth the purchase, as this will be a fun game to bring back out when my son is older.

My initial reaction is the same after playing my first game as it was after reading the rules - it's too long and meaty of a game for the worker placement to be as random as it is.  IMO, to be a gamer's game, the choosing three order placements at once then revealing is too punishing.  Choosing one at a time would allow greater control of your dungeon.  This isn't Galaxy Trucker where most of the fun is watching ships blown to smithereens.

With that said, the theme, cartoon artwork and instructions are very, very fun!

While still nowhere near my top 5 of worker placements, additional plays have allowed me to appreciate the gameplay and non-control more.  There is actually quite a bit of manipulation possible with the evilometer and role selections that makes quite a nice change of place in the worker placement genre.

I was a little nervous about buying this one.  I was looking for a brain-burner, but some of the reviews (such as the Dice Tower's) had been mixed.  We've attempted two two-player games so far, and I'm _really_ enjoying it.  It feels very similar to Agricola in its first plays: so much to do, so little time, what to focus on, etc. . . . with the added element of jockeying for position and the combat puzzles.  Very nice game.

(Update after most recent play).  Fabulous game-- I snuck out a victory over the year 2 paladin with a very timely anti-magic dart and a hardy team of year 1 monsters, after my golem got zapped by a magic spell in the first combat phase.  And still lost.

If it were a little shorter, with a little less down-time, I would probably rate it a 10 right now.

Another update- not getting played much due to complexity, rating is sitting around a seven.

Equip your dungeon through the year until it's adventuring season. Then see how many hapless warriors you can catch with your trap. It's a reverse D&D mechanic that really has a lot of possibilities, involves strategy, and encourages fun (so long as someone's not being a wussy puppy-kicker).

BIG PLUS: sense of fun, options available
BIG MINUS: playing time is lonnnnnng, you're not really playing against others

RATING: 7
Be a Dungeon Lord, in the game Dungeon Lords, lording it up and building dungeons! The game appears to be inspired by the old computer game, Dungeon Keeper, a real-time strategy game where players used little minions to gather resources, build rooms and halls, and attract the best monsters to move in. Eventually adventurers would come around and start knocking heads and as master of the dungeon, your job was to stop them. Exact same idea here.

The game has a simple structure: you spend 4 turns building your dungeon, then you fend off invading adventurers with traps and monsters, then you spend 4 more turns building your dungeon, then you again fend off an adventuring party, and the game ends. The game is difficult to teach because you pretty much have to learn it backwards. You have no idea what to build into your dungeon until you know what happens when the adventurers arrive. They tried to make the rulebook follow this structure: teach combat, then describe the rules to the game, then describe combat again. It makes the rules a bit long and cumbersome and I had difficulty getting through them with all the jumping around. It reads like more of a training manual than a rulebook and I struggled with the non-linear nature of it. I just don't have much patience with all that hand-holding. But there is excellent dungeon humor sprinkled throughout. Funniest rulebook I've ever read.

Each player has their own personal dungeon board with a grid to put hallways and rooms, places to store food, gold, traps and monsters, and room for the adventurers to start lining up (as you build your dungeon you start to get some clues as to the kinds of characters you will meet). There is also a central board which shows the monsters and rooms available for that turn as well as the menu of actions you can take. The game is described as "worker-placement", but that isn't very accurate. There are 8 possible actions to take. Each action can be taken by up to 3 players, but the action will be slightly different depending on if you take it 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. Each player has a hand of 8 order cards corresponding to the 8 actions. 2 actions are unavailable each turn, so with the remaining 6 actions, players blind bid cards into 3 slots. After bidding, players reveal their 1st card and claim actions in player order, then they do the same with the 2nd and 3rd orders. This is where the meat of the game primarily lies. I typically don't care for blind bidding, but here it works well. There are lots of considerations in play. While there is definitely some uncertainty, it does not overwhelm the game. The only aspect of this that at all resembles "worker placement" is that if a 4th player seeks to perform an action, they are out of luck and lose the action. This only happened a couple of times in our game, but in a game with so few actions overall, it can be devastating.

The eight actions to build your dungeon are the heart of the game. Understand them and you are 90% there.

Adventurers come in standard types - Fighters always go in front, Thieves reduce damage from traps, Clerics heal, and Wizards can cast spells (randomly drawn). Three adventurers (plus possibly a powerful paladin if you are the evilest of all!) invade, conquering one room at a time. You assign a trap and monster each round. If there are any surviving party members, then they conquer the room and move on to the next. They stop when all are defeated or 4 rounds are up, which ever comes first. Conquered rooms are minus points at game's end and they lose all special powers. The scoring system rewards a balanced development strategy.

The game definitely has a ton of character and it is a pretty astounding design accomplishment. However, it is also very cumbersome to set up and even more cumbersome to teach. I don't mind these things usually, but a part of me wonders if this game is really worth all of the work. The game isn't long enough to build up a really impressive dungeon and most of the actions come in dribs and drabs. This was designed by Vlaada Chvatil, who also designed Galaxy Trucker, and there are definitely some similarities in the "build-it then watch it get destroyed" style of these games. In GT, it feels like you build more, adventure more, and generally have more fun in a shorter time frame. Dungeon Lords certainly has more strategy than GT, but it is also MUCH slower paced. I also think that losing an action by being the 4th player to choose it may be a bit too punishing. It's a good game though, pretty unique, and one I'd be happy to play again.

Well, I like this better than Galaxy Trucker. Unfortunately, I find Dungeon Lords way more complex for the amount of fun I derived from it. There is a lot to keep track of. Fortunately, the iconography is most helpful.

The first half of the game is a little like Agricola in the sense that you are building up your engine. Worker/minion placement is determined by simultaneous reveal of actions. I found that interesting. Second spot is usually the most desirable.

The second half is the tear down phase, where heroes attack your dungeon. There is a puzzle element. You are trying to find the best combo of trap and monster to thwart the incoming party.

Like Agricola, I am mentally exhausted by the end. With Dungeon Lords, I am just happy to survive the ordeal and could care less about victory points. Yes, in my first game I scored less than zero and came in last. Mind you, I was playing against 3 other players with PhDs.

Vlaada, you impressed me again.

RATING: 6

Dungeon Lords is a passable game that I can more or less dismiss in one sentence: way too much of way too little.

To wit: you will never earn much gold, collect much food, build many rooms, hire many imps, dig many tunnels, set many traps, recruit many monsters, fight off many adventurers, become all that evil, take many actions, or score many points. You will do all of these things, and it will take a while, but in the end it's a game with a large number of moving parts that creak once or twice before it's all over.

Everything rides on Vlaada Chvatil's trademark implementation of theme. The rulebook is laugh-out-loud hilarious, and that humor comes through in small doses during the game. It's certainly amusing to lure a Paladin into the countryside with your evil deeds, only to switch over to your best behavior so that the Paladin changes course and wrecks another player's dungeon instead of yours. But overall I can't see this game growing on me. It's quite procedural. The core mechanism of the game is simultaneous action selection crossed with turn-order resolution. So like Race for the Galaxy or Goldbrau, you have have to guess what other players are doing in order to maximize your own turn. I'm not a big fan of that in general.

After one play I feel like I've seen everything there is to see here. The differences that crop up from session to session may be enough for some players but for me I suspect they will be trivial. Dungeon Lords is a game of breadth, not depth.

Final note: there is no worker placement in this game. At all. Just as there is no deduction in Tobago. Someone get me a "mechanics police" microbadge, stat.

You play the head of the dungeon instead of the adventurer. It's nice that it adds the Euro flavor to a dungeon themed game. Essentially it is worker placement to select options like building or getting money, food, monsters, or traps. There is a second worker placement element as you multiply the number of imp followers. Then select your traps and monsters to fight off the adventurers. It's a fun game.

Update after several plays: I've developed a fondness for how tight the game plays and how much every player action matters. It certainly plays quicker with experienced players. This is great stuff that begins to shine with repeated plays. 


I more-or-less enjoyed this the one time I played it, but question how badly I ever need to go back and play again. I really like the concept and theme and all of the D&Dish chrome. But... the investment in game length offers poor return in terms of dungeon size, horde size and collections of traps. Don't get me wrong; I love a game that forces you to choose a strategy and suffer for what you DIDN'T do, but I would be so much more satisfied if I could simulate lots more of these cool dungeon-y things in a quicker game play format.

Holy hell this game is difficult. I found it tougher than any game of Agricola. Good choices aren't apparent. It's easy to set yourself up for failure. I even had a turn where it effectively net me a loss. Lots of things to pay attention to. We were heeding the 2-player warning for "first time players", so we played a 3rd player, as a mock/dummy player. We just played random cards, and made our own rules for when and how to make choices.. The dummy player won by 5 points. He stayed low, got easy adventures, and cleaned them up pretty well.

Yet, none of it seemed unfair. I made bad choices and the game absolutely hammered me for it. It is an unforgiving game.

I heard the game was finicky, and I don't agree. While, as I said, there's a lot to pay attention to it isn't too complex or obfuscated by confusing iconography or obscure actions. 7 Wonders is more finicky than this.

The art is fantastic. The rule book is stellar (Though a little bit was difficult to reference.)

One of the finest games I've played. I had so much fun with this game. I can't wait to play it again.

I was really pumped up about Dungeon Lords based on the theme and
the designer. Then I read the rules, and found out that it was a
game of blind action selection with only a tiny bit of information
about what others might do (the two cards they can't select), and
ridiculous amounts of fiddly chrome added on the side.

And the games I observed others play early on didn't encourage
me to try it either: the games took ridiculously long, some players
were completely out of the game very early on, and the reports were
that the battle system was nowhere near as interesting in practice
as the training puzzles suggested. I did eventually try it out a
couple of times, but it just felt very random and was far from
having enough meat on the bones for such a long game.

If there's one game whose apparent popularity I really boggle at,
it's DL.

An excellent game. Create a dungeon and kill the adventurers before they destroy your dungeon. Play cards to allow you to place your minions to buy traps, rooms, monsters, or allow your imps to dig for gold or tunnel for more dungeon space. Keep your evil down if you dont want to attract the tough paladin. I cant say enough good things about this game. It is best played with 4 players. I dont think it would be as good without 4 players.

RATING: 7
Dungeon Lords would not be a natural favorite for me, mainly due to the uninspiring theme, which I know is a big selling point for many.  But Dungeon Lords feels different enough from most fantasy-themed games and presents a lot of challenges in what is really much more of a euro design than you would think.

My main problem is with lack of experience with the game.  There are a lot of rules to digest, and you really have to play the game quite a few times to fully appreciate it (at least that's what I think).  I fear that I may have a lot of trouble getting this to the table enough to make it pay off.

Le thème m'attire, mais il a des aspects intéressants au-delà du thème. Je le vois un peu comme un Galaxy trucker moins free-for-all. Tu dois construire quelque chose (un vaisseau spatial vs un donjon), puis ton quelque chose doit survivre au hasard (cartes dans GT et aventuriers dans DL). Sauf que dans Galaxy trucker c'est de la vitesse et un peu de n'importe quoi pour faire le vaisseau, alors que dans DL c'est une construction stratégique. Aussi, pour la partie de subir les événements, dans GT tu ne peux que subir les cartes comme elles arrivent, dans DL il y a un petit côté "casse-tête". Tu as une série de monstre et une série d'aventuriers et tu dois planifier comment le plus optimalement tu peux utiliser les monstres pour limiter l'effet des aventuriers. De plus, il est très joli, il y a des règles un peu détaillées mais TOUT est sur le board, pas besoin de se souvenir de détails. (11-2009)

In a game of this length and depth, this amount of chaos is too much for me. The order of the actions is so paramount, and can be screwed up so badly with such terrible repercussions, that I don't want to play this again. Which sucks, because I'm in love with the theme.

One of my favorite worker placement games.  Plays much better with more players with the thrill of getting nothing from a space making every decision tense.  There are so many things to keep an eye on that it is impossible to do everything you want/need to do and ultimately some things are going to go wrong.  I enjoy the contrast in the initial phases with the battle phase and enjoy both immensely.  Another great design by my favorite game designer.

Well, the graphics are great, but I don't really see this one as being up to Vlaada's par.  It's very fiddly and the theme is only really well represented during the least involved part, the battle phase, where each player just plays solo against their own group of adventurers.  The bulk of the game is a role selection/worker placement mechanic with a little guess what your neighbor is doing thrown in for randomness.  The game is not very interactive.  I'm sure it will maintain it's high ranking on this site because it is decent for a complicated game and many BGG'ers love having a bunch of elements married together in a balanced way.

Quite enjoyed this one. Even for a first play, things just seemed to click for me. I love the theme--reminds me of those great PC game classics Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 (though a lot more PG, of course), and it plays a lot more smoothly than all the rules and elements may suggest.

My only complaints are that it does take a while to get through a game (I would say 2 to 2.5 hours?) and while I'm never one to balk at long games (BSG still remains a favourite), the amount of enjoyment isn't as high. It might have to do with how little player interaction there is, but this is a fun game nonetheless if you have people willing to go through it with ya.

My favourite Euro without question.  I love the punishing difficulty.  I love the tension while you wait for people to reveal and see if you're completely fucked.  I love the artwork, the plastic imps, and everything else about this game

I rather like the combination of mechanics in this game -- the simultaneous action selection and the resultant impact on the cost of those actions, the puzzle-like aspect of deciding how to defend against the various adventurers invading your dungeon, the cute little imp figures. Don't know why, but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts for me,

"Excellent !" dirait Mister Burns. Et moi aussi, le coup de foudre, j'y joue autant que possible, une dizaine de parties par an suffit à mon bonheur. Une exceptionnelle adaptation de jeux vidéo en jeu de société, avec des méchaniques que j'adore : placement d'ouvriers, tenter d'anticiper les coups des autres joueurs, gestion et construction, puzzle game pour résoudre les combats. Et avec l'extension c'est encore bien meilleur et plus immersif, le jeu a l'air vraiment vivant, énorme rejouabilité.

Good worker placement game. Sure the designer added flavor and theme to those eurogames styles that only comes with wood cubes and bad artwork boards. 

The mechanic is a little strange, but if you have ever played dungeon Keeper on PC, you will love it!

It is an euro, but flavored!

Very funny game...
I like the theme and it has some very good mechanics. Dungeon Crawler fans should pay attention: This is NOT your standard dungeon crawler where you run through mazes, roll a lot of dices and kill something. This one is more a worker placement game and the battle system is more of a puzzle. I think, this is why I like it so much: It's different (in a good way!).

I believe this os maybe the best game from Vlaada. It has nice concept based un Dungeon Keeper, beautiful artwork and components, worker placement mechanic and quite steep learning curve. The competitivness is not mean, you can not destroy the game for others much. The only issue I have with the game is the victory point system. Basically, you do not know who is winning until the game is over.

Very thematic game, reminiscent of the video game Dungeon Keeper, with lots of indirect interactions (deduction). Much better when played with the item variant. Can have replayability issues after multiple plays, but these are solved with the expansion Festival Season, which makes the game much more unforgiving.

a very innovative game. the rules are so clever, quite complex though. DL actually feels like several mini-games combined into a larger engine. everything meshes together perfectly but the interactions are complicated and you have to be really concentrated to see the big picture. a rather difficult game to learn. if there was a separate score for theme and artwork dungeon lords would get a 10. if i were to judge the rulebook - it's an 11!

Dungeon Lords is a good game.  However I will tell you that it has a steeper learning curve than some other resource management games.

I must just not be a fan of Chvátil's "shortage games" as this one feels to me much like galaxy trucker.  You build up something neat (but never as cool as you would like to make it, because everyone else is interfering) and then the game completely smashes it. I would rather play a game where I can win the most rather than lose the least, but that's how Dungeon Lords feels. Even if you come out ahead, it just means you've been beaten around a little less than everyone else. Not too edifying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Game with full of unique ideas. As usual within these Czech games Dungeon Lords is full of small pieces AND (as usual) there are too much small different details and things to remember. Because of these, the game is 1) it's far from elegant design  2) hard to explain OR at least it takes a lot of time. But, the game itself works and it's fun to play. A good game, but it doesn't shine in a same way than Galaxy Trucker does.

Played once, 4 players.  Is this game good?  Yes.  Is it great?  No.  There are 2 main reasons why I can't rate this game higher. 1) Fiddly as hell.  There are a ton of little things to keep track of, and bits, and stacks for different phases of the game, etc.  I got lost.  2) One too many random mechanics.  The monsters are random; the heroes are random; the traps are random; the spells are random; the rooms are random.  There are mechanics in place to allow some control over these random parts, but I felt almost overwhelmed with uncertainty/unclarity.  I doubt I'll be asking to play again, but I won't sit pouting if this is the only game being played either.

The very fun theme makes this very a requested game in my circle.  It has the merit of wrapping actually quite rich worker placement and resource management in a classic fantasy setting which makes it easy to like and understand.  On the downside, this feels like it's going to get old rather fast, with limited avenues to victory and not much variety.

RATING: 8
My best game of 2009. It is easy to somehow relate this with Agricola, since the main part of the game involves work placement. Despite this, DL work placement selection occurs simultaneously, with players having some info about opponents options (each player has 2 unavailable orders every turn, and this is public knowledgment). These changes obviously imply two things: first, you need to try to guess what your opponents will do -taking into account their needs- and act accordingly. Second, it adds some randomness to the game (your efforts of guessing may be totally useless, and some unexpected move can end up punnishing you to great extents). For me, DL mechanics work better than Agricola ones, although this is, of course, a matter of taste.

The building phase also alows you to interact with the only really original mechanic of the game: the evilometre. This shows the evilness of every player, and can be altered via lots of different ways (hiring some monsters, spreading rumours about you...). It plays a very important role in the game, since it is used to select the adventurers that will attack each player and if someone will face also the frightenning Paladin.

Finally, the second phase of the game, when you "use" your monsters, traps and rooms to fight the adventurers trying to destroy you carefully built dungeon, is for me a great addition. This phase is not deep, since the meat of the game is the building phase, but it is really rewarding: In DL you build a dungeon, and then you use it and (hopefully) show everyone how well constructed it is. Compare this with Agricola, when you build a farm and then, well, the game ends.

All in all, DL is a very solid game that confirms Vlaada as my favourite game designer. Fun and original (the last one due to the evilometre), it may be not as outstanding as Space Alert but, well, since SA is my favourite game overall, I guess this is not a huge drawback. Highly recommendable.

I think I want to love this game more than I actually do.  This is very much a worker placement game (except that you are using beautifully detailed plastic orcs...;-)  that is very visually appealing.  The game largely involves deciding what 3 actions you want to perform each turn (and in what order while figuring out which two actions will not be available for you the following turn as well).  Depending where your orc gets placed on the chart for each type of action, you will get more of something for less/more/maybe not receive something/etc.  The compensation levels for the different parts of the actions placement is very cleverly done.  After building up a dungeon and buying creatures and traps for four seasons, adventurers will troop through your dungeon seeking to explore and destroy.  Hopefully, you've prepared well for the adventurers and will prevent your dungeon from being destroyed too much!  Watch out for the paladin - if you go horribly evil, you best be prepared to handle a very dangerous foe!  Again, this was a good game - just not sure if I had fun - which is a bit of a problem!

Initial impression (8)

Deep and complex.Difficult to teach and master. Nice equipments. Good rulebook. Good theme. Prone to Analysis Paralysis. Long setup time.

2p games (with setup time)
First game was pretty long (3 hours). 
Second game got better (2 hours).
The game rules were very confusing and there were minor mistakes of rules throughout both games.
Third game was around 2 hours with the rules all covered.

At this point, I can say that the game is very brutal and unforgiving. The reward you get from playing well is not how well your dungeon is made, but rather whats left of it after the storms have passed and settled.

Can be played with a girlfriend (23yro) with a little edge and sense in gaming. She has taken the game well and love the imps.

See a lot of potential in this game that my experience should get better with more plays

Someone I was playing with said it was what Agricola was supposed to be, to which I say yes and no. Both are pretty Euro at heart, have kind of worker placement, are quite unforgiving and potentially have runaway leader problems, and give a puzzly aspecty of how do I make doing this worthwhile that is ultimately the draw of the game, at the expense of being really opaque your first play. Agricola has more of an engine building feel and most importantly has the variable setup with the cards. However, this one has a much more thematic scoring system. Yes I think the combat is overly convoluted (not surprising cause Chvatil), but defeating heroes for points feels a lot more cool than the negative point salad that is Agricola. Also I think experienced players could play this much faster, as the action programming allows for about half of the actions to be taken simultaneously. Finally, the way the actions are different strengths depending on who goes before/after seems to make the interaction feel greater than the sniping of the accumulating piles that is Agricola (regardless if it actually is more interaction or not), as you have to plan around it more.

However, at the end of the day this game still feels a bit too much like leaping through hurdles to score points, and the lack of variability really hurts it.

Really nice artwork. The fighting mechanizms are absolutely outstanding. This one is really fun, although it lacks a bit interaction. But it compensates that with the creativity of building your very own dungeon. One of my favorites....
Actually, when I think about this...The Victory Point System is the downside of this limiting it to one of the typical worker placement Excel-like games. I don't really understand why having the best dungeon where no hero could turnover a single tile does not win the game. I just don't like this abstract senseless vp stuff here...

This game seems to be inspired by the great PC game Dungeon Keeper.

It retains all the flavor and feel of said game while taking the best of worker placement and Vlaada's own mechanics, as well as tensions, from Galaxy Trucker and Space Alert.

There's certainly a heaping serving of luck and screwage, and much of the "just survive" element in this game; but perhaps that's much of the charm. Further once you have mastered the combat the game becomes an effortless fun-fest, and you can bask in the glory of your own evil.

It's more than what I expected, and on flavor alone this would get a 9; however the play is quite nice, and promises even better as it has a major set of unused components whose purpose is as yet unrevealed.

Can this designer fail? Not yet at least.

A game where you are the Dungeon Lord stocking a dungeon to kill parties of adventurers.  There is a phase where you lay out new rooms and buy monsters.  A phase then occurs where adventurers invade your Dungeon and do damage to your minions.  

I like the game but like Vlaada Chavatil games, there is a learning curve.  You need an excellent teacher to teach this game in order to get moving and play.  

I like it a lot, but I always need it to be retaught before I play.  No one in my group knows the game insider and out so it will not see a lot of play.

Played a couple of times.

Challenging and fiddly.  Oozing with theme and cuteness.  Overly long for the amount of stuff that each player actually gets done in the game.  Could use significant streamlining for combat system.  OK 2-player variation.  Frustrating given the difficulty of formulating a game-play strategy capable of being successfully carried out.  Great "achievement" and "title" end-game scoring system.  Very hot-and-cold game.  Sold post-pimping with nice storage components primarily due to length of game for what it was.

Willing to play again, but prefer the also overly complex puzzle plus game of Mage Knight.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

My review of Dungeon Lords:
1. The bits are good, except the quality of the paper tiles. They are easily damaged forthe first time to cut out. But the imps figures are impressive. The board design is fullly utilized. 
2. This is a calculation game, a little like Power Grid, more like Galaxy Tracker, since the latter game is from the same designer. Heavily replied on theme. 
3. The schedule of play is operational, less players' intrigue plans. The 1st briefing is long and got a lot of rules to memorize to get a whole picture of the game planning.
4. Got room to produce expansions afterwards: more monsters, more heroes....

Although ostensibly a worker-placement game, Dungeon Lords has more in common with its predecessor, Galaxy Trucker, than it does with Agricola. This is a game about building something, and then putting it through the wringer and seeing if it breaks. This is a much more complicated game than Galaxy Trucker though, making it a true gamers game. There's more to keep track of (and manage carefully); three types of resources, and a whole range of different point-scoring options.

Despite the complexity, Dungeon Lords is fun. Though it's possible to make perfect plans in theory, there's just enough unpredictability that your combat strategy can be thrown off completely, and the oftentimes disastrous consequences can be hilarious. This really highlights the standout feature of this game: although it offers all the deep thinkiness of a traditional Euro, it's also got the fun typical of lighter fare. This will be problematic for those who expect that the best strategic thinker should win, but for those who follow Knizia's mantra (the goal is to win, but it's the goal that's important, not the winning), this game will provide a hard-to-find combination of fun and strategy that is quite satisfying.

Blind simultaneous choices, not negligible randomness and lot of rules "for flavour" aren't what I like in games.
It is a resource management game with a "heavily thematic" approach that thus feels unsatisfying in both fields.
It only works with exactly 4 players and is way too long and fiddly for what it offers.

I had a very favorable impression after reading the rules, which manage to be an entertaining read all by themselves, and my first and so far only game did not do more or less than confirming that impression. This is very obviously a game you have to play a couple of times before you can go beyond just grokking the rules and developing something like a strategy, but it promises to be a rewarding and enjoyable journey. A very probable buy for me.

My only nitpick: the detailed and gloriously funny pictures on the gameboards would really have benefitted from a larger size, even though this would restrict the game to pretty big tables.

Played once.

As an avid Dungeon Keeper player in the past, I really dig the theme, although the peculiarities are a little weird in terms of the action selection.

Worker placement is not my thing.

Wow, not since the crappyness that was "Tempus" have I been so disappointed in a game that should have been good.

DL is your standard shitty eurogame wrapped this time in a great little pasted on theme. Anyone who loved the Dungeon Keeper  video game series will instantly be drawn to the game, and the artwork and theme are applied about as well as one can expect from a euro.  

What makes this otherwise perfectly enjoyable game suck so back is the scoring. It is another game where most of the players (regardless of what you do) will score about the same. Then the winner will be decided by some rather random part of the game. (like top decking an unbalanced room tile for example). 

I for one hate playing something where at the end I am completely surprised by who wins, and that is exactly what happened in DL. 

The scores are so close by nature that really only a few thing make or break the winner... why play for all that time just to have one tiny part of the game crown a random champion... its like Goa all over again.. no thank you. 

It is a shame because it could have been a great little game.

I love the theme. The game is a very tight management game with a brutal worker placement mechanic where instead of playing our workers one at a time, we all select secretly or worker's actions. That introduces a bit of bluffing and uncertainty to what is usually a straightforward and mechanical component. The game is a bit fidly with a lot of components and is AP prone. But with the right group, I love it.

Latest - March 2010.  Playing without the standard rules' guessing game and using a regular worker placement scheme makes the game an 8 for me now.  I despise the guessing part, because that is what it is (after ~20 games that way that is my opinion).

Updated rating after many games (2/12/10) - standard rules only, no variants.  This game is okay, not special, even though I want it to be.

Did not meet my high expectations.  Make sure to read the rules TWICE before playing.  A minor rules miss-play could be fairly major.

I am starting to doubt the staying power of the game.  One bad season and you are out of contention for the win.  The fun factor of Galaxy Trucker is not here (did not expect it), but the satisfaction of finishing with positive points is a 'big deal' kind of thing.  Happens every game in our games (15 games and nobody has gotten zero or less points).  The disparity in scores can also be huge showing that just one player got what they needed and the others did not.

After many games, only the 4p version is interesting.  The game is the most unforgiving game I recollect playing.  Some good stuff here, but one little mistake and you can't recover from it.  This may end up sitting on the shelf not seeing much more action.  Frustrating, as we _really_ want to like it.

Added some new bits and house rules to push this to a 7. A game that just doesn't seem to want me to enjoy it.

This game takes a lot longer than I thought it would to play.  That being said, it's worth the wait.  Friendly competition without the cutthroat mechanics.  Also, great artwork!

Downside: the rules book is poorly written.  In an attempt to make the book into a tutorial it sidesteps any sort of sensible organization.

EDIT 12/10/2012: Played Dungeon Lords again, this time I let a friend who is very good at tracking rules 'run' the game.  He too had the same problems that I did with the rules.  Despite the poor rulebook, the game remains extremely fun.

EDIT 03/31/2013: Played again, this time with four people who had played before.  It definitely improves on replay a lot.  I partially played it this time to see if I wanted the Festival Seasons expansion.  Since that is now listed on my 'owned' list, I'd say it went well.  I played Lords of Waterdeep the following day and this just blew that experience away.  My go-to worker placement at least for now.

RATING: 9.5
This isn't another worker placement game with a cute theme. It's a true gamer's game with scoring rounds in the form of combat sequences that are seamlessly intregrated into the game. This combat sequence punishes you for any mistakes you've made and is so much more exciting than simply counting up your VP's.

Dungeon Lords is one of those rare games where I keep thinking about it afterwards and discovering how I could have done better. This makes me want to try it again and again.

I let my friend borrow this and I'm not sure I'm ever going to ask for it back :) The game is the epitome of "multi-player solitaire". Sure there is some interaction with possibly getting denied actions but even that seems rather shallow. The point of the game is to prepare for adventurers to raid your dungeon. The crux of the game has literally zero interaction at all. It's also not hard to determine the best course of action for capturing adventurers. 

Overall it's an incredibly rules heavy game with very little return on investment.

I like this game a lot (although so far I've only played it once), but I think I'd have to play it at least a couple more times before I could learn it well enough to even attempt to plan things out properly.

Few days earlier I've played "Dungeon Petz" and concluded with the following thought:

"This is the kind of game which deepens my impression that modern eurogames are simply the rivalry of designers: who will put more elements, more sophisticated mechanisms, more variables to process". 

Dear, how much I was wrong then. Dungeon Petz comparing with Dungeon Lords seems to be easy play for children !

Dungeon Lords is the game for guys with huge heads to grasp all those tiny rules, exceptions and nuances. I could understand this if the game provided fascinating interaction between players. Instead it is another very sophisticated solitaire which might be the best for solo playing. OK. It is not my story. I don't like the games where the only interaction is caused by blocking resources of other players. Dungeon Petz regardless it is good example of such game attracted me with its fantastic theme. Dungeon Lords is much more complex and not so climatic.

A very heavy and thematic worker placement game.  Has a steep learning curve, so the introductory scenarios regarding combat are vital to being able to understand a key element of the game.

Once I figured out what was going on, I really enjoyed it.  There were never enough actions to do everything I wanted and smart placement made a big difference in whether things would go well, or very, very badly.

Would be keen to play again soon - because of the steep learning curve, this isn't the sort of game that is easy to pickup every 3 months or so and just play.

build your dungeon by bidding on various "jobs" for you minions to do (get food, get gold, dig tunnels, buy traps, recruit monsters, build rooms, reduce evil, get more minions).  Only a certain amount of each type of job is available and each position on the job chart costs different.  After a couple rounds of this, an invading force comes to loot your dungeon.  

Fun game with a good amount of things to keep track of.  Combat is done nicely.  The training scenarios were VERY helpful to get up to speed on combat quickly.

This game is a paradox. On the other hand it is very close to be very great game but similarly it is in constant danger to suddenly feel quite abysmal. The biggest pro is obviously surprisingly tense battle series. Too bad the resource gathering part is a bit tedious and generic. But battles made this. May be money is a bit too scarce resource?

RATING: 5.5
After two play, the game is still very good.  It's a bit rule intensive has we are a very hardened group of gamers and we did make a couple of mistakes.  It's still good enough after two play.  There is much to do with not so much actions.  So, in it's hearth, Dungeon Lord is a worker placement game with a twist.  I really like all of Vladimir Chvatil implementation in this one.  The humor is still really present and there is many viable course of action.  I anticipate my next play!  Hopefully, this time we will deal all the rules correctly.

RATING: 7
The action selection mechanism (chose 3 actions, in order, without knowing what actions others are choosing ... do know which actions they cannot chose).

I really like the theme.  I like the two distinct phases of the game:  building the dungeon and defending the dungeon.

Bought at Essen '09.

Even though my first play didn't go that well (I only managed to score 1 measly point in the end), we all had great fun playing this game, meanwhile looking up the rules and all.

This is not a family style game even though the art might seem "cute". It's a hard game, that's not so easy, but full of atmosphere. It's really a must buy for everyone who liked the PC game Dungeon Keeper way back when. Can't wait to play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun innovative game from one of my favorite designers.  The only downside is it's extremely "tight" in that you never have enough time to do much before the year is over.

So you don't really get to build much of a dungeon. It uses  worker placement to compete for resources to build the dungeon.

However, the artwork is adorable and the theme as in most Chvatil games is extremely well realized. It's VERY playable and quite enjoyable with the right group.

RATING: 9
Dungeon Lords is a really, really great game.  The mechanics are fresh, thought-provoking, and extremely tight throughout the game.  There's always something more you wish you could do, and constantly trying to outguess your opponents makes every decision feel significant.  The theme is incredibly fun and very enticing, and as you become more familiar with it, each tiny little rule in the game has a thematic (and often hilarious) explanation.  There's always the feeling of accomplishment in defending your dungeon, even if you don't come away with a victory in the game.  And it always leaves us wanting more and wanting to play again and again.  This game has taken over our gaming group, and it looks to be a long, long time before we tire of it.

RATING: 9
Building your own dungeon is fun! Interesting choices, trying to guess what opponents will do, trying to attract the right adventurers to match your strengths rather then your weaknesses, and the the fantastic mini-puzzle battles as the adventurers finally try to conquer your dungeon. This game is very themed, I actually feel like a dungeon lord when I play it!

Thief: Help me, priest guy, I'm hurt!
Priest: I'm sorry, that's a trap wound.
Thief: *Gurgle* It's a [i]spear[/i] trap!
Priest: Sorry, it's beyond my experience.
Thief: What the!? *Gurgle* I've been [i]stabbed[/i] by a [i]spear[/i], you festering twit!
Priest: I can't help you.
Thief: Gaaaa! (Stabs priest in eye with spear)
Priest: (Laughs) I can heal [i]that[/i]!

I don't know if I hate this game, but I definitely dislike. It's yet another version of the Eurovirus that tries to cajole its way into AmeriTrash cells by pretending to be about something cool.

But this is a puzzle game--and a very mechanical, uninteresting one at that--with a dungeon-building theme. The evil rating is fun, the rules are funny and well written and the thing looks great. But inside is a tedious and overlong math puzzle.

Honestly, now. The adventurers always walk in a certain order? The priest can heal injuries after a battle, but traps don't count as battle? Adventurers mostly die of fatigue, and you know exactly when that will happen? You have to kill the adventurers in a specific order to be "efficient"? Then add in a dungeon-building exercise with resource optimization, card management, bidding for resources, some resources being randomly and inexplicably unavailable to you at times?

This game will sucker in some ATers who think it looks like an exciting dungeon crawl experience. Not! This game will also repel some Eurogamers who think it looks like an exciting dungeon crawl experience. Not!

Sorry, it's just math. With pretty pictures. Look, I'd let Jessica Alba punch me in the face, just so I could honestly claim to have been touched by her. But I wouldn't let her do it a second time, and I wouldn't claim it had been fun. I feel much the same way about this game, except that it's not nearly as hot as Jessica Alba. Also, it cheated and punched me in the testicles.

After several awesome plays this is my current favorite. Wish I could play it more often, but the time commitment and my lack of available time make it difficult to squeeze in.  Learning curve pretty high on this one for new players.
This game is a lot of fun to play yet at the same time it is a real brain melting game.  Very unforgiving.  You almost need to be a cost accountant to maximize your play.  Fortunately, I don't play it that way.  I just try to have fun with it.  Now I want Dungeon Petz!

2010-06-15 Players set up a dungeon full of traps, and monsters to defend it against a horde of adventurers (mages and other heroes) who are (programmed) to attack it.  A great combination of worker placement, combat, spells and economics with a large array of scoring features.  It's a fun game and far less frustrating than Galaxy Trucker which uses time as a mechanic.  The system also has a number of mechanics that bash the leader making it so you may want to consider holding back until the end.  

UPDATE: sometimes this game can be super frustrating.  Especially with the harsh domino effect that follows.  Knocked rating down 1/2 a point.

Extremely fiddly (and that might be an understatement) but a very interesting game.  Nice twist on the now seemingly required 'worker placement' mechanic.  The fiddliness actually works here (not a detriment) as there really are a lot of wheels movement and I think it feels less fiddly after further plays.  Plenty of room for expansions/tweaks.

3player version felt a little screwy with the 'dummy' actions (disclaimer - this might just be self bias vs dummy actions as a mechanic in any game) but I thought the 4player version worked better.  Have not tried with 2, but my initial take is that it would be inferior to the 4player game.

Looking forward to further plays.

RATING: 8.8
Seriously, this is better than [gameid=31260]. There are so many dimensions to contend with, and the scoring system, while still wonky, doesn't have that artificial balancing built in, so there truly are those 'different paths', although I was not on one of them. 

Minion placement is done very well; having multiple positions on each action gives the whole affair more nuance than either of the top two games, whatever they are. The incomplete information you have to go on in the Robo Rally-style action selection is ~just~ incomplete enough; it simultaneously makes the decision-making more interesting, and quicker, by virtue of cutting down your options. Bravo.

There are an awful lot of rules, of which I caught about a third. And Evil, it turns out, is not a good thing; I found that confusing. Will be back for more.

RATING: 7
This game intrigued me from the start.  I still wanted to try it out once before buying it, just to make sure.  After my first play I bought it immediately.  The idea of running the dungeon instead of pillaging it was an interesting theme.  This definitely feels like a worker placement, but the theme also makes it better.

In dungeon lords you have two years to try your hand at being the lord of your own dungeon.  One of the enjoyable parts of this game is reading the rules, they are corny sometimes, but they made me laugh several times.  During each year you get 4 rounds to build up your dungeon and then the adventurers that have been meeting up at your entrance attack.  They will either attack 4 times or until you capture them all, whichever comes first.  The second year only differs in that the monsters and adventurers are more powerful.

The actions you can do to improve your dungeon are getting food, mostly for hiring monsters; making yourself less evil (sometimes you get to see what spells the wizards are working on as well), which helps you not to attract the powerful paladin; digging for gold, used for a variety of tasks (including paying your taxes), digging more tunnels, giving you more place for rooms and options when the adventurers attack; getting more imps to work in your dungeon; buying traps; hiring monsters; and getting rooms.  At the end of the 2-4 rounds you will get an adventurer assigned you based on how evil you are.

After the year is over the 3 adventurers at your dungeon attack.  You get to choose where they attack, with some limitations, which monster and trap to send in and hopefully you can work it out so they don't conquer very many of your tunnels and rooms.

After the second year the scores are tallied, this is done based on number of tunnels, rooms, captured adventurers, etc.  I find that usually these scores leave people fairly close.  Then there are several titles in which the holder of the title will get 3 additional points, 2 each if multiple people are tied.  The titles are for things like most evil, most rooms, most tunnels, richest, most monsters, most imps, etc.

I really just love the idea of this game and it is a lot of fun.  There are some downsides, but if you have a regular gaming group these shouldn't be a big deal.  The rules take a while to explain.  It usually takes 20-30 minutes to give people a good feel for what is going on.  They included 4 setup attacks that you can go over as well so people understand how the attacking is going to work, if you go through these it will take another 15 minutes.  The first game is going to take at least 90 minutes.  However, after getting through these hurdles subsequent games shouldn't go a lot better.  There isn't any direct interaction; however, with the included expansion (you need to go to zman games to download the rules) you can add some interaction which makes things even more interesting.

I gave this a good rating because it is unique, at least in my collection, and I'd definitely never turn down a game.  However, I couldn't go too high, because it is just too difficult to bring out for a new group.  If you have a regular gaming group, I wouldn't pass this game up.

In many ways, basically a multi-player solitaire, puzzle game.  

Gaining the initiative in  auctions is critical and is one of the few ways of interacting/disrupting your opponent's plans.  I like the theme and how they mesh with some of the  game mechanics, but not really sold on the game play.  Wasn't as fun as I'd expected.

Not optimistic about the game's longevity either.

There is a lot to be excited about in this game.  The quality of components, the theme and tough decisions are all very appealing to me.  Now that i've played it a few times it goes faster and the enjoyment rises up for me (if all the players aren't new, the game really shines).  Figuring out the battles can still be a bit tricky and yes the game is very short on the number of decisions and things you can do, but because it feels and plays different in my mind the rating is higher.

Played once, with four players (none of whom had played before).

In a fun switch from the typical fantasy world, players are dungeon lords who are building an evil dungeon, which they must defend from pesky adventurers who want to destroy the player's creation.  The game is dripping with theme; players get to buy traps, hire monsters, and build rooms in their dungeon, all to thwart those pesky adventurers.

While game is fun, it took a long time to play (3+ hours) and there are a bunch of rules that come into play at various points that players kept forgetting (e.g., what the order of damage was in battle, exactly how thieves prevented damage, when you had to pay to use a trap).  

Players have to fight off two bands of heroes during the game.  In the first half of the game they're building up to fight the first round, and there are lots of fun options and tradeoffs (you can hire monsters, but it makes you more evil, and if you get too evil you attract a paladin).  However, it's difficult to predict what you'll have to pay for an item, and thus difficult to predict where you'll end up on important tracks (like the evil track, which determines which adventurer's you'll face and if you get the paladin attacking you). 

In summary, the theme is great, but there's a lot of randomness for a game of this length.

Might be tempted to play again, but not really my cup of tea. Terribly fiddly for what it offers, and I'm not very keen on that kind of blind action selection. 2 hours, and I know many better games to play within that kind of timeframe. Add thirty minutes of rules explanation, another thing I abhor - I much prefer games with easier rules.

I was expecting not to like this--after all, it is YET ANOTHER worker placement and resource conversion game--but somehow this didn't seem so redundant. Part of it is the clever theme, which provide moments of side entertainment of which something like, say, Keyflower is utterly devoid. But it's also that the simultaneous action selection sort of overrides the worker placement aspect. I'm not a huge fan of either mechanism, but at least it's variety.

That said, this felt more like a quirky pastime than a meaty game. Choices were fairly constrained, and there are an awful lot of hidden elements to the game, limiting your ability to lock in any long-term plans. Theme tends to wear off after a few plays for me, so I expect this to earn its six and then fall to the wayside.

Nagyon jó kis játék. Azért csak ennyi, mert elég hosszú a kezdet a játékot nem ismerőknek. Gyönyörű grafika, ötletes minijáték. A worker placement is olyan típusú, amit még el tudok viselni. Gyakorlatilag majdnem mindig van menekülési útvonal. 3 játékossal is ugyan olyan jól működik, mint 4-el.

Colourful and fun looking art and theme hides a rules-heavy Eurogame maths-puzzle.

The only real player interaction is when other players fill up one of the options for the round before you get there, meaning you don't get to do anything at all (you are completely at the mercy of the first player marker in this department). Otherwise as with most Eurogames you could be sat playing on your own for all it matters. If you are a Eurogamer then good for you! You'll love sitting together in a group and ignoring each other like normal!

Unfortunately for me Dungeon Lords is rules heavy and requires lots of juice for little in the way of real choices or control. The final point being for two hours and that much effort I'd rather be playing Arkham Horror. ;- D

Rating may change after more plays...

RATING: 7.5
A totally original combination of elements: a humorous theme (which I'm told is probably influenced by the old PC game Dungeon Keeper), a quirky worker placement/bidding war in the first half, and fiendishly difficult puzzles to solve in the 2nd half as you try to pick off the gang of adventurers before they run through your dungeon like a knife through butter. Vlaada has gone on record that his favourite contemporary designer is Stefan Feld, and I'm pretty sure that this game owes a debt to another famously punishing run-the-gauntlet kind of game, Feld's In the Year of the Dragon--it's got the same sense of seeing a catastrophe coming a long way off and juggling resources and actions in order to fend them off as best you can.

Further thoughts: this is an awfully long game for so much to hinge on random, unforeseeable elements (you can mitigate some of this by working hard to peek at the adventurers' upcoming cards, but other things are very random, like traps). I like the challenge of dealing with randomness but it can be frustrating to have hours of work scuppered by one bad combat card rather than by good play by your opponents.

Also: it's pretty harsh to get absolutely no compensation for being shut out of a spot. (As opposed to say Alchemists where at least you get a favour card for every two unused cubes.)

Euro-worker placement with very live theme. On the euro-part, the game is great in mechanics, and deep in strategies, because of the many ways of scoring points.
On the ameri-part, the theme is there in every move you make an mostly at the end of the year where you have to fight the good guys. Especially with an alive group the game shines over 9/10.

Admittedly, I played this very early on in the hobby, so my rating may be different if I was to play again. I just remember wanting to try it because it has an unique theme I'm interested in, which is building your own dungeon. The game ended up being complex for complexity's sake, and I think that this was one of the early games to turn my wife off from heavier board games. I absolutely hate the fact that you have to control dummy players with less than 4, too. I'm usually okay with Vlaada's games, even if I don't always enjoy them, but this one was the worst I've played from him.

Complicated and brain-burny game, much less fun than its sibling Dungeon Petz, even if brilliantly thematic and engrossing.  Takes much, much longer to play than the advertised time once one factors in getting the rules correct and the multiplicity of choices.

In a way this is like Agricola where you build a dungeon instead of a farm, but unlike Agricola the goal is not to produce things but to survive being invaded by adventurers. I didn't like this game that much because I felt like the combat system was kind of lame, and it just seems too complex and too much trouble for what fun I got out of it. Anyone who isn't a hardcore gamer is going to have trouble with this game due to complexity.

RATING: 9
In this 2-4 player game, each player is a dungeon keeper, attempting to get food, imps, traps and monsters. At the end of a building year, adventurers visit your dungeon and try to trash it. You use your monsters and traps to enslave the adventurers to earn points. It is an economic game with building, then using your building to collect points. This is Vlaada Chvatil's best game so far.

This is a very engaging game, with many tough decisions to make. The rules are funny to read, and it is a complex game. I really enjoy this game. Things are tense during the card plotting phase, where you wonder if you might get shut out, or if you will have enough money to do all the things you want. Then you might end up unexpectedly with what you did or did not want, and you have to adapt. I still haven't had the chance, nor the bravery to attempt to attract a paladin, but hope to change that sometime soon!

RATING: 7
I really enjoy the resource management aspect, just the combat part really doesn't do it for me.  It seems just so difficult to actually manage your dungeon, let alone plan for fighting the adventurers.  My other complaint is that it's all very fiddly and busy.
I really do want to like it more, but for the time being these two issues let it down for me. Perhaps I'll get a bit better at the planning/combat and it will shine, but we shall see...

The humor is amazing, as always with games by Vlaada. Deceptively difficult and hard to get a positive score the first few times you play, but once you get to know the game, it becomes super fun. The game involves building a puzzle for yourself (the combat) and gathering the tools to solve that puzzle, but if you don't know what you're doing, you can easily wind up without the right tools and with an unsolvable puzzle that destroys all your stuff.

Best with 4, but has a totally workable 2-player variant.

RATING: 6
My one and only playing of this was at BGG.Con '09, sometime around 2:00 A.M. so my views on the game may be a bit skewed.

I had heard so many positive things about this game and was really looking forward to trying it out. I love D&D and fantasy themes, so the fact that a strategy game, and not some lame dungeon crawler, used this as a background intrigued me.

What I found was a very fiddly rule system and a sort of blind-bidding mechanic that didn't thrill me. Yes, I get that you can figure out to a degree what other people might be doing, but that requires you to examine every player's board... something I really dislike doing in games. This game also relies on timing, and my sleep-deprived brain was nowhere near up to the task.

So, I give Dungeon Lords a tentative 6. I'm hoping that a second play with a clear mind will show me the greatness that others see. Stay tuned.

While easy to teach, this game is anything but easy. It can still be fun as a casual game if you don't care who wins, but in fact it is a very intense worker placement game that involves a high degree of planning ahead and knowing what your oppoenets are doing. Very strategic, very fun, and a great theme too.

RATING: 2
Dungeon Lords' rulebook is so dense and uninituitive that just getting through it is a chore, game setup takes an eternity, and (as far as I can tell from the unintelligible instruction book) the "2-4 players" is a complete lie as, if you play with less than 4, the game requires you to play simplified versions of 1 or 2 players to bring the number up to 4.

Dr. Seuss was challenged to write a story using just 25 words and he wrote the wonderful Green Eggs & Ham. Vlaada should challenge himself to do something similar with components and rules and produce a game that is quicker to learn, faster to play, random enough that new players can win, yet deep enough to keep veterans coming back; In a word: Fun.

Another great theme-laden game.  I really enjoy playing this game, however there are a few things that bring it down for me.  

It is a bit complicated for what it tries to accomplish, the rules are a bit daunting for new players...AND for me to explain as well.  This game has to be played with 4, the 3 and 2 player rules are annoying and never felt right to me.

You go through 4 phases of the game, 2 worker placement phases, and 2 battle phases.  In the worker placement phase you are placing workers to hire monsters, build your dungeon, and collect various rewards that will help you during the game.  In the battle phases heroes come to your dungeon and you have to kill them.

Although the game is a bit complicated, and can really only be enjoyed by exactly 4 people, it really is a fun and engaging game.

It's a cute little puzzle game.  There's a lot going on, and it's one of the few times I've seen a limited-turn, too-many-options game work.  It works very well.

Why the 5.5?  Dude.  The game is $65.  The game is not worth $65.  I picked up TI3 for approximately the same.  I can pick up Republic of Rome for approximately the same.  BSG is $50, infinitely more geeky, and yet will still hit the table more often than this puzzle.  There has been a lot of game price inflation since the economy went kaboom.  A lot of game companies are going to fall because people cannot continue to purchase games at these rates.

Half scrambling worker placement game, half Galaxy-Trucker-like game of being blown up. It's not nearly as hilarious when that happens, though it is hilarious when your carefully placed minions get shunted to the wrong spaces!

It seems complex as first, but the learning setup is very good. You need to keep an eye on so many things for end game, so I didn't do well on my first play. Not really sure, but I think a diverse party can be more dangerous than a party of wizards. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WATCH OUT FOR THE WIZARDS!

RATING: 7.5
Very good game. Strong themed, lots of possibilities, decisions and paths, etc. It contains all the elements that make a good game.

I don't score higher because:
-> It's not easy to play it in 90 minutes, as advertised. Games tend to be long and they actually feel a little long.
-> Many rules, it's difficult to teach and the rulebook is a mess (I played 5 games and there are so many rules, that you always forget something and I always have troubles to find it)
-> Setup is long.

Still, it's a game I love to play from time to time :D

RATING: 8
There are plenty of similarities to the designers other game, Galaxy Trucker. In both there are several rounds (2 in DL, 3 in GT) where you build up your resources and then there is resolving phase at the end of the round where you battle "against the game". In Dungeon lords you have better chances to influence what you'll get at this final phase as in GT it is much more random. Overall DL is more of a gamer's game out of these two but still retaining plenty of humour that was what made GT a great game. 

Rulebook is using this humour well to make you remember things that otherwise would easily be forgotten but there is still (as in GT) a bit too much tiny rules that you easily forget. The game is quite rules-heavy but a very good game.

Pretty much a four player only game.

RATING: 5
Firstly the art work, production and theme are all excellent. A great start.

The game is about building a dungeon and placing measures to ensure it survives. Damage limitation is the name of the game here. The bulk of the building and planning is a parallel worker selection game mechanism, which is nice enough and the semi-blind selection adds a bit of variation from the swath of worker placement games that have come before. The first part is in preparation for the “fun” part of the game where you see how well your dungeon can withstand assault by do-gooder heroes using resources you built/collected in the first part.

Looking at a solid game then? Well, almost. The game is really let down by the scoring. Virtually everything either gives you points or takes points away so scores are pretty close by the end of the game as long as you didn’t mess up too badly. The winner is then determined by some arbitrary scoring device or the outcome of a few lucky events. Players will have no real concept of who will win until the final tally. With so much investment and micromanagement this is really frustrating and the game isn’t fun or frivolous enough (despite appearances, this is  firmly in the euro game camp) to be an experience game where no-one cares about the outcome.

If you can live without all the lovely pieces and the desire to be a dungeon lord, then playing In the Year of the Dragon will give you a similar experience, but where your strategy actually matters.

RATING: 7
This is good! The overall idea is simple and satisfying: compete for resources to build a "mechanism", then test it; score or lose points based on the outcome. The theme is very well executed. The rules are clear and consistent: they are also easy to learn, given the variety of options available. The components are well produced and helpful, particularly the player aids and the board.

My only caveat is that [i]Dungeon Lords[/i] seemed a tiny bit light and too short. I think it needs a third round ("year"). This might be unfair - I have been playing [i]Le Havre[/i] and [i]Shipyard[/i], which are also "build a mechanism" games and quite a bit longer.

The rules aren't simple, but the game play at first appears to be.  I didn't like this much after a first play but after the second play I started to see the potential and now I really enjoy it.

RATING: 6
Most important: It's overall a multiplayer solitaire, and I'm getting increasingly annoyed at this, let's say "New School of contemporary board game design". 

Second most important: It's a thematic puzzle, pure mental arithmetics. It's like: I have 3 food now. If I play that action card on my last free spot, I might be able purchase the troll, which would make sense if the paladine came to my dungeon after the next season. But I in order to inflict 4 damage, I need another food, which I may only get if I play the food action on the last spot blablabla.... and so on. It will give you a headache. And in addition to that, the rules are twisted and complex. Be sure you won't recall all rules during your first plays.

Sounds like your game? Heavily focussed on skill, no randomness, no kingmaking, no leader bashing? All true, except for the randomness. In short: I have the impression that skill alone won't make you win this game. I have not figured out yet how to really play it well - but it seems to me that attemps to analyse and calculate the optimal move are just futile, because you can't be sure what your opponents are going to do, and that will decide if your plans work out or not. Now, you think this could be mitigated by judging the needs of your opponents? In theory - yes; in practice - hardly. There is so much calculation involved for your own moves alone that I don't think anyone can calulate his opponents' moves at the same time.

Yes, it's full of humour, yes, it's got a hilariuos theme, yes it's fine, it's well designed, the rules even have a plausible background, and reading the rules is an experience of its own. The game, however, doesn't create much atmosphere. Combat isn't exciting, it's determined under the assumption of perfact play. The only question is: Did you play perfectly? 

All in all, the game represents the all the aspects of current gaming I dislike the most. The theme alone makes it worth playing once in a while. However, I've had several invitations to play DL within the previous months, but rejected them all in the favour of other games.

Since right now the lowest rating for this game is mine, I feel obliged to explain. This is just the kind of game I don't like, a purely numeric strategy combined with an exclusive (i.e., one in which you could be excluded from choices) worker placement mechanic. Plus, the theme doesn't do anything for me.

Fantastic theme, solid mechanics, simple gameplay, and yet extremely stressful to play because every choice you make is extremely valuable. The game is kind of hard to learn the first time because of how many rules there are, classic Vlaada, but the gameplay is much simpler than the rules make you think it is.

Another superb game from CGE.  I had chance to read the rules for this and know a bit about it before release.   It looked fantastic.  This was my most anticipated game at Essen.  When I picked it up, I was very pleased.  Quality of the components excellent, everything just spot on.  

Played it on the Thursday night at Essen.  Was actually even more fun than I thought it would be :)

Was really impressed with this game.  During the rules explanation it sounded overly complicated and like it was going to be a long painful game.  However, the theme and play are really fun.  I could also see this game not taking that long with people who are familiar with the rules.  I had tons of clarification questions since there are floods of mechanics in small spurts, so having a vet at the table was crucial to keeping the flow of the game.

RATING: 8.5
Just had two plays, so this rating may change. First play (3p) was rough, missed a few important rules. Second play was much smoother and *felt* faster, even though it still took a solid two hours. I think we were just feeling more fluent with the game.

Terrific cute theme hiding a hardass, take-no-prisoners, gamers game. The basic shape of play is pretty easy: compete for three positions amongst eight different actions, assign workers to do things in your dungeon, then deal with a team of three or four adventurers coming in to wreck your shit. It's similar in the arc to Galaxy Truckers, only not frenetic and ... well, the demolition derby inside the dungeon is just not as much fun as with your GT spaceship.

Actual play is astonishingly deep and varied, and I suspect it'll take dozens of plays to really figure out how to play it well. Those eight actions are very hard to choose from, the game just doesn't give you nearly enough turns to get everything done, and the actual beat-the-heroes stage is a wicked-hard logic puzzle.

Great theme, great bits. You know you're going to enjoy the game when it comes with an official Evilometer. Game play is preparation for combat, then combat, then repeat. Preparation consists of competing for worker placement spots (for gold, food, monsters, traps, digging more tunnels, etc). Your placements are planned in secret then executed 1 by 1 in turn order, so you're never sure what you may need to pay as each spot has a different type of payment depending on the order you go in - some it's better to be first, others it's better to be middle or later. Sometimes payment is up or down on the evilometer which is important because the more evil you are, the tougher the adventurer you're going to have to fight off in the combat phase. Combat is just inflicting as much hit points as you can as quickly as you can on the adventurers allocated to you using the traps and monsters that you've bought - no dice. It's a nice little puzzle on how best to play your monsters and traps to beat them as fast as you can. Each turn one stays alive, a part of your dungeon is lost - so build plenty. Scoring is varied - points for kills, most monsters, most tunnel, etc. There's a good balance of interactive luck, some luck with magic cards that come out in combat, but room for plenty of decision making. I'm looking forward to playing more.

Yes, this is a really good game and I've seen non-D&D players like it.  What is more important is if you like resource management games, as that is the meat of this game.

Hardcore game in the likes of Caylus, Goa, Puerto Rico and Agricola. It has a very complex playing system, where you really need to pay close attention to EVERYTHING... and there are LOTS of things... so that makes for a lot of attention in one game! Once the rules are mastered though, the game is not so difficult to play, but extremely difficult to master! Top notch challenge! Unlike the afore mentioned games, in Dungeon Lords, you don't built up a multiplying game, where with good strategy you obtain more resources over time. here, everything is on short supply all the time... very tough game to master!

- The rules are surprisingly fun to read due to the demon character that is always adding some cool insight. Good way to write rules, and they are well organized as well. Brilliant!

Rating after one play: thematic fullfilling experience. The game promises "Dungeon Keeper" feeling and it fullfills it in spades. Great. My rating will very well go up with additional plays.
Update (25/06/11): This game is heavy, this game is complex, this game is very thematic and always a ride! Played ONLY with 4 players and wish to keep it this ways. Therefore only few plays. But I LOVE this, have to rise my rating to a 9.
Update (03/12/12): played this game also with fewer people (3). It works just as fine as with 4. a great great game.
Update: After playing it a few times with the expansion I must say it stood the test of time for me. 10!

Really cool theme and the mechanics fit well. At first play it is hard to tell what you will need, since you work up to your first battle through four phases of gathering resources, monsters and traps and then fight your first group of attackers. Then you redo the whole thing again and have one scoring at the end based on how well you fought off the attackers and how much stuff you have left.

Il Gamer's Game per eccellenza: difficoltà sopra la media, tema molto nerd e grafica che non accetta mezze misure, piace o fa schifo. Spassosissime le due fasi di gioco "pianificazione impietosa" (nella quale si pagano cari cincischiamenti nell'ordine di piazzamento) e quella di azione. 
Ma quello che fa godere davvero sono i particolari, nel tema e nelle meccaniche: da una parte le tasse da pagare al Ministero dei Dungeon, le caratteristiche dei mostri, il "razzismo" verso i fantasmi; dall'altra finezze come il metodo che assegna eroi più forti ai Lord più cattivi (per non parlare del paladino che scende in campo se stuzzicato), il sistema per impedire di giocare due volte la stessa carta, la trasposizione dei poteri dei vari personaggi, e così via. 
Tema molto americano e meccaniche molto tedesche: che sia il Sacro Graal dei Giochi da Tavolo? Un gioco non per tutti, ma sicuramente un piccolo capolavoro.

This game has a great theme, and the gameplay is pretty good, but quite hard to explain to new players.  There is some simultaneous action selection (queued like RoboRally), so if you have a strong distaste for that you may not enjoy it, but I didn't find it to be that offensive.  Basically, each player secretly selects 3 actions every turn; usually the first player to select any given action gets the least benefit at a small cost, the second player gets the best deal, the third player pays a lot for a good benefit, and the fourth player gets hosed (though it's rare for all 4 players to select the same action in a given turn).  These actions allow you to gather resources to build up your dungeon and fight off a series of adventurers.  Most of the points at the end of the game revolve around how well you were able to stave off those adventurers, and how impressive your dungeon is overall.  Where I find the game lacks is in actually fighting the adventurers: this is a rules-heavy process that isn't well-connected with the rest of the game.

Here's a different theme: be the dungeon master and beat the adventurers coming to loot your dungeon. A funny worker placement game, very thematic, with one of the most hilarious rulebooks I have ever seen. Recommended, although it can be very lengthy! Best with exactly 4 players, recommended as well with 2, but not with 3, as the dummy player acts randomly.

Decent theme and heavier weighted worker placement game.  I enjoyed its many tough decisions and felt like I was actually defending a dungeon.  I also liked how multiple people could go to the same area, however had different effects to perform that action.  It can be slightly confusing with the adventurers attack order, however we may have messed up that rule.

This game just has a fun central mechanic of fighting off the heroes and builds from that. The resource management and worker placement feels all the more fun because you feel like you're powering up to stop an invasion, where the same mechanics in other games grow weary.

Based on the PC game (Dungeon Keeper), Dungeon Lords puts the players in the role of a dungeon manager of sorts. 

Build tunnels and rooms, recruit monsters to defend the dungeon, collect taxes and food, recruit personnel to work and at the end of the year defeat the adventurers that arrive to destroy your work.

A lot of stuff to manage, a very well implemented theme and great components, make this one a real winner.

This game is right up my alley.... as I really enjoy solving puzzles. It is played in two phases -- first you build a dungeon by digging out tunnels and rooms and obtaining traps and monsters. During the second phase, adventurers try and raid your tunnel -- you have to use the equipment and personnel you have to fend them off as quickly as possible.

Bought at Essen 09. Played the introduction game, we had a lot of fun. Cute imps! 

Played another 2 games, both times introducing a new player and it was a success. Managed to get a negative score on my third play, there really is a lot to keep track of in this game, and a mistake can be really costly.

Great game, even after 18 plays it's still hard to do things right. We still need to try the extra tiles (though we still don't really need to make things more difficult).

They released the rules for the expansion that was included, and it sounds like fun. Need to try.

We finally tried the expansion, and it was a nice way to add something extra to the game. Giving another player an item means you make their life a bit harder, but also that you may be giving them an extra point. Good addition.

This is an amazing game!  It definitely takes a play or two to feel like you can keep your head above water.  It really feels a lot like Agricola in terms of blocking/worker-placement and trying to spin a lot of plates at once.  It's very challenging; one of a class of games where you struggle to beat the game as well as your opponents (although I think the built-in expansion might make your opponents a bigger threat).  Although it's easy to learn from the rulebook, especially when you do the practice examples, I worry that it would be very difficult to explain to a new player.  I love the humorous/evil theme, the artwork is beautifully detailed and quite charming.

What makes this game interesting is that it's "flipped": the players manage dungeons, and non-player characters are the dungeon crawlers who come to attack you.

Strategy wise, the game is unforgiving which is something that some people might find to harsh to play and the complexity is a bit overwhelming for some.

However, this is a true gamers game !! Where every decisions are keys to victory, otherwise the adventurers will trash your dungeon if you don't plan well.

Great theme. Gameplay feels like some kind of combination of Kingsburg, Puerto Rico & Galaxy Trucker (or other similar games along those lines).

Luck is enough of an element so as to keep things unpredictable, and varied between games.

Components are great except for some of the cardboard pieces not being cut very well - tricky to punch without tearing them.

Rules are very well done, though a bit long for the complexity of the game.

Also takes a while to teach people how to play - a decent grasp of the combat basics are needed before you can even begin to touch on the main rounds of play. A first learning game with new players takes too long - the first "year" is more than enough, with scoring taking place and a quick summary of what would be different in the 2nd year for another time.

Plays well with only 2 players, even though you each need to handle cards for a "dummy" player - something I normally avoid but is easily managed here, and actually becomes part of your tactical play.

Chvatil's design is unmistakable and we see his trademark "build stuff, then run it through an obstacle course to see how well you did" technique here. The theme of Dungeon Lords is hilariously cute and succeeds wildly despite Euro worker placement and some oddities (I get a room for free but you had to pay one gold? Okay...) I like that it is very hard to tell who is doing well and this keeps everyone involved until the end. There are multiple strategies, and tight resources. A unique game in a crowded genre.

Plays just like you would hope a dungeon keeper game would.  Much like Galaxy Trucker, fun to build and destroy your stuff.  Plays well with 4 - I'm suspicious of the lack of tension with fewer.  2p with dummies sounds uninteresting.

Dungeon Lords is dullness incarnate. I strongly dislike this awful game. Dungeon Lords is a 15 minute experience in a 2+ hour package because upkeep and automatic actions consume 3/4 of the play time. I think in the whole game you make maybe 16 decisions total. I can't believe this game was created by the same designer of [thing=25613][/thing].

RATING: 6
In this game, you are an evil overlord, trying to build a nice dungeon for yourself, but your general evilness keeps attracting pesky hero tiles that will try to destroy what you've built. This game uses a fantastic action prediction system where you need to guess what action cards your opponents have selected to be able to resolve your actions fully. The overall goal of the game is building the best dungeon while trying to take the least amount of damage from the heroes. This is also an interesting balancing act, as killing the heroes is worth a lot of points, but you are always risking biting off more than you can chew. 

The reason I didn't keep this is the board and charts, while pretty, detract substantially from clarity, and with fewer than 4 players this game absolutely does not work. The game introduces dummy players which eliminates the whole point of predicting your opponents. It just wasn't compelling enough to keep for it being so restrictive.

So complex... one of the only games that can totally overwhelm my mind to the point that I can't find the best decision.  Very puzzle-like in the combat resolution.  Fun interaction with trying to guess what other people will choose.  The order you choose your actions in is SO important.  Very demanding and unforgiving - if you guess wrong and end up just one slot off it can totally wreck your plans for the rest of the game!

This is one of those games that I like way more than my friends do, so I never get to play it.

RATING: 6
I slightly surprised myself by enjoying Dungeon Lords as it includes several features that I am not usually fond of: worker placement, blind bidding and a fantasy theme. And as I sat through the lengthy rules explanation, I feared the worst. But it is really not as complex to play as it is to explain and the excellent sense of humour helps to carry everything off. It's essentially two games: a worker placement/resource management phase to equip your dungeon with rooms, traps and monsters; followed by a combat phase in which your dungeon is visited by heroes and you must puzzle out the best way to capture them before they destroy all your hard work. The blind-bidding mechanic for placing the workers is really clever, though can lead to AP as there is a lot of information to take into account. Once the blind orders have been made, resolving them is very quick and easy. The combat phase is reminiscent of Galaxy Trucker as you see whether your design is going to hold together or be wrecked. There's no player interaction in this part of the game, but it's still good fun seeing how everyone fares. In my first game I found it hard to even really think about the final scoring as I was too busy learning the ropes, but I'd be interested in trying again. Not a game I'll be buying, but a lot better than I had feared.

Enjoying this one solitaire - Lots of fun running two dungeons in a relatively friendly manner.
Also sometimes play with just one dungeon, and three dummy dungeons. It makes for a more relaxed experience than trying to make good decisions for two dungeons at the same time. It more or less works, though it can make things more random. Also something has to be done to control the evil-o-meter for this to really work out well.

Rating of 6 after one play.  I really wanted to like this more.  I love the theme, and the art. The components are top notch, and the rules are a hoot.  However, at the end of it all, the game didn't really thrill me as much as I had hoped.  I enjoy the second half of the game (the kickin' ass part), but the building phases were a bit weak. It just doesn't seem like you get to accomplish much throughout the game... hire a monster, buy a trap, get some food, get some gold, dig a tunnel, buy a room... oops that's all... round over. The only real decision during the buying phase is trying to outguess your opponents in order to vie for the best position on the offer spaces. Really a shame.

RATING: 9
Excellent, fun game! I was expecting this game to have a lot of downtime and to spend too much time watching other people take their turns and impatiently waiting my own, but no! The turns are quick and everyone is involved in it at all points. And it also isn't the "multiplayer solitaire" game that I was expecting, as you can make your choices based on what other people do, and can be screwed over if you're not careful! The theme is a major draw for me and I think Vlaada Chvatil has managed to hit that sweet spot between the Euro and thematic games with this. I'm predicting that this will become one of my favourite games after a few more plays!

RATING: 5
5 - I don't really get it, basically it's worker placement meets dungeon keeper so I should like it, except you never get to build a sprawling dungeon since you're restricted on size and tunnel placement and you're really just racing to not be the shittiest since in the combat phase which feels really klunky and jarring the heroes walk in a wreck all of your shit and then you try to build a little more and then they come back and do it again and whoever hasn't had their ass completely turned inside out by the heroes gets the most points and wins.  I don't enjoy the game much, it's not bad but it's a lot of explaining for new players and it's hard to keep morale high after the first year no matter how many times you remind them that "the heroes are going to try and ruin our dungeons and they are most likely going to succeed," and since it has a strict 4 player requirement unless you want to randomly deal worker placement for 3rd or 4th player to make the game work I can rarely drum up the right number of interested parties.

*****
The funny thing is, I've played Galaxy trucker and laughed my ass off through the whole game as my ship gets blown to pieces.  I think it's because in GT you get to build massive ships and you only have yourself to blame when things go horrible, whereas DL it feels like the game handcuffs you before you begin.

To be fair I only watched a 4-player game. But also to be fair, this the exactly the type of Euro I've come to loath. Layers on layers of sub-systems to induce a degree of chaos and AP/brain-burning. Like an overwrought version of Pillars of the Earth while being more easily optimized than Agricola. I know I'll never play this game except under duress.

Nagyon sok rákészülés, álmatlan szabályelemzés, forgolódással teli éjszaka után, végre kipróbáltuk. A szabály ajánlata ellenére csak ketten játszottunk, DE ez nagyon jó játék és a szabály után kifejezetten egyszerűnek hatott, no nem a játék, hanem a menete világossá vált. 

Nagyon egyedi, nekem tematikus játék, sok remek ötlettel és érdekes grafikával. Nem feltétlenül nekem tetsző, de valahogy megbocsát érte az ember. 
Remek szórakozás. 
több négyfős játék után kiderült, hogy sok más játékkal ellentétbe ebben nem célom a győzelem, egyszerűen élvezem a játékot vele. Csúcs jó a tematika, amit egyébként nem szoktam igényelni, de itt nagyon jó. Csomó kis apró feszültség van benne(vagy inkább izgalom). Szuper.

Way too fiddly for my taste. I dont like the idea of each player having his own little boards. It might work for Puerto Rico but it does not for Dungeon Lords, it feels like playing a solitaire game with some people sticking around.

I loved the theme, but not much else.
There are an awful lot of fiddly and inelegant rules to memorize for such a straight forward game, and a considerable amount of unforeseeable randomness in monster availability and trap selection that can absolutely ruin a player through no fault of their own.
I ended up winning by a massive margin, and felt it had nothing to do with having made better or more tactical choices throughout the game.   It's just kind of arbitrary how things end up working out.

What a brutal and awesome game. I can't remember the last time a game has thrashed me this hard and left me asking for more.

Dungeon Lords blends a handful of my favorite mechanics into one intense experience. Perhaps my favorite part of the game, and the most unforgiving, is when the heroes invade. Only the most careful planning will prevent your dungeon from being totally demolished.

Overall: It doesn't matter how few points I score in Dungeon Lords. This is simply a hilariously fun ride. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
By the designer of Through the Ages, so I had high hopes for this one, and I have not been disappointed. In a sense, it's an economic engine game, with a pause at halftime and another at the end to see how well your engine withstands non-player attacks. There are lots of choices and plenty to think about. It will take practice and familiarity to play it well.

The theme is silly but stronger than you often get in economic games. (Don't let the cartoony art fool you into thinking that this is a family game.) Components are nice overall, except that we had trouble punching some of the cardboard in our copy and had to glue up some tears.

If you have trouble with busy artwork on boards, you might want to avoid this one. The board art carries a lot of useful info and I think it's laid out well, but the overall impression can be one of confusion and "too much detail" until you get used to it. The rules are a bit long and complex and the bits a bit fiddly: I don't mind this but you might.

RATING: 7
Cleverly put together, combining a puzzle with some blind worker placement and a resource engine game. Each part is simple enough so that the whole game is approachable. The player interaction is subtle, but I think it is what determines the outcome of the game. The obvious parts are keeping an eye on the leader's likely titles and trying to tie them, and planning the timing of your card plays. The less obvious and I think key part is manipulating your place on the evilometer: a party of one or two character types that you have planned for is a pushover, other combinations - especially ones you didn't plan for (lots of thieves when you have mainly traps) can be a disaster. Good fun.

End of the years are too solitaire and the trap room is a bit strong I think. However a very nice and surprisingly quick game for the game that includes (and system is clearly designed for it) the theme so well.

RATING: 7
Once again, a very nice combination of a compelling theme and deep Euro mechanics by Vlaada Chvatil. I really enjoy the planning phase and the timing of the actions offers some clever interactions with other players (while at first glance everybody builds his dungeon on his own). Personally I would like a little less randomness for the spells (especially in the 2nd year), since they really could turn your whole plan upside down.

While the gameplay is a lot of fun and thematic, the scoring is a bit of a letdown. You get scores (awards) for many things and if you get that one room, which gives you bonus points for each award, you have very good chances to win.

very thematic and looks great.  the game play has got resource management/worker placement however there is a little bit of a bookwork feel to the game especially with two.  if you don't mind that then this game is great fun.  one must determine at best strategy per year but tactically help that strategy each season.  Each decision is very important because there are limited opportunities to get resources to fund certain events.  Has some randomness with the cards but once you play a few times you know what will likely come up.  Since there are only a few real moment of thought, analysis paralysis can some time set in.  So if you like lots of thought then bookwork and then lots of though and then bookwork etc then this is a great game for you.

I think this has the potential to be one of the best games I own - I love the mechanics, both the risk/reward and mind-reading of the action-selection phase and the puzzly nature of the combat, and also like how well the theme is integrated into the game. (I must mention the rulebook in this regard - easily the funniest I have ever read, eclipsing even that of Dungeon Petz, yet without getting annoying. It explains the game pretty well too.)

But I've only ever got to play two-and-a-half games of this, despite owning the game since mid-2012 - all with the "first game" rules. For some reason, my wife and most others in my regular game group didn't like the game - the main complaint seeming to be the arithmetical nature of the combat phase. So I'm very rarely going to get to play this, and have sort of given up trying, especially as there are plenty more games which I love and do get to play.

+ Rules were clearer than Galaxy Trucker rules in my opinion, less was misplayed in the first playthrough of this
+ Still captures some of the hilarious destruction and screw-ups from Galaxy Trucker to an extent
+ The combat system in this game is actually a puzzle and player skill matters. You can make very poor combat decisions unlike some other games were combat isn't as involved
+ Very lighthearted approach to worker placement with a couple of pretty unique twists on the mechanic

- Only annoyance was the reverse order actions on the board  (Monsters and Rooms).

(+) Great fun combining a wicked worker placement (with a serious twist by using the order cards) with a sometimes mind bending puzzle figuring out ways to manage the evilometer to attract the right heros and trying to efficently defeat them during the battles
(+) Magnificent theme: this is a heavy euro-game which really does emerge you in its fantasy-theme
(+) Clever and original gaming mechanics, the game truly feels different
(+) The game is very challenging, but because of this, it is very rewarding to players who manage to pull things off
(+) Very nice artwork

(-) Some components are great quality (wooden pieces, imps, cardboard tunnels, adventurers, monsters, rooms, ...), but the central board and player boards are printed on thin cardboard which doesn't remain flat on the table: such a shame for an otherwise beautifully realized game!
(-) Explaining the game is a time-consuming affair. It takes quite some effort for the one explaining and the new players learning the game
(-) I would have liked the worker placement phase to have lasted a little longer: building up your dungeon is great fun, but there aren't a lot of actions or imps to spend on tunneling, building rooms, buying traps and monsters, and getting a chance to actually get full use of your rooms (as you also need your precious actions to make sure you get extra imps, maintain your monsters and collect gold and manage the evilometer). The expansion 'Festival Season' solves this problem very elegantly.

hard to rate after 1 game cos not got hang of it till end and we messed up a couple of rules

this is a dungeon themed euro game with lots of 2nd-guessing, unexciting 'dungeon' building and brain melting puzzles.

it should be about sending your adventurers against other players cunningly designed fiendishly plotted dungeons...it isnt and the 'titles awarded at game end just serve to balance everything even more than it is in the game

i think it will improve with the next game but still not what i really want - no really tough choices

rating after 2 plays (4players) - 7/8

this is a game about survivial and hardship which i really like - sure there could be more interaction and i dont like the title for 'lord of least efficiency' (most food.gold etc left) but its a pain game and i like that

Typical Czech Games games very much in the style of Galaxy Trucker or Space Alert.  Lots of nice bits and probably closer to Galaxy Trucker if one wants to compare but without the random grab and build element.  This time, building (and staffing your dungeon) is by selecting actions.  Once that is done, it is time to face the rampaging adventurers and see if your dungeon can survive.

Game is designed to be played with exactly four players.  Passable with fewer, but play with 4 if at all possible.

11-03-2014. Rated after one play. Hmm, Vlaada recycles many of the game mechanics from other games, I started noticing after playing Dungeon Lords, after Petz and MK.

In this game you play a dungeon lord, and in 8 rounds you attempt to meet a goal (kill a bunch of adventurers dastardly trying to retire you), while keeping most of your dungeon intact.

The game is FUN! It's a weird kind of fun, since it's a heavy, thinky game. But figuring out what to do in what round is nice. Artwork is ok. Iconography acceptable. This game IMHO would really benefit from a big graphic overhaul and dungeon petz like components..

This game is cool.. and I think a lot of people really can appreciate it for what it does. I see the appeal of the game and I like it.. but just don't want to play it all to often. So, all in all, I think the game is good, but mostly not for me, a 7 rating reflects that best; a 6 is too low for me.

I don't particularly like the math part of calculating the best order to use your traps and monsters to minimize the number of dungeon spaces that flip - I think this could have been streamlined, happen more often but in smaller chunks, have some dice-rolling, etc. to make that part as fun as the worker placement/economy part of the game.

RATING: 6
Rating based on one two-player game. I'm looking forward to another play which I'm sure will change the rating (6).

Update-7/13/16: Played a couple times with 3 players and while this is a well-designed game and can be very interesting (and funny) it feels like a lot of mechanical work. Also because of the nature of the design (and many of Vlaada's designs) it can be fairly anticlimactic. Therefore the players really have to be into the puzzle and into the theme.

Dungeon Petz feels better to play so it finds the table more than Lords. Still, interesting game. Kept the rating at 6.

--Feb2010-- Strange mix of randomness, partial blind bidding, and determinism.  I'm susceptible to some such titles (_Ys_ and _Aladdin's Dragons_ come to mind) but this isn't quite as compelling for my regular game group.  I fear this is destined to be one of those things that I lobby for unsuccessfully.  It's clever, and reasonably pretty, but might languish on the shelf.
--Sep2010-- Traded for _Tales of the Arabian Nights_.

From day one of the the 2009 Essen Hype, I wasn't really all that taken with this game.  1 month later at BGG.Con, I get talked into a game of it and to my surprise, I really ended up enjoying it.

This is 'thinky...' more so than a lot of games I play.  the great thing about this is that the game progresses and you have to concentrate on acquiring the stuff you need to run your dungeon and jokey for position on the evil-meter... all the while picking the things that will match your strategy for defeating the pesky adventurers.

Lots of great decisions to make...  but beware, an AP prone player can add a lot of time to a play of Dungeon Lords.

RATING: 5

Another overhyped Essen novelty.

While playing the combat tutorials, I stumbled for the first of many times over the funny but unclear and disorganized rulebook. I then slowly began to wonder if it is really worth the trouble to try to learn the rules. Being one of Vlaada's "you build up and then the game tries to destroy it" type of game, it spectacularly fails to create dungeon athmosphere, but instead gives dry bookkeeping and fiddly components, like in a lot of economic games. Plus it drags, if not everybody remembers perfectly the many little things you have to know. As somebody else wrote, too much work for an outcome, which highly depends on random factors. 

Pity, after Galaxy Trucker and Space Alert I had high expectations. (Three plays)

This game is an amazing worker placement/resource management game that will kick your ass your first 2-3 plays.  But stick with it!  The strategy and tactics will come to you.  A fantastic game that I both love and hate at the same time.

Also, 4 player only.  Anything less is just...off.

RATING: 8.5
Theme-wise, it is my NUMBER ONE choice. Unlike the traditional game (heroes eliminate evil, justice overcome darkness), this time we play the evil side! It is very tough indeed for the dungeon keeper: you have to pay the tax to the dark bureaucracy, feed your monster, and guard your home against the nosy heroes! Once you're evil enough to draw the attention of the Paladin, you surely have your nightmare. The game is designed to remind people that, the heroes are actually destroying the eco-system of the dungeon. Funny and making a lot of sense actually. The game mechanic is also very unique. The only down side is the teaching part, i think.

The mechanics are typical euro-fare, and the game runs a little long for such a low-interaction piece, but the geeky theme is so well-done and implemented in such an organic way, this should be an example of how to truly blend euro-style with theme. Mass appeal suffers from D&D fear.

A game that is loaded with rules, intricacies, and strategy, so it should be a real chore to play, right? Well, you'd be wrong. The theme is so fun and so present, that the game never feels like work. It just feels like you are a normal dungeon executive, trying to make an honest living in spite of all those annoying adventurers. This is a special game, one of the best heavy Euro-games ever designed. It has tons of personality, and in spite of it's intricate rules, it flows very well. Highly recommended.

*edit* I eventually traded the game away. I was still enjoying it, but I think that for all the rules and complexity the game contains, you actually don't have a lot of say in what happens to you. I tend to really like "experience games" but this is one where the complexity may be too high for what it is. Still, it's good for about five plays.

The humour which surrounds this game is fantastic - and makes the game for me. The theme is clear, funny, and different. The artwork, whilst not to everyone's taste, appeals to me as it has the strange, qurikiness which makes this game stand out as not simply one of the crowd.

Mechanics-wise, the game is deep and engaging relying on clever choices of cards and the balancing of multiple resources and objectives. Not a game for new gamers, perhaps, but a good game nonetheless.

Never was a strategy game so punishing and laid so much waste to your plans as this. Heavy, requires very careful planning and programming of orders requires predicting what other players are likely to do. If you're very lucky and everything goes according to plans, your result goes off the chart. However, something always goes wrong. The randomness is very limited, but you never can fully predict what will happen anyway and can't plan on doing something for sure, you always must have a backup plan. It punishes heavily for every mistake, and sometimes even if you didn't make any. Makes for a very stressful game and definitely not for everyone - you'll either hate it or love it. I love it.

RATING: 5
The theme of this goes out of it's way to be fun and it succeeds. The timing of your purchases here is extremely important and somewhat controllable based on observing the state of the other players and turn order. This game does have player interaction, or observation/reaction. There are penalties throughout the game that influence when and what players will purchase for their dungeons, with the Galaxy Trucker trial at the end to see if your preparations were up to scratch. Wrap it up in a fun dungeon theme with monsters and imps, add a solid card mechanic, present it with nice bits and you have a good game. It's quite long but doesn't feel like it. A good game just for the fun of it that has you wanting to bring it out just one more time because surely you can do better next time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In this game you build and manage a dungeon in order to prevent heroes to conquer it. Players may feel that they have control and that they can plan ahead, but in reality it is pure chaos, at least this was my impression in the first play.  It is hard to follow a strategy and, if you are wise enough to figure one out, its development depends on a double thinking mechanic to asign the actions, in which, in the case of three players, you will not only have to outguess your rivals, but a random draw of cards.  So if you could perform a strategy you are not only clever, but also lucky.  Nevertheless, suprisingly the game is entertaining, funny and challenging enough to leave a good taste despite its flaws.  As usual with Vlaada, it isn't nothing like he have done before, but nice nevertheless, even when his best game is still [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=95&Itemid=1]Prophecy[/url][/i].

When I first read the rules and my wife and I did our first play-through, I thought, "This game hates me. I work to build up stuff, but then it just gets destroyed."

But then I read the rules again (I hadn't missed much, thankfully), and then we played it again. It's wonderful. I no longer think the game hates me. It asks a lot from the players. The rules are fun to read and well thought out, and the graphic design is intuitive and fantastical. But the mechanics don't baby you and coddle you along. You better be ready to pay your taxes. And if you are recruiting a monster, you better be ready for the pay day when it comes up. And did you take on too much evil during the building phase? Well, you better be ready to back it up because you're gonna get attacked a lot.

So a 2nd play was definitely good to help clarify stuff, but also get a better feel for how everything works together. It's a great game that I look forward to playing more.

RATING: 6
Mechanism-wise, I really liked the cardplay, and the fact that you lose the two later cards, but those later cards will often garner you better things.

However...

I felt that the cardplay is the only meaningful and interesting decision I make in the game.

Battles are just mathy puzzles where play seems fairly obvious.

I know this was a first game for two of us, but it still took too long--it's especially annoying that we played for so long but there were only two "battles" in all that time.

And when you do have combat, there are 47 steps to go through. "Wait, the priest can heal, but only damage from attacks that happen this turn? And traps don't count as attacks? Wha?" And the spells are awkward. "Ohhh...what's the next spell?! Wait. It only affects Player C since he's the only one with a wizard; why do I care again? Oh, fatigue, I guess. But fatigue only affects the person in the front of the party? Wha?"

It tries to be both a dungeon crawler and a euro, and it doesn't really succeed at either.

While competition was fierce from the beginning, a sign of a great game is the ability to have a ton of fun while loosing big-time (see Through the Ages).  Even with a light dose of (mis)luck and with what I foresee as even more 'screwage' issues than I at first imagined, these elements add even more color to one of the strongest themed games I've ever played.  Not much else is as fun as building your customized dungeon (flexible enough to dictate a focused strategy) by way of analyzing other lords' and predicting their dastardly moves.  Just as forward-thinking and planning-oriented as other phase-controllers/role-order-predictors like Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy but with an uber-fun WP-puzzle.  I found it to be as interactive as I expected and that wasn't a lot but the room for variants, expansions and other cool goodies is immense.

Excellent worker placement game.  Hits all the right spots with a very well integrated theme.  Intricate mechanics and definitely not for beginners but the combat training at the start of the rulebook is a great way to smooth the learning curve.  Ninety minutes a game is totally doable if there is no AP with experienced players.

Components are very good (see the minion stickers here on BGG to pimp them out).  Item expansion chits were a nice bonus.  I can see this game getting a solid, separate expansion.

Was expecting and hoping for a fantasy themed Galaxy Trucker with the way cool evil dungeon building theme.

Was a little disappointed that wasn't what was hiding inside the box and what was there appeared to be a kinda convoluted beast which seemed intricate and fiddly and hard to follow and understand, albeit with very cool components and really fun artwork.

The first game is definitely very much a learning game, but we had a good rules 'splanation and it started to make sense by the halfway point.

The second game flowed a lot smoother (if you've only had the one crack at it do yourself a favour and revisit it) and all the bits made sense and fit together very nicely.  I can understand why it would be tricky to explain or wrap your head around, but really it does make sense after a bit.  I feel a little gyped that it isn't the zany, light fare that I expected (largely due to the fun and zany theme).  But that's my own fault because what's here is a very good and well designed efficiency/worker placement game with a novel and great theme which has been very well integrated.  But behind the theme there still is a good engine that stands on it's own merits.

There's a fair amount of thinking involved and it'll take you about 2 hours to play.  It's not Galaxy Trucker, but it was never meant to be.

Dungeon Lords has led me to conclude that Vlaada Chvatil and I do not mix (I have also played Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization and Galaxy Trucker). I can appreciate the design and the many original ideas, but they get diluted in a mountain of fiddly procedural rules. Fiddly procedural rules are okay with me if the theme is strong, but the theme is not strong here. Charming and quirky, yes, but it's farming in fantasy clothing (and farming in Agricola isn't even a strong theme to begin with). The decision mechanisms are better and more interesting than that in Agricola, but the painful Adventurer phase is just a pile of procedural crap that's designed to confuse newbies and make them lose (since you basically have to learn a new sub-game only after you realized you didn't prepare adequately through not knowing the nuances of it). Just let me feed two food per head and be done with it.

In keeping with the dungeon-keeper theme, I had a lot more fun, and got into it a lot more, when I unleashed little demons in Claustrophobia. The whole experience was a clunky collection of mechanisms, without theme to glue them together.

This, like other Chvatil games, and a lot of Uwe Rosenberg games, is all about not committing a mistake while you grapple with the rules. Then after you get comfortable and can play mistake-free, you learn nobody else can play like you, or people have already moved on to the next game.

At least this game does not derive replayability from hidden information, unlike Agricola's shameful cards.

This new take on the old Dungeon Keeper PC game is a pretty good game.  Teaching and setup are pretty long - especially the teaching.  The game itself is about two hours with people who generally don't get locked up, but teaching and setup tacks on nearly an additional hour.  Thematically, it works, though an element like the tax man seem a little tacked on.  I like how the tougher heroes go to the most evil DL.  It's a solid, good game, but the long play/teaching time takes some of the punch out of the fun.

I had meant to downgrade this for a while, but had forgotten.  I'm starting to get the feeling that Vlaada's games are not for me.

So, four years after playing this for the first time, I played it again and I have to say that I really appreciated it more the second time around.  I'm not going to say it's my favorite, but it was definitely better than I remember.

Sure, you get a few chuckles from reading the rule book but that's pretty much the extent of the fun. It's a real slog to finish the game: players line up action cards to get stuff to fill their dungeon. After several rounds of this, they battle adventurers.

Repeat again. Winner with most vps (generally those who managed to kill adventurers) wins.

A case of the idea being more fun than the execution. Lacks the spark and 'fun' factor of Galaxy Trucker and Originality of Space Alert.

I quite enjoy the action selection worker placement in this game where first in is not always good and hidden information creates much of surprises and tension. But the rest of the game i.e. Fighting against heroes, various spells and effects. Different type of monsters. Different traps and how they work and end game scoring where you go each categories seem very gamey and unnecessary complicated for this type of game. You need repeated plays in short time for all the rules to be not an issue anymore and then maybe this will be fun 90min game, but not sure if I'll get there.

A worker placement game that feels in many ways like Caylus, and (to me at least) even more like Agricola. The game is played for eight rounds and after round four and eight there is a battle.

Though being a little heavy on the rules side designing your dungeon and repelling those pesky adventurers is really quite interesting and fun.

Very good worker-placement game double-guessing game. But like any Vlaada game it has steep learning curve, and this game I suppose the most difficult one to teach to new players (especially the fight rules). Training missions do help, but it's rare occasion that new players have enough time and commitment to spare this much time to learn new game.

This game is awesome with the right group, and by that I mean a group that all knows the rules and plays it often enough to remember them each time it is brought to the table.  That really doesn't describe my group...

That being said, when I do find that right opportunity to play it, the game is a blast.  It truly is brain-wracking, chaotic bliss.  This game is probably the most punishing I've played, even over In the Year of the Dragon and Galaxy Trucker, and every moment of it is enjoyable.

Worker placement, Economic, Planning. Wow, solid game. Don't be fooled by the name/theme - this is a tight Euro game through and through.

Update: bumped up the rating another half point after another play. Brutal, tight Euro game; possibly the most fun you'll ever have getting kicked in the nuts, repeatedly.

I finally got to play this for the first time this week (4/1/13) and had a good time. There is a lot to the game and a lot to take in on a first play, and we were using the expansion, as well. I like the worker placement aspect mixed with the dungeon building. I made a few costly errors during the game that definitely set me back, but now that I understand the game better, next time will show a much better score. This is definitely a game you will want to play a couple of times to get the hang of. 

Just like in Galaxy Trucker, there is a little bit of a puzzle element to this game in figuring out how best to use your dungeon resources (traps and monsters) to eradicate the pesky adventurers coming in to destroy it. I like this, but it can get thinky (a good thing)!

This is getting a tentative 7 for now. There is certainly potential for this one to move up a bit with more plays.

I really like the thinking involved in this.  In some ways there is a lot of chaos, but unlike many chaotic games I've played, in this one there is actual a feeling of being able to control the chaos to your bidding if you are careful about how you place your orders.  

I have played this as both a 2-player and 4-player game, and I think it's worth purchasing for either.  They do play different, and have different strategies due to the way the 2-player "dummy" players work, but it still has the overall trying to outthink your opponent that still makes it a tense game.

In my opinion this is a excellent game. It has high quality components and beautiful artwork. One of the best written game manuals that I have read so far. The gameplay is good to. No replayability  issues so far for me. The only downside is that it takes a while to explain the game to new players.

Gonosz, kazamatákat birtokló és azokat szörnyekkel és csapdákkal telepakoló, hősöket becsalgató, majd azokat legyilkoló hadurak versenye. 
Ismét egy számítógépes adaptációról van szó. A Dungeon Keeper sokak kedvence játéka volt. A megvalósítás itt is kiemelkedő. A játék kellően összetett és nagyon izgalmas. Nagyon szép a játék kivitelezése, elég sötét, jól hozza a komor hangulatot. Érdekes a gonosz szerepébe bújni és a hős kalandorokat eltenni láb alól. Ebben a játékban mindenki kiélheti a gonoszságát.

Great game with multiple, complex strategies and problem solving elements.

The rulebook, while entertaining to read, is cumbersome and complex.  It takes a good 1/2-3/4 hour just to explain to someone how to play.  This makes it a game you can't just pull out for new gamers.  (NOT a gateway game).  However, for a seasoned gamer, it is a delight and mechanically a joy.

Wow. Another Vlaada masterpiece.  I think this will rocket up my Top 10 list once I get some more plays in.  So far I can see a lot of parallels to Agricola here.  I hope Vlaada is already planning a big expansion for it.

Update: moved my rating down a touch.  I don't think this one will make it to my top 10 as is.  It is already getting a little stale with all the same monsters and rooms every game.  Again, it is really begging for an expansion.

RATING: 10
2/22/15 8.8 - This is great theme on a fun puzzly game.  The build-up to the adventurers coming into your dungeon is a lot of fun while also being tense.  I really enjoyed our first full game, and would gladly have played another year (as happens with the expansion).  I'm super curious about how it plays with 3 or 4.  It might be my favorite game right now, but i'll slot it just under summoner wars until i can play a few more times.

The game play is a bit fiddly, but the excellent theme makes up for that.

One concern is that I can also see how one screw up can really hose a player over, and might ruin their game - all their best plans down the drain.  Will have to see whether the enjoyment of the game can overcome that when it happens.

6/6/2015 10 - Only my second 10.  So far i have found every game to be totally absorbing.  Hard to imagine getting tired of this one soon; i would love to play it back-to-back-to-back.  And it isn't always obvious who is winning, and I have seen some comebacks from bad starts, so runaway leader isn't usually a problem.  Occasionally, it is pretty clear by 3rd season of 2nd year that someone is out of it.

To me, this is the perfect combo of euro mechanics fit exactly to a great theme.  I definitely prefer the 4 player game, and the 10 rating is really with that player count.  As a 2 player, i like it, but it would still top out around 8.8.

The main downside is that it is a 4 player game, and sometimes we have extra people.  

8/7/15 very slight adjustment to 9.5.  Occasionally the game will pick someone out and beat them down mercilessly, making it not a very fun game for them.

12/4/17 back up to 10.  i have played this so many times in person and online, and it is still my favorite game.  I can't imagine another game getting this much attention from me and still being something I greatly look forward to.  

Only caveat is that it really does require 4 people who know the game to enjoy, and I am lucky to have that.  2 and 3 player count are still good games, but wouldn't be a 10, more like an 8.

RATING: 5
Nice enough parallel play engine game, but really I've just about reached my limit on these kinds of games.  I like what they did with it, but the theme is only in the text and art.  Honestly, this could have just as easily have been about a barbarian horde in medieval europe or weeds in your garden.  Yes, it is cool that it isn't, but that only goes so far when you expect something so daring.

It is an elaborate multiplayer solitaire game again. Where interaction is reduced even further than the traditional Princes of Florence model by creating blind programing of actions (effectively blind worker placement).  While intuiting things is fun and all, it insures that there just isn't much reason for other players to be there.

I've got to say with all of these solitaire worker placement/drafting efficiency games coming out I'm really starting to miss the days of bidding for everything.

The longer I stay away from this the less interested I am in going back.  It just seemed like too much work for a long dry mathy puzzle.  It seems especially strange to compare the results of people's actions to one another to determine a winner when so much of what happens to you in particular is random and completely inconsequential of what other players are doing.

Oh yeah, the imps are cool.

Here come the heroes, go my minions!  Dungeon Lords has one of the best themes - it is wickedly fun to slay the foolhardy adventurers who enter your dungeon.

I did not like the fact that the heroes could not wipe out your whole dungeon, but simply mess it up a little.

With just one play, I'm not sure I'm qualified to talk about the merits of the game.

I was surprised that I didn't dislike Dungeon Lords. I'm not normally a fan of worker placement, and that's half the game. Nor do I love optimization puzzles, which is the other half. But the theme weaves together the complex ruleset so I can look past the design and enjoy the experience. Scoring, however, is so abstract, so balancing, that it's hard to know what a winning strategy is, let alone how to pursue it. Winning feels arbitrary.

Finally got this played... it was a starter game, so no events to completely destroy us. Even so, the adventurers were still quite challenging, and I eventually won due to my having invested in a couple of awesome monsters in year 2.

1 partial game

The rules are pretty straightforward, but it took a LONG time to actually get through them! But basically, the game goes like this:
- you go through 2 years, each with 4 seasons.
- Each season, you send your workers out using 3 cards, 2 of which will be unavailable to you next season. The cards are resolved one by one, in turn order -- you place your minion in the matching action area; but in a 4er game, only 3 spaces are available.
- After all workers are placed, each is resolved -- usually in order of placement but occasionally reverse. Spaces give you various things (e.g., food, money, tunnels, rooms, monsters), usually at different costs depending on order of arrival to action space. You are building a dungeon on your player board, and acquiring traps and monsters to defend it.
- At the end of 3 of the seasons, you deal with an event (e.g., pay for monsters again) and also allocate the randomly drawn adventurers -- the weaker ones go to the nicer players (lower on the Evilometer). 
- At the end of each year, the adventurers go through your dungeon: use your traps and monsters to try to fend them off ("capture" them) through up to 4 rounds of combat. Each round they survive, they conquer part of your dungeon.
- After the 2nd year, you get VP for a variety of things (e.g., size/composition of dungeon, monsters, position on Evilometer); most VP wins!

A cool, different take on worker placement! Very puzzle-y: figure out the best way to use your traps/monsters. But also get into everyone else's head a bit: which action are they going to choose, and when? You want to optimize both your action choice and order or placement (programmed orders) to try to get the best version of the action you want. And you would like to jockey for position on the Evilometer to get the adventurer you can handle, too. I suspect all this is beyond me, but I do look forward to trying the full game some time!

Thus far my favourite Vlaada game, though only two plays on which to base my preliminary rating.  I hope my rating stays consistent or goes up; I fear it will plummet.  There are aspects to Dungeon Lords I'm not typically fond of (symbols, game actively attacking you, incredibly tight and unforgiving accounting), but somehow it works and is fun for me so far.

We will see what additional plays bring.

RATING: 9
This is an excellent, almost sort of tower-defense game.  If you have ever played the small card game Boss Monster, imagine that but with a lot more depth and meat on the bones.

In this game each player is the lord of their own dungeon.  Using worker placement mechanics each player will spend each round gathering resources and using these resources to stock their dungeon with traps, monsters, and special rooms to combat against adventurers who will traipse through dungeons in an attempt to conquer our homes.

The action selection is done really well.  Each player has a hand of 10 cards however two of those are unusable each round and often being the first one to get to an action space is the worst position to be in but being too late and there might not be space for you at that action at all.  There is a lot of deduction and mind games to try and work it out so you get the best spot at the different action spaces.

I also really like the "evilometer" mechanic.  The strongest heroes will always go after the most evil dungeon lord.  You gain evil through various actions and hiring certain monsters but you can also reduce this amount.  The game is completely full of flavor and theme in fact and I love that the rulebook describes thematically all of the game effects and they all actually make sense.  Combining rich theme with complex original mechanics has always been something Chvatil does better than pretty much anybody else I think.

Fair warning, this game is mean.  It is equal-opportunity mean though and the game is more about managing and mitigating the amount of smacking around you take rather than eliminating it altogether because I'm not sure it is possible.  In my first play I couldn't pay my taxes (that's right, you have pay taxes twice during this game) and ended up taking a 12 point hit due to it.  I had 9 points at the end of the game and the winner had 20.  That's right, if I could have paid my taxes I would have won by 1 point.  Talk about getting beat up...and I'm still excited to play again.

Not at all what the artwork might make you think it is, and nothing like the video game it's supposedly based on. Very much a worker management game with a light Dungeon theme thrown on for good measure. Manual is funny in many areas, but very impractical for actually learning the game.

The humor aside, actually requiring the owner to play through a demo game to learn the thing is just not a very practical approach, particularly when one has a large gaming group and needs to teach it on a semi-regular basis.

I'm not much into fantastic themed games. I'm more like a serious player who occasionally can play one of these kinds of game. Dungeon Lords it's not my number one choice for anything: I find the boards and ll the gaming materials too noisy. I think strategy is very much weaker than luck and I guess the time of play and, above all, the interactivity are both poor. Disclaimer: time of play could be under the 2 hours which can happen with experienced players.

The way players can choose their actions is interesting. Nothing new here but I like this particular mechanic. Knowing better the people we are playing with is a good advantage because Dungeon Lords has this guessing characteristic. The position to place your workers is very important.

I didn't find the "being a bad guy" thing a good advantage. In fact I think players who make a conservative play are better rewarded than the ones who don't. And I'm not sure if I like that in the game. I tend to enjoy better, games that reward aggressive and innovative strategies, although I admit I'm not usually one of those players.

I will play this game from time to time but I won't be playing it very often. I found it fun enough to deserve the table occasionally.

A Chvátil game through and through, this game will leave you with the highest highs and the lowest lows.  No one in my group ends the game with an average score.  Either a player does well or gets crushed.  This might be what brings our group back for sessions so often.  No one ever feels like they have this game mastered.

This game introduces a great inference spin on worker placement that is most enjoyable with 4 players.  The evil track accompanied by the paladin hero, this game's risk/reward mechanism, adds greatly to the theme.  The random event card also adds the right amount of tension to the game's rounds.  As with other Chvátil games, resource management in Dungeon Lords presents a great challenge.

I love the expansion rules added to the original game for free.  I only subtract two-points from this game's rating because the "title" bonus scoring room skews the final point total and outcome of the game to greatly.

RATING: 6
I was exited about the theme of this game but it really left me wanting.  There is a worker placement phase where you place your markers to acquire dungeon resources, such as, imps, gold, traps, and monsters, then and action phase, where a band of meddling do-gooders try to conquer your dungeon.  I felt like I had to guess what I was to need in the placement phase and hope it was good enough in the action phase.  The lack of control left me un-exited in the end.   It seemed like a grand idea but the game is stuck between whimsical and serious and it ended up getting halfway to each. I'd try it again.

LOVE the theme.  The game seems to balance very well, and is always close.  There's good opportunities for strategy in this game.  Must have exactly 4 players though.  Others I play with think the game is too random.

Update:  I'm lowering the rating on this since it takes way too long to get a new person up to speed on this game.  The game mechanics are really cumbersome, and hard to wrap your head fully around.  The scoring is also really hard to wrap your head around, and takes like 20 plays to really understand the mechanics and scoring enough to play well.  Even after many plays, I still make mistakes in planning combat, resolving combat, and planning my bidding.  I still stand by my love of the theme, and think it's a good strategic game with meaningful tough decisions to be made.

I have been on fire recently taking chances buying games I had not played yet. Dungeon Lords is instantly one of my favorites, with the added bonus that it has engaged everyone I've taught it to as well.

Surprisingly easy to teach, as long as you pass along a lot of the humor that comes out of the rules as prsented in the rulebook. For instance, telling the players that Priests are basically jerks who hate their jobs and, thus, only heal when combat occurs and they won't forget.

Can't wait for every play.

What a game. It really strucks you. Its so hard and everything is a pain, but with so great fun and theme.

The simultanious action selection is one of my favorite mechanics and this game gives that such a new flavour. I love it.

RATING: 6
Much of the charm of dice in RPGs comes down to the surprise. You're in it for a good time and a good story, so what you're going to remember are the natural 20s that get spun into bizarre, unlikely successes ("and that's how the halfling killed the dragon with a banana"), or the 1s that turn a sure thing into a pratfall. The worst thing that can happen is easy, dull progression.

Dungeon Lords is euro-strategy worker placement that uses hidden information to much the same effect. Players build up their dungeons (tunnels, rooms, guardian monsters, traps) to try and defeat the heroes who come adventurin' twice during the game. But actions are chosen by pre-programming (players simultaneously choose where their three workers will go) and first in to a given location isn't necessarily best dressed. There is a very good chance of not getting what you want.

Payoffs are uneven, and position on the evilometer is crucial: which heroes players attract depends on their level of evil (and the evilest run the risk of attracting the attention of a paladin), but different heroes also require different rooms, traps and monsters to defeat. Small differences can go a long way.

It's a clever design, with wonderful theme, but I'm not convinced that the whole is better than the sum of its parts. It's a genre I just don't understand,  part agonized second-guessing and part crapshoot, but not really in a push-your-luck kind of way; it's too much a strategy game for that. I suppose the target audience is the fan of Welcome to the Dungeon who thinks it would be improved by 90+ minutes of worker placement. 

I don't want a lot of "fun" surprises in my strategy games, but that's basically what the game is about: the game tries its best to hurt you and at one point or another it manages it. There is a lot of hidden information and a lot of points swinging on minor differences -- and it doesn't take much in a game where a winning score can easily be less than 30 points.

RATING: 7
Like many complex resource management games, it takes a play or two to grasp the strategy, and then luck of cards and guessing your opponents' strategies become the deciding factors.  The icons on the cards are not as difficult to read as in some games.  The theme is cute and builds a little urgency, because you can often see what is coming and try to prepare for it.

Great theme play.  fairly easy game to learn and play, but need a few plays to pick-up the strategies.  Game play is challenging, definitely a gamer's game.  Has a eurogame part where players gather resources and prepare for battle.  Also has an amerigame part where the players pit their dungeons against a party of heroes.  The components are excellent - mounted boards and thick cardboard chits with very nice artwork, plastic and wood tokens.  The rule book is well written and organized and has many game play tips.  Game length is good at around 2 hours.  One of my favorites!

[2 plays] Initial Reaction Rating.  Overall it felt like an interesting deep game.  Kind of surprising how deep the game is given the theme.  I would like to try this game more and get into the strategy more.  There is enough rules and things going on it was hard to really play with any strategy in my first game.  Really along the same lines while I did find the game interesting it did not feel really elegant or polished.  There was a lot of rules and complexity.  My second play was more fun than the first time.  I think I understood what to do more and felt more in control of what was going on.

RATING: 7
[Z-man games 2010 edition] {Dungeons; programming, tile-laying; optimal 4p}  Dungeon Lords is a thematic game.  Even though it comes with attractive game components, it is only suitable for experience players because of the difficult decisions and tight resources.  Essentially it is a resource management game - players have to use their resources (Imp, food, gold, evil) carefully to build a dungeon and score.

It is a multi-faceted game.  However, this is only a tactical game due to the random draw of monster tiles, room tiles, adventurers, event cards.   It is quite hard to fix a strategy in first 2 rounds and stick to it.  Players have to adjust their tactics as the game runs.  Limited mixture of monsters and rooms is one problem - which makes the game less dynamic and luck (the timing when a monster appear can be quite significant).

It is a good 2p / 3p game - esp. players have more controls in this situation.  However, with 4 experienced gamers, Dungeon Lords is very fun and very brain-burning.

It is an interactive game.  There are many competitions on resources and actions.  And, forcing another player to take a strong adventurer is fun.  It is not easy to teach Dungeon Lords as there are many fiddly rules and the complexity of game flow.  Players may need to try 1 or 2 turns to experience the game.

A typical game runs around 1.5 hour.  Very good.  I would recommend this game to most players.

The game components are top notch.  The tiles may wear fast upon multiple plays.  The illustration is attractive and informative.  The Imps are cute.  The boards are nicely design and comes with good player aids.

Rating of 6 after my first game. The theme is brilliant and very hilarious.
I am wondering, however, wether there is actually much strategic thinking involved. It seems as if the game turns out a bit "chaotic" despite your personal plans.

Very challenging, arduous and unforgiving.

RATING: 8
Building a dungeon requires balancing a lot of different resources with a tricky action selection mechanic that requires some good planning in advance and careful attention to what the other dungeon lords are up to.

This game is not for the faint of heart; its on the heavier side, and can be quite nasty at times.  It isn't as complicated as it sounds though, and the visual cues on the board are really well done, as are the aids to teaching.

I really enjoy the gameplay.  Its thought intensive and at the same time dripping with amusing theme.

On the downside, when played with two players I find it intensely frustrating. Not with 3 or 4; just 2.

RATING: 8
Fun game, but seems to have more rules exceptions than rules. I am hoping a few more plays will indicate why certain actions occur in reverse order, or why you get X for doing action Y first versus second etc. I assume it's a key part of the design to have things run this way.

I think this is only one of a very few games I own where I am quite confident I will never, ever play it 100% correctly. Each individual rule is probably there to perfectly balance the game, but there are so many rules that it becomes impossible to remember them all.

Fun theme, happy to play.  Blind action selection but some information available.  A little luck in the traps you get and in the spells, but can be mitigated, by looking a head, trying to not get wizards or killing them off.

I heard the opinions: "Pure chaos". I understand them - the game is not intuitive and you need more than a single play to catch its nuances. But, I don't share these opinions at all! If you devote some time to go into DL details, the game starts to shine. While it's the euro-game, the theme is built in very well. And the battles with adventurers... - very tasty. 
Many decisions needed: to be more evil and attract the paladin or to take easy guys having better reputation? How to plan your actions to have a good profit and not to be stuck in the next rounds? But it's not obvious - you should observe others, check the order of the events (pay day, taxes), rooms available. There are also many details that you should remember about - if you forget, the "impression of chaos" can be strong...

In addition: incredible graphics, fantastic rulebook. 

Number of plays: 7.

RATING: 7.5
This one gets a 7 for playing, a bonus point for atmosphere, and another bonus point for giving you finally a sound excuse of being an evil dungeon lord, recruiting monsters and stuff to kick the crap out of goodygoody adventurers. Yes, you could bring out HeroQuest, D&D, Spacehulk or DOOM! but you'd be the only one chuckling and having devious plans, and no one to show them to.

In this game, you'll all be chuckling and anticipating the other person's slaughter almost as much as your own devious plans. Great game if you like being the evil overlord. And as you're on the Geek, I assume you have that ambition.

[Edit: other great games make I don't suggest this as first game anymore (though I still enjoy it). Therefore rating down to 7.5]

"Like a fun version of Agricola"

(With slightly more interaction, more screwage and a much more satisfying theme)

Update: Dungeon Lords has remained endlessly replayable and I've now played it enough to be able to examine it in some depth. The game remains huge amounts of its charm and rewards good play, but still has enough unpredictability to present a challenge to experienced players.

The downside, as with all Vlaada games, is that the rules all have to be taught upfront and so there is a huge front loading of learning before you can play.

Rating up from 8.5 to 9.

RATING: 7
A good "euro game". In addition to ressource management, you have the combat rules - which makes the whole game quite complex.
It is actually far more complex than I thought it would be. Because of the theme and style, I expected an easy and light hearted game, with about the same level of "complexity" that games like Munchkin have.
The illustrations look funny and the rules are full of jokes, which makes it easy to have the wrong first impression of the game. For this reason, my first game of Dungeon Lords was quite unsatisfying, as I had "wrong" expectations. With my second game, I knew what I would be up to - and I enjoyed the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like Dungeon Lords.  It's got quite a learning curve to it though.  And is definitely 100% not in the gateway category.  But it gives an interesting worker placement mechanic for discovering who gets to do what actions in the dungeon.

Ed: In the end, It has dropped over time.  If I'm playing this game with 3 other people (Read: I'll play it 4 player only) who know how to play the game already.  I'd sit down and have a blast.

But I will never, ever teach this game to someone again.  It's just too much like work, and then the game you play just won't be all that much fun because they are still trying to piece it together.

At first I was excited for it, then all these reviews came in from people saying that it wasn't what they expected so I became more cautious and almost didn't pick it up.  However some birthday money came my way and we played our first game and I REALLY enjoyed it.  Yes it is more euro but I still think the theme worked with the game and it was solid in its own right.  Agonizing decisions and occasional lock outs because you risked something hoping to get that third slot.

Continued plays continue to improve my opinion - even though I am getting a worse score each time I play  :)

RATING: 6.5
I found the really first play through the first half of the game tedious, boring and sort of confusing, but after the first attack I found it extremely enjoyable.  It is certainly a daunting game for new players and has a learning curve/slow pace when first learning with people that detracts from their enjoyment.

Granted this is a review of one play, but as many have said, I loved dungeon keeper so I really got into the theme. Mechanically its plenty solid, there's alot going on and a fair amount of balancing and thinking required as the game relies on the possibility of you choosing the wrong actions, or sequence at a given time.  Because there's so much going on its a VERY fiddly game, but once you get the hang of it the play is pretty fast.  I think it has potential to be good, but it requires multiple plays to reach that point.  There's lots of fun options that can come up. I like the little details on the hero's as they gain levels and the board itself.  I will say this though, the minion figure is a T-rex head, I don't care what anyone says.  Box art could be better, but that's pretty minor when it comes to a pretty frustrating but enjoyable game.  The box interior is total fail however, especially with so many cards/chits/markers so it loses points there, nothing worse than getting a giant hole to stick your stuff and having to reorganize it every time you want to play.

It loses half a point for having really crappy chits that sometimes rip even when your carefully punching them out.

The theme is definitely not for me, but I love this game so much that I'm actually starting to love the theme. Rules weren't a piece of cake, but after studying them and playing once or twice, they seem so obvious that I don't get what was so difficult in the first place. Maybe it will come back to me if I try to teach them to a new player... :)

I like it when you have to think and make decisions. Dungeon Lords is definitely that. Some uncertainty in the game bothers me though. You don't have time to spy all battle cards of the round and your opponents choices require lots of guessing too. 

Reading the rules was a blast , funny demon and minion.

I love the theme of this game, which is the defense of a dungeon from the bad guy's point of view.  Despite the funny rulebook and art, this is a fairly complex game.  It's fairly easy to botch the timing of your defense, which will allow the pesky adventurers to come smashing through, which can be frustrating.  Vlaada has another winner.

My first instinct to rate it a bit higher than Dungeon Petz. It's SUPERFUN, but it's more of a thematic experience than most Vlaada games, but as always there is meat to it too -- the simultaneous worker placement mechanism is an incredibly brilliant idea.

EDIT: the insane barrier to entry is keeping it from hitting the table...

[i][size=18]Defending your lair against Adventurers since 2009[/size][/i]

I had actually played this once as a 2 player game about 7 years ago and didn't enjoy my play a whole lot.  But playing it again as a 4 player game, I really enjoyed it.  Dungeon Keeper was one of my favorite computer games growing up, so I love the theme of building a dungeon and fighting against heroes.  The mechanics are also pretty interesting with the way that you have to guess what other people are going to do.

I've played many games of [thing=97207][/thing], which I love, and I always thought it was a much better game than Lords.  But, now I'm not convinced.  Petz also has a very amusing theme and interesting mechanics, but it can also be pretty swingy with regard to which cards you draw.  Lords felt a lot less random.

Either way, it's a solid game and reaffirms Vlaada as my favorite designer.  I'd love to play this again soon.

Great theme and very cool bits. I love that there are difficult choices throughout. I like that players must be planning many turns in advance, and considering many, many factors as they do so. Given the length, it's a bit frustrating that luck of the draw (especially with traps and spells, but in other spots, as well) can sometimes tank a lot of careful preparation ... but that can be kinda humorous, as well. A "7" rating for now, but that may change. I think if this speeds up to the advertised time of 90 minutes or less with experienced players, it may go up in my ratings. If it continues to veer into two-hour-plus territory, it'll probably head the other way. Update: The set-up length and - even more so - the time and effort requited to teach this game - have relegated it to an unused corner of the game shelf. I still love the theme and enjoy the worker-placement aspect of the game, but it just doesn't get played. Rating dropped to a 6.

Dungeon Lords is the most successful Euro approach to a dungeon crawl.  Multiple mechanisms mesh together into one tightly-balanced experience where no-one knows the winner until the last second.

After my first two plays, maybe I am in an odd state of infatuation.  Hard to say.  I really like the game.  I have read all kinds of statements, opinions, ideas, whatever about Dungeon Lords.  So I'll try to put down my own ideas, without much subjectivity.

First off, its hard to not be drawn to the game if slick presentation is your thing.  The boards, quite busy and overloaded, are attractive.  The game, all laid out, just looks cool, if not a bit hyperactive.  

Second, it is a ton of stuff to understand on your first play.  There is a pile going on, almost like two games in one, with worker placement first, then a hard to understand battle sequence following.  It all is pressed together in quite a frenetic package that is a bit overwhelming upon initial approach.

And it can be killer hard.  Not dense, but more tough to go anywhere.  The game really can beat you up.  But at least I have found that I still really enjoy playing.  

So my early analysis is that I like Dungeon Lords.  It is a great attempt at bringing a more interesting theme together with the worker placement genre (I am on record saying I'm sick of castles, kingdoms, and other exercises of antiquated dryness).  Its not revolutionary, airtight, or perfect.  But it is a whole lot of fun.

Intricate, puzzly, thematic Chvatil goodness.  I love it, but getting it to the table has proven difficult.  Kind of a beast to teach, even though the payoff is just fantastic.

Probably too fiddly to ever be one of my top-tier games (if I don't forget a key rule, someone else will, and it's likely they'll complain about it) but it's a rollicking good time and one I hope I get to play more than I have so far.

Solid game, little hard to pick up after an extended time away from it. While the mechanics are easy enough to pick up it's a little tricky to remember the "strategy" of the game unless it sees the table more frequently than it currently does.

Interesting game.  Played twice. It doesn't feel like you have much influence over the course of the game, but I strongly suspect that that is just my inexperience with the game.  Looking forward to playing again.

RATING: N/A
This game is a worker placement that is made extremely complex for the sake of being so. The theme is wonderful and full of fun, but actually teaching this and truly understanding how everything works is just a nightmare. Why would I want to play this when I could play Caverna, Agricola, Tzolkin, or Caylus instead? They are just as heavy and strategic but I don't get a migraine learning the rules or how combat works.

Two completely different, fun games easily coexisting in one game.  The rules overhead is very high to make it all work, but you can't deny it is entertaining.

I especially like the puzzle of defeating the hero. Is there another game that has something like this? I'd love to try it.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 1


Overall - 1

Fun stuff, but I want to play about twice as much game in the amount of time it takes to play this.  That's different than wanting it to take half as long.  I want Marathon Dungeon Lords to only last two hours.  Another one of those games that I only want to play with experienced players because teaching games are agonizing.

Latest Vlaada game. Based around the theme of the Dungeon Keeper PC game, players compete to build a dungeon and build up stocks of monsters and traps to throw at parties of adventurers that come into the dungeon trying to conquer tunnels and rooms as they come to it. The inital build up phase is fiddly, but the puzzle-like figuring out how to line up your monsters and traps optimally to kill (capture?) the adventurers early. Might go up further if the resource phase is less fiddly upon further plays.

Fundamentally, the game simply isn't ever as interesting in normal play as the training examples are, the random magic makes planning near useless.

I'd buy this if someone came up with a book of puzzle-scenarios for it, though.

This is a stunning piece of game design.  It's insanely creative, the economics of the game are so tight it may induce a migraine.  The theme fits perfectly, the mechanics are rock solid and understandable.  The game is harsh and unforgiving. Ideal only for 4 players, but the game is flawless.

This game is fantastic. I loved Dungeon Keeper on the PC and it makes a transition to board game form surprisingly well. It is a fun worker placement game where every decision is grueling. Vlaada is my favorite designer and this game is another reminder of why.

RATING: 8
A Vlaada Euro through and through. The rule book is a hoot to read and does a stellar job of laying out the game.
It's fiddly to set up and tear down but all of the extra bits don't slow down gameplay. The playtime has a good feel to it, you become invested in your dungeon and the turn-by-turn tactics are crunchy and interesting.

Fun art, creative mechanisms, and a very unique theme. It's rather daunting to teach but fairly simple once you dive in. This looks like a keeper!

RATING: 8
Amazing theme, hilarious rule-book.  Takes worker placement to "the next level" with imperfect information.  The dichotomy between the game's two very different phases - simultaneous worker placement vs. effectively single-player puzzle - is perhaps a little jarring, especially since the puzzle-solving can take a long time depending on a player's position and personality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A cute game with a funny theme and some quite interesting mechanics. I absolutelly love the worker placement part and the theme works miracles. Preparing for combat is most fun.

The battles-riddles are less elegant and somewhat fiddly. I also find it irritating that it is designed strictly for 4 players, with any less seriously hurting the experience.

In the end, although it takes time to play through the game, it leaves you unsatisfied as you don't devote much to each game part. It's like they made a bunch of very good mechanics, brilliantly mixed them all together, and because the end result was a huge game, decided to artificially cut it in half. Or a third.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The biggest negative about this game is its poor scalability with varying numbers of players.  You basically have to play the game with 4, or the random mechanic used to imitate a "ghost" player starts hindering gameplay.  As a vlaada fan, I love basically everything else about this game - the theme is integrated almost effortlessly with the mechanics, which are solid on their own.  Good game.  It does take a long time to set up and to play, however, which is why I didn't score it higher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The logic puzzle of managing what you have collected, organizing your traps, and sequencing which order to defeat your adventurers makes the title shine.  The choices of holding back a monster to prevent healing, leading the adventurers into a room or a hallway, picking which adventurer to attack, and ordering the traps to maximize damage.  This could become automatic in a few plays, but I think if that happens the central board play will develop more.  

The first time we played it took 4 hours including set up, clean up, and rules.  The second and third games clocked in at 100 minutes including set up/take down.  

This game always sits on my brain after its played.  The evilometer is a fun fun thing.  It requires players to remain relatively close to at least one other player to help aim for the adventurers they want, unless of course they feel lucky then they will go off on their own.  The paladin is a fun mechanic, and easily avoided in most games unless you choose to bring him over because the paladin is worth almost 2 adventurers.  The central board play is neat, because you need to be scanning your opponents boards.  Its frequently a game of chicken, because the 2nd and 3rd spots are frequently more valuable, but if the play is so obvious all 4 players will place there and you will be shut out with nothing to show for it.  The board is larger and getting shut out is less prevalent than I thought it would be after reading the rules, and one must put effort into getting 2nd and 3rd spots.  Keeping flexibility of resources while accruing a dangerous dungeon seems like the main difficulties I am currently facing. 

The game is a chore to teach, but fortunately simultaneous action selection works best with regular opponents in my opinion, so the difficulty teaching is negated somewhat.  I like it a lot right now, as it has parts of playing the system and playing off of the players.  Its my kind of game.

Truly envious of the design.  It is bulky at first, but after the second and third plays the rules are quite intuitive and consistent.  I'm not sure which rule I would change, because despite its "bulk", every exception and rule is not added for flavor but it increases the decisions and the worth of your choices.

I believe maintaining flexibility far outweights short term efficiency in the central board play.  Once you "need" any currency, you will be screwed.

I revisted this after having it on the shelf for awhile.  It is fiddly, but it holds up.

TRADED AWAY (4/17/10) --- I want to like this game so much. I keep playing it again and again in the hope that I'll see the light. I'm up to 7 plays now (at every possible player count) and I'm ready to throw in the towel and give up. I really enjoy and highly respect a lot of Vlaada's games (particularly Galaxy Trucker, Through the Ages, and Prophecy), and I was really looking forward to Dungeon Lords, but its time to swallow the bitter pill of disappointment and move on. Dungeon Lords is a game that is too cumbersome for its own good. It is caught in the no man's land between Galaxy Trucker and Through the Ages, both excellent games in very different ways. I get bogged down in Dungeon Lords and can't enjoy the game. I enjoy the fast and loose gameplay of Galaxy Trucker, as well as the slow and thoughtful gameplay of Through the Ages, but Dungeon Lords feels as if it wants to have the fun of Galaxy Trucker along with the complexity of Through the Ages, and it's a mismatch, at least for my brain. Vlaada says that it's a game that works well for his group of friends, and I very much believe him. The chaos of the simultaneous action selection in Dungeon Lords might work well for a group that played it together a lot, but for someone looking for an occasional game with different groups of people, it's very unpredictable and frustrating (with severe penalties for incorrectly predicting your opponents' plans). I had initially hoped that the cumbersome nature of the game and the maintenance throughout the various phases would work more smoothly after playing the game many times, but after 7 plays I find myself still waiting. It's not the complexity that puts me off, since I love games like Die Macher and Antiquity, but rather the complexity combined with the randomness, theme, components, and feeling of the game. It just feels like a mismatch that I can't quite get past, and can't seem to find the game very fun. The game is constantly tripping over itself and pulling you in different directions with its seemingly conflicting goals and methods of achieving those goals. All that being said, I know when I'm having fun playing a board game, and this one just isn't fun.

This is a great game that can suffer from 2 things:

1 - It can take a long time to play;

2 - It sure is hard to understand the battle phase.

Still, Dungeon Lords is fun, tense, colorful, clever, thematic. It can be hard on new players (not so much the work placement part, but the fight at the end of each year), but I liked it from game 1. It is an amazing game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Got this because I liked my other two Vlaada games (TtA and Graenaland) and because of a possible similarity to In the Year of the Dragon with periodic impending disasters: In this case, adventurers trying to raid the dungeon you're building.

So, the rulebook starts you out with four combat training scenarios that are literally puzzles to solve, as they have no randomness. I found that fun, even though I normally don't like puzzles. I thought it would end up being relatively tolerable because there would be no guarantee that naturally-occurring combat scenarios would even [i]have[/i] a solution per se.

The game is divided into two "years." Each year consists of four rounds of trying to draft three actions at a time, followed by a combat phase where adventurers show up to each player's dungeon, and spend four rounds trying to fight their way in. I feel like there isn't enough of either half for the game to feel substantial.

When drafting your three actions, you're basically blindly programming where to send three workers, and everyone's plans are revealed at once. Things are set up so that you generally want to draft something later than others. What you get (or can exchange for) varies based on the order that you ended up drafting it relative to the other players. Commonly if you show up later, you can do more of a thing, but have to pay more to do it. For room drafting, there are only two to draft, and the first player to show up will get nothing if two subsequent players take both rooms.

I feel that you do this drafting too few times, and it's too chaotic. It seems like you just know vaguely what you want to get more of, and hope that you can get it. For my money this programmed system should be scrapped and replaced with something more traditional, that makes it an advantage to be the start player and draft what you want as soon as you can. I don't like this dynamic where you hold back from doing what you need because you hope someone will set you up for something better.

Then, the adventurers attacking your dungeon is less interesting than the training scenarios. I think they (the actually occurring scenarios) are generally [i]easier[/i], maybe as compensation for the designer knowing the preceding drafting phases are too chaotic. Not sure, but it seems extremely hit-or-miss whether you're going to face any interesting decisions or feel tension.

I can't help but like the deterministic combat rules, though. Fighters move to the front. Thieves reduce trap damage. Priests heal after a combat, and Wizards cast a spell that is specified by a card draw.

...Tried replacing the drafting rule, so that you place workers in turn, and can place under any open spot under an action (except for the monster/room spots which must be filled from the bottom). This reduces the chaos and I like it quite a bit better; the game is at least a 7 this way.

Vlaada does like his complex rules but at least the instruction manual injects some amount of humour into the read.

Best played with four players as 2-player (and 3-player to a lesser degree) is a bit of a ballache to play due to the amount of time needed to play the bots.

One of the best rulebooks ever. Very easy to read and understand. Fun and thought prevoking.  Has the aggony of agricola but in a good way.  Even the 2 player game works nicely.  I hope the expansion makes it even better.  I like the way the boards are all used.  Artwork is nice. Good game.  The theme may be a turn off for some. Each time I play it I discovry some new way of playing.  Great game.

While interaction is indirect and weak, fun and strategy are high. Plenty of interesting tradeoffs and great theme integration make this fun. The plays don't seem terribly distinct from each other, though, and it's one game I hate to teach because there are almost excessively too many little rules. I've gone a while now without touching it, and I haven't cried over it.

RATING: 6
I think that the biggest flaw with this game, is that its way too complex for its theme and most casual gaming groups. The game also makes use of dummy players for 2 and 3 player games, something that I dislike very much. It's probably not be that big of a deal drawing 3 cards and blocking 3 worker placement spaces in a 3 player game. But in a 2 player game, the dummy mechanics really slow the game down and makes it way too AP prone. 
In fact I would not recommend this game with 2 player at all.

Also if you think your going to be building up an epic dungeon, your going to be very disappointed. Dungeon Lords, like Kingsburg, is all about building up and trying to survive the end of the year, when the game attacks you. So when the game is over you will be sitting there with half a ruin of a half finished looking dungeon, hoping the other players did worse than you.

Finally must say that I find the rule book a mess.

There seems like so much potential for more, but right now I haven't seen any other strategy but the super-paranoid defensive strategy work-- it feels that you should be rewarded more for going higher economy (more imps/tunnels) rather than just more evil.

needs exactly 4 players, otherwise someone's playing the extra boards.  very good theme integration and components, decisions FEEL interesting but it's hard to really mess up- thus scores just kind of push to a similar range... the learning curve to roughly optimal play is very small, making it good for 1 or 2 plays only. the differences between good players will generally come down to guessing wrong during the blind action selection-  which is the primary interaction, and is very small due to the guesswork involved.  

I've literally watched a game played where 2 of the players selected their actions (about 10 seconds), and then either had to get up to help customers or had to have the other players resolve the actions because they didn't really know what was going on.  This to me was the epitome of the problem- there's about 10 seconds of decision making, then several minutes of almost absolute automation during resolution.  I'm ok with some downtime,  but not 2000%+ downtime compared to the interesting decision time.

summary:
superb thematic integration, low meaningful interaction, only 4 players, and your decisions will probably all come out in the wash.

I liked it enough, has quite a few interesting things to make it more fun than your usual worker placement games.  The things that keep it from being great for me are that its just a bit too much.  Kind of fiddly, lot of rules to remember, bit too long, hero raiding feels a bit clumsy.

There's a ton of rules, and it's a bit clunky to explain since essentially combat and building are their own games with separate systems. Still, it's a pretty fun game that is essentially just Sim-dungeon.

Dungeon Lords is an interesting game where you build a dungeon with traps, monsters, rooms and such to attract heroes into your dungeon with the hopes of killing them.

The game is a basic resource management game where you manage things like imps, gold, food to buy traps, rooms, monsters, feed ghoulies, etc.

I find the game sort of tedious.  I WANT to like it, it's a beautiful game, but it seems to drag on and the dungeon encounters where the heroes come to your lair don't really feel particularly epic.

Can't beat the theme of this one.  The components help as well, especially the monsters and the imps.  It's cool building a dungeon, and preparing yourself for the heroes to come by stocking up on traps and monsters.  The evil track, the two different currencies, and the spatial aspect of building the dungeon are also cool trappings.  The one area that I found the theme somewhat lacking is in the mechanics.  Another worker placement game?  And these are independent dungeons, right?  Why are the costs for some things inflated if you do it?  I guess if you really stretch it, I can see why it would be harder to hire monsters, but it's pretty difficult to justify that everybody can't widen their tunnel system at the same time using the same number of imps.  But, all-in-all, it's still worth playing.  Give it a whirl, you just might like it.

Probably my biggest bgg.con disappointment. DL was ok, but nothing really stood out. Sliding scale for same role choices seemed really random to me. The second person to choose a role gets a better or cheaper item than the first person to choose the role, etc. So you could look over at the other players and say "Ok, three of the four of us can go for monsters this turn", but whether you got the #1 spot or the #3 spot just seemed hit or miss. Maybe if you're Kreskin and can read minds.

A puzzle solving game?  Yes - how do you prevent losing rooms/tunnels during the exploration phase.  Acquire the necessary resources/monsters/traps to get 'er done.  I like the pick a spot 2nd, get it for less than the first guy and the 2 cards which you can not use in consecutive rounds.  Lots of replay value.

Dopo averci giocato con l'espansione il gioco diventa nuovo fresco originale, difficile rigiocarci senza espansione.


Vlaada Chvatil è uno dei miei autori preferiti per la sua capacità di essere originale e mescolare al contempo meccaniche complesse ad ambientazioni leggere e divertenti, con una fortissima aderenza tema/regole.

40 minuti per spiegare le regole la prima volta ma poi ogni partita fila liscia senza intoppi, ogni partita dura 2 ore di gioco.

Very good so far. Realised we've been playing a couple of rules incorrectly which made a significant difference.

Мне особенно понравилась механика баталий. На отлично. Сперва мы долго собираем армию и ловушки лавирую по злости, чтобы к тебе пришли правильные герои. А затем когда начинается бой, то можно голову сломать пытаясь понять: как тем что у тебя есть их завалить минимальными усилиями. Никаких кубиков нету - чистый расчет на основании способностей героев, ловушек и монстров (или привидений). Все монстры (и привидения) различаются далеко не просто силой, как и ловушки, не говоря про героев или заклинания. Например слизень может либо плюнуть слабо по всем, либо просто "наслизить" так, чтоб герои долго отмывались и потеряли время. Поэтому расчет боя интересный и нетривиальный. Процессу конечно мешают заклинания, которые колдуют волшебники. Если предварительно не побывать на уроках в магической академии, то могут ожидать сюрпризы.

Кстати - карты заклинаний единственная фишка, которая требует знания языка от игроков. Если они не могут прочитать на карте (ну или отличить/вспомнить) заклинание, то им бесполезно ходить в академию чтобы подсматривать эти карты. Впрочем это не критичный вопрос и их можно не подсматривать, просто они всегда будут с сюрпризом. :) А если страшно, то можно сделать ставку на скорейшую нейтрализации волшебников своими ловушками и монстрами (или привидениями). :)

Игра часто заставляет хохотать. Это и изначальный юмор из рулбука, и юморные заклинания вроде огненного шара (не буду спойлерить), и различные неудачи, которые в такой атмосфере переходят в шутки. Тема игры вообще очень сильная.

Классные подсказки по процессу хода. Передвигаем фишку фазы и делаем что на иконках нарисовано. Процесс вообще довольно быстрый, и фактически в игре две главные фазы: одновременная тайная раздача приказов во время строительства и одновременная раздача приказов во время битвы. Остальные действия по большей части выполняются автоматически. А всего за игру 4 фазы строительства в первый год игры, затем 4 фазы боя, и аналогично на второй год игры. Итого всего 8 ходов на развитие подземелья, а за ход дается 3 приказа (по типу как в Агриколе)

Агрикола однако играется намного проще (по крайней мере семейный вариант). Там ставишь рабочего и тут же получаешь что надо. Тут же надо сразу 3 приказа спланировать тайно. После чего приказы всех игроков вскрываются и результат может несколько отличаться от желаемого. Хуже того, надо не просто угадывать кто куда пойдет, но и кто каким придет по счету. Может быть важно придти именно вторым, а не третьим, первым или конечно четвертым. Мало того, два из трех приказов прошлого хода нельзя повторять в следующем. Ум за разум заходит легко и непринужденно. (Ну если конечно думать, что необязательно) :)

Игра идет на очки, но этого не замечаешь. Как и в Агриколе их дают почти за все, но тема настолько яркая, а баталии жесткие, что на очки можно и забить не жалея. Их можно даже и не считать, если играть типа как семейный вариант.

Great, hilarious game. Agonising fun when you mess up and fail to feed/pay your big badass monsters and they run off badmouthing you and attracting the meanest hero adventurers who come and kill your other monsters and smash up your dungeon. Seems very complicated at first with loads of rules, but everything fits together and flows smoothly, almost intuitively. Only negative is the long rules explanation to new players. - "RoboRally worker placement"

The action selection mechanism is unique and fun, but overall the game doesn't do it for me. There are a lot of different currencies, which must all be attended to in order to avoid negative points. As a result one ends up doing roughly the same thing every game, so the game ends up being more complex than deep and ultimately too long for what it is. An enjoyable play every once in a blue moon. UPDATE: I would always rather play Dungeon Petz, which has a similar dynamic and aesthetic but plays in a shorter time, has a more exciting worker placement mechanic and feels less rigid.

Vlaada has found a new way for players to manage a ridiculous amount of chaos in his new game, this time simplifying the process down to a worker placement/resource management type of game.  The game is very complicated, but easy to play; the rules fiddliness is what accounts for the inherent chaos.  The game should be played with 4 players only, though, since any players fewer than 4 are replaced by dummy players whose actions each round are randomly chosen and whose minions are placed on the level 2 action of whichever cards are chosen.  It works fairly well, without having to keep up with various actions for the dummy player, but its unpredictability and randomness can be a little frustrating.

In this game, you are the lord of a dungeon, trying to make your growing domain resistant to 'the good guys.' The thematic elements of this game are amazing and hilarious. You really feel like a harried manager in a factory full of goofy employees.

In Dungeon Lords, you are an evil dungeonlord who is trying to build the best dungeon out there. You hire monsters, build rooms, buy traps and the other usual stuff.

\13\\13\

Have you ever ventured with party of heroes to conquer dungeons, gain pride, experiences and of course rich treasure? And has it ever occurred to you how hard it actually is to build and manage such underground complex filled with corridors and creatures? No? Well now you can try. Put yourself in role of the master of underground, summon your servants, dig complex of tunnels and rooms, set traps, hire creatures and try to stop filthy heroes from conquering and plundering your precious creation. We can guarantee you will look on dark corners, lairs and their inhabitant from completely different perspective!

RATING: 7
Vlaada Chvátil works his magic on another classic PC series. While not quite as good as Through the Ages, this take on the cult classic Dungeon Keeper is still a very good game. This re-imagined version is basically a worker placement game. The workers are of course imps...and adorable imps, at that. Using these imps, players construct and populate a dungeon with monsters. The goal being to build the most evil lair in the land. Unlike other worker placement games however, this game fights back. At the end of the round, a party of adventurers invades each player's creation. This portion of the game is something that most people will either love or hate. The dungeon raid plays out like a puzzle, with each player trying to utilize his dungeon rooms, traps, and monsters to destroy the encroaching party. I personally enjoy this phase of the game, as it is usually quite the brain burner. Some people find the switch to solitaire mode a bit jarring, but my group  enjoys watching everyone's dungeons fail spectacularly...it's usually good for a lot of laughs.

Speaking of laughs, Dungeon Lords has one the most entertaining rulebooks I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It does a good job of not only teaching you the game in an enjoyable manner, but also in justifying why certain spaces have fluctuating rewards. In general, it's best to be the SECOND player to choose a given action. The rulebook explains why this is so, usually in comedic fashion. The overall effect is that it makes a lot of the game balance mechanisms feel a bit less artificial.

The main reason I don't rate this as highly as Through the Ages is that I don't believe it has as much replay value. You are playing against the game more than against the other players. After a few runs through the hero fights there aren't a whole lot of surprises left for you. There is actually some rudimentary control over which adventurer attacks which dungeon and you can create some interaction by manipulating this...but it requires so much analysis to pull off that it clashes with the fun theme the game works so hard to create. This brings up another issue as well. For a game with such a whimsical theme, it is incredibly difficult to teach. Learning how to fight the invading heroes takes a good 45 minutes, as players need to understand how each character fights and by extension, how to counter them. This isn't a big deal in a regular gaming group, but trust me, teaching this part of the game over and over gets incredibly tiresome.

I love Dungeon Lords, but it is seriously hard to get it to the table, because of the steep learning curve. Frankly, I've become to lazy to teach it anymore...It's too bad, because it really is a fun experience.

This is a very well-designed game, but it hits two of my biggest pet peeves in gaming. For one thing, depending on how things play out, the entire second year of combat could be utterly pointless, since one player may be enough in the lead that it doesn't matter - and, yet, combat can take a while with AP players (most of the people I play with, and I have a touch of it now and then). The second, more major one is that I hate being locked into decisions based on unknown information, like you are with your second and third order each turn. These make it not fun for me, but I can definitely understand why so many enjoy this.

The premise of the game is building a dungeon and populating it with monsters and traps, but the core mechanic is an unforgiving blind auction/action selection.

Imagine Agricola, but instead of selecting actions one at a time, everyone secretly selects in advance and ties are broken by rock-paper-scissors. Good luck trying to use a bread-baking strategy.

That's what Dungeon Lords is: Pure chaos. Players expecting to find a game about building the best dungeon are going to be disappointed.

A unique game of action selection, where each player is a dungeon master and pesky heroes come into the dungeon and try to take it over. The idea is pretty cool and the game is beautiful.

Fun on a bun!

Based on early reviews I had written this one off for my game group as too complex.  I like complex games just fine, but usually can't get them to the table if they're for more than two players (and even then it's tough).  Finally got to play Heidi and Jason's copy and it's straight back to the wish list!  This game is not nearly as complex as it has been made out to be.  If you can play Galaxy Trucker, you can play this.  If you can play Agricola, you're way ahead of the game.

There are two main phases to the game: building and populating your dungeon, and fighting off the adventurers.  The first phase is heavily reliant on simultaneous action selection.  I love this mechanic, but there are a lot that hate it, so if that's you know that this is probably half the game.

If you've played Galaxy Trucker, fighting off the adventurers feels similar to the surviving-the-flight phase of that game, but with a lot more strategy.  The decisions in the survival phase of Galaxy Trucker are mostly trivial, but in Dungeon Lords it can be surprisingly deep and analytical.  The introductory puzzles show this off beautifully.  If you're worried about AP, it can certainly strike here.  I was very pleasantly surprised by this aspect of the game.

Anyway, I'm excited about Dungeon Lords.  If I had disposable income and closet space at the moment, I would have already placed my order.  Unfortunately I'll have to wait until the next gift-giving holiday for an excuse.

Take an incredibly tight game, add programming on top so you can screw it up even more, and the game takes even longer? No thanks.

I hate that you can get so many negative points. I was told if my score is positive it's great, and the scoring board goes to -15. I ended up with +14, but come on, I want to play, not work.

The titles at the end feel so arbitrary, the are pretty much irrelevant to gameplay, but give a lot of points.

I liked the battle, but there's only 2 of that, and it doesn't really encourage combos, because normall you only have 1 trap and 1 monster. At the end I got a room that allowed for two traps and it was a lot of fun to combo them, but you can almost never do something like that.

Warning, this is not a gateway Euro to start out new gamers on.  This is a game reminiscent of the computer game Dungeon Keeper where you get to try out your ability to manage a dungeon and fight off the annoying adventurers who keep coming in and messing up you crib.  There's really a good planning element to the game in deciding what order to play traps and monsters (or ghosts) to whomp on the intruders and keep from losing dungeon tiles to them.  All the while you need to manage your food and gold resources to keep up with taxes to the Ministry of Dungeons.  There's enough randomness to keep it from being a gamer's game but it certainly has a lot going on to keep you thinking about what you want to acquire and how to manage what you have.

Достаточно гиковый миплплейсер, совмещенный с решением головоломки "Отбейся от 3-4 героев ограниченными силами за отведенное количество ходов с минимальными потерями". Достаточно брутальна. Почти не прощает ошибок и просчетов. При этом тема раскрыта на отлично. Игра очень хорошо оформлена, с художественной точки зрения. Но, с точки зрения дизайна, общее поле получилось перегруженным и очень пестрым. Любителям активного взаимодействия между игроками не советую, его тут практически нет. Также, решающее влияние исхода боевок (два раза за игру) на результаты партии может не прийтись по вкусу любителям классических евроигр и миплплейсеров. В общем, отличная игра, но не "без недостатков" и на любителя.

This is so much fun. It takes the simultaneous action selection that I love from Key Largo and mixes it with the torturous resource and action allocation of Agricola.

Fantastic euro-style game, done in true Vlaada-style: build something up, and then watch it get trashed.  The balance between worker-placement building of the dungeon, and the puzzle of fighting off adventurers, could prove jarring to some; I love it.  It's a surprisingly brutal game, though, that punishes mistakes, and its easy to finish with a negative score your first game or two.

What's good: some interesting good mechanics. the theme is very nice and well developed.

What's annoying: it's too long, too many things to get into account, too chaotic. Some magic cards really can upset all your strategy when facing the heroes. Sure you have some way to foresee what the other could do, but getting in the corerct position in the action table is too much a matter of luck sometimes. 
The battle against heroes is too involuted and long.

The best thing about this game is the humor in the rulebook--which is a good thing, because learning the rules takes a lot of effort, so someone will be spending serious quality time with that rulebook.

I'm a big Chvatil fan and we are age old RPG'ers. Super great game, unfortunately it is too much of a grind and play just gets bogged down for us.  The playful box and game art are so deceiving. Everyone thinks we are about to embark on a beer & pretzel dungeon romp and then I get into explaining the rules and I can see their enthusiasm wane, eyes glaze over.

Too much randomness for the duration of the game. If you dont get the good monsters to fight the heroes, you are screwed and from there it come down to "limit the damage". Not enought fun coming from this game for the duration of the play.

Dungeon Keeper - The Boardgame. Spel kent twee gezichten, namelijk de bouwfase en de overleeffase.

De bouwfase is het daadwerkelijke spel, waarin de spelers strijden om monsters, kamers en goede reputatie. De overleeffase is een simulatie om te zien hoe goed iedereen zijn/haar kerker heeft gemaakt.

This and Dungeon Petz. Applies to both. They're both beautifully produced games. They play well, but...
They're not immediately simple or elegant to play. The game also gives me an angst that I used to get with Age of Steam. It's hard to explain except that often I'm not sure I really want to put the amount of energy required to a. reread the rules again to teach the game and b. to play the game well. I love vlaada chvatil games, but I think this is why makes many of his games don't make it to the table often.

With the exception of Age of Empires III (which has its own issues), my track record shows that I'm not a big fan of worker placement games.

So. Why own Dungeon Lords?  It happens to be unusual, themey, and also "fun enough."

Dungeon Lords fills a niche in my collection, in that it happens to satisfy both Eurogamers and dungeon-lovers.  This means I can now pull out a game that Agricolites and Le Havrians actually enjoy.

As far as my own gaming satisfaction goes, I suspect that Dungeon Lord's silly mass-destructive charm will grow on me over time.

Oh, nevermind. Haven't played this in 5 years and don't want to.  Adios!

You are designing a dungeon as your home to be able to fight off the invading knights and priests and such. Very clever reversal of theme. It takes a while to learn the system and then at least a game to see how everything will come together. It is also long.

Vlaada continues to allow the themes he's working with directly affect his game designs, something I always appreciate.  Original learning curve is steep for a Euro, but hums along well enough once a few turns have passed.  Exceedingly procedural, and more time is spent doing sums and small logic problems that actually designing a dungeon, which was a bit disappointing.

[b]Pillars of the Earth[/b]: Don't place workers in sequence, pull them from a bag instead.
[b]Stone Age[/b]: Don't collect specific benefits, to determine the amount roll dice instead.
[b]Vasco de Gama[/b]: Don't pay an action cost, randomly pay that amount [+3,-3] instead.
[b]Carson City[/b]: Don't expect a selected action, duel Games of Thrones style for it instead.
[b]Dungeon Lords[/b]: Don't anticipate some payout from a square, randomly join a queue determined by how many people selected the action and in what order instead.

Remember Set? The game of similarity recognition slash verification of your dog's epilepsy? (Or lack thereof.) Well, I see a set. I don't know why this set's shared characteristic is desirable, but I see the set. In all of these post-Caylus worker placement games, this action you think you're getting... you're not actually getting it.

What's funny about Dungeon Lords is that the gimmicky Robo Rally-esque blind action programming only impedes the flavorful, reasonably thought-provoking worker placement system. It's complex enough to create and defend your own dungeon; traditional worker placement would suffice. Normally it's simplistic games that need this kind of indirect, lottery-style "system" - think Trajan, where acquiring VP's is very straightforward and obvious, hence the system of trays to brute force inefficiency into the process.

Nevertheless Dungeon Lords is pretty enjoyable. Traps v. Monsters is an interesting dilemma, as Monsters stick around for both fights and score end-game points, but have upkeep costs and limit one per tunnel, while Traps are one-time use and wonderful for tunnels, if not rooms. The Evilometer is a great touch, but the annuity benefits from allocating imps to rooms is vital, yet the process for acquiring these rooms is hopelessly chaotic. With "locked" actions, it's unlikely an area will exceed its capacity of three (i.e. all players choose it), but the most important part of the game only has a capacity of two. Moreover, the first guy present gets ousted by the next two players, and the fourth guy gets shafted because of filled capacity, meaning everyone walks the same tightrope of too-early, too-late musical chairs. It's a bluff-double-bluff gamble because waiting until next turn might also fail if players put room in their first slot to avoid locking it.

The dilemma of Age of Empires III and Caylus: "If only I could get what I want, when I want it." (Turns are fragmented into worker placements, actions must be selected carefully to preserve long-term strategy with regard to the best quality actions present and leaving those to an opponent.)

The dilemma of Dungeon Lords et al: "If only I could get what I want, after I'm already entitled to it."

I love this Ameritrash game. LOVE IT. You build a dungeon to imprison the pesky heroes that will try and bring you down. My only gripe is that it is only playable with 4, if you have less, you must use an automated A.I board and it does work, but its annoying. That aside, I love the theme (you are an evil lord raising monsters and building traps in your dungeon. However, you catch the attention of local heroes and they will come to your dungeon to conquer you. You must capture them and score the most points over two rather lengthy rounds each divided into four parts. Some day I'll get that expansion...

as fun and confusing as i thought it would be.  evokes dungeon keeper, while being also it's own game.  also evokes several other modern euros... Agricola, i'm looking at you.  has a high difficulty curve, due to the interaction between resource gathering and the battles.  great graphics and tone, and bits.  The most fun and challenging bit is the action selection mechanism.  It is wonderful and complex, and thought-provoking.  This is where the true miracle of the game happens.  If you just plop down your three actions without deep thought about how you want them to play out, and how they will interact with the other player's choices, you will lose.

RATING: N/A
8 after 1 play.

Bidding system is refreshing and encourages player interaction. Preparation for the incoming invasion is interesting and the better half of the game. The fighting part feels like multiplayer solo and is the weak link in the game. It is also unfortunate that this game does not play too well with 2 or 3 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
On first impression this doesn't seem like my kind of game. It felt like another efficiency drive type of exercise with limited player interaction. "I do my thing over here, you do your thing over there." Push cubes around the track. We only played a single year as a demonstration just to get a feel for how it goes so I don't have a full experience of it yet. I'd be prepared to give it another chance but I'm not excited by the prospect.

RATING: 3
I might have to call this a "blind worker placement game", sure you can sort of figure out what your opponents are up to, and block or avoid those actions, but sadly in gameplay this is so sloooow... There's the waiting for everyone to be happy with their 3 cards, displaying them 1 at a darn time and placing our Minions on the actions, then resolving them 1 at a time in the same order each time. All that and no direct interaction at all, unless you play with the Magic Items - sigh!

For me it's too slow, with not enought direct confrontation or enough interaction. If someone plays poorly and lags behind, there's nothing they can do, but hope that the person in the lead screws up as well.

The game has a fun and funny theme, and breakinig up the gameplay with puzzle-solving seems cool, but again just leads to lots of waiting on everyone to complete their puzzles.

It is also a hog to teach someone, with lots of rules (even if they are well written and funny) and unless you play with players of near equal skill, it becomes highly chaotic, just like with blind bidding games.

I like this less with each play.

A game that did not lived up to it's expectations. For me it's a game that didn't know what it want to look like: pure fun like Galaxy Trucker or brainburner with lots of decisions like Through the Ages.

On one hand: there is action selection and planning
On the other: there is a lot of randomness with traps cards and magic (and action selected by other players).

I hoped that fighting would be more fun but it was mhmm easy and obvious. Have to try it at least once more but than again - I don't feel like I want to play it again in near future.

[b]The Treasure Chest full of platinum coins and diamond swans:[/b]

1. Beautifully manufactured game.
2. A ton of components.
3. Consistent art.
4. Great theme.

[b]The festering pool of bulbous-eyed slime:[/b]

1. Too fiddly for 2 players.
2. A massive theme misfire, a WASTE of theme.
3. You build the smallest dungeon known to man or troll.
4. Overwrought rules.
5. Tough punishments for small mistakes.
6. Steep learning curve - you need to play a training level first!
7. Boring puzzle-solving combat.
8. Not enough hack and slash.
9. Feels like a third of a brilliant game, with two thirds of a cabbage farming game bolted on.
10. Way too long to play for the pay-off.
11. You seem to be managing decline, rather than assembling a Dungeon of the Bear or Uncle Ugly's Underground type of super-dungeon.
12. I'm programmed to love games like this, so it hurts doubly when it's as flat as this baby.
13. I found the game frustrating on many, many levels, continually wishing I was playing another game. Another game exactly like this one, but with "fun" added, and a good half of the fat butchered away.
14. Cutesy-poo art. Extremely well done cutesy-poo, but too whimsical and cute for this old, Tunnels and Trolls DM.

Great game ! CGE= heavy rules,
I would classify that game as a complexe game. Preparation, anticipation, management... You rule your own dungeon. Sharing the spaces of the central board. But some spaces are better than others. And the way to acces to them is clever. You might wait one turn to try to get the perfect spot.

Somehow despite the ease of play I'm always worn out at the end of a DL game.  I think I get just a bit too excited :D

Note: Had the opportunity to teach the game to and 11 year old.  He did remarkably well with little coaching except during the combat puzzles.  None of the steps of play are particularly hard... there are just a lot of them!

Great game. Despite the steep learning curve a start, the game concept is fairly simple, yet still offers a lot of depth and strategy.

RATING: 6
Vlaada Chvátil is truly a talented man.  The way he is able to inject unique concepts into different genre of games is really a sight to behold, and I do appreciate his take on them.  However, other than Through the Ages, everything else since then just have not hit the right chord and thus felt flat to me.

In his latest design, Dungeon Lords pit the players against generic heroes, which I suppose is serviceable but ultimately boring (and static, making replayability a problem), once you figure out the correct way of dealing with each class.  The simultaneous action selection is only interesting because two of your choices become unavailable every other round which serve as limited open information to everyone else.  There is a bit of strategy involved in guessing what actions other people will select and in what order, but there is still a big dose of randomness to it.

The building of the dungeon itself is disappointing.  There is a lack of variety in room tiles that will actually help in the defense of your lair; the questionable usefulness of trap cards; and the inability to make legal loops or place rooms next to each other make no sense to me.

In the end, you may even consider Dungeon Lords a kind of a rip off of Kingsburg.  You go through the same exact four seasons in preparation for an impending disaster (a party of adventurers rather than barbarian hordes).  Instead of dice rolling to gather resources you flip cards, both has a worker placement style with one offering a more interesting mechanic than the other.  You know, now that I think about it, the structure is awfully similar.  I guess it's no wonder I didn't care for it, since I didn't really like Kingsburg either.

This game is all about theme. When I introduce this title to new players they got their heads exploded. It's so much rules to talk about, that you turn off your listening mode and just shutdown yourself. But when you play DL you see that it's not so hard at all. You start to enjoy it a lot. I play DL with my friends because of its theme. It doesn't much matter who wins, as long as we have fun crushing heroes.

Competition over opportunities make up the bulk of player interaction, interspersed with puzzle-like combat sessions against parties of random adventurers following a few simple rules of conduct (fighters always go to the front of the party, etc.).

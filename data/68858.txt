Chambering maids and choosing the buildings is fun.

Works very well as a stand-alone game.  More strategy needed than Dominion, although fewer action cards so it gets old quicker.

The Gardens mechanic, like Chambermaiding in the base game,  further differentiate this from other deckbuilders.

RATING: 8
The first expansion to [i][thing=65282]Tanto Cuore[/thing][/i] which adds more maids to the mix as well as buildings to add to the estate. It can be played as a stand-alone set and does not come with the Bad Habit cards from the first set because these were replaced by the Buildings.

RATING: 6.5
An okay deckbuilding game with a bit of a tacky theme. Fun in a group willing to take it as something ridiculous, uncomfortable in a group that likes to leer.

A good successor to The first game. Buildings add a new twist to an alredy excellent game.

Art is on level of the first game

Likes: A standalone expansion. This adds buildings to the base game, which offer players further options and strategies to score points.

Dislikes: It doesn't do too much in terms of innovation for deck-building games. It's pretty much Dominion with a few changes and lots of flavor/theme. The art doesn't always mesh well with everyone.

RATING: 7
What I liked:
* Similar core mechanic to Dominion however a number of cards play very differently so you can't treat it like Dominion.
* Stand alone game that also plays slightly different to the base game.

What I didn't like:
* Poor manual, scoring is confusing for some cards
* Theme not exactly family friendly

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Just as fun as Dominion (I hope they're getting royalties from this), and the creepy theme drops away after half a play, thankfully.  Sadly, this version also has the direct player attacking, even though I thought it didn't when I bought it (which is why I bought this and not the first one).  Get rid of that, and this would be an 8 - one less than Dominion (it loses a point for a complete lack of originality).

Sleeved in KMC Hyper Matte. Better as an expansion than standalone - the building mechanic is not as fun/interesting as the illness/bad habits of TC1 or the reminiscences of TC3 (perhaps because it's less "attacking"). I'm fine combining this with other TCs but prefer not to play it on its own. The drawback to this is that Ririko is then essentially required, reducing the number of randomised maids.

RATING: 6
A deckbuilding game with a lot of front-loaded decisions. I liked this better than Dominion, but I no longer like playing non-digital versions of deckbuilding games. In terms of digital deckbuilding games, I'd rather play ascension, or if in the mood for a front-loaded decision-making deckbuilding game: Penny Arcade was the most appealing to me.

In terms of the three, I would rank them as follows:

Romantic Vacation > Expanding the House > Base Game

Puts the "dom" in [gameid=36218].

As it's all innuendo, players are either octogenarian scions of industrialist dynasties who run around their estates (sans pants) "Benny-Hilling" a bevy of concupiscent maids—livin' [i]la vida[/i] Pleistocene—or they are serial killers.  All the nudging and winking could topple the thematic balance either way.

If you draw a straight line 25,000-years-long between the two data points of the Venus of Willendorf and this game you end up underscoring the fact that men are filthy pigs who, for reasons known only to Nature, can become violently erect at the sight of a boob-shaped cloud.  [i]Damn you, super-sexy sky![/i]

My friends are hideous, and so I had tears in my eyes playing this.  Ah, well.  My love pillow would understand.

This one gets an 8 bc the expansion is a bit clashy with the original cards, more than the original cards w/ themselves.

The buildings really add a fun new element to the game. It creates a lot of new possibilities, and that maids in the expansion really take advantage of the possibilities there. Of the handful of games I've played of Tanto Cuore, I think I've enjoyed the ones with buildings the most.

RATING: 6.5
First expansion to the Dominion-style deck builder with an anime French maids theme (if you don't mind poses with low modesty, don't play this game!). The difference between this set and the base set is that this set replaces the negative cards with buildings that give bonuses -- though you can play this mixed with the other as well as stand alone.

BIG PLUS: more enjoyable than Dominion, stand alone as well as mixable
BIG MINUS: young girls in poses that will turn off others

Initial impression of this game is very good.  There are some very strategic decisions in this game and a lot of different routes to gaining victory point which I really like.  I have held off on buying Dominion but have played it and feel like this game has more options with less clunkiness.  Your deck stays pretty slim the entire game and never gets gunked up with VP cards or curses.
  The card art is really beautiful even if there are some provocative shots, which doesn't bother me personally as a female gamer.  I really don't see the difference between this card art and some of the female characters in a game like Rune Bound or Talisman...it's just that they are anime maids.  Main reason for this purchase was due to my husband liking the art and I will buy just about any game he is actually interested in playing!  He has requested to play again so this is definately a winner.

[I always add it to the basic game]

More maids to finally have enough variety are great (even if overall they are slightly less interesting that those in the original game).
The "buildings" add mostly only length to the game and so we often play without them.

Great deckbuilding game with a GORGEOUS art. I have a lot of fun when playing this baby and will always want to play. It has some very nice mechanisms which differ it from Dominion.

I have integrated all the 4 boxes (base game, Expanding the House, Romantic Vacation and Oktoberfest) together and I use a randomizer which can be found on nekomusume.net. I can't recommend both the game and the randomizer enough!

I Love this game!  The art is cute, the combos are pretty sweet, there a decent amount of replayability through randomly selecting the maids for the game.  And there are puns and innuendos galore so we have a fun, silly time with it.  We even play classical music while we play to fit the theme :-P

A difference compared to the base game is that the maids are much more challenging to combo off of each other in this set.

This makes the game much better but I heard the other expansions are not nearly as good so I am going to stop here.

Expanding the House wprowadza dodatkowe budynki, które dają nowe możliwości punktowania, pozwalają na większą kontrolę nad zawartością talii, czy chronią nas przed niekorzystnymi wydarzeniami. Rozgrywka się zbyt mocno nie zmienia, ale jest odpowiednio uatrakcyjniona.

RATING: 7
This was my entry point to the Tanto Cuore series, and a game that my group played to death as a standalone title before we got the other sets. In hindsight, this was a good introductory title because it's a lot less confrontational than the base game and a better fit for my group's playstyle. (That said however, the Private Maid Mika is a death kiss upon any player who receives her in the early game.)

Buildings – the set's signature mechanism – are very straightforward to use but offer good utility. In fact, they are representative of a set which makes fairly safe and vanilla design choices, yet is able to weave smoothly into the larger game.

RATING: 8
Expansions are good for Tanto Cuore. The base set has too many cards that allow you to draw more cards on top of giving you extra actions, making it impossible to avoid having mid/late-games where players take forever with their turns because they're using all their draw cards and plus action effects to draw out their entire decks. Expansions add more cards that force players into awkward mid/late-game situations that don't allow them to draw a million cards and take like an hour to finish their turns.

RATING: 9
Excellent expansion. Some character cards are a bit boring in regards of both art and abilities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent expansion that adds buildings to the mix. The maids in this set are more complex than those found in the base set, which leads to more advanced strategies and many different paths to victory. I still find new uses for cards and different deck builds each time I play. 

Swallow your pride guys and look past the quirky artwork, Tanto is the best deckbuilder on the market.

The general maids in this set are a bit more interesting.  
The building cards are good for players that are being spammed with event cards from the base set.  
Adds more private maids.

Gives a better overall experience when expanding the base set.

It's a weird rating, because seriously, it fully relies on the Dominion mechanism. That doesn't prevent the game from being fun, though, and I guess the Dominion mechanism can't be credited to Dominion only forever. I haven't played the Dominion expansions, and perhaps they turn out to be as mad as this expansion to Tanto Cuore, but… that's not the point. This works well as a stand-alone, too. It's less aggressive than the base set, and, just like it, it's about loading your deck with cards, and gradually phase them out of your deck, and time it so that you've basically emptied your deck just as the game ends. Interesting card combos allows for a different type of play. The maids are a tad more naughtily dressed in this game though, might turn some off and some on.

Something for you if you already own Dominion and all its expansions? Only if you're into the anime maid art, I think.

Really wanted to like this one as the game sounds neat. Unfortunately the game just feels a little too luck dependent. The professor moves randomly and can really screw things up. The variable player powers are nice but it's irritating drawing 2 random ones each turn and having your power change on you each time; they seem to come up at the wrong time - it would be far more interesting if they were more reliable.

PEatCoT is a cooperative game where players try to rescue historical items from the hideout of the eponymous professor.

It offers a puzzling gameplay, with players infiltrating the citadel and trying to recover 4 of the precious items before the professor can do the same. The players have different characters with various abilities (and six action cards) and must coordinate well to succeed.

The game is quite prone to the usual (for coops) alpha player syndrome, and sometimes it feels a bit subject to randomness (te movement of the professor is dice based, with no actual ways to predict it).

The production value is quite high (I particularly like the box), but I must also point out that the design of the board seem a bit overdone (it is quite difficult to find stuff on it).

To round up this mini-review: it falls in the same category of Pandemic or Fire Rescue, but feels less elegant and with a less attractive theme...

I played the prototype and I now played the game with few friends. The game is as gorgeous as fun. We played twice and we win one time against the professor. Very easy to get in the game and very tough sometimes. Real full coop design with all players having specific powers and clever rules for the movement of the Professor. We enjoyed a lot

RATING: 3
An abstract optimization engine with a lukewarm theme pasted-on, Professor Evil and the Citadel of Time is a bad, uninspired cooperative that turns enthusiasm off as soon as you realize how puzzly it is, which happens in the very first round already: it’s the alpha player’s wet dream, as everything in this game screams optimization and leaves nothing to theme or improvisation.

If you’re looking for a dry, soulless puzzle, go no further: this is the game you have dreamt of so far. But if you like your theme and a little more drama or unpredictability in your games, then move along: nothing to see here for you.

Cooperative games just aren't my thing. Especially ones with full information for all players. Just a puzzle with some luck elements thrown in. It feels pointless to have more than one person playing this game.

Playes it once and probably never again.

I did not like the art and style.  This game has very random feel, it seems not well balanced and it has a confusing crowded board which comes in a ugly steril vector art.
Not my choice.

Very difficult to win if the dice work against you.  It was fun but the balance feels off.  We did get one rule wrong so maybe the rating will rise. Co-ops are not my a favorite genre of mine though.

My personal impression was that it was messy. Hard to actually grasp the different parts of the board. It felt very random with the professor jumping around both in space and time. Very hard to actually make any plans. Especially first play is hard when you need to re-read the cards all the time.

RATING: 3
Well we are "experienced" coop gamers and we got crushed... and not in a good way like ghost stories or Robinson Crusoe . We were very disappointed in this game. The art is great, the theme is cool, the title is funny and most of the mechanics are good. For us there was too much randomness between the player cards (ok non that I can use this turn) and the movement of the professor. We came in wanting to like it and all 5 of us left with no inclination to play again. Now maybe the rules were not final, maybe we played badly but we just felt frustrated.So the difficulty of the game for us has no meaning as it seems too chaotic.

Solid coop design that likely will offer the exact same level of tension every time you play. It will always be a tight competition between professor and the players since the game clock has been implemented very well. Will probably lack long term replayability due to not being able to offer variety. Do yourself a favor and keep Destiny in the box. She's a garbage character.

On your turn you get 3 moves.  You can move, turn off a trap, or claim a treasure.  The object is to get four treasures before the professor gets 4.  You play cards that give you some assistance as well.  At the end of your turn the professor moves, closing doors and turn on traps and if he enters your room, kicks you out.  You also get a special ability for one of your players.  

Nice looking game with a good art.  In general, this game is incredibly hard.  You must have the character that allows you to enter the professors room, and turn off a trap and claim a treasure.  Without him, you need to get lucky to win and there is little you can do otherwise.  I would not say the game is broken as I don't know all the characters, but randomly selected ones almost certainly cannot win.

Good looking game and components, but this is a mediocre coop game. Player card powers seem so random, activate other players and such, it just felt like a weird balancing mechanic that didn't fit with the rest of the game.

Super simple to pick up and learn and start playing, but still a lot of decisions to make the game very interesting. The art and production quality are gorgeous. Only played twice, but keep getting our asses handed to us hardcore. I have no idea how to win this game. Like, beginning to think it might be slightly impossible to win? Not sure what strategies we're missing. Also we've randomly gotten the blonde chick character both times, and she seems like the worst character in the game. Like, all of her cards have just somehow made things worse for us every time. *Update* We won our first game! I think having 4 players to be able to spread out a bit more helped a little bit, but I'm now convinced it is possible at all player counts. Also not having that blonde chick for once helped. We were still very close to losing though. Looking forward to playing this more.

Wow, this is a TOUGH co-op! At least, it seemed pretty damn difficult with just the two of us! Mechanically this is pretty simple: move your guys around, use your actions to disarm traps, open doors, grab treasure. This is driven by a nice hand management system: you choose cards to play, each of which gives you a different number of points to spend and/or some power. Of course, the Professor then moves around undoing much of what you just did! All of this is under time pressure: you only have a certain number of turns to do things, and you can lose time due to randomly poor dice rolls.

We had a good time, but I'm not sure I see a lot of reason to recommend this over any other co-op games. Even if I were a fan of co-ops, this one has the unfortunate problem of having an overly cluttered board where it's a bit difficult finding all the stuff (e.g. all the saw traps) scattered in random locations on the board ... too much work!

Professor Evil (I bet they spent hours coming up with that name) has created a time machine and is stealing valuable artifacts. The game is a cooperative race to rescue them from his mansion before they are lost forever. The artwork and components are really well done, and the game does a good job of putting the pressure on you to use your abilities and actions wisely.

Beautifull artwork and production and a cool theme. One  of my friends called it 'modern Cluedo' because of the rooms and the overall feel. I do not agree on that one. The game looks great but underneath lies a mechanic which is fulled based on three dice (read 80% (bad)luck). You have some influence with the actions of your hero but that is nothing compared to the dice rolling. Each character has its own abilities which is nice, but I one game you might just see all abilities twice. I feel like they could have easily added double amount of abilities to give the game more replayability.

Just not an enjoyable coop. Much better entries (Gloomhaven, Pandemic Legacy, Hanabi) in the coop space. It was described as a mix between an escape room and Time Stories. I didn’t feel that was accurate - this was a run-of-the-mill coop game. I don’t plan to revisit it.

GAME: Dust Tactics: Revised Core Set
RANK: 2140
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Miniature game, but played within a grid layout...
No need to paint or glue miniatures...

-1 Because you will have to spend a lot of $$$ if you want a decent, varied army, like most miniature games... Miniatures in the basic game is the bare minimum...
-1 Disappointing paper-thin grid to play on... Also comes with too few dices... Buying more dices is almost necessary (unless you can live with ordinary dices with 5-6 (or 1-2) meaning a hit)...
-1 Playing on a grid layout make the game speedier and somewhat easier, but it's also it's downfall. Promote a tendency for 'gamey' or 'chess' moves over more natural moves of a classic open terrain miniature...

Initial Impression: The miniatures for this game are excellent. The attention to detail is nice and some units even have moveable/poseable parts. The gameplay is a simple combination of move/fire. The alternate WWII history mixed with steampunk makes for an interesting setting to host the battles. There seems to be alot of game in  the base set. For now, our plan is to enjoy all that the base set has to offer before deciding whether to expand the game or eventually trade it away.

This is a quick, bloody war game that uses a grid to make it easy to determine line of sight.  It is great for players who want a fast, simple tactics game not bogged down with a lot of rules.  However, some players may find the game too be too simple and lacking options.

Wargames are not my thing but my son seems to love them.  Since he plays Euros with me, I reciprocate and play some of his wargames with him.  Dust Tactics is enjoyable enough -- the games don't drag along and there's not too much downtime.  The units are well done.  All in all, a pretty good game, just not in my wheelhouse.  This would probably rate a 9 or so for my son, though.

Though it's still the same brilliant mix of boardgame and tabletop game, the revised core set of Dust Tactics has less value.

If you don't have the original core set, or you want to complement the original set with light mechs, then it's worth getting.

But if you can choose, and get the original box, you should.

Only disadvantage of the core set that I see, is fantastic poster that is the board. Absolutely dissapointing. Expansion of the hard tiles is a must. Apart from that - game is very good. Obviously you need more units than the ones that are given in the base set. Also - there should be additional dice set. I like to have mine and only mine :) Together with the expansions you get more and more terrain (buildings, tank traps ect) - that's very good. Also new map tiles - which is even better. Figures are fantastic quality, just require paining.

In the spectrum between a tabletop miniatures game and a hex-and-counter wargame, this one is in a blurry grey area that is awful close to a tabletop minis.

The dice conventions are dumb and the abstractions do not go nearly far enough. Way too much crap is in this game instead of on the editing room floor. Great minis though, and some of the ideas could be hopefully used in future boardagmes.

A great expansion for those who own Dust Tactics, and a good way to get into the game if you plan on mainly playing Dust Warfare.

With lower quality paper maps, I can't quite rate this a 10 along with the other Dust Tactics products though.

Still, highly recommended.  If you're looking at getting into this game though, get the original core set instead while it's still available.  It's a much better value, with more components and the much-higher quality cardboard tiles.

RATING: 5.5
I expected to love this game. I read a bunch of reviews and it didn't bother me at all that the game was thought by some to be pretty simple. I love Heroscape and despite the fact it's a simple game I find it to be full of interesting tactical and strategic choices. Well, I still found Dust Tactics lacking. I think the main problem of this game is that the battlefiled should be much larger for this set of rules (one reviewer called it a problem of resolution of the battlefield)and this is taking into consideration that the game posters provided in the core set are HUGE. All in all I was pretty disappointed after the first game and decided to stick to Heroscape for this type of gaming entertainment.

I felt like I had an incomplete game, wich happens with some "collecting" type of games. In this case, though, it was way too expensive for what it brings to the table. I would recommend you to try it before buying it and, if you like it, consider investing a lot of money to see its full potential.

I want to love this game, but it seems to be missing that special something. Where are the tactics? It seems armies march towards each other, and fighting is very bloody. Infantry wind up obliterating the tanks. Also, how stupid stupid looking that walker tank, named "Hot Dog" was finally killed the game for me.

RATING: 4
Super detailed and beautiful miniatures but the few people I got to try this one were all left saying "That's It?".  For a game with such detailed miniatures it was too light.  It did mostly have that feeling of just marching everything at the other side and seeing what happens.  As someone who has played many a wargame both light and very heavy it just lacked that one special thing that would have made it a keeper.  I seem to have liked it more than anyone else I'd encountered though.

This is the small box edition, and while it overhauls the rules (for the better I think), it also changes all the included units (for the worse). 

But it's still a great starter for the DT/DW world.

Also this is the only way to get the exclusive units found there in.

RATING: N/A
A cross between a CoSim and a miniature skirmish game, all played on a board and expandable with additional miniatures to form armies. The setting is the minimum weird I need, with walkers and retro-futuristic troops in the core set and expansions including things like gorillas, zombies or a chef with two flame throwers. However, while I like the game, the core set seems unbalanced to me.

One thing of note: I got my girlfriend to play this with me and she actually likes it. This is totaly outside of her preferred theme, but the mechanism and emergent tactics in this game made it interesting to her.

I'll need more plays to properly rate Dust Tactics. We played a small scenario for our first game and it was a quick and bloody affair.  It pretty much came down to initiative.  Determining initiative was annoying because we had to keep rolling-off. I'll need to use a couple of D6's next time.  Speaking of dice, the five provided in the game is not nearly enough.  I see the potential of the game, but I'll need to try the larger scenarios.

RATING: N/A
Open but unplayed.  Tiles in shrink and minis as they arrived in boxes/ plastic.  Dishing on bottom of box and crease along one side of the top because of the cheap cardboard the game comes in.  This is how it arrived from the OLGS and how I would assume that every one of these will look because of the cheap cardboard.

Bought the core set cheap to start Dust Warfare, but had a go and Dust Tactics seemes to be a smart fast wargame. Quite impressed on the first play. However in the few years the game has been around there have been 6 rule sets released all quite different. This stops me from buying into the game wholesale. The game is now owned by Battlefront (a company with good production and lousy customer service). Shame. Love this game.

RATING: 9.5
Dust Tactics Revised is a game where tactics truly matter, where cautionary, intentional movement utilizing cover is essential. There is a general feeling of intense anxiety to each maneuver during game play.

The experience quickly becomes more strategic after multiple plays and the amount of depth to the game at that point is impressive and perhaps surprising compared to how simply the rules are presented. The command squads are very helpful to additionally own in this regard (and my rating reflects including them) but the game is still eminently playable right out of the box when fielding all of the components from the core set.

This game usually provides a condensed and sometimes ruthlessly fast, lethal resolution that definitely won’t overstay its welcome and that also does not require a ton of additional units to thoroughly enjoy, but you will want them anyway because the game is that good and so are the components. This would likely be ranked higher on BGG if the command squads for each side were already included and the pre-painted models were less expensive.

(REVIEW FOR THE FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES RULES) You won't find another quick to learn, quick to teach, strategic board game with such amazing miniatures out there with so much value and depth. The miniatures are very well done, already primed and assembled. Tactics is all you need to have a blast. Adding miniatures will only add more fun (the expansions have their manuals available online). The other board game version, "2.0" from the new publisher, Battlefield, requires you to buy new miniature cards and will have you rolling ridiculous amounts of dice; just download it and implement the few new rules you like into 1.0 and keep having fun! (cards for the FFG 1.0 miniatures can also be found at the official Dust website).

E’ l’anno 1947. Attraverso il mondo, le tre superpotenze combattono per reclamare il controllo esclusivo di una rivoluzionaria fonte di potere: il Vk. Truppe d’Elite e mastodontici robot da combattimento si affrontano in violente battaglie per il controllo di queste riserve di energia.
Dust Tactics è un gioco da tavolo tattico con miniature per 2-4 giocatori. In una realtà alternativa che rivisita gli anni ’40, tecnologia aliena alimenta gigantesche macchine da guerra mentre le forze dell’Asse e gli Alleati si scontrano per aggiudicarsi rari depositi minerali che potrebbero inevitabilmente decidere il destino della guerra. 
Con oltre 30 miniature superbamente dettagliate, 2 mappe di terreno stampate su entrambi i lati, 6 dadi customizzati, carte unità, terreni.

You shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but this set has the poorest quality box in its class... Having said that, the rulebook has the merit of collecting all the rules from the previous expansions (except Operation Cerberus, which was released later), fixing in the meantime some minor flaws of the first edition.
The miniatures are excellent, as usual. I especially like troops in power armors: Axis ones have a distinct and believable Wehrmacht style, while Allied ones look very fifties.
In the the end, the revised core set improves playability, but the first edition had better materials: cardboard terrain tiles, more figures, four excellent medium walkers versus two light ones, more dice (and you often need lots). The best option, but not for your wallet, is buy both...

I love this game, it is so quick, dirty and deadly. I have started miniature painting because of it, something I had never considered before. My wife is not a gamer but she paints with me and my 6 year old son (was 5 when we started playing) loves the game as well, although he likes to play "with me" against the computer.

One friend has started collecting as well, but I am buying at least one of everything so I can host and so I can play now and in the far future with my son.

Price is high compared to the old core set, but that one is sadly out of print. Dust Tactics gets a 9/10 from me, but the core set could be better.

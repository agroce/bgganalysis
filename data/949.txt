[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

[b]I got a free copy of this from the Thrifting for You geeklist. Thank you![/b]

What can I say, this game holds up. There's a great deal of strategy and thought behind a deceptively simple ruleset. This game can be played with pen and paper, online, or with a board, and offers a lot of strategy that's stressful, brain-burning, and like chess/go in a way that I can handle. 

Played on a 24x24 board, Twixt has one rule: place a peg anywhere on the board. If you place a peg a knight's move away from another peg of yours, you get to add a link to the board between the two pegs. Links function as a wall that the other player cannot cross. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is simple: get across the board from one side to the other. Your opponent is trying to get across the board on the other two sides. 

Twixt carries a lot more depth than the rules might suggest. There are a million moves to block and disrupt the other player, and between good players the game very rarely devolves into a 'race' to the edges. A good player will know how to block his opponent in such a way to shift the initiative to his side. It's possible to lose a game in 10 moves, and it's possible for games to go on to 100 moves. There's so much depth waiting to be explored here, it's almost criminal that this game has been largely forgotten by board gamers. 

Yes, it's an abstract. Yes, it looks like a boiled turd. No, you won't look very cool playing it. But this is still one of the most challenging mental puzzles I've ever engaged in, and I look forward to playing this game for years to come, getting better at it, and maybe someday getting good at it.

I was introduced to this game when I was pretty young (about 10) by someone who told me it was one of the best games ever made, but in a voice that told me she was utterly bored with it.  She obviously liked it enough to bring it with her on a camping vacation, but quite opposite my visible enthusiasm she was clearly not enthusiastic to play it with me (though she had no problem playing it with her son about the same age as me, so it was not an age thing).  She agreed to play at my insistence, proceeded to quickly cut off my options and beat me quickly with mechanical efficiency.  Being beaten quickly did not bother me; it was her lack of emotion, as if she couldn't be bothered, that struck me.  I rate the game well because in my mind I know I should give it a fair shot again, but in my heart the game itself has taken on a sour note (admittedly a product of my own personality).  I remember this as lesson on how (or how not) to engage children (or for that matter, anyone who shows nascent enthusiasm in something).  Games teach us a lot about others and ourselves.

fabulous concept. You gotta think a few steps ahead in this one. Haven't picked up too many tricks since I don't get to play this very often and it's a bit of a brain burner. The pieces look fabulous and it's quite challenging because the tide turns quickly in this game and one mistake or one brilliant move is the difference between winning and losing. No luck here as well. The smarter player wins.

It's a compulsion.  Must...always...buy...AH Bookcase...games...found...at...thrift...stores.  Actually, in this case I'm glad I discovered Twixt.  A great abstract puzzle game that really makes the old gray matter spark.  No randomness.  You have to rely on your own spatial abilities to connect both sides while preventing your opponent from doing the same.  I've found you should never give up.  When one plan fails, you may discover a better way to block your opponent and take the win.  [Thrift $1.09]

I really like the idea of a connection abstract and Hex seems both too simple and too hard to recover when down.  This has a good amount of depth, strategy for a very simple rule set and although there is some fiddle in the idea of connections its not bad at all.  I still feel there is a connection game that I could connect with more than this but I have not found it yet.

Very fun abstract game.  The cover, with faint images of infantry in Vietnam has nothing to do with the game.  The game is an attempt to link a solid line across a pegboard, North to South while your opponent tries West to East.  Mutually exclusive!  There is a surprising amount of strategy involved, yet it is very easy and quick.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Initial impressions:

Not entirely sure just how deep the game is.  There are some interesting tactics in the first few moves, but in the first games, the game has been decided in about the first half-dozen moves.

I'll have to play some more to see how I like it in the end.

Very fast game, at least with this opening pattern.

It's an old-fashioned (1962) abstract game of connect one side of the square to the other.  It seems like it's a bit too calculable, though we did have some good plays of it that went back and forth.  I just think if one puts in a decent amount of time to studying the game then the variation is extremely limited.

One of the best connection games, using the &quot;knight move&quot; as the connection.  Huge first player advantage (as in Hex) can be compensated for by allowing the second player the choice of using the first play as his own.

RATING: 8
One of the most interesting abstract strategy game sI know. Doesn&#039;t take too long to play, doesn&#039;t rely on having memorised zillions of strategies and tactics, but with the power of a few simple patterns allows a lot of challening constructive and entertaining thinking that makes this game a joy to play. Definitely one of the all time classics in two player abstract strategy games.

Played several games against an experienced opponent, got slaughtered every time. As it should be, for an abstract. However, there are better abstracts out there to study, if I want to do so.

Hard not to think of Hex when you play this game. I hear the play is different, but as a rank amateur in both games, it feels like trying to set up chains and cutting people off from where they are going, as opposed to where they are.

For some strange reason, I feel that comebacks are more likely in Twixt, that you can switch the beat down back and forth more than once in a game before it ends.

May fall in further plays as it seems to be a deterministic stalemate.  Still, the process of reaching the stalemate is enjoyable.

Updated: More plays have revealed that the game is in fact far less deterministic, and that the balance of offence vs defence is more than a little subtle and controllable.  Lost one battle?  Move out to a decent distance and start another one!  Basic play seems to depend on ply analysis out to the three to four move level.  Highly confrontational, adaptive, reactive and requires  continual control of initiative.  In fact the fight for initiative often seems the core of the game.

I had a copy of this back in 1991, but I have no idea where it got to. I remember having some fun nights alternating between dominoes, chess and Twixt with my gaming buddy. That lasted for about 3 months. I never played Twixt again, however.

My recollections are that its a decent abstract game. The presentation of the game isn't as snazzy as the most recent abstracts coming out, but I don't think the gameplay is inferior.

Production: The sum of the parts forms an attractive post-game piece of art.  The pieces in my 3M version, when considered alone, are just cheap plastic, though.  Play: Fascinating connections game.  The L-shaped connections are tough to wrap my brain around.  I can see lots of opportunity for strategy and clever play.  My one playing was friendly, with my opponent and I preventing each other from making dumb moves, which resulted in a more satisfying yet more mentally exhausting game.  (1+0+3) (1 play)

For some reason this one just doesn't excite me, and I usually like connection games.  I certainly respect the design, I think it's pretty influential--quite a few connection games owe their existence to the inspiration that Alex Randolph gave their designers through Twixt.

This game was great when I first played at 11 or 12 years old.  But overtime it has lost its appeal because the strategies are few and it ends up feeling like a slightly more complicated version of tic tac toe in the long run.  But it's a great way to introduce pre-teens to abstract area control games.

A battered but complete red/black 3M version. The very first "grown-up" board game I ever played with my father, so it holds a particular soft-spot in my heart (thus the high rating; pull out the sentiment, and it's a 6 or so since there seems to be a decided advantage for whomever moves first).

RATING: 6
3M edition.  This a classic abstract design by legendary designer Alex Randolph, and it's deceptively sophisticated.  Though I haven't tried Go, I think there are probably similar strategies in that it pays to have some well-placed posts/fences around the board to join on to later in the game.

A sharp two player game. Requires a lot of forethought from the first game, off the top of my mind I can't think of a game that is more difficult to jump into. Seems to have a high barrier to playing proficiently. All and all an excellent game from another age of gaming. 

Next day: Thinking of this game quite a bit. Looking forward to another play, rating adjusted accordingly.

[5 plays] This is one of the few games I really feel neutral toward.  I wouldn't miss it if I never played it again, but if it appeared on the table right now I wouldn't mind playing it.  The only reason I have played it so much is that one of my gaming pals is obsessed with it and takes it with him everywhere, and I think I may be in a minority of people who are willing to play it with him.  He stomps me every time, of course.

I know it's not all he doesn, but I associate Alex Randolph with this kind of abstract game. I used to brood for days in my youth over this one, trying a) to find unbeatable strategies, and b) to come up with a good computer representation for it.

I suspect there are many strategies that will always fail and fewer that will always work.  Knowing when to give up in a race of two competing chains is the first lesson to be learned in this game; then, recognizing the power patterns that cannot be countered so as not to get in a losing position.  This game as a lot of depth.  My rating is not as high because I'm still undecided if I played it very often if the outcomes would not all look alike: oops made a mistake and the opponent has exploited it or vice versa.  Dunno, I suspect if I change my rating it will likely increase if I play more and better grasp the finer points of Twixt.

Classic abstract connection game. Like most (all?) better abstract strategy games it is - in spite of a really simple set of rules - somewhat opaque on first play and invites further study (unless you are easily frustrated or just can't get to grips with the spatiality, I suppose). Of course, that also pretty much means it requires further study if you want to get better at it which may or may not be a problem.

Twixt is very much the next step in "connection" games after Hex, if only a small step. Instead of adjacent spaces, it's spaces 2 and 1 apart (much like a knight's move in chess). The connections are marked with actual bridges. A very interesting game. Can feel a little perplexing for a player who doesn't have a good grasp of the strategies, but it plays as a perfect tactical game as well. Very much a game you need to play twice in a row just to make sense of everything. I very much like Twixt and it's one of the only connection games I own. A little basic considering the very interesting modern abstracts of my generation, but it a solid, pinnacle piece of abstract gaming from the 20th century.

Haven't played this in years. Pretty fun though. You just need to be the first to make a fence all the way across the board.

The key to success in this game is misdirection.  You must be able to disguise your plan with diversions but your diversions must not take up too many of your turns.  If your diversion takes one too many turns then you will be on the defensive.  If you are on the defensive you must depend on your opponent making a mistake  that causes your defensive moves to connect with a previously constructed fence.

Plays better with adults than with smaller children. 
I figured out a way of handicapping with the kids: They would throw a 1-2 dice before their turn to determine whether they placed 1 or 2 columns and their connections. They gave me a hard time simply for the sheer amount of connections the created against mine; But they still don't get this dry, abstract attack-defense strategy.

Plays fine with the wife, but will try again later with the kids.

Thrift store purchase, I also saw Phlounder and Breakthru also at the same $7.99 price, but I skipped those. The total would have been too much for one visit to a thrift store.
It seems they price their games according to the thickness of the box, so the 3M games get priced higher. Maybe they just look classier.

Anyway I went with what I figured was the best option.

I bought this from Sportmart back in the 70's, back when AH was the only game in town, along with Feudal. The game is simple to teach, but like Othello, requires a lifetime to master. The problem was, and is now, the game has a very steep learning curve to play well. Yes, one can start playing within minutes, but I can determine within one or two plays if my opponent has lost or not. What fun is that? Like Chess, Go, and Shogi, this game is not forgiving--one mistake is all it takes. Without a handicap, Twixt between a newbie and an experienced player is a terrible mismatch. Now, instead of destroying my opponents, I allow them to take back their moves and give hints, in an attempt to accelerate their learning and skill.

To play well, one cannot just rely on making simple 1-to-1 connections, but must thoroughly understand the four "setups" that are described in the rules. These setups allow a player to claim larger stretches of area (or the ability to make longer links) with two pegs. It takes more than a sitting to grasp this concept, and then it takes several more to exploit it fully.

In short, this can be categorized as one of the great "classic" games--simple, easy to learn, pure, but extremely profound in tactics and strategy, if one is lucky enough to find a worthy opponent (or is willing to take the time to groom one). However, this may be true of any abstract.

Update (02/24/11): Because of its deterministic play, it is almost unthinkable to bring it out during a social game night. If equally matched, the game is about tempo, or initiative, similar to Go or Shogi, but far quicker to reach the knife-edge boundary between winning and losing. Like Go, many battles may be fought all over the board, with really boiling down to who makes the first mistake. Great abstract, but woefully out-of-place within the context of other board games played during a game night.

Great memories playing this with my father growing up.  I recently recovered a copy from his house (he had 2) and look forward to teaching my kids and friends how to play.

Make sure to play with the "pie" variant where the 2nd player may choose to switch sides after the 1st player plays the first piece of the game.  This removes the advantage of going first.  It is called the "pie" variant after the parenting trick: one child cuts, the other chooses, and never before has a pie been cut so carefully!

Abstract games aren’t my cup of tea, but I tend to enjoy them from time to time. Twixt is a cool abstract game from designer Alex Randolph. I did like it.

The rules of the game are very easy to teach, you can teach them under 1 minute. Playtime is less than 10 minutes.

I had the 1968 edition of the game and its boards 4 move constantly, you need to find a way to keep the together while you play. When you play it, the board looks gorgeous with the plastic pieces on it.

The game can be played as deep as players want, you can also play it very casually, but there is a lot to consider in the game, its decision aren’t trivial. The goal of the game is to connect both sides of the board. I liked it but I prefer ConHex.

Bottom line, Twixt is a solid abstract game. I already sold it because I’m trying to get my collection under control but I would play again if requested.

Kosmos edition.  An abstract 2-player game of 'knight' like placement in an attempt to build and maintain a continuous connection across a 24x24 grid.  There seems to be a similarity to the games of Go and Chess in terms of gaining 'tempo' in movement.  It does, however, help to have at least an elementary understanding of the (5) various 2-peg 'setup' patterns to create doulble-linked connections (in one move).  I enjoy playing Twixt, though like GO, I'm not very good at it.

Played this two or three times on one day, and really didn't like. It felt like the first person to get an advantage would always win. An experienced player might be able to persuade me differently, but I didn't think enough of it to struggle through and work it out for myself.

RATING: 4
This is like someone took a magnifying glass to Hex and discovered there's a whole other topography printed on the board. There's clearly some strategic depth, although first you'd have to cut through the tactical basics where it's almost impossible to recover from a mistake. Would undoubtedly rate higher if I had any interest in studying to become a halfway good player.

One of the greatest connection games ever designed by a mortal being, with strategy as fluid and amorphous as oceans. Infinitely more complex than some of these other commenters will give it credit for. Unlike dozens of other connection games, the tactics here exist on a plethora of different levels simultaneously: a link's or a peg's position in relation to other links and pegs—including distant or unconnected ones—has profound implications for the ultimate offensive and defensive possibilities of both players.

When you consider the size of the board, the fact that links and/or pegs can be removed to create new avenues of possibility and connection, and the myriad of ultimately counterintuitive ways in which different combinations of pieces can eventually join up, block (either directly or indirectly), or coerce an opponent's placement, it quickly becomes clear that this abstract masterpiece offers a game-tree complexity dwarfing that of most other connection games, while at the same time rewarding and even requiring of its players both brilliance of tactics and deep creativity of strategy. In some ways this might even approach the epicness and depth of the immortal Go. Every time I play a serious game of Twixt, I find new facets and subtleties that I hadn't considered before. The game is mind-bendingly deep, despite its simple appearance and extremely elegant gameplay.

But, of course, you won't experience all that it has to offer until you've played against someone better than yourself, and had your mind blown by their superior tactics and strategy (6 or 7 turns into the game and you can already feel your imminent defeat). Some gamers hate such a harsh exactitude of victory and defeat, but Twixt is very easy to handicap, so this isn't a legitimate issue. Two novices playing this game will likely find little depth or beauty in it—frankly, they haven't yet had an ass-kicking to show them where to look.

This is probably the major reason why so many people underrate Twixt, insisting that it is limited or idiotically simple—two newbies play it once or twice, go through the stupid and completely futile motions of racing their pegs in a perfectly straight line to the edge of the board, and then they wonder how other people could possibly enjoy this game. This is something like playing a game of football where all the players on the field are required to hold hands the entire time, or playing a game of poker where all the cards are dealt face-up, and then complaining about how stupid these two games are. Yes, a lot of people who rag on Twixt have only played a sad and pointless semblance of it, and have really missed the whole game!

As a personal bonus, Twixt also reminds me of my awesome dad, who taught me how to play it when I was but a wee laddie. Huzzah!

Haven't really played this enough times yet to get any idea of its strategic depth (or possible predictability).

New in collection june 08. 3M Bookshelf version

I like this sort of short abstract and like the 'old' feel of it. But it's definitely not a modern day game so I guess I won't play it that often...

RATING: 4
Game in a Nutshell: An abstract where one player attempts to connect the North/South ends of the board while the other attempts East/West. Problem is, lines can't cross each others.

Played as: 2 player

Pros: Simple game to explain with a very simple concept to wrap one's mind around. Almost as easy as Tic-tac-toe but with a hint of Go's organic depth. I like the game pieces which add a nice retro-futuristic visual punch.

Cons: Too straight-forward for my tastes. I prefer a little more sneakiness to my abstracts and this one seems to play itself out plain as day. I imagine players that are equally matched coming to a draw more often then not; while an over-matched player is going to lose every-time.

Other: If you want to try out the game before buying, this could simply be played on a piece of graph paper with a couple different colors markers. My rating might be a little unfair given only one initial play, but compared to other abstracts (specifically two-player) out there, my interest quickly waned.

Best Use: I can see this game getting a lot of play in a classroom or with kids in the 10-12 years range.

Too abstract for me to want to buy it but I probably would play it again.

I am often surprised that people who have never heard of Hex have fond memories of Twixt. Does the box really smell nice or something? Finally got my copy on eBay - mystery remains unsolved. Very intriguing game; is further away from Hex, Y, Unlur, or Havannah than any of that group are from each other. Brashly raised my rating to 10 after two games, but in putting together my personal top ten, couldn't quite justify that. Tons to learn, though, and [i]could[/i] make its way back up to a 10, but only if I lose a lot more.

Perhaps this game is underestimated for its simple rules and because it may not look very exciting.
But in my view this is one of the best abstract games ever created. It is much deeper than meets the eye.

One of the best "light" abstract strategy games.  By "light" I don't mean that it's easy, just that it doesn't have the depth or richness of games like go or shogi.  It's still a lot of fun, and it's a good way to get people interested in abstract strategy games in general.

A classic connection game from Alex Randolph. It feels somewhat too restricted to me, because there are several predetermined patterns you can use to block the opponent.

One of those games where if you do not know the strategy, you will lose quickly.

Very good and quick tactical connection game. Rules are the simplest possible, gameplay is incredibly elegant. The game is primary tactic, although strategy is important expecially in the very first moves. It's incredible how a match can be lost for one single pin here instead of 1 point away. And it's even more incredible when, against a stronger player, you feel the same at move 2 or 3.

This is a neat abstract, and the only connection game I've played and really enjoyed (PUNCT, I'm looking at you). It's a game about building up threats more than direct competition, and the large space of the board encourages action in multiple areas. 

Note: I highly recommend the starting procedure where one player places a peg, and the other player chooses whether they want to play that color or the other. Otherwise, as in most connection games, the first player has a significant advantage.

March 2016: Updated from an 8 to a 10! When played with players of equal ability, one of the most tensest game experiences I ever had!

As it is a connection game (rather than a territory game like Go), game play is expectedly quick (it's easier to identify hopeless areas). 

The visualization skills required to identify how pegs link together add a richness missing in in Hex. (However, I think I should try Hex on really large boards, though.)

January 2013: Found a German copy at Essen the first time I was there.

Compared to hex, players have I believe four different versions of basic "unblockable" positions, as opposed to one in Hex, which adds a lot of tactical interest. However, there is some visual dexterity involved to see these kinds of positions, so the game doesn't doesn't move or flow as fast as Hex.

As with Hex and many other connection games, basic strategy involves spreading yourself all over the board at the beginning, then knowing when to back away from a section of the board you have no chance of dominating. However, because one single connection cuts off a large portion of the board, games tend to be brief and brutal. I think that the standard board is a bit too small for beginners have a chance to recover from early mistakes. So I suppose the only "flaw" with this game is that it takes up too much space :-)

OK, I bought a used copy of this one, and it sat on my shelf for over a year before I picked it up and finally tried it. I was a FOOL to wait so long! This game is very solid abstract strategy, similar in depth to the GIPF series. It's not as deep as GO, but has that same "chase, break-out" feel. It's subtle and simple, but plays so well. I have inducted it into my weekly gaming group, and there are about a dozen of us who play it well.

Rating for 3M version / ruleset only.

A well-regarded abstract game in the 3M bookshelf series that did very little for me.

The idea of the game is to connect your two edges of the board with each other, while your opponent does the same with his or her edges. As each of your moves must be both advancement and blocking, the game tends to devolve into chicken. Under the 3M rules, the person who moves first usually wins unless he or she makes an unforced error (a problem acknowledged even by the game's most die hard enthusiasts). Other editions use a pie rule for the first move, which I imagine improves the game greatly.

After playing Euros and block games, Twixt's plastic board and pieces are unattractive and do the game no favours.

Owing to its repetitive gameplay and low production values, the 3M Twixt has the dubious honour of being the only game I have ever left at an op shop (thrift store). I'm probably missing something not having played with the revised rules (seeing as so many people enjoy this game), but considering that you can get a wood and glass Go set from Chinatown for a few bucks I don't think that there's much of a place for Twixt in a modern collection.

Wow! What an intense, confrontational game of abstract strategy!

At first it seemed overly simplistic... until my opponent started to devise moves I didn't even consider. Many possibilities in this game. My favorite part is that you can recover from your mistakes.

Yes, it can easily lead to analysis paralysis. Yes, it is somewhat dry. But the mechanics are so devilishly clever you won't care.

Brilliant and interesting design, with nice pieces (but it is in sore need of a modern chrome update). Trying to make your own connection through building a "clothesline" before your opponent can. The weakness for me is there seems to be a lot of projecting moves into the future to their inevitable conclusion, making it very steep in that regard, as an experienced player would know how to defend against and utilize certain formations.

I would like this game more if each move didn't hurt my brain so much.  Every placement is agonizing. And just when you think you are winning...foiled again.  But because of that, it becomes absolutely absorbing.  A must have for abstract gamers who will commit to a hardcore game.

Found a copy at Origins for $5.  Looks neat.

For an abstract, I still find it pretty engaging. The people who I've played against can't say the same, though. They found it too dry or just flat out didn't like it.

Playing Twixt brings me the same sense of joy as when I play Hex. Twixt is essentially an elaboration on Hex, and feels very similar. Hex strategies port quite well. That said, the two games are different. Twixt requires precise counting of holes, which makes planning a more difficult, almost mathy, exercise. I can't say for sure whether there are enough difference between Twixt and Hex to justify studying both games, but the two are certainly enjoyable in their own right. I will gladly play either.

When I found this game in my dad's things I was instantly intregued. However after several different games with family members, I found the sucessful strategies boring--and if a game is boring to win I would hate to have to lose at it. It was a neat game to try but not one that I miss not owning.

This game seems relatively simple at first, and while to a degree that is true, the amount of strategy involved still separates the men from the boys.  This makes it a worthwhile and even sometimes great game for me, although I must say I haven't quite reached the "man" level.

Finally managed to get my hands on an affordable and pristine copy of the original 3M version of this gem.

If you like [thing=4112] [/thing], [thing=5242] [/thing], [thing=11997] [/thing] or [thing=2759] [/thing] you will probably like this game too. However, it is not quite like any other connection game I have played. I can see why it is told to be extremely tactical and confrontational - in a good way, from an abstract gamers point of view. A great "sport weapon of the mind" to use the term of Christian Freeling.

Dad gave me a new copy as a child for a gift on some holiday and I still have my original copy in my collection of all 3M games from this series.  This is one of my favorite really deep 2-player abstract strategy games.  There is a really interesting complexity that happens around each locus when trying to prevent passing.  This game will always hold its allure for me.

What an evil little game.  I can't see myself playing this very much and maintaining any sort of friendship with my opponents.  This is a game where the BGG rating system fails, because Twixt is a terrific game, but I don't feel like playing it very often at all.

This has become an inordinately large part of my life. I have flown across the Atlantic to play in tournaments. My license plate is TWIXT. This is a very tactical and confrontational two player abstract. As such, it's not everyone's cup of tea. But it's the most intense gaming experience I know.

An odd design - it's a connection game, but with some rather different tactics.  Sadly, it lacks the elegance of hex, or the depth of strategy of Havannah - it all comes down to a sharp tactical midgame fight.

Okay, I don't even like abstracts much, but I kinda like this despite myself.  This is very, very different from the kind of abstract I'm used to, in a very compelling way.  The non-linear aspect of the game makes it particularly tricky.  I've not played this much, but this is the rare abstract that has gotten a few plays, and still leaves me wanting to play it.  Obviously, this has earned its reputation as a classic.

Do not play this on one of the corner pieces to get the hang of stuff. It's impossible for the latter player to win. We made a mistake in doing this.

As an abstract I like it. It has a similar feel to [gameid=526], [gameid=3656] ect.

Is there anything special about it? No. It's a neat little abstract game with cool bits.

Twixt is an underestimated marvel. I play it seldom due to lack of players. Sigh. 
Strange thing about this game is that it should be fully determined. It probably is, but this is not proven yet, as with the other more familiar connect-borders-game Hex. But it is very much more interesting: a game can last for hours. Great!

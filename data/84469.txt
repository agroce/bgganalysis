Did not like.  Game seems completely dictated by the order you draw your building cards.  Market selling didn't have really any competitive feel to it.  Seemed to be a lot of fiddliness to managing the markets.  Getting a bunch of palace building at once blow, particularly when you are going to have to send some to the bottom of your deck.

Feels light in comparison to Friese's other games, which even at their heaviest aren't all that complex. This is a nice reworking of the deck-building, engine-building theme - not just a re-run of Dominion (as so many other deck-builders are) but something unique. It's not a ground-breaking game, but a very pleasant and nicely produced little oddity. Plays quick too.

Elaborating on my low rating:  This game seemed to be largely dependent on luck of the draw, but it didn't really matter after all.  I didn't get any affordable production in the first half of my deck, so I pretty much just saved my money.  By midgame, I had two palaces, a 3-production field, the crane, and the big bank.  Nobody else had any palaces at all.  I told everyone "I have no more decisions to make in this game, and I am going to win."  And I was totally correct.  By not doing much in the early game, I was able to save up to get the 3-production space and market, which let me just roll the rest of the way to victory.  YAWN.    NOTE: this was for the BASIC game.  The Advanced may improve things a bit.  Maybe.

RATING: 5
Another game about building an income generating engine and then timing the switch to building what gains you victory.  The interest in Furstenfeld is that what earns you victory is unproductive buildings that gradually replace production capacity, while  growing ever more expensive. I have to agree with those who claim that the way in which to accomplish all this is rather too obvious.  All that prevents you from implementing the perfect strategy is the luck of the card draw.

However, the real weakness of the game is the market.  It initially looks quite interesting, with different levels of demand for three commodities at different breweries.  However, in practice players sell goods wherever they can get the best price, rather than sacrifice income to manipulate the market.  Building production to satisfy demand for scarce goods is the one, obvious lesson of this market.

Production quality is to the usual 2F/Rio Grande standard.  The artwork is rather dull and unimaginative, though quite functional.

This game heavy because the memorability all the card in the deck is very important. This is the weakness of the game.

RATING: 8
Elegant, relatively simple rules and clever market price adjustments as typical for FF games.

The first few games are needed to get a feeling for the right time to start switching from production to building your palace: You either "fizzle" or end up with unnecessary piles of money.

Not a big problem though, as in a game with inexperienced players only everyone will probably start switching once the first player has started, so the one who abused the market mechanism best should still win.

Not as great for me as Power Grid, but more easily accessible. Will try this with the family to test if they could be ready for Power Grid.

RATING: 6
+ Looks nice. Easy to teach.
- The market is irrelevant. Everybody manages to sell, and +1/-1 on the sale doesn't make that much of difference after a certain point.  The rest is a mixture of deck rotation (and selection) with occupying spaces that were producing before. It's all about the timing (of when to lose your useful cards) and the cards you'll draw each turn (although you can mitigate the luck factor a bit). Want to play with decks? Play Dominion or one of its wannabes. Want to play an interesting game with a market? Play Planet Steam or Key Market. Yes this one's shorter, but what's the point?...

Essen 2010. A bit of a disappointment knowing the heights than Friedemann can achieve.  You harvest hops, barley and water.  New buildings help you obtain funds.  But demand is limited.  More goods, the lower the price.  Well constructed as usual from FF, but a lightly unsatisfactory and unsatisfying game experience.

Friedemann plus a beer theme seem a very interesting combo. And the "reverse Dominion" mechanic (you have a full deck and must get rid of cards) is quite intriguing too.
The game, however, falls short in delivering some of its promises: even when playing with the "expert" version (didn't consider playing the basic game after having read negative comments here on BGG) there is definitely something missing from the experience.
The game is not BAD, but it sounds more interesting by reading the rules than in gameplay... the theme is very thin, the market mechanic sounds clever but is very bland (everyone gets lots of money, and when players start to dismiss their engines to build their palaces, even the minimal competition vanishes), some early cards seem quite overpowered (early crane?)...
Would gladly play it again because it is a pleasant game when playing fastpaced, to see if my first impressions are wrong.

RATING: 8
Great game that is all about efficiency and timing. You must first spend money to build up an economy to generate cash, but the economy is only a means to an end. You must judge the appropriate time to stop building your economy and start building over your assets. Although approximately 2/3 of the deck is randomly drawn, careful planning is possible and essential. You must remember what order your palace cards are returned to the bottom of the deck. Additionally, remembering the order of the 9 cards that you place at the bottom of your deck at the start is critical. I would not bother to play the beginner game.

Yet another tableau building card game.  This one feels a bit more restrictive than some of the others in terms of cards, but adds a neat player-controlled economy.  The object of the game is different than other card games like this and seems to set up a definite timing aspect to the end game as your production and other benefits will be ramping down rather than ramping up as the game finishes.

It's early in the morning.  You sip your coffee.  As the hot, black, liquid washes over your tongue you look upon your farmlands.  You inhale deeply.  The smell of fresh morning dew on the grass intoxicates while pollen in the air scratches at the back of your throat.

"It's time to get to work", you exhale to no one in particular.  

Dreams of using the land to turn profits from the local breweries swim around in your skull.  That and dreams of wearing ass-less lederhosen while your neighbor, Broomhilda, spanks you with a wooden paddle.  It's a scary, messed up place that noggin of yours. But I digress.  With all of the beer profits you'll begin the process of slowly converting your plot of existence into a grandiose palace.  You'll live off the taxation of the people and spend your days guzzling steins of beer and ogling at the soft and bouncy physique of hired beer maidens.  

You arouse from the foamy, beer splashed, booby bar maiden reverie and realize that to succeed you'll need more than raw materials.  It will require manipulation of the demand at the breweries.  "Yes" you think,  "Olaf needs to be in my back pocket.  I'll drive up demand and charge triple the price!"  You'll have to act fast.  There are other farmers in the land who also wish to live out their days in luxury being hand fed bratwurst n' schnitzel while sharing drinks with giggling blonde women.  

"Make haste!  Time is of the essence!" you shout.  

Your trusty bloodhound, Duke, is the only creature that hears you.  He seems more committed to a deep cleaning of his nether-region than building an empire, but he is excited nonetheless!


Furstenfeld has no theme.  It merely has the window dressing of sending spring water, hops and barley to breweries via nice pictures.  The main board and game could be a rudimentary stock market game.  Regardless, the game is a well designed Euro game.  With it's basic economic engine you'll have to build on your small plot of land (only 6 spots) over and over again.  The real crux of the game is making money and then knowing when to go for palace buildings.  You see, once you build a palace on your land that spot is forever gone.  So as you get closer and closer to winning you have less money making options.  On top of that each player has the exact same deck of cards.  You play the game as a sort of "anti-deckbuilder".  Instead of starting with a small hand of cards and adding more, you'll do the opposite.  You start with a large deck and then thin it out and reorganize it your liking.  

The game is very subtle and it take 2-3 games to appreciate some of its nuanced gameplay.  In fact the rules start you off with a basic game.  Play one game of that and then move to the "expert" game...which is really the standard way Friese designed the game.  This game was drastically misunderstood because people never graduated to the expert game, but it's worth hunting down and checking out.  There are a multitude of strategies to try with all of the different buildings.  Plus the tension of knowing when to start constructing palaces makes for a great endgame race.  If you're looking for a rock solid Euro game that isn't a typical "point salad" or if you just want something out of the ordinary...track down Furstenfeld.  And hey, while the theme might be window dressing it still gets everyone in the mood for beer.  That alone is worth something.

Another great econ game from Friedemann. Which market to sell to is the one sort of automatic decision, but there are lots of ways to effect the the price of your goods otherwise. The deck-timing aspect is interesting, and the advanced rules go a long way toward giving control over how your palace cards will come out. Timing is key, in almost all major decisions, and the supply/demand market works very well. Looking forward to lots of plays of this one, and it clocks in at 60 mins no prob.

Edit: Played a 35 min, 4 player game today. The key is to take your whole turn, once you get to sell. So, once the guy in front of you sells, you Sell, Build, Discard, Draw, Produce. Sometimes you need to wait, but not that often. Works really well this way, and virtually no downtime.

Perfectly fine race type of game.  You convert resources to money and money to build better plots for resources or buildings to make you more efficient.  Your hand gives you the options on what you can build.  At sometime during the game, you have to start building palaces.  They do not give you any resources so it is a balance on when to do that.  It is quick and I enjoyed the tension of the game.  I am looking forward to playing it again.

As a family game, Fürstenfeld can be fun, but to be played seriously with gamers it doesn't. It has a dinamic gameplay that's fun, but at the end it seems that all is decided by luck in your card deck order.

My friend Biblio recommended me to try the advanced rules, I would like to try it and maybe my perception of Fürstenfeld change.

First play left with mixed feelings. I liked the basic concept of a game where you first build an engine and then destroy it to gain points.

What I did not like was the timing of the game where first you felt that there's nothing happening and then all of a sudden game was over.Market rules seemed also a bit weird and not very intuitive and realistic.

Leaning towards a 5 but need more plays to confirm the rating.

RATING: 8
An enjoyable game where you're trying to balance income with building temples.  Wife liked this one too on our first play.

There do appear to be some potential longer term problems:  both games we have played have come down to effectively same-turn wins, so it looks like the game converges onto a point.  

The "catch up" mechanism is also a little punitive I think.   There's not a whole lot of advantage of creating the most income, as you will be dragged back the next turn with identical income.   

There is also, it appears to me, to be a bit of an unbalanced mechanism whereby if the tourist bus card comes up at the right time (after 2 temples built?) you can play it and get a huge advantage.

Anyway, I do like the game, but think it could probably use a couple of tweaks.

So far I like this game a lot, but I could conceive of it getting old.  This is basically a race game, where you try to build all six palace cards to the appropriate spaces on your board first.  Every palace you build kills that space for production, though, so you need to time it right so that you have enough money to build the remaining pieces quickly.  The markets are simple to understand, and you can manipulate them very nicely.  In fact, what I like most about this one is that it's almost perfect information - most near-term decisions are quite calculable.  Last game I managed to get my palaces down with a limited number of other cards, so besides the market variability and the opposing player, it could stagnate with repeated plays.  Overall, though, I enjoy FF games, like this and Factory Manager, where he focuses on one mechanism in depth (in FM, it's tile evaluation, in this one, timing issues) and keeps the rest of the game simple.  I find this approach far more satisfying than the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink-and-yet-nothing-matters approach of Power Grid (which is 3 times as long).

Fast playing economic game. Too much luck in the card draw to make the game shine. Being limited to 6 buildings means that the engine doesn't build UP, it builds and then stagnates.  But the game is quick, so it's not a big deal.

This lovely game seemed to pass me by since it's release. But I got to play both versions of the game at So Board in Bristol. A very nice game where you have to build your useless pieces of palace to win but they take up a space that could have a much more productive building in. A fun balancing act. 2 Plays.

RATING: 6
Not bad! This isn't so much a deckbuilding game as it is a card tableau game with a dimishing deck of options and a market for goods. Sounds complicated, but actually the gameplay is very smooth. Basically, it's draw cards, pump out goods, sell goods, use that money to build more buildings, and rush to build the game winning buildings that will clog up your economy if you play them too early.

It's not a great game, it's not a bad game... it's a game I don't need to own but that I'll gladly play.

A really unique and interesting take on hand management and tableau building with market and money management aspects to it. Randomness of the draw seems to be less of a factor with the way the deck and hand management works. Interesting element of engine building convert to victory point race seen in Dominion but without the plethora of expansions, the game may not have as much replayability.

Decent components with unique shapes and okay eurostyle art. Fiddly to manage the market tracks on each brewery. Pasted on theme.

EDIT: This game is even better after a few plays. The mechanics of the game are such that everyone could eventually achieve the winning condition (6 palaces built)... but you have to finish first. The pace of the game accelerates and there are definitely several ways to try to win. Great stuff.

- - -

This surprisingly fast-paced game looks like it would be a little dry, since at first it appears that it's all about supply-and-demand of three goods (with prices rising or falling with the market).

However, each player has a farm area with only 6 spaces to build on, and winning the game involves building palaces on all 6 spaces. (Palaces, humorously, produce absolutely nothing.) As the game progresses, you cover your fields and useful buildings, requiring you to accomplish more with less space.

Lastly, each player has the same 26-card deck of buildings, which cycles throughout the game (so if you have to discard an important palace or building, it won't appear again until you cycle through your deck).

As I said, the pace was really quick, downtime was minimal even with 5 somewhat AP-prone players. Three kids, aged 8, 10 & 13, really loved it. (And two of them were convinced it would be a lame game.)

A lot of fun.

Why don't people like this game? We had a blast with it. There is some luck to it (we played the beginner game) but you can try to time your moves just right to mitigate the luck.

Players are farmers harvesting goods, and selling them to the local breweries for cash.  Cash is re-invested into infrastructure, and ultimately palaces for the farmer!  Neat little market/deck manipulation game, were players drill through their own deck (all identical) trying to get the most out of their six building slots on their play mat.  Slots can take fields, which grow crops (sold for cash at the local breweries, affecting prices), or special buildings that earn other cash, allow deck manipulation, etc.  Six of the cards in the deck are palaces, and the first to build these wins the game.  However, building palaces take up your six slots, and get more expensive, gradually whittling your income down.  Really nice, playable game that is almost a super-filler.  Looks like there are several strategies to try - very impressed.

It’s been a while since I’ve seen a game as fiddly as this.   Not necessarily a bad thing, but the wooden bits are flat and hard to handle, especially when you are manipulating 12-15 different markettracks.   Gameplay combines a clever supply/demand mechanism with something like an inverse deck-building game.   Deck culling, I suppose.   The main constraint is that you only have 6 slots to put your buildings, and there will be a constant struggle between over-writing them with something new or milking them for just one more turn.   In the end, it comes down to an engine building game but sometimes inefficiency can get you benefits in the turn order, which can be huge.   The theme is odd and doesn’t quite work for me - offices, palaces, tour busses, and breweries?   The main complaint, however, is that there is no mechanism for shuffling your deck.   If you draw all of your palaces in one hand (as I did) you are completely hosed and there isn’t a solution.   If one of the buildings allowed a shuffling or card searching option, the game might work better.   Bottom line - some cool twists on overused mechanisms, but it lacks polish overall.

Friedemann Friese's big box game from Essen 2010.  A kind of a reverse Dominion as you thin out your deck, and produce/sell resources to build buildings with special abilities.  Very impressed after nearly a dozen plays - the Advanced game seems to be the best way to play.  This game seems to have been hurt by negative comments from people who have only played the beginner game, or just played once or twice.  Note that the Advanced game is really intended as the Standard game, and the basic game is just a simplified beginner version to help learn the game (see Friese's post [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/article/5827834#5827834]here[/url], as well as his comments about the correct way to play [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/article/5822119#5822119]here[/url]).  See my ideas for strategy in playing the advanced game [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/613699/how-the-advanced-version-changes-the-game-impressi]here[/url].

Turns deck-building into deck-unbuilding, and adds a fun market mechanism.  It's very decent for a light economic game despite having a thin theme, and for something that plays in 45-60 minutes, it offers a considerable dose of fun. Particularly with the advanced game, there are more hand-management and deck-management decisions than meets the eye, as well as more control, and if you do enjoy the interaction of the market system, you'll find a great deal to enjoy here!

I enjoyed it, although I lost badly. It's fairly solitaire but there is inter-action in the selling decisions and watching what your opponents have built. But it's mainly a money race and deck-handling game. I suspect a certain luck in your card draws makes a difference, but really it's much more about building the right things at the right time, and not squandering your cash. I was surprised at how much you could achieve on so few building plots.

Market manipulation combined with hand/deck management.  Is it any wonder I like this game?  I won't know what kind of legs it will have until I play the regular game but for now it seems like a winner.

My only concern is that after a handful of plays it will seem boring until there is a card expansion.  This is just based on my experiences with deck building games however.

Recent purchase from "The Works".  I have high hopes for this one as it looks like it has the market mechanism from Power Grid.

...and now I've played it.
There's a reason these games are for sale at very low prices in the works.  This one is a decent enough game with nicely produced components. 
I'm struggling to say anything really positive or negative about the game.  That's it in a nut shell I guess.  The game is "ok".

Is a deck-building game where if the cards align just right you don't even have to go through your deck once still a deck-building game? The deck-building aspect really only begins to matter when the cards turn up in the wrong order, and that very likely means you have already lost anyway.

Admittedly, I'm exaggerating a bit but initial card order is vastly more important than anything else. The stock market is pretty nice, though. You have a couple different markets, and each has a certain demand for each good. If the demand is met nothing happens, if not the price rises. If the amount of goods sold exceeds the demand prices drop. Simple but surprisingly effective.

Unfortunately, the market isn't too important, either, because the inbuilt catch-up mechanism (player with lowest income last turn goes first, can sell for best prices and possibly trash them for later players) means that you are often oscillating between rounds with high and low income which makes trying to manipulate a market for personal profit rather pointless.

The game is pretty short, though, so some of the issues don't weigh as heavily as they may sound.

Fast and fun little economic game from Friedemann Friese my favorite designer. Full of interesting choices e.g. when to build palace tiles (bring you closer to victory but restrict moneymaking opportunities), what buildings to build, which factory to sell to. It's growing on me and I can see many more plays in the future, especially since it goes much faster than Power Grid.

Deck-building, set collection and commodity speculation in one. Some clever mechanisms making the game extremely replayable and pretty fast gameplay make it a good game. Too much of calculating for my taste but I still had a good time playing it.

I am little concerned about the longevity of this game, but as of now I quite like it and want to play it more. The game is about supplying goods to the local breweries in order to build a palace. You sell ingredients you produce to one of the breweries to get income and prices changes due to supply and demand. After that you allowed to build up to two buildings by paying the cost and place it on one of your six spots. The buildings are a deck which you draw from every turn and the buildings you don’t build are placed at the bottom of the deck in any order, which means they are recycled. Palace parts are like other buildings (but get more expensive as more are taken), so one of the main decisions in the game is when to switch gears.

Market manipulation games are not a personal favorite, but maybe because it is quite simplistic make it easier for me to like it and comprehend. Instead this is more of a hand management game, especially with the advanced game which involves some deck building (nothing like Dominion though). As I said earlier I’m not sure about how it stands up with repeated plays mainly because of concern about the balance of the buildings, but the game feels fresh and fun.

Good game about running an Estate. Unusual twist in game mechanics as you have to draw cards at random and then plan future turns by showing unwanted cards to the bottom of your deck in any order.

RATING: 8
A great mix of market manipulation, economics engine, and long-term planning in a very short game. 

Players develop personal estates by planting crops for resources or erecting buildings for other game benefits. Selling resources earns money which is spent to upgrade the estate. The trick is that to win the game, you must fill your estate with parts of a palace. Each part replaces something useful and produces nothing. This makes it very important to know when to shift from earning income to pursuing victory.

Playing the Basic game will give a feel for the mechanics, but I think most gamers could jump right into the Advanced game with no trouble, and probably should.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Preliminary rating after one game (where most players were rather tired).  This game is something like: economical optimization meets Dominion.  Players start with identical decks of cards.  There are basically three types of cards:

- Cards which generate 3 different goods (which can be sold for money)
- Cards which modify the generation, prices or handling of the goods.
- Victory cards (6 cards total)

During the game, cards are played on the table where they stay permanently.  The goal of the game is to bring all 6 victory cards on the table.  To play a card on the table costs money and money can be earned by producing and selling goods.  Unfortunatly, each player is only allowed to have 6 cards in play so as soon as someone plays his 7th card the new card is placed atop of an already played card.  

This generates a nice new twist because you need to plan when an how to bring your card into play and when to deactivate them by playing new cards.

Overall the game is quite ok but now as fast and elegant as Dominion.  Furthermore it is a little bit too much "multiplayer solitaire" for my taste.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun game with a deckbuilding touch. Buying and selling stuff isn't new, neither is a changing market. So, this game doesn't offer anything new, but it's easy and fast.

It's mostly about timing, as you want to sell at the highest price, aswell as you want to build up your tableau to win the game. That however means less space for your other buildings that you need to get resources.

Some extremely clever ideas here. It starts out an economic engine game, but gradually you are forced to turn your useful (money-making) buildings into useless buildings that are necessary to win the game. That forces some very tough and interesting decisions. Hope to play this again soon.

Oddly, this is much closer to Power Grid than Factory Manager was, because it is really about the market (although supply, rather than demand, is the focus here) and because, with your limited production facilities, you want to make sure that you are doing something that all your opponents are not also doing.  These are both aspects of Power Grid that I enjoy, and I liked them here too. I also enjoyed the special powers that the cards gave, and the timing aspect of the game that comes from deciding when to switch from production to the pursuit of victory. There is a definite element of card-counting to the game, which I didn't enjoy as much, and I think it is a shade too long, but on the whole I liked it. (1 play)

This isn't the deepest game ever but it's fun to try to manipulate the markets in your favor and to your opponents' detriment. There's really only one tough decision to make in the game, and that's when to start building your palace. Start a turn too soon or a turn too late and you might not have a chance at winning. Still, it's fun for a medium-light game.

Uninteresting.

This is a very mediocre game with only one interesting decision: when to switch from expanding your economy to making steps (building parts of the palace) towards a victory.  Besides that the game is mechanical, very repetitive and lacks and any tension and agonizing decisions whatsover.  It almost plays itself.
Markets/demand/supply are not working too - you can always sell at good price.

I don't care about the advanced variant.  It might be slightly better from what I've read, but I don't see how it could significantly improve the game in my eyes.

Interesting market mechanism, and the trade offs with what existing builds/fields to build over and timing.

Loses points though in the random order of the initial card individual decks... I feel if you have a building crane in the 1st turn you can build you are in a much better position as early on that $2 per build adds up

Okay game, not amazing but pretty good. It has some cute mechanics but I don't love the race to fill the board aspect. Things can be a bit random with the deck. The decisions kind of disappear after a few rounds when everyone switches to building palaces as fast as possible. The game could be auto-played at that point but instead we have to wait and see if randomness throws us for a loop or not.

Given the length this isn't too bad, it can be fun and light-hearted but it's lacking in the serious strategy department.

RATING: 5
Friedemann proves again that his creations are hit or miss. This time it's a miss. While the game suggests various routes to victory, the strong and weak buildings are rather obvious. Even on our first play one of us found a strong combo that seems hard to beat. Build an early construction building (if you're lucky to have it in your first or second hand), build three resource fields as soon as possible supported by the building that lets you convert resources to another resource. Add the bank somewhere in between to accumulate enough money that you can build two palaces each round. Once you figured out the few strong combos, it's more about luck in the deck distribution than clever play. Too obscure and fiddly for occasional play, not interesting enough for gamers. The drab design doesn't help. A real shame since the design is a selling point in Power Grid or Factory Manager. Nothing more to see here, move on to something more replayable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The game that finally convinced me that Friese is just pushing crap in a green box to the market as quickly as possible.

Basically this is a game where at the start you randomly determine whether a player will need to go through his deck 1.25 or 1.5 times (people who are lucky enough to draw an early cheap production building or a bank can get sustainable income sooner). Once your income is high enough, you just stockpile money and build every single palace that you draw. The only thing that matters is how far into the second pass through the deck you need to go.

The market mechanism is very fiddly, but has no real effect on the game. All the players will be swimming in money anyway  for most of the game.

I don't understand who the target audience of this game is. Gamers probably would like a game where they have at least one meaningful decision to make during a game. Casual gamers probably don't want a ridiculously fiddly resource market. Perhaps it's people who want to look like they're playing a complex game?

We played another game with the advanced rules to see if the game was hiding there somewhere, but no: it really doesn't exist. And I don't think there's even anything there that can be salvaged. It's really a game construction kit with nice vegimeeples.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My rating is probably a little harsh, but for some reason I don't feel inclined to play this, even though my plays thus far have been enjoyable.  I think that the game just feels like it should play in a shorter amount of time.  So far I think they've been around an hour, and 30 minutes seems about right.  There is quite a bit of luck involved in the deck order, as certain combinations can be quite powerful.  But this doesn't bother me that much.  I think the main problem I have lies in the excessively fiddly market adjustment.  When you start the game it seems like it would be really important, since it occupies the whole central board.  But it seems like you can usually make the money that you need to make with just very minor differences in income.  Those minor differences are fine (and seem more meaningful) in a heavier game, but in one that should be as quick and light as this, moving the pieces on the market is just annoying.

Won at Euroquest 2010!!!

Tentative 7, played with 2, 3, and 4; best with 4 so far.

Interesting game of weighing using the bonus cards for their advantages versus saving the money to create a pool and eventually build the monuments.

It's kind of like starting a deck building game half way through but with a stock market mechanism and tableau management. Totally unexpected and much better than I had first believed.

I'm totally uncertain of any firm strategy but I can certainly say that as long as this is played at a 45 minute maximum then it's a fine game.

Update:

The advanced game makes this one a 9. It's worth playing the basic rules to understand the game, the buildings, and the overall flow of the game.

Playing with the advanced rules makes the game shorter, much more intense, and previewing 1/3 of your deck, then seeing additional cards and brings your total to seeing half your deck, allows for some serious planning, precognition, and if your memory serves you well, strategy.

I'm certain this game will fool most into thinking there's nothing there at all. I find it a shame when games use the basic version as the default when the real meat and potatoes is listed at the end of the rules as an advanced version.

Update:

Repeated plays really show this one as a consistent performer both as a game and in plays with our group.

Simple euro. Rules are good but then have one or two translated parts that are unexplained. Had same problem with first sparks. Got this one right though.

It's ok. All about deciding when to use engine to build place that destroys the engine. First player is vital for getting most for goods but with 2 player game found that there is little variation on the pricing and after a few turns some things wedged firmly at the top.

Crane seems a over over powered building and if you don't get your basic crop cards in first few hands you can't do anything.

This could be an example of where the rules were not clue though.

And indeed it is- from now watching some videos these cleared up these points but should not have to watch video to get the rules right for such a simple game.

This is a very tight game where you build up your engine to pump out money then tear it down to build up you victory buildings. Seems like it is Friedeman's take on a deck building game except you don't actually build a deck but use a preconstructed one the same as everyone else's. It's how you streamline it to get at what you really want. I see this one easily having a dominant strategy in the end.

The devastatingly negative smackdowns of Fürstenfeld here on the Geek will steer any believer in swarm intelligence far away from it. Recent experience has turned me into a firm believer in mob stupidity, so scores of Essen attendees immediately disliking a game served more to intrigue me. After all, this could be another example of a game that was ill received because it deviated a bit from what the self-declared cognoscenti expected to get. For trying something new, in other words.

And turning the deckbuilding idea on its head to create a deck-dwindling game, where you’ll often build weaker stuff just to get rid of it once and for all, is new and also appears to work very well. The market mechanism is a bit by-the-numbers in comparison, but as it introduces the interaction that the interesting part of Fürstenfeld necessarily lacks, I’m okay with it.

After a single game, I feel sure that the game is varied and complex enough that all criticisms about too much luck or hopelessly unbalanced cards, can be summarily dismissed. I very much doubt that any of them have been written from a perspective deeper than a single game. What Fürstenfeld actually might lack is a bit of sparkle, though, because the combination of solitarily min-maxing and somewhat fiddly commerce can feel a bit dry. Personally, however, I certainly remain intrigued, and hopefully can give this another spin soon.

This one's grown on me.  Got to say I admire FF's creativity  - he always seems to be going for something new and quirky, which may not always hit the mark, but hey, got to give the bloke his due for pushing himself and the games he designs.
For me Furstenfeld works brilliantly as a fun, light, quick game for a fun, light, quick session.  Scales well, has top-of-the-range components and will sit very nicely in my collection alongside Fearsome Floors if not Power Grid.

Firstly you product raw material that you sell breweries and then build palacies with money what you get from there. Simple and quick. This is just ok game and has nice market mechanic. Nothing special.

I like the mechanism after one play. Rating may go up or down, there is more to explore. I won, but it is hard to tell why. The cards have to show up in a better order than they do with your neighbours. Some luck, skill too, but that requires more plays I assume.

Given that I'm not that fond of Dominion, it did not come as a big surprise that I was not grabbed by Fuerstenfeld, either. There is less cards to be drawn and no shuffling, but one has to fiddle with the resource bits instead.

A commodity market and building game.  Players have 6 parcels of land that can produce goods, provide money (banks) or discounts on buildings, etc.  There's also various markets where one can sell goods based on turn-order which is determined by who made the least amount of money in the last round.  To win the game you need to build 6 palace buildings.  The problem is that the palaces do not produce anything and you only have 6 parcels of land.  Furthermore you have a stack of building cards and a hand limit, cards that you do not keep in your hand are pushed to the bottom of your stack (to be built later).  Cycling through your deck for the right buildings can be very important.  

I thought this game was just OK.  The market is not too exciting and there seemed to be a bit of luck in when particular buildings come into your hand.  The game works with some interesting ideas but I found it a tad boring.  Will try again with an open mind someday.

I liked this game for a while, but the luck aspect rubs me the wrong way. Which is not to say that it's primarily a luck-driven game. I suspect the better player will usually win. However, you can often feel hobbled by a bad shuffle, which drains the fun right out of the game.

What seemed like an interesting game devolved into a luck-of-the-draw experiment. If your cards come up right, you'll do well. Otherwise, you'll struggle. All my castle cards were bunched in the middle of my deck, which meant I had no chance of winning.

Liked the game. I had the feeling that there were too many markets out for our game as the prices of all the good rose quite quickly and there was no real struggle to get money and therefore the game devolved into a race to get the six parts of the palace out.

It would have been nice to have some decisions to make about storing goods vs selling at current market price.

Nice game though.

I have a feeling the strategy in this game is simpler than it leads on, but I like this game on initial play: The hard part is deciding when to make the sprint for building out your castle.  There's a weird handicapping system that makes it more difficult to complete the system, and yet everyone's sprinting for the castle before they're forced to pay extra for the privilege.  Very clever, FF.

Engine building game where you have buildings and farms to produce the ingredients for beer. I'd be interested in trying this one again, since it's really about balancing infrastructure with production with victory points. You have six spaces in your area, each can house one building/farm/victory building. The goal is to get all six victory buildings out, but for each one you bring out, you reduce your available working spaces by one.

RATING: 5.5
·) The game pieces are great, but not practical (they are not easy to pick up)

·) The rules are simple, easy and fast to teach/learn

·) Not prone to AP; the game flow is fast and there are not dead moments

·) The luck of the draw is quite a bigger factor than strategy. 
-> Getting the Tour Bus in the good moment is very important -> luck
-> If you have to discard a palace piece after turn 2-3, you're out of the race; only labs can save you (usually people wins towards round 10-11, and decks have 28 cards)
-> What fields people build and how they sell (both things you can't control) are also very important
-> The more palaces you get on turns 3-6, the less likely you are to win.

·) Still, the game is unforgiving, if you commit an error, chances are that you'll be out of the competition, especially after the first 3 turns.
-> If you go for palaces too soon, you will need many extra turns to build the last pieces -> you're lost
-> If you let a palace piece go once the game is advanced, you're a goner too.

·) Important learning curve; chances are that someone will win on turn 11, you need to make sure you'll have finished in turn 11 and have as much money as possible (finishing in turn 10 is quite difficult, you need luck for that), and you need to know when to build this and that building.

·) Limited replayability. After a few games, you've seen it all, you've exploited all the strategy the game has to offer and you just play for the luck of the draw.

·) Memory is key. You need to remember your discards! Especially the palace pieces: you need to know when you'll draw and each of their number (in order to know where to place the important buildings)

·) The market is not as fun as it first seems. Almost always you'll have a best option and most likely you will go for that. It's very easy to identify. There's not a lot of interaction there

·) IMHO, some buildings are useless (ie: town halls can keep you in the game when you get several palaces in the same draw, but building them will drain your resources and will keep one of your six spaces occupied -> you will not be able to compete with the other players; the Scavenger won't be worth the while, unless you build it on the 1st/2nd turn, because you'll only go over your whole deck to get a few cards).

Basically, the game drinks on good ideas, but the gameplay doesn't confirm them. And it's not fun.

RATING: 7
First impression (5 players): I kind of like the idea of the deck you go through and build stuff from but the markets felt a bit too bland and uninteresting for the most of time. Probably most interesting design choice is the way you win by building 6 palace cards to your 6 available places but when you build those cards you're also blocking any useful things you could've built there.

Probably best with 4 players as then the market is still lively enough and there is less of a risk somebody monopolizing one goods type. The fifth player seems to add mainly just more downtime to the game.

An utterly delightful economic game - Power Grid with a twist of lemon, if you will.

The value tracks and the phase ordering are strongly, STRONGLY reminiscent of PG. But delving further into the game reveals the deck management that inspired Dominion and all its ilk. Indeed the Player Aid is little more than a short summary of all that is great about Dominion. How is it possible not to appreciate that?

I imagine Furstenfeld will remain easily the best among Friese's creations for a long time, as far as I'm concerned.

It works nicely enough, but it's just repetitive and the endgame seems overly luck based given its nature. You start with an income engine of 1 of each of the 3 different resources, which you sell in one of the markets. Each market gives a price for each of the 3 resources which will go up if under-utilised and down if under-utilised. With the income, either buy one of the 3 buildings in your hand onto your personal tableau or save your money. Each player has an identical deck of building cards, and the decision each turn is whether to build one of these or hope for better cards next hand. With only 2 drawn each round, you're either going to get lucky and get buildings you can afford for a strategy you've started down, or not. Anyway, your aim is to initially produce a lot and make lots of money, and the buildings will produce more goods or reduce building costs or allow you to churn faster through your deck or warehouse goods from turn to turn, you get the idea. Eventually you need to make enough money to afford to be able to replace your income engine / buildings with the 6 non-producing palace cards, first to do so wins the game. As you get to go through your deck several times, if you work at it, you can remember exactly when those palace cards will re-emerge into your hand and save accordingly. I'm not sure I want to work that hard. The defining question turns out to be will that final palace card re-emerge from the deck just when you're cashed up and in a position to build it or will you be forced to wait a bunch of turns for it to come out and will someone else get luckier with their timing? That seems a lot of end-game luck. The building decisions / strategy you choose can vary quite a bit, but it's driven by what comes up in your deck early and what you can afford. At least they provides a measure of interest in continued replay. But the rounds are endlessly identical - income, sell, build/save, income, sell, build/save - and I'm just not sure it's an end-game I want to rely on once I've invested 60 minutes in a game.

This is a game similar in the feel as "Havanna" and "Dominion" played backwards. Instead of building a deck the players try to get rid of the unwanted cards without spending to much money on this! :) This is my first impression. Very nice effort!
Update: After one year and only a second play I have to lower my rating! This is still a good game, but it felt too easy for me to win the expert game with the right starting hand combination! The others had no possibility to surpass me. And the market is overly complicated for what it offers. Could be more streamlined. Still it is fun to build my deck! A solid 7.

RATING: 6
This is a pretty simple supply-and-demand game, where you must sell all of your goods to one of a number of breweries, each with its own price track.  The interesting part was the deck of buildings, containing cheap production buildings, expensive production buildings, buildings with special abilities, and scoring buildings.  Buildings you draw and don't play go to the bottom of your deck, and you only have 6 spots to play buildings on your board (though you're free to replace unneeded buildings you played previously).  The goal is to be the first to get all six scoring buildings out, so while they just take up room on your board at first, you don't want to put them on the bottom of your deck too often, or you'll never be able to find them when you need them.  On the whole, however, I found the game to be very repetitive after a while, like I was doing the same thing turn after turn, waiting for the right cards to come up.

The market in this game is incredibly cool.  I also like the idea of trimming your deck as you go (rather than "deck-building"), it's an interesting twist.  Of course, trying to maximize your yields before you "go out" and build over all your useful stuff is a very interesting tension.

An interesting topic for a game, but ultimately underwhelming. The game just isn't remarkable.

Captures the market manipulation aspect of Power Grid with the infrastructure development of Argicola and adds it's on finite space restriction to further tighten the balancing act. Like Power Grid, it's very balanced and feels 'fair' above all else. It's also a faster paced game with less AP potential and downtime. 

That said, having had some time to think it over, I think it lacks Power Grid's excitement. Maybe it's the lack of 'stacks'o'money' or the removal of player blocking moves or maybe it's just a bland theme but it doesn't grip me as hard.

Still, an excellent game.

The good news is that it's very easy to learn and quick to play. It's enjoyable enough, but unfortunately the decisions just aren't tough enough and once you've built your initial engine there's even fewer decisions to make as you tick along searching for your palace cards. Once you have gone through the first half of the deck you've probably made your bed and now there's just not that much to do.

It's a pity, because it feels as though the game could have been a very good one. Some sort of incremental building and maybe some buildings providing some player interaction would improve the game.

Played the basic game once with 5P. In this engine-building game, players produce and sell goods to the market for cash, which in turn is used to construct buildings on personal player boards. Buildings come in two flavours – either they provide effects which assist the player, or they are palaces, which do nothing. However, the first player to fill his or her personal board with palaces is the winner. This creates an interesting dilemma as players have to carefully choose buildings to shut down to make way for palaces just as the engine begins humming along. 

Still, I thought Fürstenfeld was a little underwhelming. For one, it is not a game of deck manipulation, as the game ended barely after going through the deck once. Rather, the order in which you draw your cards is likely to decide your next move as you cannot really count on seeing those cards again.

Secondly, the market mechanism is curiously superfluous. Despite players' efforts to manipulate the market, there is always at least one market that offers a bargain for each player from mid-game onwards. Consequently, there isn't much incentive competing for turn order unless you intend to build palaces before the cost to do so increases. This might be a good game if you enter with the right expectations, but so far the supporting mechanisms leave the game feeling flat for me.

This is one of the most "slapped on" themes for a game that I've ever seen.  The pretense of growing beer brewing ingredients to sell to breweries is completely detached from the goal of being first to build a castle.  However, the game mechanics are interesting enough and it is a unique blend of an economics and engine-building.

Nice light economic engine deck management game.  Does just what it should and clocks in at about 30 minutes if everyone knows what they are doing.  The simple market works and managing up your lots is entertaining. I fear that there may be an optimal card combo that would weaken replayability (the crane that lowers the building cost seems too powerful for those that get it early), but for right now I'm happy to explore it until it reveals itself.

1 play, 2er, basic game.

Interesting economic, hand-management game with some deck-building elements in there as well (advanced game). The market mechanism is nice: simple, and it works well. Turn order is similar; and I do like games where you can fiddle with turn order to try to get an advantage! Like many other games, you have to figure out when to transition from producing goods and making money, to spending the money to build palaces (which will decrease your ability to make money in the future, by covering the relevant buildings). Having to work with a randomized deck means that the game should play out a bit differently each time.

I quite enjoyed it ... need to try the advanced game!

--- Summary (Basic) ---
Each player has their own deck of cards. These show production areas (2-3 water, grain, or wood?), buildings that modify the basic rules (change hand size, number of cards drawn, build costs, etc.), and 6 palaces. 

In the basic game, the deck is shuffled and players start with a hand of 3 cards. Each turn, draw 3, then harvest goods based on the goods-producers on your play mat (6 spaces, 3 empty and 3 with production at start of game). Then, in turn order (lower income last turn goes earlier), go to a beer hall to earn Income: sell any goods you choose. There is a pretty clever market mechanism here: each hall has a different combination of goods that it demands. Each turn, unmet demand raises the price of that good; oversupply reduces the price. Next, build any cards you choose in those 6 spaces (covering any building already present in a space). Finally, discard all but one card to the bottom of your deck.

The first player to build all 6 palaces wins (tie breaker = cash?)!

With six places to sell, it's not so much a matter of manipulating prices of the three commodities as of simply taking advantage of the best prices available when your turn comes around.  I have found the "Market" to be overwhelmingly the most powerful card in the deck and exercised that last night to run away with it.  (The income chart tops out at 25, and I had income of 29 on one round.)  It's an interesting enough activity for the amount of time it takes, but with players who know what they're doing, luck of the draw rules.

Mmmmmmm. Beer. The game? a bit flat. A bit of stock market, a bit of deck building , a bit of a race.

The stock market felt fiddly yet uninteresting - the decisions seemed obvious; it would take a dedicated gamer to care whether it was worth sacrificing a couple of coins to cause another player to lose a couple of coins. The "deck building" didn't matter because you weren't going throughthe deck often enough to care whether things like deck thinning could help. The race to build your palace didn't seem to involve many decisions either.

I only played the simple game (where palace cards can be placed anywhere, in any order) but extrapolating my first play to the advanced version doesn't fill me with a sense of urgency to try it again.

Mediocre resource management Euro. Players adopt the roles of landowners selling resources to breweries with the aim of upgrading their land until they are inn a position to build a palace. Each player has only six available areas of land and these are used to produce the resources to be sold, to construct buildings that bestow certain abilities on their owners, and eventually to construct the six required components of the palace required for victory. The main strategic decisions result from coping with the dilemma of which buildings are going to be the most useful and when to build them at the expense of being able to produce resources. As the game progresses it becomes more difficult as the palace takes up more and more of your limited available space. There's nothing intrinsically wrong with 'Fürstenfeld' as a game, and all the mechanisms driving it are solid, it's just that if you've played your fair share of Euros you won't see anything new here at all. It doesn't aim above anything other than mediocrity and really I'd prefer to see a game attempt originality and get it wrong rather than something that at its core feels exactly the same as countless other games that have come before it. It's fiddly to play too as you keep moving the resources on and off the breweries' supply and demand scale.

I'm always up for playing new games from Friese. I don't expect him to ever top Power Grid, and his past games have been hit and mis for me.
The rules for this one are very straightforward. It plays quickly and doesn't take too long while still offering a bit of depth. I'm not sure how much depth and replayability though. It appears to offer multiple strategies, but I'm not sure it actually does. I had the impression, after our first play that the only way to go might be to cycle through your deck as fast as possible. The player who did this fastest, won in our game, the player who did this slowest, came dead last.
I had a good time though and am willing to play this again, though I don't expect to add this to my collection.

I was surprised with this game. I was not expecting much from it, but it was a lot of fun. I only played with 2 players, but it seems like it would scale without problem, I would imagine it would only get better with more players.

It's not quite a 7, it is fun and I enjoyed playing it however, I don't see myself going for it too often. Though, if someone suggested it, I would gladly pull it out and play!

I really liked the different mechanics in this game specifically the deck management side of it, but the strategy of just amassing wealth and sitting back on your money for a late game flurry of buying was too easy and cheapened the game some what. Perhaps with more plays this will open up a little more or that strategy can be countered.

Update - During a 4 player game no further strategies presented themselves and the brewery demands were essentially pointless. I like player interaction in my games and this has next to none.

Furstenfeld is a fun game with fairly thin theme, but a good amount of depth. Having to build palace pieces over your production spaces can make for some tough decisions, especially in the advanced game.

Better/more fun IMO than Factory Manager by the same designer, but still quite a bit too much randomness involving the card sequence of your deck, which can't be changed.  This has a bit of deckbuilding added to your personal player board development.

A nice kind of deck building game. I didn't like the almost solitaire aspect of the game. The available markets are enough even for the last player in turn order (yes the last player is penalized but I don't think there is enough penalty). Nice and new idea on deck building!

After a first play it seemed somewhat fine, but giving it a second try revealed a game of constant annoying game piece rearrangements and not much versatility. Although I do like the artwork of this game.

Anno 1516:
As a young sovereign you are cultivating your small Fürstenfeld to supply goods to the local breweries. But you still miss your greatest dream: your personal palace. Your status will finally rise high enough to leave the vexed farming behind and to demand taxes from the surrounding rural population, so you can finally live in peace.

Plays smoothly; great components apart from the 'goods' which i wanted to be bigger (my big, fat fingers!)

Not sure I 'get it' - but interesting none the less.

It's a decent game, but the markets didn't seem as interesting as they should have - prices stayed pretty high after the early game. I also worry about replayability - it's not clear to me that there are enough different things to do.

The market mechanism plays a minor role in this game: Gameplay is mostly about hand (deck?) management and deciding when to put down your palace cards. It almost could have been a cardgame. The game plays fast and is easy to explain, which are big pluses in my book. Too bad they decided to use such drab colors for such nice artwork. Quality wise, components could have been better overall. Still, I wouldn't mind playing this again!

I love that Friese built a game around  the only mechanic of Power Grid that I enjoyed: upgrading resource plants. I love how the market works: you have to make sure that if you trash the price of a resource in a brewery by selling a ton of that resource, you have to make sure that there will be another brewery that you can sell our goods to next turn for maximum profit. The fact that the market fluctuates based on demand is an aspect that I enjoy from Navegador, but I prefer it in this game. I love the "deck unbuilding" aspect as well, as can be beneficial to build small buildings, then build over them, just to thin your deck. My favorite part of the game is the transition from an economic engine to playing all of your palaces. You have to store sufficient money so that you can build the last palace even once you have depleted your production engine. These are my thoughts after one play, but I absolutely love this game and find it to be totally underrated. I haven't even tried the advanced version yet, which I will probably love even more.

Economic, deck building, harvest game, where you use your deck to build your personal area, which gives you greater crop yields, or special abilities like drawing more cards, larger hand sizes, extra income, etc.

I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Again, it's got the "building a personal area" aspect I enjoy, and it was tough deciding on what to build and where. It's not point based, so each piece you build towards winning the game is "dead", IE that space is no longer productive for resources or abilities. So, you have to build them to win, but build too early and you bog down, too late and you lose.

An economic Friedmann Friesse game that Sharon will play! Hurrah! Gets points purely for that. Will have to play semi-expert game with Sharon (still random start but with the 2 extra cards). But also want to try the expert mode and with more players.

This another of Friedemann Friese's game design deconstructions/experiments, where he takes an oft used mechanic and turns it on its head, just to see if he can. This time it's deck building, with the twist being you start with a full deck and race to take it apart.

At first I wasn't too impressed. Like Power Grid, the goods market is a bit fiddly and worse, it doesn't seem to inspire much in the way of clever plays to deny your opponents. Occasionally it can be done, but it's rarely a game winning move. It wasn't until half way through the game, that I finally found the interesting bits. The balancing act between building your useless castle pieces and maintaining your farm's profitability is a wonderful puzzle. (Assuming you are playing by the "advanced" rules, which require each castle piece to be built in a specific areas.) 

It's also very much a race, as the first one to complete all six castles wins. This creates some fun moments when two or three players are desperately searching through their deck for the final piece, or even better when the other players keep pushing up the cost of that last piece so that it sits just out of reach, turn after turn.

The decks are pretty simple, so my guess is that it will flame out fairly quickly, once everyone unlocks the strategies...but at least for the moment, it's a pretty interesting design.

Gioco assolutamente sottovalutato, poche regole e chiare e svariate strategie da seguire, l'ordine delle carte conta e potrebbe influire sulla partita ma almeno rende le partite stesse sempre differenti.Bello.

One play only, but something is totally wrong with this game, you need a lot of home rules, maybe even a new redesign of the game.

Sólo una partida, pero algo está del todo mal en este juego, necesitas reglas caseras, incluso puede que un nuevo rediseño del juego.

Market is not working properly. In the first half of the game you don't have anought resources to try to manipulate it so prices will grow slowly. In the second half when you've got more resources to sell - if you try to lower prices on one market they will eventually rise a lot faster on the other. Because of that you always can sell your good for decent prices. And because of that you just draw some cards, build some building without any deep strategy. So the deck bulding / card drafting mechanism is not that interesting as it seamed at the beginning

Big dissapointment.

You want to play a game with interesting and WORKING market system? Play Planet Steam.

I was disappointed at how thoroughly pasted-on the beer theme is, but that's partly because I let myself get too excited about a game where you use barley, hops and spring water to make beer.

The reverse-Dominion label makes sense in a lot of ways, but Furstenfeld lacks Dominion's infinite replayability and doesn't quite measure up in sheer elegance.  

Still, not a bad game at all, and it's definitely high-yield considering it's low time investment.

I love the theme and gameplay is fun, but sometimes you feel really boned by the order of cards in your deck and there's little way to help that.

After 1 Play: There is way too much fiddling with the market for how little the prices actually change.  There are no strategic options, and the tactical decisions are often obvious.  After a while the players are just cycling their deck, waiting for their last palace or two.

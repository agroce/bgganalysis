I can't say this is my favorite party game, but it's probably my favorite party "trivia" game. It plays quickly, can scale up from 3-10+ players when you are playing in teams, and it's been a big hit recently with our (mostly non-gamer) extended families.

Really fun party trivia game where the most knowledgeable person doesn't always win. Everyone submits their answer to a question (which is always numerical). The answers are put in order, and everyone can bet on the one they believe is correct. The answer that is closest without going over (Price is Right style) is the one that pays out. I can teach this in three minutes and have yet to have someone dislike it.

A superb reimagining of the Wits & Wagers game we all know and love.  The questions span a variety of topics that will interest adults and kids alike.  I do find it slightly disappointing when we come upon questions where players will know the the answers.  This seems to take away a little of the fun because there is no mystery about who will score points and who might know the answer.  Still, it seems that these questions aren't as frequent as they appeared initially.  My only other complaint is that they only include equipment for up to 5 players/teams.  It would be nice if it was open to larger groups without having to team up.

But here's why this game is so great...the new scoring mechanism.  It's so simple, because players simply place meeples on the answers they think are correct and if they are right they score points.  This takes away the counting out of chips that will frustrate some in the original game, and makes the scoring so much easier to understand for young players.  I enjoy this scoring system so much that we have virtually stopped playing the original game in favor of this one.  Northstar games has hit another home run in my opinion, and this one is for the whole family (anyone who's old enough to read.)

In some ways (scoring system, questions etc) this is better than it's larger cousin.

Many many questions and extremely US centric - so for players/owners elsewhere in the world (especially for teachers using this game in class) - it's in many cases easier to make up your own questions.

Having said that - the mechanisms that drive the game are solid and highly enjoyable.

Very happy to have a W&W version that works well with the kids, though it didn't feel quite as compelling as the original.  This may simply be because it's the second time around for us with this concept and not so much a fault of the game.  Scoring is simplified (hooray!) and questions are interesting.  Quite a few questions related to subjects my 3rd grader had been studying in school, so he was happy to feel very competetive in that sense.  My 5 y.o. daughter also loves and requests this game even though it's pretty difficult for her to do much more than guess at answers (even at that, though, she can still be competetive!).  We made it through approx. 10 questions per game so given 150 cards with 2 questions per card, I estimate we'll be through all the questions in 30 games.  Expansions will be needed!  Oh -- We love the meeple colors (that include pink and purple!).

Note:  Errata on card #139 which asks how many states seceded from the Union during the U.S. Civil War.  The correct numerical answer (I won't list so as not to give a spoiler) is given, but Florida is listed twice while Virginia has been left off.

It says family, but in reality parents will still do better than kids. Probably better to call it W&W Kids.

This is still a very good party game. The game doesn't stall if no one knows the correct answer and the betting mechanism can lead to lots of interesting table talk and interaction. The game doesn't take more than 45 minutes in my experience. The whiteboards are plenty big so players can have fun drawing pictures to go along with their answers.

Solid family gaming filler. The supplied set of questions are USA based, but that's not a huge issue since the questions tend to be such that which no one will know the actual answer anyway. The game manages to be fast paced and not outstay its welcome. I've only ever played this game in sets of 2 because it's so quick and fun. The game is easy for new players to pick up, which is great. 

I'll probably have got through the first half of the questions around the end of my next (10th) play to put it in context, which is still better than some trivia games. My worry is there's no refill pack of questions, so I'm not sure how much play this will get after that point or how well the game will work with half remembered answers.

The game's had 2 beer spillages and survived in surprisingly good condition. The colours and sizes of meeples can be easily told apart and the pens work nicely. I used baby wipes on the boards between turns, which needed drying after because hand wiping the pen off doesn't work very well. The board insert is great and the game packs away into it very well.

RATING: 8
Family version of the much awarded trivia game, and turns trivia into fun for the whole family.  The scoring system is brilliant, because you get points for guessing the right answer, even if it's someone else's answer!  Very fun and enjoyable for adults and kids (and the playing-field is somewhat leveled by the scoring mechanism), and playable in under half an hour. The betting mechanism of the original game has been simplified, and family friendly meeples have been incorporated.
Negatives: One draw-back is the limited number of questions (150 cards with two questions each), and the fact that many questions have a limited audience (many questions about popular culture, and specific to American culture).  Most people will get 15-20 games out of the questions, and be looking for new ones.  Can use questions from the original Wits & Wagers game with the family edition.

A game that anyone can play. Great gateway, and plays very fast for a trivia game. The difficulty level of the questions is spot on for casual gamers / non-trivia geeks.

My family loves this game.  The kids love that they win 50% of the times against the adults.  My husband & I love that it's fun.  Most games they love are hard for us to play often, not this game.  My youngest is frequently the winner, and at 8 she's had to get used to usually losing.  What a refreshing experience for her.

With 300 questions total & how frequently our family plays I'm hoping there is an expansion packet of cards in the future.
 
I took the game to a birthday party at my sister's house & all there loved playing (7 years old to my 96 year old Grandmom)
  
North Star games guarantees the parts of the game for a full year so I'm not worried about the pens drying out especially since they doodle all over the boards!

Excellent game for the whole family.

I actually appreciate the simplified scoring.  People can understand it more.

The questions are indeed too simple for adults.  I'll save them for when I'm actually playing with kids.

But I do use the rules and components and just play with regular W&W questions.  You might have to make the "1" a "Zero" to work for all questions though.

It's a trivia game, but unlike Trivial Pursuit, it isn't frustrating. You guess a number and then everyone wagers for points based on who got the closest without going over the correct number. Great for the whole family, and even though some people will automatically know answers, there isn't a massive bonus for that because other people who know you will wager everything on your answer for points of their own.

A Christmas present from me to the kids, and they didn't even ask for it....but now, it is "hey, can we play Wits and Wagers?".  So, it was a good choice indeed.  My youngest is 10 and can be competitive, course I got the Hannah Montana and Taylor Swift questions right, but she got the jet airplane one right, so, you never know.

I'm not a social gamer, and I don't enjoy 99% of party games because of it, but this is probably the best trivia game in existence since it mitigates the uncontested-skill(memorization of mostly useless facts) aspect of all the other standard trivia games. Adding a gambling mechanism may heighten the drama for some, but I don't enjoy betting/wagering games much either.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (July 2017)

I kind of like Wits & Wagers. Back in the day (2010 :D) I was very excited to play it but I have never enjoyed it very much. Still, I think the premise is great so I still have the game among my collection. I had some curiosity about the differences of the family edition and after playing it, I can say this game is not for me. 

The rules are pretty simple. You can explain them under 2 minutes. Playtime is around 30 minutes or less.

The idea of the game is to win points by correctly answering very tough questions or by being the player who was closest to the real answer. The novel idea for the whole series is that if you don’t know the answer (very likely) you can still win by betting on the answer of other players. 

As with its big brother, I have fun when I play the game, but my desire to play it again is rather low. The questions remain as hard as ever, at least for me. I would have thought the questions were easier in this edition. Some of the questions are in miles and inches and it is hard for us to think out of the metric system, but it is a minor issue for us.

The scoring system radically change. Before, you had some poker chips to bet on the answers, I really liked this part of the game (my favorite part). In the family edition scoring is simplified. You have two meeples to use on the answer or answers you think are right. The effect of this is that the scores are way too close at the end of the game so you feel the game is decided by blind luck. I get that this system levels the field when you play with kids, so I guess it is perfect for the family edition.

Bottom line, Wits & Wagers Family is an ok party game, but my desire to play it again is low. I prefer the original edition of the game so I will sell this one ASAP. Still, I recognize it is a fun game to introduce to new players and/or families, but the original game was as well. I, somewhat, dislike the new score system.

A version of the original game with simplified scoring.  

I think that the old betting board is going to be retired in favour of the meeples from this game, which I think is a better scoring system.

The questions in this game are definitely easier than in the basic game, which makes this infinitely more playable.  An easy 8.

A great simplification of Wits & Wagers.  Though I'm not a fan of some of the kid-based pop culture questions, I liked the simplified scoring system more than the original, which I always thought was too complicated and too swingy, where one good bet could win you the game.  Our kids are still a little too young to understand percentages and stuff, but I can't wait to play this with them more.

RATING: 8
Excellent gameplay.  Cards are a mixed bag; way too many questions that inevitably won't age well, like "how many albums had [insert random pop star here] released by 2010" or "how many episodes of [insert random Disney channel show here] were there by 2010?"  There are enough "good" cards that it's easy enough to just discard "bad" questions and get a new one.  Kids love the game.

We played this with 3 adults.  Compared to Wits and Wagers it is LAME.  However to be fair this is more meant for a family with small kids.  That being said, I will give it another try.  The full version would be boring for adults.  Many questions were very easy for us and it was not a challenge.  How many teaspoons in a Tablespoon etc.

I really enjoy Wits & Wagers as a trivia game that's fun and actually revels in the fact that people almost never know the right answer.  This version simplifies the scoring a bit which does accomplish the goal of people more family friendly.  However, if you enjoy the "betting" aspect of the original, it's probably best just to stick with that one.

I like the ease of the new scoring system, and my kids like these questions better than the original game.

Each game uses 5-8 questions so in all about 35-50 games worth.  All said, very enjoyable like the original and plays quicker. Great family fun!

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]6[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]We ended up playing this a bunch during the holidays with our families, but once we acquired Auf Teufel komm raus! and Winner's Circle we stopped playing Wits and Wagers. The addition of those new games also coincided with us cycling through all the cards for Wits and Wagers and feeling like we played the game out. That said, I'd definitely recommend the game for families since the questions are perfect all ages and this is by far the best trivia game I've played. My family happens to enjoy games that are more raucous with the aforementioned Auf Teufel being everyone's new favorite.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]A huge hit with both sets of parents, this one will definitely come out during the holidays. By far the best trivia game I've played and as the title says definitely works well with younger kids and non gamers. The betting is simple and all the questions have numbers for answers so you don't need to be Cliff Claven (Cheers reference for the younger folk) to enjoy this game![/i]

The mechanic is still fun, with the scoring made easier than the original. But the questions, oh the questions, they're so American popular culture specific. When pulling it out with my family, I'm bypassing 4 cards loaded with what American teenagers do or know, looking to find nice generic worldly questions that my kids at least have a shot at. For Aussies, I cannot commend this as a family purchase at all as a result. I'll be lucky to get 5 games out of the cards that come with the game, given so many questions are unsuitable.

Big hit. Gave copy away to a family who we played with in April, 2013. Looking for Party version next (like the chips better than the meeples). Oct 2013: lowered to 9 after playing the App quite a bit. Dec, 2013: spouse picked up copy on sale at Target, $14.99.

Oct 2014: I have made up my own theme questions a few times, and played this with mixed groups. It has always been a smash hit. When company comes over, this is always my go-to-title if it includes non-gamers. Always a hoot. Raised to a "10", as in these situations it has never missed.

The Family version is much better than the original version.  Instead of getting odds and betting with chips, each player gets a large meeple and a small meeple.  The correct answer gets one point, the small meeple gets one point (if placed on the correct answer) and the big one gets two points.  The score is recorded on a dry erase board.  This is much better than figuring the payouts and the odds.  If playing the full width of the scoreboard is too long, you can play to a lesser number or play for a set number of rounds.  (My rating is based on comparison to other party games, not all games.)

My family and friends love this, as do I. The trivia that is in this is good and varied. The best part is the wagering...when I think my answer is good, and then someone puts something down that makes me question my answer. Then I choose theirs and I get no points...Love it.

A great addition to the Wits & Wagers games. Balanced well for family situations. The questions are a bit lighter and there is no direct betting, but more scoring points.

While I do like it, it does take a bit of the betting aspect of the game. A great game for family nights or get togethers.
 
This game went over very well with non games.

I have raised my rating to an 8 after more plays. This is due to the fact that I have used to this to have non-gamers as well as people who don't like games to play.

Awesome family game for kids (just need to be able to write their numbers).  My 5 yr old son beat us his first game (he trusted my own answers more than I did!) After just 4 back-to-back games, we're already wanting more cards because we know we'll play it so much. I only rate it as low as an 8 because some of the questions are too easy, even for kids - you don't need easy questions to make it fun for kids, just topics that kids can relate to.

A solid trivia game, the bidding system works well in a family setting because everyone has a chance to score points, even if they don't know the answer.  And with numerical answers like a specific percentage, it's likely NO ONE at the table knows the exact answer.  That's kinda the point.   

I currently prefer this version to the original Wits & Wagers as I prefer the more streamlined betting.  However, the questions are much easier, some of them game-breakingly easy, such as when everyone's answers will be below 10 (for example, How many Weasly children are there?), or touch on things that should pretty much be common knowledge for adults (How many cups in a gallon?)

If I ever acquire Wits & Wagers and/or Wits & Wagers Party, I'll just combine all the question sets in one box.  Until then, this one still does its job as a party game for the whole family.  Break it out after Thanksgiving, while everyone's still sitting around the table enjoying pie, that's what worked for me :)

This version reduces the number of players from 7 to 5, doesn't quite "remove the gambling element" but does simplify the wagering.  Questions seem 1) either too easy or too hard for children; 2) more vague than the standard W&W game.  On the bright side, this is the first Northstar game in my collection where ALL the dry-erase markers work!

For example, "How many Disney Princesses are there (November 2009)?" Does this mean strictly the "Disney Princess" franchise, or any princess mentioned in a Disney cartoon or film? What about Disney Channel shows?  Does it include the 2009 Princess and the Frog?  Apparently: yes, no, no, no.  Other questions led to similar discussions.  

I recommend one person doesn't play but simply reads all the questions and when discussions like the above come up, they can look at the answer and rule on what was probably meant by the question.

Other questions are too easy: "How many feet in a mile?" We had 4 correct answers and one incorrect, everyone bet on the correct answers, scoring 4,4,4,4,3 points.  Not a fun round (especially for the one who got it wrong).

Again, a non-playing referee could skip such "gimmees", but it'll make the limited number of questions run out that much sooner.

I hope an expansion comes soon with more (and better!) questions and support for more players.

I actually prefer this scoring system to the regular edition.  In the original, it just seemed like people would hold onto their money until the 6th round, and then if they were clearly behind, blow it all and then who knows.  The only negative with this game is that it is limited to five guessers, and that there aren't hardly enough questions.

I really enjoy this game, which I 'sell' to people as a trivia game where you don't need to know any answers. The concept is great, game explaination time minimal, and people understand how it all works after 1 turn. My frequent lack of knowledge of the answers, inability to guess/estimate close to the answer and constant failure to pick the scoring answers should serve as a warning to those who wish to team up with me :p

This game is a good contrast to traditional Euro games that I also enjoy.

This is mostly the same game as standard Wits and Wagers except instead of the betting and odds method of scoring you simply have a large meeple (worth 2 points) and small meeple (worth 1 point) that you place on the answers to score similar to Say Anything.

First of all, why does this game need to exist?  The bidding and odds mechanic of Wits and Wagers is one of the most interesting parts and what made it so fantastic compared to SO MANY other standard trivia games.  I get that they may not want young members of a family to gamble but come on, it's a friendly party game with plastic chips that represent imaginary points.

I will always prefer the standard version of Wits and Wagers, family and young children or no.

W&W Family is our favorite trivia game by far. Simple bidding and scoring mechanics with questions, and the bidding, that help balance out the smarts across the players...usually.

Problematic playing in Australia because of the US-centric questions. On the other hand, that meant it less likely that any of us knew the answers -- just educated guesses. Good fun.

Very average. Some questions are just silly and obvious (how many mph does the car from Back to the Future need to go to travel backwards in time) and the whole streamlined betting doesn't make it as interesting. Not bad, but not great either.

Questions with numeric answers, everyone guesses, place large and small bet on any players guesses. closest without going over scores points. As far as trivia games go this one is pretty good.It also gets rid of the timing issues ( I said it first), the "close enough to be right" issues, and the person who knows lots of random trivia always wins issues that come up with a lot of other games like this.

A very enjoyable game for the family.  A full game only lasts about 15-20 minutes, so you can play it multiple times in a sitting, which gives all the kids a chance to win.

The hit Wits and Wagers party game makes a fantastic leap into family game night with Wits and Wagers Family. Perfect play mechanics for a family setting. Great questions that kids love to try to answer. You can see our [thread=516101]full family video review of Wits and Wagers family here[/thread].

I enjoy this variation on the standard trivia game. It doesn't matter so much whether you know the correct answer as whether or not you can guess who's answer might be the closest to correct.  The family edition makes it accessible to the kids as well.

Simplified version of the original without the betting!  Questions are a lot more common knowledge and you feel more in the range even if you don't know the answer.

Worked out great as our ice-breaker type game during the summer Hot U program at my church.  This was for both boys and girls in grades 3-5.

Improves, IMHO on the standard version for a more casual meeting involving kids and  nongamers.  BUT, will still prefer the full version in a party setting with other gamers included.

I am awful at trivia, my brain doesn't retain anything.  I still enjoy regular Wits & Wagers because I find the betting aspect fun but this Family version kind of strips out the enjoyment of that aspect of the game.  There's no risk of losing anything, no reason not to throw out bids so it takes away all the tension.

*Owned for school - classroom set* My students call this one "Meeple Trivia" and have really enjoyed playing so far this year.  Sometimes they get so excited to read their answers they forget to place their meeples to bet.  :)

RATING: 6
Solid game, a bit short on cards (why not a few more questions per card?  WTF is up with the tiny cards?).  Kids have really enjoyed it.

Have found a few questions that are just too obvious, which makes the betting weird.  But it's not a huge deal.

I bought this game while hanging out at a friends house.  We were trying to think of something to do and we decided to go out a buy a board game.  My friends' spouse kind of dislikes games, so we chose this game in hopes that should could enjoy it at least a little (I don't think she did.)

This game is very streamlined.  There is no gambling or odds pay outs like in the original game.  It is quick and is certainly a "family" game.  I didn't dislike it, and I could see it coming out in situations with older children involved.

This really works for families with younger kids and non-gamers. It plays quicker than either regular Wits and Wagers or Say Anything, so the game moves along at a brisk pace and multiple games are likely. Without the odds involved easier for kids/non-gamers.

Only draw back is that some questions have widely known answers, so the defeats purpose of the task. For example, what is the temperature that water boils. We just discard such questions.

I don't like it quite as much as standards Wits and Wagers due to the lack of betting, but it's still very fun. This version is much better suited to families or casual gamers, as the name would suggest.

This was on sale at B&N for half price... I probably should have bought every one they had for future birthday/Christmas presents :laugh:

I really like the simpler scoring in this version of the game as it makes it more of a quick race instead of a betting explosion.  This will certainly be in the extended family/party game rotation on a regular basis!

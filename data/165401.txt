GAME: Wir sind das Volk!
RANK: 535
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Note: All of my plays are prior to the v2.0 rules. 

I think the comparison to Twilight Struggle is apt in many ways; it's a 2p, Cold War, area influence, card driven game. It's very tense in places (as is TS), but ultimately it's less tension filled than Twilight Struggle (IMHO). This isn't bad, to the contrary, WsdV offers numerous pathways to victory and it's sort of (seriously) obtuse at times, especially with the end of decade calculations and planning for those effects.

What I particularly like about it is that there is a different feel to having a shared "hand" of cards. Now jockeying for what cards to protect and what cards to scratch takes on a different feel compared to working around your opponents events and takes a backseat to the normal hand management functions that occur in TS.

My initial ding is actually rather small and sort of personal; this is what I would imagine Twilight Struggle would have acted like had it been designed as a asymmetrical Euro game. Sure, there are thematic elements, but ultimately, I felt it sort of pasted on where as during TS, I have little difficulty immersing myself as a super power who is playing events and watching things unfold. in WsdV, I find it closest to that of a government stats job than running a country per se. Other than occasional art, I rarely differentiate any of the cards; I know that "there is a 4 unrest card in decade 3 I need to keep an eye out for" but the historical event it represents isn't there mentally.

It's different enough from TS mechanically, and what theme there is (which I'm probably overly harsh on as I'm not nearly as familiar with all of the cards and events of German history) is both attractive and does suffice, so I don't see it as eclipsing (or falling short of) Twilight Struggle/1989, but augmenting it as another way of describing a Cold War situation with different mechanics. Overall, very enjoyable so far.

Great fun & some serious strategy too.  Took a couple of plays to get all the rules.  3 wins for East in my 3 games (1 solo), so first impression is that West has the most to do.

Consider this as a simplified with lesser extent than Twilight Struggle kind of game. Or a smaller controlled field of gaming thus making this game more cutthroat. 
The rules booklet is not very helpful.

Mr. Richard Sivél has done it again! Along with Mr. Peer Sylvester they gave as an excellent game of the Cold War era! I love playing Twilight Struggle and this is an awesome game that doesn't copy anything from TS and it manages to give its own flavour to the "wargame" species. It plays very quickly (for what it is of course) and has so many interesting choices. Highly recommended!

My favorite 2p CDG. Much better than Twilight Struggle. There's very little luck and almost no hidden information. Theme and mechanics work wonderfully together, easy to teach and plays quickly yet full of depth and interesting decisions. Unfortunately, after several plays I'm finding it less replayable.

RATING: 8
Wir Sind does a great job of representing in a very playable manner a fascinating period of German history between partition at the end of World War II and the fall of the Berlin Wall.  The struggle is between the West German economic powerhouse and a socialist system that by game end will be under huge pressure.   

The East German will be in for a rough ride, but it isn't as though he is the powerless victim of historical inevitability.  Indeed, many of the more interesting strategic decisions are his. The choices of both players have a profound impact on how the game develops and on the relative values of the cards.  

Wir Sind's take on CDG mechanics is fresh and interesting.  Just as in Twilight Struggle, the deck is divided into historical periods.  However, Wir Sind gives us a shared tableau of cards to choose from, removing most of the luck of the deal (there is a small deal) and creating all sorts of angst over what to choose and when.

Those cards that deal out benefits or pain - and sometimes both - render Wir Sind highly interactive in ways you wouldn't expect a game that looks like solitaire Power Grid to be.  Splendid.  

Wir Sind isn't perfect.  The multi-step end of decade phase reminds me somewhat of La Citta, where it is too difficult to calculate how things will pan out, so you go with your gut and hope for the best through some significant changes to the board position.  I found Thierry Aradan's player aid really helpful in making this phase and other aspects of the game less opaque.   

Wir Sind's distinctive artwork isn't beautiful, but I have warmed to it.  Production quality is good.  The rules are decent, but do download a player aid.

3/3/17: Rating may go up with further plays if we figure out how to play this in 90-120 minutes.  It has a lot of chrome and a lot of steps to walk through.  You play 4 rounds, one for each decade, and then at the end of the decade there's a 10-step end of round process that you walk through which is extremely mechanical.  I can't help but feeling that this could have been streamlined a bit.

The player interaction is somewhat indirect, and you mostly affect the player during the end of decade process.

I'm not a big fan of the rulebook.  I appreciate the fact that it has good examples, but it is a little too concise for me.  I'd appreciate a little more overview at the beginning and more wordiness. This is one of those games where you need to figure things out by playing the game, I really couldn't get a feel for the game by reading the rulebook.

Wir sind das Volk is strategic and tactically rich, but approachable enough that it can be taught pretty easily to new players. However, it'll take a few games for a new player to understand the strategy of the East/West--with the West being a bit more opaque than the East. further, the West is given a few less tools than the East to implements its strategies, so is less interesting to play. Still, the game provides interesting aspects of economy management and conflict management, and the game state is molded and developed with a historical bend (e.g., population flight from East to West, which is prevented by the Wall).  Even after you've learned each faction, there's lots of fun to be had as each player choice helps develop the tactical landscape of the game. This is a very good conflict-based euro games, and is vastly superior to Twilight Struggle. I just wish the West was as interesting to play as the East (and the more I play it, the more pronounced my issue with it becomes).

Also, at least for me, the experience of this game leans more towards the Twilight Struggle CDG experience where much of the narrative generated by the cards fades in favor of the competition between the players. This is in contrast to, say, Washington's War where the events form a strong narrative to the game. That said, there is still some narrative in Wir Sind Das Volk!, and they predominately show up via the tracks and whether the East takes a special card.

Wir sind das Volk!: 2+2 (2017)

RATING: 9
Really enjoy this card driven game that is kind of a war game but also a economic/ socio-political simulation of East-West German tensions post WW2.  Like how quick it plays, like the level of simulation.  Downsides - a tiny bit fiddly and finding people who want to play it  as its a game you really need to play multiple times to get a feel for.  Also would like more text on the cards but there is more info available on the cards in historical notes so understand why they went for the multilingual option.  Update - excellent implimentation at boardgamecore and really enjoying exploring it on there.  I think the system would work great in other settings too so want designers to do more.  The only downsides with the game are also its strength - it is modelling a historical period so whilst there is some flexibility e.g. do you build the Berlin wall or not? there is not as much as in a game which isnt routed in reality, secondly the game is full of non- obvious choices routed around how the end of decade effects impact on the choices that you made and events that happened during the decade.

It's an economy development game that leads to consequences at the end decade resolution, some of them can favor you others not.

This game is more euro and less luck driven than Twilight Struggle. Add half timeplay and now try to push me to play TS again.

Amazing game for two players. Instabuy after playing my first game with a friend's copy.

*update*

After 3 games, I only can remark how good this game is. Like my gaming friend say it's more comparable to a kind of 2 players Volko's COIN than to Twilight Struggle.

Rating unchanged mostly because it was a 9 after first game already. The initial blast remains.

RATING: 8
IMO a good introduction to card-driven games, certainly much less state to juggle in your head compared to Labyrinth, COINs or TS. Some rules are a bit fiddly and easy to get wrong (like: who dismantles what when), but as long as you do it consistently, a casual player probably won't notice much difference.

Though we need to play much more, as it currently feels West is easier to play as. The only game won by East happened because both countries collapsed, and East owns the tiebreak for that.

RATING: 7.5
Juego de temática un poco extraña: las tensiones entre las dos alemanias durante las cuatro decadas siguientes al final de la II guerra mundial. El juego se juega en cuatro rondas, una por década, en las que se juegan dos rondas de 7 cartas. Cada jugador va escogiendo alternativamente la carta que quiere jugar. LAs cartas se pueden jugar de varias maneras, como puntos de producción, para aumentar la industrialización, como puntos para elevar el nivel de vida, o como eventos, para alterar diversos marcadores.
Al final de cada ronda se evalúan una serie de parámetros y se continua con la siguiente. 

Gana alemania occidental si consigue que al final de una evaluación, alemania oriental tenga cuatro revueltas, o si consigue que desaprezca el socialismo por completo. Gana alemania oriental si aguanta las cuatro décadas, o si consigue meter en el juego a todos los socialistas.

Algunas personas lo comparan con el TS, y aunque no tiene ninguna mecánica común, confieso que entiendo la comparación, por la sensación que te deja el juego.

Es dificil de asimilar y de ver estratégicamente el juego, pero una vez que te metes, es un juego muy interesante. Desde luego, es no apto para no jugones. No entenderían la esencia. 

Fue un buen descubrimiento gracias a tostador.

Preliminary rating. Played a second consecutive game after the first one, and the following day I kept thinking about what I did wrong and what I would do differently in the next game. All excellent signs of a good game!

My only fear is that the game could become repetitive due to the small number of cards, but our first two games played very differently, so I remain optimistic.

Really artful take on the history of Cold War Germany. East Germany needs to stay alive into the 90s, while West Germany needs to grow their economy and push East Germany over the brink. The West German position is fairly straightforward; they largely fight unrest by growing their economy. The East Germans, though, are in an interesting spot. They have a lot of choices about how to keep their state going, but none of them are easy. They can go the historical heavy police state route, building the Berlin wall; they can decide to actually try out Communism; or they can build out their economy. All come with pitfalls; the police state encourages flight and is expensive, communism doesn't create prestige or economic growth, and growing the economy requires foreign exchange which its hard to support. In practice, it'll usually be finding a good mix of the three, as the West German player has significant influence through card play over what's going to be available and going to work.

If there is a flaw to be found in the game, it's that the East German position is actually significantly better developed than the West. The West's choices for their own development are fairly limited - even economic growth that produces consumer goods. They have to avoid too much unrest because the only tool they have to deal with it is more economic growth, but unrest that leads to mass protests makes growth hard, so that can be a real problem. The East on the other hand has lots of strategic choices in approaching the game. However, this is all mitigated by the fact that the West is still making strategic choices about how to run down the East - denying them currency, demoralizing the socialist party, etc. The game is very interactive and players choices make a huge impact on how it develops.

This is one of my favorite games of 2015 - one of those rare gems that puts an artful game with a strong narrative arc into a well-developed setting, combining great gameplay with great topical engagement. *So* much better than Twilight Struggle.

RATING: 3
Ooof.  :soblue:

Given the number of reliable, smart people who rate this game very highly, I'm going to have to assume that I flubbed some fundamental rule in learning and teaching this game.  

If not, this is a pointless mess, full of clunky rules and seemingly interminable cube shifting.  There are components we never used, corner-cases we never fully understood, and a lengthy maintenance phase which is the only time you actually see the impact of all your previous decisions (yes, yes, good players will be making their decisions mindful of the maintenance phase consequences).

Even assuming that we did lots of things wrong, I didn't see anything redeeming here for me.  Usually, I'd be inclined to go back to the rulebook, watch video or two, and try again soon.  In this case, I just can't see how any of the elements we experienced end up making a game I want to play.  I mean, the board layout is sorta pleasing in its own way, I guess (not the illustrations, though).  I dunno, man.  I dunno.

Wow.

This is an economic war game if ever one existed.  However, the bloat common to most simulation games are realtively absent here, but there are still some tough rules to get through your head.

Although some malign the end-of-decade phase, I find it fascinating and thematic.  You never really know how much of an impact your actions have had on your opponent until you check for collapse at the end of the decade.  This can lead to some surprising results as you are on the early parts of the learning curve.  Although it becomes easier to see the butterfly effects of your action the more you play, it seems like it would be nearly impossible to model it all out in your head.

This would probably be my first 10 rated game, if my usual opponent felt the same as I do about this design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Update: Yep, this is a very good game, that makes a crappy first impression. After going through the first painful 3-4 games, everything falls into place and you start seeing the whole rather than the annoyances. And then the design starts showing its strength. You are always on the lookout to find the weak spot of your opponent and twist the knife to hurt him as much as possible until he concedes. Still:

- the rules should have been written with a view to ease learning the game
- there are a lot of rules exceptions that make the game harder and fiddlier
- the cards should have had event descriptions and more evocative art

The game has the potential to get an even higher rating with more plays. Keeper. 


---
This is a finely balanced system of a game. Having played only a few times, my first reaction is that this is not a game that thrills me or entices me to explore it further. The historical setting, the compactness and the somehow thematic representation of the various knobs feels good. There are several points though that do not seem yet to sit well with me:

- Most of the cards are drafted open, which results in a calculation exercise and loss of tension
- The historical events are just a headline on a card, a purely mechanical (albeit fitting for each) exercise
- The route building mechanism is dry as can be. At least in train games it is highly thematic
- The whole feel of the game is very abstract and unengaging, a ping-pong knob turning exercise
- The end of round scoring is not intuitive, not streamlined enough
- The dismantling vs. running down mechanism seems unnecessarily duplicating
- There are too many fiddly rule exceptions

I really want to give this game another chance, because I love the designers' previous games. Consider this a bad first impression, a preliminary rating.

After a few games which had to be broken off prematurely I was able to get in a full game at last. There were still a few errors which need to be corrected on subsequent attempts, but overall we got the gist of the game well enough. 

Although WsdV! is a game with a good thematic background and well-integrated mechanisms and patterns (DDR always verging on collapse, BRD building up infrastructure like there is no tomorrow, using different means to quell unrest), for the moment I fear that there really isn't that much difference in between games. To me winning by out-prestiging the East, or by forcing it to uphold a living standard it cannot pay for, aren't really majorly different wins. You're still spending a major part of game time building up infrastructure, or making it as resillient as possible against collapse. The rest are slight variations in how matters will be played out, plus a good deal of slowly growing more annoying icon management which has you weighing the benefits of a juicy infrastructure number against moving a marker a few spots in a direction which is beneficial to you; and that whole against another similar combination which is sure to be enacted by your opponent, thus undoing your move. And then WsdV! turns into a long, long game where not much really happens. The game's designer notes mention that initially East and West played too similarly, and the authors have certainly cracked that issue. It's just that now, from game to game, both East and West don't play all that differently. There is no way to have West use police state measures, or for East to invest heavily into infrastructure, in a weird [i]what if?[/i]-kinda way so to speak.

So sadly a lower rate than I would have liked to have given the game.

How - and where - your opponent pushes on you frames your game and your choices. A few of the mechanics involve hard-to-remember comparisons, but other than that, glorious 2p contest. Enjoyed much more than Twilight Struggle, in part because it felt like many fewer events had consequences in specific places (which always leads to "...if only I had memorized the deck" moments).

I particularly liked the both-sides events, where whomever selects it can omit one action - a really nice modification to the ops-points//action system.

This is a fantastic game.

Simple to learn, difficult and thrilling to play and master. A great deal of depth to the game and each of my first three games has been a fun and exciting experience. Appears extremely well-balanced and full of historic flavour. Components beautiful, great design in a remarkably small package, and there is a lot of excellent game here. 

Having a hard time winning as West. Played 7 games, and the East has won every single game (though one was close). This possible imbalance has been addressed in the updated rules, btw.

This is another Histogames gem. Highly recommended. Strong 8, that may even rise to a rare 9 after a few more plays.

Yes, it's gone up to a 9. Absolutely fantastic game, despite not being able to figure out any effective strategy as the West. Highly recommended. Kicks Twilight Struggle to the curb for me because of it's wonderful polish.

I think we got all the rules right, although it's really questionable since the Berlin situation is so fiddly and complicated. However, the game feels a little dry to me and I can't really get into the theme of it, despite it being a highly thematic game. The mechanics themselves aren't quite enough to make me excited to want to play this.
Might give it another try or two before deciding to trade/sell it.

This rating is based on a single play.  There are a lot of different things going on in this game.  End of age adjustments are very odd in how they affect the board.  The card play is very tit for tat like TS.  But the game, in general, is a lot more abstracted and difficult to tie in how they all the mechanisms work together.  Also, having knowledge of the deck composition is critical to winning.  For example, I found that if you don't do anything with socialists early, it will be impossible to hold up at the end of the game.  Most of the cards in the 4th age decrease socialists.  I'm not knocking the game due to the cards though...as that is common in card games. My main problem with the game is digesting the iconography and how the end of age checks play out. So the rating could rise if I ever get a chance to play it again.

This game seems to have an immense learning curve. Part way through the final turn I realised my chances of winning as the West were nil, as the game seems to be weighted towards the East.
I'm not sure I like that the East wins if the game runs out. Historically, I'm not sure that East Germany could survive after the collapse of the USSR (whether that would happen without East Germany falling is a separate question).
I wouldn't mind trying the game again, but I probably wouldn't demand another go.

A multi-tiered tug of war between Cold War Germany (East vs. West).   Driven by cards which focus on developing economy and infrastructure, the game feels like a hybrid design with a lot of teeth.   Not really a wargame at all, but very in-your-face with a lot of conflict and interaction.   The theme is heavily ingrained in the mechanisms, which makes it a thrill to play.   The end-of-decade sequence is a bit overwhelming at first, but makes sense after you play through it a few rounds.   Very unique and interesting game.   One of the strongest new designs I've seen in quite a while.   It pushes all the right buttons for me:  tightly integrated theme, competitive 2p mechanisms, unique visual presentation.

I'd say get this over 1989 - the twilight struggle sequel.

This is a more interesting and unique game that does a good job of describing the competition between free market and state run economics/political systems. Its a decent game that my rating perhaps under rates a little. Equally in the world of 2 player games there's more fund to be had.

yet another very good 2-player dripping with tons of theme ... very compact box, aids in transportation, and the perfectly sized board performs its job admirably ... this game reminds me so, of a badminton match .. one opponent (the West) serving forearm smashes, whilst the other (the East) volleys and defends for its' life ... this is a game of balance for the West .. living standards, high hopes have to be distributed evenly across the board, else, one shoots oneself in the foot ... and the East has to throw the wrench into any wonderful West plans ... very thought provoking, this is no stroll in the park, but needs a clear tactical leaning brain ... the tallying up process at each decade end is exceedingly difficult to master and needs several plays to hit any degree of comfort ... notwithstanding, would highly recommend this 2-player certainly

Wir Sind Das Volk is a very well balanced historical game with quite different strategies needed when playing East vs West Germany.  The rules were easier to pick up than I expected but it does take some plays to figure out the most viable strategies.  It takes a while for me anyway - 3 plays in and I'm yet to register a win.  Maybe next time!

Rating could go up or down. If I gave .5 ratings, this would be a 6.5, but that's a slippery slope. 

Somehow both deeply thematic and incredibly dry. Language independent in the worst way. Rules are opaque, and written in a way that does not help. More chrome than a Richard Berg game. Lots of interlocking parts, none of which are particularly interesting. The worst thing I can say about this game, I think, is that it's profoundly inessential. Yes, the theme's a little different, but the design fills the same niche as Twilight Struggle or (perhaps more accurately) 1989, and does so in a less exciting way. This game lacks drama. It may not even be fun, and I certainly don't think it's worth the work. Probably worth a second play, just to make sure.

Deutsch-Deutsche Geschichte als zumindest thematisch gelungenes Spiel. Diese historische Herangehensweise macht WSDV zu einem recht individuellen Autoren- und Liebhaberding: kein Euro von der Stange, sondern der Versuch, dem Thema auch spielideel gerecht zu werden. Während sich die Kartenzüge in der Auslage mit den historischen Ereignissen  aus vier Jahrzehnten flux und locker von der Hand spielen, merkt man in den vier Zwischenwertungen die hirnwindende Mühe, einen gerechten Ausgleich zwischen den Staatssystemen zu schaffen. Eine leichte Eckigkeit wird mit einer anderen Eckigkeit ausgeglichen. Dennoch bleibt unterm Strich der Mauerhöhe ein 2er-Kampf der Ideologien, indem mir spielerisch das Überleben der DDR mit seinen Mangelerscheinungen sogar besser zu gefallen vermag, als das auf Materialismus und imperialem Konsumdruck angelegte BRD. Das Spielbrett ist pure, ungeschminkte Erinnerung an grauen Geschichtsunterricht der 80er in Reinkultur.

RATING: 7.5
A 2-player historical weuro hybrid game about divided Germany 1945-1989 by the same guy who designed Maria and Friedrich. It is sort of a CDG, but not in the Mark Herman house style of CDG. I would put it part of the new wave of war games that eschew hex and counter or tons pieces in favor of abstracted political mechanics. Tons of theme and historical insights to be found in this game. Everything here is tight, tense, and immersive due to the historical events. Nothing feels scripted at all and big swings in fortune can be had based on which cards come out for a given decade. One of my favorite games from this year.

Opinion: with a theme that was not in my radar at the beginning I have found a gem, and then loved the theme. This is well integrated in the game, although the cards only have icons, the title and the point that you have lived it helps a lot.
The length of the game is just perfect, you have a brain burner game in less than 90 minutes with small size for your shelves.
How it works? well, just select one of the cards available and choose your options. As there are only 2 cards not showing each decade you can think that the replayability is low, could not be more wrong. With the cards you have several options (except applying the event if it is from the opposite), and each game is done on a different way with different solutions with the same cards

A political game of volleyball over the Iron Curtain. CDG and political struggle at its best. Unlike Twilight Struggle, it focuses quit a lot on the economy, which makes the game extremely asymmetrical, between the industrial powerhouse of the West and the powerful and flexible Communist control over the East.

Clean, smooth (despite its German bureaucratic rules), fast.

RATING: 7
After three games I finally turned around to rate this one. I usually rate after the first, therefore this one has to be special for me somehow. 

As for now I'm investing some time to play this as often as I can so I guess I like it a lot! 

This is an asymmetric game, complex in its interactions, that requires at least 3 or more plays to get a hang of. The rules have their set of wrinkles so a player's aid is recommended especially in the end of decade sequence. 

Up till now East Germany has always won. The Berlin Wall seems to be a very appealing choice, I can't see how the designer can claim that it was a "real choice", yes, of course you can decide NOT to build the wall, but it is the difference between making a very good move and making a merely good one. Wouldn't you go for the very good one each time?

Future plays will tell what the final verdict for this game is. I hope to come up with a strategy for West Germany to win. 

UPDATE
I was finally able to win with Western Germany, but I don't know what I did to achieve such a result. I think that a major role was played by the international prestige of Western Germany (I was able to bring it completely to the left and spill over a couple of times). The wall was erected and fell, but I think that maybe it would have been better if it had remained where it was: East Germany would have won the game. 

Hum... I'm interested in playing this further.

RATING: 8
A very solid game that juggles asymmetry and balanced two-player mechanics in an elegant way. The general setup and feel is obviously reminiscent of Twilight Struggle, but WSDV actually borrows much more from eurogames than from the GMT style of games - you're much more focused on building and optimizing your region's efficiency than on striking a terror balance with your opponent.

That said, the game can be quite confrontational at times, but it has more to with supporting unrest and infrastructural decay in your opponent's regions than with military/political threats. 

Despite its depth the game is fast-paced and easy to finish in under two hours, which is a HUGE plus for me. It's also not very pricey.

Fascinating so far. As the West, you're trying to keep your economy humming while putting out small fires--as the East, all you have are fires, and you are trying to stay alive.

RATING: 10
Wir sind das Volk! is a fantastic take on the Weuro-tug-of-war category for which Twilight Struggle might be the emblematic placeholder. In short, this game is a three-way pull-and-push between economics, social unrest, and politics in which one side (the West) is asymmetrically a bit stronger than the other (the East). However, the East has enough tools in its bag of tricks to respond to heavy pushes from the West. 

Not only is this incredibly thematic and well thought out (reading the designers' notes really makes this pop!), but it is also incredibly rich in the mechanics. Each turn is a simple enough, yet sometimes (read: most of the time) a difficult decision: do you want to do something that increase your political, economic, or social capacity? Do you want to strike? Do you want to pick in a preventative manner in order to stop your opponent from doing something that would undo the very thing (and worse!) that what you are about to do? The choices are never easy, and as the designers state, some cards are bitter pills to swallow 

The only thing that is difficult about this game is that you might not get the impact of your tactical card play until the scoring round (which is roughly 7-8 cards played) -- which also makes teaching the game a bit of a challenge. However, this is clearly not a game that is meant to only be played once. It's a masterpiece (plus it has a great modern aesthetic).
-----------------------------------
Update: January 31st 2015
-----------------------------------
After 4 games now, it also shows *just* how different the East and the West must play. Sivel and Sylvester did an amazing job in producing asymmetrical conditions through a game system in which both sides do incredibly similar actions. Furthermore, the way in which the political (i.e., socialist ideology), social (i.e., protest and unrest), and economic intertwine is not only a beautiful thing which speaks to its modern theme, but also incredibly gamey. In other words, while the game effectively has three currencies (social, political, and economic) in which you simply need to win with one, affecting the valuation of one currency affects the other two as well. For example, dealing a blow to socialist ideology means that there will be less socialists willing to come out of the wood works to deal with social unrest when it surfaces. 

East and West are entangled within this beautifully complex dance in which the West leads but in which the East determines the tempo -- while the West is almost always the assailant, the East gets to respond in a way that determines what its own Achilles tendon is. Should the West place the East's economy under pressure, no big deal - build the wall and get the military police to deal with the social unrest. If you're under social pressure, roll in the Russian tanks, devote yourself to socialism, or bring in the Stazi. The East doesn't often get to take the lead, but has many opportunities to respond -- and if it does get to lead, watch out for unwelcome protests in the West (or a sharp drop in economic output).

Just a brilliant game.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Update: August 2015
I'm now ready to give this a 10 now that I've cleared 10 plays. The sense of narrative that this game produces is rich. Furthermore, the extremely rich, complex yet accessible entangled mechanical space is all-too-clever. 

You can see elements of both designers here coming together to make this paired down yet thematic gem - The designer diary tells a story of labour and love that spans years in which both designers bring their respective sensibilities (i.e., rich tension from barebone abstract structures from Sylvester and rich, thematic and balanced asymmetrical play from Sivel).

What's more is that despite the open market which is very gamey in and of itself, there's still room for just enough devious play with a hand of two!

A brilliantly themed two player game of network building and damage mitigation.  Personally, I compare this directly to Twilight Struggle and prefer it on all fronts.  I find the network building and sense of pressure on East Germany to maintain its infrastructure and economy to be more thematic than TS's more abstract area control mechanic, and I prefer the more limited and less chaotic card-play.  Finally, the play time is shorter and not prone to occasional 6 hour marathons...  It should take no more than three hours even for new players, and I reckon it could end up consistently no more than two hours with some experience.

Now here's a thing: a CDG with a low (although not zero) luck factor. Unlike every previous entry in this genre, you aren't at the mercy of which cards you're dealt, there's just a little randomness in the in-hand and undealt cards to shake the game up from playing to playing. West has the one-dimensional position, it just grows it's economy, but must find a way to attack East which has the resources to calm or suppress discontent, and wins by default. Be sure to read the rules carefully as there are plenty of special cases to wreck the game's balance if you miss a rule. It's a very different take on the Cold War to Twilight Struggle, this game has only a small variance with no quick wins, but each playing  has a sufficiently different feel to keep the game fresh. It isn't quite a classic, the end-of-decade scoring is too opaque to create much tension in the card play, you just make your move and hope to come out on top in the reckoning. Still, one of the best CDGs and all that in a very reasonable playing time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
On first impressions this is a very interesting game, with a lot of moving parts which interact in complex ways. The basic engine shares something with the more usual CDG model, in that you're activating cards for either points or for the events, but the twist is that both players are choosing from a lineup of open cards in each half-decade. So the tradeoff becomes using your own strong events before the opponent plays them for the points versus discarding the most dangerous of your opponent's cards and allowing him to get rid of yours. Add to that the significance of choosing the first card, plus the hidden cards players have in hand, and it's a fascinating tightrope. The closest thing I can think of as a comparison to this aspect of the game is the continual balancing act of Twilight Struggle (although there's more open information here so it's more calculable). There are no dice here (and no luck beyond the cards) so this might well appeal to those put off by that aspect of Twilight Struggle.

It seems difficult at first for West to win, since they have to strike the killer blow before the end of the game, and East has many ways to avoid a mass protest type loss: but with repeated plays this tends to even out.

The main problem, in my view, is that the game seems quite prone in some cases to going on a long time after one side has clearly lost. If one side gets into a death spiral early on (lots of unrest, or economic problems) it can be impossible to come back from, since all of your energy is expended on trying to pull back, leaving no opportunities for the attacks which are vital to have a chance of winning; but the actual end of the game might not come for another two decades. Things can become a bit of a foregone conclusion a long time before the game actually ends. But that's a minority of games.

PbeM suitability: works well, although the card plays are often very short. The end of decade phase can take a few swaps back and forth, although usually fewer than 5 or so total. Games run about 80 logs total.

One play only so take rating with a pinch of salt.

Back and forth game using interlocking, abstract Euro-style mechanisms based on the political, economic and cultural struggle between the two halves of the divided, cold-war Germany.

Difficult to do well on your first play against an experienced opponent who understands how the various systems mesh together and how to get the best out of them. I seemed to be doing ok until the last turn's scoring when why board position as the East feel apart without me quite understanding why...

Enough there that the learning curve is pretty steep.

After reading the rulebook and the version 2.0 errata, I played this several times online before finally laying it out on the table. I really enjoy both its Simplicity and the ability to make such meaningful decisions in a relatively short game. It's a great "weuro". Pregaps one if the progenitors of that relatively new cardboard fusion.

There are definitely hints of Volko's COIN system here with the use of political unrest markers but that's where the similarities end. This game manages to incorporate an abstracted version of line of Supply and the card driven play is not only Innovative with its given take but seems to be highly Tactical

Very euro-ish card driven game, absolutely asymmetrical but well balanced, where the events in the cards are key. In fact, the main decisions are choosing to play your events or avoiding the opponent can play his or her ones. I would rate this game higher but the long bureaucracy after each decade is boring and, what is worse, breaks the rhythm (maybe it is a tribute to the former GDR).

It is to appreciate the strong thematic flavor and, presumably, the highest historical accuracy.

During my second play, we realized we had a rule wrong, and corrected for the remainder of the match.  So while I have played twice, I don't think I've seen a valid match yet.  But, based on what I have seen, I see tHis as a strong game.

I'd happily play more.  But I don't see me ever playing it much, so I doubt I add a copy to my collection.  But never say never...

I was pleased to play this a third time, with some further improved understandings to the rules.  The game was again very enjoyable.  I like this game, and could enjoy further plays, should an opportunity arise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
(This is my impression after solitary plays)

Surprisingly smooth mechanics that make more sense than it seems. In no way is it a deep simulation of events, but mechanics are based on realistic interrelations.

The asymmetrical game play, with several winning conditions, keeps it interesting and gives no room for sloppiness. The different tracks might force you to choose a seemingly weaker card just to negate effects of the "End of Decade", maybe as FRG hit hard on the currency and so on.

My rating could very well become higher. I like the design choice of not making this, as it very well could have become, a long slow game.

---

(Update after one play) My rating goes from 8 to 8.5. The game did however turn out to be extremely difficult for West and I don't know how to negate the effect of East getting both Polska/ČSSR on hand and two of the strongest West cards were not included in 1st and 3rd epochs. Maybe the limited number of cards at times result in a bit uneven setup? Probably more plays will reveal how to better react to unfortunate development and what tracks to focus on in attempts to give West the initiative it needs to even have a chance to win.

Personally I really appreciated the game play. My gaming partner did however find the art work unpleasant. It's not in my liking either, but it doesn't bother me much.

The game is clever, at least at first glance. I'm uncertain if I find myself having fun, but after one play I really have very slim grasp of strategy(ies). Be aware that the final decade will be nasty for the East as almost all the events favor the West.  There are definitely clever connections between the mechanisms and the 10 step end of round process is well designed if a bit complex/unwieldy.  The cards can be used in four different ways which creates some difficult decisions at times whether to take an opponent's good event card for one of the other actions instead of taking and using one of your own good cards.

I am a sucker for games that address a specific historical event that isn't a war. My main complaint about civ games is that playing them, you would get the impression that the only notable thing anyone has done in 4000 years is put soldiers on horses and discover gunpowder. Wir Sind Das Volk, a game simulating the tension between East and West Germany from the postwar years to the taking down of the Wall, was a game I was super interested in trying.

The rules were intimidating, but when we dove into playing they were fine. What's tough is figuring out at first how to proceed. An interesting choice in the game is that East can win simply by making it to the end. They don't have to defeat the West, just survive. This is how our game was won, as I was West and didn't get a good idea until late in the game how to directly harm East (for a brief moment at the end I was "winning" but it was before East had a chance to remove unrest.)

This is a really cool game, actually fun and interesting to play, with a great implementation of its theme. I think it sits well next to games such as Twilight Struggle and 1989: Dawn of Freedom.

A true gem, one of the few games that keeps me going into the wee hours of the morning to see how the story unfolds.  Deep and delightfully opaque until one has enough games under one's belt.  Deeply interconnected, like a fine web.  Every decision matters, with a ripple effect that can turn into a tsunami later in the game.  Very intriguing asymmetrical duel game in the vein of Twilight Struggle.  Excellent play-length, it has depth without overstaying its welcome.  The theme is captured very well and is very evocative.  The asymmetrical challenges add to replayability.

Update after 10+ games in just a couple of weeks -- this game is a masterpiece.  It is one of my highest rated boardgames.  Always exciting, so deep, so interesting, so challenging -- I just can't get enough!

What a great game. The theme throughout is fantastic and is what first drew me to it. You are playing either East or West Germany through 4 decades of economic development after the second world war. It's a tough tight game and the card play is exquisitely balanced as you walk the tightrope of decisions.

I wanted to play it a few more times using the new 2.0 version of the rules. To be honest there is not too much of a change, slight changes to the initial set up and one major change to the way East Germany can play their special card of each decade (they either pay for it by discarding one of their hand cards or they allow West Germany to draw a card from the unplayed cards of that decade). The new rule of how the East pays for their special decade card seemed absolutely fine as more often than not they had a card in their hand that they would be happy to discard anyway, in my opinion it just tightens up their ability to control (in favour of the west) who is going to have first choice of the upcoming fresh 7 card display.

I really enjoyed the two plays and would love to play it more. Initially the end of decade clean up/round reset phase (for want of a better term) is foreboding but after a few plays, or even a couple of decades (in game time!), it becomes intuitive and you can start to plan for it in the way you manage economic development.

I have seen comments that the game is unbalanced towards the East, but I have not seen this and stats on results posted on BGG seem to indicate this is not the case either. But despite feeling the game is completely balanced I have never seen a socialist victory. I have to admit it is something I go for every time I play the East but the card play for the socialist track is so tight I feel the West has to be totally negligent in paying attention to it for the East to gain a soicialist victory, the West just has to pick up a few cards decreasing the socialist track and that type of victory is then impossible. But please don't take that as a criticism there are a few different paths to victory on both sides.

There is one thing about the card play I like a lot and is probably the reason why I don't play twilight struggle. I may be wrong here as I have only played it once, but in twilight struggle if you play a card the for points the action always takes place, even if it is for the opposition. I really didn't like that in twilight struggle. In Wir Sind das Volk, if you pay a card for the points the action is disregarded. This, in my view, gives it a lot more flexibility and makes it a much more positive playing experience. The decisions are just as tense but your own card choices don't immediately bite you back. There is though dual card actions/effects that will benefit both sides and in this game you can ignore one symbol of the cards action which mitigates events against you from joint cards that you play.

This is just a great game and I am pretty sure you will like it if you like Twilight Struggle.

Actually quite an impressive game!  Quite tense, each card play was agonized over.  Both our plays ended in steamrolling wins for the West.  I think you need to play a very damn good game to win as the East.  I need to learn some tricks for the East... Perhaps you need to ignore the nasty stuff happening in the East, but work on fermenting instability in the West.

I think it captures the vibrancy of the west versus the east being a run down dump, though playing east doesn't feel that difficult. The east has so many tools to reduce unrest that let it get by, whereas the west has to struggle to place living standard or to snatch the rare unrest reduction card. It also has the difficult task of keeping west berlin happy. Maybe this is historically accurate. The mechanics mesh together in an interesting way. I particularly like the foreign currency requirement. These drive how you build up your economy in a way that is more interesting than just maximizing capacity.

I wanted so much to like this game, I was almost sure that it would be great, considering that one of the authors has designed Maria, which I consider a masterpiece.

I had only one fear: the cards. I don't like games that are guided by cards. I don't like Twilight Struggle too much for this reason. I hoped that this game would have been different. Instead... sadly while playing it I had the same feeling: cards are guiding players. There is not the huge decision space that I search in games. I like when players are in control of their destiny and can make up creative paths to victory. Here it seems to me that strategy is guided by the tactical choices related to the  available cards, while I prefer games in which strategy is leading, games in which players are in full control.

This is a tentative rating, I have to play it more. But I am not so eager to bring it to the table. It is a good game (as twilight Struggle is), but I prefer other games.

A very cool "little" historical game about the divided Germany. 
Very asymmetrical play and interesting gameplay: as DDR I constantly have the feeling of abeing on the edge of loosing the game, while as the BRD you often feel like you're in a much better position, but then there is just this little bit missing to actually crush the DDR and they just make it. 
Really smart and interesting design. It just is such a clever and smooth playing game with so many tough choices, great historical flavour and really interesting asymmetry.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]One of the games I really wish I got to play more often. I played twice more with my buddy Mat who owns the game right after our initial plays, but not since then. I'm not entirely sure why although it is a very confrontation game and you definitely feel like you are taking a beating every turn. Two of our games were really close so even though you always feel like you are on the brink of disaster most games you probably aren't. 

My original thoughts on the game still stand, I think it is brilliant game play wise and the theme shines through. Living through part of the cold war and seeing the Berlin Wall come down definitely enhance the historical aspect of the game. Maybe once my son is older I'll introduce him to the game, it would be a great way to spark some interest and conversation about that period of history with him. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]- The theme/historical basis of this game shines through. 
[i]This game is a perfect vehicle point for getting kids to become interested in the history of East and West Germany and how it impacted the rest of the world. [/i]
- The game play is extremely smooth and intuitive. It will take a few plays to remember how the end of decade scoring works, but everything happening not only makes sense, it also ties in perfectly with the theme. 
- Multi-use cards (which usually have an alignment to one of the two sides), each card functions in multiple ways and the decision of how to use each card really makes you think about your long term strategy [i](usually based on what your opponent is doing)[/i]. 
- A shared card pool, each turn you are selecting a card to play from a shared row. This creates some wonderful tension as you way the benefits of a card that will help you, versus leaving a card you know will be a boon to your opponent.
- It's fun! Seriously, a game like this could crumble under it's own weight but Wir... manages to keep the game play snappy and the rules overhead low creating a really snappy, fun play experience.[/i]

[i]There are many more things I could say about Wir... but really you need to play this game to really appreciate what a brilliant design it is. Kudos to the designers Richard Sivél and Peer Sylvester for creating such an elegant game.
I'm really looking forward to getting in more plays of this brilliant game.[/i]

*第四個時代的特殊牌根據時代結束標記的面放置
2.在開七張公開牌
3.行動階段由聲望軌該顏色玩家先動作，輪流行動可出牌或是選公開區的牌執行(東德可選特殊牌，但選了後東德要棄一張牌或是西德抽一張牌)，行動4選1
>使用自己顏色的牌可免費移除一個動亂標記，使用雙色牌或對方的牌會獲得一個拆除點數
>獲得牌上對應你顏色數字的建築點數建設
>放置多三個水平標記到你的不同省份，每3點工廠總值可放一個，可用卡牌值暫時增加，但每個省份做多+1點，每個放上去的標記移除一個動亂標記(先放到水平標記上，確定OK在移除)
>使用卡上效果，只能使用自己顏色並全部執行或雙色可忽略一個符號，順序由使用玩家決定，除非上面有對應玩家標記
*如果使用了有警察標記的牌則放到東德玩家前面，不放到下方
*如果對應箭頭到底不能移了，則改為對方玩家移除一個動亂標記，威望軌到底可選擇放一個動亂標記到對方省份
4.輪流做到公開區7張用完為止
*下半回合的起始玩家為上半回合的尾家下一家

*每個建設或是拆除點可放一個工廠或是連結(至少一邊有工廠)，連結兩邊有工廠算是工作連結(翻到你的顏色)，工廠起始1，每個工作連結+1，紫色點工廠只會被特殊事件拆除，要拆先拆連結
*倒閉工廠起始值0，不能被拆，工作連結仍會增加他的值
*每當東德有抗議標記時，移動一個粉紅方塊(社會學家)到該區並移除一個動亂標記，直到消掉抗議或是沒粉紅方塊
*每張東德收集到的警察卡可再行動或是結束階段啟動一次來移除1動亂標記，放到該卡上
**結束階段分成10個步驟，利用對應軌記錄**
*當西德沒工廠拆時馬上輸
1.如果是柏林圍牆標記面則，威望軌右移一格，東德獲得1拆除點數
如果是飛機面，根據下方牌上飛機點數+西德最多生活水平的省水平數+東德警察卡數+至少一東德抗議標記(一格) 右移對應格，東德生活水平最低省份的水平數+至少一西德抗議標記(一格) 左移對應格，根據該軌上面數字東德獲得對應拆除點數，目前威望軌在的顏色的人選擇先拆哪，之後輪流一點一點拆，拆完該軌歸0，下面牌棄掉
2.根據威望軌獲得下放對應好處，可向中間選較差的
3.根據外匯軌上數值加上出口收入等於總收入，出口收人為東德每一座出口工廠值大於等於西德最差出口工廠獲得一點收入(相等就算，倒閉的工廠0也會給)，收入扣除東德的生活水平數量如果是負的，每一個值要把一個工廠變成倒閉，工廠不夠就拆連結，選擇都由威望優勢者開始輪流選擇拆(紫色工廠不貢獻收入)
*出口工廠為該省分數值最高的工廠
4.每張警察卡要獲得一點拆除點(自選)
5.每個省分的生活水平指示物如果超過該區的出口工廠值，超過多少就移除多少，西柏林不能超過所有供應省分最差的出口工廠值，多的移除，紫色工廠不算在出口工廠上
6.東西德各自把所有省分生活水平跟其最高的比較，獲得差值-1的動亂標記(西柏林不-1)
7.所有相鄰省分比較生活水平(西柏林跟東柏林還有Bran..相鄰)，差幾個放幾個動亂標記(每個省分只能攻擊一次)，攻擊省分上的每個抗議標記會抵消一個生活水平(可將生活水平放在抗議標記上)
8.東德使用警察卡每張上面可放一個動亂標記，之後把標記移除
9.根據社會主義調獲得對應的粉紅方塊到左上粉紅大格，並對應規則到各省分有抗議標記的消除動亂標記，(如果12個都拿到還要拿東德直接獲勝)，如果要移除粉紅方塊先移大格內在移場上的(放回動亂標記)(沒得移西德獲勝)
10.確認都沒有四面以上抗議標記，有的就輸，一起有東德贏，都沒有就進入下一的時代，用對應時代卡，四個時代結束則東德獲勝
*西柏林永遠不會有工廠，只有當生活水平放到對應的供應省分使得該生活水平比西柏林高時，該生活水平可移動到西柏林，每次行動最多送到一個，且三個供應區的數量要一樣才能繼續往上加(也會移除動亂標記)，當西柏林有抗議標記則東德決定哪一個供應省份也放一個抗議標記(會西柏林抗議標記共存)
*漢堡在結算時可從兩個省份選一個算，不可同時算
*萊茵斯堡只能用事件放特殊工廠，可倒閉(翻面)或是拆除
*四個東德的外境工廠只能用事件蓋，不能被事件以外拆除，跟他的工作連結只能選擇提供給一個工廠

RATING: 9
Innovative design that sees you choosing most of the cards you play from a common pool, visible and open to both players. This gives it something of the feel of a card-drafting game, with much of the same tension: there are probably several cards you'd like to play at any given time, but what if your opponent makes use of them first?
Typical of CDGs, there are puzzly elements here, and the lack of dice makes it an especially thinky game. There's still room for the random and the contingent, for example in the small hand of 2 cards you each receive at the beginning of each decade.
Some claim an imbalance in favour of the East, but judging from statistics compiled by boardgamecore (where the online implementation lives), I think it's more a matter of the West requring more experience to be played competently. There are ways for the West to put the East in serious trouble, but it requires a thorough knowledge of the rules, and familiarity with the cards, on the part of the West player.
The focus on living standards as the issue that most concerned Germans, both West and East, is highly plausible and offers valuable insights into why the GDR collapsed.
Be sure to read the fascinating historical notes to the cards, available in the files section here on BGG.

Solid game. A bit abstract, Go-like even, but the background makes it interesting. Tough decisions for the GDR player, so maybe he should be the more experienced player. Building the wall or not is an interesting turning point.

Update: two plays now. I have to revise that the GDR player has it tougher, in our game even without any industry, the Western player was not able to create enough unrest to bring the East down. Excellent nailbiter finish.

Great two player game with a distinct other feel than most: you really try to bring the opponent down, one way or the other (instead of just doing better than the other). It's great to see the different mechanisms interlock and the multiple usage possibilities of the cards make for some interesting choices. On top of that, the theme and the artwork fit the game extremely well.

Only three games in it's hard to judge a game that seems to promise as much as this one. The last time I felt this much anticipation about climbing a learning curve was Pax Porfiriana. So many things I love: a modern-day political theme; card-driven actions; asymmetry; multiple victory conditions; the list goes on. Those first three sessions have each played out promisingly differently too. You have to choose which pressure point you're going to aim for and drive it hard, and that decision causes the action cards to be valued very differently from game to game. The thematic modelling is wonderful too. I'm not ready to call it yet, but this has potential to be a masterpiece.

EDIT: after a dozen plays, I'm ready; it's a masterpiece.

Despite a ten phase end of decade round, and lots and lots of weird interactions and asymmetry, I found the game to be really streamlined once you get past the first decade. I can't even imagine how they got the game to be balanced, but it's really impressive, and it seems like once you have the basic rules down, it doesn't take longer than the box's listed length (150 minutes) to play. I'm really excited to have gotten this game onto the table, and I think now that I've gotten it out once, I'll be far more confident to get it out again.

August 2015: Twilight Struggle is unfortunately better than this -- I do appreciate that the box is quite tiny for a game this complex.

The game does play faster and smoother than Twilight Struggle, though. It's less tense, though, for two main reasons:

* Card play: Most cards are drafted from an open pool of cards. So there's less tension. Also the cards are less powerful. Scoring rounds happen very predictably, unlike TS.

* The core mechanic of building influence on the map -- network building -- is not as interesting or dramatic. 

Update, two weeks later: Raised rating from 6 to 8.

A quick loss by the West player because of oversight and poor understanding of the rules can ruin the experience.

Don't compare this to Twilight Struggle. Twilight Struggle attempts to simulate the tensions, distrust, and paranoia of the Cold War. Wir Sind Das Volk is about the East surviving long enough to win.

Wir Sind Das Volk plays incredibly fast! 150 minute playing time? More like 90 minutes!

RATING: 8
This game has two (or even three) faces.

First - historical background, honey and milk for history buffs, lots of interesting facts on cards good asymmetric mechanics with interesting connections to political and economical situation in divided Germany (socialist cubes, rundown of east economy, people running to the West or Stasi cards all make sense and give flavor)

Second - economy game engine - nice an easy to learn, "Powergrid" like p2p connection and reversed area control ( the less protest cubes you have in the area the better) make sense and make up for nice euro - economic engine

Third - the ugly face - decade summary - this part is most complicated and confusing for beginners. Huge changes on board are provoked by previous actions - and it's hard to imagine how actions will affect the final outcome after decade. It should be easier after a few plays but it can be frustrating or even lead to premature game end.

But if you have time and will to invest this game is very satisfying  - especially for history fans.

Juegazo!!. No se si sera por el sabor historico que te deja de una epoca que me atrae mucho, o por que el juego me da la sensacion de que esta bien hilado o por ambas quizas, pero a mi me ha encantado. Eso si, las reglas a pesar de ser cortas se hacen un poco confusas en algunos puntos, como algunas fases de final de decada. Una vez que juegas una decada todo parece mas claro, no asi las implicaciones de las acciones que llevas a cabo, hace falta jugar alguna partida mas para optimizar las decisiones que hay que tomar con respecto a las acciones y sus repercusiones en el juego.

Deseando volver a jugarlo.

RATING: 8
Astounding first play experience. Thirsting for more.

(+) Extremely engrossing, in the sense that you are slowly losing control/feeling daggers of oppression depending on the side you play.  
(+) The war for economic control on the map coupled with tough operational choices on the cards contribute to the tension.
(+) The game creates a story so incredibly interesting yet does not take a backseat to gameplay--maintaining economy, ensuring or mitigating socialism, inciting or suppressing riots--there are game-y aspects there that do not overwhelm but instead build a powerful narrative.  

(-) Plays out over a long period of time.  
(-) Can be challenging to learn.  
(-) Niche theme and game. Not for everyone.  

Honestly, this game is rather difficult to fault without being punitive. If you like the theme, and you enjoy historically-grounded games, then you will adore this game. If you don't enjoy those types of games, this will make you a believer.

Very interesting game after one play.  Have the mechanics down, now need to play again to get a better grasp on the interplay between them to see how I can manipulate game situation.

With the various cards and the various actions, feel there are lots of interesting decisions as the game unfolds.

A neat game with elements of economy building and card-driven wargames.  I'm not sure how much agency the players really have, or if most of it is driven by what cards come out.  However, I'd need to play again -- there are certainly some intriguing dynamics going on.  I'd also need to better internalize the somewhat obtuse end-of-decade scoring rules; more familiarity might reveal more depth.

Rather complex but highly thematic game that reminds a bit of "Twilight Struggle". Of course it feels different but it's still a "war" betweeen two systems. First play was to learn ... I'm looking forward to getting it on the table for further exciting evenings.

At first I thought I was rating this a little higher than the gameplay warranted because the theme is so well integrated and so well thought out, but now I'm feeling even more positive about it. Sure, historical flavour comes at the expense of adding excess fiddliness and rules headaches, but that's what I really appreciate in a game. (Note to self: Remember the double unrest markers if West Berlin is in unrest!) The good news is that by the end of your first game you'll have it all sorted out. It could have been an easy fix right off the bat if a summary card had been provided though.

Several plays in and we're comfortably completing our games in 90 minutes. It seems a little trickier to win as West Germany. Getting great value out of this little tussle though. The wife thinks it's a travesty that Köln makes it on the map and not Bonn, but I think a factory on Bonn would devalue factory production.

I love the theme and that real care has been taken to make a game out of it. At its core it's a card driven game and that normally means questions about the interpretation of cards and how it interacts with the board. Here it's very simple and straightforward. Anyone familiar with Twilight Struggle would pick it up in no time. Cards have four potential uses and with most information open it tends to play quickly with experienced players. Luckily we've been surprised how differently the game can play depending upon the approach players take. The goal is the same - oversee the collapse of your opponent's society, but there's a few ways to approach this. East Germany tends to try and hang on while holding back West Germany's growth. West Germany can certainly outgrow East Germany in terms of production and luxury goods, but can they limit access to Western currency while at the same time limiting their turn to socialism? Will East Germany need to bring out their big events and build the Wall or bring in tanks? It'll cost them prestige for sure. Are they going to need to resort to a police state at the expense of their production?

There's a multitude of ways to approach it and not only does it immerse you in historical flavour, it's also fun. The more I play it the more I'm enjoying it. It's not quite as deep as 1989, but it plays faster, comes in the ideal box size and is very good.

WSdV represents a great board game concept and is a mechanically sound, even innovating game. 

However, after a handful of plays (5 as I am typing this), I am not fully convinced that the sides are balanced. As many others have pointed out, the East seems to be the much easier side to win with. I am sure the designers and play testers have played this game many times and have tried hard to balance the game, so for now I am assuming that I simply have not played the game enough to have figured out the good strategic options with the West.

I really dig this game. It just hits all the right notes for me. Some reviewers describe this as an economic confrontation game and I think that pretty well sums it up. The end of the decade phase is a little hard to grok and seems chaotic but it just oozes with theme.

I've played several times and continue to look forward to my next play. It's tough to learn. I still struggle with keeping the rules straight, as the rules overhead is higher than I'd like. But it's got so much of what I like--asymmetry, alternate victory conditions, a bit of luck, and deep interaction--that I'm willing to climb the learning curve. My only real concern is long-term balance and replayability. I wonder if it'll hold up over many plays or if it'll be solved/scripted due to insufficient randomness. A few extra cards might have helped on that front.

Update: Turns out I was right that it was solved/scripted. To their credit, the designers have revised the rules to patch it. Time will tell if the fix solves the problem.

RATING: 7.5
After 9 more plays (mostly online at play.boardgamecore.net) as both East and West, I find I am enjoying this more and more. Yes, you spend a lot of time just building stuff; but you spend a lot of time in Twilight Struggle just placing influence -- both make sense; in an economic game, you build your economy; in an area-control game, you build your majorities. I still find TS cards much more interesting, but the asymmetry here is pretty cool! The is card management is quite fun: do you go for card denial, or take the one that will really help you? With only 7 in display, whoever goes first will get an extra action in the half-decade. That will even out, of course, except that the East has access to one more card; plus, having first crack at the cards (in the second half of the decade) seems to be pretty handy! And East doesn't always want to trigger that special event. 

This is a very good, assymetric card-driven game. The end-of-decade sequence is a bit cumbersome and hard to grok; not complicated, really, but it just has too many steps to be intuitive without playing the game a few (or several) times. Even then, I end up mostly playing with general principles (e.g., as East you need to build a lot of infrastructure to withstand the dismantling) rather than having a specific idea of exactly what I need to have on the board. I have found East a bit more fun to play, though, likely because it is not as straightforward as the West.

For me, this is still not as good as Twilight. It does have a few advantages, though:
- this is faster (but not too fast -- short games suck!)
- this has a bit less luck of the draw, since you only have a hand of 2 cards (x 4) while the bulk of cards are in a single, common, public pool

6.5 --> 7.5
--------
2 plays, as West

I went into his very excited: great theme, terrific designers, etc. But in the end this didn't quite live up to my expectations. As West, it seems the only thing to do is to raise living standards. Sure, you could say that In Twilight Struggle you're just spreading influence. But TS, with multiple arenas (continents), semi-random scoring timing, and more varied events (here, you just twiddle a few tracks or deal with unrest) is far more interesting. In WsdV, you (West) simply must raise LS. It seems the main question is whether you concentrate on Berlin, to attack East Berlin and Brandenburg, or the border provinces instead (concentrate on Thuringen?). As East, you mostly try to survive, maybe get lucky with the Socialists ... winning by mass protest seems exceedingly difficult. 

Need to try again, as East, but I don't think this will knock Twilight Struggle down off its high perch!

The first play through was very much a learning game and I don't doubt that we got at least some rules wrong. That said, I quite enjoyed it, though it wasn't immediately clear the benefit of many of the actions and how they'd result in a win/loss.

A player aid is pretty much a necessity for this game.

With repeated play, this could easily become a really deep and tense game. In our first play we had East Germany in collapse at the middle of our game just trying to stay alive until the end of the 4th decade while West Germany tried to drive home its advantage. I suspect the game was over by this point but it took almost 2 full decades to finally collapse. The problem is that it wasn't much fun for East Germany just trying to stave off collapse.

Update: After 2 additional plays this is still feeling incredibly opaque and it's hard to hold in your head all of the potential outcomes of your actions. That might prevent it from hitting the table as much as I'd like, but I'm enjoying the game immensely.

We invested about two dozens of hours to master how to play as the West effectively without any luck. Perhaps it is our fault, but the forums indicate otherwise - other people reported the same issue with the game (i.e., the East seems to be unbeatable). As a comparison: we had no issue playing games like Twilight Struggle or 1989 - which made us want to play this one. If you had the same motivation, think twice before jumping into this. For us, it's never again, we gonna' stay as far as possible from this one.

Played a few turns at Essen. Unfortunately we did not get a full explanation of the rules so I cannot rate the game yet. 

It felt a bit dry to me because building industrial infrastructure is not as cool as building armies... 

The game is quite "opaque" for new players. We often had an idea about the one or two very good cards that were playable, but regarding the other five or six cards, we had no idea which were good or important to play.

Reading the names of events that I had not heard much about (if anything) made me curious and maybe I will buy the game one day just for the history lesson.

This game just plain is close to home for me (literally). And the CDG approach and structure (not unlike TS) interests me. Now having read the rules, this is a really deep game with great ideas in its design. It feels a bit like a two player state of siege game for the east, you are constantly fighting fires and every achievement you make will be hit hard at decade end, so you better prepare for that. Lots of interesting decisions to make.

This game is really a gem !
This is a duel, as tense as Twilight Struggle, but in two hours only. 
No swingy Scoring cards here, but a very clever use of the deck. Per decade you have 14 events to choose from and 4 unknown, from which 2 will occur… or not.
This gives you more control, but also leads to agonizing decisions.

Innovative and fascinating; in one word… outstanding.

The learning curve for WsdV! is rather steep because the end of decade scoring is so complex and it's hard to see how your choices influence it initially. As it begins to open and become less opaque a great game is hidden here. I prefer it to Twilight Struggle because it is less about managing your own hand due to the shared card area and because it isn't as repetitive.

Expansion: Wir sind das Volk!: 2+2.

RATING: 3
First play and I'm not too sure of what to think. 

There's a semi-interesting game here but it doesn't capture the same kind of magic that Twilight Struggle does. I'd pick Twilight Struggle over this every day of the week and I think the fact that it relies heavily on icons detracts from the theme. I think this design choice, the fact that it's heavy on icons, means that players don't necessarily need to read the event names at all. I think this takes a lot away from the experience.

A lot of my opinions are a comparison between Wir Sind Das Volk! and Twilight Struggle, so bear with me. Part of the beauty of Twilight Struggle is the combination of theme and mechanics to create a 'what if' scenario. There is a real global struggle that is played out on the board, sacrifices have to be made to further your agenda. You learn to fear and cheer certain events as you and your opponent play them. While Wir Sind Das Volk! is played on a much smaller scale comparably, none of the events are memorable. Twilight Struggle dresses up the push-pull and cold war buildup through the memorable cards, Wir Sind Das Volk! does not.

What you're left with is a really mechanical, calculable exercise. Why calculable? Because the majority of the cards are in a common pool. You spend a few minutes looking at the common pool and looking at your two cards and working out which cards you need to take and when. I take this card to build up 3, then you take this card to take away 4, then I take this card to push this track right x spaces, then you take that card to push this other track left y spaces. At this point, who cares what the events are or what they're called.

The end of age/era multi-step process resolution is clunky at best. I simply spent too much time trying to work out this process than enjoying the actual game. It's predictable and takes away from the tension compared to the variable time scoring found in Twilight Struggle.

There's really two flaws in this design; the first being the large shared pool of cards which has thus influenced the design to heavily rely on icons. The second being the end of age/era multi-step resolution. Because of this, I don't think this game is quite there.

In the end, a second game never came. There was just no enthusiasm to get this back to the table and thus I sold it off. It's really disappointing, I admire both designers, they've created some real gems in the past. This isn't one of them though.

Update 17/03/15: I've had this on my mind as more and more people have sung this game's praises. I've updated the comment to hopefully better reflect my views and downgraded the rating from a 4 to a 3.

Update 21/06/17: This thread is highly entertaining: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1357663/balancing-game/page/1

Bumping this one back up half a point after spending some more time with it. A good game very much depends on the West player knowing how to apply pressure to the East. There are some great moments where the theme bleeds out of the game. For example: it hit me the other day what having the East play Prague Spring to build industry across the border from Czech implies. Internalizing the mechanics makes it easier to enjoy the story of the game.

RATING: 8
This is fun, card-driven, Twilight Struggle type of game set in Cold War Germany. Instead of politics though, this one focuses on economic infrastructure, standards of living, and popular revolt. It plays very quickly, usually under an hour and a half, once both players know what they are doing. The paths to victory are a little bit obtuse, but they come into focus after a game or two.

My only minor complaint is the lack of notation for East German or West German specific cards. The line drawings on the cards are sort of colored yellow or pink depending on which side they serve, but it isn't always clear. Particularly when the draft row is also full of mixed cards that depict both yellow and pink in the same artwork. It makes the whole row look muddled and hard to parse. I'm not sure why they just didn't color the numbers yellow or pink as appropriate and leave it at that.

It's not a deal-breaker, as it is usually pretty obvious when looking at the effects who it is intended for. It's just an irritation that slows down learning how to play the game. Otherwise, it's a great game. They've done a good job with the iconography too, making it pretty easy to resolve the cards when they are played...since there is no text at all to slow you down.

Had no interest in this game before I tried it. It turned out to be surprisingly good. If you like bluffing and doublethink this is a winner. I've had fun every time I've played.

Picked this one up for a whopping 3 Euros at Essen 2010. I had been vaguely interested in the game before, but the ridiculously low price finally made me pull the trigger. And what can I say? Our first play definitely was more than 3 Euros worth of fun! Nice tactical game with a slight bluffing element that has its share of randomness but also of meaningful decisions.

RATING: 7
Possibly my favorite filler game.  It requires more thinking than Lost Cities and far more bluffing.  I really like the agents and the chaos that they create as well as limiting the cards used for a country.  The Blackjack mechanic reminds me of how Battleline uses the poker mechanic in a non-gambling setting.  Just a really smart game.  I'll play it in a heartbeat.

RATING: 6
Initial rating.  It was 90-120 minutes, rather than 30.  I know it had a bit of a learning curve, but it was kinda long.  It had many things going on in it, but primary among them was bluff and double-bluff, moreso than card play.  I'll probably pick it up as the size and price are terrific.

I enjoyed this game, quick, simple, elegant, but I've got a problem with the combat cards and politic cards, together in the same hand with the right timming, they are simply overpowered, it have some strategy of course, but the lucky here plays a lot in this game.

[b]After 5 plays[/b]:
It's push-your-luck, blackjack style! The fact that you can use the cards (GROUPS) in order to modify yours or your opponent's "hand" makes it interesting. Although luck plays a very big part (especially for the "6" OBJECTIVE cards, with just one card). The AGENTS are semi-useless, with just 2 types that are usually played.

CONCLUSION - a nice and light filler (although it takes kinda of long time)

Card play is generally obvious/dull/raw luck.  Blackjack + secret role selection, not very interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
A poker game that is limited by the game's agent that you sent for to 'fight' for an objective that is basically a number/VP.

There is more to the cold war than this. If it was themed differently, I would have liked it more.

Finally got around to trying this game - the rules were a bit taxing to figure out, but once we got going, Cold War was very enjoyable! Note-to-self: All group cards get shuffled back in at the end of each round, event card abilities are played by the side that won it during the phase indicated on the card, and both players must consecutively pass to go to the influence counting phase. UPDATE: A keeper with a great cold war theme. 2015 UPDATE: This one was a toughie as I read a ton of reviews and reread the rules. Decided to hold onto this and demo it when I get a chance. Seems tactical and quick.

Black jack or "Las siete y media" (Seven and a Half) reworked into a modern game. It's one of my favorite two player games, pretty much a filler one, with some deep and bluffing.

The game has an important luck factor, but the bluffing part that some of the agents provide to the game makes it a great game.

That said, it can be annoying losing some of the most fun agents early, making the game a little more boring for the person without them.

Solid filler game with great theme and some neat gameplay twists. I don't like the "event" objectives at all, though. They do get more interesting if you face the same opponent for a few games, though, as some will prefer Director or one of the "carryover" agents (Double Agent/Analyst) when these objectives turn up and you can tailor your strategy around your opponent's preferences.

"blackjack: the gathering" seems to be an appropriate moniker.  i expected to be disappointed with the lack of asymmetry between sides, but i think it works great as-is since both are trying to outguess what roles the other might pick.  healthy doses of luck, especially with the one-population cards.  quite easy to understand, and enough familiarity in both theme and mechanics to draw one in without causing it to feel derivative.  still not excited about it, though.

While I understand the direction the game was going for, the actual execution was poorly implemented. For one, the entire bluffing element is underdeveloped; mechanically, the game provides little concrete information for players to make informed decisions. Secondly, the special effects of various cards sounds intriguing but the decisions are quite superficial. In some cases (Events), there is barely a decision to be made. The end result is a random push-your-luck filler that overstays its welcome.

The rules make the game look more complicated than it really is, but once you get past that, it's very good. Take a look at the revised (and greatly improved) rules by Liumas on the game's BGG page as well as his rules brief. This will make the game much easier to learn. The luck of the draw effect may not work well for some however, but it is certainly a worthwhile 2-P game.

Played once.  I think this is a game of missed opportunities.  The designers had some good ideas here yet missed others.  Why not give each player a hand of cards that they can choose from?  That would have added the possibility of more strategic play.  Oh, and what is with the events having a population of only one?  Clearly a house rule needs to be implemented allowing two cards on events, otherwise they are virtually a crap shoot.  Oh yeah!  Why have points increase in increments of five?  What is up with that?

I really enjoyed the game. The theme is only necessary with the Agnet-X cards, but that is where the strategy is hidden. Mind games are awesome when you try to think what you opponent is trying to do and why he/she is not trying to go higher than he is going!

Quick little two player filler with a nice theme. While the game is based on blackjack this fits the Cold War theme very well.

Sometimes the game can seem to play itself as the best action is obvious. But for a filler there is enough going on to keep my interest.

Interesting little card game, a pretty simple arrangement of building up point totals in cards while simultaneously using a handful of card "powers" to muck things up.

Just okay.  I don't like the low number of "support cards" required to finish the missions... especially the single card missions for which the winner is random.  Also, you really need to play against the same opponent multipe times to get to know his/her style of play... without knowing your opponent, you won't know which secret agent you should play (or not play).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Decent card game, in a "Twilight Struggle - the Card game" vein. Fight over battlegrounds with spies and groups, but don't score too high on hte groups and get over the limit on the objective card or you go in to civil disorder. 

Neat mechanics for swapping, viewing, burning, using, refreshing the groups cards you use to thay the game gives you something decent to think about. 

This is definitely a good card game of the super-filler type. The score cards, beads and markers are a bit of added chrome, which could have been replaced by cards and/or doing your sums!

Black-jack with a twist. And the theme fits too. Like this one a lot, and I can see with repeated plays with the same opponent the mind game of "has he sent the master spy" or "is it the assassin" really kick in - only bit I don't like are the 1 card 'events' they are pretty much a lottery even if you have the token (as you have no idea usually what the top cards are), I think I prefer the game with these removed!

RATING: 9
This is one of those games that creep up on you.  A surprisingly clever and tense game for two players. While it is basically a variant on the game of blackjack, the initial decisions here are nail-biting and can have a huge affect on the outcome of each hand.
The game mechanic is really quite simple, but the play takes much thought and is extremly satisfying. I noticed that someone had complained that there was too much luck in this game...they sure missied the idea that luck is negated by strategic and tactical play.  One of my favourite two-player games

First Play: 1/25/208
Two player card based game which is close to 'blackjack' in its play mechanics, with each card 'suit' having a special ability.

Plays quickly, and has a few elements of bluffing and strategy in it.

Components are solid, poker chips are nice.

Card driven nature can lead to luck being a very high factor.

Metagame of agent selection will probably develop with a more solid understanding of the objectives.

Need to reshuffle the groups EVERY ROUND is slightly bothersome - replacing groups with thick cardboard tokens and pulling them from a bag might go faster, but would require uniform backs for the Analyst to be possible.

Nice small box, just the right size to hold the cards and other components.

I really enjoy this 2 player game. It's fun and not too deep. I would really love this game but I feel like there is something missing from the mechanics to make it perfect. Honestly can't put my finger on it, but I feel like the fact that you can see each others score makes a round last a little longer than it should. The back and forth can be a little annoying....but I still have fun every time I play it.

The heart of this game is the bluff and attempting to guess the identity of your opponent's agent.  Blackjack also doesn't allow for stealing or discarding your opponent's cards.  I could easily see my rating for this going up with more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A neat game that feels like a complex trick taking game.  The agents add an element of bluff and double guess, which is good fun.

Altogether an engaging game that, despite a theme I am simply not that interested in, manages to retain my interest throughout.  It is fun.

I was really surprised by this one. What I thought was just a blackjack variant is actually a subtle and fascinating bluffing/push-your-luck/trick-taking game. Deciding whether to go for an objective, deliberately lose the challenge, or try to take out your opponent's agent is very tricky (especially when you know your opponent is thinking the same thing). Small clues about which agent your opponent has been played can be read by which group cards he has played, stolen, or discarded. Seeing that you are going to lose a challenge, and risking it all by drawing more cards, is often very fun.

The game runs a little long for what it is (I think playing to 75 or 80 points is ideal), and I can see this getting "samey" after too many plays, but I like it for its extreme portability and psychological game play.

RATING: 6
This is a pretty fun deceptively deep card game for 2 players. The rules are simple, but the card interactions are what drive the tactics forward. I was initially unsure about the "luck" factor in the game, since you have to draw and play cards one-by-one, rather than holding a hand of cards to pick from. But after playing the game, a lot of the luck can be mitigated by clever manipulation and combos of card abilities after they are in play. This game has a lot of levels of strategy and tactics, all of which are pleasantly deep, but not overwhelmingly so. The thing I like the best about the game is that it allows for thoughtful play, while not enabling AP players to sit there pondering for 10 minutes on their turn.

5/7/15 - Downgraded the rating to 6, based on the fact that the redesigned version (Star Wars: Empire vs Rebellion) fixes the issues I disliked about this game. Now this game will not see much table time at all.

Love this two-player game.  It is abstract in many ways, but uses text and imagery to strongly involve the theme.  The mechanics - blackjack with embellishments and CCG card use - evoke the Cold War as well.  ---  Look, as much as my wife loves me, she is not going to play Twilight Struggle while our three kids look on in rapt wonder.  However, she and I pulled this out at a coffee shop on a date and really, really liked it.  Plus, this entire game can fit easily in a good-sized pants pocket.  Portable, engaging, unpredictable yet strategically interesting - a really great game.  Bravo.

Ok, we didn't got to finish this game, so my comment and rating is probably not 100 % fair. Anyway, my first impression wasn't the best. The game seemed a bit uninteresting and it seemed that there was too much luck in the group phase. I do think it could be semi-fun and semi-interesting when playing a couple of games and bluffing and double bluffing, but I'm pretty sure I won't find out as I would much rather play something else.

Sure, some folks complain that this game is boring since it relies on chance.  Guess what...OF COURSE it does...you're picking cards from a deck!  Got this as a quick 2-player game.  Rules are muddled at some points, but after ironing out some of the kinks, the wife and I absolutely love it.  Fun to play, good to root out who's more devious too!  Excellent production value on the cards.  We love getting this out when we've 30-45mins to kill. We highly recommend.

If you like playing Mille Bornes, you should pick up the mechanics of this game fairly quickly.

Only played it once, but I liked it. As a two player game, I'm limited in my options, and my wife is drawn to other games. I'd like to give this one a couple more shots.

Update: I still think it's a good light game, but I'm just not finding anyone to play it. Most gaming is done in a group of more than two people.

Update: Eh. Never got it to the table. Traded it along with Stone Age for Manila.

Black jack with more bluffing and a few more options.  Good for a quick two player game because you can scale the end point scoring to however long you want to play.  There is a fair amount of doublethink in my games, as we try to determine if we are being savvy, or if our opponent is losing the match on purpose.  It actual does seem to capture a theme of constant wariness about what in the hell your opponent is up to.

RATING: 6
This genre is not my favorite, so that colors my rating a bit.  That said, I think Cold War is very good at what it does.

Firstly, the components are excellent. And card art is also very theme-evoking. I think a good eye for detail is evident here, and I appreciate that.

Cold War boils down to a game of bluffing, with some variable player powers in symmetric decks, and a thin theme. The theme holds up, for me. Its close enough. I just find that the decisions are usually fairly straightforward unless you have or suspect your opponent of having your "master spy" in play (the guy that reverses the way the VPs are rewarded). If that's the case, you actually want to LOSE the hand so that you can be rewarded as though you won. Remove that bluff element, and the game doesn't quite have enough going on to hold my attention.

I think overall its a well designed game, and that the bluffing element is very rich. I just don't seem to enjoy it very much. This says more about me than it does about the game.

RATING: 7
A neat game with outstanding graphic design that will likely be ignored by folks clamoring for the same old bullshit released at Essen '07.  COLD WAR is a better, and much more interesting, 2 player game than most of the beloved Kosmos "Games for 2" line and beneath its Blackjack-derived core mechanic (which fits the theme of Cold War bluffing and brinksmanship perfectly) lies a pretty tense game with a lot of tit-for-tat, back and forth, and some surprise changes in circumstance.  I don't think it's a watertight design- there's too many points where the game feels too deterministic and you're pretty much stuck doing the only thing you can possibly do and a couple of the agents are definitely less useful than others but by and large it's a good game that will probably hold my interest as a 2 player, 30 minute game for a while.

Some called it a "Gamers Black Jack" ... but the "push your luck" card draw is only one of the mechanisms in this game. But there is more ... the choice of the agents - the function of each faction ... and it creates over and over interesting stand offs and possibilities to bluff and double-bluff your opponent.
Of course - history buff that I am - I also love the theme!

The power of the pass. That's what I took away most from Cold War - it's just as strategic to decide when not to take an action as it is to take one.

A great little card game in which one player takes on the role of the CIA and the other of the KGB, or what else did you expect from this title? Both try to win over targets (mostly countries, some of the target cards are events, which can be used later on in the game, but if you do, you lose points) by means of military, political, economic or media intervention cards. Each target has to be won by means of a limited number of intervention cards (the maximum is indicated on each target). Each intervention card is worth a number of influence points. You have to take care not to flaunt your influence too conspicuously though. When the total of your influence points exceeds the stability value of the target, civil unrest is the outcome, and that's the end of your secret agent. They are sent out to win over the hearts and minds of the people, not to create endless turmoil.
It's a small game with simple rules, but it does a great job as a story telling game.

Sort of a 45-minute, cards-only, push-your-luck version of Twilight Struggle.  Nothing fancy, but good fun.

We decided to play to 50 instead of 100 since we were pulling all the low-value objectives and the game was taking a little too long.  It appears we were victims of a bad deal (and were both first-time players) since only 6 out of 21 objectives are so small, but playing to 50 worked fine.

UPDATE: Played some more -- IMO it's a good idea to play to 50 the first game, since it takes a little while to get the hang of things.  Once things are moving along, 100 is a good target.

I was so hoping to like this, but it didn't grab me at all.  There just weren't enough meaningful choices to be made, given the "draw off the top and play" mechanism.  Maybe if you had a hand of cards, drew to refill, and could play from the hand...but even then, it was just too much frustrating/luck-based.  Admittedly there were *some* choices, and *some* neat things/combos you could pull off; but just not enough for me.

The Mystery Rummy games are an interesting spin on the traditional Rummy card game. Cold War is an interesting spin on the traditional Blackjack card game. Mystery Rummy is a better variant than Cold War is when you look at their respective games. There is a fair amount of deductive element when it comes to picking your Agent X, but the Blackjack game play of recruiting your people and using their abilities are rather drab and luck based. This had a lot of potential but fell flat for me. Your mileage may vary.

The event cards in the deck are a little hit and miss as there is a limit of one card so its usually high card wins but the nations have a nice amount of bluffing and planning and to and fro-ing which usually makes this a very close fought out game.

RATING: 6
Grew on me slowly. More to this than first seems from the basic pontoon mechanism. Gradually, understanding the ways to combine the simple card actions (kill, give/steal, preview, reset), and how to play the Agent X powers, adds some dimension to the game. But still, lots of extra rules on cards, fairly repetitive process, a bit long for what it is. But with nice graphics, good use of contemporary photos and groups, the theme works.

Takes a couple of rounds for the strategies to kick-in between the 2 players, and then it gets interesting.  Last game we played was a real back-and-forth close one.  While there is a push-your-luck element to this game, by the time someone gets to 100 points the player making the better choices is usually the winner.  I have only played a few times but the more I play the closer the game gets as it ends.

My wife enjoys this game a lot.

The blind guessing and bluffing that you use with the agent cards is not my favorite mechanic.  I like the theme but the cards repeat themselves too often (not much variety here, I saw more of Jane Fonda than Ted Turner ever does) and the blind guessing undercuts any depth it might have and keeps it feeling light. However it's a snappy little card game.  I'd like to play more and see if it grows on me...

This is a very fun tactical bluffing game. It can be agonizing to decide which agent to send out each round, but the choices in the meat of the game where cards are flipped to resolve each conflict tend to be fairly obvious with a healthy dose of "press-your-luck" thrown in.  I love the poker/blackjack feel, as so much rides on every card that's played.  This is a home-run for a medium-light 2-player card game of matching wits.

RATING: 10
This is my favorite two player card game ever.  While it is quite strategic and "dripping with theme" (yeah I hate that expression too, I'm a hypocrite) the best part is the "yomi" aspect of predicting your opponents move by intuition (and limiting his options) and the way that allow epic come backs without forced catch up mechanics.  

The original version with the heavy plastic chips, glass counters and bigger agent cards is worth hunting down, but I am glad FF put it back in print with the slightly chintzier components if that's would it took to spread to get it back into print.

RATING: 5
All the bluffing and double-guessing made the theme come alive pretty well in this one I thought, even though in essence it's just a form of Black Jack with special powers and some additional doohickeys tacked on. Still, the card play is pretty neat and works well at least as long as your more interesting agents haven't all been eliminated.

What brings the rating of the game down for me is that it takes much too long. The most important missions score 20 points but there are many with just 5 or 10, and the game ends only when a players reaches 100. That's a not very unlikely 20 to 30 rounds you're looking at. I'd rather play a second match at half the time.

Les premières parties n'étaient pas vraiment géniales. Et puis, on a vu l'errata et le rajout aux règles qui enlève ce qui fait tout le piment du jeu. Du coup, les parties suivantes étaient nettement plus intéressantes et amusantes.

Sans doute pas le meilleur jeu dans ce format, un peu long pour un "petit jeu", un peu répétitif également, mais qui passe bien entre deux plus gros jeux ou avec quelqu'un qui n'est pas tellement orienté "jeux de plateau". Parce que malgré le nombre de pages, les règles sont simples. Simples, mais efficaces et avec juste ce qu'il faut de subtilité (le bluff dans le choix des personnages, tous d'intérêt à peu près égal selon les situations) pour ne pas être un jeu où seul domine le hasard et l'équilibre risque/prudence dans le tirage des cartes "Groupe". La part d'aléatoire reste importante dans le tirage des cartes, difficilement maîtrisable malgré le pouvoir de certaines des cartes. Mais finalement, le défaut de la durée du jeu compense ce facteur chance : elle a le temps de tourner, car les 100 points ne sont pas atteints en trois tours. Certes, parfois elle ne tourne pas. Mais elle peut, c'est déjà ça.

Dans les autres points positifs, il y a les cartes, souvent un peu clichées mais souvent amusantes (le second degré est-il désiré ?), que ce soit dans les illustrations ou l'association nom/niveau de la carte. Il y a aussi le thème, pas forcément ultime mais qui colle bien au jeu et à la logique d'influence et de désordre civil mettant à mort les agents (sauf le "Directeur adjoint", le fameux joué quand on ne sait pas quoi faire). Le plus intéressant, c'est cette règle annulée par ce qui est écrit. Déclencher désordre et se battre pour en sortir devant le regard amusé de son adversaire, c'est le moment le plus plaisant de la partie (avec celui de la révélation des rôles, notamment le "Maître-espion").

Un bon jeu à deux donc, malgré les défauts suscités, qu'on sort de temps à autre pour faire une partie, éventuellement une revanche, avant de le remettre au placard pour un certain temps.

Then I recruit the Police, who kill your Funadmentalists."Good quality stuff in the package, a decent value for $20.   EDIT:  Goofy madlibs aren't enough to keep this one--pretty much left me "Cold".

It is so heavily luck based, that it really has to be the type of game you want to play- one that has a great theme but doesn't have enough control to mitigate the luck elements. Plus, there are such wild point swings that winning feels spoiled. There is definite bluffing in this game, but there are better bluffing games and better 2-player card games. I would always pass this one up, so can't think of why I would keep it.

Two-player Black Jack with some special powers tossed in.  I feel Cold War is a fun filler/time killer aided by its theme, but I wish the choices involved had more weight.  If one card in the groups pool was secret, it seems that a great bluffing element could be added to the game- might have to try this.

As of now a six.

UPDATE: After a few plays this just doesn't excite.  Bland, repetitive play.

 Really fun and gratifying cold war themed card game. The group card abilities make it interesting in that you can continue to acquire, destroy, and reuse  cards already in play.

Kind of fun, much too long though. We only ever play to 50 rather than 100. It's a lot like blackjack, you wanna push your luck but if you bust(go over a certain number) you lose. Introduces ways of reversing the bust. Each round reaches an anti-climatic ending where there is no more you can do. The character cards add a bit of bluffing and strategy, but still a very luck based game.

Surprisingly good card game. It's a constant challenge to outguess your opponent's choice of agent that determines his or her variable player power.

Surprisingly thematic in feel.  The blackjack mechanic lends itself to the brinksmanship feel of the period, where two superpowers stared at each other across the Iron Curtain.

RATING: 7
This game is an improved, variable, slightly skilled version of Blackjack. It is amazingly portable, and easy to play in less than an hour, with almost no setup required. The theme is very strong. I was happy to play military abilities to kill off cards, business abilities to improve efficiency, the media to uncover who will provide influence, and gambling secret agents and points rather than $. I dropped my score to 7 after I lost due to my oppenent simply drawing better cards many, many times and there was nothing I could do.

Jul08:  This was just not a good game.  None of the decisions really seemed all that interesting.  When drawing the groups (playing blackjack), most of the moves seemed pretty obvious.  If my opponent had a good card, tap it down.  If I was securely in first, then just pass.  And beyond that, just draw the right cards.

Choosing an agent was kind of fun, but not nearly as fun as something like Citadels.  From there, you were left with just a whole lot of game phases and steps.  I've come to really dislike games that are almost all procedure and no open ended game play.

The theme's okay, but it's not really that tied to the mechanics.

Overall, I'd just say skip it.

RATING: 3
I guess my expectations were way off. This really isn't what I would call a "game". Even the designer admitted in a thread that this was supposed to be a luckfest guessing filler game where each player didn't have his physical hands burdened with game stuff so that they could eat, drink, smoke whatever they wanted while they played. I expect more from games that I spend money on. Bad.

Ideal Players: 2

Description: Secretly choose your spy, then compete to get the highest influence without going over the nation's stability rating.

Pro: Great press-your-luck dynamic and bluffing dynamic. Agent powers and group powers add depth, and make the game interesting. Well-balanced. Photographic art matches theme perfectly. Mechanics and theme go together well.

Con: Ultimately a straightforward game. Largely determined by random card draws. Some of the powers like the Assassin are good, but make the game slightly less fun for the target.

Cold War: CIA vs. KGP is a relatively simple 2-player card game. At the beginning of each turn an objective card (either a country or a event) is revealed and the players compete for it by drawing or activitating cards that represent political, financial, media or military groups. Every objective provides 5-20 victory points and the first player to reach 100 is the winner. What makes the game interesting is a role-choosing mechanism where each player also chooses an agent to pursue each objective. The theme is strong and fits well with the game mechanics.

This is a nice little abstract card game with a press your luck/black jack mechanism.  That said, they really went as far as they could with the thematic chrome in context.  It definitely made it a more enjoyable game for me.  I also like the addition of the agent cards.  They add an interesting twist of the general scoring mechanic.  As is usual in a Fantasy Flight production, the cards are top quality.

Impressive for a Silver Line game from FF.  They've improved the component quality, shrunk the box size, and included a fine card management game with an interesting theme.  This has a CCG feel without being a CCG.   It plays like a modified blackjack with special powers.

Initial rating: 6.0 (August 2013)

I was pleasantly surprised by this game, I didn’t have a high expectation but it is a fun game to play. For me it is a bit reminiscent of Campaign Manager, but Cold War is the superior game. For now I have only played with a friend´s copy that has a different edition that I have.

The game components are top notch, the (almost) useless KGB and CIA shields are awesome and look great. It has a good theme and the name/text of the cards convey it perfectly. I love the bluffing aspect and the way the designer include the blackjack, push your luck mechanic. It has some luck, but I feel (for now) that the best player will usually win, that is to say, the game has some meaningful and interesting decisions in it.

It is a light game, perhaps lighter than I generally like, but for now I want to play it again.

You add groups to try and control objectives.
But each group also has a power (steal or give
a group to/from the other player, discard a group,
peek at the next group on the deck).
Then you also play spies. They can kill other spys,
give you an additional objective, or one spy can
steal the objective if the other side is ahead.

RATING: 9.15
Elements of Citadels (secret role selection and guessing opponents roles), Black Jack (highest strength below a threshold wins), and Magic the Gathering (battles between cards that each have a strength and fall into a distinct category with certain powers: drawing: Media, tap/untap: Economy, destroy: military, control magic: Politics).

You almost always have to worry about the Master Spy, which would allow the opponent to reverse a win and take your victory for himself, which introduces an element of bluffing and mind games.  Did the opponent kill his own card to support his Master Spy, or is he just trying to open up more room to draw another card?

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10816/blackjack]Blackjack[/url] where the maximum number of cards that can be dealt and value to reach differ per round. Also each card dealt has one of four distinct abilities to influence dealing. The game has a bit of card counting, but that is overshadowed with a (push your) luck element. The same goes for bluffing and outguessing of secret agents. The five point goals give players an onetime usable benefit and are really annoying. These goals only let you get dealt one card; so luckiest draw gets the benefit. But even worse, in order to use the benefit you have to give up 5 points, increasing the game length. This brings me to the main complaint: this game can drag along for a long hour until finally someone scores 100 points. No matter the cold war theme, who wants to play Blackjack for that long?

Many people compare this mechanic to blackjack, which I can understand.  Sadly, the whole thing smacks of war.  The ability to draw better cards than your opponent is king in some of the lower stability objectives.  Love the Agent X mechanic, but some of the agents won't be used for an entire game.  Liked it for a while, but fell out of love really quickly.

Bears no resemblance at all to Twilight Struggle, the Cold War theme is pretty much pasted on, but I think it works and it is enjoyable facet of the game.  This is a quick bluffing type game with a huge amount of luck in the card draws, but still some room for clever play.  The different card limits for each objective make each round a little different, sometimes very constrictive and other times wide open.  It's also fun choosing which agent to use, though some seem much more useful than others.  I don't think I'd want to play this all the time, but when played occasionally it's a fun little game.

Nice interface at JSP for online play - recommended!

An exciting little filler-ish type game. Its easy to learn and although some parts are heavily luck-based, there is some room for clever play and bluffing. I'd also have preferred less Event Objectives, since one-card draws don't seem to allow much room to manuever.

Components are excellent and overdone. Honestly, who uses the Balance token?

Or will they play the Assassin and kill my Agent X?  This paves way to a total "Princess Bride" scenario!  Sure, there is a "Blackjack" type mechanic, but when combined with the special powers of the four different groups, it becomes a completely different game.  The compact package size makes it excellent for taking on travel and pulling out at a bar or a pizza place.  Highly recommended!

Unfortunately, the game didn't really click with us.  Although there were a lot of objective cards, they all played the same, so it didn't feel like a lot of variety.  Moreover, the battle mechanism felt like very, very, very random blackjack (and since the group cards were re-shuffled each turn, you couldn't even try counting cards).  There also didn't feel like a lot of interactivity either.  The decisions felt very obvious each turn, and the group card actions didn't feel like they added much.  Moreover, often there was nothing you could to do to win due to the random luck of the draw---your opponent may be closer to the target value, but all you can do is draw a card which makes you go bust.  Not so fun.

On top of that, the randomness made it very difficult to plan which role to use (and most of the roles felt rather bland except for the Spy).  Maybe this gets better with more plays, but we were turned off pretty quickly.

I never knew the cold war was so much fun (there was that bit with Hasselhoff singing on the wall towards the end though).  CIA vs KGB is a nice two player game which once players become accustomed to the tactics, tit-for-tat plays and tense stand offs, close outcomes become common.  Good fun.  Will purchase a copy for game evenings in the pub.

This one is alright.  As usual, the rules are a bit hard to trudge through, but the basic game idea is quite simple.  The most interest part is the "blackjack" structure of the influence battle which is the core game.  I also wish agent powers were more intuitive/useful/better thought out

My wife and I love the theme and mechanic, but we both agree that this should be a 30 minute game, not an hour-long trudge to get to 100 points.  So... reduce the points to win and/or add house rules to make the game a bit more complicated,... perhaps closer to Twilight Struggle lite?

A lot of game is packed into a small box!  This is a 2-player game that plays rapidly and doesn't have a lot of options.  Example - the biggest choice on your first turn is choosing one of six spies (who have a power associated with them).  After that, you either choose to draw a card, activate a played card (or event card you won in a previous round) or pass.

But the choices are tense, and there is quite a bit of cat and mouse going on here.  As the game gets familiar, I found I was able to really analyze my oppoonent's plays, and try to outplay them (even with the limited options I describe above).

This game is a gem - it will remain in my upstairs bookself, and hopefully get some play with Rachel.  It's high rating is attributed to:  good theme, easy gameplay, easy to teach, tense, rapid play.

rating based on one play.  Seemed pretty lucky to me, but fun to play those Agent X cards (not unlike citadels.)  I want to play it again, maybe we'll figure out more strategy and control...

UPDATE: Ok, raising to an "8" after more plays.  This one is quite a gem actually, after both players are familiar with the game.  It's really not that deep, you just have to be familiar with the Agents X and the options they offer.  Very fun to try and out-guess your opponents.  The funniest scenario is where you both think the other has Master Spy (and thus you're both trying to lose the current hand) when in the end, neither of you do.  Very fun!

Looks so good, really top-notch components - but what a disappointment in playing. We probably played something wrong (easy when one knows about the poor German rules), but I doubt it. Too much luck involved with card drawing - only at a few occasion some dynamic can be generated by drawing and playing cards - far too often the number of allowed cards is much too low for that.Only the effects of two agents seem worth playing (Analyst: whats the point of looking thru the first 3 cards anyway?)  Much too long for what it is.Sold 2008 Essen 2007

For some reason, I can't get the rules for this to stick in my head. I'm always referring back to the pamphlet and scratching my head. Maybe I just need someone else to explain it to me properly before I'll understand it. It shouldn't be hard, and probably isn't, but the gameplay so far doesn't fit its average rating here on BGG. It's a nothing game to me, and I feel it shouldn't be. I would dearly love to love this as the theme is perfect for me.

Decent for what it is. Imagine a variable form of Black Jack combined with the role selection of Meuterer / Verrater. It is a little on the pricey side since it's around 50 cards, three chips, and a couple of markers. Update: this may be a little early for an update, but this game can be really good with two players who know what they're doing.  It's pretty exciting (but I still think it should be around 12 USD and not 20 USD.It's easy to learn and easy to teach. Update: bumping it down to a 7 after an exceptionally long game (75 minutes) It's still pretty decent, but got a little dull as both master spies were dead. If this could fit consistently into the 30-45 minute range, it would go back up.Update: again, yes. This game can be really, really good. It looks like it plays in about 40-50 minutes with two experienced players.Final Update: Down half point. It's still just as good, but more of a social game now.

Update: at 6.5. Don't let that discourage you from getting the game. I've played it a dozen times or so and enjoyed it. I think I wore it out from over play.

There's nothing particular bad about this game other than I didn't think it was too fun.  There are certainly some interesting decisions to make, some bluffing and a pretty good theme considering the game's simplicity.  This may have made a good filler but it overstays it's welcome and feels more like war than blackjack (which it's partially based upon).  Also, it's hard to catch up if you get too far behind especially if you've lost some agents.

Black Jack meets the Cold War. It still surprises me how some simple mechanics, some well suited atmosphere and good quality components can make a gaming experience satisfying.

As an aside, when me and my friend Adrian were playing this game at a local gamestore, we had a bunch of M:TG kids hanging around us. One of them, who just came in, asked "What are they playing? Magic?" And a fellow kid answered "Cool guys don't play Magic!". Me and Adrian started laughing.

Fun, quick, easy to teach card game with a cold war theme. There is a lot more here than just simply trying to keep from going bust ala "blackjack". Several times I was able to look 2 or 3 draws into the future and set up a strategy for my opponent lose the objective, taking into account all of his possible card actions at the same time. Your opponent might just win simply by losing while using his Master Spy, a nasty suprise for a gloating "winner".

My expectations were high - but this one failed miserably. The only real choice in the game is which agent to choose - and that is a rock-paper-scissors-choice at best. The rest of the game is very obvious. I could play both sides myself, and all would go the same way. Not only is it obvious what I'm supposed to do every time, it's also obvious what my opponent will do. For the (very) little game there is here - it is far too long. Bad.

Pretty good little card game that captures a bit of Cold War flavor.

Received 5/12/09 from M'aider Mathtrade for Dragon's Gold.

Interesting game - a sort of spy-themed, push-your-luck blackjack with some bluffing and misdirection bolted on top. It took us a bit to wrap our head around how some of the cards were interacting, but it turns out to be an enjoyable little game, and a nice change-up from the typical two-player card games that are seeing the table.

Went three years without a play. Traded in a lot for Hammer of the Scots.

Great to play with someone you know well.  It's a little nasty and pretty random, for sure,  But it can't be totally random because I'm on a 4-game win-streak against my brother where I've been shutting him down.

Simple, easy card mechanics.  It's great for travel because of its size and ease of play.

That goes a long way in my household.

Very good card game recreating the struggle between the USA and USSR during the Cold War.  Clearly not as indepth as Twilight Stuggle--more of a Twilight Struggle-very-lite, but still captures the feel of key historical events, groups and regions at odds during the Cold War.  More importantly, it focused on these issues through the eyes of Black Ops, secret agents and covert operations.  The game play does a good job of capturing the double dealing and triple top secret nature of espionage, however, can be almost tedious at times.  If you have an itch for the Cold War, 2 or more hours to play and a need for a global perspective--play Twilight Struggle; otherwise if you have an hour or less--play Cold War: CIA vs. KGB.Personal Note:  Game #460 Owned and #600 Rated.

This should be a 7 or an 8, but there just doesn't seem to be that much meat on the bone here.  I think the Agent cards are a bit unbalanced and the Group cards aren't dynamic enough.

It's a game of hand management and bluffing.  The meat of the game is a blackjack-like mechanism of trying to approach a certain number without going over.  The 'factions' or cards themselves have different abilities.

Some randomness due to the luck of the card draw.

This plays strangely, in that the game changes a lot with experience. I'm loving it, and would probably never turn down a game. It might be situational that I'd offer to play it.
Update: Game becomes more fun as the bluffing aspect rears its head. The game is a truly great filler.

I played the Star Wars re-skin of this a few years back, but I've always been more partial to this theme. As a result, I did find myself enjoying this more. Especially since it is far more tense than the Star Wars version. You can actually lose your characters by busting, which gives you an incentive not to. At the same time, I still feel like this game plays on autopilot just a little too much. I think the theme alone might cause me to hang onto this, especially since I tend to like the Blackjack mechanism used in modern designs. Nothing extremely fun, but good enough for a longer filler.

In this two player card game, one player is the KGB and the other is the CIA. Each player has identical personalities (Director, deputy director, assassin, master spy, etc.) Each round, an objective worth VPs ranging from 5 to 20 is flipped up. Each player then secretly plays a personality for that battle. Players then flip cards out of the deck to determine the outcome of the battle. The deck has four suits, with numbers ranging from 1 to 6. Each of the suits has different abilities: tap or untap a card, discard a card, look at a card from the deck or move cards. When both players have passed, they reveal their personality and resovle the battle. The higher numbered cards wins, and the personality cards take effect. For instance, the master spy allows the lower numbered cards to win. 

There is a lot of double guessing and there is a lot of luck. Some battles are worth 5 VPs, but those are a 1 card, 1 flip battle. The director ability, when you win allows to draw an objective card ranging from 5 to 20, which is quite huge, for a game that only goes up to 100 pts. It's okay, but the double guessing aspect (for instance, did they play their master spy?) is not a real favourite mechanic of mine.

This could be just any most-points-wins card game, except your hidden choice of Agent X throws in an end-game twist that can throw the outcome into disarray.  This throws in the edge that makes this game a cracker!

Laden with the thematic chrome of era-evoking typewritten agent cards, gorgeously chosen black-and-white photography, and objectives that were as meaningful then as they are irrelevant now.

Although the game meshes perfectly into its theme, it is firstly a game.  It does nothing to educate or inform about the Cold War, simply evoking that era to produce a great experience.

RATING: 6.5
Basically, this is blackjack, with some rules thrown in that allow opponents to do some nasty things to affect card play and who wins. 

Although the 4-color rule book looks nice, has many illustrations, and seems to have a lot of information describing the rules, there are many ambiguities that left me searching BGG and the Fantasy Flight site for answers, which was very frustrating, especially for what's considered to be an easy "filler" game. 

However, after checking around and rewriting the rules into a simplified, more specific nutshell, by the 3rd time I played I felt I was playing the way the designer intended. 

That said, in playing with others, I've come to the reluctant conclusion that the game seems underdeveloped. In particular, many of the Objective cards have point totals and cards-played totals that force a hand to end too soon, so that players often feel that no sooner have they shuffled the deck than the next hand is over and they're already reshuffling the deck. 

Whereas once I finally got a handle on the rules I rated this a 7, after playing it with others and getting a lukewarm reception and some of the comments related above, I'm dropping my rating to a 6.5. I will say that the 'agent' cards can be played in such a way that they imbue some theme into the game. My sister, a true gamer, played this with me in July 2013 and wasn't impressed, rating it a "4". Purchased July 2010.

RATING: 6.6
This is a fantastic 2-player game like no other! We don't always play it...but when in the mood it is a refreshing change that is always most appreciated! The fresh game mechanic is awesome and the theme thrusts you into the world of intrigue, spys, and politics! Players choose their secret agent and an event card is drawn! Players must draw a card each turn but not go over the population limit! If a player passes the limit...civil disorder may occur...possibly killing his/her secret agent! But maybe that's what your country wanted to happen...he he! Careful selection of your secret agent could cause your opponent's secret agent to be assassinated or maybe a winning hand might become the losing hand! Luck of the cards is a factor...but not so much that the game would become out of balance...after all this is the world of spying...not without its element of luck! Strategic planning at its best!

Plays well with quick and simple mechanics that really work!  Gets right to the heart of game play - action and decision making.  Bluff and pressure are here as well as psychology.  Not a bunch of die rolling in hope for a lucky break. Quick and to the point, there is plenty of replayability, what more do you want except the same thing in a multi-player game.

Complicated rules for what turns out to be a pretty simple game. Each round starts with a Vizzini contest to choose your secret character which will provide advantage at end of round. One of these kills off the opponent's secret character, so should you play one that can't be killed but offers nothing or go for an advantage? After that, the contest is for a random country which earns VP's, says how many value cards (valued 1-6) you're allowed to have and what value you bust at. Take turns either drawing a value card blackjack style if you don't think you'll bust (busting also kills your secret character) or use a value card's written ability to switch cards around. Highest without busting wins. This draw 1, action 1 process is fairly straight forward and doesn't offer much, but can be more dramatic if there's potential for someone to have played the "loser is now a winner" secret ability and they're playing like they might have used it. Or are they bluffing? These kind of features thematically enliven what's otherwise a fairly dull and repetitive round and round process until someone's accrued 100 VPs. A closely fought match can be quite nerve-wracking and you play in the hope that this'll happen, but unfortunately the game doesn't seem to provide a consistently good experience, as lucky / unlucky breaks early on can slew the game to 1 player. Therefore a lottery game - sometimes good, sometimes dull.

Picked up at PrezCon 2013 auction.  Very promising two-player card game.

Based on one play: A mix of deduction and card driven actions. You choose an Agent or KGB and then play cards (semi randomly) and use those cards actions to have a score closest to the number indicated on the objective, without going over. Since both players play Agents, you must try and determine what the other has played and the play cards accordingly. Simple mechanics, but can be frustrating and cause you to double guess yourself.

In my first game, the spies took backstage as I got to grips with the mechanics involved in manipulating groups, which in itself is an interesting problem to solve: this part is like blackjack with a variable threshold and variable number of cards to achieve it, coupled with the cards allowing discarding, stealing/giving etc. Though Twilight Struggle has a more historically specific narrative, the group aspect is not without a story, though told simply and with archetypes such as the Mafia in Cuba paying off the militia, or the infantry seeing off the students etc.
In the second playing, the effects of the spies come to the fore and adds a psychological depth to the above proceedings. So in this regard Cold War feels more like espionage than in Twilight Struggle. In fact this game may well be my favourite release of this year. My only concern is mechanically it is a little bit lather and rinse and I feel that until you get used to the subtlies it is best to play first to 50 as to 100 makes it abit of a stretch.

Good game. Way more tactical than most of the card games. The fun aspect of that game is that you have no choice but to bluff one time or another. The rules are clear and easy to learn. The time play of the game can be modulate by the amount of point for victory. A normal game as 100 points and takes about 45 minutes. A 50 points game will take you about half of the time.

Bon jeu. Beaucoup plus tactique que la pluspart des jeux de cartes. Un des aspect plaisant de ce jeu est que vous n'avez pas le choix de bluffer à un moment ou au autre.

Two player Blackjack with cards that have special powers.

Incredibly light, strategically shallow, but very enjoyable to play! It's the perfect filler! For a game this light, it has the right amount of complexity. For example, on first appearance, I thought that every card would have a unique special power. Games like this move so slowly and are prone to the worst kind of analysis paralysis -- AP simply from reading cards. Fortunately, all cards of one suit have the same power.

I Actually kind of enjoyed this blackjack style game. The special powers for the group cards and the agents add an interesting twist. If this game was shorter, I would consider this one a pretty good 30 minute game. The problem is, it's fairly finicky, repetitive, and lucky for an hour long game. Not that it's bad, it's just there are some many other games I would rather play for that time frame. Plus the wife thinks this is one of the worst games she's played, so I don't see my self getting this one to the table anytime soon. Maybe I can play this one with the kids in a year or so.

This game is a hidden gem for me. The theme works well with all the guessing and risk-taking that goes along. It seems more random than it really is in my experience (but there are some times where bad luck can really ruin the round, or even the rest of the game).

I recommend playing to 50 points. When one of the players get a good lead ahead, it is rare to see the trailing player catch up (though I saw it happen sometimes). Playing to 50 points mitigate that factor.

It´s just a variant of the classic game called "Siete y media" ("Seven and a half" in Spanish; something like "Black Jack"...) but playing with USA, USSR, secret agents, countries, and the  tension of the nuclear war. My wife and I love it!! It´s easy to learn the rules, exciting, quick, and fun. And it´s also very, very cheap. A game for two players highly recommended!

When I heard this was basically head to head blackjack, I thought it might be kind of lame.  I was wrong.  I really enjoyed the blackjack / push your luck mechanic and Im already a fan of double think so guessing which 'agent' the opponent played is right up my alley.

Occasionally this game can feel like it's on auto pilot since there will be times your opponent draws so well, you have one option to pursue.

This would be a decent game if not for the *heavy* role of chance in deciding battles. 
I really like the bluffing mechanic. Unfortunately, the bluffing usually takes a backseat to the wild randomness and unpredictability of the combat system. Card play is too simplistic and too dependent on luck of the draw. 
Too bad, with a different card-combat system this one would really shine. A hand-management system involving a few held cards carried over multiple rounds would be ideal.

After our first play, I went from aprehensive to loving it. I was mostly wary of the blackjack comparison, but that doesn't do justice to the game. Both games have you draw cards toward a point limit - end of similarity. It's a lot simpler to play than the somewhat overwrought rules would suggest. We had lots of laughs and exciting push-your-luck situations with just enough weight in the few decisions you have to make on our first play and I'm hoping to grab this up sooner than later.

Close to 'Citadels' in playing style, but designed for two (and only two) players. Very fun, quite strategic (even if one nearly-dominant strategy becomes quickly apparent) and quite short with the ability to easily alter the time-span. A good all-round filler.

Fast paced bluffing card game.  This is the typical game in which saying that it is more than it seems is not just a [i]cliché[/i].  After reading the rules, you feel that it is a fraud, a variant of War, Black Jack, or both.  Then you look at the very few components, that make the little Silver Line box from Fantasy Flight Games look huge, and its unevocative artwork, and you are positive that it is a fraud.  Nevertheless, if despite all that you get to play the game, you'll feel amazed of the unimaginated deep, fun gameplay and card combinations.  Definitively, this is a game in which reading the rules is not enough to have a real idea of the game, which will discover itself after a couple of turns.

I'm really enjoying this one so far.  A great variable target blackjack variant with hidden roles and ways to manipulate your own cards and your opponents.  Excellent!

9/12 - game length has kept this from the table.  We've tried playing to less points, but in general it seems like someone tends to shoot ahead very quickly, and the last few points just drag on still...bottom line we just have better two player options.

RATING: 8
This game is so good. I enjoy games that derive from traditional card games like Rummy, Poker, or Spades, so it's not surprising I enjoyed this "Cold War Blackjack".

The powers of the cards were good, they were all very straightforward and for only being 4 different powers it was fun pulling off combos. I sort of feel the pink cards are weaker in that their power is too difficult to use effectively, however, when you can pull it off it's usually a blow out. This might sound like it self balances, but the 5/6 pink are so limited and often will bust you.

In this game you play several hands of blackjack, each for a contested zone worth some number of points and each with a card limit and a bust limit. You can play a card (off the top of a shared deck), activate a card, or pass. If both players pass in a row the round is over and you move on to scoring. Having a good setup and constantly passing to your opponent, watching them sweat, is so great.

If I had one complaint it might last too long. The box says 30-60 minutes. How can a game have such range when there's no scaling to account for? It definitely took us about an hour to finish this up and even in a first game, we didn't need to consult the rules often. The game as written just takes closer to an hour unless there's a considerable blowout. A blowout would be hard though because you play to 100 pts, and that I feel is the problem, however I think you can fix this by playing to somewhere between 75-85. I haven't figured what would be best given the point spread, but chopping about 20% of the game off feels like it'd play about right, for me anyway.

After one play, I can say that this game is a lot deeper than I thought it was going to be. It seems overly simplistic at first glance, but there is a depth of strategy going on. Managing your own card powers provides a lot of depth by itself. I am looking forward to getting some more plays under my belt and seeing if this one holds up after I "get used to it".

I was pretty excited about this game when I first heard about it. I picked it up on impulse a couple weeks ago, and was a little disappointed by the seeming lack of complexity and variety in the group cards.  Actually playing the game showed the complexity and variety is just spread out among the game elements (objectives, agents).  Also, the doublethinking and opportunities for bluff come out much stronger than you would think, and the theme succeeds well in this regard.  Overall, I quite enjoyed it.

[1 play] This did not play quickly in our learning game, but we enjoyed figuring it out and learning some subtle tactics. There is more here than first appears, and I am happy to own this for further exploration. My initial rating of 7 isn't likely to hold - it will either rise a bit or fall dramatically depending on the staying power of the game.

This game has a "take that" feel, but it fits the theme well.

Most recent play 4-11-08 with Garrett.

Tense and well-paced 2-player game. Each player has a similar set of agents and are trying to flip over cards (each with a special ability which can be tapped, magic style, for powers). First to win 100 points worth of objectives wins!

Secret Santa present -- thanks, "wintertime"!

As others have already noted, this is sort of "Black Jack: the Gathering." You have the numbers-add-up-to-target of blackjack combined with the tap-to-do-stuff and special enchantment-like powers (the agents) of Magic. The first game seemed kind of random, but I think that was just inexperience and poor bluffing skills. I normally don't like psychological games of out-bluffing your opponent, but this should play quickly enough and has enough other stuff going on that I think I'll like it more.

There's plenty of luck with the card draws, but the CIA and KGB cards add a nice twist and the powers of the various cards add some excitement.  I also like how you can cash in your victory point cards if you really need their help.  Fun if not taken too seriously.

Cold War: CIA vs. KGB, 5 plays, rating 7 
This two player game is all about luck, or is it? I have that feeling but on the other hand, all the five plays where losses to the same opponent who has played the game more. The main difference among us is that he has experience in Cold War: CIA vs. KGB and is perhaps a little bit brighter than I. On the other hand, when he takes a mission with the director he always draw an operation worth 15 or 20, and I usually draw a 5 or 10. Also of all operations worth 5 he won about 80%. If the luckfactor in those two components could be less, and the feeling of "topdecking" all the time during the operations could be even out with some real choices the game would be good.

RATING: 7
[FFG 07 edition] {Cold war; utility cards, bluffing} Cold War: CIA vs KGB is a thematic card game for couples. The core system is similar to Black Jack, in which players try to collect cards with sum nearest to a target.  However, CWCvK includes many function cards and features to add more tactical decision to players:  the agent cards allow players to plan for future rounds; the objective cards provides various kinds randomness; the group cards allow micromanagement in each hand, choosing the start player of a round, etc.

The rule is easy to understand and teach.  The cards are informative enough so that it is not necessary to refer to the rulebook often.  The rulebook is very clear and well formatted (thumb up).

Player interaction is quite strong, in which players can directly "hurt" a group combination of their opponent.  Luck can still determine the game; however, players can have various tactics to counter-balance bad luck.  However, the randomness is high enough that there can't be a sure-winner, which is a good sign; otherwise my wife won't play this game with me anymore. In all, it is a very good couple game - a good mix of luck and tactics. Worth owning!

The components are top class. Illustration of cards is rich. The tokens are cool!

This is a good try for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

This is a nice light two player game.  It's very luck heavy but there's also enough psychology involved that it's still fun to play and it's short enough that the heavy luck doesn't really hurt it.  It's very much like black jack except you can also use the abilities on the cards to affect the outcome.  (And if you think that playing to 100 points takes too long then you could always shorten the game by picking a smaller goal.)

Edit  4/8/12 - I don't know what I was thinking the first time I played this way back when.  This is a pretty awesome game.  Actually, you've got lots of mini games rolled into one.  I love the card interaction but wished there was more carry-over from round to round.  Winning certain countries should mean something more.  Still, it's pretty good, but not truly great.  Definitely worth $12 at the new price point.  DEFINITELY.

Very few actual choices for the players to make.  This is mostly a game of random chance and luck.  I find it utterly boring with no real sense of accomplishment when you do something good.

RATING: 5
Card drafting game that aspires to be far more sophisticated than it actually is. Players have to win objectives by revealing cards and in pontoon style not exceed the objective's total. The cards also double-up and provide powers such as being able to steal your opponent's cards, discard cards, look at cards in the deck etc. Once both players have passed the person whose total is closest to the objective's wins the hand. A further element to the game is introduce through the presence of agent cards that each player plays at the start of the hand. These also posses individual powers such as the player who hand't initially won the hand winning the hand, assassinating your opponent's agent, winning a further objective etc. Overall though this is a game that is greatly dependent on luck as you reveal cards that you have little control over. That's a shame because 'Cold War' had a lot of potential to be a really intriguing and tense game but it falls well short of that mark. It brings nothing new to this style of game and feels bereft of a few ideas that could have made this an innovative card game. A wasted opportunity.

RATING: 8.2
Good alternative to Twilight Struggle if you only have an hour. The different characters really get you invested in each conflict, and my only gripe is with the huge swings possible when two Directors face off over a single card conflict (up to 50 points on the random draw of a card, if there is a 20 point conflict on the bottom of the deck).

Good for what it is. The roles can be fun (assassin to winning if you lose). Sometimes it feels too luck-dependent (it really does depend on what cards you get), but there are always a few situations when making the most of what you have pulls you ahead.

I like this but my primary 2P partner (my wife) sadly doesn't. Hope to chalk some plays up somewhere along the line and confirm my view that I definitely like this game! It's got a couple of original mechanics, not terribly complicated, but I conceed that it might be viewed as dry...time will tell
Update: Played a couple of games with a gamer now - and we both loved it. Luck and tactics in equal measure I would say - and what a blast! Great fun :)
Update: Gone to 10 now as played it again and we just keep saying "One more game?!" Last session this was a closing final game but after 3 more plays and 2 a.m. approaching we had to reluctantly call it a night. Superb. Luck, tactics, push your luck and bluffing combine to make a fab fun game playable in c.40 minutes.

RATING: 7
This is an initial rating, and I suspect if it changes it will move upward. A the game has an element of double-think and second-guess that's entirely in keeping with the spy theme. Add in a streamlined design that allows room for some clever play, and CIA vs. KGB is definitely a game worth more than the tiny bit of shelf space it occupies!

Glorified blackjack for 2 players. The game is really easy to play and there are just a few tough decisions to be made in a typical game. Selecting an agent each round is about the most tactical decision made each round as there are not too many options during game play. Probably 70% luck. Fun way to spend 30 minutes.

Small and simple bluffing game with a proper theme added to it. There are new versions from FFG now (lacking cool poker chips as tokens for CIA and KGB) so if you like the theme and don't have enough time to enjoy Twillight Struggle this is fine option to choose. Plus it's really small and you can carry it with you everywhere.

Don't fully understand the Event objectives where you seem to be just relying on pulling the perfect card, nor do I understand why a player would use a Political group to deliberately cause civil unrest; the rulebook says this is "risky" but I don't see the upside.  That being said, the rest of it is pretty good fun.

The theme is very well incorporated into the game and the components enhance the theme even more. Really well done on that front.

If you enjoy press-your-luck games then you'd enjoy the black jack style mechanic in this one.

Update: I played this quite a bit recently and I really had a great time with it.  I hold the rating at a 7 because I am trying to be a little stricter on my ratings and I can see where the game might play itself out.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 4

RATING: 9
A lot of fun. A unique system where there's always a way to manage something. Chance is less important than the ability and intelligence of the player. I love it !!! It's all a matter of bluffs and twists !!! It's just a GREAT GAME. A long time I hadn't seen a game so enjoyable. It's very easy to understand and the fun comes immediately - max half an hour. For those who like it - and I am one of them - there's also a kind of 'role play' with the character you chose. Actually, you don't have a choice. You must play accordingly to the character you choose. I have never seen a game where, somtimes, you must look for defeat in order to win !! But beware ! It's maybe what your opponent wants you to think...As you may have understood, I'm addicted and I definitely recommend it to any twisted mind%u2026 It's cheap and allows hours and hours of fun !Unique I said...The only 'bad thing' I could say about this game is that it's only a 2 players game. I would love to find a game like this but for more players.

I like the theme and tension.  There are safe choices and bold choices, and both have their merits.  A player can manipulate her luck in a number of ways to drag a victory out of the ashes of misfortune.  This is yet another fantastic value from the Silver Line of games.

RATING: 5
Acquired in Aussie Math Trade May 2010. This is definitely blackjack with a few subtle twists that come from the selection of agent roles. Very random, complete lack of strategic options. Good if you want a light, random filler. Don't get this thinking you'll find the complexity of the cold war. 

**Gave this away as part of a surprise package in one of my October 2010 games for geekgold lotteries**

I personally think this is just a little bit of a let down.  It's not a bad game in the least and is a nice addition to my little 2 player game collection but it's not greatness either.  I think 100 points is a bit too long for this game too but that's just my opinion.

Hmmmmmm traded in a math trade as it never was seeing ANY table time.

World War II has left the world in upheaval, and many nations' futures are filled with uncertainty. The USA and the USSR are the only Superpowers who can lead the world toward a better future.

Cold War: CIA vs. KGB puts you in charge of a spy network during the post-war era. Your purpose: to "persuade" foreign governments to embrace the "proper" ideology, by any means necessary. Manipulate local factions of influence to get your coup d'etat up and running. Double-cross and eliminate your opponent's leaders. Gain prestige for your side by winning the Space Race, dominating the Olympic Games, or ensuring that one of your countrymen wins the Nobel Peace Prize.

In this decades-long conflict, victory will go to the side with the resources, conviction, and commitment necessary to ensure that their world view shapes the future.

RATING: 7
I may have been a bit disappointed when I initially saw Cold War, but color me pleased at this point; I'm glad to have a light card game with some bite to it. It brings the experience of Blackjack to the table in an easy going way, but allows tactical play with the group cards, and sneaky play with the agent cards. Tension is quick, but evident, and play will seesaw back and forth until the end of the game. Those looking for a card game with theme and some tactical play will love Cold War: CIA vs. KGB.  See my review for more details...

For a 'filler' the rules are not great, over simplified in some instances yet obtuse in others.
We've played 3 games and according to the rules threads we're still getting it wrong. I can see how some people may not bother to persevere and toss it.

However that aside we've enjoyed it so far and the components are very nice. It's not a deep game by any means. I'm not really a fan of bluffing/read your partner games, but the cardplay other than that of the agents is enjoyable enough. Infact we rather enjoy playing without the agent cards - heresy!

Two-player auction game with a cool Cold War theme. The theme shines through here with amusing situations, such as beautiful female KGB agents sending CIA agents on leave, allowing students and fundamentalists to take Cuba.

There's a lot of bluffing and tense play, but - sadly - with two immensely competitive and well-matched players, the game proved simultaneously too simple and too psychologically intense for the 'light small box' slot in our collection. It was competing with Mottainai, Red7, King of Siam, YINSH, Yomi and a bunch of casual games like Patchwork.

We played once to 50 points and never again.

This is a neat concept, and if it played much longer than it did, it would probably aggravate the hell out of me.  As it is, there's some amount of strategy and second-guessing, not just with the hidden roles, but also in the way that you manage your cards, even though the cards are drawn completely randomly.  Card counters might be at an advantage here, if they can recall how many of each type of card has been played.  Also, this is one pimped-out produced game, with some sweet chips and nicely produced cards, for a Chinese production.  I'm looking forward to playing again.

The Cold War is heating up and the first to 100 points wins.  Each turn features an objective that represents a country or an event to quarrel over, each objective providing the victor with a varying bounty of VP.  Each side assigns an agent to the task.  Fight/maneuver your way to victory by calling on military, media, economic, and political allies by playing cards (each objective has a card limit) to get as close to the objective's goal value without going bust (blackjack style).  But not all victories are victories if the enemy has the right agent.  Lot's of bluffing and reverse psychology.

Great components (esp. the poker chips, which are just ridiculously cool).  Game seems way too symmetrical for my liking.

Played once. A nice two-player game with some interesting rules, good components and a rather convincing theme (although it might have been interesting to have some asymmetry between the players). It might be a bit long (at least, my single play was, but it was a learning game - and I suppose you could always play to 80 points instead of 100), and the lack of control on 5-pt events is a bit annoying, but overall the game is a pleasant plays quite nicely.

Heavy luck factor has soured my opinion of this a bit.

Surprisingly good 2 player game in a little package. Great for lovers of black jack, and bluffing.

Play 3 turns get stuck in civil disorder with no way to untap or draw new cards.  Rulebook should say play only 3 turns instead of following it up with a bunch of fails neither player can do anything about.

This is really my style of game. First the theme is a great match to the gameplay and the graphic design is very good with lots of cool Cold War photos used throughout.

The gameplay is all about bluffing, double-bluffing, keeping a poker face, deduction, and of course meta-gaming. See why I think this works perfectly with the CIA vs KGB theme?

The game is rather snappy, and easily finished in under 60 minutes, but games can vary from being very close and therefore closer to 60 minutes, to landslides victories if things go horribly wrong for one player, and then games can be over much faster.

Un divertidísimo y poco valorado juego de cartas para 2 jugadores. Uno toma el control del KGB y el otro el de la CIA, asumiendo diferentes roles secretos en cada lucha por la influencia en los diferentes países del juego. A destacar el papel del Maestro de Espías, auténtica estrella del juego. Muy recomendable.

A clever blackjack type game for 2 players. It's nicely balanced and there is enough going on for a challenging game. The Cold War theme doesn't resonate with me very much, but it's well implemented.

Very good bluffing game.  Don't listen to the ninnies who don't get it and think it's too ramdom.  It's not.

Un juego rápido para dos jugadores. Un poco de bluff, mucho azar, pero es entretenido.

Weird game, feels considerably unthematic. Nice bits and I actually like the game mechanics. Rated as an abstract card game.

Preliminary impressions: Blackjack with special powers on the cards.

It's alright, but tends to result in run-away leaders and isn't really all that engaging.

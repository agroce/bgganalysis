Had to pay a pretty penny to get this off an auction site, but glad I did. For me, it's two games in one. The first part just trying to get the commandos off the boats before they get massacred. The second is my favorite. Directing through town and trying to blow up as many targets as you can and doing everything you can to gather points, hoping the ever increasing amount of German troops start amassing away from your commandos. Really glad I have this in my collection.

This is an interesting game but it takes a while to get into it and I never felt dragged into it. Yet, for those who like solitaire games designed as such this is by far one of the most sophisticated in my opinion. Also the scenario was not very appealing to me.

I did enjoy this game.  Proper solitaire mechanisms.  Nice graphics.  Crazy swings of fortune from one side to the other.  Tough to win; given the high level of luck involved not a game you can play, work out how to beat the game mechanism and get tired of.  I've had smashing British wins, total disasters and everything in between.

If you don't like lots of dice rolling and luck being very important then this is not for you.  But as on the actual raid luck (good and bad for the British) was a reall factor then I think this recreates the feel of the raid itself.

My copy got lost due to a water leak - but thanks to the magic of Vassel I'm all set to venture up the river Loire again.

A really fun and tense tactical solitaire wargame.

I've read a good book about the british commando assault on the french port of St. Nazaire in WWII, and the game mechanics really captures the terrible hazards that those poor fellows experienced in real life.

It's an old design but a truly remarkable one, where the german "A.I." works beautifully.

The first portion of the game, when the commandos are trying to land their motor launches somewhere in the port is more bureaucracy and record keeping than tactical decision making, but the portion of the land combats and the attempts to blow up the predetermined targets with the soldiers that weren't blown out of the water is just pure fun.

The design offers inumerous options on how to use your demolition teams and the commando squads assigned to protect them from the german infantry that will start to swarm to the landing points.

Loads of adrenaline and fun in a system that really puts you in charge of things (and not just enjoyng a dice fest fun ride) and where the enemy "A.I." works intelligently to try to screw your plans.

And the map of the urban areas around the port is just gorgeous. 

This is a little pearl in my collection.

I just wished the first portion of the game wasn't so long and without any relevant decisions for you to make. The second part of the game is definitely the "meat" of this system.

Interesting situation but the rule book is badly organised and I gave up a few games because I missed some essential rules. It's only once I watched the fantastic videos on BGG that I fully understood how to play properly.
The turns are divided in two phases : naval and land actions. It has to be said that the naval phase is disproportionately long, considering that the player simply rolls lots of dice to administer the hits on his boats. The land phase however, which is when the player can rally make decisions, is rather quick in comparison.

Played 2.5 games so far, and the first few times the system bogs down as you learn what you are doing.  Later turns and games you start to see the nuances to the system and the strategies.

I found it to be fun once or twice. Does a great job of supplementing the various histories of the raid, one of my prime movitivations in wargaming. The game engine itself works well, things happen for apparent good reasons and thus it also does well in the "immersive" category. 

The reason I probably won't go back to much though is there really did not seem a lot of need for the human player. Granted, there are plenty of decision points, but the optimum decision at any given point seemed pretty obvious. I don't remember a lot of knuckle biting wrestling with my options.

Excellent game. Absolutely wonderful and fun. The only reason this game is not rated a 10 is because the rules are very tough to get through the first 2 or 3 turns. After that, you only need to reference the rules every so often it becomes so intuitive. Though the boat landing is not as exciting as the actual assault on land I found it very intense and stressful. When I finally got the troops to shore I was ready to kick some german butt! I will play this through again and write up a session report as soon as I can. Other great solitaire games: B-17 and Carrier.

Played this again recently, a real blast from the past. I think I would have enjoyed this quite a bit back in high school or college, but today, it's a bit of a time sink. I think it has really good bits: the run-in is very B-17-esque in that you don't have much (any) control but it's a great story generator as you dodge incoming fire (or not). Then as the commandos get ashore it's a race against time to blow stuff up and make the best with whatever survived. All good. But there is just too much other stuff. Once the commandos are ashore and the boats are loitering to try to pick up survivors or evacuate raiders, the shore fire routine is insanely tedious, cross-referencing boat IDs and figuring out who is closest to the die roll. Putting out tons of german units, few of which are likely to see action, and tracking down their zones is a bit of a chore. And when you start trying to figure out what you need to do to win, it basically comes down to a couple high-stakes die rolls: the biggest single VP award is the single die roll for the Campeltown.

I played this after recently playing Operation Chariot, the ASL take on the raid. This is a great topic for a solitaire game, and Raid almost gets it right, but not quite. It needed to be shrunk down so that (for example) the U-Boat pens, which it is a virtual impossibility the commandos will reach, could have been omitted. Also, the limited flexibility in planning your approach - there only two areas you can land at even in the free-planning version - seems like a huge and needless limitation.

Anyway, I enjoyed playing it once, but it's too much time and too much wristage for too little payoff for me, I think.

It does have much better Searchlight rules than Operation Chariot, though.

RATING: 6.5
There frankly is almost no decision-making in the landing (boat) phase.  You just roll dice and watch your precious boats catch fire and sink. You're probably better off ignoring the default landing sites.  Once your surviving troops are on the board, there is some strategy to consider....and still the ever-frustrating roll of the die.  I think the cruelest thing about this game is that even if your guys survive the fiery boatride in, get to their objectives safely and then successfully demolish whatever-it-is....they still will most likely get wiped out.  Its very difficult to get guys off the map safely.  Its nigh impossible to sail away.  Its extremely difficult to escape on foot. So if you have any sentimental attachment..it hurts.  Much more brutal than Ambush!.  

I enjoy RoSN quite a bit, but its cruel. In the end it feels like you're doing a lot more than you really are (in terms of choosing your fate). Mostly you're just hoping for some good luck.  I recommend playing it...but don't expect to have a large variety of strategic approaches.  The variety comes from a six-sided demon.

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome candidate. Immense amounts of die-rolling as your raiders ply into St.N and take loads and loads of Axis fire right on the chin. I wish this part of the game was speedier, as it really is more of a preamble to the real action--doing the best with what you have in a dastardly situation. I will give that portion of the game points for evoking a sense of narrative and atmosphere, though. Again, I just wish it wasn't so labor-intensive.

Once on the ground, your boys have to move fast before the Germans wake up to what's happening. Just don't get too attached to any particular unit--they're marked men and face tremendous odds against getting out in one piece.

This is one for the solitaire gamer who enjoys a wargaming experience, as opposed to one who's heavily focused on winning. Suits me just fine, and I play it every few months for a few laughs.

Better spend your time with a game of Civilization III on the computer. Would probably make a good computer game, though.

This is the only solitaire game I have ever played that feels like I'm playing a highly competitive 2-player game with a very sharp opponent. Believe me, there will be times where you will toss the dice and then be afraid to look at the results! It is also one of the few solo games that will make you think, in those odd moments, of varying strategies ... which means there is good replay value here too.

The odds are stacked against you, of course, but this *is* a solitaire game and what is the fun of beating a weak AI? Lots of folks seem to take exception to the brutal boat landing phase where your boats (and men) are sliced to ribbons. This is, however, quite accurate in terms of historicity and makes the demolition phase that follows a real nail-biter. 

Top notch components (a gorgeous map by Charlie Kibler) round out a beautiful package. Only letdowns are the typical AH rules, which take a couple of read-throughs to figure out what you are supposed to do. There aren't any designer's notes, either, and had AH thought to include those (where you'd get an explanation as to why you are *supposed* to lose a lot of boats) I think this game would have done even better than it did. Well worth your time to find a good copy on eBay!

This is a solitaire game simulating Operation Chariot – a commando mission on the port of St. Nazaire (France). The first couple of turns are a slaughter for the British, so much in boats as well as in men. Once troops are ashore the clock is ticking in favor of the Germans. You must hurry to achieve as much damage as possible with what you have left in your hands. The game plays well against you. The rules are fine but since this is not a typical wargame one has to re-read several times rule sections to comprehend how things work out on this unusual battlefield: night time, sea zones, AI reaction, boats, commando raid, artillery, Flak towers, searchlights, torpedo attacks, demolition charges, U-boat pens and German naval troops. The map is filled with areas and not hexes like in most wargames; something which helps the AI of the game to react like a real opponent. The alternative map and counters found in BGG are far better than the actual ones – recommended. Also, the game has lots of variants in order to find out what-if situations. Once you get the feeling of the mechanics of the game, things flow smoothly and tensely. A fine commando wargame.

Very good solitaire play. The game gives also a very authentic impression, due to the nice graphics of the map that give you the impression that you're actually there. Very realistic but a bit against my nature is that to win you must rate the completion of objectives higher than the lifes of your men. The safe homecoming of a survivor will not give you much points, but a successful demolition will.

This is nearly as good as my favorite game Ambush! It is a pinnacle of game design and it is as fresh today as it was released back in 1987. From the dice system of triads to every other single mechanism it just works excellently. Although the system is novel, the rule book is crisp clear and explains everything fine (although the organization is a bit problematic). And boy is it fun to play this game. The downside is it is brutally hard.

RATING: 10
Excellent solo simulation of the raid.  Captures all the drama of the raid, from the naval portion, in which your boats are at the mercy of fate as they try to land the Commandos amidst a seemingly endless hail of German coastal gun fire, to the tactical race of the land portion, in which your Commandos outmanuver and outfirepower the German shore personel, trying to reach and demolish their objectives before they are overwhelmed by constantly increasing German reinforcements.  A unique, creative, and playable solitaitre experience.  

Can be a bit dice heavy, especially in the naval portion, but that's only true during the first couple turns, when the British boats would have been fairly helpless anyway... seems appopriate.  

When your Commandos are in the boats they are at the mercy of the German searchlights/guns.  Once they land, that changes, and the level of control you exert on the situation becomes quite high.  It's all about your tactics at that point, and how you act proactively and also react to the German reinforcements that appear each turn to thwart you.

Excellent narrative, excellent feel for the situation (you really feel the drama and intensity), and the perfect amount of player decision-making.  I'm surprised that the system hasn't been adopted for other campaigns (Dieppe seems like a no-brainer, and even one of the D-Day beaches would be workable, as well as any number of PTO landings...)  Great fodder here for a burgeoning desinger...

Along with Ambush and RAF, this game completes the perfect trilogy of old-timer grognard solo wargames for me.  Perfect 10.  Always challenging, and I can play it again and again and have yet to tire of it after over 3 decades of semi-regular play (dozens upon dozens of games).

An excellent example of the paper time machine.  First, though I rarely care about the bits, I still remember unfolding the beautifully detailed mounted mapboard.  Each of my games usually goes the same way: half the fleet get blown out of water; the lucky commandos make it ashore and start sweeping aside the first few Germans to react; some demolition squads start blowing up targeted buildings; my commandos make it just short of blowing the bridges connecting the old town from northwest in the face of growing German resistance and gun towers; the increasing desperate commandos try to finish the job while getting pressed in from every side.  Sometimes a handful of squads escape, sometimes my commandos die to the man.  An exciting ride throughout.

Well played for the first time.  Lots of people say that there is to much die rolling for this game .  Well yes but that's part of the fun and the suspense.  Got a score of 75 VP and lost lots of boats on the way out.  Was luckier on the way in.

Really liked it

once you get into the game, i.e you get troops landed it's great fun. its' tense you`re trying to hold off the germans with your assault commandos while your demolition guys blow the targets and then, when there are swarms of germans coming after you, you want to cut them off by blowing the bridges. the only let down of this game is the overly long and complex affair of getting your ships landed.  frustrating and boring Unnecessary dice rolling. hence the lower rating.  but if your into playing with yourself, this is the game for you.

This game has some potential, but it really, really needs better rules and faster play.  The rules are laid out very poorly, are not intuitive, and have huge, glaring holes in them.

Great solo game!  I have been playing board games since the 70s and this is one of the best solo games I have seen with fantastic replay value.

I have now logged over a half dozen games of this and I am increasing my score to a "9".  I have yet to see a "10" for solo games so maybe I am still being too harsh.

Components are fantastic if you can find a copy or get it on VASSAL (for free) and play!

Bought November 2010. I'm so pleased to get a copy of this one. I have read so much about it on BGG and as I am really into solitare game systems this was a must buy. Passed on a copy I saw at a Toy fair in Shepton Mallet a while back. Stall holder only wanted £10 for it but I just could not be sure that it would be complete. Flash forward about three years and I end up buying a copy from Ebay at £45!!!  It is unpunched and in really great condition. This game better be good is all I can say. 

Well it is no longer unpunched and it is as good as everyone says. Really enjoying playing this now!

Another great solo game.  If only I was into solo games!  The board is stunning in it's detail.  The first major problem I have with the game is the initial approach.  It can be devastating, which is quite historically accurate.  However the game can pretty much end before the landing parties ever hit.  It's difficult to manage which ships are hit and which can still move and fire. There is a lot, and I mean A LOT, of dice rolling.  And then most ships can sink prior to landing making any further progress in the game futile.  It is a difficult game and it got old having to restart over and set everything back up.  It can get old.  The AI is quite good though and if you can land enough ships the land movement and battles can be quite interesting.  I can understand the popularity of this game amount war and solo gamers.  It has a stunning board, it is rich in history and theme, and the AI is very good.

It takes quite a bit of time to play and there certainly is a lot of die rolling involved, especially in the beginning. But the map is great, the gameplay is tense and the narrative of the game is exceptional. I'm very happy that I managed to snag a copy.

For me, solitaire games are often less fun than two-player wargames played solitaire.  A LOT of dice rolling in this one and some fiddliness (e.g. the searchlight mechanism).  More importantly, the game can be frustrating as your squads can be simply wiped out by a bad set of rolls regardless of what strategy you use.

This was a hard game to rate for me.  I only played it once.  I found it frustrating to play, and at times not all that enjoyable, but in the end, very tense and exciting.  Makes no sense, I know.  The rules were dense, but an article downloaded from grognard.com helped immensely.  And the historical article (also downloadable) is an exciting read.  Toward the end of the game I was identifying with the few remaining commando teams, which I suppose is the sign of a successful design.  And the map is beautiful.  But there's an awful lot of dice rolling.  Can't quite put my thumb on why I wasn't thrilled with the game.

RATING: 3
This is a brilliantly designed, beautiful looking, thematically amazing, historically accurate and interesting simulation that I can't see myself ever trying again.

During my first and only game, I conceded to zee Germans after an hour of setup and three hours of play (4 turns). I was down to about 40 minutes per turn, but that still looked like another 3-4 hours to see the game through to completion. I made mistakes in, I suspect, nearly every phase of every turn. Continuing the game felt like masochism, not fun, so I called it. It's possible, but very unlikely, that finishing would have changed my rating.

I knew this game was outside my solitaire comfort zone, which has only just expanded to include things like Labyrinth (itself far enough from my sweet spot that I don't see it getting played often due to length), but I didn't realize just how far outside it was. It's full of exceptions, special cases, modifiers to just about everything, conditional cases, and so many other moving parts that every turn felt like a slog. The story that was emerging was interesting, and I wanted to see how it turned out, but not badly enough to play what likely would have been an eight-hour game.

It's wholly undeserving of a 3 in terms of its quality, but earns it for me because I have close to zero interest in playing it again.

OId school solo game with a brutal naval segment - both process wise and casualty wise. Once ashore you can practically feel the bullets wiz by as you rush to do as much damage as possible before being engulfed by more and more Germans.

There is a lot to like here, but it takes a long time and you roll a whole lot of dice. I can´t help thinking that a computer could show me what areas are illuminated this turn and what happened to my boats and let me focus on the decisions. I can see the enjoyable agony in seeing what happens to your boats, but it just takes too long to find out. Perhaps, one day, when I can keep the game set up and play a turn each night.Til then, give me Reichstag - a solo board game for the modern man - or give me Napoleon Total War. Btw, the map is absolutely great, but a map does not a great game make.

The first part of the game is partially on autopilot as you try to get your landing craft to shore safely.

The real fun begins once you hit the shore and wreak havoc on the German placements.

Quite a good and tense solitaire game, especially when the defending troops start arriving en masse.  Pretty slow to start with LOTS of defensive fire rolls.  Took me a while to get started, and had to check the rules quite a bit at the beginning: quite a few exceptions to the rules at specific times.  Some tough decisions, and pretty deadly.  I scored abnormally high, but think I messed up some rules.  One of the better solos I've tried.  Thanks for letting me borrow it, Jeroen!

Of all the solitaire games I've played (Fields of Fire, Ambush, B17) this is the best. The game consists of the British flotilla running the gauntlet of German harbour fire and landing commandos. The commandos then have to destroy key features whilst fighting off randomly generated German forces. There is lots of dice rolling (which is Ok by me) but the 'story' the game tells is absolutely compelling and thrilling. Searchlight beams seek out boats, commandos knock out key targets with grenades and demolition charges, torpedoes blow up lock gates, boats set on fire, explode and sink; and the Campbeltown packed with high explosives and carrying 6 sections of Commandos chugs towards the Southern Caisson. really, really good game!

RATING: 7
Played many years ago, but I remember this being one of the better, if not best, of the solitaire wargames.  As British commandos, your first task is to survive the initial assault by boat.  If the Germans (controlled by the game system) spot you with their searchlights, all hell breaks loose.  The surviving commando teams then land and scurry off into the night to complete thier objectives as the German security forces grow in numbers as they respond to the threat.  The amazing map art helps convey the feeling of a night raid.  Good stuff.  Update: played again in 2011 and it still holds up as a solid solitaire wargame.

No need to play if you are looking for a stunning British victory!  But victory is possible - along with heavy losses and some agonizing turns watching the Royal Navy get hammered.

The rules seem a bit "heavy" at first, but actually plays pretty well once you get into the cycle (there is an article on Grognard.com that really helps).  And once the naval portion of the game ends, gameplay moves faster as the commandos and Germans fight across the port.

RATING: 9
An excellent solitaire game that is not overly complicated, with a very good, challenging AI. There are two parts to the game: the water approach, which is very punishing to the commandos as there is little you can do to fight back and gets tedious, but you are then rewarded by the nail-biting ground assault where the commandos kick-ass until they start having to retreat to a build-up of increasingly organized defenders as the Germans begin to organize a counteroffensive. Would be better if water assault portion were simplified and streamlined. Ground assault is a gem of solitaire play.

RATING: 7
A lot of things depend on the Campbell. If the Campbell can't strike the Harbour, it is better to play again a new game.
It is a pity to wait few turns to see that you have to start a new scenario. But if the Campbell succeed, game is very interesting and feels like ASL.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of my all-time favourite games. The actual WWII Allied commando raid it depicts is a bit of a pet subject of mine and the mechanics of the game manage to convey (to my mind) the tactical goals, confusion, improvisation and the growing German threat in such a way that each game feels like a true re-telling of the raid, whatever the outcome.

The importance of the HMS Campbeltown ramming the dock caisson is so important to the success of the mission that it seems pointless continuing to play if the ship's destroyed before able to do so. Luckily, this happens early enough in the game to start again without too much bother.

Alors mes impressions sur ce jeu :
• les points forts :
 
- le thème original (pour ceux qui aiment…)
- le graphisme de la carte (celui de la boite également.. : ça bouge, c’est nuit, il va y avoir du danger… : ça donne envie de jouer non… ?)
- le système n’est pas très compliqué
- un mélange de phase navale/phase terrestre 
- une gestion des actions par le système qui est bien vue (mouvements allemands, cibles prioritaires…)
- beaucoup de décisions sont à prendre :
*après les débarquements : place des vedettes, rapatriements…
* après les destructions de cibles initiales : objectifs à détruire, fuite, destruction de stosstrupp….
- la possibilité de faire son propre plan
- les retournements de situation sont nombreux (on pense poser une charge tranquillement… : des troupes arrivent…, la détonation ne se fait pas… arrrggghhhh
- Bref : il y a du suspens !

• les points faibles :
 
- bien que le système de jeu ne soit pas très compliqué, la règle, dans sa présentation est à mon avis le point faible du jeu. L’index est incomplet (à chaque fois que j’ai cherché une aide… rien !)
(exemple : « OUT of ACTION », « DAMAGE »… rien… : il faut aller fouiller… et on a des bribes d’info. ici et là !)… c’est un peu pénible
- le manque de marqueurs (pour montrer des objectifs détruits, des objectifs à atteindre…)

- plus embêtant :le début du scénario proposé par le jeu est trop directif (les points de débarquements sont fixés, les commandos ont leurs objectifs, les places dans les différentes vedettes sont déjà attribuées. On s’en prend plein la tête (ça devient intéressant à partir du moment ou des hommes ont pied à terre)
- 2° gros point faible : le manque de scénarios ! (on pourrait imaginer des scénarios « post-débarquement »…)

A candidate for best solitaire game ever.  Not my favorite but pretty close.  If I remember correctly, the rule book was a bit of a problem but maybe it was fixed.  Has the feel of an action movie without being unrealistic.

Two problems with the game. The opening few turns are just rolling the dice and taking casualties without much decision making. There's about a 1/3rd to 1/4 chance the game will be over by turn 3, but not before spending 3 or 4 hours of setup and rolling 100s of times and marking off dead Brits, a masochist task. Problem two: the game is designed to kill off the Brits nearly 100%, even though it's somewhat realistic, it is entirely no fun to watch the heroes go down. Big time sink. Clever design with the 3 dice system.

Very goos salitaire experience.  Essentially you roll dice to see how many times you ship gets hit and how many guards are activated, but eventually it will always  be too many.

Brutal game with a gorgeous map board. Seems like a victory simply for the commandos to make it off the boats! Tough but marvelous fun. One of my all time favorites despite being slaughtered most of the time.

I feel that RSN shines in two areas; It
has strong replay value, and the compon-
ents are tremendous.  In some games, the
British are cut to pieces before they
land.  When the Brits land mostly in-
Gtact, they can usually do well, as the
Germans are slow to react.  From my own
reading about the actual raid, this does
seem to be a good simulation.  I do feel
the the rulebook could be much better.

It is a game I have to be in the right mood to play. There are things I like about it(blowing things up, commando actions) but there are things I dislike very much. This is the harbor and dock defensive fire, it makes the game drag. It is a struggle for me to go through all the dice rolls in those phases. I wish there was a quicker way to do it. I feel it is an exciting game to play to see how well one can do. Since I am older now the counters are a struggle to read. It would be nice to see a remake of it with bigger counters and to speed up the harbor & dockside fire. However, it is an excellent solitaire game and would recommend it to gamers who enjoy them.

One of my first solo games, got it as a kid and have just hung onto it all these years. This is a good strong challenge when I have several hours to myself. Strong AI and still one of the most beautiful map boards of any war game. Those that have gamed like I have should have this on the shelf.

A fun little game. The opening can be tedious - lots of boats being shot, lots of die rolling. Once the crews land it's a whole different game - tense and exciting.
It's got an advantage over its cousin "Mosby's Raiders" in that the player has many units to control, instead of one. 
Good game.

Raid on St. Nazaire felt like more of a combat simulation apparatus than a board game and often, this thing was a clerical foray of dice accounting.
So the comments by other players about the tedious, near endless dice rolling for the water attacks are not overstated: I had one turn that lasted twelve rounds in the Harbor and (one of the) Dockside attack phases. So that's 24 rolls (of 3 dice) to hit, plus other guns fired in the Dockside phase (about 6 of those). Each of these 30 attacks against me required 3 dice to track (so that's now 90 dice rolled), then two dice to determine the severity/type of hit (now we're up to about 150 dice rolled), then often another roll to determine the number of crew or commando strength or weaponry lost. So if possibly rolling 175+ dice against yourself in a single part of a 17 step turn sounds fun, Raid on St. Nazaire was designed for you.

For those of us who are not clerical robots, the boat oriented phase of this game may prove very time consuming and often tedious. I spent more time looking at paper and dice and the dense, badly laid out rulebook than at the actual board or characters.

Once the titular land raid commences, things get more interesting very quickly and certainly there is a sense of accomplishment at this stage because so many ships have been sunk and so many injuries and deaths have occurred. A lot of the landings and targets (read: choices) are determined ahead of time by history/this system, which also adds to the feel of this being a simulation.

The activation and placement mechanisms of the Germans troops are well done, as are the linear movement rule system and the requirements for a proper English bombing. Still...these latter positives cannot wholly overbalance the tedious first portion, but the game does have some pluses if you survive the dice rolling tsunami that it takes to get there.

I can see playing this simulation again once or twice, but not often, though it is a memorable clerical undertaking that occasionally resembles a "game" and possibly influenced the development of great, modern solitaire wargames like D-Day at Omaha Beach.

I met Brig. Peter Young when I was a teenager (after joining the SK) - an amazing character. On those memories alone, this game may even go higher to '1 - must have'. I remember him saying to many of us "never go soldiering with miserable b***ards - or teetotallers!"

Got half of my fleet destroyed before even coming near to St.Nazaire, but still it was exciting to see how many of my men would survive. Quit playing after two rounds, because I discovered I misinterpreted some rules wrong. No problem, on to the next time.
Played for the second time, and found out I forgot most rules. So it took two hours before the english were about to land. This is where the game paused, and I hope to continue today. (Feb.2008)

After years of no-play I decided to sell it. I hope the current owner gives this game the attention it deserves. I was not worthy... (Jan.2013)

Another excellent and rich solo experience - one of the top 10 solo games available to war gamers - a must for those who game WWII.  Overall a very interesting game based on a very interesting event in WWII. The first part of the game can drag a bit though as you roll and roll and roll for the german shore batteries plasting your boats.

Feb 2017 - Finally got to play this.  It's an interesting quick abstract.  works well on a lazy susan.  It looks great and the play is good.  It takes some work to try and set up the win.  Try to leave no options for your opponent.

I didn't think that Axiom was nearly as much of a brain burner as I expected from others' comments. It does take a few moments to grok the scepter movement possibilities -- diagonally in a plane or over any number of edges in one orthogonal direction. The game is more tactical than strategic, and one of the best tactical plans is to try to minimize your opponent's movement choices.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Beautiful looking, but as most abstracts tend to be, very dry and boring.  I enjoyed watching the sculpture morph as the game progressed, but other than that found it to be pretty ho-hum.

I own a copy just as a cool sculptural piece to display in my game room.

Really cool.  An interesting and unique abstract game.  Truly 3-D, not just a board with different elevations.  A real thinker. Plus it’s fairly compact, transportable and doesn’t take a whole lot of room to play.

While not my favorite abstract, Axiom is my favorite HARD abstract.  It's an excellent game, but not something I'd pull out with just anyone.  Still, this scratches the itch when my brain is screaming "HURT ME, HURT ME!"

An interesting concept and an exercise in spatial recognition, but I don't think the game itself is all that interesting.  Either that, or my brain just can't wrap up all those 3D possibilities, so that the game leaves me a little bit flat after the initial excitement.

It's difficult to design a 3D abstract, mostly because it must be simple enough not to be overwhelming. Well, Axiom succeeds quite well. The gorgeous components also take the game a step further. Not sure you can figure out a strategy, but it's filled with tactical challenges.

OMG brain burner! At the moment I'm thinking this is one of those games that's so complex that you can't get your head around it, so then the person who makes the last mistake wins. Having played twice, I think I'm in love.

RATING: 7
Highly original and outrageously cool-looking abstract that is just so damn  unusual that no other game&#039;s strategy you may have acquired will help you here. I certainly need to play it a lot more times before I get past the stage where you make pretty arbitrary moves in the hope that your opponent makes the first mistake, leaving you one move from victory. The rules supplied are fairly minimal and unclear on certain points, including how the playing area may be rejoined if the cubes become divided into 2 or more separate areas.

After barely 1 play.  Preliminary rating (I feel it has a bigger chance to stand/fall down than the opposite).

Interesting game.  Cannot say much about strategy after just 1 game - it's not obvious here.  I prefer 2-D abstract games (like GIPF project) nonetheless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Tactical 3D abstract that is somewhat lacking in clarity, and not just because there's topological potential that you literally can't see. The magnetic pieces click into place in a pleasant manner, while moving cubes around is occasionally awkward.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Excellent abstract game with a unique 3d aspect that I enjoy.  Top quality components. Relatively simple rules that are sometimes hard to initially grasp, but has a surprising amount of depth.  Some games end within a few moves while others have gone to a draw but it is fun to try different movements not fully appreciating the ramifications of them until it may be too late. AP could be a problem for some.

This is an intriguing abstract that I just can't quite decide what I think about it!  The 3D aspect is interesting although it does sit on the table.  Move sceptors or cubes allows for a fair bit of strategy but like most abstracts, one mistake can kill you as it seems to often start a chain reaction!

Abstracts just don't get much play in my house.  Sold in the Lydia charity auction.

Tentative rating of 7.5 after 5 games.  Fascinating 3D abstract.  I need to play it a few times with the same opponent; that is, learn the game with someone else.  Playing against people who've never played it before limits the amount I can explore it.  

The thinking it takes for this game is deeper than I expected; my brain doesn't adapt as easily as I thought to the third dimension.  I expect my rating of 7.5 to go up on more plays that delve more deeply into the game.

RATING: 10
Three-dimensional games can most often be emulated on two dimensions dividing the represented space into different parallel planes that can be visualised separately. This is not the case with Axiom: players need to get used to considering not the planes but the three different projections of the evolving board (the blocks that build the playing surface can be moved and stacked). 

As it can be expected, the main challenge in the game is getting used to this "spatial" thinking. Nevertheless, despite an easy goal (occupy with one of your two sceptres a block that contains a sceptre of the opponent) and intuitive rules for moving sceptres and for moving and removing blocks careful thinking is required: there are always few available moves (less and less as the playing surface shrinks) and these can change rather drastically when blocks are displaced. Obstacles play a vital role in guaranteeing a winning position - it takes some work to attack without leaving a fatal gap open.

While Axiom isn't a game with an overwhelming amount of choices every turn, its tricky and variable geometry makes quite a challenge of thinking several moves ahead; there's more strategy to it than it looks at first - Axiom is in that respect an ideal game for patient abstract game gourmets. The short duration of a round of play comes in very handy, and the game's visual (and tactile) appeal is undeniable.

RATING: 7
A 3D brain-burning abstract that wouldn't look out of place on the set of Star Trek or a Star Wars movie.  In my first game it took me a little while to get my head around the strategy of moving the cubes and sceptres and ensuring that a move I made wouldn't put me in danger.  For such an old game (1988) it still feels refreshing and should be able to hold its head high amongst more popular abstracts such as the GIPF project.  Rating may improve with more plays.

A true abstract. Hard to visualize at first, but worth a play, that is for sure. If you like abstract, I recommend it. ou move either a block or your token around the board trying to land on an opponents piece or preventing him from moving. Simple enough but the three dimensional design gives you more options.

August 2017: Upgraded from 9 to 10: This is like Chess but [b]much more accessible[/b]! Not as opaque as it seems! And not as brain-burning either! Really! Compared to chess, you have half the number of pieces (eight each). And pieces are less mobile than chess! (The board is much smaller!) And as players capture each others cubes, the playing surface shrinks, and the game eventually ends with a dramatic finish (often [b]unlike[/b] Chess!).

The use of these interlocking cubes for a modular board is genius. It actually feels like a maze game where players open up and close off paths for themselves and their opponent. Many of these kinds of maze games tend to be more tactical than strategic; the difference here is that players own cubes and thus have much more control of how this maze/board takes shape.

May 2008: Upgraded from an 8 to a 9: Incredibly unique mechanisms that (I think) ensure the game eventually ends since the board shrinks.

Feels like the endgame of a chess match. Brain burning, but because your moves during your turn are quite constrained, it isn't as tough as, for example Go.

Basic strategy involves increasing the mobility of your scepters and decreasing those of your opponent by altering the playing field. This takes a great deal of lookahead!

The gameplay just isn't nearly as engaging as the aesthetic.  They really did a great job on the art direction.  A good enough abstract, but very tactical and limiting.  I often felt that I could only choose from one or two moves then would check the results based on what my opponent made.  Trial and Error isn't my favorite method of playing.  Strangely for as high as the game is on the neat factor, it is remarkably low on the fun factor.

For some reason I particularly dig the orange/grey set. The transparent pieces are cool, too.

Managed to get myself one of the grey and orange sets.

As most reviews will tell you, there is something of an issue with the game in that It's not truly a 3 Dimensional game, which limits its utility somewhat. That said, it's a fine abstract. One of those strange abstracts that is both fast and deep, and quite brutal from time to time. Not an every day thing, but worth having in the collection.

The looks of Axiom is so unique, I just can not believe that this game was made almost 30 years ago.
And not just it's looks, the rules are also unique.
When I first played Axiom, I have no idea what to do, but after playing few games, I begin to understand it's strategy.
Creating and blocking the pass using your cubes, blocking opponent's cubes using your cubes or pawns, these are the experience I have never had before. 

If you are looking for unique game, buy it.
If you like abstract strategy game, buy it.
If you want the experience you have never had before, play it.

Even you do not like it on your first try, your feeling will gradually change while you play, just like Axiom.

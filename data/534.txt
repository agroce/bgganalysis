The addition of the helicopter and roadblocks are interesting additions. Playing as the detectives, I could've made better use of the roadblocks to cut off critical subway stations, but I didn't realize this until too late.

Also played this wrong our first time: we were giving the detective tickets to Mr. X (as in Scotland Yard) but in this game, detective tickets are instead discarded. Oops.

Works excellent for 2 players, with the second controlling 4 detectives.

Fun for the whole familiy. Detective game, us your mind and figure out where the thief is running. Demands house rules to reach its potensial. House rule: Thief can use any ticket always, and can never use 2 X in the move after exposing himself. Then it will be a challenge for both sides.

This game is really strange.  Some difference from Scotland Yard... you don't pass your tickets to Mr X.  You can apparently trade tickets between detectives (although we never did this in our game).  The road block seems overpowered and the helicopter seems somewhat underpowered.  But that is all only with one play.  I do like the pieces.

This game is just Scotland Yard set in New York. I like it, but I find the London map in Scotland Yard much more interesting. New York is just too much of a grid for my taste. If I didn't have Scotland Yard, I'd play this game, but I do, so I don't.

NYC is actually Scotland Yard with a different setting; I like deduction / hidden movement games. In this genre certainly better games exist, but this one is a good option for a short game; house rules are necessary because of imbalance in favor of the detectives.

Deduction. Similiar to Scotland Yard. Personnally, I find New York Chase harder for Mr. X than Scotland Yard. Not very balance. Boring. Best at 2 players.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

I don't plan to play New York Chase any time soon.

A re-implementation of Scotland Yard that works just as well. Players team up against one player (Mr. X) who is trying to escape the police net. By following X's trail and good coordination and communication, the police players can narrow down possible locations and nab him.

The addition of a helicopter and police barricades make this one a little more difficult (for Mr. X), but that's a good thing. I think the graphic design of Scotland Yard is easier to understand and follow at a glance, but it isn't too big a deal here.

RATING: 4
This is one of those rare games that after reading the rules, I had absolutely no interest in playing. Something about the stupid visor and the hidden movement just seemed so unappealing to me. I got the game for free, thrifted it away. It seemed fiddly, slightly boring, and just downright un-fun. I could be convinced to play if someone else wanted to, just to give it a shot (which I will do for any game once), but I wasn't gonna put the effort into teaching it myself. Especially if it turned out people liked it *shudder*.

RATING: 3
Terrible Scotland yard game in NYC.  If you play you should consider the following:

1.  Make the detectives go back and pickup the roadblocks before moving them (ie, don't let them teleport around, otherwise Mister-X has 0% chance and 0 fun).
2.  Never let Mister-X start down on the southern tip of the island.  He won't make it past the 2nd showing, if that.
3.  Go back to the original SL rules where all the tickets get turned into Mister-X for his use and you have full access to all the black tickets, irrelevant of the number of players

If you play this way, this game becomes ok....that's how it gets the 4.5.  Otherwise, it is broken and deserves a 1.0.

Interesting game, with good "suspense" mood. Cops have to find Mister-X, the bandit. The scenery is NY streets. I like to play it, but my wife not. :-)
It's not a simple game - you have to think a little. You can't just 'play for play'... you must pay attention all the time. Maybe that's why this game is not so easy.
Well, I like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is an absolutely excellent deduction game with more tension than most games I've played.  The game is equally tense and fun when playing as the fugitive or as a detective. Mister X does have a particularly difficult time escaping but I don't mind the imbalance as I often play with my kids as the detectives; the disadvantage for the fugitive means that they can beat me even if I'm trying my hardest to escape.

Just as good as it's big brother, Scotland Yard.  Introducing roadblocks and helicopters is a big plus to the game and also helps the detectives win more often.  While I do enjoy this, I think I'd rather play SY and add the roadblocks and chopper to it.  The board is better.

Cool game.  Nice idea and good mechanics.  The rating reflects my enjoyment of our first game, but I see some problems.  It's probably a bit more effort to play than we would normally want.  Also, I would never want to play as Mister X.  It's not that Mister X can't win, because I haven't played enough to know if that's true.  The problem is that our group already has a problem with AP.  Put us all on the same side, and it becomes group AP.  That's fine for the detectives, because we are all involved, but it probably sucked for Mrs X (although she never complained).  I have a different problem on the detective side.  I could easily be the guy who tries to tell everyone else to "do this" and "you go there".  I had to try to reign it in for this game.

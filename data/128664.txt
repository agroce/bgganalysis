RATING: 8
Fun game that feels like playing with flash cards.  Good for nerds that have an interest in history.  A player can get lucky draws and have an easy time, which makes the game feel cheesy sometimes.

I own most expansions and mixed them all up.

RATING: 8
It's very accessible. Trivia is a familiar genre to family-gamers. It is quick to set-up and put away. It generates conversation and debate, and the facts contained in the set are genuinely interesting. It's a great game to play in a coffee shop, or after a dinner party.

RATING: 7
Trivia games that do not require exact knowledge are usually nice and Timeline is no exception. It is simply fun to test knowledge, or should I say gut feeling, on when did certain event take place relative to others. Easy to teach and fun and quick to play. Guaranteed fun for casual gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The packaging is poor, but the game is a fun. You guess when each event occurred and place it in the correct spot on the timeline. It plays in a few minutes. 
It can be slightly embarrassing occasionally when you don't know when certain mayor events occurred. There is a decent degree of luck depending on which card you get which makes it easy to play with people of different skill levels. 
My one wish is that the cards would contain a little bit more information about the event when you reverse them.

Timeline is an interesting exemplar of party game: rules can be explained in 30 seconds, gameplay is fast and it can be enjoyed even by those who ignore most of the answers (luck can definitely help)!

So, even if I'm not among the target group, why don't I give a better rating to Timeline?
Because my edition is a little crappy: the game box is insanely huge and flimsy, especially compared to the original tin boxes; and, furthermore, they changed the card size so the various original expansions cannot be used!
This deduces 1 point from the rating, which should have been 6.5 (a very good rating for a party game...)!

RATING: 7
This is a great little filler game, you can literally teach it in minutes, the "rules" are stretched out to even fill a small sheet, it's that simple, yet it's a lot of fun.

Essentially you are laying down cards with inventions/events/etc on them and a date on the reverse. As you lay cards down you are building up a timeline, each player guesses where their card fits in the timeline, they then flip it over, if they're wrong they move the card to its correct place in the timeline and take another card - play proceeds until one person has placed all of their cards and is declared the winner.

It's a fun game for players of all skill levels, even if you're a true history buff it starts to get tricky once the timeline is long enough. I was concerned about replay value but really, unless you have a photographic memory, you can happily play this through a few times (since you will often find yourself in a position where you're sure the card you're holding is from the 1800s, but there are already ten cards spread over the 1800s so finding the exact spot is still a challenge).

I would have scored it slightly higher, however I purchased the 2012 reprint and the box really lets it down, the to extent that I've thrown mine away and am trying to find a smaller container to fit the cards into. It's the worst packaging I've seen for a long time, cereal-box thin like a software box from the 90's with a CD that clips really tightly over the cards so you have to fiddle around every time you want to get them out or put them back. 

The previous versions had neat little metal tins with a steampunk theme and just looked a lot better, a definite step back. It doesn't detract too much from the game but it makes it a hassle to get the game to the table unless you're willing to source a replacement.

I am a trivia fanatic, an avid quizzer. In traditional trivia games I have an egde over my friends, since I have so much useless knowledge stored in my brain, but in Timeline everyone who can have a logical series of thoughts can win and this is why I love this game so much. I own multiple sets, which I combine and take out when I want something shorter than the amazing Timeline: Challenge.

Family gaming with an educational element.  What's not to like?  Just a couple of things:  it's a hame they didn't include some background text on the cards to add to the educational side.  And replayability is low once you've got through the deck.  Still, we all have had a great time trying to pinpoint the date of the invention of the plus and minus sign, or the construction of the Zgreat a Wall of China.

2014-09-04 : The game has 2 major problems

Very simple party game where you must get rid of your cards by fitting the depicted events into the common timeline. When you guess wrong, you draw another card. It's usually very quick, but occasionally it can drag on indefinitely, as it gets increasingly difficult with each card added to the row. There is obviously a lot of luck of the draw and, unless you keep buying expansions, very little replayability.

Hm. This is something like Anno Domini light. It isn't triggering nearly as many laughs as Anno Domini, and (in my opinion) it suffers from too many cards that I find rather easy (meaning that the starting player has an immense advantage), but it has its merits as well. It plays faster than Anno Domini (which is a plus) and actually includes meaningful information one might want to learn. Replay value is rather low, though, and it comes in what must be one of the most ridiculously oversized boxes I have ever seen.

Great little trivia game - fast and almost no rules. Also it's not a game of knowing exact information - more of being the best at estimating.

The BIG downside is the limited number of cards - you'll see them all before you have played 10 times. It really needs an expansion NOW!!

Nicer sized cards than the French version (they used to be very small but now are pretty standard) but, as others have said, the new box is horrible.

a great little filler game - using cards that have an event or discovery on one side and the year it happened on the other - Each player gets 4 or 5 cars dealt year side down and plays one of his cards and tries to fit it in the array inbetween already played cards - then flip and see if the year fits in the timeline

fun and cheap but you wont be able to play too many games back to back as you will remember certain dates - timelines does have lots of different versions , cinema & music,history, inventions etc

Basically the same game as Chronology, except that you have a common timeline rather than each player having a timeline. It's a simple and enjoyable mechanic. Choose one of your cards and place it in the right spot in timeline order (from earliest to latest) amidst the previously placed cards. Fail and you draw another. First one to get rid of their cards wins. It can only really be played with people of the same age and background to be enjoyed by all, but it comes in at the right length, and can be an nice way to pass the time with friends. A bit educational as well, providing a bonus.

This simple card game asks players to date important events in history by placing the card for that event between other events people have played.  As play progresses, the board builds up, and you have to be more specific with your date range guesses.  It's a fun concept, but I have to wonder about replayability as eventually players will start to remember the dates.  Also, there's often some confusion as to what date the card refers to--for example, the "Terracotta Army" card referred to its modern discovery, not its original construction.

Könnyed, rém egyszerű szabályokkal bíró, gyors játék. Legnagyobb előnye, hogy akár nagy társasággal, akár 1-2 fővel is működik.
A lapok minősége (ennyi pénzért) talán némileg lehetne jobb is (fényes kártyalapokat találunk a dobozban). A doboz óriási nagy (java része levegős is, tehát könnyen horpad), a benne levő műanyag tálca szörnyű minőségű.
A kártyákon szereplő rajzok talán lehetnének szebbek, igényesebbek (pl. eredeti képekkel is készülhetett volna...). Mindez azért nem ront sokat a játékélményen.
Könnyed, filler, ami néha mosolyt tud csalni a résztvevők arcára. Nagyon tetszik benne, hogy mélyíti a passzív tudást (az évszámokat többnyire nem jegyzi meg az ember, de relatíve, időben, el tudja helyezni az eseményeket az ember). Különösen ajánlott családi körben.

Basically the same as Anno Domini, but this one has a mixed deck of topics (better) and only two thirds of the cards (worse), albeit prettier cards. The mixed set makes it more family friendly over the specific topic decks of Anno Domini. Not compatible with the other Timeline releases I think this is the pick of the bunch due to it having double the number of cards of the topic specific decks at a reasonable price point.

Can be a fun game with the right group of players. Very simple to explain and get up and running - you're placing cards based upon their chronological order, trying to get rid of your hand. As the timeline grows it becomes increasingly harder to find the right gap for cards you have remaining. I enjoy it with family, but my rating is based upon my feeling of its general reception with gamers and how I feel about playing with them.

This gets a big plus for me for having so many cards in the basegame (essentially it's 2 Timeline mini boxes in one). That level of replayability is wonderful.

It gets a small minus for the giant (and mildly flimsy feeling) cards. And it gets a huge minus for the lousy box that clearly won't stand up to any use/transportation/storage. That's a major failing on Esdevium's part.

Mediocre party-style game.  I imagine replay value diminishing very quickly indeed. It is at least quick to play.

Good to play with non-gamers that love quiz-games (like TP)
Like how you can guess your way out of your turn if you have no idea and still have a decent chance of getting it right.

Very nice - Timeline is a super light card game about history. I think you can even learn something when playing this game! Elegant stuff.

I'm not very good at this and at the same time don't really like it - I don't think in this case those are the same thing.  I find it very hard, intimidating, and in some ways embarrassing when I don't know some of these dates.

Eleg egyszeru kvizjatek, ahol kartyakon szereplo esemenyek, talalmanyok datumat kell megtippelni, de mindig relacioban a mar lerakott kartyakhoz. Igy persze ahogy egyre tobb kartya van az asztalon, egyre szukebbek az idosavok, ahova el kell helyezni az egyes dolgokat. Ha helyesen tippeltunk a kartya lent marad, de ha tevedtunk akkor eldobjuk es ujat huzunk - a cel persze az, hogy elsokent szabaduljunk meg az osszes kartyanktol.

Maga a koncepcio nagyon meno, az, hogy jatszva szerzel ismeretet kulonosen fontos pl. kisiskolas gyerekekkel jatszoknak, vagy az elvontabbtemakert nem lelkesedoknek. Adnak hozza raadasul egy CDt is, amin programkent van fent a jatek, igy akar egyedul is lehet jatszani... itt persze elveszik a kozossegi elmeny, ahogy egyutt eszleunk ra arra, hogy pl. a hordozhato szamitogep milyen regen eszebe jutott mar valakinek.

Ket altalanos es egy a magyar kiadassal kapcsolatos negativumot tudok mondani: 220 kartya van, tehat 5-10 jatek utan jo esellyel jon ki olyan lap, amit mar ismerunk (memoria bajnokok elonyben), ez rontja az ujrajatszhatosagot. Szinten kar, hogy nincs egy par mondatos leiras az egyes lapokon, nehany erdekes teny, amitol nem csak kortani de konkret ismereteket is tudna atadni a jatek (a Faunaban ezt remekul megoldottak a kulon kis fuzettel). A magyar kiadas csomagolasa eleg gyenge, aki tornyozza a jatekait, annak valami tarolasi megoldas utan kell neznie.

Commented after one game. Ok trivia game, but with wrong people it might get painful, because not everyone can remember even the most obvious dates nor have even a good guess. Better with people who know history. Replayability is not necessarily very good, at least not for continuous play.

This is like a one-dimensional history version of "Ausgerechnet Uppsala". And that is not a good thing.

Applies to all timelines...I really like how this plays and how it rewards a passing knowledge of order not specific times. I feel like I learn something each time I play this. It is such a great game to pull out for a filler. Highly recommend.

Very simple. Get rid of your cards by knowing the order of events. Collection of cards from [gameid=85256], [gameid=99975] and [gameid=113401].

It's a deck of cards in a ridiculously large box that I've replaced with a plain black deck-box.

This is probably the easiest game to play considering most of the time, players are simply guessing when a thing was invented or discovered relative to the cards already on the table. Still, it's good fun, vaguely educational and entertaining when folks make good guesses. I like how much discussion of history and general knowledge it precipitates too, which is a great thing.

RATING: 7
As a game itself it is probably just a 6 BUT as a mean to teach something, discover something, learning something and keep alive your curiosity, it's an 8. So I rate this a 7: super simple, super fast but i'd like to play it with my children a lot (if only they played with me...)

Light, plays 4 and 5 well, after seven games in a row we had worked our way through the deck. But they were a great seven games.

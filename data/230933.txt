Pretty straight-forward rondel game with lots of Feld-ian mechanisms.  Not much engine-building in the base game, but it seems like there is some with the first Module.  Neutral cube colors could be better, but the rest of the iconography is good.  Can't tell the Rieneck influence here; feels very much like Feld.

Stefan Feld... vs a Roll and Move. And I think Feld wins, but it's an incredibly low bar. As a roll and move, it's fine/good. I think I don't like it too much on other principles though - the analysis paralysis potential is too great, and it has some confrontational elements that I think are poorly implemented or misused here. It's also pretty long.

One of Feld's better games.  I generally don't like dice, but the amount of interaction. Fighting off the traitors (like rats in Notre Dame or disasters in Bruges) gave a pressing element and there were interesting decisions to be made when trying to find optimal places to move your worker.  With the apple and other modifiers, it can cause some AP, but I think that the impact is minor unless you are playing with people who are super paralyzed.

12/9/17:  I'd be interested in playing this again, and the rating may go up to a 7, but I don't think that it will go further than that.  I find the game to be excessively tactical, which for me is the opposite of building an economic engine. With 4 people it also clocked in at 2.5 hours,so about 30 minutes per player with 30 minutes instruction time.  There is also the luck factor with what dice rolls you get and what your initial cards are.  I

Set off in hope but hit on high scoring manors and third level flag bearer.  Traitors reminiscent of Notre Dame's rats.  Dice of Castles of Burgundy, but option choices felt very restricting - but necessarily so for the game design.  Happy to play again.

Flojo, la gracia de gestionar los dados es con las banderas pero se consiguen pocas por lo que apenas puedes cambiar los resultados de dados, personalmente si cuando caes en la casilla de conseguir banderas/cubos/escudos por influencia te dieran uno de donde tuvieras mayoría/igualdad de influencia podrías hacer muchas mas cosas, ademas que conseguir las mayorías de influencia aportaría mas dureza al juego, no solo por lo que puedas conseguir sino también por lo que puedas hacer dejar de ganar al resto de jugadores. Ademas al conseguirse mas cubos pondría que tuvieras que pagar uno de cada color para construir la edificio, con lo que habría sitios que tuviera que pagar 3 cubos para poder construirlo, lo único que habría que ver que hacer con tanto escudo (quizás repartir mas bandidos según avance la partida).

[i]Posted: 11/16/17, Rated: 4[/i]

According to my own scale: "4 - Not so good. I would rather not play it, but I could be talked into it on occasion if I have repressed the previous memories."  That pretty much sums up my feelings after my first play of [i]Merlin[/i], and it hurts.  I really wanted to like this game!  [i]Merlin[/i]'s lineage has some serious chops.  [designer=4958][/designer] is reaching god-tier status in my mind, and then there's [designer=142][/designer], the designer of [i][thing=24480][/thing][/i]!  How could they have gone so very wrong?

Let's begin with a positive: the production values are great.  The art, color saturation, the chunky henchman cylinders, and all of the other bits are fantastic.  You know that this is a Feld design going in because of all the ingredients being tossed together in the point salad.  And dice!  I love the tactile feel of rolling dice!  I was very eager to learn how these two giants incorporated dice into their design.

Not very well, I'm afraid.  I'm about to make an association here that fans of this game are not going to like: it's hard not to make a mental association between the game board in [i]Merlin[/i] and the one from [i][thing=2952][/thing][/i].  There's a ring divided into sextants, with different-colored capstones at the intersections.  These are like the "pie spaces" in [i][thing=2952][/thing][/i], only they're four spaces apart rather than seven.  There are also no "roll again" spaces, which as it turns out would have been a welcome touch.

There are lots of different actions filling in all of those spaces, and they allow you to interact with the different resource collection and scoring mechanisms.  And there are a lot.  Again, this is standard Feldian fare, but in [i]Merlin[/i] you really have to have a finger in all of the pies.  It isn't like [i][thing=102680][/thing][/i], where you can focus in only two or three areas and still be competitive.  And that's the problem: there are so  many things to do, the timing of which can be important, and the dice simply don't let you get there.  Even if you have the resources and the positioning, you ultimately may not be able to land on the little target space you need.

The end result is a game where many of my turns -- and there aren't very many, four turns per round as you place your dice one at a time, and six total rounds -- were on rails.  There wasn't a real decision to be made.  [i]Merlin[/i] isn't meant to be a roll and move game, but sometimes it felt like one.  Let's just say that the magic is gone.  Or rather, that it was never there to begin with.

My expectations were low for Merlin. Feld has been more miss than hit for me lately and I hadn't heard great things about this one. I was pleasantly surprised at how the game played. It is another point salad game with an interesting action selection mechanism. Roll dice and move your knights and Merlin around the board to take actions. There are 6 counties where you can use your henchmen to gain flags or shields or resources or influence. You can also build "manors in the environs" to score some area majority bonuses and get some free stuff. You need to fight off traitors and take advantage of any specialization by scoring points. You score from completing up to 1 mission card per turn too. These are little requirements that gain few points and can be significant over the course of the game. There are ways to influence your dice, but it is relatively costly so you need to be sure your using those features when it is timely. I'm not sure if there will be enough variety between plays.

RATING: 6.5
Mildly disappointed. Although the dice selection mechanic is similar to Castles of Burgundy (one of my favorites), the rondel makes it a very different game. Unlike Burgundy, you get little opportunity to manipulate the dice (or make use of unwanted rolls), so the game often requires you to take unattractive actions to get a better board position. Combined with the restrictiveness of the rondel, this means that turns can become scripted, since it often seems obvious which of your options is best. Will try again, but I can see my rating going down with further plays.

RATING: 6
It seemed like an engine building game, but then wasn't. You don't really ramp up your position over the course of the game, so each round seems samey. The mission cards provide a lot of points and you can definitely stumble into ones that are easier to fulfill than your opponents.

Really impressed by this newest Feld game. The board is gorgeous and the game plays very smoothly once the iconography/actions have been explained. I enjoy the way the rondel was integrated and I'm always a big fan of Euros with dice. It's definitely a fun puzzle to figure out the best way to use your dice rolls to get the most benefits possible. I also love the individual tech tree bonuses each player can unlock when completing contracts and the various ways to manipulate your dice to create big scoring combos, one of Feld's trademark. There is nothing really unique, but it is another solid offering from Feld.

Good game, and an average game for Feld. It has a neat rondel filled with actions and good dice usage for actions. I prefer some of his other well known titles like Trajan, Bora, and CoB over Merlin for game depth. Merlin seems more on the lighter-medium side of A Feld game. Would like to play more And explore other strategies.

It's not you, it's me.

To be fair, I didn't find the common complaints, which took on the flavor of "an apple is the only way to change your die, and you have to get lucky to land on the grail and get one" to be true.  There's a lot of ways to mitigate dice luck and change your specific action that you might not want by collecting, trading, and playing flags.

We just didn't enjoy it.  I think we far prefer engine building & planning out long term strategies to a game of pure tactics.  It's not that we don't enjoy that kind of thig, it's just not our bag with this level of stuff going on.  I think we'd rather play something fifteen-thirty minutesy if we want this.  I get the same feeling from something like Battle Line or Manhattan Project Chain Reaction that I get from this - and if I have a longer tactical game, I'd rather it be more interactive like Twilight Struggle.

Fun fast game that is easy to teach and play. A bit of a fiddle to set up initially, but with two players we usually play two or three times which offsets set up time. Excellent quality components and nice theme. Enough options to give harmony to the dice throwing and playing the King's Favor module gives more and adds to the strategy. It's a light-medium game and probably a good gateway game. Taken for what it is supposed to be it's a solid 8, we will give the extra point for the amount of play we are currently getting out of it.

Felds are starting to feel a bit samey. How many designs does he have in that mold? Still, it's pretty decent. It's effectively a dice allocation game. Dice are simply allocated to move your dude around a rondel, and you take the action of the space you land on. Each player has a dude in their color, and there's one community piece (Merlin) which gets moved by neutral dice, of which everyone gets one. Given that you only have 3 dice each round to move your own guy, you really don't have that many choices for actions you get on your turn. That's one concern I have with the game that despite my general liking, keeps me from rating it higher. Another concern is the balance of the optional component for scoring missions. Missions are cards that you get rewarded for meeting various conditions. With the variant, instead of getting VP (the standard reward), you can instead get a bonus on a menu of bonuses (each player has their own board), which has 3 levels. I don't think the 3rd level is enough reward to warrant foregoing the VP. The copy I played had the Queenie 1 mini expansion. This was really nice, and I really think they should have included that in the base game. No reason not to. Could have been done with the same count of components. Just printing on already-existing tiles. I will wait to buy until the game is reprinted with Queenie 1 included.

I really, really liked this game a lot.  That being said, I really like worker placement games with unique movement mechanics - Feld's previous game 'Trajan' is in my top 5. 

The core mechanic centers upon rolling 4 dice, and then moving your character or Merlin based on the pips of those dice.  It's possible to get screwed by that randomness, but you start out with the tools to mitigate bad rolls, and you can win if you don't stop stockpiling them (and save them for when disaster strikes).  

Also, this is just a gorgeous board.  Overall, this was a real treat, and I look forward to this one hitting my table again.

I dont mind the luck since every space gives you something.  

Reminds me of the colonist in that you have to plan your 3 actions at once.  

Seems like there is extra point salad in this and I often found that I had a few options that would render me almost similar amounts of points.  This makes it more AP inducing as you math it out.

There are many chits that give powers or points that you often have to surrender and whether you surrender or not is a involved point calculation.  Wrapping your head around it is fatiguing.

RATING: 7.5
Dice driven worker placement with lots of different scoring possibilities. Over 6 rounds players throw 4 dice, 3 for their own pawn, and 1 for the Merlin pawn, in order to move these pawns around an action rondel (Merlin can move in 2 directions). Every 2 rounds there is a scoring round. The movement restrictions imposed by the dice can be circumvented by means of flags which can be collected, or by means of special favours bestowed upon the player as he forfeits taking points when fulfilling the conditions of a scoring card (of which each player always has 4). Scoring is done by gathering most influence in each of the 6 regions around the rondel, by building a majority of castles on a side board consisting of hexagons, by collecting shields, flags, resources, by claiming Excalibur, by having henchmen in the 6 regions... Points salad galore ! The theme doesn't really shine through the aalad, though.

I really enjoyed it, i'm happy to say, after so many mixed reviews. This is a review with the king's favor and Treasures of the Environs expansion included, which seem like essential no brainers to me*. First of all, contrary to many opinions, I think the game offers plenty of mitigation and flexibility. There is almost a sense of vertigo with the rondel and dice mechanic, where every choice chains together and effects every other choice, and to really unlock the options in the game you gotta seek plays that are multiple moves deep. Apples and flags cascade to change all subsequent moves for the round. These aren't simple CoB style worker mitigations, (I honestly don't understand why everyone wishes for those to be present here, tbh). Working towards goals on the cards helps motivate and focus towards the acquisition of resources that then enhance you power and options in further turns. The environs bonuses (especially with expansion) are a great way to get needed resources, and the level 2 powers for each henchman on the king's favor board are super powerful for creating flexibility and mitigating the restrictive flow of the rondel. One player didn't enjoy it much and in my opinion he failed to understand the possibilities, treated it more like a simple roll and move, and was overwhelmed by that sense of vertigo i mentioned and let the game play itself based on his dice, looking for a simple successful move each turn and being frustrated when it wasn't there. I found it to be much deeper, and think comparisons to Aquasphere are apt in this regard (ie careful consideration makes the game much more fun, unlike, say, CoB which is fun no matter how much you grind your brain). Deep or shallow as you play it, turns generally move fast, the scoring is easy to grasp and in fact, of all of Feld's point salads, I found this one to be the most focused regarding how and why points are received. Bora Bora and Trajan for instance, feel much more point salad kitchen sinky than this to me. It is a bit lighter than those games, which fills a welcome spot in my collection, since it's a great puzzler that's more broadly accessible that Feld's heavier fare. The interaction was also pretty strong with Merlin, both area control zones, henchmen placement, and Grail and Excaliber competition.  I definitely suggest fans of Feld games give this a serious look and multiple plays before passing it up. 

*(I made my own Environs expansion by just adding the bonuses to each tile with a sharpie. I don't care for Queen games handling of this game and and i'm not precious about components so DIYing the expansion works just fine for me).

Update:
I now own Merlin and have played two full games sonce demoing it at Gen Con.  I still rate it a 9.  Yes, it's a roll and go game, BUT you roll four dice (counting Merlin) that can be used in any order, have a plethora of ways to change your action (apple changes die face, blue flag flips die, orange flag takes an opponent's action, brown flag teleports you across the round table) AND you get to see you opponent's dice, which helps plan your Merlin move and the use of orange flags.  Getting flags isn't a wasted move either, as you can use them to fulfill victory cards throughout the game.  I struggle with AP and this game moves along at a click.  I honestly don't get the hate.  I think Merlin, like most Feld games, is brilliant. 

Previous Review:
Based on two short demos at Gen Con 50, this seems amazing!  Its a dice-based, rondel game with LOTS of choices and ways to get points.  You choose actions by moving your own knight around, but all players can also move a Merlin pawn.  There is an area control component on a separate board, but it's just one of many things you can do.  It reminded me a bit of a brain burnery Staufer Dynasty mixed with Castles of Burgundy and maybe Macao.  I'll be grabbing this as soon as it is released!

RATING: 2
2017-07-10 : First play. You have 24 actions in the entire game. Straight away 6 of them, a full quarter of your actions, will be entirely determined by the dice you rolled as you'll end up the round at the sum of the 3D6 positions clockwise from where you started the round. Whether that action is useful to you or not. And mostly it will be not. 
Every action will typically give you points in the 1-4 range, so you can't afford to not undo the effect of the 9 times -3 point attacks - so that's another 9 actions you have virtually no choice in not pursuing. That leaves 9 actions you can more or less decide what to do with. And that's provided you rolled the correct numbers. 
In this game your only chance of doing well is by getting lucky that the random initial quests you get combine somewhat with the defensive measures you need to take against the random attacks. Add in the other random factor that your board position may be awful for dealing with the attacks you just randomly got as your expected movement on 3D6 in any single round is less than half the rondel's total spaces. 
Oh, but you can mitigate against that they say. Yes you can, you can sacrifice an action now to get something (apple, flag) in order to be able to mitigate a later disastrous dice roll. That's not mitigation, that's another action down the drain. 
Then there's the player interaction. There's almost none of it. On occasion it might occur that an action you take removes another player's marker or takes a majority away, but that's almost incidental -  you weren't aiming for that, it's just a side effect of the action you had to take for your own goals. Expect a solo variant of this to only require a single page of rules.
So to recap : almost no decision space and extremely luck driven and thus probably the worst Feld I ever played - and I played a lot of them. The only saving grace is the excellent layout, graphics and iconography. And that's the only thing which makes this a 4 instead of a 2.
2017-12-21 : Reconsidered - won't ever play this again, so it's a "2"

I never felt I had real control over what I was doing. In overall the game never gave me any sense direction towards a bigger goal. Each round you roll your dice and that's the direction you have to work with even if it doesnt fit what you where planning towards the previous round. 
If you roll bad it's harder then any other Feld games to alter your dice. There are a few options but unlike his other games you also need these resources to do other things (complete cards for example).
In the end it's not a bad game and I would like to play it again when I'm in the right mood ;)

Had a good start with this game. I was 20 points behind before the last round, and ended up 1 point behind the winner. Totally unexpected. The game is not the best Stefan Feld game. The reason for this is that you have no underlying strategy to go for (refrained: you could decide to go for something, but your dice might fool you). But it's a nice tactical game. I would play it again.

Played with packed in expansion and Queenie 1.

Very enjoyable, but went long.  Almost a brain burner as you figure out a plan for all of your dice at the beginning of a round.  If you have one or two dice adjusting abilities, the options are almost overwhelming.  I'm not sure I get all of the dissension over the roll-and-move mechanic as implemented here.  Always keep a way out from bad rolls.  Get backup flags/apples soon allowing much more flexibility.  It's not a waste of turn to get those mitigation options like it is in Castles of Burgundy because flags are on some mission cards, and also gaining a flag is one of the results you get from placing one of your four henchman.  It's not a pass, but part of the natural course of the game.

Mission cards and traitor draw is very luck dependent, though.  Not enough to ruin the game, but can be a bit frustrating when the things just don't line up for you.  Again, have extra ways to manipulate the dice and you can make your bad luck turn around fairly easily.

Brettspieler, die Spiele von Stefan Feld nicht mögen, können an dieser Stelle aufhören zu lesen: Sie werden auch mit MERLIN nicht warm und kein Parzival werden. Denn auch MERLIN ist trotz Kooperation mit Michael "CUBA" Rieneck ein typischer Feld wie Spiele von Rosenberg eben typische Rosenbergs sind. Man mag den Style oder eben nicht. Und so trägt auch MERLIN die unverkennbare Handschrift: die Hipster gewordenen, schönen Würfelaktionen kombiniert mit diversen Zusatzaktionen, Nebenkriegsschauplätzen, Haribo Colorado Punktemix und dem üblichen Stachel im Fleisch: in NOTRE DAME sind es Ratten, in AQUASPHERE Oktopoden, in DELPHI Wundenkarten, in MERLIN sind es gemeine Verräter, deren man sich erwehren muss. Ansonsten ist MERLIN selbstredend eine Tafelrunde, die man mit seinen Würfelzahlen im Kreis entlang marschiert, um dort Aktionen auszuführen - mit freundlichen Grüße an das Rondell von Mac Gerdts. MERLIN ist nicht der Heilige Gral auf den man gewartet hat: das Spiel macht nichts neu, aber es macht auch nichts falsch und einfach locker Laune, zumal es sich für ein gehobenes Kennerspiel-Euro auch nicht groß in die Länge zieht. Schön ist, das es der nicht gerade vor Sympathie strotzende Verlag Queen Games jenseits seines Family-Schrott-Portfolios mal wieder ins Vielspielerregal schafft. Excalibur im Billy-Regal.

From the reviews coming out this won't be a public favorite of Feld's but it still will be for me.  I adore the smooth play and always feel as if I have something somewhat useful to do on my turn.  The Queenies, especially #2, can really help with that.

Personally, I find this much more enjoyable than In the Year of the Dragon or Notre Dame, even though I am clearly in the minority there. 

I wish I could make many enjoy it, or more importantly, I wish I could enjoy ITYOD and ND this much. Lol

Could end up being one of the best Felds.  No really.

1) Very smooth and intuitive.

2) Brisk pacing with little opportunity for AP.

3) Quality decisions and your strategy feels personal.

Possible cons: 
1) A little fiddly with setup 

2) mission card luck could be an issue here even though there are two spaces on the board to help remedy that.

A monopoly stlye game in 2017, seriously?!

It feels like Rieneck put in the dice "mechanism" and Feld did the rest as that's exactly what he does all the time. Many tiles with many effects.

Well, the dice part is like monopoly, as you choose one of your die to go clockwise only... The whole map-part of the game feels forced in and strange in combination, it doesn't fit the rest of the game.

Just an underwhelming experience in all aspects.

Everything about this game is just random. Dice control almost everything you do with a few ways to make your actions more deterministic (flags & apples) but they are difficult to come by. The design just seems random as well with the mysteriously included area control Manors. The theme is decent if you really think about how the actions could be explained in a Medieval setting but on a surface level, it just seems plastered on. 

Also the quality of the components is quite poor for the price point. The henchman are laughably low quality being just stickers stuck onto wood cylinders, the manors are just cardboard cutouts and the meeples don't correspond with the theme at all.

RATING: 6
Disappointed, I'm a big Feld fan but this feels a bit too random to me. You don't get many apples so adjusting you're rolls is difficult. I feel like rondel is too big so you can't consistently do similar actions. Maybe it will grow on me. I'm thinking probably not.

Really nice rondel game with your typical Feld point salad design. The gameplay is very smooth once you get the icons down. Unfortunately the game is quite short and each player barely went around the rondel twice. So once you miss a spot probably due to a bad roll, you'll find it hard to revisit the spot again. The board is beautiful and brings to live the entire medieval Camelot theme. Love to play this again with more players.

Not a bad game, but one that is too random for what it is. I believe that the included expansion, and Queenie 1 are mandatory, and likely what Feld turned in as the full game. The base game feels like a stripped down game, add in those two mini-expansions and I'd bet dollars to donuts that it feels like a full fledged Feld game. I'll find out soon. Keeping for now, but it's definitely closer to the trade pile than not.

If I hadn't known that this is a Feld game and had to guess, I would have guessed on Feld. Trajan, Aquasphere, Castles of Burgundy all come to mind. Actions come in sextuplicate again, punishment is near as usual in Feld games. It would be interesting to know what Rieneck's contribution is.

Like in Trajan, the action is chosen on a rondel. This time, the own pawn and a jointly owned pawn (Merlin) move on the rondel driven by dice. Resources can be converted, majorities have to be gained, tasks are fulfilled and the country is to be settled. Another classic Feld. After one partial play my feeling is that Merlin is good at an Aquasphere level but not on par with Trajan and Castles of Burgundy.

Sadly enough the dice are too present with the mitigation being very few and far in between.

We wanted to love Merlin. The central rondel puzzle is so easy to learn, so slick, and so engrossing — it is easily one of my favourite mechanisms of the year. The game built around this mechanism for us lacks progression. Turns feel the same at the end as at the beginning. And Merlin does nothing to help balance players of different skill. We would love to see this rondel revisited as a component of a larger game rather than the central focus.

Dropping my rating from a 5 -> 3 after my second play. I'm done with this one. It is dry, boring, with little opportunity to manipulate dice and barely grants an illusion of control and still creates AP in many cases. I don't know how it manages to do this, but I can't play this boring mess again. The randomness factor is way too significant in this one in both the mission cards and the dice rolling. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Had low expectations to begin with and I'm not sure the game even met those low expectations. Cancelled my pre-order. Maybe a second play with all the modules in play will change my opinion but I wasn't overly thrilled with this one. Roll four dice and then make your plans since it is almost impossible to manipulate your dice without obtaining a few special tiles that allow you do so - as long as you can land on the spaces that allow you to obtain these and don't need something else more. Look ahead and figure out how you want to spend your three dice and take those three actions. The Merlin dice is less predictable as everyone will move it once each round.

Decent game from Feld and Rieneck, but not the best from either.

The base game (without the first two Queenie expansions) just feels incomplete, like those two parts were pulled out to be used as selling points, or maybe to make the game more accessible to new players. As it stands it can be dull and frustrating for experienced gamers.

The full game is much more interesting. There's plenty to do with mission cards, and maximizing points from them really focuses your game. Utilizing the complete Environs, players have several additional ways to acquire the things they need for mission cards and die roll flexibility.

Using dice to drive your knight around a rondel of possible actions which have a variety of possibilities is a different approach to the point salad of some of the previous games. The actions are all linked back and mesh well together.

This could easily become one of my favourite Feld games. It plays quickly and there are always points to be had. Analysing your possible moves becomes easier as the round progresses as you have less dice to consider.

This is a typical Stefan Feld point salad game. The round table board looks great. You get you points through accomplishing quests (tasks for game constellations) at the end of your turn and for area control areas at the en d of round 2, 4 and 6. You can often achieve everything that you need if you think about it a lot.

RATING: 8.5
Other than about ten minutes worth of battles with iconography, this is a deceptively easy game to pickup and teach/learn.

The elegant and intuitive rondelle feature is brilliantly augmented by a map that is randomly generated each time you play.

The theme fits nicely.

While it's true that the game doesn't change much as you go, not everything needs to be an engine builder. This is quite a quick play that doesn't get bogged down as you progress - don't get me wrong, I love getting "bogged down in fun" in the right game, but I see this as a great "transition from gateway" game for the right player.

Lucky enough to get 2 plays in.  Second play definitely went much smoother than the first as far as understanding all the options and their ramifications.  It is another point salad game.  However, it is a GREAT point salad game.  Theme makes sense, and decisions are tantalizing.  Haven't been able to wrap my head around how to get the most benefit out of the expansion board, but maybe next time.

While it bears some similarities to Burgundy, Delphi and Trajan, it's probably lighter than any of them. It looks incredibly complicated on the table, but in practice it's a point salad roll and move game where one has to make the best of their myriad options. It's pleasant to play because there are very few "bad" moves... and even the typical Feldian invaders aren't that terrible if left to ransack your castle... The two included expansions (the special powers and the building bonuses), actually improve the game, adding to dice manipulation possibilities.

Rather tiresome Feld: every action gets you points but nothing is particularly interesting. There’s some mild tug-of-war for influence, and some decisions on whether to spend stuff or save it for filling tickets, but that’s pretty much it. And if you run out of stuff which manipulates dice, you’ll get screwed by not having anything sensible to do on your turn.

The actions themselves are simple, there is no resource conversion or production, and most of all: no convoluted end scoring. The game can drag on for a surprisingly long time regardless.

 Everything has its own place on the board and especially on the player boards but the terrain hex area does not match this UI design: the prices for castle building are quite slow to decipher.

Merlin is essentially Stefen Feld's take on a roll-and-move game. Here, though, you're rolling three colored dice and one white die--you can use the former to move your pawn clockwise on the action wheel and the latter to move the shared Merlin pawn in either direction on the action wheel. There are a wide range of actions that you can take on this 24-space wheel, including claiming Excalibur (extra points during scoring) or the Grail (tiebreaker for region area control), placing manors on the side board (another form of area control), swapping out goal cards, getting points for various things, etc., etc. The most important spaces, however, are the principality spaces, which occur every four spaces and are associated with a large region of the board. These allow you to place henchmen, which can allow you to get a shield (for avoiding penalties), place influence (for area control), get a flag (special ability), or get a resource (for building manors). Suffice to say, there's a lot going on in this game, and like many of the recent Feld designs, all of the options usually lead to scoring points. What stood out to me is that practically all of the decisions in this game are short-term ones--most of your ways of getting points don't last past the next scoring phase. While I did really like planning out how to chain my dice so as to best activate certain action spots in a certain order, I do wish at least some of the decisions I made in the game had a permanent impact on how I played the game. So, I thought this was fun, but it could've been better.

Already on 1K people's wishlist. The new Stefan Feld game co designed with Michael Rieneck. It really has the feel of a Feld game. It is also a Rondel. You have some dice to use for movement. Lots of way to score points. You know the drill. I had a great time playing this one and I really do look forward to the release.

In this game, each player rolls four dice, three in their own color, and one in white. Then on their turn, they can use one of those dice to move their pawn clockwise on the action selection wheel a number of spaces equal to the pips on that die. They can also chose to use the white die to move the shared white pawn instead. The actions vary in their usefulness, and often times you can be without a move that benefits you much. What you are aiming to do most of the time is manage to land on the spaces that give you the ability to place one of your four pawns. Each pawn has a different result when placed, but mostly they get you the things that will allow you to earn points by completing randomly drawn objective cards, or by fighting for majorities, or fending off the randomly drawn invader tiles, who when unmitigated during a scoring round will cause you to lose three points each.

Competing for majorities is difficult, as you won't really have a sense of what spaces you'll manage to be able to get to due to the random aspect of the dice, nor do you have a sense of where your opponents will be able to go. There's also a disjointed second board that also has majority scoring but by a different method than the one on the main board. This second board tends to reward whomever gets there first with big bonuses, and then continues to reward that player for holding that area throughout the game. 

The game has a lot of different forms of luck mitigation, but your ability to acquire that mitigation relies on the luck of being able to land on the spot to get it. It also eats a turn to get it, and those luck mitigating items are also the things you often need on the randomly drawn objective cards, so spending them on mitigation feels like it's often a bad idea.

The iconography isn't great simply because there are two types of actions that look the same but function very differently. This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine.

The game also comes with a mini expansion that adds a sort of tech tree, where four times per game, rather than scoring an objective card for points, you can put a seal on the ability on your player board that matches the picture of the card and the victory points of the card. For example, the level 1 tech for each type of character is you score 1 more point each time you score a card of that type. Once again however, the draw of these cards is random so it's something that will happen for you or not depending on draw luck. The second level abilities seem uncompelling. 
 The third level abilities are the most interesting ones, however they can only be used once per 2 rounds, which means there's a big advantage to getting one or two completed before the first reset, which relies on a lot of things lining up for you that you have no real control over. 

Overall the raw experience of the game is enjoyable as a tactical but random romp, but I don't think I'd ever buy it or suggest playing it myself.

I really enjoyed my first play of Merlin!  I played my first game with both the Kings Favor and Queenie 1 expansions.  This is a really fun tactical game that was close the whole game.  We never had a runaway winner during the game, which I love.  Definitely looking forward to getting this one back to the table.   I was surprised with how much player interaction is involved in this game.  not sure why there is bad buzz going around for this one.

This is just a typical Feld - lots going on, and everything is worth about 2 points, and your aim is to squeeze out those extra points each turn.  Fun to play once, but I can't see it having much replay for me, and the owner had some concern about you getting stuck with your initial card draw and getting off to a slow start, which he says he's seen in several games now.

Kickstartered.  Enjoyed playing this game and the mechanic of rolling dice and trying to maximize what you can do with your knight and Merlin based on your rolls.  Like all Felds, there are lots of decisions to make, and different ways to score points, though not as many as in many of his other games.  Artwork is colorful and gameplay is smooth.

Feld's take on a roll-and-move game, with a very Feld-like outcome. I'm unsure how Michael Rieneck's input affected the overall design, as it's clear that Merlin has Feld's fingerprints all over it. Like most dice-as-actions games, player roll dice and get actions based off their rolls. Only here, these actions are determined by moving the players' knights along a rondel.

There are a variety of ways to score VP, although most of those gains are incremental. There are tasks to complete, two separate area majority subgames, and penalties to avoid. Unlike most point salads though, Merlin requires players to spread their scoring options out a little more than usual. That said, Merlin is on the lighter end of Feld's offerings – it is easy to grasp the interconnections between the various actions. There still is a fair amount of thinking involved in optimising your dice rolls, but it is by no means one of Feld's more imaginative or memorable designs.

Tipikus Feld a Merlin. Rengeteg akció, rengeteg helyről szerezhető pont.
Artúr király utódját keresi a kerekasztal lovagjai közül. A játékosok egy-egy lovagot testesítenek meg, akik a kerekasztal körül járva, akciókat végrehajtva keresik az uralkodó kegyét. Körünkben 4-szer akciózunk, 3-szor a lovagunkkal, egyszer Merlinnel a varázslóval, aki szintén körbe jár az asztal körül, de ő tud mindkét irányba, míg lovagunk csak az óramutató járását ismeri. Várakat építhetünk, befolyásokat szerezhetünk és árulókat kell legyőznünk a célunk elérése érdekében. 4 kockával dobunk, ezekből 3 a lovagunk lépését határozza meg, egy pedig Merlinét. Jól kell időzítenünk, Merlin lépését, a többiek dobását látva. A játék jól működik, szép, de nem emelkedik ki a feldi játékok közül. Tetszett.

It’s a Feld, with lots of things happening and lots of ways to score points, but it felt a bit less convoluted than many of his other recent offerings. Kind of fun, with the dice rolling and hand/token management stuff, but I still prefer Macao and Bora Bora.

I really wanted to like this more than I did. I love the idea of updating the roll and move mechanic. You roll 4 dice each round and each turn you use one of the die to move around the rondel, where you land gives you some kind of benefit. It makes for some interesting decisions, do I use the '2' die now or should I use the '5', etc etc. There is also the Merlin pawn on the rondel that everyone can move. Points then are collected through contract fulfillment and area control. The aspect that fell flat for me was there was limited options in how to mitigate dice rolls. It made my last round pointless as the banners I had didn't help and since it's the last round getting more banners isn't very helpful. This game also desperately needs some kind of player aid to remind you what scores in what rounds.

RATING: 7
Probably the most average Feld game I've played. Far from his best work.

I do like the quest card system though. It smooths out a lot of the gameplay that would otherwise feel very suffocating and frustrating.

I also feel like the Queenies should've just been part of the base game but I guess Queen will always be Queen.

RATING: 2.5
I long for those blissful, ignorant days when I thought that Rum & Pirates was the worst Stefan Feld game I would ever play. Merlin is a melange of egregious random elements, including dice to wander around a rondel, random mission cards and, crucially, a set of three traitors to fight off each round to avoid a penalty of 3 points for each.

It's possible to mitigate the luck of the dice (flags, for example, allow flipping dice, jumping to the opposite side of the rondel and other manipulations), but actions are very scarce and and the opportunity cost of claiming these items can be high. The mission cards do, in theory, reward all "paths to victory" by awarding points for collecting flags, shields etc., but with the obvious caveat that a player who lucks into missions they can already fulfill is better off than one who doesn't. Missions for shields, for example, are problematic as players will be collecting these to fend off specific traitors: much better to you have a shield mission that matches the colours of your traitors than not.

Possibly the worst mechanism is the Merlin staff, which allows doubling of an action taken by the Merlin figure, which can be moved once each round by each player. Each player has three staves, which can be spent to double one of these actions. Several of the spaces score victory points for collecting different things (e.g. one point per flag) and doubling these can provide a massive payout -- if you can get there, which brings us right back to the dice.

Most Feld games I find uninteresting but enjoy as "efficiently shopping for point salad" activities. That is not the case here. Merlin is a hot mess. It's just not good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I was fairly disappointed with Merlin.  Its a roll and move where many of your options are severely constrained.  It is far too long and complicated for as shallow an experience as it is.  Some of the game systems seem somewhat half-baked (only one way to obtain apples, area majority is uninteresting.)  

I think the area control mini-game is the exact kind of gameplay I don't care for, where the first player to get in has a big advantage, and in order to combat that, someone has to hurt themselves somewhat to the benefit of the third party.

I'd try it again to see if some of the modules make it better.

The game is a dribble of vp's each turn.  The luck of the dice and the one way track create a unexciting trip and the barbarians can hammer you if you are not lucky with your dice to ameliorate the problem.  the game works and if you are a Stefan feld fan then you will like the game.  me not so much

After a single play, this game reminds me a lot of Castles of Burgundy. It's of course a completely different game, but it has the same kind of relaxed find-the-best-use-for-your-dice puzzly feel and it has a similar length. It's better than I expected (and certainly the best roll-and-move game I ever played :-D )

After 5 plays: definitely not CoB good, but it's a pretty good game.

RATING: 7.3
tl;dr: feels like a Feld

This is not a classic Feld point salad game, but it still has plenty of things that field very Feldian. For starters, you use dice to determine what actions you can take. The challenge here is: how do you puzzle the best path with what you roll? You have one pawn that you can move in one direction, and there is a shared pawn that can move in either direction to select actions. So the puzzle gets quite complex quite fast.
In essence you're trying to gather some resources and other things and position some pawns in certain locations to fulfill order cards. But the way the different elements do different things give you a lot of freedom of how you approach things.
Quite interesting.
Oh yeah, Feld didn't make this one by himself, but I think his stamp is most noticeable. But kudos to both designers for a solid game!

I don’t mind this. It’s much more tactical than strategic as you can’t plan too far ahead, but the dice alllocation mechanism does mean you can plan decent chunks of the game at a time, and there are many ways to mitigate the luck of the dice rolls.

Rating after one incomplete play at Essen. OK medium weight game. Move your pawn on a rondel with three dice, so select a set of three actions. Use them to collect stuff, convert stuff, fight for majorities in two sets of regions. A bit overwhelming in the beginning but should play smoothly after a while. Limited interaction between players.

Call me insane but this felt like a spiritual successor to Feld's own Macao.  Bonus points for the designer's bold choice to incorporate roll-and-move as a legitimate mechanic in the year 2017.  Hard to say if this game favors the tactical mind over the long-term planner, but probably worth exploring another play or so.

I played twice and ran a bunch of demos at Gen Con 17. You use dice as the movement points per action for your knight (clockwise) and the Merlin token (either direction) on a Round Table rondel. Each player gets to move Merlin once per turn so deciding when to move him is important. There are ways to manipulate the dice but it is hard to do it much. There are task cards that you can complete and turn in one per turn for additional points (1-3). These are important because you don't lose the materials used to complete them. Major scoring happens after every two turns (of six) and consists of fighting off marauders (negative points if you fail), two area majority areas, and getting henchmen on the board. I think the combination of two excellent designers, Rieneck and Feld, has made a great game.

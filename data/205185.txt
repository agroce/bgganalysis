Unique game with a kind of Tangram mechanic that brings to the table Einstein's life. Could remind a bit to Blueprints, and got an expansion that completely changes the game and makes it even more interesting. Very good job here.

Fun, easy set up, and a pretty good puzzle. I like the history lessons on the cards. Painstaking to ensure every piece is placed correctly though. Would definitely recommend though.

We were really surprised by this little gem.  It's quick playing, and quite light, but it manages to provide an interesting and enjoyable challenge.  The main puzzle is completing your inspirations, of course, but also trying to snag the major theories and, perhaps most interestingly, trying to piggy-back on top of other pieces to complete your inspirations first.

That gives this game a surprising tempo element, as you can either go slow and work on your own portion of the big idea, or go fast and work off of others' contributions.  The latter plan will score you less points, but it can control the end game (and enable you to snag some major theories too).

Really looking forward to trying out a 3p or 4p game, if only to see how the big idea works out.  There's also the interesting tempo dynamic of completing a piece using contributions from multiple players.  That could lead to some interesting decisions about who to give points to, and when.

Finally, the mathematician in me is thrilled to see the use of Penrose tiles here!

A quick game with tanegrams that is the right length for a filler.
On your turn you place two tiles into a shared tableau. If you are able to create any of the formations on the goals in your hand you score them, and/or any relevant public goals. If someone's tile(s) helped you do your personal goal, they get a point as well which is nice.

Abstract tiling laying game in which you are trying to create and match patterns.  I appreciate the historical flavor text on each card.  I can see Einstein being an ok filler game, but not much else and there are better games in that genre.

Played at GenCon, really liked how the pieces all go together in the center as each player tries to form shapes. The public cards add more ways to earn points. We liked that it is kind of thinky but we can play with our 8 year old. Fun, fast game.

A nice short game. 15-30 minutes I'd say.

For some the challenge is already the visualization of the 4 odd shapes in ones mind. For those that get used to seeing the requested patterns, this game actually gets quite interesting. Quite a few factors to take into account:
- How many points am I willing to give an opponent while scoring points myself.
- The game has different ending conditions which absolutely influence your decisions.

First Impression: Played well as a 2-player game. I saw it demo'ed at BGG Con and knew to expect a light game with great looking components. The art is really nice and the information on the cards will provide some interesting reading outside the game. The private and public objectives are fine, but without the expansion I would expect them to get samey after about 10 plays. This would shorten its life for me, but is probably fine for the target audience. Fortunately, I have the expansion and so will crack that open pretty quickly.
Unfortunately the rules are a mess. They look great. The graphic layout is like a comic and they look inviting. However, the rules text is a ridiculous font and is too small. Another font used in the rules is even smaller. The rules are also unclear on some very basic information. It is a very simple game and easy enough to figure out so you shouldn't have to reference them after the first play, but this isn't something that I would expect to be taken for granted.

RATING: 5
Turns take way too long and you cannot really plan ahead. It's also nearly impossible to start a 5 tile structure in one turn and finish it the next, because the other players will prevent that.

"Overall, Einstein is a neat little game! I personally really like the spatial and geometric components of the game (which is good, because that’s the core of it), but it’s probably a bit light for me given the amount of analysis paralysis inherent to it. That said, I am happy to play this game, as long as people are okay with me hustling them a bit on their turns to finish quickly. I think it’s a great game for a Casual imprint (which it is), and I think it’s a wonderful game to get people into tile-laying / geometric games (especially given the odd geometries of the tiles). It would probably make for an excellent family game, as well, especially given the light / whimsical nature of the subject matter. If you’ve got a group that plays quickly (or doesn’t mind a timer) or you’re looking to introduce someone to tile games, Einstein’s a … smart choice!"

I like the art and comic/rule book, but game play is a bit simplistic. While I'd gladly play this again (if only to continue reading the historical facts on the cards), I imagine it's a game that one would tire of easily after repeated plays.

This game has a certain beauty about it.  I don't think it has wide appeal among my friend's though.  It's not challenging enough for serious gamers but then the spacial aspect can make it quite daunting for newer gamers.

First play trough with 3 players. The scoring range was very broad (32-47-55). I assume it will be better as a two player game. The components are excellent and the idea is brilliant. Just wish it was more balanced.

Only played Twice yet, and both times Green player (Prime) won. Dunno if it's a coincident or if it's easier to win with that player. 

There is a lot of randomness in this game, and less strategy. 

The common goal cards are too easy to fulfill so the game seems to mostly end when they run out. In both our games so far they run out way before anything else. That they are easy also adds to the randomness.

I appreciate the tactical and puzzley nature of the game. Nice and quick and I like the Einstein theme. Didn't care for the king-making potential in giving other players star points. Not sure I understand the decision behind the tile colors/shapes but it isn't an especially pretty game. Not a keeper but I'd play it again.

I've played communal tiling games before, they they tend to be brinkmanship, solitaire, or mindless.  This game narrowly avoids all three of those shortcomings.  It's pretty, fast, mildly strategic, and satisfying.  There is limited meaningful interaction, but the award for helping other players makes you feel invested despite lack of agency over interaction -- good for a quick casual game.

Also, the board is really pretty -- every tile has a unique chalkboard pattern that string together to make an elaborate bizarre diagram that looks like Einstein is summoning Cthulhu.

caveat:  I helped a little with development, to properly price the pattern cards.

update:  multi-player, this was not very good.  It was too hard to plan and too random if you participated in sharing.  Best with 2.

Played with my partner and we enjoyed the game very much. We both liked the kind of puzzle aspect to the game. He is very good at spatial problems, and while that's not always my strong suit I did very well up until the very last tiles I had to place. We will definitely be playing this one again. This is one I think people I know who don't often play board games might also find kind of fun.

An interesting game that I would be willing to play again. I like the look of the tiles on the table. I also like the biographical facts about Einstein that are printed on the cards.

A really enjoyable spacial puzzle that was much more difficult to play than expected. We always want the game to go longer than it does to complete more of the puzzles.

The production quality is fantastic and the little stars are so cute!

It probably makes a decent two-player game, but with more it has all the usual problems of multi-player placement games of this sort, and does little to try to solve them. (Getting points for players using your pieces to complete private cards is not enough.)

RATING: 7
I have some experience with 3 other titles previous to my first play of this (mostly FitL) and understand how the system works so this wasn’t hard to pickup. My opponent was fresh though, so I spent about 30 minutes getting him up and running which is better than FitL. CT isn’t hard to teach; there are no LoCs, and it strips out the multi-levels of support among other things without adding too much (new tracks as locations is an interesting twist that I had not seen in *earlier* volumes I'd played). The biggest things that I think are interesting about the game (mechanically) are the “do first, then select” instead of the traditional “pick a row, then do the action” and how initiative changes who goes first on what turn. On the first one; in every other COIN game, you pick your row and then do the action. In CT, that’s flipped so you can’t do an OP-Only turn to stiff your opponent with either a lim-op or passing if you only select 1 space. That means as the French player, you have to spend at least 4 resources a turn to force your opponent into that lim-op position. That adds up fast and puts you in a bind where you have to pass just to accomplish something when you don’t have initiative. Second, initiative changes allow you do to back to back turns effectively in so far as you can do the lim-op for one space as a setup, and then do a bigger turn by going first. Otherwise without this effect, you end up doing something (sweep a space) and they undo it (rally in place), and then you do something else, and they undo that and it’s an unproductive grind of resources and card rounds. Nothing wrong with that, but it’s nice to have another option to strategically balance action prioritization.

Other than that, I find there are a number of rough edges from earlier volumes that have been sanded down here. That everyone’s critters go to casualties instead of just one factions is nice as it adds some thought into resource/critter management other than “Rally!!!!!” and throwing bodies at the wall. Sure, there are thematic reasons for all of the changes (and Brian has really thought out how to represent those; the terror change in particular makes sense to me), it’s just nice that mechanically they work as well. Actually, the only downside to the game I can see right now is that the loss of 4p dynamics of fleeting partnerships is what I miss from other volumes. To that point, I think one of the trade offs is that you now are less engaged in keeping everything balanced between players so much as now just trying to advance your cause. That’s a different feel. One thing I noticed was that you’re looking at a touch point every card, so you’re getting about twice as many actions/turns (on average) per propaganda round. That means that you’re looking at a full 3 prop game being approximately 30 turns compared to almost 15 in earlier volumes. That felt like I could dedicate more time to long term strategy in non-critical ways compared to other volumes where I can still plan out what I want to accomplish, but my objectives per arc of the story (in this instance, roughly once every prop round) are much smaller than they are in CT. Compound this with the earlier note about finagling back to back turns and I think this entry in the series helps promote that sort of non-event planning (which is where the series shines IMHO).

Got via P500 August 2017 - read rules and changes from 4 player COIN seem minor. Like the fact that only one card is visible at a time and initiative track seems an interesting idea too.

Primer juego de la serie COIN de GMT Games que está diseñado para solo 2 jugadores (no 3 o 4 como la mayoría).
Como el resto de COINs tiene unos bots excesivamente complejos, si bien en este se puede utilizar mejor que en otros.
Tengo que probarlo más para dar una opinión más consolidada.

My favorite of the COIN games.  Being involved in every card play gives far more control than in the 4 player games, in which you can be tossed about at sea for extended periods.  Playing events allows retention of initiative, and this incentive to play them injects added historical flavor to the game.

This is a very educational game. If you wanna know what police does in a state of civil unrest, what it has in common with terror and how the whole thing works in relation to the average population play this game.

RATING: 8
At the heart of Colonial Twilight is an initiative track that is both its gamiest and its cleverest element.  Why can't I execute that event if you chose a limited op ahead of me?  Why can't I choose a limited op as well? That's the initiative track.  It's clever because it obliges players to weigh the value of a more effective turn now against going first next turn; the value of preventing your opponent from using a powerful event against the less than ideal action you are then obliged to take.

The opposing sides play very differently.  The French are highly mobile and their troops pack a powerful punch.  However, they wear down as the game progresses and the ebbing commitment of the French public diminishes both resources and victory points.  The FLN move slower and have fewer resources, but more of them come back when you knock them down.   Both sides want the support of the people.  Both sides are capable of acts of terror that have their benefits, but also harden public opinion.  The FLN wants bases, the French want to destroy them.  Control of territory is only a means to those ends.  The end goals are pretty clear, but the route to achieving them is full of twists, turns and traps.

Production quality is to GMT's best standards.  The box artwork is striking, while the board is good looking and functional.  My one criticism is of inadequate description on some of the cards of what an event does or how long an effect lasts.  The rules are fine.

RATING: 9
Really, really good. I've enjoyed my one other COIN play, Fire in the Lake, but had barely any idea what the others were capable of doing, much less were actually doing. Going down to 2P makes both sides eventually understandable. Really like the initiative system, and maybe even the blind draw of the upcoming event. I'm partial to 2P wargames in general, but I could see this being the best the system has to offer so far. Moving on up to a 9 after a second play!

RATING: 5
Disappointing as far as the ability of the French to actually win.  I have played 4 opposed games as the FLN with another experinced COIN player, and the FLN won each time, usually by the 2nd Propaganda card.  We both agreed it may be impossible for the French player to win if they don't play the pivotal events perfectly timed, and may be broken if played differently than it was playtested (which we think is with strict pivitol event play).   I think the 2-player mechanic is brilliant and would like to see it in more COIN games.

COIN goes next, higher level. After couple of mediocre entries (Liberty or Death, Falling Sky) series back to modern counterinsurgency, where it belongs. Another factor is opening new gate, as 2-player game is introduced.
In short - core brilliant design of COIN was enriched by clever Initiative pentagon track, which drives both players activities. Both players are eligible on every card, so game swings to more activities and tension. Tension is also added with fact, that we know only current card, so game change into "risk management" play. More events are played, more Momentums also. Pivotals played as a jokers in our hands.
Game has rich narrative and random deck creation adds almost unlimited replayability and you have guarantee, that every game will be different.
Some level of historicity is preserved, playability is great. Brian Train confirms with this design, that COIN is "his" sandbox type of games, where his skills shines most bright.
Great, great game.

One play in, results are generally positive. I'm generally not a fan of the COIN series, but here I think it works because the designer realized that trying to shoehorn 4 sides into a fundamentally two-sided conflict was a bad idea. By making the game two-player, he not only eliminated some potentially bizarre victory conditions (Liberty or Death, anyone?) he also effectively dealt with my main gripes with the COIN series, which is both downtime for each player and the horrendous overall playing time in general.

Our first game came in under 4 hours, and that was after going through most of the deck and drawing the 5th Propaganda card. With that sort of playing time, you still get decent depth with some real tension while making difficult decisions. The various tracks give the FLN multiple paths to dink and dunk their way to victory, nibbling away at the French commitment through various means, but they have to have a plan, and avoid stand-up fights when possible. Meanwhile the French player has lots of resources, but the longer the conflict goes, the more public support will sag, so even onboard accomplishment might not be enough because the floor is dropping out from under them at home.

Anyway, this feels like a pretty tight and well put together game. I'm not surprised given that this actually the designer's second game on the subject, so I think he knows his stuff by now.

On a side note, the game [i]Ici c'est la France[/i] provided a similar experience overall but was far too long and too gritty to hold my interest.

Weight: heavy
Players: 2
Length: around 3 or 4 hours
Mechanics: this is a COIN
Decisions: a lot wouldn't be enough
Opinion: well, a COIN for 2 players.
At first glance the theme is not appealing to me, the independence of Algeria. But this is a COIN for 2 players, and I love COIN games.
And the game is amazing. First of all I must say that some other COINs have some faction forced into the gameplay, they should be for 2 players, but there are a couple more factions to be played by 4.
In this case we have only 2, the angst of playing just 1 time each 2 turns is over, but the rest of things from COIN games are there. Should I go for the event or for the Operations?
How this is solved in the game is nice too, when you choose your action you leave a couple of options to your opponent, so you still have to decide well which one go for.
And regarding the factions, it seems that the French are powerful, but Algerians are almost everywhere, seeing very well how this kind of fights are in real life

Initial rating based on partial game, solo (playing both sides, not with the bot).  I really like the mechanics in the game, and these are probably the best components in a GMT game that I've seen (the counters are still pretty blah, but the embossed pieces for the guerillas more than make up for it).   Game play seems to model insurgency well, capturing the "whack-a-mole" type of efforts in trying to conduct the counter-insurgency.  There are so many decisions to make that it can seem overwhelming to play, but the detailed example of play helped to show how the game can work.  Like any good game of this type, the limits on resources and available actions really force the players into tough decisions as there is more to do than they can in each turn.

This is my first COIN game, and I'm liking it.

French M, Algerian COIN: played vs Paul. I was the Govt, he the insurgents.  He got a good card on first turn which, combined with a lucky dice roll took 6 of my French troops off the map  until after the first scoring round.  

I struggled back, slowly whacking his troops, killing his bases (which increased my vp from commitment), and trying to clear certain sectors and contain his spread (as the insurgents could move freely within a sector), and to harvest support / stamp out opposition.  I was running on minimal cash - the Govt actions are very expensive, with no way to raise funds mid round, and in the second round I was  activating cards to keep the initiative, which payed off well for me with cheap impact (albeit at the cost of giving Paul full actions + specials each time, although his money was tight so he needed to fundraise /extort most of the time).  

We called it after 2 of 3 propaganda cards were out.  I was 5 points from victory, he was 12 - so I won.

Interesting to see a 2 player take on COIN games.  No forecasting of cards increases the randomness.  It avoids the bash the leader issue with COIN games, although as with all, the nuances of play style required in each need to be learned.  Good game, but not particularly interested in the period of history. Solo would be easier than in 4p COIN - just having one AI to manage.

This game has pretty well consumed my thoughts since playing it.  There never seems to be a good move available, and having to balance offense with defense with denial with opportunism is torturous.  I've lost twice out of twice now with FLN, and I'm thinking I probably need to play against the bot to pick up some tricks.

Dec '17: Hard to play based on what I know of this dirty war. I was the FLN, and did particularly badly. A card that helped the French on the France track helped them a lot, but we went into turn 3 with a 30 to 5 resource advantage, and JeroenD thought it better to stop. Not sure what I would do different, except focus more on terror, I suppose, but my lack of efficiency in combat really hurt. Loved the action selection mechanism for two. Not knowing the next card made it stressful, for sure. And the OAS card seemed simply too far out of reach for me to use, given my dearth of resources to spend. Anyway, enjoyed it, but not sure how to do better.

[b]#7 Colonial Twilight: The French-Algerian War, 1954-62[/b]
1-2 players

GMT´s COIN Series Game #7, designed by [person=1678][/person]

This latest installment in GMT’s popular COIN Series system is the first to be designed for two players.

November 1st, 1954: On the eve of All Saint’s Day, armed members of the Front de Liberation Nationale arose in revolt across Algeria against the French colonial government. The authorities suppressed these first incidents quickly, but this date marked the beginning of an eight-year war that saw hundreds of thousands of casualties, widespread atrocities and reprisals, political and social turmoil, and the effective end of the French Empire.   

COLONIAL TWILIGHT takes 1 to 2 players into the tangled web of military and political actions comprising this anti-colonialist struggle. 

The Insurgent, starting from modest beginnings, must build massive and enduring popular support for his cause, and organize to assume power when Algeria finally gains its independence.

The Government, representing both the colonial authorities and France’s military leadership, must engage the nationalist insurgency decisively while striving to preserve the support and commitment of the civilian government and society. 

Players will enter the “heart of darkness” as they use military, political, and economic actions and exploit events to build and maneuver forces to influence or control the population or otherwise achieve their aims along the twisting route to independence. Subversion, torture, factionalism, coups d’etat, forced resettlement, foreign sanctuaries, ambushes, “neutralization”… the whole grim catalog of a pitiless war is there, with a political and moral legacy that French society is only now beginning to confront.

How to turn a 4-player COIN into a 2-player, explained by the designer:

RATING: 7.5
This is my 2nd COIN game and this is an early review, so take everything with a grain of salt. That said, it is a lot of fun. The asymmetrical stuff shines, as with all the COINS, with both sides each having their advantages.  (It's also cool that it's a 2-player COIN, for those of us who have a hard time getting 4 people together). The French have lots of mobility but they're stretched thin. The Algerians are annoyingly hard to eliminate. Me and my buddy were both playing badly but we're starting to figure out what we shouldn't be doing. I think. The rules are medium clear with a few slightly confusing elements. The pieces are pretty (except for those tiny little chits, but I can live with those). The history on the cards is awesome. I'm somewhat familiar with the struggle (and I teach history) so I was a fairly critical reader and I was really impressed. The flavor text really adds to the sense of time and place.

My favorite COIN game.  Perfect for the solo player.  With one AI to manage the game plays quickly compared to other COIN games.  I feel I have more control in this game, with the smart new initiative track that opens up more options for the COIN player.  The France and Border Zone tracks work very well in their abstraction and add a simple, but effective element to the game.  As usual, the GMT components are first class.  [youtube=1UiD84CpmRk]

While I miss some of the political cajoling and wildness of the COIN Series' four-player offerings, Colonial Twilight proves that the series can handle two-sided squabbles with near-equivalent assurance. It's also an excellent take on the bitterness of wars of independence and the international aspects of the Algerian War.

Meh. I played 4 or 5 games. The Gov't won the first one. After that, the FLN dominated simply by pretty much Rallying in place. I think the Events have to fall the Gov't's way for them to win. Still, it's COIN, so it leaves you feeling you could always do better. Plus, the two player mechanic is brilliant.

The initiative system is slick and inventive, while players of previous COIN will have no trouble jumping in. The shift to blind event draws and scant forces on the ground really magnifies the tension. Unfortunately, I don't see many decisions to be made. Those that I have played with felt that FLN play was rather dull, feeling they needed to Rally 90% of the time. I wonder if most insurgent factions in COIN are this straightforward, but we don't notice in the context of four players clamoring to act. 

The feedback from my opponents is that the  event deck is a disappointment. Many of the events are a dry move this track up or down or add and subtract resources. Overall, this game feels far more like an operational game than a CDG. In my last game, we likely played 10 events total over 3 campaigns. Eventually it felt like the deck was only a time-keeping mechanism to determine the length of campaigns. Three events in a row were some variation on +1d6 resources for a faction or -1d6 resources.

COIN game for two players. I was skeptical at first, but the way Brian Train has managed to simplify the design to accomodate the reduced number of players is just brilliant. One example for all: the new initiative track, which is excellent. It falls a little bit short of the best examples of the series, but not by much.

Finally a 2-player COIN. Good choice of topic for it.

A 2-player COIN game would have to suck really bad for me not to love it. Colonial Twilight's conflict is previously unexplored to me and it's lovingly crafted by a designer who just doesn't have half-hearted in his vocabulary. The Algerian War of Independence COIN immediately takes its rightful place in the top three games I have played.

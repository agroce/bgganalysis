RATING: 4
Refreshing theme that fit the mechanics well. I fail to understand why some can find the theme to this objectionable but will happily play, e.g. a wargame. The main problem is the randomness of the appearance of the Emira. If they suit your goal and strategy, great. Otherwise be prepared to be bored by the tediousness of the actions and length of the game.

Based on my first playing the game seems overly long as well as too luck ridden.  The event cards seem to have been put in place to try to mitigate the luck but even with the event cards it still feels I have a lack of control over what princesses will show on the game board that match my best attributes.  It seems almost a forgon conclusion who the pricess will go to and soon as she is revealed taking away some of the "gaming" aspect of the game.  The game components area really well done, though the player aid card seems to have omitted the amount it takes to look for and buy an event card.  I would be willing to play a couple of more times to see if my first impression changes.

Provoking theme in a way. Which means I like it. However my version of the game is completely in German, so will take me a while before I get my act together and read through the rules (my German language skills are a bit rusty, haven't flexed them for eight years). But I'm looking forward to playing this, despite what I've heard about it coming down to luck.

Not a game I ever expected to play.  Non-PC but provided some amusement, if not much of a game.  Two of five players including me decided to major on good looks.  Throughout the whole game not one maiden was interested!  They all preferred the money and purple cards.  That's life I guess.  So, a pretty pointless experience.  I accept that was down to an unusual card distribution, but a design should be able to eliminate such occurrences.  Would play again if pushed, but there are so many better games to play I doubt our gaming group would be repeating the experience.

Bit of a fuss made over the theme of this game - quite misplaced in my opinion. I think its visually stunning and beautifully realised design allied to good mechanics makes this a far better game than many realise. And it's not turned me into a raving misogynist either!

I enjoy auction games...however, I didn't enjoy the auction aspect in Emira.  Played once as a five player game with the rules explained to me.  After the first 2 hours I really wanted this game to end.  I probably will not give it a second try.  I would much prefer to play Princes of Florence.  I have little to no interest in playing this game again... unless the game was slightly modified to reduce the luck factor, such as having the princess deck separated into a top, middle, and bottom deck with an even distribution of desired attributes.

I quite like this - but it needs people to play at a reasonalble pace.

Feels a bit like Princes of Florence where you have a number of options to pick from each turn, but here you bid for the right to pick first and then have to pay list price, rather than purely auction something.

Biggest issue I have is the randomness of the princesses - for example if you've gone down the "improve status" route and none of them are interested in that, too bad ...

Not sure it really works with 3 - with more you'll likely to see 2 people competeting in each area of interest.

Standard economic game where you set up your income production (in the form of spice caravans and camels) and then buy the things you need to win the game.  The standard tension between building up more buying power vs. getting things that actually score points is nice, but mechanism to get there is so unbelievably tedious.  Lots and lots of auction rounds where it is difficult to properly value things so you spend a lot of turns just buying more income / bidding power waiting for the right woman or resource to show up.  Takes way too long for the amount of enjoyment it provides and doesn't bring anything new to this style of game.  Not a bad game necessarily, but it isn't as good as several others I have that are very similar.  Unlikely to ever play this one again.

This is a frustrating game. By all rights, it should be really, really good.  The theme is wonderful, the Emira cards are great in that each of the Princesses has some personality, and the tension between raising cash and doing stuff that will actually win the game is great (I love the caravans).

But it isn't, and the reason is pacing. Not enough happens each turn. You do all this bidding and game-state-maintainance and you just don't get enough out of it; the amount of time spent making decisions is almost as great as the amount of time spent fiddling the pieces. Then with only one Princess becoming available, the game can potentially take forever. Or quite a long time anyway.

When a game comes this close, and yet still manages to miss by so much, it's particularly aggravating.

RATING: 4
[17/8/06]A workman-like design, which sports the classy artwork gamers have come to expect from Phalanx Games - though gameplay often seems to fall short of the topnotch components provided.For what it is, I'm afraid Emira takes longer than it ought to. Chief culprits for holding up the game are the event cards and the bookkeeping. However, this wouldn't bother me, were it not for the fairly pedestrian gameplay. The auctions in this game tend to lack the excitement these typically bring to the table.The event cards vary too greatly in their usefulness and I have to echo the René's opinion of them having a fairly tacked on feeling to them.The game encourages too great specialisation. This leads to players taking - a sometimes irreversible - lead in the qualities the ladies desire. Other players' investment in the same area might thus be entirely pointless and correspondingly competition suffers. It is regrettable that the harem ladies don't have a broader outlook. Emira would greatly benefit from this as players wouldn't be railroaded into their special 'field of expertise' and therefore open up more strategic approaches, hike up competition and avoid anti-climactic endgames.I'm tempted to alter the ladies' interests so as to take into account 2nd placed players in their main interests, while also giving points for the secondary and remaining interests.Furthermore, our group has resolved that the game would gain greater depth by uncovering the next turn's harem lady.Emira is one of those games, which cannot fulfill the promise its original and fun theme and core engine holds. Emira's a solid game and I enjoyed playing it - particularly given the fun table talk this game's bound to generate.Emira might have become a classic had it benefitted from more thorough gameplay development work (e.g. by Hans im Glück).

Advance your sheik in appearance, status, wealth and enlargen his palace to attract a number of princesses to your palace. Some can be helpful, some can plain steal from you but you need them to win. You bid for the right to choose which action to take first. This can be spice caravans increasing your income or appearance, status, palace sections or camels which each help you on your way to attracting the princesses. Event cards allow you to tinker with each different aspect of the game but you first have to shell out some Gold to buy them which is key to the game. 4 Plays.

Based on 1 (incomplete) play with 3 players. There's some good that can be said about Emira. It has a funny, rich, well-fitting theme, gorgeous art, and a good amount of strategy. It could be a good game but unfortunately its faults really do mar the experience. The biggest problem is its length. Before we quit over two hours had passed. Sure we were learning, but two   hours is a little ridiculous for a strategy game when there are so many better ones that you can play in that amount of time. Moreover, certain rounds in the game (like the bidding) were identifiably more drawn out and boring than others. It really feels like the designer could have done something to shorten the game but didn't.

Rated off one play

Good component production quality, but the game was let down by me by being essentially luck based, while trying to masquerade as a heavier game.  In our game there was basically a series of princesses coming out who basically all wanted the same main attribute, and it seemed as if once someone had the lead in this, it was very difficult to catch them:  Really you're looking at 2 people competing for each attribute, and if there is only one attribute type coming up there is nothing the other players can do about it.  Also the unbalanced start for the players genuinely seemed that: Unbalanced.  I have no interest in playing this again.

Fun easy to learn game with nice graphics and 'interesting' theme. Play is similar to Princes of Florence. The event cards also make for some nice variety/strategy. Unfortunately, all the bidding and buying phases make the game way too long for what it is. The slighty male-centric theme could be off-putting for some.

A boring Princes of Florence lookalike published in the latter days of the Golden Era of eurogaming. The subject is admittedly fun and has been kept very clean, but it cannot hide that it is simply all about bidding for limited resources and hoping that a semi-randomly aquired string of goods meets with a semi-randomly drawn set of symbols. Adding insult to injury, the emiras simply walk into your palace if you happen to be the most eligible sheik, even if they cause you nothing but grief. I found that the game simply offers too little variety to remain interesting over the length of time it takes to play. There is little creativity in piecing together what little strategical matter is contained in this title: the older Princes forces much more decisions upon you, and in a shorter timeframe too. Perhaps in the days it was published it was worth playing due to a lack of proper alternatives—at the time of writing (2012) this argument does not hold anymore (Yedo, Homesteaders, Goa, to name but a very few). Emire ought to be allowed to sink into the grey murk of forgetfulness.

I also cannot help but giggle inanely at the thought of prudes having a problem with this game. The artwork has been kept extremely clean, and even the word 'sex' has been replaced with the much more clinical 'libido'. There are a few small jokes hinting at certain adult activity, like the emira who keeps you out of the subsequent round due to a 'honeymoon', but that is really all there is to it. If you have a problem with the concept of a harem, then I expect you to have problems with starvation, combat, extortion, strange gods, assassination, and more as well for me to take your complaint seriously.

Great theme. I enjoyed this game but it's quite the slog.

1. Unless you really set yourself up right in the beginning with a bunch of crops, be prepared for hideous cash-strappedness as you try and accomplish anything during a given round.

2. Very random. The Emira draw alone can completely disenfranchise 2-3 players per game. The one game of this I played was, according to its owner, the fastest they had ever seen. This was due to an almost constant draw of women favoring palaces, who fell one after the other into one of the player's laps (literally and figuratively).

3. The auctions are brutal. In the five player game I played, 2-3 players per turn were being brutally railroaded into sub-optimal auction situations and/or being prevented from getting the resource they wanted turn after turn.

Cool theme, nice production, tough, cut-throat game. Probably not for everyone.

  Feels very well-balanced.  Seems very replayable - your strategy depends far more on what your opponents are doing than on what options are coming up.

Many people refuse to play because of the theme.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00]House Rules (which I believe you need to make the game worth playing at all):[/BGCOLOR]

- There is queue of princesses. You see the princess active this turn plus the next two.

- Action cards which refer to top 3 cards of princess deck, are considered to refer the 3 visible princesses

- Action cards which refer to the top card of the princess deck, are considered to refer to the next princess in the queue after the active princess

- To shorten things, use 5 player goal cards when playing with 4 players. Also, this game really benefits from someone acting as sort of a metronome to keep things moving ('Ok, now it's your bid, now yours.'). This is not a game to play with slow players.

Nice bits, simple enough choices, looooong game. We quit after 3.5 hours including the rules reading, 2 players had 2 princesses, 1 player had 1 and 2 had none. So it was about half an hour a round. There is so much money counting, the costs are very high, the rich get richer, it all takes so very long. Nice bits, nice ideas, but almost no interaction, a long bidding process working out what you can afford to buy, what you can bid, what discount you have. And they use the crappiest auction method, go round, pass and you're out, the longest boringest bidding mechanism there is. The game mechanisms are all separate and badly organised. Discounts are shown as positive and go up instead of negative and go lower. You can't trade anything, everything is counted in 100s for no reason. You could knock a zero off everything and it would just be easier to do the sums. So many things annoyed me, especially knowing a German game editor would make the game tighter and faster. The rules even say shuffle the deck, deal cards and then Note: first remove these cards. AAAARGH! So many things could be improved, it seems like they took the prototype and published that. Great artwork, ridiculously overlong game. How it's got such a high rating beats me. People must enjoy suffering.

The auction part does indeed remind me of Princes of Florence (PoF).  In PoF, the auction round is followed by an action round.  In Emira the only player choices post auction are the purchase of a card.  Following this the princess chooses her 'prince' and the game continues with a new round.

It can be luck (good or bad) that a certain princess joins a particular palace.  It might be that someone is strong in one category and the random emira card each round just happens to match.   There just aren't enough choices to allow the player to mitigate these type of occurances.

The game is overly long considering the limited choices.  PoF plays in 7 rounds and this creates added tension.  In Emira there is no tension.

Screw the political correctness of today's world. I like this game and am not afraid to say so. The game does seem a bit sloppy, in it's executions and the game time, on the box is way off. This is a long game, but once you get the hang of it. It can be a lot of fun, if your willing to put the time into it and play a few games, to get the hang of things. I'll never understand all the uptight people looking for something to complain about. I'd rather just sit back and have fun and I can do that with this game. I just wish, that more people could accept the fact, that not all people and cultures are the same and could just sit back and have fun and get along.

If your a woman, who has a man who thinks he'd love to have a harem, of various types of women living under the same roof as he. Then have him play this game once and the thought will be forever erased from his mind. Lmao, to fun!!! :laugh:

Simple and less interesting version of Princes of Florence.

Overly long, rich-get-richer syndrome, no way to catch up.

Aside from auctions (which are rigged, since rich-get-richer, poor-stay-poor), no meaningful choices.
Once your are in a certain "strategic path to victory", you are locked in and you cannot do anything else, problem being here that there are only three paths, and due to the nature of the game a path is monopolized by exactly one player.  In a four or five player game, this means that one or two players are virtually eliminated after a few turns.  And then the game drags on for 3 hours.

Great game with a nice theme, but I can't understand that it will offend anyone. My fears that the auctions wouldn't work wasn't right. True that the draw of the ladies can give a little too much luck to a single player, but it doens't really matter for me. But I have to buy an English version, as it's painful to understand the German cards and it's quite a lot of reading. Though I doubt it will work as a 5-player game.

Similar to Princes of Florence in that you are bidding for different "resources" which enable you to gain what amounts to victory points, but the game just plays too long.

The theme makes this game and is the reason why I bought it. Although there would not be much of a game without the auctions, they strike me as a simple solution to counterbalance the randomness regarding which princesses show up. There is almost no control over that, thus the event cards that change their order or preferences feel a little overpowered. However, the main flaw is that the game is too long. Only with three players it is kept at a reasonable duration, but the required rule changes for that number are quite fiddly. Those small problems prevent it from getting to the table more often, but I enjoy it when it does. The artwork is a plus, with a different picture for every princess.

Okay it's another of those interesting concept games, but it's not quite as much fun as we hoped.  Though it is an interesting concept of seducing Princesses and trying to build up the resources for it, it's not exactly a perfect game.

It's hard to put a finger on it but it felt like there's something missing from it.  There is the potential for fun in the game, but it just seems that the game itself is only half a concept and that the rest of the game is to be released later or something.

It's long alright. If someone comes up with a reasonable way of speeding the game up so it can be played reliably in 90 minutes I'll keep it otherwise it's off to the tradelist. Too bad, it's a good game. A second (3player) game started off slow, but found speed somewhere in the middle and just ran to completion in what felt like no time.

It's almost there, but there are some definate problems.  There are fewer interesting choices to be made as the game goes on to it's long drawn-out end.  It's possible to make no real decision for 10 or 15 minutes at a time except to make jokes about why there are no women that like men with the most camels.

Emira has an interesting theme and, like most Phalanx games, is attractively presented. However, the game itself is a disappointment. Perhaps the most serious failing of the game is that, as the game progresses, meaningful player choices become increasingly restricted. Each player needs to set his or her long-term strategy (principally whether to specialise in either attractiveness or status) early in the game. From then on, choices mainly have a lesser, short-term effect. In the later stages of the game, the player strategies having long been set, the main factor influencing the result is the order of the emira cards. The event cards add a further random element to the game. Given this, and the rather repetitive nature of the turns, the game length is excessive. The multiple bidding rounds per turn are the most guilty party in dragging out the proceedings.

Great theme and wonderful artwork. There, that's the good bits taken care of.

How did this monstrosity ever get published?! Imagine Princes of Florence, only 5-10 times slower and without any semblance of balance, and you have Emira. Bad rich-get-richer syndrom: You can see who is going to win but with the speed this game unfolds, you can also see that it will take *hours* for the inevitable to happen... Add a fair dose of randomness and you end up with an absolutely horrible mixture. Like watching a glacier move. Yikes.

Another game were the shuffling of the cards often determines the winner. If the same requirements come on the first four or five princesses the sheik that starts in the lead in that requirement will win. In our latest the white sheik started with the largest palace and the first four princesses wanted the largest palace. He was also the starting player. He won in four turns. We didn’t even play out the forth turn since no one could prevent the princess from choosing him.

RATING: 7.5
I like this a bit better than Princes of Florence.  So far I'd say it's one of the best auction type games I've played.  However, there's some flaws:

1) Just a bit too random.  With the blue cards, random princesses, and random "status" cards it just is too random.

2) too much screwage factor.  I can appreciate that the blue cards (forget the name) are meant to balance, getting hit with several in a row just sets the game back too much.

3) too long.  This comes from 1 & 2.  No matter how well you play, it can drag too, too long.  It might have just been the first play.  It may just be bad luck.  


I want to play this one a few more times.  I have to admit I find the theme a bit amusing, although I feel guilty for it.  I like the mechanics, mostly.  I think this could be a great game with some tweaking, but I'm at a loss to what that tweaking would be. 

I wish it was cheaper. 

* Playing it with 5 players seems to help, completing in a much more reasonable time frame.

The striking theme about harem-building piques the interests of most players, but the actual game turned out to be pretty dry. Players spend turns bidding to improve themselves on different fronts (bigger palace, more camels, better dressed) in order to attract the Emiras. 

Playing with the variant of seeing future princesses made the game much more interesting, as did single-round bidding. For a game with such an unusual theme, its a shame that there wasn't more to it aside from the methodical process of each round.

Emira looks promising at first with interesting auction mechanics and things to do but it turns out to be too long and has a runaway leader problem. First get trade routes and a camel, then get the prestige cards. Whoever does this simple procedure best should win. This assessment is based on one play so I may be wrong. If anyone does not understand the importance of money early they are in for a long boring game.

Extremely tight action selection game with a lot of bidding. Oddly enough just about the only thing you don't bid on are the ladies you are trying to fill your harem with. Unfortunately, loses points due to the random nature of certain aspects of the game and the inflexibility of having only one action per turn. There is almost no chance to react to the available princesses, if a princess shows up who will go to whomever has the most castles, whoever already had the most castles will win, as with only one action per turn, it is impossible to challenge whoever already had the most camels/castles/looks/status/money unless you were only one behind that person.

Rating based on one 4 player game only:
Not too shabby.  Alot of laughs, alot of fun (which is much of the point of gaming, is it not?!) and an overall decent experience.
The game lasted a tad too long.  And getting through the rules initially was a bear.  But the game flowed very well after a round or so, and all of us felt like we knew what we were doing and what we wanted to accomplish.
I squeeked out vuctory from the jaws of defeat and agreed with some of the rampant comments about luck playing a fair role.  I may use the variant suggested about splitting the Emira deck in two equal halves and shuffling them seperately, then placing on top of each other.
All in all, a good game though.  I probably won't hit the table often, but was well received and requested again already for a follow-up to our strategies...

RATING: 5
A good game that makes use of several game mechanics, however the mechanic that is felt the most, is the bidding for turn / action order. However, after playing this game, i felt that the bidding action was getting a little boring, as you have at least 3 bidding rounds per turn - however, i was personally not able to think of a better way of determine the action selection order, so will just enjoy the game :-)
The theme is well represented in this game, you really feel like you are building yourself (and your household) in order to improve yourself.
While i didnt love this game, i definitely enjoyed it and would definitely be willing to play if someone asked - having said that, i would not be my game of choice.

Strategic auction game with a few twists. The theme is certainly original and inviting. Make sure not to get too low on cash or otherwise you won't be able to pay for the maintainance of your princesses. The most important and rather crucial negative element is the game length (5-player game lasted almost 5 hours). A shorter game would be more enjoyable and might have hit the table again. ****** Played a prototype during a session of the Belgian Multijeux tournament in 2004 (title of the game at that moment: Harem).

there's lots going on so several plays are needed to assess how good you view the game (provided it's your type of auction/victory points kind of game).  sometimes you can attract a princess when you didn't really intend on winning her favor (which, of course, you now have to pay for her upkeep to retain her/them).  my biggest knock is that the length is too long for what it is and also you are left with really doing nothing when it's not your turn.  also, going early for the camels and caravan seems too strong a strategy for latecomers to overcome.

Interesting premises (economic engine, different strategies, original theme), but the game is disappointing.

Nice artwork.

Good idea - great, fun theme; triggered some of the most entertaining table talk I've ever had the pleasure of engaging in.  BUT...as written, it's marred by an intolerable number of auctions, and the well-documented "specialization" problem in 4-player games.

Want to play again, but will insist on 5 players next time to hopefully mitigate the specialization, plus I want to implement an "Age of Steam"-style auction system for this game rather than the painfully repetitive system it is burdened with.  That way you could have one auction per round rather than the N-1 auctions per round in the game as written.

Still, I want this game to work - the theme, art, etc. are a lot of fun.

RATING: 8
Recently played this game, and have to say, the time given on the side of the box is sadly mistaken. We played almost four hours, when it's an hour and a half. Although this was the first time we played it, Im sure that has a bit to do with it. I still felt this game was a little too heavy for the estimated time given.  I gave this game an eight, mainly because I really liked the bidding section of the game, for example the camel's ability can really help you, but it can also become a crutch and cloud your judgment on a specific item. 
 
Also the aim is of course to obtain the princesses to complete your goal. The princesses themselves are quite a handful. I won the -Xenia- princess, and although I needed her icon, her ability was, every third turn you must pay a 250 gold piece gift to her.  Now in later turns like the eighth or ninth, you'll needed not worry about that, but I received her in the third round of the game., when the most gold I was receiving was about 450 gold a turn. So what do you do in a situation like so. Do you plan ahead, and not bid to save the money for the next two rounds and take a chance on letting a great opportunity slip by, or do you choose to skip your bidding phase, and just take the 150, or do you take a chance on spending the money, and losing her just for the sake of finances?
Regardless of your choice the game is quite a handful, and extremely entertaining.

Played a three player game, once, at 3.6 hours. And a four player game at 3.1 hours. I'm not sure I'd play it again unless some variant was employed to speed it up. There's nothing really wrong with the mechanisms, its just waaaaaay too long for what it is. At first I thought it was us, or something unique to the three player version (which does have a few different rules). But after playing a four player game nothing much changed. I see from the comments here, over a dozen people have complained how long it took to play. And it didn't seem to matter how many were in the game. The box says 75 minutes. Ha! If Emira only took 2 hours I'd rate it higher. --- Update: played again; a three player game. We played with two changes. First, we ignored the special three player rules in the rule book. Second, we shortened the game by using the victory conditions for the next higher number of players. In other words, making the victory conditions easier. This shortened the game to 1:45. Since then I've played using this variant seven more times. So for playing the game with the rules in the box I still rate it a 5. With this variant - a 6.

The theme creates the atmosphere, which is good. However, I am not convinced that it will survive in the long term.

Awesome, great theme! However I have some concerns about the spice tracks, they seem broken at best. The player who gets these on the first round has a massive advantage, and can then get more spice tracks in future rounds (because of the additional income), and then in becomes a vicious circle of the strong getting stronger. I would play again to see if better bidding on the first round could counteract this, but at this point I have a very bitter taste in my mouth about the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
The gameplay works fine and it's rather engaging for the first hour.  After 6 hours it gets kinda tedious.  Honestly the game is broken with 5 players: it plays for far too long.  In fact I didn't even get to finish my only game.  One of the problems is that the victory conditions are too difficult considering you need to have a majority of one type of influence (appearance, size of palace, status or money) to attact a princess. Of course the other players are competing too and there's only one player who can move up in each type of influence per round (whomever wins the bid chooses first).   In a 5-player game there are 4 auctions per round (whoever wins the first auction chooses then the remaining 4 people auction for the remaining choices).  Another problem is that even though you may be ahead in one or two influence/attribute types the current princess may not be interested in what you offer OR if she is she may not have an ability that contributes to your victory condition.  The other problem is you need to spend a lot of rounds (time) generating money (bidding for the spice trail rather than improving your influence).  I may try again once the faults have been addressed.  Great theme and fair design.  Looking foward to what this design team has to offer next.

This is a fun game.

Despite the similarities to Princes of Florence, this game has a bunch more luck in it, but it does it in a fun way.

You have to pretty much decide on a strategy and stick to it (largest palace or best looking, for example), but thanks to the cards you could easily end up with some real nasty princesses in your harem!

Lots of laughs to be had as people realise that they're about to get a "negative" princess!

Don't take this game too seriously and ride the luck (both good and bad) and you'll have a great time with it.

The three-player rules are quite clunky, but it plays really well with four or five.

A politically incorrect game about trying to amass a harem of women who crave different things in their husband lord. This is a bidding game where you need to keep track of who has the most of a certain type of resource when the women decided who they will favor. Cards that help or hinder are thrown in for more strategy.

One play with 5 players - man did this drag on and on. We had the rules down and I made sure to keep things moving, but it still felt endless. There's a lot here to like, though I think there is too much luck in the order the princesses appear (which is even further exacerbated if someone gets a card to change their attributes or alter the order in which they appear). I wound up winning by using a money and palace strategy. Another complaint is that once you decide on a course of strategy, it feels like you're locked in for the game with no hope of competing outside your strengths... which leads to the luck factor I mentioned - you need the right cards to come up so you have a chance to compete for them.

Welcome to auction city. Each turn, each player will get to buy one thing (through auctions) - either an investment in making more money for the future, or purchasing one of the 4 "princess items". Each turn a princess card will be revealed, and that princess will be granted to whoever has the most of the "princess item" that that card wants. Your dilemma is that the game is about winning the most princesses, but you need money to do it. Your problem is that this game has a reverse tension arc. Auctions at the beginning of the game can be interesting as people battle to get their money flow going and declare a first-dom in a princess item or two. As the game develops, tension and interest reduces though - players are well established in the lead in various "princess items" and will be hard-pressed to be hauled back. Then it's almost like you enter a waiting game, going through the motions, to see who gets luckiest - if the princess cards come out quickly in the "princess item" that you have the lead in, happy days. But boring. And not much you can do to change things. Either your princesses come out, or they don't. And this game has a lot lot lot of auctions. That they get boring and kind of irrelevant by the end just prolongs the pain. Disappointing.

TRY Mar/07: Fun game & theme, but too long.  I think the game would be more interesting (and quicker) with 2 emira per round (3 for the double trouble cards) -- it would give multiple objectives to be best in.

I'd also argue that the importance of $ early was huge -- too huge.  I got behind on camels & income, and I was then getting 4th choice each round, which shut me out of the income some more.

I agree with another comment too, that too much time seemed spent on the turn-order bidding and pushing chits, versus strategy.

El juego es excelente aunque a primeras me costaba entender eso de la secuencia del turno par, impar, tal vez su punto débil es que es para 3 jugadores, aunque yo lo probé con 2 y tampoco la pase mal, es lógico que con mas jugadores el juego es mas batallador.

After playing this, we all had a bit the same feeling: why play a bad version of 'The Princes of Florence' when you can play the original which is excellent? The randomness of the princesses screws things up and with 5 the problem seems to be that 1 player goes strong in palaces, on other in status points and a 3rd in appearance. And it's very hard to catch up and impossible to attract a princess. And our gaming group doesn't love event cards!

I really had a great time with this game, despite its problems.  They really had a great idea going here, which makes some of the sloppiness of the execution even more of a shame.  Namely: The starting boards each start with different bonuses, but only one board actually has the bonus printed on it (you need to look at the book for the rest).  Also, many of the cards don't really do what they say: you really must read what the cards do in the book to understand what the cards do.  Additionally some text is simply ignored if you aren't playing the advanced game, but, advanced text rules are not preceeded with "advanced rules only," or anything of that nature.  You must read the card, realize it doesn't make sense with the rules you're playing with, and then disregard the text.  The three player has many additional rules that make it feel quite clunky.  On the upside, though random, the game is fairly balanced.  You are taxed each turn for your ladies (victory points), and the best ladies come with the worst disadvantages.  At it's heart, it's a fun game, but all of these little flaws add up to further increase the already long play time.

Too long for the content. The bidding phase is rather uninteresting, especially as someone with lots of camels will anyway go first with no cost, and often the one getting the next princess is known already before the actions so the game is largely determined by the order of the princess deck.

RATING: 4
Extremely auction heavy Euro game. And this is already the problem with the game, that for the most time you are doing auctions (or some upkeep). You do not just one auction for turnorder, but rather auction of every place in turn order seperately. This is just overkill and the game drags a lot. The other mechanics are decent and it is mainly a game about having the majorities in two main and one minor categorie (looks, status, palace). In a 5 player game one player will probably have problems in competing in the two main categories.

The order in which the cards with ladies show up and the event cards put some luck/randomness in the game. The theme is a bit tongue in cheek (in the end the ladies choose to which Sheik they go) and not really offensive. The components are functional and the art style has some appeal.

Surprisingly fun game based around a sound auction mechanic. More tactical than strategic, but the decisions available to the player are interesting enough.

I'm rather stunned that they were able to get this theme onto the market. The rulebook actually points about a couple times about how, "these women are empowered and have choice of who they stay with" just to cover their asses. Anyway, the mechanics are fine enough, but the game takes too long to play, and its just not fun enough to warrant that.

Certainly a unique gaming experience and an excellent game if judged based on the amount of discussion after the game. The rules seem somewhat fiddly but it all fits quite nicely together once you learn the rules. The only really negativa thing is the long playing time which really is 75 minutes or more. Either it ends at 75 minutes or it takes much longer. Our first game took 3,5 hours. The whole time it was quite exciting though. This definately will come out again but not very often.

Only one play and we even decreased the victory conditions by one wife and the game still went on a long time.  Had we played the full victory conditions I can see it having gone on another 1/2 hour to 45 minutes.  There is quite a bit of game here but the whole process felt very repetitive each turn which is ok in short game but not in a long game.  It seems to be mainly about getting your money engine up and running so you can control the auctions.  Still, someone might manage a quicker win with a little luck.

The theme is kinda silly. Onto the game: The mechanic isn't a bad one, but it needed some tweaking to get the best out of it. I'd like to see a line of ladies face up showing players what they have to work towards if they plan to earn the cards. Without more forward planning the game relies on a healthy dose of luck on the draw and luck with the event cards.

The beginning of the game is the interesting bit, but once the strategies have been chosen turns tick over quickly without much to think about - your path has been set and it's either going to work out or it isn't.

Not a bad effort, but a little disappointed that a solid mechanism wasn't refined into something better.

Bought it at Essen 2007! Finaly I got to play the game. Gameplay does take too long. Our first play lasted  4 hours (including rules explanation). If we had played the official variant it would have been even longer. In the end, it's the variant we played that kept the game alive, and will make sure we play it again some time.

our second play lasted well over three hours... it's getting there but still it's too long.

24-08-08: this was our third play... we played a 4 player game with the 5 player goals. As the first two games; that just takes forever... It's not a bad game, not at all. I can get passed the fundamental flaws this game also has, with a few simple house rules. But I have to address this time issue first. Without that addressed, this game will not be played ever again.

The first few rounds were fun... then you realize that no matter which strategy you aim for, it all comes down to the right girls coming up in the hopeful order you need them. 2 and a half to 3 hours later (5 player game) the winner is more or less determined by luck of the draw. Sigh... it's too bad, the artwork is excellent and I liked the theme. Too bad it's printed on such poor quality stock.... very warped boards. If you're in the mood to play this game, play Princes of Florence instead - you'll get much more game with shorter time involved.

RATING: 6
Resource Management. Interesting game in the mold of Princes of Florence. Where PoF is tight and mathy, Emira is more strongly (if potentially offensively) themed with a cool income mechanic and the variability of event cards. The 75  minute game duration on the box seemed way off for us (~180 minutes) although we had some interruptions. The game has more round-robin turn-taking during each phase than PoF has, which contributes to the lengthier game time and is susceptible to slower players drawing out the game turns.

I'm willing to say that I like this game.  I wasn't sure at first.  It took us 3 hours and 19 minutes to play our first game.  It's only supposed to take a little bit over 75 minutes.  Our three-player game ended in almost a three-way tie.  From what I could tell, the game feels like it was playtested well.  There are special rules for three-player games, and I'm told that the rulebook has some good game examples.  However, this game has something that many other games don't have, and that would be the ripe opportunity to tell lots of stupid jokes and comments.  Many games can be too dry, but this one has a very unique theme.  Beware playing this game with women, especially feminists.

Holy crap this is a long game.  I like long games, but this was just way too long for what it was.  I really wanted to love this and at certain points in the game I enjoyed it, but this absolutely drags with five. 

As everyone builds up their harem, you find your options for the girls that you want dwindles. Much of the game felt like you were locked into one kind of "path to victory", and you cross your fingers hoping that you will win the right cards if they ever come up. A game that relies on this much of a random element for victory would be fine if the game were a half hour or even an hour, but we are talking MANY HOURS.  Perhaps if I played this with less people, the game wouldn't be as long, but I also feel that your position still couldn't be maliable enough to get the girls you need when they appear (although perhaps this could be the case as there is more opportunity to buy the things that you need).  

This game feels like it came straight from the prototype without any kind of playtesting.  I really question whether they tested it to completion with 5 players.

Players are trying to attract a collection of wives to their harem: 5 with specific (secret) traits or 7 total. There are several player attributes (appearance, status, palace size etc). Each round begins by revealing a new emira (bride-to-be) with 1 or 2 traits, who is interested in one of the player attributes. Players bid $ for the right to choose 1 of several things to buy (eg status card, something to improve appearance, something to help earn $ or make auctions easier, etc). In auction order, players make their purchases. At end, emira goes to the player with the best of the thing she likes (eg appearance). Play continues till someone wins!

This was pretty good, although it felt like it went on a bit too long. Another one that is going to need repeat play.

Good god.  The game just takes forever, and not nearly enough happens each turn.  I wonder if it could be fixed with alternate rules, because there are certain aspects I really like.  It takes a couple of good ideas from Funny Friends (another game that takes forever for no reason), but it doesn't do enough to keep me interested.  I won our aborted play (we used a rule that allowed us to count up points and just end it), and I really felt it was a bad experience.  The game might be overall better than a 3, but I just do not want to play it again.  Too many problems.

What you do over the two+ hours of this games has practically no effect on whether you win. Actually, the last game was won by the player who didn't bid at all but took whatever was left over. But the artwork is nice, so Emira scores a bonus point for that.

This game came out in 2006. I played it twice then. I liked it a lot. I had only been playing games for less than a year at that moment. My look on games must have changed. I've become old and grumpy I guess.
This game clearly takes some cues from [thing=555][/thing]. The auction system is almost identical. The way you win is not though. In PoF you get points for completing works. You get more points if you have won the right elements for completing the work. In Emira you win by getting a certain amount of princesses. They come to you if you have won the right elements in the auctions.
The main difference here is that in PoF you have the works in your hand so you can plan ahead and save up to score big.  In Emira on the other hand you have exactly 1 auction to buy 1 thing to get the princess. The problem here is that you might not even have a chance to do so. If you need the biggest palace but are behind more than 1 palace part, there's no way of winning that princess this round. So you don't have nearly as much control over which princesses you can win and when. To make things worse, you also have a mission card. If you have a certain combination of princesses you need less of them to win. But since you don't have much control of which princesses you win - you just take whichever you can get - that just adds even more of a luck factor.
This also takes us to the problem of length. PoF taks 7 turns. Emira ends when a player has a predetermined amount of princesses, depending on the number of players. We played with 5. To win you needed 4 with the mission or 6 without the mission. Since only one princess is distributed each round, that means you will have to go through a lot of rounds since the same player will not win 4 in a row and complete his mission. It just becomes so repetitive. It drags on.
Things are made even worse by the addition of the action cards which add even more chaos to the game.
I was surprised our game only took 90 minutes, but even with that time, it outstayed it's welcome. And I know most plays of this take much longer.
The game also has some production problems. The artwork itself is pretty good, but the design is a bit problematic. The font is horrible and lots of things that should have been icons are text. What's wrong with using the coin icon and putting a value on it to indicate cost? No, let's put that in text. The rules also leave some things unclear and could have been structured much better.
Oh yeah, the theme seems to bother some people. I don't see why. It's just a game you know.
The game has a solid base that was borrowed from one of the best games in existence. And than it piles on top all those things that make the game less than the sum of it's parts and simply not a very good game.

Ooof. what a disappointment. The game looks terrific, with beautiful artwork, but despite some very good early feedback, this game has no tension and several fundamental game-play flaws.  Bidding for turn order is bland (thanks to the camel event cards, we always had the same order of play). The random nature of the Emira card preferences means that you can only hope a princess with the preference you have gone for comes up.  The event cards, and cost of actions are very imbalanced. Reading the rules, the  game seemed to be a nice twist on Princes of Florence. Unfortunately its way off the fine tuned game-play of that classic.

RATING: 5
Looks like a strategy game when you look at it, but after playing the game it doesn't feel like there's a lot of strategy to me.  

Probably the style of play of our group, but it seemed like after a few rounds two people (of a 4 player game) would be far ahead of other players in some area and just keep going that way until the end of the game. (Status 9/8/3/1 by the end) So it ended up being a game of betting on what attribute the princesses will want. If two people have 4 palaces and you have 1 you can't buy enough to change the outcome after a card is revealed. The two people who have already bet that the women will want palaces will fight for the one palace section this round, but anyone else in the game just has the decision of what they want to increase their bet on. (He and I are close on status. I'll buy the status card so that when a girl comes up who wants status she'll come to me) I don't see anything that would discourage people from being a specialist except the players knowing that the game is boring when played in this manner.

Added to the "betting on what the women want" is a luck of the draw problem where you can't control what they're going to give you when you win them. So if you need cooking and the women you are getting give you beauty, then it looks like you're not making the easy goal. Better hope everyone else is in the same boat or you're going to lose.

Also, the betting was boring. With the camels in play everyone just bets their number. (some rounds people said 80 when they had 100 free, but if you said 90, then they would say 100. It's just a mirage) So if they have a 50 camel and you don't then you either pay 60 out of your pocket or they go first. Only a few times did it seem worth it to bid for the right to go first. (If he gets to go first, then he'll pick this thing that will give him the majority in an area and then he'll get the last princess he needs to win) Probably would be better if the camels were cheaper and just gave a 10/20/30/40 discount.

The core mechanic where everyone bids to buy something each round from a very asymetrical selection of improvements, and where everybody is going to get something and bidding is simply for (a very critical) selection order, feels very much like Princes of Florence. However, where Princes has virtually no luck, Emira is chock full of it. Turns can drag in Emira, at least with five players. It's also designed to be a long game with early investments paying out over time. In the end, the luck factor combined with a game that seems overly long for what it is means Emira isn't a keeper for me, especially given that a player who falls out of contention has little chance of catching up and every probability of having to play out a very long string. Emira is interesting, and I'd probably play it again, but I'd put this firmly in the average game category, which just doesn't cut it these days.

It is good, just too long. Very nice art work. Has the flavor from those 40's or 50's adventure movies with Errol Flynn. One event-card (Sidi) looks very much like him. Basically it is an auction game somewhat close to the type of Ra, in that the auction dominates the game. Ok, you have some extra action through buying and playing event cards, but the auction takes about 80 % of a playrounds' time. In the auction players bid on the several trees they can level up, like status, camels, palace, charism, spice trade... Each round one or two ladies are revealed who each have different preferences about their sheiks. At the end of the round, the lady will join the harem, which serves her needs best.

The auction in this game is secondary to the choices you'll need to make if you win it.  This is a gamer's game with good strategic options and tough choices.  It's up to the usual Phalanx quality with gorgeous artwork on the cards and sturdy, thick bits.  You're building harems which is a theme that may put some players off.  However, it is done in good taste with no forced or arranged marriages to moralize over.

Apparently a game about choosing wives for a harem is bad, but a game about exploiting peasants in medieval Europe, piracy, or looting archaeological treasures, is fine. Seems like hypocrisy to me.

Anyway, if you get a chance to play this game go for it. So far nobody we've got to play it hasn't enjoyed it immensely.

Game is fun but the production is horrible. Not one of the boards will stay flat on the table.

Played twice. High expectations, but game did not deliver. Extremely long with 5 players, fiddly and formulaic. The auction for priority in choosing actions, the meat and potatoes of the game, just seemed like an empty shell. When you can win a game with basically a do nothing strategy, that just doesn't seem right.

Event cards are a crapshoot. Some are good, some useless, some neutral. Some of them have a negative effect on the game (killing camels, denying income) dragging out the game even longer. The whole event card mechanic seems tacked on, not well executed and is a big time sink.

After a few turns all players will have to invest in either appearance or status, the main preferences of most princesses, making the order in which the princesses come up at the end of the game seem very important, as switching strategies is not really an option, and there's no way to temporarily boost your rating in one or the other.

Although the gameplay is quicker with less players and therefore more bearable, the game still feels flawed at some fundamental level. I will never play this again with 5 players, but might be talked into a game with 3 players.

I think Emira has some good ideas, but also some serious issues.  There seems to be a runaway leader problem; left unchecked, a player can coast into victory without having to worry about such mundane things as winning the right to pick something next.  I suppose with skillful play all around, this wouldn't be as big of a problem (i.e., this seems to be an inherent feature of auction games, with people trying to figure out relative values of things).  I'd like to play this a couple more times to see if it gets better.  It certainly wasn't too long by any means (our first 4-player took under 2 hours) so I don't see what the complaints are about in that regard.

I really like it.  With five players, it's possible for one person to win with several people having attracted no emiras, but that is a consequence of reducing the requirements to keep the game a reasonable length with five.  This game has plenty of the delightful agony of wanting to do everything on your turn, but being quite limited.  The biggest problem I have with the game is that somehow, as interesting as it is, it doesn't flow smoothly:  At nearly any point in a turn, you might find yourself asking about the turn sequence, "Where are we?"  I think that if that rough edge could be sanded down, the game would go much faster.

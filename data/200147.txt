Originally rated 9, but dropping to 8. It's a beautiful game, it functions well, it's pleasant to create a 'print', and I enjoy playing it. This game is a very relaxing experience and the decisions are fairly simple. However, I was disappointed that despite how light this game seems, it's actually quite tricky for non-gamers to learn. The problem, I have figured out, is that this game has so many mechanisms that are easy for people who play lots of board games but can be overwhelming to people who are new to gaming (tableau building, set collection, worker placement, drafting, etc.). I recommend  playing this game with people who are transitioning from gateway games to midweight games or as filler for those who play medium-heavy games. With the former group, it will be difficult but teach them the basics for all those games, with the latter, it'll be a smooth & quick experience. My other complaint about this game is lack of variability. I can't see myself playing this game very often just because every playthrough feels exactly the same,  as nearly all cards in the deck come out during a game. I still enjoy it and I'll bring it out, but only once in a while and with the right group.

Kanagawa looks absolutely beautiful and manages to surprise the player with the core mechanics being actually built around the art. I have to say that I was slightly impressed about this since here we have a game in which the art is not just for eye candy. 

Mechanics are a mixture of engine building and set collection, so nothing special there except for how the art ties the pieces together. I think the greatest achievement of the game is that the art mimicking Japanese Ukiyo-e is pleasant and looks authentic enough to not turn into bad mockery. The game plays relatively fast and, while not being the most deep thought games, it still offers some trade-offs to ponder. We actually played a few games in succession which is a good sign. This game is a good example how much the visuals affect the whole experience (at least in my case) and my view could well be totally different if I found the looks repulsive.

Neat game, and interesting in that you need points from a lot of sources to win, rather than being able to focus on one or two aspects.

My favorite game of 2016! Easy to play and explain by mixing several mechanics that are presented each subtly, but in their combination allow to open many avenues for victory. Each decision is important because there is a lot to ponder on each card. Kind, season, resources, tools and points of prestige should be placed in the balance with an eye on my panorama as well as those of other players, trying to remember that characters, animals and buildings are no longer available and which are still in the deck to come The beginning is relaxed while over the end the tension grows when the options to score are narrowed. Great ludic proposal that also gives us a beautiful art, theme and components of great quality. A perfect 10!
Mi juego preferido del 2016! Facil de jugar y explicar mezclando varias mecanicas que se presentan cada una en forma sutil, pero en su combinación permiten abrir muchos caminos para la victoria. Cada desición es importante ya que hay mucho para ponderar en cada carta. Tipo, estación, recursos, herramientas y puntos de prestigio deben colocarse en la balanza con un ojo en mi panorama así como en los de los otros jugadores, tratando de recordar que personajes, animales y edificios ya no están disponibles y cuales todavia quedan en el mazo por venir. El comienzo es relajado mientras que sobre el final la tesión crece al acotarse las opciones para puntuar. Gran propuesta lúdica que ademas nos brinda un hermoso arte, tema y componentes de gran calidad. Un 10 perfecto!

I find Kanagawa a tough game to rate.  My head complains that this game doesn't give it a great deal to do.  There are a couple of push your luck elements (whether to take one or two ideal cards or hope to get them with a third, whether to take a  diploma now or press on for a higher value later), but the rest is largely a matter of doing the best you can with what you get.  My heart counters that this game is simply very pleasant to play.  Undeniably an element of that is delighting in the  artwork, the brushes in pots and the bamboo mat.  But this is also a game that plays quickly and smoothly with good fidelity to its theme of learning from Master Hokusai, while producing the most harmonious and appealing print.

Based on the artistry and setup of this game, we REALLY wanted and expected to like it.  But the instructions as written were wide open to many interpretations.  After quite a bit of study, discussion, and some arguing, we ended up not being able to do more than set up the game, admire it, and put it back away.  I hope to be able to play it correctly some day.

-The game looks nice, like looking at a painting.

Kanagawa is a game about art, looking gorgeous with its artsy components.
The theme is reflected in the artwork, in the playmat and in the gaming pieces.

Gameplay is quite simple, kinda derivative of Coloretto (though it misses the clever “add or take” and the possibility of taking negative points), but nevertheless compelling and singularly satisfying.

Master Cathala painted a true masterpiece?

RATING: 6.5
Light game that was intended to be highly accessible to both gamers and non-gamers. The diplomas and card-back information give the game a hint of deeper decision making, so the serious among the group aren't turned off. The push your luck of the card-drafting is an attempt to add a layer on top of the randomness of the cards. But, for better or worse (I say better since this is trying to be an accessible game), the randomness of the cards ends up being largely determinant. This is quite good for its price point.

The tableau is visually attractive and is set apart from a number of other games. The need to tuck every card can get a bit messy, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Teach time is probably around 10-15 minutes for new players. Play time is typically much less than 45 minutes, but we don't wait for the active player to complete their tile placement before moving forward. While this eliminates some of the strategic benefit from waiting until last, the game doesn't suffer for it and people typically finish their first game with "That was quick! Let's play again."

This game is wonderfully tranquil and fun. Allowing the cards to come out while waiting for the columns to maximize their usefulness is a fun exercise in patience and tension. Back to back games are fun and quick. First time we played no one in our group of four had played it before, but we enjoyed both games. So much fun. The only complaint is the stacking cards underneath each other in order to create your panorama. It can be difficult and you can mess up your whole row of cards too easily. But it's a minor gripe in a great game.

RATING: 8
This is a beautiful, japanese themed art game, where you draft cards which can either be used to build your studio to be able to paint more, or painted using whats already in your studio to add to your points. You end with a beautiful landscape of japanese artwork that will likely have you feeling fulfilled even if you aren't the victor.

Pretty simple on rules, but with enough strategy that I still don't think I have my strategy down yet. I like it a lot.

Note: probably best with 3,4 as opposed to 2.

A light, sweet and somewhat short game, Kanagawa combines cute components with a streamlined gameplay: I like how a bad hand might instead act as a springboard for improving one’s tools, thus making his comeback possible in just one turn.

Although it’s a typical multiplayer solitaire, its theme - as exciting as playing as a Japanese painter working on his masterpiece - feels like it’s been developed with the mechanisms and not just pasted on like eurogames usually do.

Not just a pretty game...

It sure seems like 2016 vomited a bunch of gorgeously peaceful card-laying pattern-building games. Kanagawa stands above the rest because of its incredible decision making. What cards to take? When to take them? Where to place those cards? Should you grab easy VPs or wait for bigger bonuses? Should you end the game early? Are you even winning? Overall, just a really cool game.

Yet another variation of the "drafting-only" style of game that seems to be all the rage these days. The paintbrush mechanic does add a degree of strategy that makes the game more interesting, and I like the Rise of Augustus-style goal scoring, where you decide to score a few points now or risk getting the higher-scoring goal later. The earlier scoring tiles give you long-term bonuses, though, so it can be tough to decide when to take one. 

My biggest problem with this one is that even though it's more strategic than, say, Sushi Go, the level of randomness is still so high that you have very little to shape your decisions: should I go for mountains? forests? Well, you really don't know what's coming out later, so often it feels pretty arbitrary. Still a decent little game.

A decent card game that feels a lot like Abyss to me in terms of pressing your luck to get cards to build out your tableau. However, the tableau in this one isn't very interesting: new paint colors, first player, and more brushes is about it.The lords in Abyss to me make the game by giving you special powers while the diplomas just give you points and in some cases are difficult to remember when you can take one. 

While Abyss is a much bigger box it's about the same weight, same playtime, has much better art, and it's less fiddly so I'd almost always rather reach for that instead.

This was fun, but I feel that it has some small flaws that come together to mar this otherwise very zen experience. I don't think that the wild tile can really be balanced with negative points, while the diplomas that give a rain are strictly inferior to the ones that just give points. I may be wrong, of course, and I would like to try it again, but for now it seems that some options are just better than the others.

Coloretto derivative. Significantly more involved than Coloretto, but lacking the key element that Coloretto has of some cards being bad for you.

This is a lovely and serene game that gives players a surprising amount to think about each turn. The timing of when cards are dealt will make it a bit different every time, so it's all about how you make the most of what's offered on the mat.

Easy to teach, fast to play, and with beautifully done components. This is a good Goldilocks game for our group - just right. If I had any beef with the game, it's that sometimes it's hard to slip cards underneath your existing painting/studio.

This game charms you with its components, particularly the brushes and the play mat. A significant percentage of the scoring is reminiscent of Augustus. You may take a tile when you meet its requirements, foregoing a chance for a better tile of the same type, or you can wait and hope that a better tile is still available when you meet those requirements. It's a neat scoring mechanism that I wish were used more often.

This one is all about the components. Lots of luck of the draw, little real tension, this would be a nice enough alternative, probably rated a 6 for me, if it weren't for the art.

It may fall into rotation as an occasional option for nights when we aren't feeling particularly sharp, but it truly does little to distinguish itself. Unless you have a small collection and a taste for lighter fare, I can't recommend it.

A simple little engine building game, where players gain cards from a 19th century Japanese art school.  Cards gained can be added to their print they are painting, or flipped around and added to their knowledge base, increasing their skill in what they can paint.  Slightly clunky game, but once you understand the counterintuitive mechanics, it flows along nicely.

A beautiful and engaging set-collecting game - Coloretto with added complexity

In [thing=200147][/thing] you are painting a piece of beautiful art.  It takes the mechanic from [thing=5782][/thing] whereby your decision is to take a row of cards now, or wait for it to get better but possibly lose it to someone else.  Then it adds in a double-use for the cards: they either increase your ability to be an effective painter, or they can be reversed to be part of the painting.  This works very well and adds interesting decisions beyond simply what column of cards to take and when, as now you have to decide which side of each card to use in your tableau.

Sadly the rule book is appalling.  Quite how such a simple game can be made so complicated in a few short pages I have no idea.  I would recommend watching a video of the game as then you will get the game is 5 minutes.

It plays in 45 minutes and is a delight to look at as you build a delightful painting in front of your eyes.  Excellent.

At about the halfway point (in both 3 ans 2 player games) managing your studio too simple to be an effective mechanism. 

Otherwise, this game is superior to one of my favorite games; Augustus in many ways besides player count. Really a missed opportunity so far, but would like to try it as a 4 player game before giving up on it completely. 

--Update-- After looking through the rules multiple times, I discovered that we were using brushes wrong. We were only using colors once, but were using the move action to allow a brush to be used multiple times, which is wrong. We will have to play again to fully assess this game.

I really want to love this game! The art is so beautiful and the components are the cutest, but it didn't feel deep enough in a two-player game. I fell behind in the beginning and it was impossible to catch up. I think (and hope) that it's better with more players, though. As of now, when in the mood for a game in this style, I would rather play Tokaido.

This is a light game, but it is elegant, pretty, and quite a bit of fun. I love the art, but I also like the interesting decisions it gives you, especially with the small couple of cards you cannot see. A little risk-taking. A little push-your-luck. But mostly just a thoughtful puzzle.

An ok game. A little disappointed about this Cathala game, since I tend to like his recent games quite a bit. It's hard to pinpoint what I didn't like too much about it. Maybe it's a little hard to understand to what grade the different powers in the studio can benefit you. Maybe it's because it is a little fiddly. Anyway, I will play it again, but not too eager.

Simple light and very pretty set collection game whereby the decision when to take cards is made more interesting by adding certain cards face down so you are never sure exactly what you are getting, and the limitation on not being allowed to go back and claim a 'diploma' if you have already passed on it adds a little bit of a push your luck feel to the mechanics

Rulebook is fairly wordy for such simple concepts and there possibly should have been a better symbol or marking to indicate  X many of the same or X many different as this tripped up some players on more than on occasion. Otherwise, really quite impressed with this :)

Out of the three players sitting at the table one had a very hard time understanding the rules and played as it came, without trying to achieve any given objective. He steamrolled the two others. I was left wondering where the game was here. I *might* try it again just to double check. But only if I do not have any better thing to do ...

Love the artwork.  There is a lot of game here for such a tiny box size.  

It's actually a lot deeper than maybe is first apparent.  The initial choice regarding the point to take the cards is taken straight from Zooloretto - do I stay in for the extra cards, and maybe i'll get the one I want or do I take the card I really want now before someone else does.

The second level of choices come down to how to place the cards.  Do I upgrade the studio or paint? If I paint then I break my season run.  If I add it to my studio it might do nothing at all, it could also cost -2 points at the end for the wildcard brush.

So many choices for such a quick playing game.  Well recommended.

Deeper than it looks and drafting with two I thought it would always be a no brainer to wait for the third card but that is not the most optimal play so it really does scale well!

Choosing the diplomas brings some interesting tension.  Impressed by this design as it had better quality decisions than I was expecting.

Quality production all the way around.

Once I saw that Bruno Cathala was one of the designers, I had to try it.  So glad I did!  The take-it-now or wait is similar to Coloretto, but there is a great deal more variety in the types of sets and features you can build and score.  The whole presentation is simply gorgeous.  The decision to take a reward or abandon it for the chance at a better one is brilliant design.  There are some rather tough tactical choices to be made, the pride of building up both your studio (abilities) and painting (scoring), and beautiful aesthetics that simply make it a delight to play.

It's a beautiful game with simple rules. There is theoretically a lot of tension when choosing when to pick a column or when to get a diploma, but for 2 players there wasn't enough tension for me. It does seem to play better with more players so I will revisit my rating after I've tried that.

RATING: 5.5
Art is one of my interests and thus the theme attracted me, but the gameplay is just average. The core mechanic is similar to that of the "Coloretto" family: either take all cards from a column or wait for another card to be added, up to a maximum of three. But as you can always use every card you get (pictures you can't paint add skills or other bonuses), there is little incentive to withdraw early. There are also objective tiles that use a gambling mechanic that I don't like, consisting in taking something now or leaving it in hopes of getting something better later.

The decisions are too simple and lack tension. In my first game, I simply always took three cards (often what was left) and painted everything I could. I won tied with a player who painted almost all cards with the same season, with the third player one point behind with a mixed strategy. It gave me the impression that, no matter what you do, scores will be close and/or the game will be won by whoever is luckiest to get this or that objective tile.

On the production, the wooden pieces and board are nice, but I found the in-game artwork much less appealing than the cover.

Good drafting(ish), set collection and light tableau-building game. Interesting variant on a draft. The decision of getting few cards that you need or many that you are less interested in (or possibly getting both) makes a good mechanism.
Having scoring opportunities both for how you build your tableau and the sets you collect is a nice touch.

Beautiful looking game, stunning. Traditional Japanese art-style, it really works well for the game that is thematically tied strongly to Japan and its art culture and traditions. This game is like Antoine Bauza's Tokaido: a game that induces good feelings, journey to your inner self, to find the peace of mind. I realize that this is type of game that is almost impossible to bring up to the table with certain kind of gamers, but there's a place and a time for a game, no, for the piece of art, that this game represents.

A mostly relaxing tableau building game. Each round, you will pick up new card(s) and place them in your tableau. There is a bit of a push-your-luck as if you pass, more cards will be added to the display of cards available. When you pick cards, you take all of the cards in one column. So if you wait, you will get more cards (generally a good thing), but if you really want something, you might want to go ahead and take it even though you will be missing out on being able to pick up the maximum (3) cards.

You're trying to create a painting with ideally a string of the same "season" icon and variety in subject matter (ie: many different people or buildings, etc). However you have to have the required paint colors available in your studio to paint each card.

So part push your luck, some tableau building, and very pretty game. Wouldn't call it worker placement.

I just didn't feel like there were a lot of decisions to be made. I only played it at two, so it's possible that at higher player counts it gets more interesting, but the vast majority of the rounds we both just waited for all three cards to come out as it seemed like unless there was a particularly important symbol in one column, either set would be worth pretty much the same few points. If there are more sets of cards there's probably a better chance that some seem much better than others. But I played it at two so I'm rating it for two. And at two it was very decision light.

Kanagawa is a head-turning game. With the bamboo card-drafting mat, the elegantly sculpted paintbrushes and the simple, stylized card art - it is without a doubt a beautiful production. Cards are drafted each turn and added to your tableau in order to improve your abilities or meet publicly displayed goals. The drafting mechanism is like Coloretto on autopilot. Card piles are laid out one card at a time with each player being given an opportunity to take a pile after 1, 2, or 3 cards - but players have no control over the piles and one card in each pile is even face-down. Cards have two parts - a painting part and a studio part. You need to meet the requirements in your studio in order to add to your painting so where a card ends up is a pretty easy decision.

The goal tiles can be claimed when the requirements are met and goals range from having sets of objects in your paintings to having certain features in your studio. When 11 cards are added to a player's painting the game ends. Frankly, Coloretto is a simpler and quicker game with a more compelling decision point in its "draw or draft" structure and I'd just rather play that. If you really appreciate beautiful, light games with high production, then I'm sure you'd appreciate this!

Relatively light card drafting. The artwork and production elements are top tier. Ideally, the manual would be less cryptic. The attempt to present the instructions in terms that are consistent with the theme was a neat idea that ended up clouding rather than clarifying the rules. Aside from that bump in its learning curve, Kanagawa provides some engaging decisions and is both fun and pretty. Recommended.

This game is beautifully produced. The board was brilliantly chosen to be a bamboo mat, like the ones you use to roll sushi. The paint pots are unique and thematic wooden pieces. The art is thematic and draws you into the game.

Unfortunately the gameplay did not live up to the presentation. The decision to pass was not nearly as interesting as I was expecting it to be. At the beginning of the game passing early is understandably unusual, but even in the mid to late game everyone was finding it nearly impossible to justify leaving with only one card.

To its credit it was mercifully short. I could see younger players or very casual gamers enjoying this. It has some elements of engine building in an attractive package and short playtime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Kanagawa  thrives on its artwork and production values, especially the tatami board and the modeled paintbrushs. The gameplay takes a moment to get used to but is simple once understood. Is there a card you need? Is it so valuable to take now or do you risk to wait one round to get one more card and hope that nobody else takes it? Each card has two potential uses: either it’s added to the atelier to improve painting skills or it is becoming a part of the painting. Various awards can be claimed by the player who first fulfills the respective preconditions. If the player decides not to claim an award because he hopes for a better award later, the rejected award cannot be taken retroactively.

A nice enough game but gameplay won’t differ much from game to game. Too long for a filler, not enough on offer behind the fancy exterior to be a full-blown game.

I ended up buying this at Spiel 2016 and have played a couple times in the last few days (all 2p). The game itself it very clean and straight-forward, which I think fits wonderfully with the Japanese/minimal theming. The instructions are also easy to digest, with only one or two ambiguities (do wilds count for a set diploma?), and after playing one game, the flow really becomes second nature. There's definitely a mix of randomness (card draws) and strategy (which cards to take, where to place them, which diplomas to take), which seems to be in a pretty good balance. I only had one game where I felt I just could not come back from behind and was getting screwed by the deck. But being more in the Euro-style, there are several ways to gain points, and even when you think you've been destroyed, the final scores end up being relatively close.

All in all, I think it's definitely worth the price (~23€) and is a solid medium-weight game. I'm looking forward to trying it with 3 and 4 players.

For a game that comes in such a small box, it delivers a masterclass in production and efficiently tight gameplay.  With elements of drafting, set collection, and a generous helping of puzzliness (copyrighting that word), this is a real gem.  That wooden mat and the cute little wooden components are just an extra bonus that takes the experience up a notch.  And it should go without saying that the art is stunning, transporting you to some ancient place as the picture reveals itself before you.

RATING: 6
This is an insanely beautiful game, and I love the multi-use cards. That being said, I'm not too fond of the push-your-luck scoring of the diplomas, nor of the way the cards are acquired. In the end, it's so rarely worth getting cards quickly compared to getting 3. One of the worst things about this game, I feel, is how turn order works: if you're last, to become first, others have to let you do so, or you have to take a chance and for it to pay off. Given how incredibly important turn order is, if you're stuck in last place, it's going to be a loooooong game.

This is a nice little filler+ (a little bit longer than a filler) that plays best at 3 or 4 players. The core gameplay of card drafting and set collection is really well executed, the artwork and theme make this this easy to ge to table. I've tried this with a couple groups and everyone has been really positive about it, it's very pleasant to play and yet has some interesting decisions to it.

Még kettesben is van benne annyi döntési lehetőség, amitől izgalmasnak mondható, de amúgy is inkább meditatív tevékenység. :)

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is a beautiful game where one is painting Japanese scenes and is seeking to complete sets, etc to score points. It does have the push your luck to score more points element where people are competing to claim tiles for certain objectives and you can choose not to claim something you could in order to push for something better - but someone could steal that better one away if they beat you there.

Ein Genmälde malen.
Es werden 4 Karten aufgedeckt. Dann wird Reihum gefragt ob jemand eine Spalte nehmen möchte. Wer eine nimmt, ist raus aus der Runde. Alle weiteren bekommen pro Reihe eine weitere Karte angeboten. Spätestens bei der dritten Karte muss eine Reihe genommen werden.
Die Karten werden nun in die eigene Auslage gelegt. Man erhält neue Optionen, oder kann mit seinen vorhandenen Optionen sein Bild weitermalen, was schliesslich die Siegpunkte bringt.
Das Wichtigste ist wohl, sein Bild immer in der gleichen Jahreszeit zu malen, das macht eine menge Punkte aus.
Mir gefällt das Spiel nach dem zweiten Mal spielen immernoch nicht so toll. Es ist irgendwie nicht mein Thema, nicht mein Spiel.

First impression after one 4p game.  Bruno Cathala has mastered the art of the set collection games over time.  Kanagawa is a simple set collection game with pleasant graphics a little push your luck element.  It is easy to explain and plays quickly.  A fine filler and a game I enjoyed picking up and playing though I would not buy it for my collection.  I prefer it to fancier games like Abyss (also from Cathala).  The main criticism about the components is that the cards are thin and since they have to be slid one after the other over and over again during a match the action is unpleasant and the cards will likely wear out quickly and make the game look old and used fast.

About the weight one would expect from an Iello release. Coloretto-like selection mechanic with dual-use cards (each can be used as a color in your palette or to create a painting). Press your luck and set collection elements are present as you can either claim goal cards as you achieve them (e.g. - 3 trees on your paintings) or pass and go for the next higher goal of the same type for more VP (e.g. - 4 trees on your paintings). Light point salad feel as you can score points via goal cards, chains of paintings with matching seasons, and palette/painting cards with printed VP symbols. All in all a good way to introduce unseasoned gamers to many of the mechanics of the world of euros.

After a play with both two and three players I find it slightly better with three. Turn order matters more for the purpose of achieving goals before other players.

Turn cards, take card, build them onto your painting. You turn the cards into paint on the bottom row and you turn the card into a piece of the painting on the top row. Also try to score many cards in a row of the same season, that's basically it. smooth playing card game, not so bad for once in while.

Kanagawa war auf der diesjährigen Spiel ein richtiger Eyecatcher. Das Cover ist sehr stimmig und das Spielmaterial sehr hübsch. Hinzu kommt ein sehr individuelles und fast schon romantisches Thema. Die Spieler sind japanische Maler und befinden sich in der Ausbildung. Nun gilt es, ein besonders beeindruckendes Bild als Abschlussarbeit zu zeichnen. Dafür wählen die Spieler Karten aus einer Auslage, ähnlich wie bei Coloretto. Die Karten legt man dann an sein Startplättchen an, so ensteht tatsächlich ein Bild, dass sich immer weiter ausdehnt. Auf den einzelnen Karten können Bäume, Tiere, Menschen oder Gebädue sein. Je nach Art und Anzahl, kann man dafür Diplome mit zusätzlichen Eigenschaften oder Siegpunkte bekommen. Auch die Jahreszeit auf den einzelnen Karten spielt eine Rolle. Kanagawa ist ein eher ruhiges Spiel, mit wunderhübscher Optik und einem schönen, flüssigen Spielablauf.

RATING: 8
Kanagawa is a beautiful game from the artistic styling and component quality through to the mechanisms and game play. 

The theme is very Japanese and Zen. As students of your master you are seeeking to improve your studio (which represents your skills) in order to paint a panorame that takes into account the seasons, terrain and various images. 

Each turn the players are looking to take cards in a given column some of which are face up and others face down. By passing a player can seek to gain further knowledge in the form of having more cards added to the columns. However if the rest of the players take offers consecutively, you can be left with a card set you didn't want. This felt quite similar to the mechanism that drives Coloretto/Zooloretto. 

When cards are taken the player must decide if they will paint the scene on a card or add it to their studio, thus granting them more skill to paint. I always like games where cards have more than one purpose and Kanagawa does this beautifully. 

Throw in a range of other mechanisms such as the number of paint pots a player has, the ability to move them to make use of their various skills and the bonus point tiles that the players are raceing one another to accomplish and Kanagawa has more meat than many a game of this box size. 

Our friends have this one and usually that will see me not look to acquire a game. But this is too beautiful a production (and a good game to boot) not to acquire. 

A must have for my collection. I rate this a solid 8 and it could go to 9 if the game play is compelling with 2-players.

Nice / pleasant card drafting / set collection game.

Bumped rating up 0.5 after playing another game, 4 player this time.  I don't know if it was that we had 4 players, or that something just clicked with me, or both, but this time around, I found the game more engaging and fun.  Tense push your luck feeling with going after the many different objectives.  Just another great little title from Mr. Cathala, that plays in an hour or less, that can be enjoyed by both veterans and newbie gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Kanagawa is a light push-your-luck filler with three major decisions: 1) Do you take a column of cards or do you let it grow (and risk that someone else takes it first)? 2) Do you use a card for your studio (improve your engine) or do you use it for a painting (increase your victory points)? 3) Do you take a cheap victory point tile or skip it and wait until you can take a more expensive victory point tile (and risk getting none at all)? A bit luck-driven but overall a pleasant game with many "No, I wanted that!" moments.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]I finally got to play this with my family and it was a hit. First I'll mention that the art and production are top notch, this is a beautiful game. Kanagawa is another perfect 30 - 45 minute family weight game and there is just enough going on in the game that it will appeal to folks in most game groups. The combination of drafting, set collection and duel use cards (they are either paintings or paints/special powers) make this a very engaging game to play considering how light it is. 

I'm always impressed by games that fall into this weight class and time frame yet manage to create play experiences that you want to keep revisiting similar to heavier games I enjoy. Kanagawa falls into the same category as Takenoko, Finca and Habitats.[/i]

First, this game is GORGEOUS.  Second, the gameplay is really excellent.
Mechanisms I love: multi-use cards, lot drafting, tableau-building, set collection, press your luck,  and LOTS of ways to score points.  The game is really engaging and has you paying attention to what everyone else is doing all the time.  The only downside is that rounds have a sort of long break when someone decides to take cards.  You have to sit and watch them make a bunch of decisions in a row.  Doesn't matter a whole lot, I'll still play it every time.

Spent the whole game struggling to slide the cards underneath each other (clearly a game designed for people with fingernails) which caused the top-heavy paintbrush tokens to topple over and roll around, making me lose track of where they should be. Can't believe that somewhere during testing a player didn't point out that discs would have been better. In the end used coins but gave up because the whole thing was just too tedious.

A clever and fun combination of tableau building and card drafting.  The artwork and components are top notch.  The rule book, which tries to immerse itself in the theme, is a bit confusing.  The rules editor should have adhered more to clarity than theme and just left the thematic elements to the intro.  I have heard some complain about the fiddliness of sliding relatively small cards halfway under other cards and maintaining a neat chain of cards.  Yes, it can be a little tricky, but I think the complaints are a little overdone and they do not get in the way of the enjoyment of the game.  I would also add this is a perfect game for couples who prefer games not to be overly mean.  The game maintains a decent degree of competitiveness but is certainly not cut-throat.  Sometimes you will need to draft a card to keep it away from an opponent and  that is the extent of the meanness.  (I realize the correct term here is "hate drafting", but it just doesn't feel hateful here).  All in all, a very enjoyable game that will see a ton of plays.

Kanagawa is a card-drafting game about creating Japanese paintings. Cards to be drafted are arranged in lots on a mat; players can jump the turn order by picking early to get only one or two cards, or they can wait to get the full complement of three cards. Cards can be played either on the studio side, which gives the player a better ability to create art by giving them paint colors or other bonuses, or on the painting side, but only if the player has the matching paints with ink pots. There are a variety of bonus tiles that can be claimed by the first player to have certain types of paintings which provide the main points in the game. This game isn't the most intuitive to learn and play, but I think it works well as a simple drafting game. Also, the art is fantastic.

Interesting decisions which are always a sign of a good game. Only real complaint is it was a little unclear initially in understanding how all the rules work. The rule book is thorough and seems clear but I still had some trouble initially figuring out everything. That said, once you're past that bump the game plays extremely well.
Theme works for the game and it's definitely a peaceful, zen-like atmosphere.

One of my favorites for this month. Drafting with some push your luck. The game is just gorgeous and the game play is smooth and a delight. Bruno Catahala is on a role this year and I have been enjoying his titles more and more. This is definitely one for the shelves, I very much enjoyed it after the first play.

RATING: 5
A beautiful production from iello, which is not surprising. Love the mat and the artwork, although the card art is less impressive than the box's. Overall, the game is a little too random and the choices more or less seem arbitrary. There's almost no reason not to pass to get more cards, especially early in the game where you don't really have anything to go off of. I'd play it again now that I know how the game plays (rules explanation wasn't great), but I suspect it'll pretty much be the same ho-hum experience.

RATING: 6.6
Awkward card shifting, mechanical gameplay, random card draw, no theme connection, just some small pictures. Plays on autopilot with constant feeling of "uh, I can't do this and there was nothing I could do to change it". Squeeze what you can from what you were given. Plays fast. Typical Cathala's "well, I have this design in my desk, might as well release it to random publisher, until I finish my other, proper good game" kind of game.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this game.  I had the pleasure of playing this game with Mike Fitzgerald at a con, and boy was it a fun experience.  This game held up great in it's own right (despite playing with Mike), however.

I enjoyed the decisions revolving around the multi-use cards.  Depending on what is available to you, how you have adjusted your paint and what you're trying to collect...well, there are a lot of neat decisions to make here.

Nothing overall particularly new in this game, although it does take a bunch of things I've seen and package them pretty well. If I were a less-experienced gamer, I'd be more wowed by it, and it may still move up a little bit with future plays. At its heart, it's a set collection game with a press-your-luck Coloretto style mechanism to obtain cards. I do like that the cards can be used in multiple ways, and that increasing the quality of your studio allows you to make more interesting paintings. Certainly there is a nice challenge to balance getting a bunch of a similar season in a row with making the combinations to get the diplomas (bonuses) that also adds to the decision set here. I guess that I just found that I've played other similar games in the past, and this one is not quite unique enough to set itself apart. However, I'll close by saying that the art is really beautiful, and after playing it, you feel like you're in harmonious balance inside a Japanese temple.

Great little set collecting game (filler plus?) with a push your luck element. I like how the cards can be used as part of your painting or as part of your tools (additional paint colors, brushes, and other bonus). The artwork is beautiful. The game also had great components including a bamboo mat board.

I found it didn't play well with 2, as the options for cards to pick from aren't as many and there isn't as much tension of whether the other players will choose the card(s) you want.

This is currently my girlfriend's favorite game, and she places it at a 9, while I'm at a 7.5. The game can be fiddly, especially with the fragile brush pot minis, and it requires a pretty decent sized footprint. That said, I can't think of another recent game where the theme and game play are so solidly intertwined, and the art is gorgeous. I also appreciate that there are many paths to victory, and there often is no clear winner until the final score is tallied.

RATING: 7
I really enjoy playing this game as opposed to Coloretto, as there's more strategy to what you can do when you take a pile. What is missing, though, is the opportunity to screw others by keeping track of their cards and messing up their plans. What that results in is less urgency to keep track of your opponents. Of course keen players will do this to ensure their dominance for certain diplomas, but it's not required.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An uninteresting drafting and push your luck game. Often choices are obvious or you get what you get. When you get the cards they basically play themselves.

Decision on whether to take the bonus or push your luck and hope for additional symbols is not engaging and pretty luck based.

tl;dr: light but enjoyable

This game is a bit lighter than what I usually prefer, but I found this game surprisingly enjoyable. It's all about doing the most with the fewest resources. If you're constantly investing in more paint and colors and what not, it will make your next turns easier, but you're not really adding to your score.
I'm not sure why I prefer this game over other, similar games. I guess it just works well and gives choices that are just hard enough.

Very likeable filler whose stated playtime for one time actually reflects real playtime. I admit that continous artwork in games is a pet peeve of mine. Apart from scoring victory points it is really pleasant to add lessons to your print. Surely, more experience would lead to a state less solitairesque.I hardly ever had an eye for what my opponents were doing. Sometimes, yeah, but mostly I was caught in the serene attraction of my own studio/prints. Also, I would've thought there was more tension in the decision wether to broaden your knowledge versus putting your knowledge to practice. Most of the rounds each of us decided to broaden their knowledge until each coloumn had three cards. It wasn't profitable to prematurely put the knowledge to practice or at least it didn't seem like there was the urge to do so. But overall, I really enjoyed this not only graphically beautiful game.

Gorgeous artwork abounds in this simple card drafting game which uses a mechanism much like Coloretto. The choices go beyond just which cards to draft, as all of the cards may be played as part of your painting or to improve your art studio, both of which have different methods for gaining victory points. Very nice 45 minutes experience. Downrated after a few plays as the card tucking is fiddly and the game should be easier to teach. Awkward rules maybe?

I have to say that the gorgeous artwork in Kanagawa is very important to the enjoyment I get out of it. It is just so satisfying to see your beautiful painting expand during the course of the game, even though I would have preferred it if the cards were bigger and thicker. Love the little bamboo mat. By itself, the game is interesting enough due to its Coloretto-like mechanism for obtaining the cards and the decision to either add the cards to your painting or to your workshop to increase your options. All in all a good family game that is easy to get to the table due to its ease of play and great artwork.

There is absolutely nothing here that hasn't been seen before. Kanagawa is a set collecting game with a sort of push-your-luck via a pie rule-ish drafting mechanic. That's not to say there is anything wrong with it, as I enjoyed my play very much. It's partially because such tried and true mechanics already work and partially because it's flat out beautiful to look at. I would highly recommend this to the Tokaido "I play for zen" crowd, but otherwise I think it is redundant if you have any other games that feature these tried-and-true mechanics.

This game is pretty fun.  The rulebook I found to be TERRIBLE, but for the most part once you start playing it seems like a straight forward game.  I really like how the cards can be used differently and you can either add them to your print or to your studio and you have to decided right then.  I think it is a fantastic game and it would be interesting to play with 4 players.  I feel it is a game that scales pretty well I think they just all play different depending on the players.

Mechanically, the game has some light drafting, light set collection, a little push-your-luck, and cards that have two different usages. I found the decisions on whether to use your cards in your studio or print to be interesting. Also intriguing was the decision of when to grab a diploma tile since you can only grab one of each type per game and once you pass on one, you pass on it forever. This provides a push-your-luck game ("am I satisfied with this diploma I can fulfill NOW, or do I push forward and try to get the next one?") Though there is definitely interaction between the players, both in the drafting stage and in the diploma-collection phase, I found Kanagawa to be quite a zen-like experience. The artwork is so soothing to me and the game provides a very dreamy tone. There’s still some interesting decisions to make, though. All the games  we've played so far have had a wide variety of prints and diplomas claimed.

Jaj, ez nagyon szép és kellemes volt, szívesen játszom majd még vele. A set collection jól kitalált, a képek gyönyörűek, de az egész játék megjelenése egyfajta nyugodtságot áraszt. Előbb-utóbb felrakom a polcra, az ára sem vészes, ráadásul gateway v családi játéknak is elmegy.

What a fun little game. Better than expected. Nice decision making that can be played quickly. Should also be a great travel game. This needs an APP!

[I]tl;dr - Kingdomino has some fun, interesting decisions in a fifteen-minute playtime, but it lacks the extra snap that makes a good filler endure.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Kingdomino is a pretty fun tile-layer that plays in about ten or fifteen minutes. This is a good filler because it's low strategy, but has interesting decisions. And of course, if you get knocked out or totally flub, we can play another game right after, and it's only another fifteen minutes. 

Players are working on their own individual puzzle -- a 5x5 kingdom of interlocking pieces. They will compete to claim different tiles of different landscape types. Some landscape tiles have crowns on them, which will help you score more points at the end of the game. 

Kingdomino is short and sweet, and super easy to teach. It's missing that extra bite that make [thing=142239]Vye[/thing] and [thing=192291][/thing] so special, but you may find that it works for your group. I happily traded mine away, though.

Tile laying is a satisfying genre of games to play. You can see the effect of your doings instantly and most of the time it is also easy to play without analysing the situation too much. Just play and fill the patterns. 

Kingdomino can be a bit repetitive though. This is because there are not that many ways to score points and competition over the best tiles is not as fierce as I would like. Sure you can take a bad tile this turn to be better positioned in the player order for the next round but there is no guarantee that the type of tile you want will be revealed. So in the end it really does not matter, which position you play because the game tends to balance itself.

Scoring can be quite tricky with lot of sums to do but it is not the worst I have seen. However, building is fun to an extent regardless how competitively you play.

6.5 --> 7.8. Review my judgement after my second play. This works well, easy to teach, relatively fun, has the right balance of interaction. There is still a bit too much the "obvious choice" in the tile selection. However the way we place the tile is quite important and this is quite fun

Started 9, going to 10.   Really simple concept but the picking of tiles is really a great mechanic (pick a good tile means next round you get less of a choice).  Very addicting light filler game.  Not light on strategy, but a solid filler game for lighter gamers that more hardcore gamers can handle as well.  I like heavier 3-4+ out of 5 level games, but still really enjoyed this.

Cathala is one of my favorite designers, he makes a lot of good games, but a lot of bad games, too (something expected for someone that launches more than 4 games a year).

This game is very good, you have to fit things together and can't forget about the crowns because it doesn't matter if you have a great lake in your kingdom if you are not enable to make points out of it.

The gameplay is very smooth and fast, a game with 4 players may last at most 20, 25 minutes long.

Production quality is very high, there is a great insert and the tiles are thick.

Elegantly simple. Absurdly fun for reasons I don't fully understand. Quick.

Two complaints...

1. The rulebook is terrible which I don't know how they managed to pull off since it is so short. (typos and just hard to understand imo). 

2. The back of the rulebook has pictures of how many of each type of tiles there are in the dominos. Knowing these ratios are critical to good play. I think they should have included cards for each player with the same information, otherwise one has to prop the flimsy rulebook up.

Nonetheless fantastic game.

RATING: 7
I'm not entirely sure that I need a 15-minute filler, but as these things go Kingdomino is pretty acceptable.  The tile drafting system is the game, requiring decisions about taking a decent tile now, setting yourself up to take something better next round or grabbing the tile that's really good for an opponent.  Aside from that, the game sets familiar problems of optimising the placement of tiles in a grid.  Kingdomino is by no means a brain burner, but nor is it utterly trivial.  I agree with those who say it should be played either four- or two-player advanced so that all the tiles are in play, significantly reducing the luck of the draw.

Production quality is very good.  The chunky tiles are a joy to play with.  The artwork is bright and functional.  The rules are a very easy read.

RATING: 5
A simple, perhaps even elegant design, wherein turn order determination, tile choosing and tile laying are combined (conflated/compressed?) into very nearly a single action.  The net result is a very fast game wherein players choose tiles (which determine the turn order for choosing tiles the next turn) and add the chosen tile to their mini 5 x 5 kingdoms, which score at the end of the game based upon contiguous terrains and crowns within each terrain.  Felt perhaps a bit too simple for my tastes.

Simple (on the surface), quick and easy to learn. Works well with children + adults. Excellent tile quality and very funny/detailed artwork. Some interaction by denying your opponents tiles.

We play with 10 points for symmetry around your castle, and 5 points for using all tiles ... and you may discard tiles instead of using them.

We use all tiles for 2,3 and 4 players:
2 player - 7*7
3 player - you use 4 extra tiles to create 'beams' on the center of each side.
4 player -  regular

Very quick 15 minute filler but very engaging.  Fit the landscape domino pieces you bid for into a 5x5 (or 7x7 grid for - recommended - two player  expanded game), bidding for the tiles.  It is the play area restriction that makes the game interesting and challenging.  You have to match at least one terrain to an adjacent tile or home tile.  So best leave a side of the home tile empty for our final tile to obtain optional all tile and centre bonuses.  Update Nov-11:  wonderful game.  Will become life long favourite.  Up rating to 10.

An interesting approach to drafting tiles combined with a very simple scoring system that allows you to judge well what you and your opponents want makes for a fun game.

It is still a light game but a fun one that can get played easily.

A fantastic tile laying "super filler" that plays in 10-15 minutes and gives you plenty of decisions the whole time. The tiles are super thick so will last a while and the art is excellent. While the tile-laying puzzle part is completely multiplayer solitaire, the simple bidding mechanism gives you opportunities to block (or be blocked by) other players adding in some nice player interaction. The game scales well from 2-4. The 2p variant where you play with a 7x7 grid and use all the tiles is probably the best form of the game once you've been introduced to the base game. This game scales well, is easy to teach, and both non-gamers and gamers will find something to like here. I can see why this won the SdJ.

This was fun. Flo and I played twice over the weekend. We played the "advanced" game (7X7 grid, place 2 kings out per turn). I enjoy these light kind of diversions every once in a while. I think Flo enjoyed it quite a bit as well. There are some tough decisions each game such as when to give up on a territory and start a new one, but it mostly plays easy breezy. This would be my pick for the SDJ this year. Keeper, at least for a while.

Edit 7/21/2017: Nailed the SDJ pick!

Almost too light and too quick with 4 players, but still a lot of fun. Where this game really shines however is in the 7x7 two player variant. Having two selections per turn combined with the much larger kingdom to organise really takes it to the next level.

This is such a simple but fun game.  There is enough to it to keep a gamer interested & so simple that the young can play & the non gamers.  I love that it can work with all kinds of ages.  Queendomino is very good yet it does not replace Kingdomino because it is so fast & easy to teach & very fun...What a great Idea this game is:)

A fun, fast and easy to teach game about tile laying, tile drafting, with a sprinkle of some spatial elements. There is nothing innovative or exciting about the game, but for the length of play-time and for introducing gaming to non-gamers it's a keeper.

You draft tiles with an eye towards turn order in the next round, and then place tiles to score points galore!

The artworks charming and full of Easter eggs. Best with four players or a variant on two, so you can play with all the tiles.

A Spiel des Jahres winner that seems to scale pretty well between gamers and newbies and everyone. I found it better than anticipated. I'd heard a lot of positives from gamers who recognize the simplicity of the game. Once I heard all the rules and played it, I realized there was still more to it than I thought. It may be best with 2 players where you get 2 meeples each? It seems like the right game of game to win the SdJ... I think it's worthy of that title and a nice, little game.

A neat little game with some opportunities for thought. It is possible that, through luck of the draw, one player could see most of their game dictated by the actions of others though. Luckily the game is short enough that any imbalance is more or less capable of being shrugged off.

RATING: 9
This is a simple city-building, tile-laying game. There are only two things that set it aside from other tile laying games. First, the tiles have two sides and when placing, one side must match an existing tile (hence domino in the name). Second, players use their king to select which tile they want, and the position of the tile they take determines their turn for drafting in the next round. 

This may not seem like much, but its enough to give this quick game some interesting decisions and tough choices. Easy to learn but tough to win consistently, this game is one of my favorite fillers of 2016. My only complaint is that there could have been a little more to the scoring of the cities, as the scoring is very simple. However, with each round taking 10 to 15 minutes, it might be better that it doesn't over-complicate anything.

OK, very light but very short. Nice mechanism where you can choose a good tile but choose late next time or a not so good but choose early. Played with 3p and some tiles out, not sure if I would like it 2p or 4p with all tiles in, becomes a much simpler game then.

This is one of those games that the rules don't really give you a feel for if the game will be good or not.  Ended up liking it.... from the gameplay to the art / graphic design of the game.  It surprisingly plays really well 2 players, and can be a bit cutthroat as you really need to block other people.  Planning to keep, and do see why it was nominated for the 2017 SDJ

Provisional rating of 6--we played 2 games 5x5 and one 7x7.  I much prefer the 2player 7x7 game.  Husband said "I do not dislike this game" so I imagine it will become part of my rotation with him.  I think there are some interesting things going on with blocking, turn order and spacial reasoning so this could climb a bit ranking-wise.

I'm a sucker for tile laying games and this one is no exception. As the name suggests, it's a clever tweak of Dominoes with a drafting mechanic. The rules are wicked simple, but the decisions however provide an unexpected depth. Only played it 2-player, which works great and I can imagine it's equally as good with more.

Update: Played with 4. It was awesome. Love this game.

This is the best game I've ever played with kids 6. It provides enough challenging strategy to entertain adults but it's simple enough for kids/non-gamers to understand and learn fast. Might need a bit of a handicap for the youngest ones (e.g. Allow them to build a 6x6 grid or no build restrictions) but that's it.

Solid mechanics, fast, fun, challenging; a great game for adults and a masterpiece when playing with kids or non-gamers. Thank you Bruno!

RATING: 7
Light and quick, with just enough depth to keep you engaged, super easy to learn and teach, but limited in tile placement by a grid size of either 5x5 or 7x7, which is both good and bad. Adds somewhat to the strategy of tile placement, but also adds arbitrary limits in game length and play style. Feel like Honshu is a stronger game over this one with a very similar theme of map building with the added strategic elements and light production/delivery aspect, and if I had to pick only one, it would be Honshu. Still, both have their place, and Kingdomino will be a light game to start or end the night with, or a quick play for funsies!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light, breezy filler.

Select a tile and play a tile in your 5x5 area. Score points by area size times multiplier symbols in each area of one kind. Turn order is determined by which tile you selected.

That's about all the rules. And still it's pretty fun.

It was hard to pass up a Spiel des Jahres Winner at a discount on Prime Day...

Kingdomino is everything that it says it is, but not much more. The tiles are super thick and kid-friendly. There will always be a place in my heart for tile laying and making everything fit nicely. Unfortunately, I am not sure how many more plays this game will get from me. Definitely a game to teach your children and show to gamers whom have yet to play, but I fret that the latter will grow wearier by the minute.

I kind of bought this on a whim, but I've been loving Cathala's small games so I thought I'd try it. I like it fine, but my wife LOVES this game. Definitely sticking around.

EDIT: Like other Cathala games of this ilk, this has hidden depth. Rating has gone up (though it might be that it's peaking for us) but I really really like it right now. So fast, and the best decision in the game is how picking your tile decides turn order. This is especially true at 4 players, which is my favorite player count for this (even though I do also like the 2 player 7x7). It's like mixing a little El Grande into your super light Carcassonne style game.

RATING: 7
I played a couple of 3-handed games of this SdJ winner. I liked it quite a bit (probably not unrelated to the fact that I won both games), but it does seem to have a little weakness at three players. The tiles are all ranked by their abstract value, but actual value is dependent on what you've built so far--an effect that intensifies toward the end of the game. So if you got the "worst" (lowest numbered) tile, you do get to pick next, but if the tiles are in a cluster, say numbers 22, 23, and 25, their abstract ranks could still mean that you are screwed by getting the "best" tile, which you didn't choose, and which isn't really good for you, and leaving you with the dregs on the next round too. We saw a player suffer that effect for multiple rounds running. It would be mitigated in a four-player game by more options and even further in a two-player game by double drafting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great tile-laying filler game that is great at all player count, even 2-players, with the included variant of playing all the tiles to a 7x7 player's grid instead of the normal 5x5 grid.
++ Great game components: The box insert is thick and of great quality and the tiles are really thick and high quality too.
++ Great game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion, and moreover, that you can use to play (draw the tiles right from the insert).
++ Great price point for the quality of the game components and gameplay.
++ Super easy to teach, super fast to set-up and fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- Lightweight, especially at the 3 and 4 players count using the normal 5x5 grid, as you have less control over the tiles you will get, but still fun for the time frame (which is faster than the 7x7 2-players game).
-- The replayability is somewhat low as once you have played it a bunch (around 10-12 times) you pretty much know how to play the game on auto-pilot.

Kingdomino is a perfectly functional introductory-level game, but not one I found to be very exciting compared to the slew of other great introductory games to the hobby, such as Ticket to Ride, Splendor, Catan, etc.

A very simple game of choosing tiles and playing them to your little kingdom, trying to make large areas of the same landscape types. You can teach the game and be playing within minutes.

Overall, it just didn't get me excited, but I could see pulling it out for a super simple intro to a good family game. Or, if someone suggested, I'd play along as the game isn't bad, and is quick to play.

A great filler that has you building a kingdom out of dominoes. The tiles are nice and thick for how cheap this game is the quality is outstanding. Turn order is determined based on the last tile you picked and you use the tile to build a 5x5 grid using simple connection rules ensuring 1 tile always matches an existing side. Scoring is simple as well number of squares in a contiguous area times the number of crowns in that area. A nice and simple game but with just enough to think about on each turn as you build your kingdom makes this a hit.

I purchased Kingdomino on a whim because it was rated so well. I am glad that I bought it because it is actually more strategic than I at first thought. My husband and I both enjoy tile laying games and this one is no exception. A player really has to think ahead to which tiles he wants to play to maximize his points. For the money this game is definitely worth its price.

Fast, simple, easy tile laying game. If the wife and I want a quick 10 min or less game this one is it. Plays well with 2-4 players and is quick and easy to set up/ take down.

RATING: 6
Very light. It would be a decent game with a couple changes: 1) allowing players to see the tiles coming up on the next round, 2) making the caves less valuable. Without the 1st, it's very difficult to strategize piece placement and falls prey to luck of the draw. Without the 2nd, the player with the most caves usually just wins.

Easy to learn, quick, easy game.
After this many plays seems a reasonable mix between skill and luck.
I have played the three players standard variant, and 5 x 7 kingdoms with one tile missing. 
I have also played two players 7 x 7 kingdoms, and building two 5 x 5 kingdoms per player using two of the same coloured meeples each and having to add one domino per turn to each kingdom.
I don't know why the dominoes have the number on the back. As dominoes they are not easy to shuffle and with the number on the back it is hard not to get a sense where the high numbered dominoes end up in the pack. I think it would be better to have a small number on the front.

Excellent quick tile layer with a draft.  Board dimensions are constrained, and players are only able to look one move ahead, so long term planning isn't possible.  Sometimes tile choice is obvious, but if it isn't it can pay to take the top tile just to ensure first choice in the next round.  I preferred the 3p game to the 2p, but understand there is an advanced 2p game which allows the use of all the tiles.  This sounds like a much better variant.

A puzzle domino game which puts me in mind of Martyn F's Cities and later re-imagining Limes. Kingdomino attempts to make the game more than multiplayer solitaire by having the players claim domino tiles for the next round of placement, thus in theory allowing for blocking moves. This aspect only works for 4 players when all dominos are in play: with less a number are removed at random, thus completely ruining any Bayesian analyses you care to unleash on what remains in the draw pile. It's not a bad little thing, but I think the games by Martyn F are more challenging as they [i]do[/i] allow for Bayesian analyses, and have you factor in claiming of areas too. In Kingdomino they all count automatically, leading to a less satisfying puzzle experience.

This game just cannot stop surprise me. I got it after one positive review from some random guy on youtube channel - and because the Czech version just were released and the price was interesting.
I was surprised how it works - I would never believed that I would enjoy such an easy gateway game. But it is so appealing.
And when it won Spiel des Jahres 2016 price, it became a go to game at this site and everybody wanted to play it. Wow!
This is the game I can play with my non-gamer relatives and still we all having fun despite the difference between our strategic thinking.
This is one of my best filler games - not a main game for the night, but a great opener for sure

What I like:
- Great artwork and production quality. I cannot stress this enough. The colors on dominoes are bright and nice, the size and thickness is good. And the cartoonish mini scenes on the dominoes - love it. I is worth taking the domino and check the details before laying down.
- Quick filler game that provides higher amount of strategy than it seems to do. The rules are really minimalistic and easy grasped so everybody can learn it in few minutes. 
- The tiles draft mechanism is nice - the more powerful domino you take, the last position you will have when choosing dominoes next round.

What I dislike:
- It took some time to shuffle all the dominoes after the game. If you want them to be really shuffled it would cost you some time and energy. I think some sort of big bowl could help but I am afraid whether this would damage the components.
- I would tweak a bit the bonus points - for example only 5 points to complete all dominoes in 7x7 duel game is just too little - it is not worth forcing it just for points. Also the bonus for the castle in the center is not a my thing, I never used it - i believe it just limits your play in a bad way

Components: Fun illustrations; simple and clear iconography.

Experience: Very simple, but entertaining. I enjoy the tile reservation/placement mechanism and the constraint on size of my tile area. Scoring is a bit too simplistic, making it too easy to calculate expected point values of different moves. The final couple of turns are particularly tricky as I have fewer options for matching terrain types. Playing a 7x7 grid with 2 players is especially fun and more difficult to plan.

This game plays quick and there is some decisions to be made in order to be successful but there is the random tiles that might come up and that can kill your game.

[4 Nov 2017] - 6.5 (6 plays)
Most of my plays (5 of them) were done at 3 player tables in a tournament at a local game shop. The 3 player game is unusual in that 12 of the tiles are removed at random and then the game is played with the remaining stack of unknown tiles. More than once games were decided by luck - the tiles removed were of the same type or were all the crown tiles for a given land type. This makes it tough to win when you realize that what you've been building won't work due to the random tiles removed. With 2 and 4 players, all of the tiles are in play and then it becomes a turn order game. I suspect that the game players better this way and my low rating is solely based on the 3 player game. I would like to try the game at 2 and 4 just to compare to my first experience.

Picked this up after its Spiel des Jahres nomination. When I was reading the rules and explaining it, I thought it might be far too light and that I had made a mistake in purchasing it. But this is a terrific, quick filler that has simple rules, but is hard to play well. I enjoy it a lot and am also impressed with the production quality of the components, which is top notch. Outstanding family game. EDIT: just hit my tenth play and I am upping this to a 9. Continues to delight and entertain. We're especially fond of the two player advanced version.

I like dominos and all sorts of tile laying games.  This is both.  The tiles are nice and heavy, for a nice "feel" when handling, and they don't slide around too easily on the table.  the colors are bright and easy to distinguish, and the artwork is cute without being overly so. (I love the Nessie tile!)  Not a huge amount of depth, but a solid, well made filler.

A short sweet game that I will rarely turn down.  It's a Euro game that is put together very well, but with ideas that I've seen many time before, which is why it doesn't rate higher for me.  But I highly recommend it to anyone who is newly entering the hobby.  It's probably the tightest version I've come across of the concept (that 5x5 is much greater than 1x9 even though 5+5 = 1+9.)

A quick and easy family game that combines tile laying, drafting, dominoes, jockeying for turn order, and something similar to King's Breakfast scoring.   Has enough choices to be interesting for the 15 minutes that it lasts.   Might be in the same class as Little Prince Make Me A Planet, but much less vicious.   Good production apart from the super high gloss, and incredibly well priced.

Note:  The 2p 7x7 variant is the best way to play.  Rating for that is probably an 8.

The drafting is more interesting than it first appears, but can lead to players trying to calculate point increases exactly. Otherwise, the game is solid, beautifully produced, puzzly with some interactivity, short, and easy to learn. A good pick by the SdJ jury. Played 5x5 and 7x7 with 2. 7x7 was a touch too long because we kept referring to the tile distribution and counting symbols.

[thing=204583][/thing] surprised me.  I did not pick it up in Essen 2016 as it was simply too simple looking.  But then it won the SDJ, and generally that German jury get their decisions right so I bought a copy for the family holiday.  

And this has been a massive success.  I played my first game 2 weeks ago with the family and we have now played it over 25 times.  I returned from vacation whilst the family carried on holidaying and they have reported that they have carried on playing it non-stop in my absence.  Now, this is unprecedented: games in our household generally only get played when I persuade everyone to sit down and play them.  To think of them all getting around the table to play KingDomino without me there delights me enormously.

What is the key to its success?  Simple rules, interesting binary decisions, and a quick playing time leave us all asking and wanting more and more and more.  We played 8 times in a row one evening.  

Designing a game of such addictive simplicity is one of the toughest of assignments.  All credit to Bruno Cathala.  Amazing.

Easy to play, easy to explain. The components (colors and materials) are great. It's one of the best fillers for recovering of big game sessions.

You have to choose tiles that are arranged, the fewer value tiles make players go first. 

All the tiles have two sides of terrain, and your goal is to connect tiles with the same kind of terrain to gain points (using crowns - some tiles had them for each kind of terrain). 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A light filler that plays around with risk/reward of taking "high value tiles" but paying for it with your turn order position. 

It feels too light for me to really love it, kind of like playing patchwork without the button economy. But, the more I play the more I see what the SDJ judges see in it. 

But it is very quick and light. A good fit along with No Thanks!, Incan  Gold and For Sale. Will probably never turn down a Game, but don't feel the urge to buy a copy. Maybe Queendomino will resonate more with me.

This is a quick game that is perfectly suited for kids, but seems to have some good strategy in it too.  It seems (3 games in) to have a surprising amount of depth considering how fast it is, as you have to make decisions around best pieces, how to fit them, and denying your opponent. It's satisfying to domino your pieces together too.

There are tons of light and fast games out there. Most are playable sound games, even clever at times, but rarely stay their welcome after a few plays. You simply go through the motions of playing the game, as well, filler, until you are ready to play the next 'real' game.

Kingdomino is one of the few filler games I look forward to playing. I am engaged the whole time and excited to see how lucky my Kingdom tiles come together.

A great deal for how much game is in the box at a low price.

RATING: 5
The appeal for Kingdomino is quickly apparent after opening the box and perusing the rules. The game is incredibly quick to learn and play, and a strong candidate for a rinse-and-repeat session. The twelve rounds are enough to temper the luck factor to an acceptable level, and the puzzle of containing your kingdom to a 5x5 grid is satisfying. Players must balance flexible growth with point generating terrain specificity. Its too quick and simple to excite me, but I'd understand if I am in the minority.

RATING: 7
Cute and fast. It's fun to build your kingdom and the draft is different. I wonder if players will memorize what some of the numbers tiles are after a few plays, but this isn't a big deal. I'd love to try the sequel...

In Kingdomino, you are a Lord seeking new lands in which to expand your kingdom. You must explore all the lands, wheat fields, lakes, and mountains in order to spot the best plots. But be careful as some other Lords also covet these lands...

Dominoes with a kingdom building twist. Each turn, connect a new domino to your existing kingdom, making sure at least one of its sides connects to a matching terrain type already in play. The game mechanics for obtaining the tiles is clever: the order of who picks first depends on which tile was previously chosen. Make sure to secure tiles with crowns- these royal treasures help to multiply the worth of your kingdom at the end of the game! The game ends when each player has completed a 5x5 grid, and then points are counted based on number of connecting tiles and crowns.

Tile laying game with the twist of everyone has their own "kingdom" and you draft the tiles each turn.  Had a slight carcassonne feel with matching up tiles and building up sections of your kingdom.  The game is pretty simplistic and frankly felt a little monotonous to me, was kinda waiting for it to end about halfway through.

Fast playing, cute little game that I could play anytime no problem but doesn't really excite me. Best part of it is the tile artwork and I might re-acquire in future just for that. At present though it doesn't serve any purpose in my collection and I'd rather try something different.

-------------Original rating 29/03/17 Score:7.5
[b]Rating based on - 5+ plays, 2 player[/b]
A sweet little tile drafting and placement game where the trade off is that when you draft a more valuable tile for yourself, your opponent will have the option of going earlier in turn order thereby getting first pick of the tiles in the next round. The game has simple rules with added variants, specific rules for 2 players, is quick, has excellent components (I especially like the very thick tiles and the artwork on them), and the Blue Orange box is appropriately sized. It's about the size of the Kosmos/Z-Man/Mayfair 2 player games boxes. I'm not sure why it doesn't come with a draw bag though. Yes, you're supposed to use the box, but seeing as you can see the numbers on the back I'd think anybody with an eidetic memory could cherry pick tiles to their advantage if they wanted. You get a sense of satisfaction seeing your little kingdom come together in front of you, and you need to be spatially aware as not only do you have to place your current domino, but plan to place the one for the next round, as well as keeping your options open. A solid family game.

On our first session we had two standard 5x5 games of this back to back. We shuffled the tiles, divided them into 2 piles and played with first one set then the other. Our second session was the Mighty Duel which is the 7x7 end game goal suggested for 2 players. This one is a bit fairer to 2 players because all of the tiles are in play during the game and you can build while waiting for a specific tile to come out. It was...cute. Enjoyable. I have nothing against it really – no negatives, but a couple of times I caught myself thinking about playing [thing=1545][/thing] instead so that can't be good...I guess it just left me wanting a little bit more. I'm thinking this would be great to play with kids and non-gamers as it's really easy to get into and not so long they'd feel overwhelmed. If you like games like [thing=183251][/thing], then you might want to check this one out. Also suitable if you'd like a light, relaxing game at the end of the day. [thing=165662][/thing] as well as a couple of others already fill this niche for me though. Going forward, we definitely always had to play the 7x7. There just wasn't much in it for me playing the 5x5. We also played the other included variants which was a nice break from the standard game, but nothing earth shattering and it didn't really alter our gameplay. Apparently an expansion is in the works for this one, but is it worth waiting for?

CARCASSONNE heiratet DOMINO in einem bunten Märchenschloss auf Speed. Damit ist KINGDOMINO bereits umrissen. Für ein Spiel, das alle an den Tisch bringen soll, hat KINGDOMINO alles, was es braucht: eine Mini-Idee in Hochglanz-Schokoladenpapier und einem Regelwerk aus einer Minute. Und was das Wichtigste ist: KINGDOMINO hat eine bunte Seele dank seiner hervorragenden Art Direction, und zwar eine liebe, süße Prinzessinenseele mit einem kleinen, völlig überflüssigen Mini-Neuschwanstein aus dem Überraschungsei von Ferrero in der Mitte. Fast möchte man dem Mini-Spiel alles Gute für den Weihnachtsverkauf wünschen, wäre da nicht die nüchterne Gewissheit, das auch das Liebe und Honigsüsse in der Spieleindustrie nur eine Luftschloss-Ware im massenhaften Familiensektor ist. KINGDOMINO ist der Konsens für Nichtspieler. Der Schatten des Drachen auf der Wiese und das Ungeheuer im Wasser ist Game of Thrones für den Kindergarten, die Spinne im Wald Herr der Ringe.

Very simple, quick game. Plays 4-player in about 20 minutes. Simple take a tile, place it in your little "kingdom.' After all tiles are placed, total your score. Scoring is done by counting the number of fields you created of each type and multiply by the numer of crowns in each type of field. Good for an opener (while waiting for late-comers) or a quick closer.

A surprise winner from Bruno Cathala! (Not that I'm surprised he designed a winning game - but what to expect from a kiddy-looking game from Blue Orange?)  Kingdomino is super-fast and quite light but the way it plays out is fantastic. Some push-your-luck, a little spatial challenge, a great semi-drafting and bidding for turn order next time thing... all and all I would say this could be a strong contender for the Kinderspiel des Jahres.  Luck might win the day for you, but it's clear that a good player will beat a weaker player almost every time. For what it is, this is a top-notch game!

A wonderful and original game that is perfect for families. My wife, son, and I play Kingdomino just about every night, and although my son is only 6-years-old, this game has escalated his knowledge of math and multiplication. It was stretched his mind in so many unique ways, and it has made our "game night" time so much more special. 

The box is small but provides such a grand game within it. The quality of all the tiles are top-notch, and the artwork is simple yet adorable. I couldn't recommend this game enough! For the price, it is absolutely one of the best tabletop games on the market today.

Hm, I was waiting forever for a wheat crown tile. Bad luck that 4 of 5 were put out of the game. So no chance for me. I guess it's better when all tiles are in the game.

4 player game was a better experience than the 3 player one.

I get a similar feeling to Coloretto: Only a couple of decisions, but they're good ones. Very streamlined. Best at 2p: harder to get stuck going last and more to think about. Placing your previously selected tile only after selecting a new tile is a nice wrinkle, which is amplified in the 2p game. The spatial puzzle of the game rewards planning ahead to keep your options open and maximize scoring. Accommodates children and adults together nicely. 7x7 2p variant is great and makes for a more challenging game. I may prefer playing 3p variant with four tiles to chose from (discarding the untaken tile). 2p (especially 7x7!) elevates the game to 8; otherwise 7.5. Rating reduced slightly: I still like it, but there's just not enough depth here to keep it really interesting.

RATING: 6
Components: amazing components
Complex: easy to teach and learn
Weight: family
Players: 2 or 3
Length: no more than 30 mins
Mechanics: tile placing
Decisions: which tile to put in your kingdom and how you put it
Opinion: not a bad family game to play with the family. You have a kingdom and you aim to fill it with tiles, trying to put together tiles of the same type of terrain and with crowns, as you will score for the crowns and tiles of the same type together.
You have 4 tiles, and one of them is for you, once you place it, just select the one you will need on the next turn, determining also your turn order for the next one. So, in a nutshell, place a tile, select the one you need later.
If you are the last in turn order, no much options, as you will only have one. And you have to go for a big group of tiles of the same terrain, containing as much crowns as you can.
Good game to play sometimes with non gamers. Will try to play it with my son once he reaches 4

RATING: 8.5
Yes, it's very simple. But it's also very fast and addictive, one game is never enough. The brilliance of this game lies in its simplicity, but also its appearance, which perfectly matches the game-play. Magic Maze is more innovative and, in my opinion, should have won the Spiel des Jahres, but I also understand why Kingdomino is such a hit.

While I was hoping Wettlauf nach El Dorado would win the Spiel des Jahres, I'm not disappointed this one won, because it is a very good game. It's super easy to setup, explain, and teach, and the decisions (while not grueling) are real. It is a nearly perfect tile-laying filler game, and it's one I'm happy to play anytime it's suggested (and I imagine I'll continue suggesting we play it for some time to come).

Deserved winner of the Spiel des Jahres. Quick, easy to teach and play game. However, it has some good decisions in it. Fun tile-laying puzzle element. Interesting scoring. Good turn order mechanism.

I think I prefer it with two. The tile selection is more interesting when both players have two meeples. However, it is good with 4 as well. 3p loses something as you will not see 25% of the tiles. This introduces a good bit of randomness to the game that removes a lot of the strategy and planning.

A simple and fun tile drafting game where each player is trying to get the tiles to build the best kingdom they can. The rules are easy to teach and the scoring is straightforward.

It's super quick at 2 players, but luckily there are several variants and one of them extends the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Awful with 3; turn order matters less (fewer tiles to choose from) and luck of the draw more (do the crowns for your landscape come out at all? no?). With 4 it can still be frustrating that someone stumbled onto gold mine tiles while everybody else was playing a slightly more methodical game, but it's fast, VERY fast, and boils the "how much is first pick worth to you" dilemma found in other games down to a relatively tasty center.

Easy to learn, but a lot of good decisions. The only minor thing was that I felt that it would have been nice with a final choice for the last player each round.

A quick game with tile drafting, tile placement, and a few different ways to optimize point scoring. Kingdomino can be played in approximately 15 minutes, and we almost always play a few times in a row.

Easy to teach and plays quickly! It is very rare for people I game with to ever play the same game twice in a row, but this has happened several times with this one.

I prefer playing 2-player with the 7x7 kingdom space (if both people have played before) or 4-player. In both configurations, all tiles are seen so it's more possible to judge the value/waiting to build things.

EDIT: In the variants section, someone suggested playing 3-player essentially like 4-player (4 tile options in display), only the tile not selected is just removed from the game. This makes it so even in 3-player, all tiles are seen at some point.

Love this game. The concept is simple, the mechanics are simple and yet there is depth to the strategy. 

But the big reason I rank it high is because my 8 yr old loves it and I can see that for a kid his age the depth is really there and the need to think ahead and strategize makes this actually close to a brain burner for someone his age. I appreciate that, as far as a game for families and for my son, it is a very quick game, 10-15 min. This is great for an 8 yr old who is really thinking hard about strategy, because if he messes up or his strategy implodes, he gets to try again really soon; can't emphasise enough what a big deal this is when introducing games to kids.

All in all a great game, fun and one of my families favorites.

Add in the beautiful tiles and quick playing time and you get a versatile little filler that I can pull out with non gamers and gamers of young and old. A very elegant design and a worthy spiel des jahres winner.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (December 2017)

As winner of the 2017 Spiel des Jahres prize, I was extremely skeptical about the game. I also (generally) don’t enjoy most Bruno Cathala´s designs so my desire to play the game was extremely low. The opportunity to play it arose this month and I was right. The game is pleasant enough, but it is very simple and very light.

Kingdomino´s rules are very easy to teach, you can do it under 2 minutes. Playtime is around the 20 minute mark.

The art of the game is pretty good, the components are ok.

Gameplay is very light and obvious. There is a lot of luck with the tiles and I guess you can mitigate it a little bit if you know the tiles beforehand, still, it is mostly a tactical endeavor. The best play is obvious all the time. Perhaps it can be a little deeper with 2 players, but I’m not 100% sure this is the case, luck could increase a lot in that configuration.

Bottom line, I recognize that Kingdomino is a great game for families, casual gamers or new gamers, but it is way too light for my current tastes. I could play again if requested but only because it plays so fast. I already sold my copy of the game. Boring game with lots of luck.

Current Rating: 4.0

RATING: 8
At first glance, it didn't seem really fun... And after a few games, it gets really exciting, you start to anticipate your strategy. It becomes a pleasure to discover new tiles each turn and creating little patches of land in your kingdom. I like it best with 2 players, where you can create larger kingdoms – me and my girlfriend keep playing it!

What a great little game. It's simple enough that my 5 year old can play with us, and fast enough that she doesn't get bored. It has a nice level of strategy, but the individual puzzles mean that the kids don't get bitter when they lose.  Easily one of the best family games in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very simple game, but with enough meaningful decisions to be worth playing, for sure. Players build a 5x5 tableau of two-square, domino-type tiles consisting of one or two landscape types. Each turn you draft a tile and select the tile you will draft the next turn. Tiles are ordered so that the better tiles will have you going later in turn order for your next round. Some tiles have from 1-3 crowns on them and at the end of the game you score for each landscape area - number of squares times the number of crowns. That's the entire game right there! Building out a better tableau while jockeying for turn order is good fun. The length of the game, 15 minutes, is perfect for the weight.

UPDATE: Raised to an 8. Everyone who I have played this with has really enjoyed it. A worthy Spiel winner.

The King demands domino style tile laying! This is a very simple game of drafting tiles to add to a personal tableau. There are different terrain types and sometimes a terrain will show one or two crowns. At the end of the game each region in your tableau scores points equal to its area times the number of crowns it contains.

There are a couple of variant scoring conditions which seem necessary. Extra points for making a perfect 5x5 square, and extra points for finishing with your starting castle in the center of the grid.

There is not much to think about in the game, it's a simple exercise of choosing a tile and placing it. The game is quick to get going and doesn't last long. It's a perfectly inoffensive filler game. I don't think there's anything interesting enough to bring me back to the game. If someone were keen to play I would be happy to join but I won't be looking to play this.

If you want a fast and easy filler game, especially one that would work well with non-gamers and children then this game might fit the bill.

Found this game to be very underwhelming considering all of the hype. Gameplay is simple and straightforward but it feels like you just place tiles based on what shows up and the choices you can make are very limited.

I feel as though families looking for a board game or two should start with the following:

1) Sushi Go Party / Kingdomino / Between Two Cities
2) King of Tokyo / Ticket to Ride (whichever appeals more)
3) Star Realms / Hero Realms

From buying something from the 1, 2, and 3, lists above you will have a baseline from which to know what types of games your family enjoys. Sushi Go Party and Kingdomino are both very cheap and play well with younger kids. Between Two Cities plays just as well with kids but costs a bit more. King of Tokyo and Ticket to Ride are very different, but I feel as though you will gravitate towards one. Like rolling dice? Yes, King of Tokyo has lots of dice rolling. Not particularly, well then let me introduce you to the well-themed euro-style gaming world with Ticket to Ride. Star Realms (or Hero Realms) works so well with two (and is cheap) that it makes a perfect gateway into deck-building style games.

Wow, this is such an amazing filler. Every turn you have a though decision. Do you take the tile that maximizes your points, do you block someone or do you just go for the first tile since most of the tiles don't really help that much and there might be a more valuable tile waiting in the next round. I love the quick but satisfying feel of building your kingdom. This is my most played game after 2 months for a reason. It is a wonderful filler that I won't get bored and play it over and over again since every new game is a puzzle you must solve. I recommend it to everyone. I just love it.

If board games were foods, Kingdomino would be potato chips — light, appealing, and leaves your craving more. After my first play through I could see why Kingdomino won the Spiel des Jahres. There is little to dislike in the game: simple tile laying, a brilliant turn order system, drafting, and an intuitive scoring system. All of these mechanisms are very much adored at the moment. Master designer Bruno Cathala has crafted a true gem.

Ejha, ez jócskán meglepett. Nem sok jót reméltem a játék címe alapján, de azért Bruno Cathala neve mégis valamiféle minőséget sugall. Az a fajta szabályrendszer jellemző a Kingdominóra, amit imádok, egyszerű, pár perces szabályok, közben rengeteg variációs lehetőség, és talán nem túlzás azt mondani, hogy van benne némi mélység. A változó játékossorend rendszer is egyszerű, de nagyszerű. Összességében le a kalappal, ez egy olyan játék, amit szerintem már 6-7 évesekkel is simán lehet játszani, miközben gémereknek is élvezetes lehet.

Very straightforward filler. If played as a multiplayer solitair it is a 5. However trying to pick a tile that your opponent wants is often not a good strategy. 
Lucky enough it is easy to keep track of things.
Because of the tile selection process , if in doubt which tile to pick your best bet without wasting too much time is to pick the lowest numbered tile.

The fact that it is so straightforward means that this is not a gamers filler.
For gamers this is a 5, for families it is close to an 8

This game is savagely under-rated.  It's light but probably less than currently rated (I win more than 50% of my 4 players games).  This is my sleeper hit of 2016.  Plays super fast, ultra accessible yet fun for gamers, incredible production value for the price, more depth than people give it credit for.  Building your kingdom is quite satisfying and balancing tile power with selection power works super well while not really requiring any explanation.  I really love this little game.  Of course it's not Vinhos, or one of those uber heavy euro that the BGG crowds (and myself) like a lot, but damn I was really impressed by Kingdomino.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I think this will be old quickly but it is interesting in the mean time. It is simply placing tiles in a 5x5 grid following certain placement rules and then scoring the product of the number of crowns in the terrain area and the number square regions in the terrain area. I'd advise preventative play in that you must block opponents at times.

I think enjoy this game more for it's interesting drafting mechanic than actually placing the tiles! But it's all a lot of fun. And what's even better is that the game is fun with 2, 3 or 4 players. Each player count offers different challenges which increases the replayability.

4 Dominosteine liegen in der Tischmitte. Der Spieler der letzte Runde den schwächsten Stein nehmen musste hat jetzt die erste Wahl. der 2. die zweite usw.
Die gewählten Steine werden dann ins eigene Königreich eingebaut. Legeregel: Eine Seite muss passen, die anderen Seiten sind egal. Und das bebaute Feld darf eine maximale Größe von 5x5 Feldern haben.
Abrechnung: Anzahl der Felder eines gleichfarbigen Gebietes multipliziert mit der Anzahl Kronen im Feld = Punkte.
Sehr nettes kleines Einstiegs oder Absackerspiel. Schnell erklärt (in 5 Minuten Regel gelesen, in 2 Minuten erklärt). Einfaches Prinzip.
Gefällt mir wirlich gut.

Kingdomino is the game to beat for Spiel de Jahres this year. It immediately feels familiar since it's similar to playing dominoes. The constraint to stay within a 5x5 grid produces a satisfying challenge to tackle. The components and art are really well done. I especially liked subtle items in scenes on the tiles which made me smile when I found them. Overall, it's a great game that should appeal to a very wide audience. My only complaint is that the second king meeple (used in the two player game) should have been a queen instead.

A good light-weight game. Good for families.

Pros:
- Turn order decision is interesting.
- A unique take on dominos
- Additional rules add additional depth with very little complexity.
- Rules are succinct and get out of the way.
- Values for certain resource types are asymmetric leading to interesting gameplay and even favors heuristically suboptimal choices.

Cons:
- Turn order favors first player.
- Short shelf life, too simple
- Lots of uncertainty and randomness when playing with less than 4 players, as 2 and 3 player games remove a considerable amount of tiles.

This game is worth every bit of the Spiel das Jahres award it earned. While creating a 5x5 grid is the standard play, the 7x7 duel was much more fun.  Still, both ways provide a lot of enjoyment.  I just wish the dominoes were plastic instead of cardboard as I'm already starting to notice a little wear.  I'd pay more for a deluxe version like that.

Kingdomino is a very neat domino tile laying game. First thought it might be too simple for my taste, but I enjoy playing it nonetheless as an entertaining filler, plus girlfriend likes it because she beats me. I keep playing it sometimes when my girlfriend and I wants to squeeze a really quick game.

Maybe the most intuitive game I've ever played. Kingdomino is contagious; everyone I show this game to either has bought it or wants to keep playing. This is the litmus test for fillers in my collection. It's hard to play other fillers when Kingdomino is this quick, intuitive, and has the right amount of strategy.

I also bought this game before it won Spiel Des Jahres. That statement proves nothing and is moderately pretentious.

Great game at 4 and 2 players (with 7x7 variant).  I only wish the tile numbers had been blank on the back, using a draw bag to get better mixing without knowing upcoming tiles.

RATING: 6
I kind of wish there was a variant where the different terrain types scored differently, and I'm not sure about replayability, but this is a really easy to learn short game that while not brain burny still requires you to consider multiple layers between the tile types, where you can place, and turn order.

Numbingly simple tile laying game.  Despite the drafting system, still favors random luck and top decks more than it should need to, probably because the game is actually very short.  Don't get me wrong; I've won every game I've played of this, so I'm not jaded.  I just think there are any interesting choices.

Kingdomino takes dominoes and an older game called Cities to the next level.  You get a two sided tile that you initially orient to your castle.  There are 6 different types of terrain and each side has a different terrain type.  You place your marker on the tile you want to claim and they are ordered from most to least valuable.  On subsequent turns you select based on the order of the tile you selected from least valuable to most valuable which assumes.  If you got a good time before, you likely get a crummy one later.  You place against common colors but must make a 5 by 5 grid.  Territories with the same colors score score for each square with the same color that are in the same area and then you multiply by the number of crowns in that area.  

The game is good but pretty light.  I don't find myself really wanting to play again.  It is nice but after 4-5 plays, I would have explored all I need to know about the game.

A solid, simple game. Not a brain burner, but does get you thinking, considering, and strategizing. There is only so much you can do, but it will be different every time. I will enjoy playing this every time. It’s nice to add something to the collection that can just be picked up and played without ages of setup, but still offers such a satisfying experience. Something should be said for the quality of the pieces, too. The tiles have a luxury about them that makes holding them a real pleasure, and cool little details in the artwork that are quirky and fun to look for.

Oh, this is good. Light, but also unforgiving. The mechanic of sorting tiles less-likely to have crowns on them to the front of the line is brilliant, encouraging interesting decisions about turn order vs. tile choice.

In my first game, I enjoyed deciding where to place tiles -- and I frequently shot Future Martin in the foot with my placements. I blocked my daughter once, but couldn't play that tile myself; that's an interesting choice.

There's a neat rhythm to this game, and it's invitingly simple. I like it. I'm also impressed that it takes the core of a game I don't enjoy in the least bit, Dominoes, and makes a good game around it. Having tried it with two, I can't wait to see how it does with 3+.

Lovely components, to boot. Thick, thick tiles, king meeples, and a neat little castles -- all in a good insert.

---

It took me until play 5 to realize that prioritizing matches above all is a great approach. By play 7 I'd clocked my best score ever, 50, and only missed filling two spots.

The economy of this design is brilliant. Every decision matters, and everything is so tight that every play counts. I've still got things to discover about how to play it well, too; it's got more depth than its light weight might suggest.

---

10 plays in, re-rated from an 8 to a 9. I suggest this one all the time, I'm still terrible at it, but I love slowly getting better (and losing is fun, too).

A little too light/simple for my tastes (feels like a simplified carcassone - draft tiles, place to score points; this game is a bit more solitaire though). Had a bit of fun, but can't see myself asking to play again. Decent choice if playing with young kids.

RATING: 7
My intial impression is that this is a feather-light grid/tile-laying game. Pretty good. The problem I have with a game like this is that you need more than 2 players for it to be at it's best, but if I had 3+, I don't know if I would ever pull this one off the shelf. Solid, and will hopefully improve with more plays. That said, I like Karuba better  and they feel rather similar (plus Karuba plays better at 2). Good but not great so far.

I like Kingdomino. It's a simple game of building a grid from tiles that you select in a changing turn order from round to round. Matching colors (or land types) will cause you to score points at the end of the game if you have at least one "crown" marker in those areas. Most points wins. This game can be played several times in one night.

An absolute wonderful tile game that takes dominoes and makes it into something more accessible and engaging. Every round one tile is laid out per player (or two per player if you play with two), ranged numerically from 'worst' to 'best'. You choose in player order and what you choose both determines what tile you get and what the player order will be next turn.

This game works really well with any player amount, but really shines the most when playing the 2-player variant rules where you use all the tiles and built into a 7x7 grid rather than the regular 5x5.

I am the greatest Kingdomino player in the history of the playing of Kingdomino, a game which for some reason I keep typing as Kindgomino. I think that would be a good game name, too.

I say that I am the greatest because I am 1-0. Also because the game was played more or less against my will late at night when I would rather have been playing something good. And yet I triumphed anyway. 

Someone, an adult even, told me this is not a kid's game. I'm pretty sure he was just making that up, though. No one would believe that, right? Right?

Great for what it is...

This a family-weight game for which the rules are intuitive and fade into the background within minutes of starting your first play.   There are then light but interesting decisions to make. and the game moves along briskly.

In fact, the game time is short enough that you can (and will want to) rip off a "best-of-three" series of games whenever you have 30-45 minutes to game.

I like this because it has push your luck elements but it uses domino like tile laying system to place your dominoes.

I liked this. Whenever the Dominoes mechanism is used in games, I really dig it. This is better than Sapiens, if only because you can deny others tiles a little more easily. I like the fact that you can go for sprawling areas of land or go for a few multi-star tiles, and it usually evens out pretty well. I had a lot of fun playing, but I don't know that one game will be different enough from the next to warrant repeated plays.

Fantastic game. The beauty is in the simplicity. Trying to make sure you stay in a 5x5 grid, picking the right tile, and ending up with a really neat, different, kingdom every time. However, it scales well to a more strategic group. You can play the defensive  game and keep others from getting their tiles. You can collect crowns and have a small area, or do the opposite with a big area and a few crowns. Games are always close, and even when you lose it doesn't feel like you lost because you still made a kingdom and have something to show for your efforts. We love to play this game at the end of the night to help us come down after much more challenging games.

In this filler, players are attempting to build a 5 X 5 board, with a starting single spot, and from 1 X 2 tiles that you get. A number of tiles equal to the number of players are available to get. Generally the more valuable tiles are at the end. In player order, players choose a tile, but the further up in the queue they are, they get to go first in choosing for next round. The tiles are a mixture of multipliers, and terrain. You score for the multipliers and if the multipliers are adjacent to the right terrain. 

It's fun to play, and there is strategy as you try to collect multipliers, perhapds denying someone else, and vying for turn order the next round. You are also trying to build your board without ruining your future prospects. I enjoyed this and happy to play more. It reminded me of a faster version of Isle of Skye.

Enjoyable tile placing game. I found the game play slightly clunky. We played with 3 people, built our little kingdoms, played it again, and that was it. No one was blown away, we never faced truly hard decisions, and no one interacted with another person in such a way that it caused utter havoc or a game winning condition. If you didn't see a tile you wanted, take the one that gave you top spot next turn. If you did see a good one, grab it. Lay out your kingdom by spreading some arms so you can place almost any tile by turn 5 and that's the game. 

This might be a good game to play with kids as a family in the same way that Machi Koro is an excellent game to play with the family, however being a family game with easily likeable colours and graphics alone shouldn't earn it top marks.

[b]Kingdomino[/b] 

[i][COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10 -> [b]10[/b]):[/color]

[i]Kingdomino has gone on to be one of my favorite filler games. It is extremely accessible and creates a very clever gameplay experience with a handful of rules. Kingdomino is an excellent SDJ winner that can easily be learned by someone not in the hobby; it would make an excellent gateway game for a lot of families [i](my 7yo daughter has picked up the rules without any problem)[/i]. Definitely highly recommended![/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]13 plays in one month speaks to how quick and easy this is to get to the table. I prefer either the advanced 2p game or the 4p game since you will be playing with all the tiles. Playing the regular 2p or 3p game means tiles are randomly removed which can really hose you because you don't know the value of certain landscapes at that point. That said this is a great filler game, the combination of tile laying with a draft is so simple and executed perfectly because your tile selection also determines what order you will be drafting the next tile. Kingdomino plays quickly and is packed with meaningful decisions making it a great intro into the hobby.

Another plus is the amount of player interaction as you compete for certain tiles, either to help score you points or avoid giving your opponent a bunch of points. The constraints of having to build in a grid is also a challenge as you try and optimize your scoring opportunities. All this leads up to Kingdomino being one of my favorite new to me games of the year, this game knocks it out of the park. Kingdomino has become one of my favorite filler games that I'll always keep in my bag and I can't recommend it highly enough.[/i]

Silly game. Conceptual is is Domino 2.0, but the implementation is still basic and not balanced. There are too many times that you have no influence on which cards you get, simply because there are crowns on the cheapest cards and first players remain first, giving others no option to compete.

Pleasant enough to play if someone brings it to the table, but the decisions are not interesting enough to seek it out or buy it myself. Choose a tile from the draft and add it to your tableau, wanting tiles with crown symbols (your score multipliers) and to link terrain together to make big tracts of similar terrain (your other score multiplier). Repeat. The tile you pick also dictates the order of choosing in the next round (the least valuable, the earlier). The recurring decisions are simple, but enough to keep you engaged for the 10 minutes or so it takes to play. But I'd class this as more of a waiting game. As in, ok, let's do this while we're waiting before we can start a real game.

Based on one play: A nice play on dominoes where you collect tiles and have to match one side to attach it to your kingdom. Your kingdom can never be larger than a five by five grid, so placement is key as you try to make large sets and add multipliers (crowns) to the sets. Cute and simple game with some nice artwork and materials.

A simple but engaging tile laying game that essentially takes dominoes and turns into an accessible hobby game.  The scoring system and the turn order/drafting mechanism provides a nice challenge without over complicating matters.  The entire package is enhanced by several included variants.

Kingdomino is a super-light tile-drafting game. Each turn, players will draft two 2x1 "domino" tiles, each side of which depicts a terrain type and optionally a house. Players arrange the drafted tiles onto their 5x5 area, and at the end of the game, each region of similar tiles will score points equal to the size of the region multipled by the number of houses in that region. There's really no costing of the tiles except for future turn order. This game is way too light for me--I kept wanted to auction the tiles at the very least.

Just kind of "meh". You get a tile each turn and you place it trying to maximize the points you get in a 5x5 grid. That's about it. I have no idea how this got so much hype.

The game was quick to setup and teach.  It had simple rules with some strategy of what tiles to go for and place.  

The game didn't have too much depth, especially with four players playing.  Generally just maximized areas based on crowns.

RATING: 8
I've only played it 2p. It's one of those fun light spatial games you can play over lunch or as a filler. The 5x5 grid game using half the tiles feels about like Mintworks or LoveLetters, which is to say that it's over quickly and gives a nice little "fun-buzz". But the 7x7 option is where this game really shines for 2p. The larger grid allows multiple strategies of scoring, blocking opponents, and the length also makes turn order more important which makes the tile drafting element a lot more interesting and it's still short enough to be a lunch/filler. The 2p 7x7 game is an absolutely great filler.

First time we were surprised by the short playing time.

Second time we played was decent.

Third time? It had lost its charm.

I'll still play it when in the mood, mostly since it's quite quick or with younger players, but otherwise I'll go for "Honshu" or "The Little Prince: Make Me a Planet".

I haven't played "Queendomino" yet, which adds complexity and may make it more interesting, but the consensus seems to be that it makes "Kingdomino" unnecessary.

A lot of interesting decisions to be made through the course of the game, and the ability to force other people into disadvantageous positions as well. Love that.

One of those games that, like King of Tokyo is successful because of non-gamers.

Quick, lighter family friendly, Domino drafting and tile laying. Simple to teach and play, appeals to wide age range.
2P Variant is a little more strategic (which is welcome). I wish it could accommodate more players, but at such a low price, buying 2 copies isn't unreasonable. Others have said it's a "hyper light, hyper fast cousin to Isle of Skye" and I like that comparison.

RATING: 7
This is a really quick playing tile layer. The general idea is each player has a pawn. Tiles get revealed equal to the number of players, and then from top to bottom, players chose a new tile to take and add to their tableau. Then you reveal a new set and do it again. The player's tableau can't exceed a 5x5 grid, and you score each contiguous region depending on it's size times the number of printed crown icons in that feature. It's got a few interesting choices in terms of which tile you take. You want tiles that will add to your features, because if you can't extend a feature with your new tile, then you aren't allowed to place it. However, if you take the last tile in the row, then you are forced to chose last on the next tile pull. Not only that, you have to watch your opponents, and not feed them tiles they need. It has nice components and it actually does play in 15-20 minutes or less with non-ap players.

I have only played 2-player so far, but it has been a fun, quick, and surprisingly interesting game. The normal 5x5 variant is pleasant, but things can get dicey at the end if you didn't plan correctly and can't fit your last tile. I would rate the base version with normal rules a 6. The 7x7 variant is amazing and probably gets a slightly better rating. It requires much more planning in order to not discard tiles that don't fit at the end. I also believe that the other variant scoring rules such as keeping your castle in the middle and having no holes should be used every game to up the difficulty.

Customized dominoes any one? 
A very light drifting game. Each turn players draft a tile that must fit in a 5x5 grid. Like dominoes the tile must match to an existing tile. Scoring at the end of the game is the size of each region time the number of houses in the region. The only twist it the turn order for the next turn is set by the order tiles select from the current turn. 
Way too light for me, I'd just rather play dominoes.

This is such a smart yet simple game. The rules can be learned in practically a minute, yet the gameplay is engaging and there are plenty of meaningful decisions to be making. It isn't incredibly deep, but there is still a good amount of skill and it plays fairly quickly. I'm always having fun playing this and look forward to many more plays. I can see this game possibly raising even higher in my rankings if a little more depth starts to emerge as my skill improves.

Pick a domino tile and try to match it with other tiles in your little kingdom to score points. But remember that if you pick a good tile, you will probably go late in the next round. Pick a bad tile in hope something better will come up and you will be going first. And that's about it, folks!

Very qucik, very simple but still fun filler/family game. Doesn't do anything new, but merges beautiful art and great component quality with few rules, short play time and at least some semblance of strategy. Almost each round gives some interesting choices and while I believe the final outcome has lots to do with luck, it doesn't bother me in a short game like this.

Great filler game.  Quick, yet surprisingly engaging.  The decisions you need to make will keep you on your toes....to get a slightly better tile this round you need to sacrifice your ability to go first in the next round (when the dream tile may come out).

Definitely a buy recommendation for this one.  Good art, nice thick tiles, great game play.

You can play a 5x5 grid (with 2P, 3P, or 4P).  You can play a 7x7 grid (with 2P...uses all the tiles).  Or you can print a tile which allows you to play a 6x6 grid (with 2P or 3P).

Very good 2-player game (in the 7x7 version). Don't be fooled by the 5x5 "beginner variant" - once you go to the full size game, it becomes really fun and just the right amount of challenge. Quick set up and 15-20 minute gameplay - a rare gem if you're looking for a short but engaging 2-player experience.

Note: This game is really not that good with 3 players, as not all tiles will be used, which makes the game way too random. A central part of this game is knowing what tiles are still available so you can plan your steps, however, this does not exist with 3 players. Should really only be played with 2 (advanced version) or with 4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Now here is some good, wholesome, elegant design that is a class above most entry-level fillers. When building your 5x5 kingdom (7x7 in a two-player game), there is a spatial planning aspect to the game where maintaining "harmony" and keeping your castle centered is a fun challenge in itself. Cathala's genius is showing, as he successfully marries simple gameplay with "crunchy" bidding decisions to give players pause when considering between pick-priority and tile value. The amount of player interaction is much more indirect and limited than I like, but it does not mar my enjoyment. 

(+) Elegant gameplay
(+) Vibrant artwork and attention to detail (the same forest tiles, for example, have unique touches of artwork on them)
(+) Accessible to players of varied skill levels

(-) Minimal player interaction
(-) Subject to luck of the draw, but the lighthearted nature of the game lends to this.
(-) Rather simple gameplay. Such is the case for many a filler.

It's mildly pleasing, but ultimately way too random.  In 5x5 games, the person who gets mines wins.  In 7x7 2-player games, the other regions start to be interesting, but the game is 0-sum so it's just math what tiles to take.  In general, your plays are pretty obvious once your tableau starts to build, and the endgame is anticlimactics.

For kids, the game is way too mathy.  Even for adults it is a chore to compute your score, and you really have to do that (twice) every turn in a 2 player game.

I don't understand what the fuss is all about.  It seems to miss the boat with both adults and kids.

RATING: 5
After one play the game seems above average. It's easy to play and the rules are very simple but not to a point where there's no strategy involved.  You collect tiles and try to build the best 5x5 grid you can.  However, there seems to be something missing and I didn't feel excited playing this. It just seems very plain with no unique mechanics or gimmicks.  Feels underwhelming considering it won the Spiel des Jahres

looks like muliplayer solitaire, and it quacks like a duck, but there is certainly crunchy player interaction with the bidding of turn order. the goal is pretty much to make the most homogeneous domino kingdom. the more of something you have, the more you want. obviously, other players may see you have all the oceans (for instance) and deny you more, but you'll often have plenty of choices. interaction is NOT take-take (no stealing, discards, skips). great optional rules for more challenge. works equally well with 2, 3, & 4 players and is somewhat wind-resistant! also, it does not depend heavily on playing with people your own age and offers challenge even when playing against children or muggles (although, an experienced player will very likely win).

Yes this game is really simple and will get repetitive if you play it multiple times in a row.  But, it is a great gateway game.  The chunky dominoes are really appealing and (shock) not cards or dice.  The colors are crisp and bright and make it easy to understand scoring (and feel like you are really creating a landscape).  The best thing about this game is that I was able to include multiple generations of family members in a single game and everyone had the capability to win.

For what it is (a light, short tile laying domino game), Kingdomino is an absolutely brilliant game.  I especially love the 7x7 variant at 2 players.  I've only given 2 games a 10 rating: Twilight Struggle and Kingdomino.  That should speak to how well designed this game is.  And don't let the lightness fool you. There is a good bit of strategy in this one.

In a way Splendour won...

Kingdomino - like Splendour - has heavy euro level of interaction, better framed as interference where steps of different plans by different players start stumbling and circumnavigating one another. But mostly you're focused on your own thingy, tableau, player plateau or whatever it's called. Difference being: Splendour is and engine builder. Kingdomino isn't, instead it has some spatial puzzle element and set collecting. Which makes Kingdomino more accessible and at least challenging on a wider level of skills involved. 

I enjoyed my 2 plays of it, won both. If we'd played with additional rules (score for castle in the middle, score for completed 5x5 grid) I'd win even more. The skills this game asks for - some spatial planning, plenty of tactical opportunism - come as a second nature to me (autopilot mode). The thingy is amusing, as a puzzle. And probably neat if you want a slightly think-ish game for kids (and parents to play together). 

EDIT - played again (and a similar game Dream Home). The game is really devoid of narrative, but has at least some promise of openness about it and scores can quite vary.

RATING: 9
It is a pretty much perfect, quick game. The spacial puzzle is easy to understand, and the drafting mechanic makes for some potentially agonizing decisions as you get closer to the end of the game. Skipping a tile you want so you can go first on the next set is a sometimes painful, but sometimes necessary strategy. The games take 15 minutes, it can be sort of mean at times, but nothing too terrible. This is definitely one of our favorites.

Kingdomino is really enjoyable, easy to teach and short, making it an excellent filler or family game.

The best mechanic in the game is the tile selection phase because it affects the order you will choose in the next round, giving some strategic decisions.

It can be quite luck based, so if you want to get a bit more serious I recommend playing the variant on which the winner is decided after three games adding the individual scores.

[2017-06-17]
Kíváncsi voltam a Spiel des Jahres jelöltre, mert sokan dicsérték. A játék rendkívül egyszerű, 6 területfajta van a 2 egység méretű dominokon, amiből egy 5x5-ös területet fedünk le a játék során. A dominok értékességük szerint vannak felcsapva, amiből a játékosok választhatnak. Minél értéktelenebbet választunk, annál hamarabb választhatunk a következő körben. A dominók a játék végén úgy értékelődnek, hogy adott egybefüggő ugyanolyan terület nagyságát kell megszorozni a területen levő koronák számával. És ennyi. Rendkívül egyszerű játék, aminek az újrajátszhatósági faktora a kérdés. Szerintem ez a játék még a SdJ kategóriába is túl egyszerű.
Kicsit túlzás rá a 6-os, de a játékelemek is szépek és tartósaknak tűnnek.

[2018-01-01]
Abszolút nem túlzás rá a 6-os, sőt emelek is egyet a ponton, mert bőven van ebben játék. Egyszerű, gyorsan elmondható és minden játékosszámmal jól működik. Abszolút meglepődtem mikor megnéztem, hogy 4-en és 2-en tartják igazán jónak a játékot, pedig szerintem kettesben mivel csak a fél adag dominó játszik, így nagy a szerencse szerepe, hisz nem lehet tudni milyen tájegységek jönnek ki. Valószínűleg 4-en lehet a legjobb, de 3-an semmivel sem rosszabb, mint a többi játékosszámmal, sőt!

Kingdomino is a quick game where, as expected, players take domino-style tiles and place them around their kingdom. It's a very light game, but there are some good decisions in this box, especially if you're playing 2-player. On that subject, the 7x7 variant is really the only way to play with just two. The random exclusion of tiles makes the scoring in a 5x5 a bit too disparate for my tastes. I honestly think this game plays best with four, as players only have one pawn to take tiles with and it makes the experience light and fun. I'm also not a fan of the bonus scoring variants as they either cancel out or inflate the score of the player who won anyway. Overall, this is a beautiful production and a great game for families.

The 2 and 3 player game falters slightly by introducing a bit too much randomness. Randomly removing tiles can make entire terrain types worthless without player knowledge. There are variants to fix this and I highly recommend playing with them.

For 2 players use all tiles and build a 7x7 kingdom.

For 3 players, play as a 4 player game, and remove the tile without a King each round.

Light, short, but just elegant. There's not much to it - just place a tile and take the next one, but the order in which you get to select the next round can be critical for getting the tile that you need, and there's a bit of pressing your luck in choosing with crowns to take and when. A wonderful, short filler and a great family game, as kids can do pretty well even against adults trying their best, and it plays fast.

1 play, 4er

Cute drafting game where you use the tiles you collect to build your own little domain, trying to create contiguous areas of like terrain (including lots of crown icons) to score VP (=crowns x size). You see the tiles available this turn and next. The tile you choose to take this turn also sets your turn order position for next turn -- very elegant! The game plays very quickly and seems like a nice little filler. 

Good choice, SdJ Jury! It's too light for me to seek out additional plays, but I wouldn't mind playing it as a quick little filler!

RATING: 5
I'm almost unfairly writing these comments after having played Queendomino as well.  There is no reason to get this game instead of Queendomino.

In this game players take turns drafting dominoes with different terrain types printed on them and building a kingdom in front of them restricted to a grid of a certain size (7x7 in a 2-player game and 5x5 otherwise I believe).  Terrain of the same type next to each other counts as one landscape and some tiles have crowns printed on them.  At game end you score equal to crowns times the size of the landscape.  That's pretty much it.  There is some simple strategy with bid order and building properly since you can only place a domino if at least one side touches the same terrain type (not counting the starting tile which is wild).  But not much.

I already felt like this game was severely underwhelming but even more so after playing its sequel Queendomino which adds so much more and actually makes it a somewhat interesting game.  Skip this one entirely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very light weight tile laying game. In this game, you are building a kingdom, where the lands of the kingdom are set up like domino tiles. You can only build in a 5x5 grid and turn order is termed by how valuable the previous tile you choose was, both of these constraints allows for some interesting decisions. This game is a bit too light for my taste, but it's short so it does not over stay its welcome.

Would be interested in trying the two player 7x7 variant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not much to get excited about. A good gateway game for the family, I guess. But 2017 SDJ? this only diminishes once again the lustre of the prize. Take the tile that gives you the most point and hope that you can place the next tile. All game depth is discovered on your first game. Winner is luckiest player among those who are not so incapable as to be able to rotate a tile until you find the best position.

This rating is based on my first two plays of the game.  It is a solid game, and one that I would definitely play again.  The game is simple enough, which makes it good to play even with kids, but the only sticking point would be the math at the end.  But this too could be good to keep in the classroom for the way it encourages the gamification of basic math facts (addition and multiplication).

It's cute, and clever, but I prefer it as a two-player game, because with more people, the player who goes last will not have a choice as to which tile they get, so for each round, one person is excluded from the best part of the game, which is deciding which piece they want to add to their kingdom in exchange for when they will get to select next.  As a two-player, with two tiles selected each round, the number of interesting decisions is amplified.  I might try house-ruling with three players and see if game decisions feel less forced.

Players draft terrain-domino tiles into their private 5x5 kingdom, matching on type. Some tiles have crowns in them, and scoring is size of terrain-area multiplied by number of crowns. There are also advanced rules granting points for completing all 5x5 etc.

It's polished and perfect for what it is, which is a super light, super fast multiplayer-solitaire filler. Amongst competent players I expect that luck of the draw will be the deciding factor.

I really feel like it deserves to be rated higher but I would rather have a conversation for 15 minutes than play it. Good for kids.

RATING: 7
[Swan Chinese 17 Edition] {Kingdom; tile-laying; optimal 2/4p} [6 for 3/4p; 7 for 2p] This game is a nice filler.  Player interaction is not strong enough: players have no intention or luxury to block others; most likely, they will concentrate on tiles they need only.  2p Dynasty game is much better - player interaction is much stronger.

This game is children friendly.   It is easy to explain the rules and children have little problem in understanding how the game is played.

The illustration is pedestrian but the King pawns are cute.

Variants:

- Middle Kingdom: I don’t like this variant.  It distorts the goal of the game.  I usually don’t play with this.

+ Harmony: this is nice. It doesn’t add strategic value, but it’s good have a mild bonus for a perfect completion.

++ Mighty Duel: the mega 2p rule is the best to play Kingdomino with 2 players.   Recommended.

+ Dynasty: good to average the luck with 3 rounds.  Play with this if time is not a problem.

We received this as a gift and we were pleasantly surprised.  What seemed to be somewhat elementary  game play offered some clever decision making.  It's not a brain burner, nor is it meant to be, but there are twists that'll make you laugh as you paint yourself into corner.  We've only tried two-player games and had a lot of laughs.  I should probably rate this higher, given how often this quick little game will hit the table.

Kingdomino is a simple game where you draft tiles and attach them to your slowly growing kingdom of tiles (in the manner of domino connections - get it?), then score your kingdoms according to the contents and arrangement. It's definitely a gateway game, something designed for first time players. The tiles are pretty, the rules are clean, and there's little tracking or overhead - VPs are calculated at the end of the game only. There are a few interesting decisions during drafting - sometimes even an empty tile can be worth a lot of points if you can attach them in the right place - but there isn't a lot of strategic oversight or player interaction, just moment to moment decisions. Kingdomino offers a fun and mildly cerebral experience as a non-threatening "my first euro", but there isn't really enough meat for this game to join a gamer's collection.

Played it, it is not as boring as it looked on review as there is some mild strategy involved. That being said, tile-laying games are not my favorite so guess this follows into that category.

tl;dr: run of the mill tile laying game

In this game players bid for 'domino' tiles and place those in their 'kingdom' to score them. But they're not really domino tiles, they're just tiles with 2 landscapes (sometimes twice the same) and you have to have at least one side of those tiles match an already present tile. You score the size of each group of identical landscapes by the amount of crowns on them. Simple and effective. And rather enjoyable. But not very deep and it doesn't really offer different paths to victory.
So fine to play a couple of times, but nothing more than that.

looks like a child's game, artworks like from a children's book
very simple, yes somewhat elegant but also quite flat/shallow

Its strength seems to be the simplicity and shortness.

The drafting mechanism is elegant, but the whole magic is in the numbers on the back.

It's probably best as a "warm up game" for a longer game night!?

A one mechanism, one trick pony, but it's tile laying, it's beautiful, quick and a great gateway game. Queendomino looks more complex and interesting, but maybe Kingdomino serves it's purpose best as it is; a simple gateway game. And there is still a bit of thought and planning involved. How to lay out your kingdom and when to sacrifice turn order for a good return, or take something that is going to benefit an opponent. While luck makes these decisions a bit harder to chew through, it's so light and quick and endearing that it doesn't really matter.

First impressions: not a bad game. It's important to play both offensively and defensively, because if you let someone get too many matching tiles they can just win outright.

Will rate after more plays.

Update: it's just okay. I'll play it but it will never be my first choice. Also I'll only play with four players because with fewer player you don't use all of the tiles, making the game extremely random.

RATING: 7
A quick filler game where you select the tile and place it around your castle in a 5x5 grid. Turn order is determined by the number on the back of the domino tile. 

You score points by adding the number of tile of each type that is connected multiplied by the number of crowns for that type.

Super quick and easy. Can be played with 15 mins.

Kingdomino is a very light filler game that presents some interesting decisions. You're drafting two tiles (domino shaped tiles with 2 spaces on them) per round and placing them into your personal tableau to build a 5 space x 5 space cube. The game lasts six rounds.

Each round there's 2 tiles per player drawn and arranged in number order. On the first turn players alternate putting meeples on tiles. On subsequent turns you start with the lowest tile, and the player with their meeple on the tile moves their meeple to one of the newly revealed tiles and the places the tile they left into their tableau. Then you resolve the next highest tile, etc.

Tiles placed into their tableau must either adjoin an existing tile of the correct type, or start at one of the doors of their keep. At the end of the game, each player will score all their regions according to the number of squares of that terrain type in the region multiplied by all the terrain modifiers in that region. Different terrains have different frequencies of both tiles and modifiers. Whether you can legally place a tile or not might be an issue (you discard tiles you can't legally place). And large areas without any scoring modifiers won't score at all.

There's some interesting placement considerations to make. You might desperately want the highest tile in the column, but that's also the player who will pick last in the next round. Do you take that great tile which hurts you for turn order, or a tile that's not as good, but will give you first pick next round? Also, do you risk taking something you only sort of want trusting that your opponent won't take the thing that does nothing for him, but is crucial for you? Or do you immediately secure the crucial thing and end up with a worthless (possibly unplayable) tile for your second tile? For a fairly quick game this offers a good amount of tough choices.

RATING: 8
[thing=204583][/thing] is a very fast and smart little game: on it, using tiles, the players build their kingdoms. The tiles have two parts (like a domino piece) and at least one of the terrain types must be placed matching another one already in place (the central tile works for any type of terrain). To make areas worth points is necessary to add terrains with crowns, as the points come from the size of the area times the number of crowns on it - thus, a forest area with size 4 and 2 crowns is worth 8 points. At the end of game, if all tiles were used, the player receives 5 points, and if her castle is at the center, 10 extra points. The person with the most points will be the winner!

[thing=204583][/thing] has a lively pace, as choosing the tiles is quick, thus the downtime is quite small. Still the decisions aren't without weight: first due type of terrain and if has or not, crowns to give value to the areas you have; also the tiles are numbered, and bigger numbers go bellow, and the position of it will indicate the order of choosing tiles in the next round - therefore, a person might choose to take a higher tile, even if not so good as one bellow, in order to pick sooner in the following round.

Still, [thing=204583][/thing] is quite light - playing time normally don't go above 20 minutes, even with 4 people. [thing=204583][/thing] is easy to teach, and works well for 2, 3 and 4, which is very nice.

I was expecting good things from [thing=204583][/thing], and it delivered. A fine filler, with relevant decisions and fast pace. It isn't without flaws - in some turns, when you are last to pick, there can be truly no choice: you take the tile that left and the placement of the one you took can be obvious. Still, [thing=204583][/thing] works well for its purpose and gives a neat experience. Definitely recommended.

I can see why Kingdomino won SdJ. It is just the type of game the jury would vote for. It is fun, cute, fast paced and there is some depth to the game play. After a few two player games, the game is still fresh because it is a relatively quick game. It can't possibly disappoint if you haven't spent hours and hours on it. Overall, the game succeeds in drawing players to compete for kingdom building but assembling tiles and properties. The rules are short and not at all complicated which will help draw newbies to the game. 

Overall, the game is harmless fun. It will hang around for a while but I expect it to fall off the grid after a few expansion cycles.

RATING: 9
I didn't understand what all the hype was about until I actually played it for myself.  This may look like a kid's game, but it's so much fun!  It's not a heavy game (can't wait to see Queendomino), but is quick, easy to learn, and easy to set up.  7x7 mode in 2P is how we usually play and it does add a bit of extra challenge, but it's still fun with 5x5 at 4P.  We find that completely filling the square is more difficult than keeping it centered, so perhaps those bonus point allowances should be flipped.  Bonus points for having at least one square (or 1 point?) for every land type would also be an interesting addition.  It may also seem like if someone can get a lot of the mines/swamp they will win, but the grass can be very strong if you can build a huge chunk of it.

Can cause some AP, especially in 2P where you're getting 2 tiles per round, because you're always trying to figure out what you want to place where and how upcoming tiles will fit in.

Wow, pleasantly surprised by this one.  It's simultaneously simpler, and more interesting, than I expected.  A really clever filler that moves on crazy fast with fun decisions. One of the best 4 player fillers I've played.

RATING: 7.6
This was my 'surprise hit of Essen Spiel 2016'. Purchased immediately after playing. This is possibly one where my rating probably does not reflect my enjoyment because I do rate in some relation to quality of design. It is very simple often taking a few turns before a player has that 'lightbulb moment' and realises the decision space available. 8 plays within 1 week, everybody has enjoyed it and has that great satisfaction of building something.

As 20 minute game, 7 rating.

Plays to reach Silver: 32

First impressions were lackluster as it was a 2p game with 5x5 grid. After posing photos on Instagram people notified me of a 7x7 variant (I had not read the rulebook, the other player was) and the 7x7 variant is much better.. Even still, for this kind of a game, Honshu beats this game ten to one.

rank domino tiles with two types of land on them according to number.
Choose tile to add to your kingdom.
If you choose a higher number - you get to select later in the following round. Score points for larger number of identical land tiles connected + special scoring tiles.

This game is more challenging than it appears, yet easy enough to understand and play so that it appeals to a wide audience. However, I found the instructions to be a little unclear for first time play and we had to re-read sections several times to get clarity on what we were supposed to do. (What are you putting in your hands, exactly? Do you place and flip all the pieces at once, or only on turns? etc.) We figured it out, but it would have been nice to not have to put that much brain power into what is ultimately a pretty simple game.

I love the 7x7 variant. There is more depth to it then you think at first. It works for older children, it works for adults, it's going to be a family game classic. I'm looking forward to Queendomino so we can play 7x7 with 4 people. It's so easy to teach complete non-gamers (my mum, my great-aunt etc) and everybody loves it.

This game hits all the right points for me regarding medium-light strategy, tactics, and paying attention to the things your opponent wants. It’s certainly a filler, but it’s a smart and very enjoyable filler that provides a nice puzzle in a short amount of time. We played three games this past week: two standard games (5x5 grids) and one Might Duel game (a special 2P variant where players use 7x7 grids). I enjoyed all of the games we played (even though I lost all 3!), but I think that I may prefer the Mighty Duel variant slightly more. For a bit longer playing time, it provides a bit more strategy and tactics, and a 7x7 kingdom feels even more satisfying than a 5x5 one!

Great quick filler game, lovely chunky domino tiles, and scratches the Carcassonne itch in a 15 min game. Only wish there were more dominoes in the box so that when playing 4-player you could still take out some dominoes randomly (like you do for 2-3 player).

Szép és minőségi filler, mely egy nagyon egyszerű ötlettel szórakoztat negyed órán keresztül. A szuper névadásban minden benne van, hiszen királyságunkat építjük dominó alapokon, de mindezt olyan könnyedén és játékosan, hogy szívesen játszik belőle többet is az ember egyszerre. Családoknak, gyerekeknek elsősorban, de gémereknél is befutó befutó lehet egy-egy nehezebb játék előtt vagy után.

Bought on a whim (mainly because it won the 2017 SdJ), dreading it would be too light for my liking, though.

[b]1st play, 3p:[/b]

Very relaxing (due to its weight and gorgeous artwork) and plays pretty quickly, too. Maybe a bit too simple for a gateway game for adults.

Initial rating: [b]7.25[/b]

----

[b]5+ plays, 3p and 4p:[/b]

I think it's gone up in rating. It still continues to be a short, fun opener. I haven't got to the point where I've memorised the tiles but I now know which tile ranges to look out for. 4p is my favourite player count. We'll have to see how long this high lasts.

Verdict: [b]7.5[/b]

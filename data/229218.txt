This was not a planned purchase but, on Christmas Eve, we realized that we had not purchased a present for my niece and nephew, who were coming over on Christmas day. So we stopped into the store, saw this, knew they liked Catan and thought, “What the heck.” We played it on Christmas Day and loved it so  much that my wife went out the next day and bought us a copy. And that’s a first! I always buy the games and try to talk her into playing. But she got hooked on this one from turn 1. Yes, there are editing problems on components and in the rules, but they are easily overlooked. This variation on Catan is too fun to pass up.

Loved playing it we played it several times in a row... The wall & the wildlings add a new aspect to the game they changes are good.  The playing pieces are really nice it does give you the feel of the Brotherhood of the Watch...

If you can get past the errors and the terrible rules, this is actually a rather good implementation of Catan - as good a version of this as you would expect. It’s a bit on the long side if it goes down to the wire, but I’ve quite enjoyed it, and I think Game of Thrones is pretty laughable.  If they fix all the errors in a second printing I might consider owning it.

I’m running out of adjectives to describe how truly awful FFG’s rules are: breathtaking, mindblowing, jaw-dropping, rank incompetence. These are all that, plus egregious production errors including the wrong victory conditions - you have to get the eratta sheet from FFG’s site.

But, it’s still a design from the Teuber family, and there is a lot of clever stuff here and it’s a pretty clean design. I enjoyed it, although I’m a fan of Catan in almost all it’s incarnations. Even if you’re not a GoT fan (as I am not - I think the books and TV shows are all preposterous) there is fun here for the Catanian.

I was joking with a friend that this is a really bizarre mashup of two fundamentally opposed franchises: Catan, where good neighbors achieve prosperity through friendship and trade in a socialist-capitalist paradise; and Game of Thrones, a libertarian hellscape where trust and therefore trade does not exist and you just want to stab your neighbors, family members, and random passers-by before they do it to you, or alternately, for no reason at all.

This is the most unsatisfactory version of Catan I have played. 

I think the game suffers from a serious design flaw. 

The victory conditions allow all players to lose. If players are doing poorly they have no incentive to work towards helping someone else win.

Minus the misprints and the wall blocking the wildlings from player view, this game is a welcome addition to the Catan series. Components are top notch and gameplay is easy.
 The addition of the wall and wildling breaches make for a fun variant where players actually need to be semi-cooperative in order to keep the wildlings from coming over and haulting resource production. I also like that they created it where people who are new to Catan can play the base game setup without using the GoT variant.

The game is definitely fun to play, adding some interesting twists to the already good Catan mechanics. I am over all quite happy with how they've created this edition.

Be advised however, that the first edition has got quite a few glaring printing "minstakes", lack of roads, cards, misprints on cards etc. I recommend waiting until they've released a new version of this game, in which they've hopefully fixed these problems.

But, if you can overlook these things, I think this is an excellent addition to the Catan Series and I most definitely enjoy playing it.

So I just had the worst experience buying a new game. I spent a lot of money on Game of Thrones Catan and found out that there are missing pieces and misprints int he rule book and game pieces. I contacted the company regarding it. Here is their response.
Current request status: Closed
Note: Thank you for contacting us with your concerns. We are aware of these misprints in the rule book and the components and we apologize for the inconvenience. We have changed this for our future printings of the game and unfortunately do not plan on have the replacements to send out. We will forward your concerns to the appropriate persons involved and if you have any further questions or concerns please feel free to contact us again.
Thanks!

It's far more interesting than Catan, as there are alternative ways of trying to win the game if you fall behind in production early on. The theme is even represented sensibly. although, since this is book licensed, there is no white walkers or dragons to be found.

The game's biggest flaw is the wall, which block parts of the board from view for no good reason if the players don't stand up. This is a situation where cheaper components would make the game better.

Sehr thematisch, tolles Spielmaterial. Kombiniert mit einem der damaligen besten Szenarien: Die chinesische Mauer. Das Spiel gehört in jede Spielesammlung:-) Dadurch, dass alle Spieler gegeneinander & miteinander spielen, ergibt sich ein richtig schönes und spannendes Spielgefühl.

I don't like Catan because of the open trading, swingy dice rolls and race elements. This does not change any of that.

With two scenarios (a training wheel basic Catan game and the full Defend the Wall) and a considerable array of new game pieces, this spin-off offers one less scenario than the Ancient Egypt box, at a price comparable to that box and the Legend of the Sea Robbers combined.
 
The price is hefty, and probably caused by the AGoT license in addition to the limited edition print run.

It plays nicely as a basic Catan game and then you can throw in the GOT themed rules as required. I agree with some of the negative comments about the advanced rules, but it's still fun.

RATING: 5
Disappointing.  An astonishingly amateurish number of mistakes for a very pricey game from a veteran company.  The GOT theme gives this game crossover potential for folks who wouldn't normally buy a serious board game, and it's a real shame because the incompetence with which it was produced is a poor intro to the hobby.  The game is riddled with misprints and is missing components.  The manufacturer is now claiming that the component list is wrong and components are complete, but this contradicts the claim that the box includes basic Catan as well, since included components are short of those needed for basic Catan.  

As far as gameplay, it was okay, suffering from Catan's dice dependence.  It incorporates elements of Star Trek Catan in the form of hero cards, and Cities and Knights in some of the development cards and hero abilities.  The wall blocking the wildling portion of the board from player view and some lack of clarity in announcing die rolls ("I rolled 7 and 4" "which is which? "7 for us and 4 for wildlings") was tiresome.  Instead of a numberic die, one with symbols matching the camps would work better.  In the one game we played so far, the wildlings were much ado about nothing, I won in the same turn as the first of them reached the wall.  

In all, it's an okay game with decent quality pieces but sadly poor production values as far as editing and content control.  I don`t see it getting a lot of play.

I had a fun time with this game, would play again. A few comments:

-The wildling rules were very poorly explained and illustrated for what was ultimately a pretty simple thing (in fact the rulebooks were terrible, inconsistent explanations across the two books)
-Misprints/typos on stuff. Comeon man!
-Hero cards were awesome. By far the best addition to the game. Would love to see other games that had this kind of 'hero swapping' mechanic.

will rekindle my love for Catan, I am sure. Really liked my play and very excited for the release. Pretty thematic too and a lot of cool new features they added to the general Catan game with different scoring for members on the wall. Very cool.

The game play is not that bad, has interesting mechanics (heroes). But the game in it's first edition its horrible. The manual y badly written, the game comes with misprints, missing pices, and mechanics that feel not very well tested.

It was the worst experience I had buying a new game. Fantasy Flight really messed up with the first edition. Please don’t support them by buying this piece of crap until they really fix it or take responsibility for their mistakes.

A nice variant on Catan.  The production value (printing mistakes aside) is excellent and watching your Nights Watchmen man the wall is cool.  However, in the end it is just Catan and is good for a few plays per year.  Still, it will hang out in my collection.

Just got it and played it for Thanksgiving Holiday.  The Keeps (Cities) are well sculpted.  The other components are good.  It feels like a repeat of the Great Wall, one of the earlier Catan Expansions, where the Mongolian barbarians overrun the Chinese civilization.  Would have liked to have a Catan based game on the rest of the Continent.  Not as good as Catan: Nuremburg, Cities & Knights, or Explorers & Pirates; but still worth paying the price for these components.  
Wonder if a 5-6 player game could add Dragons, White walkers, Mammoths, and another middle section for d12 rolls of 9-12.

It was interesting adding a sense of impending doom to Catan.  Those Wildlings are going to make it over the wall and mess with your stuff eventually.  Trying to combat that... or take advantage of it to win the game on something other than points... is a nice twist, but I know in my first game it took me too far away from building my resource engine and my overall game suffered for it.  Learning to balance growth and defense is no doubt an interesting part of this game, but it suffers from enough Catan flaws (heavily dice dependent... bad trading can break the game...)  that I'd generally prefer to play some other middleweight Euros in its place.

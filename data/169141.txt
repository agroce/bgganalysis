Comments after first short solo play.
Superb game, really engaging and thematic. Rules are well written and easy to follow & understand with plenty of examples.
So many cards in each deck will keep replayability high.

Fantastic game, made with passion.  The game can be pretty cut throat, so make you play with people that can handle it :).

This is the real deal people! . 13 years of burning the midnight oil to put together this immersive masterpiece...and boy does it show . It's been a long time since a game leaves me still thinking about it days later. The stories you will encounter are phenomely well done. Base game + Kickstarter + promos = 760 cards! . Replayability appears endless..
Great theme , truly immersive and engaging experience make for a unique and very different board game .

This game takes components of board, dice, card, and roleplay gaming and throws it all together. Not hard to learn, can play over and over. I'll be playing this one for life!

I heard about 'Fallen Land' while I was on my way to the February Gaming Convention that was held February/March, in Iowa City, and I was then very much in anticipation for getting into a game that would just 'fit my elements' as roughing-it is my style (and what better than a game that entails all the grit a person would need to survive in an environment that many people so much enjoy watching on movies about zombies or shit breaking-out-wild in a world dictated by ordered-chaos & anarchy?)

I was into the game the second I sat down, and knew that though the immense game would take some time in learning and understanding the concept of gameplay, I was beforehand aware that the education would be entertaining in itself as I've said before, "anticipation". Besides, getting into a new game while knowing there is still more to come and discover does indeed allow for an enriching gaming-experience.

I enjoyed the equipping; I liked checking out my characters and teaming them up; deciding who would die or who would live in imagined scenarios occupied my mind while preparing for nasty encounters.... Once gameplay ensued, I played neutral-good neighbor until someone decided to fuck with me, where thankfully, I had an 'armageddon' of cards that with two rounds of play, I laid it out onto my opponent deeper than 'dante in hell' and showed him his mistake (and bam! I was beaming, giddy, happy, triumphant, and just all-out pleased with the impeccable timing of the game that gave me the sense of divine intervention in having one heaven-of-a-gaming experience (as though it was ordained (lol))).

All in all, I want this game for my own, where on a quiet, slow day, I can take the time to by myself sit and know this game through and out, where to one day again sit down with some friends and then show them who's boss. 'Fallen Land' is a world I enjoyed submersing myself into, and would gladly do it again, and again, and again...

HUGE game in a relatively small box! - love ALL the flavor text. 
More role playing than you can imagine - ability to negotiate almost anything :-p with other players.
Massive replayablility thanks to a massive amount of cards - obviously a real labour of love by the creators, there is just so much theme and text and passion for the concept evident in every part of the game.
Rules are streamlined and the skills/combat dice checks very easy to apply - just gotta remember ALL the special abilities etc.
Can't believe this didn't do as well as the CMON and AR games - frankly it is BETTER than most of them - just needed the coverage/name/hype that it deserved.
Still it is around fro purchase - so do yourself a favour and just GET THIS GAME!

This is an immersive experience. It would be a 10 except that the length and ability to get to the table may be an issue as you will want to set aside about 4 hours to fully appreciate the game with 4 players. When you get it to the table it is a 10.

Fallen Land is not a game for everyone.  Casual gamers and those who like playing against the game but not each other beware of an inappropriately tailored experience t your playstyle.

That said, this game is a loveletter to the hardcore boardgaming community.  Filled with infinite replayability and variety enough to keep even the most cynical caustic bastards amongst us entertained, and using the rich nougaty evil that dwells within us all towards our fellow man as it's primary balance mechanic...Fallen Land delivers an experience unlike any other board game I've ever played.

Outstanding!  I REALLY love this game.  Been playing since it came out.  My game group has really been loving it too, but players must read the rule book beforehand.  That's no big deal, as it's well written, with great examples.  Can't wait to see what comes next for Fallen Dominion Studios!

A huge game by any measure. Not for the faint of heart, or the half-committed. Shelve the devices, switch off the screens, and spend an evening in a brutal survival story of your own.

RATING: 9.5
With all aspects of life after civilization's fall, Fallen Land gives as much on a strategic level as it does with it's tight rpg rules. Brilliant and brutal (and often humorous) storylines build tales worth the re-telling. Few games will leave you as satisfied with the time spent playing it as will Fallen Land.

Control a party exploring the wastelands, and upgrade your homebase. The theme is brilliant and the mechanics are my favorite with RPG lite feel and storytelling mechanics. Its hard not to LOVE This game! The art is a little rough and the rules are more complex side and occasionally resolving a check can get a little unwieldy.... otherwise perfect post apoc game!

Huge! Many items to keep track of. Uses big table space. Game is hard with death, good apoc sim. Bowers loves this game. Expansion "Journey into Darkness" supports solo(maybe possible with just base?). KS $63+10. KS w/ exp was $81+10. Now dev website has base for $85+ship. Get @$50 or lower cuz it maybe like PACG boring dice rolls?

Love this game!  Incredibly original and will NEVER play the same game twice.  This game is a must own for all serious gamers and sets a high bar for the post-apocalyptic genre.  Can't wait to see what comes next for Fallen Dominion Studios!

My game group has had a great time with this too.  The stories are amazing and will have you talking about the game long after it is over.

Step into a living, breathing post-apocalyptic world where anything and everything could possibly happen. Build up your town, send out your exploration parties, explore the wastes for spoils including fuel, weapons, and food. This is a game that does not need to be overlooked! This is already going into my top 10 games of all time! And I think it will move up on that list as more plays happen.

I was so happy to see it back at GenCon 2017 that I demo'd it again! I'm glad I did as this time I was able to fully note and enjoy the care, detail, and overall quality that has been put into it. Can hardly wait to have it in my hands and introduce it to my gaming friends!

I really liked the idea behind Fallen Land, but I found the execution to be a bit cumbersome. The game feels like it has been made complicated for no reason, other than the designers couldn't stand the idea of getting rid of anything!

It seems like every character and a lot of equipment have specific perks, such free successes and other cool skills. These perks would be a big help, if it were easier to keep track of everything. With only a bit more than the starting equipment, I had about 20 different perks to track, between the faction perks, the town technologies, the different character perks as well as equipment and vehicle perks.

I thought the gameplay was good, and allowed for a lot of different strategies, but overall I just found the game to rely on fidgeting with the rules too much for me to really enjoy.

Loved the game.  Newly added to my list of favorites.  Great stories and unlimited replay ability. Played at Gen Con 2017 and ordered a copy right away.  My game group has been loving it too.  Something here for everyone.

Played at a friends house.  3 players. 1 player had studied and played a couple of times at cons, and did a solo run at home before inviting us, so our learning curve was mitigated a bit.

Pro: Very text heavy, which I liked; Having several characters each with different stats and abilities, and each one having several items in their possession to influence skill checks provided a lot of customization of your party - including various vehicle options with upgrades to those, as well - started with the horses and stuck with them to get the feel as best I could; barter between players - real horse trading; the chance to help players and the chance to stick it to players - having both options was quite nice.  Stories on the various cards were well written and interesting - not just filler.

Con: Very text heavy, One of our players wasn't so keen - didn't enjoy reading out loud in front of others; Time consuming; If you want to really optimize your party, you will spend a lot of time studying your characters, and fine tuning what each one is capable of by carefully selecting the stuff they are carrying..listed this as a con because it can slow the game down and be annoying to others if you are a perfectionist and the other players are not (I am, but forced myself to move it along)

You should play this on a large table.  Spreading out your cards so you can keep the many many many important aspects of each card fresh in short term memory will be a big help.

Overall, enjoyed it quite well and would definitely play it again.  Personally, I liked this one much more than Twilight Imperium (which I have also only played once so far).

Currently the best post apocalyptic board game out there. I got it as a kickstarter, and am thrilled with it. This game should be getting a lot more attention than it is so far. In the post-apolcalyptic genre, I've played Waste Knights and Posthuman, and find Fallen Land to be superior to both of those. Really enjoy managing my team of adventurers, love the missions and quick resolution of skill/combat situations. Excellent we, somriting for the story cards too - entertaining, rough and ready, excellent themetimes stories can be mature rated. Giving this game 10 stars!!!

A fantastically expansive game that will result in no two games ever being the same.  With a seemingly endless supply of cards  and the art harkening back to the old heavy metal and biker art of the 70s, Fallen Land really is a can't-miss game.  A mix of board game, and RPG, it comes across as a Mad Max simulator, in all the best ways.

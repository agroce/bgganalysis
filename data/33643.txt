Wonderful children's game, my son adores this one.  The game doesn't require reading to play, so it works with the very young crowd.  The game is very easy though when played as the rules suggest with young kids where inventory limits on the cat are ignored.

Gave as a gift to Skelton Clan, but we played over the 2017 holidays, was fun. Might get another copy. Packaging was a bit excessive,  lots of air room, individaul compartments for just a few parts makes it a big box for a relatively small game. Nice though.

A fantastic game for kids and families: a very nifty electronic box acts as games master in a magical fairytale castle. The core game is pretty basic - you do what the box tells you and try to remember a few clues - however my 6-year-old son (ok, me too...) is completely enchanted by the world of evil wizards, fairies, ghosts and traitorous thieves it conjures up.

Cute voice box gimmick. But any board game that requires batteries to play automatically loses some points with me. It is a well designed mystery game. It teaches, in a fun way, a deductive logic component to younger players. I like that. But the hint system is too fiddly. If you mess up, you kind of have to start all over again.

Fun enough (7).  

(-1) Had some trouble when the wrong buttons were pushed, then attempting to determine whether the talking-box was back in sync with the game board.  Detracted from the experience, made the structure of the game seem very fragile, and thus made it harder for me to relax and enjoy the "gaming experience."  

Not sure I wouldn't rather play a less interesting game with my nephews, just in case of a game-breaking error.  Analog games, more so than electronic games, can be more easily corrected, rather than having the game potentially come to a screeching halt.

RATING: 4
(KIDS) Reiner mixes a little electronics with a board game.  After three plays, I can see this could get repetitive for me.  The electronic device has been implemented in a very intelligent way that compliments the game.  The voices are a bit lame for me, but my kids do enjoy the ghost voice.  Overall, this is a good game for younger gamers (3 to 5) and well implemented.

RATING: 7
What a delightful little game. It works fine as a very light co-op, and the speaking treasure chest and marvellous components (including a completely superfluous magic ring) provides sufficient novelty to keep children occupied.

Even on the hardest setting, there isn't really anything for adults here. But the presentation and gameplay together makes this a top-tier family game. I say family game because it won't be appealing to older kids, and younger kids will need some help with it, so it's best as a game played with parents and their children.

Ranked as a family game.

Cooperative game with a  electronic voice  box.  The kids really, really like it.  It teaches strategy and decision making with limited resources.  You are all working to find the thief before time runs out.  There are three levels of difficulty.

We have never lost, so not sure if there is a real negative consequence, but we still love it.  

We often find ourselves quoting little stupid parts from that woman.

This is a great game for families with multiple children of different ages. All players are one team and play against the clock, which eliminates frustration of the younger kids when the older ones are smarter or better. Here the players have to find solutions together and split up tasks to solve a problem on time, which gives everyone a chance to contribute the final piece of evidence. An electronic box with a push button also eliminates the need to read for 4 or 5 year olds. 3 different levels of difficulty keep it challenging even for much older kids.

(App). Great family game for kids. Search for food to feed the animals to get clues which identify thief through process of elimination. Like Clue for kids. The cooperative nature teaches social skills, sorely needed at that age. So I'd say it's perfect for 6 year olds.  The family experience is higher than you'd think from the game itself--which is the point. Hence the 9.

This game is very fun to play with my children. Picked it up for a themed birthday party. After winning together several times on the Easy and Medium settings, I decided to try the Hard setting. I was hoping for more of a challenge, but actually finished with my best times using that setting. A little disappointed that Hard wasn't exceptionally hard.

The components and quality of this game are top notch.

They definitely enjoyed it, though my oldest was a little scared of it and the younger ones needed some help with the deduction.

Rated as a kids game, I give this a solid "9".  Our 6-yr and 8-yr old had a good time with it.  The cooperative element, added along with deduction in a race against time is married very well in a way that makes it fun for the adult playing along.  I see many plays in the future with this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Even our son strongly prefers Outfoxed to this game but even though the deduction is far more straightforward in Whoowasit? its made more complex by the need to remember things.  I do find, like most adults, that I don't really care for memory elements in "grown-up games" and as such we also prefer something like Outfoxed from an adult perspective if we are going to play a children's game.  However Whoowasit? is unique enough to warrant also having it in our collection still.  The already mentioned memory element combined with the narrative and audible clues given by the box.  The box itself we immediately replaced with the iOS App which is well worth it.  You can play the game on the App without the physical game yes but it also has a mode where it is just a replacement for the box in your physical game and its SOO much easier to understand.  Our son seems to get into the theme of this one a bit and the board and other art is nicely done to help convey this along with the Ghost character itself.  He also gets a kick out of the secret doors to the dungeon, tower and other such places in the game.

Spectacular! A deductive game for kids and adults with amazing replay ability! I absolutely agree with this winning the Kinderspiel de Jahres. It is a true gem. We find it is just as fun to play and an outstanding game of deduction along the lines of say Clue the Great Museum Caper (that old classic). It is easier to play than the Clue game and perfect for young kids. But I never mind a game of this. The game is unique and different every single time. 

There must be one heck of a computer chip in the treasure box that keeps this game so varied...I really didn't think it was possible. For example, upon playing our 10th game on hard difficulty. The crow stole the cherries...I was astounded...I thought the crow only stole the carrot. The animals always want something different to eat, always random. The thief is always someone different...amazing!

The components are above and beyond what you would expect. The treasure chest that you use throughout the game is a true board game work of art. Every component has a perfect little place in the box. They really thought of everything.

Nice and atmospheric coop, but only to be played with children. I only played the iPad version, but I guess the differences with the board game are only administrative. This is a very fine example of electronics in a board game, as it's hard to imagine how certain (random?) events could be modeled using more traditional methods like cards and dice. It would certainly be a lot more fiddly.

Good co-op kids' game. I wasn't so impressed after our first play (on easy mode), as it seemed like the rules were incomplete. With further plays, though, it becomes clear what to do. 

With three levels of difficulty, there's some incentive to continue playing, and we've quickly worked our way up to the medium or hard level. I'd even rate the game higher, but I think this game will be best if not played too frequently. Although there is randomization with every game, it starts to feel the same if played too often.

There's some benefit to the game as well, as it promotes good listening skills, memory, and (light) logical and strategic thinking. The co-op aspect also requires players to work together.

Played with a 5-yo and 8-yo, both of whom now request the game frequently.

As for childern's game, this is very nice one. Must try on higher difficulty to say something more.

More like a toy than a board game.  Minimal decision with nice bits.  Sounds to be a good children game.  If an English edition is released, I would buy it.

Everyone else seemed to enjoy this, but I couldn't find the fun in it. Roll & move - search or talk. Those are all of your options. The voice box works, but has some genuinely terrible voice acting going on and really could have been more user friendly.

Just not really fun though we did manage to very nearly lose, playing with three adults (and no kids).

The rating is a combination of kid's enjoyment and my enjoyment playing it with kids.

This is a one-trick pony, but it's a great trick. As others have said before, even after a lot of play I am still surprised by some of the ghost's clues. There is replayability here. Plenty for kids anyway.

One thing to be aware of is that the recorded ghost voice can actually be scary to younger or more sensitive kids. Don't assume it is appropriate for all ages.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

Better than kids games like Outfoxed and Sleeping Queens, but nowhere near as good as Camel Up or Party Sushi Go.

Children's game. Uses electronical box as a plot device. It randomizes the setup, and operates as game clock. Sound quality is bad.

My son (6) absolutely loves this game. He can play it alone or with friends, when the game is really communicative. Occasionally I play with him and it's also good fun. 
The only problem is that there is no "very hard" option to make the game more competitive. Now, my son manages to win basically all the time. This does not keep him from playing the game daily (!), trying to beat his own records (and hoping that the priest is the traitor; boy did I educate my boy well).

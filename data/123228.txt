I guess it's hilarious when people know down nearly the whole tower and get -50 points or so. And it's quick. Otherwise... it's more or less like Jenga I suppose.

Gemstone or Lumberjack, Gemstone or Lumberjack?!

That's the debate I went through before jumping on Mayday Games' "limited quantity" of Bling Bling Gemstone from their online store. I also pre-ordered Click Clack Lumberjack redesign (missed the kickstarter!), since it adds in grubs and had an even better package design, but now I'm wondering if I should cancel that, because Gemstone is a blast. 

It's a great warm-up game, and it was so popular that one of my least gaming-inclined gaming buddies requested it be brought out again at the end of a long game night for a couple more rounds. When I told my buddies (all guys) about Lumberjack and showed them some pictures, they scoffed. Who wants to knock boring bark off a tree (which I still don't even understand the concept of-- what kind of lumberjack only takes bark?). They were much more excited by the pretty, clear "gems" (take that, macho gamers!) which makes me laugh and also makes more sense conceptually. You chisel minerals and gems out of rock; the gameplay concept makes much more sense than knocking bark off a tree trunk.

While it takes a little longer to put together than Jenga (slotting the gems just-right into the core is trickier than you'd think), everyone had a great time trying far-too-weak and then far-too-strong whacks against the pillar of gems. The -10 points for knocking out a core piece seems overly penalizing, but it works out well in the final scoring. If you knock too many out, though, you might get a little dispirited about playing well. Fortunately, there are a bunch of game variations suggested in the manual that I'm looking forward to trying.

The game looks silly and childish, but I don't think anyone could not have fun with Bling Bling Gemstone-- board gamer elite to casual players of all ages. Highly recommended!

Positives
- Fantastic component design, particularly the pickax and the transparent gem pieces
- Very quick to teach and play
- Lots of variants possible thanks to the different gem colors

Negatives
- Physical setup is a little tricky and more challenging than expected, but gets better with practice

A simple Jenga style game where on a players turn they get two swings(must make contact) to knock colored gems off a mine vein. Points value's are three for red, two for pink, one for clear and negative ten for a block of the vein. Winner is the player with the most points once all gems are gone.

The game itself is alright, but seemed a bit broken at first. Once you are down to a few gems and a lot of bad veins you just tap the tower and pass your turn until someone breaks and decides to take a chance. Insert a video the designer made teaching the game and including an alternate rule; Each player must take a gem. If they fail on their two swings to get a gem them must add a gem from their pile to underneath the main vein. First person to knock down a new gem gets all the gems underneath. Really that rule is a must. 

Like most dexterity games it can get old quick. Another downside is that if someone gets down big in the game, and is extremely selfish, they can just knock down the rest of the tower to end the game, even if other people are in a heated race. You'd think that wouldn't happen but I know first hand the horror.

All in all, the game is fun, sets up and plays moderately quickly, has little rules explanation, can play to a younger audience, and does catch eyes at game nights. Don't question yourself if you are thinking of buying it. If you are deciding between this and Tok Tok Woodman/Click Clack Lumberjack then you should go this for this one. The ax is neater in those games, but the center pieces slide like they are waxed in this one as opposed to needing force in your swings in the other.

*Also does not work as greatly when combined with Tok Tok Woodman/Click Clack Lumberjack to makes a super huge tower. The tower is just too tall and with the not budging plastic wood centers it's easy to over tap and take negative a billion in one swing. It's also twice the setup time.

Morbid curiosity brought me to play Bling Bling Gemstone, and I think that's why most people will ever put their hands on it.  It's attractive on the table and looks like a lot of fun, but... it isn't.

Of course, this is simply criticism on the game as a game.  As an activity with children, it does its job admirably and they definitely love when the tower falls.

This game was alot of fun.  Kinda like jenja except you use either a hammer or pickaxe to knock the pieces side to side so that the gems will fall off of the center pieces.  You want the gems and not the center pieces as the center parts are major negative points. An easy game to play with young kids.

It's fine? It does what it sets out to do, but it always seems like it's more tedious to set back up than what you get from playing it. And with kids, it just degenerates quickly.

Light dexterity game. The game takes just as long to set up as it does to play. Players take turns wacking away, with a plastic pickaxe, at ore veins that have different colored gems on them. For every one you knock over you get -10 pts. For every red 3 pts, pink 2 pts, and white 1 pt. Highest point total wins after all of the gems are gone. Quick and simple. Aside from laughing at yourself, there just is not that much fun here.

Excellent dexterity game. A tall tree-like structure sits in the center of the table. Each player takes a large plastic pickaxe or uses the golden axe to chop pieces of gems off from the tree without knocking off the central bark of the tree. We own more than one copy so as to play games with a very very tall gem tree. The game takes on a whole new intensity and I think it's better with 2, 3 or even 4 tall. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Excellent dexterity game. In this game you use a pickaxe or golden axe to tap the gems off the tree. The nice thing is each colored gem provides differing amounts of points (red - 3pts, pink - 2pts and clear - 1pt) with the center part of the tree counting as negative 10 points per stump you knock down.

The base game itself is ok, but if you add 1, 2 or 3 expansions on top of the base...this game becomes a real challenge. I think the sweet spot is 3 tall (base and 2 expansions).

(5+ plays)  A fun little party game along the lines of Jenga, but quite a bit harder.  The trick to setting it up that we figured out is to attach all of the gems to the bases spread out on the table, then pick up the sets to build the tower.  It's a pretty game, and the kids like it, but we're usually scoring who wins by the least negative number.  If it wasn't for the kids, I'd get rid of this one.

Apparently this is just a fancier version of Toc Toc Woodman, which I'd never played before either. It's a dexterity game where you're trying to shift the tree trunk over enough for some of the bark to fall off, but not far enough that the tree trunk falls off. Except in this version it's mining gems off a tree trunk... or something.

I guess this is about as fun as Jenga... if you want to use the word fun. It's fine enough. I'd play it if someone wanted to... but it's not something I'd seek out.

RATING: 6
[thing=123228][/thing] reimplements [thing=39206][/thing]. It is a light dexterity game in which players use a toy axe to hit a pillar - the purpose is to show control: this is a challenge for the lumberjacks - any of them can hit a pillar and put it down. But only the best of them can take out the gem of a pillar without ever hitting its core! 

Therefore, you will hit the pillar in order to make the gem pieces fall, but the core stay in the pillar. Of course the core is divided into pieces, so they dance around, making the balance of the whole thing more and more unyielding.

In his turn, the player have two hits to give. Even the slightest touch will count as a hit. For every red gem the player will gain 3 points, for every pink gem 2 points and for every transparent gem 1 point. If the player makes a core fall, each will give minus 10 points for the player.

The game ends when all the gems have fallen from the pillar. The player with the most points, wins!

The production value for [thing=123228][/thing] is high: the pieces are sturdy enough to withstand a lot of "punishment" - most of the times the gem pieces (and even the core pieces) would fall of the table, but they resisted this fine. No worries here (except losing the pieces, of course).

A whole play can last anytime from 5 minutes to around 15, it all depends on how careful people are in hitting the pillar.

[thing=123228][/thing] is a fine dexterity game, much in the vein of [thing=2452][/thing], but with a little less control (the use of the toy axe seemed to throw people a little more off the mark). I do like [thing=2452][/thing] better, however, since I'm not a fan of the scoring in [thing=123228][/thing] - it take a lot of the emotion and, also, it can be "gamed". I explain: when the score is 6 to -8, you know that you already probably lost - a comeback if unsual (more often the player ahead will hit too hard and make one or more cores to fall). Also, I seem people that basically took himself off the game when winning with a fine margin - they would hit the pillar only for show (really softly) and would only try to get more gems if one or more of them were in an easy position to be taken. Sure, maybe this last one only happen when people are vying more for the win than for the fun of the thing, but still can happen. In [thing=2452][/thing] you will always have to take out one of the pieces - so the challenge is always there.

In the end, I liked [thing=123228][/thing] more than [thing=39206][/thing], as [thing=123228][/thing] doesn't have the worm markers, which make the game gains in luck value, and the three types of gems up the challenge and the dispute, which is very good addition to the game.

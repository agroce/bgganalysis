Small and compact 2 player version of Ascension.
Really good for travel and aslo for solitaire play.
Very similar to tha base game (but only cards for 2 players).
The manual is also the play board (which is not too bad to start with).
Good version to start with if the Ascension is not known.
However I have also most of the full versions.

One of the best bang for your buck values I've ever seen in this hobby. Ascension is a good, fun deck building game, and while it's not on the same level as Dominion, there is no reason you can't enjoy both. Some people even prefer Ascension. Regardless, for $10.00 MSRP this game is a MUST OWN. If you don't fall in love with it, you will still be quite happy with how much you get out of it. If you do love it, you have the option for bigger full sets to expand the game.

Ascension is a FANTASTIC deck builder, though this isn't a set I would bother to get. Perhaps good for travel, since it cuts the number of cards down to just those needed for two players to play, but this also removes some of the variety you'd get with one of the proper boxed sets, and the 'apprentice edition' (being comprised of cards from various other sets) can't really be mixed with them. I'd highly recommend the game for sure, but I'd only get this set specifically for travel, or unless you are just really, really unsure if you'd like the game or not. Otherwise, you're just better off starting with the bigger boxes.

This is one of the best values in hobby gaming. If you even think you might like ascension and even if you don't it is worth the $10 to pick it up. My wife's favorite game in our collection. it is quick to set up and easy to learn and teach. a deck builder with some randomness thrown in. always fun and crazy replay ability for a starter edition. It got us hooked on ascension and as soon as this little gem loses its luster we will be buying a big box version to beef it up. Fantastic value and fantastic game.

Good, super affordable rehash of the game. Contains cards from the first four sets, some with greatly improved artwork (spike vixen, lifebound initiate, and a few others). I have no problems with the revised card faces, and freely mix them with cards in my collection and cube. 

Recommended for the extremely cost-conscious. If budget is not a concern though, I'd recommend people start with Storm of Souls.

I love deckbuilders, but based on this edition of the game, I think I like Star Realms better. Unfortunately, my group prefers this to Star Realms, so I am outvoted. I don't know if this problem is specific to this version of the game, but it seems that in probably 95% of the games I've played in this two-player set, whoever had first turn won. I will give the full base game a try and see if I find that a little more interesting.

This is a great 2 player game of Ascension, just as fun as the full base set.  The only drawback is that it's limited to two players.  It also has cheaper cardboard honor tokens rather than the fancy plastic ones in the regular set.

One thing that is actually better than the base sets is that each type of card (starting hand, mystic/heavy, and center cards) have different colored boarders for easy sorting.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I had the base game plus all the expansions & sold them.  There were so many hundreds of cards that unless a person had played numerous times to know the cards, the game bogged down with reading text.  I found myself rushing through buys just to keep the game moving along.  

This version is short--1 deck of cards, only two players, so even if you need to linger over buys the game moves right along.  And with so few cards, it is easy to know what a card does & how it interacts when it appears.  I like this small version--it's a keeper.

I also realize, the base game can be a two player game as well.  If you want to know what Ascension is all about, play this small card pack first.

Just falls flat for me, especially at solo play.  The cards in Star Realms make me feel like my choices matter more and have much stronger synergies in practice so I prefer it for a small inexpensive 2 player deck builder or solo experience.  (Although some people argue they are too powerful and make Star Realms swingy.)

iOS: I find it hard to see the cards and follow what is going on, and did not enjoy playing.  Maybe a better option if you know the game well.

Small box, small price tag, good game! There has been an upgrade in art and a downgrade in the component quality but that makes this box an excellent gateway into a fun deckbuilding game.

RATING: 9
A good selection of cards, and I don't really want to play Ascension with more than two people anyway. But Ascension thrives on variety, so I don't know. Maybe the smaller deck forces more of a mixed strategy because you aren't going to get multiple bombs from the same faction? I would play this more to find out, just not expecting too much.

A very nice intro to the world of Dominion-like card games. The art is a little less SABEE with some old cards having received new art. The honor counters are much nicer than the little plastic ones you get in the other Ascension games. You only get 60+ or so deck cards (not counting the mystic, heavy infantry, apprentice and militia) but it is a starter set. A brilliant little box for $10 retail. This is a definite 2 player game filler (since the deck is smaller than the big Ascension release) and it plays quicker too. Not for the Ascension fan, but perfect IMO for those who want to try the mechanic without spending $40.

We have three deck building games: Dominion, Star realms, and Ascension.  Ascension is about 80% Star Realms and 20% Dominion with very little new.  But I think it is probably our favorite of the three, and that is saying something because we love all three.  Going to buy some expansions.

Singular function cards(Apprentice/Mystic & Militia/Heavy Infantry) combined with the randomly generated center row create too many turns where your strategy did not match up with probabilities, and can lead to a snowball problem.

I know some hardcore Ascension fans that already own the game will stick their nose up at this, but I think this 2 player version of the game is fantastic. The updated art on these cards is superior to the original base game, and everything you need to play this game is right here in the box. It's a portable, attractive and very cost effective version of this amazing deck building game. There is so much game in this box for very low (under $10) price.

Solitaire possible with rules variant from main game:

Solitaire

* Set aside 50 Honor tokens

* Lay out the Center Row as normal, but whenever a card leaves the Center Row, the replacement card always enters on the left-hand side and the remaining cards slide over to the right.

* You take the first turn of the game. At the end of each of your turns, Nemesis is considered to acquire or defeat the two cards furthest to the right in the Center Row.

* All cards acquired by Nemesis are set aside and only used to determine its Honor total at the end of the game.

* Any Monsters defeated go to the Void, and Nemesis receives any Honor from their reward. All other effects are ignored.

* Continue playing this way until the last Honor token is gone, then compare your score to the total Honor earned by Nemesis. If you have more Honor, you win!

Okay, but not great.  The small assortment of cards becomes stale pretty quickly although the gameplay is 99% identical to that of the larger sets.

I'd rate this a 7 just for the game itself. It's a streamlined, more basic set of Ascension cards designed to introduce 2 players to the game.

Easily the cheapest deck-builder your can buy.  But if you play regularly against the same opponent, you'll find yourself losing interest pretty quickly.  Naturally, they'd like you to expand to one of the full versions.

The art is much improved and apart from the fancy board and tokens that come with the larger sets, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't just buy two of these instead of a larger edition. Even buying 2, it would be less than 1/2 the price.

The perfect introductory set.  The components are all designed to have a low price point, yeah the box sucks and the tokens are cardboard...who cares?  It's a $10 introduction to ascension and a good game in its own right.  More publishers should take note.  May lack staying power but EASILY expanded.

[EDIT] I played this to death with a buddy of mine, it was a great value for the number of plays we got from it.  I gave this to my brother to play with his wife.

This is a great deal to get ascension. I had played the ios version a lot and this was a steal at the $8 I got it for. It feels like the full game. If you are interested in trying ascension, this is a great way to do so. I don't feel like this is just a taste of the game, it gives the full experience at 1/4 the normal cost.

Its no magic, or dominion for that matter. Seems less strategic and more tactical in nature. But fun and somewhat addictive.

Serves as an excellent 2-player intro to Ascension, and can satisfy players who like it but have no wish to own all the rest.

I feel that it has limited replayability as a standalone, but I could be wrong.

This is total commercial crap. There is absolutely no need for this 'introductionary edition'. If you wanna learn the game, there is no better way then with simply the first game 'Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer';

The artwork on this one is very ugly, they raped there own game!

RATING: 5
Not bad, but not great. Similar to Star Realm and Dominion (so if you like one of them and want something slightly different, at least theme-wise, maybe give this a go). Really easy to learn, which is nice for new and casual players. A bit random with all the cards and the shuffling. Pasted on theme

It's an ok intro set. However, my wife and I have played a TON of Ascension and eventually I traded it all away. I got this set for her birthday because she missed it. I was pretty disappointed with the 60 honor token count, as the game ends just as your deck is getting going. We both agreed we need to buy at least Rise of Vigil again and keep it this time because Ascension is too good a game to not have at least one copy in the house.

Pretty standard deck building game. I picked it up for $1 on clearance and think it would have been worth at least $2. Really, this doesn't seem to bring anything new to the table from any other deck builder I've played other than a slight variation on the theme. First player to X victory points wins the game.

You have the standard starting decks, standard economy cards and combat cards, standard "special" abilities on cards, and standard types of factions. The only thing really different from most deck builders I've played is that you're attacking generic monsters that show up in the buy row, which really just means that combat cards are the same as economy cards using a different currency.

OK deck building game. I prefer Star Realms or Dominion for more than 2 players.

The box was not great. It was not a tuck box so to open it tore up. I have replaced the box with a hard plastic box with a covering lid. I can't find a picture, but you put the cards inside the box and the lid slides down over the top all the way to the bottom. I can send pictures upon request.

RATING: 8
Although the bigger boxed version has better art and accommodates more players, Apprentice Edition gets all the core elements of Ascension in there - and Ascension is still the best deck builder out there, for my money. I seem to be one of the few people who favour indirect confrontation in deck builders.

Plays like a basic deck builder (think Dominion) but I prefer this game because of the 6 cards in the middle that you have the opportunity to either fight for points or buy for their action. Every card in the main deck is different so it lends itself to a lot of unique player play (not every player is going to play the same card). It's good.

I played Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer a few times before buying this. I like Ascension a lot (I have a preference for deck-building games), but I don't think it stands out enough to buy the full version. The mechanics and strategy are pretty similar to many of the other games I play and I don't like the artwork that much. The Apprentice version is only $10 though and adds a little something different to our game collection.

This is great - a very easy to learn quick two player game which is small enough to carry anywhere and wont hurt the wallet.  Grab some tokens from one of the full size expansions and you're good to go.

Rates an 8 as a solid, balanced, introductory deck-builder, and goes up to 10 for value. What a deal for six bucks. Nice cards, great artwork, playmat, and tokens. This reminds me a lot of Star Realms (which is good), except it takes a little longer to play (still under 30 minutes) and it's less confrontational. I like how simple the rules are and how smoothly it plays. Love the artwork. I'm going to be playing this a lot more and plan on getting some of the bigger decks. I think I like the solo rules even more than the 2-player game, because it goes on a little longer and gives me more of a chance to build out my deck.

Excellent introduction to Deck-building games in general and the very simple ascension system in particular. Gameplay is straightforward and games take about 40-50mins. This pack is an absolute bargain at under £10 for over 100 cards and plays exactly the same rules as its big box counterparts. Good solid game even if you never buy a bigger version or another deck-builder. Great if you want a low risk intro to the game type.

Fast and smooth gameplay, and there are some nice combos, but overall, the ending where you just count points, and every single card is worth something, so you have to keep buying them even if they're no good and can't take them out of your deck... is just so anticlimactic. Star Realms 100% killed this, it has all the fast and smooth gameplay and combos, but with actual strategy, and tension.

Ascension to me seems to work best as a 2 player game, so a center deck built around that is a great idea.  No new unique cards, bu it seems to be a "best of" of all the sets which came before.  Added benefit is that there is very little fluff to this version in terms of components. I already have way more Mystics, Heavy Infantry, and Apprentices than I know what to do with.  I hate that I have to shell out ~$40 every time a new set comes out when all I want is 100 playing cards, with many duplicates included even in that number.  I understand I'm paying for more than the physical production of the game, but can't StoneBlade just sell me a center deck and a rule book without including everything else?

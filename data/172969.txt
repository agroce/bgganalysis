There are certainly some inter-set character combos that will work more than others, but the fact that you now have so many characters to mix and max, so many potential options on how to play them in combination...it's stunning, and this is a truly unique 2 payer game which deserves far more attention. That said this doesn't feel quite as coherent as the previous boxes, but only because it was originally planned as a few smaller packs and then combined.

There is a LOT to be determined through multiple playthroughs as the icons and manual leave a great deal unexplained.  But once you DO decipher it, hoo-boy - you are in for one of the absolute MOST strategic card games I've played in a while.  The sheer number of options on each card mixed with the flexibility of your actions AND the special effects of each hero guarantees no playthrough will ever be the same.

Great little card game.  Amazing play for such a small thing.  Rated 7 across the board.  Every expansion is just more of the same.  You don't like one, you don't like 'em all.

Pixel Tactics 5 takes place in the same world and uses many of the characters from Level 99 Games' BattleCON: War of Indines, but its gameplay is entirely unrelated.

Fun and tactic, each card gives lots of options and choices.

Maybe too many choices. The game can slow down if players take too much time to decide, and it's easy to forget an effect or trigger.

Compared to Pixel Tactics 1, the cards feel more narrow and require some more setup. Good as a expansion, would not recommend as your first Pixel Tactics set.

Bought at Kingslayer Comics 2/20/15.

I appreciate the idea behind it, but in the end, it's overcomplicated for what it needs to be.  Since every card has different abilities depending where you put it, it results in a LOT of re-reading cards.  This is a 10 minute filler game that takes 45 minutes.

New set of Pixel Tactics stuff.  This game thrives on new options and Level 99 really has done a great job of coming up with new and creative abilities for their heroes in each set.

This set is actually a combination of the announced Black Ops, Sealed Secrets, and Final Frontier minipacks which begs the question why those three still have their own BGG entries?

Enjoy this game a lot, love the challenge that Germany has in this one especially. Maybe not the best axis and allies and unlike 1940 cannot be combined to a super game with pacific (well not easily mind you). Still a big fan, second axis and allies variant I ever owned.

3 vs 1 Axis and Allies.  If you really like the Germany battling USSR part of the original A&A, you may like it.  I'd prefer the original, as I feel it has more viable strategies and encompasses the entire world.

Rating with the original [i]Axis & Allies[/i].  Got this one mainly because I liked the original.  Nice components which introduce different appearances for the various armies (e.g., German submarines don't look the same as American submarines).  With as rarely as I play the original, not sure this adds much to my collection.  It did try to add some interesting variations (such as certain benefits granted to the player that controls the oil-producing countries in the Middle East).  

Not different enough from the original to warrant a different rating.

I wouldn't say it's bad per se, it's just not for me. Way too complex, with a gazillion rules. Setting up the game seems to take forever.

Very 'dicey' easy to play game.  Has some interesting new mechanics, such as convoys in the North Atlantic, Middle East influence, and revised submarine rules.  Also has new units such as destroyers and artillery.  However, game play is so-so.  The components are excellent.  Rulebook is clear and has many examples.

RATING: 4
Upon further reflection, while the game had potential, there are issues with the map (both in terms of ergonomics and with the design choices) that drastically reduce the game's enjoyment. A pity, honestly, because a game of this scale and difficulty level would be a godsend.

Good game in the A&A series. Added a few new units to the '81 arsenal, gave the ability to disrupt supply routes, and added a few new rules for realism. A decent buy, though if a gamer was serious about it, I would wait for the A&A: Europe 1940 version.

The only spin-off of the original A&A design that is any good, IMO.

Thematically, I LOVE this game.  I'm a huge history fan and the Eastern Front in WWII is a fascinating topic for me.  I also really like the extra detail of Eastern Europe that lets you maneuver a little more than the basic world-map game.  My only complaint is that this game seems to have a very set sequence of moves.  Most A&A games are like that since they all start with a standard setup of pieces and territories, but this one seems to play out more predictably than any of the other versions.

Less good than the world version and especially for the player who was so unlucky to draw United States. With three players always combine US with another player otherwise it is too boring for that player. But A&A Europe has also some neweties that makes the game different, and a lot of them are taken over in the new world version of A&A

I like the increase in depth over the original.  The problem, like the original, is the inability to come back from the pit once the allies turn the corner.  When I game, I am not looking for a historical simulation... I am looking for a fair and winnable fight if I use good strategy and tactics.  A&A, in all forms, seems to go for the simulation.

Played a couple times and the game boils down to "The Stack." Bascially, a clash between huge stacks of the German and Russian armies will determine whether the game ends immediately after the battle; or if it drags on for another few hours.

RATING: 3
It seemed that there were hardly any interesting decisions to be made given how much time took to set it up and play it.  Germany invades Russia and if they succeed before the U.S. and England show up, they win.  Is there anything more to it than that?

It's really a strategy game especially when you play Germany, you will try to handle all of your strategy at all fronts, yes we play with dice, but believe me, if your strategy sucks then dice are nothing!!

Cambiado en la bsk en Marzo 2012 a Loberas por un Dragon's Gold.

Las reglas son similares al juego bÃ¡sico, pero incluye una variante econÃ³mica (oriente medio), y tiene nuevas unidades (artillerÃ­a y destructores). TambiÃ©n el mar se vuelve importante en recursos (convoys). Alemania se enfrenta a Rusia, inglaterra y USA por ese orden. Las distancias del tablero han cambiado. Ya no es posible llegar a Francia en un turno. Mantiene la filosofÃ­a del juego clÃ¡sico, pero con variaciones muy interesantes. Me gusta.

Cambiado en Mathtrade de 2014 y se lo tenÃ­a que enviar a tirupiru, pero tenÃ­a tratos con otro usuario, y al final se lo envie a jmkinki. A cambio recibÃ­ un In the YEar of Dragon. Me dio mucha pena deshacerme de Ã©l, pero no veÃ­a mesa nunca... y no parecÃ­a que fuera a cambiar.

RATING: 4.5
I don't think this game plays very well. 

To be sure, there are a few good ideas here: artillery are a welcome addition, and the convoy mechanic nicely spices up the Battle of the Atlantic.

But really, there is only one possible German strategy--build a gigantic stack and send it at Russia. And there is only one possible Allied strategy--build a gigantic stack of Russian infantry, augmented by American and British fighters, hold out, and eventually grind the Germans down with economic superiority. There's really nothing else to it. Typically the Allies have the advantage in this slugfest but either way it's not that exciting. Japan was really a dynamic presence in most Axis and Allies games, and their absence is sorely felt here.

I also rather dislike the fact that Germany's wolf packs and air force can (and should) completely sink the Royal Navy on Turn 1, with Britain unable to do anything about it. Necessary for game balance? Perhaps. But it's very bad history and playing Britain without any ships is not a fun time. I believe Germany begins the game with more boats than Britain which is just ridiculous.

If you want a Europe-only Axis and Allies game, the 1940 version is much better.

GOOD:
I love  A & A. Fun to play just ETO with miniatures. A "mainstream" gaming company finally did something with A & A after 15 years of doing nothing with it. More complex than Milton Bradley A & A. New pieces! Convoy boxes are fun.
BAD: 
Pieces too big so the board can get cluttered pretty easy at times. Just buy    
Infantry and Armor with Germany and attack Russia full force and you will win 70% of the time. Needs house rules to make more interesting.

I have reconsidered my initial assessment of this game.  It has great pieces, a great map, and ends in 120-150 minutes.  However, the game should not be played with four players... three is ideal.  Destroyers are TOO powerful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a fun game.  I like the new rules that Mr. Harris added for this version.  

The problem is that it basically comes down to whether Germany can take Russia.  In every game I've played, the German throws his entire might against the Russian forces.  If Moscow falls, he wins.  If it doesn't, he loses.

So this is basically an operational simulation of the eastern front in the european theater of war.  The rest is really a side show.  

I feel bad for the U.S. player...usually, by the time he has sufficient build up to be in a position for a D-Day like operation, the game has already been decided.

RATING: 5
Despite a lot of issues, this is still a sort of fun game. The two key problems: the Germans will tend to win in the first 4 turns or so or not at all, meaning the Allies (especially the US) typically hardly get to play. Secondly, the Germans will rarely win anyway. If you could do something to make the last half of the game playable, so the Germans could still "win" without conquering the world, this could be a good game. Despite this, it's still fun to play once or twice, but doesn't have much repeat draw.

The game introduces some cool ideas into the regular Axis & Allies mechanics such as convoy zones and new units: destroyers and artillery. Same as in regular A&A, Germany starts off strong and needs to blitzkrieg into Russia.  The allies are weaker militarily and need to use their greater collective economy to outproduce and land the D-day invasion.  Very scripted and overstays its welcome.  I likely won't ever play this again.

Nice to play only a part of the big A&A game as a game on its own. It is a pity that there is a rather fixed stream from Germany into Russia, which determines the game heavily.

RATING: 3
This game sufferes from the same faults of the original (non-intuitive combat calculations, dependance on dice) but it is also VERY poorly balanced.  After playing this version of the game off and on for 10 years we still cannot possibly win with Axis.  That is a major game flaw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Strong entry in the Axis and Allies family. Addition of convoy boxes is key, as U-Boats now finally mean something! The historically accurate minis are incredibly cool! The game play is solid. The Axis do seem to have a bit more of an edge than perhaps they did historically, but not unreasonably much. Our group really likes this one and we recommend it.

Update (3/9/08): Dropping my rating a bit from 8 to 7. Still a great game, but from now on, we are playing with the house rule that for Germany to conquer Russia, the Germans must take all three major Russian cities, Leningrad, Stalingrad, and Moscow. After repeated play, our group has decided that needing to take only Moscow to conquer Russia seems just a bit too manageable for the Germans. 

Beyond the plays I've logged here at BGG, I estimate I've played this ~5 times prior to my logging of plays.

I like that it takes out more of the water.  The US, UK, and Japan are not terribly fun for me to play in most versions of Axis and Allies because it's so much about ships, and if yours get blown up, you just sit around building them again.

Found that the gameplay was good, though the Axis player has too much of an advantage, and as a result more interesting and involved turns, and that the spaces on the board were too small. Also, pieces were a bit fiddly and difficult to distinguish from each other. Well thought out battle mechanic, but given my luck, found it a bit frustrating, especially as the Soviet player.

RATING: 5
I like the subject and general implementation, but the Axis needs to do very well on the first few turns or it just becomes a long, drawn out exercise in losing a war of attrition. Yes, maybe that's historical, but I feel a game this simple and streamlined should be better balanced. Europe Engulfed is a much, much, better take on the subject matter, if you don't mind some added complexity.

Bottom line: great production, great theme, lots of style, solid rules, bad balance. As a game, it ceases to be fun after a couple tries. I don't believe you can win as Axis, unless your opponent is inept or you are incredibly lucky.

My group found this game decidedly unbalanced in favor of the Germans. All they have to do is build tanks, build tanks and then build some more tanks and head them all east as fast as possible. This causes Russia to fall before the western allies can take Germany out. We found that if the allies only actions are to reinforce the Russians ever chance they get, including building and flying in bombers and fighters to the maximum extent possible, the Russians have a chance. But only a chance. Otherwise it's over. True, the Allies have more economic power than the Axis but they have a very hard time preventing the Russian collapse, when the Germans concentrate on that one objective to the exclusion of all others. This makes for a stylized game with limited replayability. Bottom line: Unbalanced, unhistorical and uninteresting.

This expansion relies less on chance than the World and Pacific scenarios, since you have tons of dice to roll.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not exactly a bad one, if you like throwing huge amounts of dice. Through our first couple of games it was great, then the strategies started repeating themselves a lot. Finally a big German stack to Moscow just became too boring. Also, you can see it from a mile away if the German is going to lose eventually, so our games pretty much ended in early surrenders. Only once have I played it to the bitter end with the Germans losing, which was quite nice to see but took far too long.

However I like the way how the game can be used to explore some of the possibilities of WWII, like for example whether or not to launch an American invasion of North Africa or go straight for Europe, whether to concentrate Western unit production on lendlease or for its own operations, or whether as Germany to support the African campaign for that nice right hook around the Soviet left flank and score some oil points directly out of Allied hands or just hammer at the east with all your might. However, the game is designed so that most Germany players end up giving everything else the boot and pushing to Moscow with everything they have. 

And yes, you should only play with three players, combining the command of Western allies to one. That way it doesn`t get so boring in the early game to play the Americans, which are after all vital to the Allied cause and require an active player.

Also a point of criticism on my part is the practice of pitting up to three players against just one, with the game lasting many endless hours. While the isolation can be fun at times, at others it just doesnÂ´t provide a very good atmosphere.

Same old A&A, but for some reason it doesn't grab me like the original version.  I was expecting the "Battle for the Atlantic" to add more spice, but it is easily countered by an American Sub force, which is totally ahistorical.  Would be much better if the American was not allowed to build subs.

If you like the base A&A game, this puts a nice focus on that by zooming into Europe.  I have yet to find a strategy that enables the axis to win, though, so we may be trying some house rules or something.  With my recent interests in Europe Engulfed, this game may not see the table as much anymore.  EE is pretty much a superior game in all ways, but for a simpler, A&A feel, I'd still give this a go if offered.  (Gotta figure out how to win with the Axis one of these days)

Great game in many respects once it gets rolling. But like all the A&A games, it takes too long to set up, and every game begins the same way, which limits it's replayability and leaves players ultimately finding a trump strategy in the end (assuming no crazy twists of luck).

Of course the odds are against the Axis. But it is interesting to see how long the Axis player can survive. Sometimes we play a "Cold War" after Germany has been defeated. Lots of interesting new features, but the sheer volume of units, and time spent on battleboard, should be adressed. Changed rating from 8 to 7.

Too many pieces on too small of a board makes for slow setup, but gameplay moves along at at brisk pace compared to the original, and the new rules, destroyers, and artillery were a welcome addition (this was one of the first enhanced editions of A&A). I did not like the convoy rules which were too hard to keep track of--I hate having to go back to the darned rulebook every time. The increased detail in and around Europe is probably the most important change in this game, since separating the original world map into two parts (with A&A Pacific being a sister game) makes it possible to focus attention on one or the other. You lose some of the fun factor of conquering the "whole world", but the gameplay is more interesting this way, allowing for quite different strategies. Unlike the original, it's very hard for Germany early in the game!

Initial rating based on solo play of a few turns.

A nice change from the full war versions of the game.  The convoy boxes give the German navies something to do and keep the Wallies from building up too quickly.  The war in Russia is very tense.  As easy as the basic A&A games with enough variety to make this replayable.

Good variation and map, but same thing happens every game, Germany attacks Russia.  I'd hate to be Russia.
Has really differences to the original, but lacks players and variation, as Germany basically attacks Russia each game and everyone else is simply trying to help them survive each game until Germany wigs out and loses.
nice theme and dice fest, if that doesn't kill you right there.

I don't like this as much as A&A: Pacific, as the Germans seem to have less choice as to where to attack, but it's still fun.  The A&A system translates better to this scale than it does to the A&A: D-Day scale, as far as I'm concerned.  If I have the time, I'd rather play Europe Engulfed, but for a Saturday afternoon, this is a fine game.

Like this game better than most of the Axis and Allies expansions, but I don't really yearn to play it.

Update.  

This game feels like a puzzle to be solved.  War in the Atlantic seems obvious, Sea Lion nearly impossible, so that leaves only Typhoon.  Seems difficult for the Allies to contest the Med or North Africa unless they are lucky.

Quite a "dicey" game.  And replay value seems limited... just don't believe there are that many strategic options to explore in this game.

-----------------------------------------

Earlier comment:

As in history, this game will most often be decided on the Russian Front.  Sea Lion is much, much harder than Operation Typhoon to pull off.  

Not much for the US player to do for a quite a few turns, so this game is probably better as a 3 player game.

Unsure about play balance as I've only played this a few times and am unlikely to play enough to form an opinion.

The most similar of the game family to the original - which allows for a short rules explanation for experienced players.

After just one play, I actually prefer this to the Axis and Allies Revised Edition. The simplified map with the focus on Germany seemed to give each player more of a focused strategy. Still, like all A&A games, the luck of the dice plays a big part and the game feels like a tug of war that might never end. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and may have to give A&A Revised another try.

Fun game to play occasionally.  I liked it a lot more before I got further into german gaming and discovered there were many better games than this one.  Haven&#039;t played it much since then.  We always had four player games on saturday afternoons that were pretty fun.  I enjoy being the German player as the strategy is difficult to work out.  Forming a concertive team effort as the allies also makes for a fun time.  Now that I talk about it, I need to dig it back out and give it another go.  Also, the bits with the game are fantastic, as is expected with an Avalon Hill title.

All in all an excellent version. I still break this out once in a while(even though it has been replaced by Europe '40, I still like the original release, especially the naval and convoy system and sub warfare rules. Russia is finally well represented, Germany still has the initiative, but it is almost always hard pressed to last till ultimate victory against the combined might of the Allies.

I'm an ex-fan on Axis and Allies.  The game takes too long to set up and play for what its worth.  The first bunch of times we played the Germans could not win, until they used an unrealistic strategy: build men.  After that, there was nothing the Allies and Soviets could do to stop the mass of Germans invading.  Moscow would fall before USA/Britain could build enough to clear the subs out of the Atlantic.  The game was solved.

An OK game with nice playing pieces, overcrowded areas and a tad slow gameplay.

Fun the first time you play it, but not especially creative. Only the Eastern Front really matters, as you can't achieve anything decisive on the Western Front (the Germans can't possibly hope to invade England), so everything is nothing more than a holding action in Western Europe.

It misses the depth Pacific does have. And In my opinion it's too easy for the Axis to win. The tentative 6 I give it now has to do with the rules change we made to make the game more interesting. Upcoming variant will be posted as soon as I have the time to do that. The variant focuses on saving time, and streamlining game play in accordance with A&A Revised.

We play with a variant which works rather well. It's a combination of Revised ruling with A&Ã Pacific Victory type victory conditions for both sides. The variant has only been played two times but it does allow for a 7 in rating, based on my own two plays and players responses.

Probably the worst of the Axis and Allies games that I have played.  The new units are fun.  The map is cool.

Looks amazing....actually if it was only on looks, it would be a 10.  Play, though, is maybe a 6-7.  The biggest part of that is because I am a little disappointed at how much of an advantage the Germans have in this one.  Where in reality, the Germans were getting their butt kicked.  If I were rating this game on historical value, it would be much, much lower.  But this one is a game and if you take it for that, it is a fun game.  It looks really cool, and plays well (with the exception of seeming to be stacked in the Germans favor) for the most part.  All things considered and because of my attachment to all things A&A, I think an 8 is a fair rating.

The game doesn't have enough pieces for you to set it up (as per the set up instructions) and you have to sub-in coins, that doesn't bode well at all...

Having now played it... it is okay. It's too long, the Americans really have very little to do for three hours, the winner is basically determined in the first few rounds and there isn't really any replayability as it is basically scripted (Germany: take Russia or lose). Not one to seek out.

Does not feel NEARLY as well balanced as the original. I did a few test runs with this, and found that there is a definite recipe for success as Germany. It is: On first turn, gather your forces on Russian border. On second turn, push into Russia hard, while also working to get the Middle East and keep the Allies out JUST long enough for you to take Moscow. Even giving Russia ALL the starting money does not save them.

A better game than the original.  Newer pieces and rules make the game more interesting, while the focused map intensifies the experience and gives secondary objectives.  After a number of replays, the game basically breaks down the same as the original did, but it's simply more fun.  This is better with more players, though, as a completely unified ideology by the Allies (when all 3 countries are played by one player) tips the scales too much in their favor.

Fixes a lot of problems with the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98]older original edition[/url].  The addition of the extra units is good, but not absolutely necessary. From the handful of times I've played, seems well-balanced.  Often comes down to who makes the first big mistake.  Sadly, doesn't have the same epic feel as the original.  A rather solitary experience for the German player if you're playing with more than two players.  Allies get to discuss plans, but German player can't talk to anybody.  That said, I enjoy the game best with three players.

I remember with eager anticipation awaiting the arrival of my copy of A&A Europe, after having played A&A for so many years.  I wasn't disappointed.  By focusing on the European theater the game gets more tactical, less gridlocked, and more historical.  The new pieces are top notch and the map is beautiful.  The only thing I didn't like are the Russian/American country colors and that's nitpicking.  Otherwise, this game gets two thumbs up!

There's not a whole lot here that isn't in regular Axis and Allies, aside from a few minor additions it's just the normal game restricted to the European theater. I don't like this nearly as much as A&A Pacific, because unlike that title, it doesn't feel tactically deeper than regular Axis and Allies. The worst part of vanilla Axis and Allies was always the German-Russian front. Russia just spends the entire game buying a million infantry and throwing them in front of the German tanks. While I appreciate the historical accuracy, it makes for a very tedious game from the viewpoint of the Russian player. Despite a few additions to try and add some new strategies here and there, it doesn't take long for this game to devolve into that same old fight. The rest of the game almost doesn't matter, as it will usually be decided by whether or not the Russian infantry can outlast the German Panzer onslaught.

Historically accurate - yes. Fun to play - Not so much.

I was surprised and annoyed when the killer German strategy (Big Stack) was found, but I think it can almost be countered, making that approach boring and risky.  It's still probably the optimal strategy as Germany, but it's all or nothing.  The new rules (artillery, subs, destroyers, etc.) make for a better, less predictable game than the original.  Still a dice-fest, of course, but not in the pejorative sense.

The one missing element is a VP clock of some sort (ala A&A Pacific), so you have tension even after the outcome becomes apparent.  But really it's five to eight very fun turns, and then a resignation (who plays this to literal completion?).

A&A: Europe uses the same system as the original Axis & Allies, although now the focus of the game in on the European theater of WWII. Two new units have been added to the game (destroyers and artillery) and there are some modifications to the rules and overall strategic scenario.

This just somehow doesn't seem to captivate me like those old AH titles even though the bits are much nicer.

Bought it after enjoying the original so much.  Honestly bought it partly for the pieces that don't match the original >:(  In the end it was just an okay variation.

Good strategy game, with some resources management too. Too long.

I found this one to be flawed and ultimately frustrating. But I will hold onto it. Just can't part ways with this venerable brand.

The game balance is quite poor, I would recommend A&A Pacific instead.

More fiddly than Risk. Scratches my war-games itch when it acts up.

Terribly balanced.  There are so many better games out there.....

RATING 7: When I think about it, I've probably had more fun playing this game than any other game I can think of.  I have not played it in a few years; that might be because I left my copy with my BFF, Ryan, in California who was my primary opponent.  I miss him and I miss the game.

11/30/05 - I think this game, for me, owes a lot more to nostalgia than actual game play.  The game becomes scripted and drawn out.  Rating has dropped to a 6.

Balance? Naaaa, balance is for sissies, I'd rather the Nazis win every single game.

Long and slow, but once it starts very exciting. On the long run bad, because only one scenery the game provides tends to became boring after while.

RATING: 4
a boring variant of the mother game, very unbalanced towards the germans and no real alterternative if you have any other variant of the axis & allies series at hand.

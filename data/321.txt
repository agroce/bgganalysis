Simple and elegant.  Seems like it would be as good for adults as it would be for kids.  I'll have to get my own copy now!

Update: Got my own copy within a week.  Taught my 6-year-old daughter, and she can even play with the expert rules.  Good game!

Good original idea, but for some reason it is difficult to place your moles there where you need them. It all depends in the chit you draw.

A good opportunity to create a great strategy game has been lost. Now it looks too childish.

RATING: 6
For kids. Game mechanics is fun. It's dice throwing, but after the mole holes are occupied, the top layer of the game board is lifted up and the next layer is revealed, leaving those players buttons left, which were in the holes. The number of empty holes decreases every layer and finally there are only few buttons left and it's the final race for the golden showel. With good luck, you can still compensate for bad strategy. I would say this is 60/40 luck/skill game.

RATING: 8
Excellent children's game.  They learn to memorize the six number tiles so that they can anticipate what numbers are left to come up.  They also learn how to make moves that limit their opponents' mobility while maximizing the number of "in the hole" move opportunities for themselves given what numbers they have left in their tile stack.  Fantastic game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyable and different simple race game with a very nice production which really enhances it.  The moles make a dash for the empty holes and, once they're all full the board is lifted off, taking the extra moles with it, to reveal the next level - which has fewer holes of course.  A couple of levels later the winning moles makes it though the sole hole to win the golden shovel.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun enough for a family type game or a game to play with older kids.  The randomness of movement allowance each turn keeps it pretty unpredictable, but you can try to plan ahead or block other players with your less useful moves.  Pretty neat how pieces are gradually eliminated from round to round until there's only one left!

Pretty fun game to play with children, and my wife enjoys it too alot, but after a couple of games it gets "old" but thats just me.

And im not sure i like the last layer before the shovel, it feel like its mostly a random winner, the player that draws the right card, on the other layers there was some more tactical choices in my opinion. But thats maybe fixed with some homemade variant.

Got the Scandinavian edition: Under The Ground (1995)

UPDATE: okey played this game now with 4 people and it was so much better, i really must say play this game with a minimum of 3. Raising the rate from 6.5 to 8.0

We play 2-player.  This is a fun family-friendly game that requires more thought than it would first appear.  You have to pay attention to which numbered tokens are still available to each player, and must carefully use your moves to position your own pawns and block others.  The way that the layered board is created out of the gamebox is a neat idea.

Fantastic little game.  The rules are simple. The components are attractive. The play time is nice and quick.

This is a great game to play with children or the grown-ups. After my first playing I immediately purchased a copy. I'm looking forward to playing it more the next time we have a family gathering.

The game itself is a glorified version of musical chairs, but it just works.

RATING: 6
Components: Very clever box design, and fun boards that represent different strata of the earth.

Experience: I really liked it at the top level, when there were so many moles everywhere and I had many options for resolving my movement disc. I liked it less the deeper we got, when my moles began in arbitrary positions relative to the new holes, and I felt more at the whim of the random draws.

Great little game where players are trying to navigate their moles into holes, in order to keep playing.  The game is played on a multi-layered board, in the game box itself.  As the holes on the current board are filled with moles, the board is lifted out, removing any moles from the game who didn't find a hole.  The remaining moles keep playing.  Last mole standing wins.  Fun game - the moles look pretty cool too.

Played 1 time. Played with gamers in a 3 player game, and we really enjoyed it. At first it seemed kind of random (there is quite a bit of luck), but we began to see blocking possibilities and set yourself up based on moves you know are coming up. Very cool 30-minute gamne. And the best part is, kids will like it too. Simple, with a bit of thinking, and a good dose of luck.

RATING: 7.8
I rate children's game according to the interest I have in playing them with the appropriate age group.  The box say 8+, but a 4 year old can play this and I think, up to 8 years, where a different level of game becomes more interesting.

I appreciate game boards that can have a different setup each game, as this one does.  The game is also printed for a game play modification which adds variety to the basic game.  This fast, simple little game has movement strategy, and a different mechanic with a shrinking game board.  Nice components.  Quality game.  Very enjoyable.

The board uses the box insert for setup.  If the insert becomes unusable the game can still be played, but the board isn't as secure or as easy to lift off layers.

Best with more than 2, however somebody probably won't make it to all the lower layer, but the game goes very fast especially the deeper the moles dig.  Top rated child's game & is on many lists.

RATING: 6
A unique abstract with an amusing theme.  Mole in the Hole is a tactical exercise that literally plays on multiple levels, as the game board is stripped away each round revealing a new one.  The weight/time ratio is in balance as the game lasts at most twenty minutes but provides adequate decision making for the time frame.  This could be a strong introduction for new players into pure abstract games, as it does have a fun theme involved.   Elimination is possible, but as mentioned above the play time is quick enough to not make this an issue.  The extreme skater moles are a nice touch.

While ostensibly a children's game, I've had a lot of fun playing this with adults. In fact, younger children may find it difficult to see all the movement options. The closest comparison here is probably Hey! That's My Fish, which is a much cleaner and simpler design, probably with more strategy. Nevertheless, the table appeal of the multi-layered board can't be understated. As a game that can be pulled out for kids but also makes a great filler for adults, Mole in the Hole has earned a place on my shelf for years to come. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A light but entertaining little game. Since you usually do not know in andvance how far you can move your moles, planning ahead is only possible in a very limited fashion. Nonetheless, the game does not take very long, downtime is quite low, and removing the different layers of the game board to discard the moles that did not make it is strangely enjoyable.

This is a children's/family game - so treat it like one.  Simple rules, colourful pieces and a quick playing time.  Even if a player is eliminated they don't have to wait long for the next game.  Good players should find that the game comes down to the random draw of tokens, but as a family experience it's a very good game.

You could always play with the move tokens face up, but that takes a lot of the family atmosphere away.  Children enjoy the race for the golden shovel, but the lifting of the boards to reveal the next playing surface are definite highlights as well.

Die Maulwurf Company does an excellent job with the idea of a modular board in 3D space with each board stacked on the other.  It's hard to explain, but I like the randomness of the movement, gaining knowledge of how many spaces you'll be able to move with each move card being played.  Another great children's games which plays well even with adults.

Can be fun for the younger crowd, but the luck of the draw can be a big factor. Also, the ability to get eliminated from the game can be hard for some younger kids.

One of the few childhood games I still have, so just sort of a classic. Somehow I just still find it cute.

RATING: 6
Predecessor to Hey! That's My Fish, complete with multiple player pawns, 2-4 player support, a heavy blocking element, and a quick pace as more and more pawns get eliminated. This one is a little less intense due to the random card draw, but interestingly the movement tiles actually add a bit of risk management and planning that wouldn't have otherwise been there. Far superior to using a die to move really. I wish I would see more games with this element.

RATING: 7.5
Ah, the golden shovel! Everyone wants one. This is a multi-level game...literally! You begin with a bunch of moles and as you jump in the holes (and all are full of moles) the top board is removed. This reveals a new level, but you are left with fewer moles. Eventually 1 mole will reach the golden shovel; the winner! Sweet little game!

This is an excellent game to play with 7-10 year olds. The theme is attractive, the inset-board is appealing, the gameplay is simple and the luck is exactly the right level to reward good play but also to allow anyone to win regardless. (The latter being also why it doesn't stand up that well in gamer groups.) It's a game that's stood up well over the test of time though and still gets pulled out by the family, mainly because it's just simple fun.

Why aren't children's games like this more widespread in the US? I know I'm preaching to the choir. This game is so dead simple, nice to look at, and satisfying to dig down into the box. We played it at about 2am after a long night of more serious games, and it was a lovely way to end the evening.

Kid's game? I'd only play this with kids I'd - for some reason - want to beat up. It has some relatively deep strategy.

An original idea, the holes of the first board are the departure positions of the second board.  So, you must file them with as much moles of your color as you can.  You repeat the same thing for the third and the fourth boards.  Ravenburger has done a terrific job, very nice components, but the game becomes repetitive.  Very good for children (8-12 years old).

RATING: 5
Another nice game for kids.  Simple mechanics with a little light decision making.  Advantage for kids is in teaching a bit of pre-planning.  The discs are fixed, so need to leave moves for the future if you don't want to move out of a hole.

RATING: 8
Good children's game. There is a really good balancing mechanism that works without it showing. THis means that a child has a chance of winning even if the adult tries to play well. THe board is fun. There is a lot of tactics and some strategy yet a child can play. Great game.

I play this game with my 5-year-old son and my 7-year-old nephew.  Enough luck for the kids to be competitive, but they can also start to learn some strategy.  The first board has too much chaos and starts to drag a bit with more than 2, though.  

Update: Kids are now 7 and 9 and this one still comes out often when they are together.

For when I get kids. But it's actually not a bad game as you can think and plan a bit knowing you have one 1, two 2, two 3 and one 4 in six turns instead of rolling a die.

RATING: 7
My original interest in purchasing this game comes from it's listing as 4th for the 1995 DSP.  The listing on the SDJ list and in the GAMES 100 didn't hurt either.  The attempt to place your moles in position to take advantage of the random (though limited) tile draws for movement in quite intriguing to me.  However, my youngest daughter (currently five) has won more than her fair share of these games.  In fact, if she gets a mole to the last level, she usually does win.  That gives some of the reason that it is popular around our house.  It will be interesting to see if she continues to do so well when as she develops a more sophisticated play style.  [02/02/2008]

RATING: 7
Clever and fun kids game. Players flip over a movement card and have to move a mole spaces as indicated in the card. The idea is to get your moles into burrow (holes). Once all holes in a level have been filled, the layer is removed and the process is repeated for the next layer of 'earth'. Each layer has lesser and lesser holes and in the last round, the player who gets his mole into the only hole wins!

Fantastic idea, clever components and there's also room for tactical play.

Interesting puzzle strategy going on - trying to get your moles (which are great minis) into the holes to dig deeper ... also a big hit with my son, so that's a plus.

Better than Inner Circle only in that you can't plot out solved moves.  Of course, you sacrafice control, certainly the movement system is better than if you rolled the dice, but really it is all about getting the right numbers at the right time.

It is unfortunate that the top grass layer looks like a field of filthy bungholes.

Still it is "totally rad" to move the retarded "Extreme" X-games moles around.

- At his heart it is a kid's game, so luck and randomness play a part in the game.

Great game with kids in which adult can be involved. Production value and gameplay is highly thematic. A great thrift store find.

Seems like a children's game, but there is some strategy.  Ingenious design of playing field and disc system means random factors are limited( Each person has six disks, 1-1, 2-2's, 2-3's, and 1-4.  Turn one over at random each turn untill you have used all your disks then reshuffle and start over.)  Great game for kids or very light filler for serious gamers.

RATING: 6
Tried once. Not so bad as a very light family game, but there's aplenty of shuffling moves: Due to randomly drawn tiles with move number, many times you can't do what you wish. To some degree this is required for tactical play, but nowadays it's a bit boring. The game itself is almost pure abstract logic with random factor, but theme fits well.

[Ravensburger 'Maulwurf Company, die' 1995 edition] {Animal; movement, player-elimination; optimal 4p}  Maulwurf Company is a fun family game.  It is thematic and interactive.  The mechanic matches the theme nicely.  There is some luck but good plays usually reward wins (just don't put too bet on a single movement disc).  It is a tactical game; nonetheless, having more 'survived' moles after each digging is one clear strategy.

The components are very nice.  4 sturdy boards with plastic moles.

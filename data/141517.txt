Great MW game! We played a 4-players games, and in the last, 3 loyalists lost to the single revolutionist because the latter shared the same low score as one of the loyalists!
Looking forward to the next game.

This game is perfect for me. It's hard to explain how amazing it is, because it has a serious flaw- it can outright suck when even one player who doesn't "get it" is playing. With five players who *know how to play* it's just the best.

I had heard about this game, but never played so was happy to get in on a 4-player experience. I really liked this one! The area control bit is serviceable, but what stood out to me was the winning conditions. You see there are two teams - each player receives a card that states which team they are on and this is kept secret (and becomes apparent during play). At the game end, whoever has a player in last - that ENTIRE TEAM loses. How cool is that? Even more so, our team won the game - but just *barely* avoided completely losing. The teams were 3 against 1 - but that 1 was nearly in second to last place (I think he missed it by like 2 points). If he had acquired 2 more points, our entire team would have lost. Although counter intuitive, that was really fun to experience. The winner had to really think through the point spread for all of us.

Other than that, the game theme is just very fun too - production values top notch I think. So big thumbs up from me.

RATING: 6
A thematic experience with beautiful illustrations. However, I feel that the full potential of the game has not materialized here. I wanted to experience more horror and fear of the inevitable with the game having a narrative of its own sending the players to the Mountains of Madness.

 When it comes to the mechanics, the use of cards was a bit counter intuitive which is so very typical of Mr. Wallace (refer to Brass and A Few Acres of Snow). As a deck builder, A Study in Emerald falls short of best titles due to the fact that your deck rotates just a few times in a game and hence there is little room for ingenious compositions.

You should read the short story, since it adds to the theme. Big plus for the art.

This was a mixed bag for me.  I like many elements of the game (the hidden teams, the asymmetrical goals, the awesome theme!), but other things just bothered me.  It seemed like it was too easy for the players to reveal their teams...and quite possibly let the game get lop-sided afterwards.  Plus, there were almost too many things to do...and many of them were not interesting.  I don't like having turn after turn of one lame choice after another.  A neat package, but not my favorite of Wallace's designs.

RATING: 7.5
+ The theme is beyond cool; The deck management along with travel on the board and secret goals seems really neat.
- Lots of fiddly pieces; hard to explain the scoring and the end-game team conditions.


Why it's previously-owned:
In practice, the hidden-loyalty mechanic felt too weird in the first playthrough.  If our group tended to play the same game dozens of times in a row, this one would have had a better shot of making it.
This got traded for Race! Formula 90.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A decent time to play (about an hour after the rules are learnt and played once or twice), has theme and manages to make so many different mechanics work together smoothly. It has solid and balanced gameplay from my perspective and the fact that not only must you try to find out who is in your faction but make sure they are not last, as then the whole faction loses, is very different from the usual and beyond that there is still one winner in the end as the best agent. It is my top semi co-op game as of this review. 
Downside is there can be many cards and some rules that would need many plays and checks with the rulebook to get right and the game can suffer from the wrong group. Example, a player who just heads for VPs and ends the game without bother of who is their allies. 
In conclusion, a solid game that works with Euro gamers and Theme gamers,not one not to be missed.

RATING: 7.5
It is a good game, uses a lot of mechanics, real time deck building, area control, conspiracy. The theme was pasted and in some cases we feel inside the theme, but the deckbuilding doesn't make you feel inside it. The art is very beautiful, a little bit overcolored, but it is ok. The team inside and outside competitive game is very interesting but I think there needed to be some refinements in the mechanics.

A little unsure after the first game; enjoyable however. Definitely the type of game you need to play repeatedly with the same group.

RATING: 6.5
Good production components. Beautiful map.

Secret identity evens out in odd player games, in a sense, it's best with 5 players. (2 vs 3) 
In other situations, it could end up all 3 players playing for the same side in a 3 player game. This identity is important as it defines how you would play the game and how you score to win.

This game felt like a redesign of acre of snow in a fantasy setting. The bomb cards like soldiers, cube movements and assassinations like battles. Even the city cards felt like town cards in acre of snow. Overall, just as enjoyable as AoS.

A mixture of worker placement, battles, sabotages, and deck building, ending with few victory point calculations on various tracks and tokens......so Wallace-like indeed.

RATING: 5
So Bob knows A Study in Emerald inside out; the rules, the cards, the strategy and the tactics.  He ought to win our game and yet he is randomly paired with Andy, who knows not his arse from his elbow.  Andy is rooted to the low end of the victory point track and, while that remains so, the victory conditions rule that Bob cannot win. Bob can help Andy though, can't he? Well, that assumes that Bob has deduced who his partner is (identities are secret) and even then he'll be struggling to boost his partner's score.  A study in futility. You will also appreciate how this victory condition can lengthen a game, with one or more players capable of accumulating a game-ending number of points, but fearing to do so and therefore playing negatively.   

Deckbuilding provides the basic engine of the game and it works tolerably well.  Set aside the theme for a moment and what's underneath is plain old cube placing and point harvesting.  Now bring back in the theme.  Yes, all of it: Sherlock Holmes, Great Cthulhu, anarchist bombers, vampires, zombies, double agents and Freemasons.  All of these things are more than just thematic window dressing, each brings rules, some of them not terribly well explained.    

A Study's artwork is nicely evocative of Victorian illustrations.  The board is rather busy, but reasonably functional.  Production quality is to a good standard.

RATING: 7
A little worried that the strategy of "just go for city cards" dominiates, since the game is boring if everyone does that. Hoping that it's just that other strategies are more difficult to play well, so we have to learn them before the game works as intended. Wish I trusted Martin Wallace more to have tried a playtest game where some players played this way.

Great fun. Definitely a game with lots of replay value. There is plenty of luck, and your plans can be ruined through no fault of your own, but the game tells a good enough story to make it worthwhile. Something really new, using familiar ingredients to create a game that feels fresh and interesting with some of the best elements of Euros, deck-builders, Ameritrash and the hidden-identity games like BSG.

Not bad, but playing as the loyalists the 2 of us were screwed up primarily by card draws and also the 1 experienced player winning convincingly. I'd like another game though.

RATING: 7
This is a gamers game and mechanically, it plays as a decent mash up of deck-building with card effects, area majority, and hidden identities for the two teams in the game.  The hidden identity winning conditions and double agent mechanics make for some interesting and fun situations for serious gamers, and I like the perversely peculiar names and historic feeling of the art as well as lots of cities to travel to, but beyond that, since I am not really a gamer who loves deck builders with card effects, I can't say I love this game beyond a basic 7 rating.  I might be willing to play it again because of the fun hidden identity winning conditions.  

Lastly, the game is quite fiddly and a very difficult teach.  And was it my imagination, or was the "going mad" mechanic silly or...was it essential to prevent the game from being broken?  Probably the latter.  Nevertheless, for me, it just felt silly.

RATING: 7
The old ones want to awaken and consume you.  This is either a bad thing or a good thing - depending on which side you are on.  And that is the central question in this Wallace title.  When played with a full compliment of players, some will be on the side of the old ones and some will be on the side of humanity.  The trick for the players is to determine which side the others are on.  How well this works has more to do with your players than the game though.  Visually the game is a bit of a horror.  The map board is complex with lots of artistic components.  It's neither perfect as a game board or as art.  The tokens are functional if drab.  The cards are functional if mostly blank.  So your play experience with this game isn't likely to be tied to the components.  Game play comes back to your fellow players.  And thus, it is the players that either make or break this game.  As such, it is hard to say how good or bad this game is.  It functions well and has some very interesting decisions - especially early on when identities are unknown.  But toward the end - you've gotten your team figured out or you have insane partners.  In the latter case, all you can hope for is that old ones arrive soon to correct the problem.  Recommended for fans of Gaiman, Lovercraft, or Wallace.  All others are advised to consider who is playing before venturing in too deep.

5/26/15: Received corrected counters from another BGG member.

1/14/15: There should be some replacement counters made available at some point in time.  See this thread: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/17999190#17999190.

1/18/14: Has some interesting timing mechanisms.  The real trick is to end the game when you it is right for you.  A little harder than it sounds.

In a longer game it's easier to figure out whose on which side, so I think that with experience it's one factor that will drive to shorter games.  One aspect that I'm a little concerned about is that if one person is behind, and you think that he's not on your side, there's a lot of benefit to piling on the loser.

The artwork is very nice, and the theme evocative.

Hidden teams, where only one person can win. And if the person with the lowest score at game end is on your team, you can't win.

This game sounds amazing if it has a full complement of players. But players need to understand the rules well. There was little chance of that happening with my group so focused on Dreadball.

RATING: N/A
Kickstarted this. Read the rules and loved the complexity and all the options. I really hoped for it to be a good game. And it was.
Need to play this again soon so that the rest of my gaming-group can get more accustomed to playing mind games, using the secret identities to their fullest, deck building and all of the other things that this game offers.

A fair warning though: this is one of the games that will have players suffer from AP, or only cling to one aspect of the game (such as area control). Also if all players stop building their decks (because they have descent enough cards) you might have a bit tougher getting through the piles, and getting the ones you want.
*Fix* When you introduce the game to players, tell them it's a deck-building game, put less emphasis on the area-control.

I love this game.  The theme is fantastic.  The board is beautiful.  I love the secret identities and how the strategy changes depending on what side you are on.   Replay-ability is excellent due to the limited number of cards per game.   The possible combinations feel pretty endless.  

It took many plays to really understand the mechanics, so if you feel confused or frustrated, keep with it.  It's worth it!    When I first acquired the game, I hadn't played any deck building games before.  I think it's pretty important to understand that particular gaming format first.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game truly embodies its Lovecraftian theme with its non-Euclidian, plentifold and alien paths to victory. It is well and truly awash with multiple systems and is quite possibly the craziest deckbuilder I've seen. I particularly like the way the game doesn't grind to a halt towards the endgame, but instead speeds up and narrows the fight. The faction design is ingenious, in that even if one side has a hefty numbers advantage, the design of the game is such that "teammates" should end up aggressively attacking each other. It's a clever game, dripping in theme and with numerous clever interlocking systems. A winner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Talk about your mashups!  This is a kitchen sink sort of game with elements of area control, deck-building, hidden-roles, Cthulu, 19th century anarchists, Sherlock Holmes, Zombies and Vampires.

If that sounds like a circus to you, you probably have the feel of it.

As with any involved game it's hard to get a good impression from one play (especially since the distribution of cards means that every game will often have wildly different options available)

The good (upon first impressions):  The hidden role stuff combined with the fact that no matter how far in first play you might be, you will lose if the last place person is part of your faction.  This is especially tricky since there are no team victories -- only one player will win.  

This creates all sorts of interesting situtations where you may need to help a rival (or at least refrain from hurtin them) in order to keep from losing, but doing so will also threaten your overall score.  

Very cool stuff.

The Bad (upon first impressions):
I find the scoring to be a little hard to manage.  There are important reasons to track mid-game scoring but many of the points are only "potential".  You will score differently based on whether you are revealed or secret.  Sometimes you are practically revealed but still need to score as if you weren't.  It can get a little clunky.

Worth a look.  My favorite Cthulu themed game so far.  Lots of potential.

Egy jÃ¡tÃ©k, ami tÃ¶bbet Ã­gÃ©rt annÃ¡l, mint amit adott.

Ami nagyon tetszik, az az alapÃ¶tlet, hogy a vÃ©gÃ©n a vesztes csapat minden tagja kiesik. Az mÃ¡r kevÃ©sbÃ© elegÃ¡ns, hogy a kÃ©t fÃ©l lÃ©tszÃ¡ma akÃ¡r 3-1 arÃ¡nyban is Ã¡llhat egymÃ¡ssal, szerintem ez sehol nincs kiegyensÃºlyozva, Ã©s egyÃ©bkÃ©nt is teszteletlennek Ã©rzem az egÃ©szet. A kÃ©t oldalnak totÃ¡l mÃ¡sok az esÃ©lyei, persze lehet hogy ezt azzal magyarÃ¡zzÃ¡k, hogy mivel Ãºgyis lutri az egÃ©sz, Ã­gy nem mindegy?:) De Ã­gy vÃ©geredmÃ©nyben nem igazÃ¡n van sÃºlya annak, hogy mit teszek, mert totÃ¡l bÃ©na jÃ¡tÃ©kkal is nyerhetek, hibÃ¡tlan jÃ¡tÃ©kkal is veszÃ­thetek.

A Study in Emerald is the game that brings Wallace back into the gamer's games field, after a few lighter fare designs.

It is a game I am quite thorn apart about, because is so full of contradictions...

Art is very evocative and rather good, but the graphic design is quite cloggy, with many distracting elements and super-tiny text on cards.

The idea of secretly dividing players in two camps, and make those in team with the worst lose, is sublime and very engaging, but could also lead to unfair losses when a team mate plays poorly.

Mechanics (deckbuilding Ã  la Few Acres of Snow, area majority) are (in gamer's games terms) very straightforward and cleverly implemented, but there's a lot of small thematic rules (zombies, vampires...) detracting from true essential elegance.

I quite liked my first game, and I enjoyed how the game tended to slowly reveal players' allegiances, bringing them to a tense open goals finale. Even if I lost in a weird 4 restorationists vs 1 loyalist game, because one of the fellow players performed very badly. I certainly want to play this game again!

Tentative initial rating is 7.5, but it could very well go up if I can feel control can somewhat be gained with repeated play.

A game with a very complex rulebook, winning conditions and extra rules. The actions though are clear, but it's hard to figure out how to play well. And I have to admit I'm not looking out for my next strategy. The game didn't catch me enough.

RATING: 7.5
I played the second edition first. Wallace's first edition provides a sandbox for the various agents to play in. Each player is given more tools and buttons to push as they work towards achieving the goals of the hidden faction. Given an optimal set of players involved in a session, the experience of the first edition is probably richer than the second edition. But, the additional rule overhead outweighs the potential for a richer experience, so the second edition gets played much more than the first edition.

After the nonsense of paying in March and getting it at the end of November, after Essen visitors could buy it a month earlier, I now find there are misprints that need stickers to fix. I'm so sick of the crap that has surrounded this release I find it hard to summon the energy to play it. But I did;

First Play: This game has the dubious distinction of being the one that after a first play has confused me the most. I am grateful to those who took the time to explain it to me as I think trying to learn this from the rule book would be a struggle in itself. However I was stunned by the need to chain link rules off into 'what-ifs' that meant nothing to me. The other three players tried to be helpful by chipping in with clarifications but at game start I was none the wiser as to the structure or finesse of the game. Half way through the fog still hadn't cleared. The other three players were engaging in in game conversations that I did not understand at all. I just tried to gain what I thought were useful cards and blocked the others off when I could. A permamnent effect card negated the zombies and vampires, meanwhile on another table the winner secured his victory with zombies because this card didn't appear. Was this played for or luck?

Game end came with a King-Making move that decided the winner and put him in last position. I was told this game played out totally different to other games. I am utterly confused as to whether I like the game or not. If I hadn't have bought it I would not at this stage buy it. Because I have it, I am encouraged to play again. Never has the jury been so far out. I rate it a 7 as a place holder until I sort my head out.

Having witnessed several games of this, its clear that there is significant randomness, arguably chaos, owing to the unpredictable actions of others. On reflection this is another game where I would always be teaching  new-comers and I wouldn't choose to play it as a first second or third option so my copy has been sold.

This game is that quirky girl we have all known. She may not fit the classic definitions of cool, or beautiful; but somehow you just can't get her out of your head.

Martin Wallace has done it again. How this quirky, unique game can live in the same stable with things like Brass, Automobile, and Age of Steam is astonishing. I doth my cap to the play testers, as well. This must have been a fun challenge, but a challenge nonetheless. Definitely a lot of method to this madness.

RATING: 5
The game has a lot of grinding, I get that, I take it from you kind of stuff. I feel that the deckbuilding mechanic doesn't fit here. What am I exactly doing, Why do I control agents whit 5 randomly drawn cards that give different domination of bombs, cubes and coins. The game doesn't feel finished and the mechanics and themes are not grounded in the game like for example his other game Brass. The double agent part feels like an unnecessary take that mechanic thats could potentially ruin a game experience for the player that is hit several times in a row. ï»¿

This is not my type of game, the experience  is so much dependent on who you play with. The game could grove on me with more plays. In its hearth the game is about who is who. Figuring that out with how people play. I rather play the resistance or Battlestar Galactica for a hidden role game.

RATING: 8.3
Like most Wallace games this one is pretty hard to learn from the rulebook. Not because the rulebook is particularly bad. It's just his games tend to be rather opaque. Even after an explanation by an experienced player most new players sit there looking glassy eyed stating: "let's just start and see what happens". And that's when the magic starts to happen.

The possible actions you can take first seem to give you an overwhelming choice. But after a few rounds your goals and the road there become clear. All the pieces start to fall in their place and it's not even that hard to figure out why other players take certain actions. And then we get to the best thing about A Study in Emerald. Most hidden role games lose their tension when all the identities are revealed. It becomes a race to the finish for the different teams. But not this game. Even with all the identities in the open the game remains tense and interesting. It becomes a balancing act, an exercise in timing to ensure your victory. All this because of the quirky winning condition. All players on the team with the lowest scoring player are eliminated. Brilliant! This will make you want to help your team mates to ensure them not being last. But if you help them too much they could threaten your own position. Keeping a player of the opposing team in last place can result in ganging up on the weakest link. The deckbuilding component is interesting enough to drive the game. The area influence adds to the tension and tug of war feel. But the most important feature of this game is the winning condition. The theme is a bonus as the anarchistic, Sherlock, Cthulhu vibe strangely fits the game. When played with the right people, because not everyone will appreciate it, this game will be a blast.

The hidden roles mechanic works much better than expected, but seems like the city control point swing could make the game last extremely long.  Will have to see if that gets better with repeated play (with a shift to pushing up the tracks, for instance, or assassination), or if it continues to be an issue.

I had no idea what I was getting into when I sat down to play this "deck-builder."  I found the team aspect and scoring to be very, very interesting.  In practice, I found the end game to include way too much back-and-forth with the city controlling between players.  Afterward, I realize there are more ways to score points than just cities but that did still seem to be significant enough to swing everything a bit too far.  I expect to play this again.

I'm loving this game and what Wallace achieved through it's design. A dynamic time of chaos and ingenuity is created and represented in "A Study in Emerald". The game experience is worth it alone putting a side trying to just min-max a game mechanic to optimize a winning strategy. Hidden objectives and motives along with randomized cards keeps the game fresh and each experience is a little different.

An unusual deck-building, bluffing and secret partnerships game; however, the partner/team aspect is only temporary.  First, your team must win by no individual having the worst score, then you can win if you have the highest score on the winning team.  It's an interesting game, but it doesn't really fit my tastes since I don't like bluffing/deception games.  Also, the double advance of the war track for each empty city seems to imbalance the game in favor of the _green?_ faction.

RATING: 9
My favorite review of this game calls it a "sandbox" game and that nails it. The circuity of this game is wired so cleverly and in such byzantine fashion that you are drawn into cooperation and tension with every other player on the board. The rules are difficult to intuit at first, and FAQ moments do come up frequently the first couple of games. However, once one digests the rules, the real mental and thematic engagement of the game comes from your own schemes and those of the other players. It's a game that is just built for emergent play. The only real criticism I can fathom is the tendency for things to get a little gamey near the end, allowing oneself to forget the theme. However, even then, the intrigue level is high, each player trying to outfox the other. You don't have to put any imagination into the theme because the decisions each player has made throughout the game rewards each player for playing in a thematically consistent fashion, making the the story arc support itself. I can't really think of a game to which to compare it. After a handful of plays it has to start at nine and may get to a ten after more sessions. Brilliant game.

This game will leave you screaming! Sadly, not with great theme, but with pure frustration. This is one my most irritating game experiences to date. I absolutely will not ever play it again.

2 plays.   It has the same Pax Porfiriana-feel of trying to pull everyone else back while slowly, quietly advancing yourself. There are two big differences. First, ASiE doesn't have the variability of the cards of Pax Porf. Games are more constrained but are unlikely to suffer from very bad card mixes. Second, AsiE develops the team aspect started in Pax Porfiriana and combines it with a hidden role mechanic. Also, I think ASiE has even more to keep track of Pax Porfiriana. There's less to worry about as far as what cards people are holding, but more to worry about as far as what cards have bids on htem and whose got cards to mess with you. Very hopeful to explore this more in 2014.

First almost moved out the agent thuesdays cubes that was his next claim. But changed my mind and removed another players cubes, that made agent thuesday think we where in the same team and that i wanted him to end the game since i let him keep the cubes. And agent thuesdays team lost since i removed cubes from his teammate, instead of him.

A Study in Emerald is an odd game, from its theme to its mechanisms. The first play will likely be underwhelming (mine was), but there is definitely a good game in there that will shine after a few plays like all other games where balance is player-driven. While not a game for everybody, I think ASiE is another Wallace title worth playing.
------------------------------
(June 2014) Nine plays in and ASiE is now my favorite title of 2013. Once the rules are mastered, the game offers incredible replayability and player interaction. I was not sure Wallace would surprise me again, but he's done it. This game is all kinds of awesome.

An interesting theme and ideas such as secret loyalties and winning conditions but the gameplay is actually quite dull. It's an improvement on Dominion because that game is essentially abstract but I really don't enjoy deck-building as a mechanic.  The loyalties pretty much get revealed as soon as players manipulate the pink or green scoring tracks as that would be a very expensive bluff. The miniscule font size on most cards is irritating.

I wanted to love this game, but it doesn't really work. Playing the Loyalist side is easier to win, but really boring. Ever played a 3 player game with 3 Loyalists? You'll be bored to death.

Cool thing about this game is how the lowest point scorer knocks the entire team out of the running, forcing the sides to determine a good way to trigger the end. It creates some really interesting scenarios, but also makes targets to pick on. The rest of the game is just ho-hum, best described as dominion deck building mixed into an area influence game. What really drags the game down are all the fiddly flavor bits (zombies, vampires, special cards) that require constant cross-referencing with the rules. The player aid barely contains all the little nuances and its the size of a sheet of paper. The game just isn't good enough to warrant learning or tracking the extras.

I was not expecting to like this, but it ends up being a very thematic Clans/Resistance mashup. Two of my favorite games mixed into a longer, theme-ier game. I am eager to try again now that I have the rules a bit more in hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
UPDATE: Frustrating as all hell; ASiE is in many ways an incredibly appealing game. The theme is rich and multi-layered and absolutely not decorative. The field of available options is broad but not overwhelmingly so, and this is absolutely positively unlike anything you've played before. Despite my negative initial reaction, I was totally up for giving it another try and I found myself initially enchanted by the game, with my head spinning around the multivariable calculus of my actions and the chaos that ensued.

But.

But the game devolved, for the second straight occasion, into a Munchkin Death Spiral where someone grabbed a city and moved into shoutin' range of the game ending conditions and then everyone would yank them back down, and then the cycle would cycle again, to the point that the last hour consisted of a lot of faffing about with our VP totals wildly ping-ponging up and down the track. Additionally fun was the fact that clear chances to win turn out to be poisoned chalices because of the clever-on-paper win conditions. (Having the most VP don't mean squat if your fellow Loyalist is dead last on the same track.) The fight for control of cities is (or, at least when we played, was) a disproportionate chunk of people's VP portfolios, and getting and hanging on to cities is just too. damn. hard. if the stars don't align.

I do suspect that there may be a good, potentially better than good, game in here for a group of 4-5 who are willing to play and learn together. But I expect that getting such a group together is unlikely in practice. I am so intrigued by the game that I can't bear to say it's no damn good, but I'm 0-2 so far with regard to actually having fun when I play. So yeah.

--

Very preliminary rating (and a game this dense deserves at least one more play through before dropping back and punting) but I was unmoved. ASiE is not a point salad but it is a mechanical salmagundi, with a bit of area control, a dash of deckbuilding, a whiff of social deduction, and more than a little take-that; it gives the distinct impression of certain things remaining in the game because screw it why not.

Wallace (and I mean this as no insult) is really proving himself to be to boardgaming what Woody Allen is to films: idiosyncratic, auteurish, constantly thinking about the next project and thus a) productive as hell and b) a bit alienated from what made people love his best work so much. 

Given that, I may be just missing out on the subtle unrecognized genius of Emerald (I cheerfully admit that I am biased against the endless parade of Lovecraft derivatives which doesn't help) but this could also be a misfire that is the inevitable outcome of such a prodigious output -- Wallace's answer to The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, if you will.

This is the first euro I've seen with alliances and an ingenious scoring mechanic to make sure that you don't get too greedy with your team-mates. It feels like Dominion but with area control and a very well integrated theme, which to me is a crowning achievement. While some may say that Wallace just threw everything in but the kitchen sink, I think the mechanics, even though wildly different, end up meshing together excellently. The only thing that didn't really work for me were the double agent tokens. A real, real shame that it is so expensive now.

Worker placement and hand management game with a hidden role element. Well themed and nice components. Disappointing that I got the most points but didn't win due to the end game scoring condition. You essentially have to rely on your teammates to score well, but not as well as you (and you don't know who they are). I got the most points in the game we played but I didn't win - very frustrating! 

15/8/14 - played a second time and now convinced the game is broken. If players aren't willing to tip their hand then someone can just go for an area majority victory and pump the points. Then it becomes 50:50 on who gets there first and whether you win or not. I tried it first game and lost (cos one of my teammates hadn't yet scored any points) and Tom did it second game and it paid off (he had no idea whether he was going to win or not getting to 22 points and it was just a pure 50:50 shot). May as well roll a dice at the end to see who wins. Downgraded to 3, and I think that is generous. 

Unlikely to ever want to play this again.

Better than I expected. Although to be fair I didn't quite finish my only game. One player hated the game so much that we had to abort. And the rules "evolved" as we played. I'm not a big heavy theme person, and Martin Wallace games have been more miss than hit for me of late, but this was fun. Yeah, people hose you in ways that you can't really do anything about, and players can harass each other that gets both of them nowhere, but you just have to accept that for this kind of game. Unfortunately, we didn't get to vampires or zombies. Which is just as well, because I didn't really understand them anyway. :) But lots of weird rules about stuff like getting points vs potential points, vs potentially getting points. It's all a bit weird. Best explained by someone who knows it cold. But $80? Um, no.

Still figuring this one out. I've enjoyed the dynamics we get between folks who've played before, but every game has had at least 2 first-timers, which seems to throw things off a bit.

Cities are great to close with, but not so great to open with, and the game seems to enter a sort of zero-sum churn if everyone focuses on cities right off the bat. (I've avoided this, but friends have experienced it.)

Wondering how good it is to perform assassinations / hiding counter to actual loyalties to throw others off the track. It seems like it would just result in a different set of people gunning for you, which would sometimes be good and sometimes bad. Hmm.

Can't rate this yet; would be somewhere in the 6-9 range.

Very(!) sandboxy, which makes it sometimes too chaotic to be enjoyable. The shape of the game session seems to be far too dependent on which cards are drawn and available for claiming. Artwork and cards make the game relatively thematic, the mechanics themselves however, not so much. Overally, an interesting game which will not work with every group. Will eventually end up as a quirky grail game a decade from now.

Absolutely NOT recommended for two players, often does not work well with three players either.

Haven't played yet, just trying to learn from the rules.  Sometimes the rules use the term "agent" to include a player's main agent as well as the recruited agents.  Sometimes the rules use the term "agent" and it means only recruited agents, and not a players main agent.  This bugs the shit out of me.  But I'm still going to learn and play this game.  Thank God for BGG.

Update:  Got to play this at Gencon 2014.  When I was reading the rules, it was hard for me to conceptualize how the game played.  There are a lot of different things going on.  There is deckbuilding, there is area control, there are hidden traitors, etc...  I have to say, it all works together really, really well.  I still don't have a clue how to go about deducting what team the others players are on, unless they do something drastic.  Our game mostly saw us just controlling cities and purchasing a few cards.  My first play left me wanting to come back for more.

I could see my 7 rating improving over time.  Right now what is holding it back is the difficulty of teaching this game to new players.

I thought this would be lighter than it is, given that it's based on a 'license' but it's actually rather complex.  The two factions are assymetric and there's a bit of a balancing act in furthering one's position w/o making it blatantly obvious which side you are on.  The game will play differently each time based on the card distribution and the order they come out in each city, however this can lead to one of the game's flaws, which is that a player or faction can be at an extreme disadvantage if the cards required to support their mechanics don't come out.  For example, only one Hide Royalty card came out in our game and it came out maybe two turns before the end of the game, and both of my double agent cards ended up being useless.

If you can get past these flaws though, it's an interesting game that isn't extremely obvious how best should be played.

This is either way too long for the amount of chaos that it throws around, or it's brilliantly clever in juggling subtleties. I'm leaning toward the latter, but will have to play some more to really know for sure.

UPDATE: Second game (2 repeat players and 2 newbies) was much quicker -- almost too quick. But just as fun.

Interesting theme, but middling game play. I'm not sure why your faction is secret, since it's not like you're going to bluff. The cards you can add to your deck seem uninspired. Assassination (or hiding) seems overly difficult as a long term strategy since cards that let you do it are removed after play. Just not impressed.

I'm not sure what to think of this game after 1 play.  I thought it was different enough that it left me wanting to try it again.  But I have some concerns about it as well.  The secret role selection doesn't seem to hold up well.  It becomes pretty obvious what you are very early.  Seems very difficult to accumulate enough bombs to assasinate royals.  A lot of screwage in who gets a city card stolen from.  And often, it becomes a case of "loser-bashing".  You want to make sure you are not in last place (if you are alone on a team) or you want to make sure the other side's trailing player is in last place.  So "beat up on the loser"!!!   An attempt is made to obfuscate this via the secret role victory conditions....but as mentioned, that is transparent.

The agents are good for influence purposes but very fragile due to double-agent tiles.   The permanent effects flip-flop between worthless and game-breaking good.  A lot of unclear scenarios (1st ed).  I want to play it again, but I'm not optimistic the rating will go up.

Last, I learned nothing about emeralds from this game.  It should have been titled "A Study in Influence and Loser Bashing"

This game was okay. It had a lot of exceptions to the rules. There's always causes confusion. Typically people forget about the small exceptions and after a return or to have to go back and correct things it's drags out the game and makes it slightly unbearable. I liked the fact that this was a team game. And some of the art was okay. Although The board did not match whatsoever with the card art which made it slightly odd. I think there are better games out there and I won't be playing this one again.

An interesting thing in this game is the team dynamic. In order to win, you have to score more points than your teammate(s) but your side also has to do better overall than the other side or you lose. The game is cool combination of area control, deck building, and subterfuge. The theme and artwork are awesome too.

This is my rating for Multi-player, I look forward to trying this with 2.  I think it may come in at around an 8 with 2, but my provisional rating stands for now.  Lots of cool stuff going on and I think the art work is fantastic, I was worried that the colors would be off putting but on the table and in person this looks great.  

My 7 rating for multi-player is due to the chaos and potentially swingy nature of the game.

This is such an interesting design that I really wish I could play more. The game itself isn't difficult despite the first play being a little opaque. Once the mechanics fade into the background the above the board interaction gets so interesting as players try to figure out who is on their side. Cards often favoring one side over another makes you wonder if they picked a card to use or to prevent the other side from getting it. That the game forces you into obtaining agents in order to protect yourself from assassination is great. The end game with the elimination of a side is interesting because it makes you question everything and not race too far ahead in points in the event your teammate brings up the rear. I had a game end with the assassination of an agent who ended up winning because the other side was eliminated and he had more points than his teammate. It's that possibility that I find so interesting.

Difficult to rate this game, as my game group en masse has absolutely no interest in it and I've had difficulty getting a good feel for the game over the feel of the players. On the two occasions I've tried to get a game in, players have been actively bored mid-way through, resulting in a hastened wrap-up. I've not agreed with this mood, but nor am I deeply enamored by the mechanisms.

Wow. I finally found someone who had this and he graciously hosted it for 5 players.  This is a game that definitely needs a reprint.  It starts off nice and calm, with everyone bidding on cards, and then it's suddenly a chaotic points grab with lots of position-jockeying.  I can't imagine why this game isn't still in circulation, but it needs to come back to shelves in a hurry.  This is a game everyone should play at least once.

It has everything I enjoy - area control, secret roles, Cthulhu, zombies, vampires, traitors, double-agents, crazy powers, bait n switch, and hell, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a rhinoceros in there somewhere (note: game does not contain rhinoceros).

Enjoyed my first game. Lots of options with cards in hand. With tokens you can take control of cities and cards and add to your deck. Just like a deck building.

Mechanics is interesting. Two teams in game. Don't know who is who at first. 

Understood the game better when it was over. Wasn't sure what I was doing at first or why. Didn't have a game plan in particulier besides getting city cards for points.

Had the most points but lost due to player with least points were on my team.

Update: Note to self: second game was again Restorationist. Use marker to block cards more. If not empty space +2 for Loyalist on the green track.

the world of Sherlock Holmes meets HP Lovecraft ... although it helps to get a tasty background by reading Neil Gaiman's short story .. or indeed Alex Butterworth's 'The World That Never Was' (for wonderful information on the lives of the real personalities that dominate 'A Study In Emerald'.. one need not do so .. though it does make this game all the more interesting .. be loyal to the 'old ones' or spark the anarchist revolution throughout the old world of Victorian times ... this is a journey into madness .. the game-board sucks you into the vortex of paranoidal fear and loathing as the two factions fight for control .. and which side is your neighbour on ?? and who can you trust ?? and do you have any allies ?? .. is the game tilted towards one side, making it more difficult if you are in the other camp .. no doubt .. but it offers a good entertainment value as you become more drawn into the world of Dr Watson v Cthulhu

RATING: 5
This game leaves me confused and befuddled. Maybe that's appropriate for a Cthulhu/Sherlock crossover game. Is this game trying to be a strategic game of skill, or more of an experience game? I'm leaning towards experience, where strategy is less important than seeing how things will work out. Though, I wonder if double agent shenanigans, and killing people's agents will remain entertaining for 10+ plays? I also question whether I'll be able to over come my issues with the kingmaking aspect? It can be highly frustrating when you pretty much know the person in last place is on your team, and there is very little you can do to make them gain VP. I think it's very hard to mask your identity in the game, but maybe that's just my inexperience talking. I just don't really know at this point. I don't even know the ideal player count. On one hand, I like 4 because with 5 it takes a bit to get to your turn, there are less agents on the board, and you can get interesting 3 v 1 situations. On the other hand, the VP threshold for ending the game is smaller. I think that's a good thing, as I think it would reduce the amount of city-swapping before the game ends. In the end, this was too rough around the edges for my liking and I hated that there is very little you could do if your teammate is in last place. I hear there will be a new implementation of this game, but I'm not very hopeful if the team aspect is the same.

Fantastic game in terms of tension, card play, and originality. Itâs a kitchen sink of themes built on a deckbuilding framework with a ton of edge cases and fiddly rules (I should know; I created the FAQ). And somehow it comes off wonderfully. 

The deckbuilding is pointed (or select? we need a word to describe d-b games where the point isnât just adding cards) in that youâre not grabbing lots of cards Dominion-like but rather getting a few particular ones that will shape your action engine this game. The cards are wonderfully varied and come out differently (or not at all) each game such that every game should offer different ways to go about winning as well as tell a different story.

Youâre using your cards to achieve your aims based on the team youâre on. The hook of the game is the way the game is split into secret teams, but only one player wins -- and the player with the lowest score eliminates his entire team. So, you can't just rush out to victory without paying attention to what's going on with the other players. 

The start of the game is informed by the secret roles, but the game is not predicated on them remaining secret. At some point, you have to reveal your intentions via the actions you take, and then the tensions shifts to who can end the game on their terms. It's fascinating that the game can maintain its tension despite the focus shifting mid-game.

This game is like walking on a moving floor in a funhouse. You're trying to keep your balance but make progress all the while laughing at your friends and yourself and hoping you don't sprain a knee. It's an absolutely delicious experience with laughter, slick moves, and cursing.

So I guess this was supposed to be a game about bomb-chucking anarchists in the late 19th century? I'd much rather play that game. There is an interesting core here (deck building with a point!), but all the extraneous layers of supernatural chrome detract from the overall design. I love the short story, I love Martin Wallace's heavier designs, and I wanted to love this. I'll play it again, but this is not long for my collection.

I'm toying with the idea that this may be my favorite Euro of all time. What does ASIE not have? A brilliant theme, incredibly streamlined mechanics, an engaging and surprisingly well done hidden-identity system(especially for a Euro), beautiful components and a bidding system that is just the right level of infuriating. The game somehow manages to make you angry at every other player while still very pleased with the game itself. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys competitive games, thematic Euros, Sherlock Holmes, Lovecraft or Neil Gaiman. 

The only drawback to this game is that it's a bit complex for non-gamers. We did not have much luck introducing it to our D&D friends.

I've only had one proper outing of this game, and a few rules issues may have marred the situation, so I have to give it another go before I finalise this rating.

However, I just didn't get on with it this first session; the design seems very loose, and while it's clear this was intentional, I prefer the tight, challenging designs Wallace used to give us.

It will get at least another play before I decide whether this one is going to be a keeper, or sacrificed to the Great Old Ones.

Update 28NOV13: A definite keeper; we definitely missed a lot of the subtleties first time out, and some have asked to play again. More to follow.

Love this. It's a fantastic game.

What it does well is merge a few different mechanics, area control and deck building, together quite nicely.

The thing it does very well for the right group is the hidden teams and the really interesting scoring mechanic. You have got to not just ensure that you are ahead on the score track but also ensure that no one on your side comes last....except that you can never be 100% sure of who is on what team. It creates a lot of table talk as your all trying to ascertain sides, which may not even be an even split. Be too obvious and you're going to be a target for assassination. We've had a lot of fun playing it."

The theme really makes this game for me. Read the Neil Gaiman short story before you play for added interest. You can read it for free here:

RATING: 6
Changes to a couple of rules would make this game much more enjoyable for me. The double agents were the deal-breaker, as I suspected they would be just from my review of the rule book. The difference between being dealt two DA tiles for agents that come out early in the game, versus receiving tiles for agents that NEVER appear in the game, is substantial. The unearned ability to negate a significant move by an opponent and steal his agent, all as a free action, while that same opponent may not even hold a usable DA tile over the course of the whole game, is far too imbalanced. 

Any mechanic that introduces this degree of chaos needs to be handled with greater care. I probably would have been ok with the DAs if obtaining a tile required some combination of cards and/or actions (say, "Recruit Double Agent"), and in exchange for that opportunity cost you had some assurance that the tile could be useful in some way. 

Unless I were playing a variant, I don't see this ever being a favorable experience for me. Winning because I lucked out on the DA draws wouldn't feel any better then losing for the opposite reason, and waiting for a lousy random outcome that may not actually happen isn't much better. 

As often is the case with Martin Wallace, I find myself thinking, "What a shame. If only he had changed [x]".

Faszination fÃ¼r die phantastische Welt zwischen englischer Mystery-Romantik und spielerischem Horror. Das herausragende Artwork ist eine unwiderstehliche Einladung hinabzutauchen in strange GrÃ¼nde. Dabei geht Wallace den Weg vom absonderlichen Thema zur Spielidee. Das macht Martins typische Mechanismen hier so lebendig. EMERALD hat den Mut zum Anderen. Ein obskures, abgefahrenes und der Geschichte unterworfene Regelwerk mit einem pseudo-semi-kooperativen Aspekt, der das gesamte Team des Punktletzten komplett in die Pfanne haut. Zylinderhut ab vor dieser Courage. Die Studie dieses Spiels mag nicht abgeschlossen und ausbalanciert sein, sie mag Schieflagen haben, aber EMERALD hat die Chuzpe zu einem ein kleinen, genialen wie anfechtbarem Kunstwerk, das sich im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes zwischen spielerischem Wahnsinn und Unsicherheit bewegt und aus dem Gros der Masse leuchtend grÃ¼n hervorsticht.

I played it a second time, and the rules are still a bit too complex. Unlike Dominion where you can achieve something most of the time, it's a bit more frustrating like A Few Acres of Snow where you can often just do rubbish. Our second game ended with one of the alliance of 4 being in last place, causing the sole other player to win. Sorry, that's just random bullshit.

On a third play, I have upped my score to a 7 because we have finally used some rules a second time and it's making a bit more sense. The ending is still random bullshit, but there are some good bits along the way.

A hidden role deck building game.  First, the Sherlock Holmes/Cthulhu theme is cool and the art is beautiful.  The deck building part of the game is very interesting but the hidden role part is bizarre.  This game allegedly plays two but the there are two hidden roles that play differently.  You can tell who's who the minute they score their first point.  If you're playing two players and you're both the same character it's going to be a very short game.  Why have hidden roles in a game where you can instantly tell what someone's role is?  The roles are not balanced, either, with the pro Cthulhu role being much faster to win.

First impressions are great, this is a bonkers game.  Will update with more plays and a more considered view.

FWIW, I would definitely teach the game to a newb using two players, one resto, one loyalist, and removing permanent effects and the double agent chits.  It lays the groundwork of the game mechanics without the kitchen sink or end conditions.  Then you can throw in all the delicious endgame twists.

Interesting mix of mechanics. Deck building/area majority. The real interesting part of this game is the victory conditions and the timing aspect. Essentially you need to be able to end the game when you think you will be the winner. I enjoy the timing and deduction but I'm not as interested in the other parts of the game. Deck building continues to be a mechanic I'm not very interested in.

By far the best and most interesting game I've played. We've played it more than 15 times and we don't have a repeating game experience - each game is unique. It's highly tactical and luck almost plays no role. You have to know how to bluff and read the other players.

This game feels not as "wallace-ish" as others he designed. As it is a (hidden) team based game, the sweet spot is clearly 4 players. 3 players (2 against 1) is unfair, while 5 players is feasible. Restoratists should focus to hurry up because Loyalists have it easier to win the longer the game goes on.

Weird, weird, weird. This always feels slightly "wrong" when you're playing it, but it feels uncannily right by the end. It mechanizes a lot of the gabby social interactions one finds in games like Dune or Cosmic Encounter; one can play silently, and still speak (or bluff) very loudly by laying claim to a certain card, or city. I fear this very unique design will repel more players than it attracts--especially some players here on BGG, who have a strict, binary need to judge games quickly and move on.

Fantastic, beautiful, chaotic game. One of the best games I own, full of intrigue and desperate tactics. The rules are very simple, but they're hard to explain. It all comes together after a few turns, though. The "hidden loyalty" makes the game tense, and the artwork and text make it rich with theme and atmosphere. In fact, this is one of the most thematic games I've ever played, meaning it feels as vivid as a novel, as engaging as a movie. Highly recommended game, and the first Kickstarter game I backed that turned out to be a runaway success. This one's a keeper!

Very good but tough game to win.

Also, every game will be different. Some games will have zombies, others vampires, some both and some none at all! But that's just the monster part, not the player's. With player's actions it is, for certain, that even if we remove the monster mechanics, the games will still be different as this is a strategy covert game where you secretly plot your move. You plot either as a loyalist (insane immortal bad guys) or restorationist (good guys), and it will be your call whether to reveal yourself through your action as one of those or even bluff by supporting the loyalist for a turn or two just to make others believe you are a bad guy (or the other way around, support the good guys when you're a bad guy) so you can have less fear of being assassinated. :D

Really great game! I'm buying this for certain.

Delivers the theme with a vengeance. 

I remember being sceptical after reading the rules and even for the first half hour of our first game. The different mechanisms seemed too disparate, too obscure, and at first noone understood what they were supposed to achieve.

But then understanding kicked in and suddenly the mechanisms klicked together like a tight and well-oiled gear box. And despite the rough start, that very first game turned into an incredibly thematic, super tense and heated struggle for world domination in the Lovecraftian 1880s. 

Needless to say that raising Cthulhu in order to devastate Vienna, thereby preventing my opponent from scoring the city and winning the game was the amazing climax of the game. Just WOW!

Fantastic use of theme, mechanically its strange to say the least. At its core its an area control deck building game with a hidden team element. If you can find it buy it. Don't think the 2nd edition will capture the strangeness in the same way. To simplify and streamline this game is to kill what makes it so great.

Oh, Wallace. Over-complicated, not terribly well-balanced, and far too overwrought for its own good. At least he figured out that trashing is powerful; this time, however, he built a deckbuilder where your initial deck is better than the vast majority of cards on offer.

A complex deck builder that meshes Sherlock Holmes' deduction with late 19th Century anarchist bombings in a Lovcraftian Cthulhu Mythos setting.  Have only played 2 player, and use birchbeer's "Agent Sunday 2 Player Variant" to retain the Loyalist vs Restorationist mechanic.  The game is complex and takes quite awhile to understand, but overall is worth the effort.  Not played often, but enjoyable when we do.

Interesting mix of game mechanism but nothing really new from this game. The game board looks boring and my opinion haven't changed about it yet. I like hidden role games, while you are trying to figure out your enemies role you are also seeking for possible allies. I feel odd to win with "Restorationist" while i gone mad. It is much easier to win bids for more points on the cities instead of using bombs. It might be my problem, but i think it is a bit unbalanced game that im not really fond of. I took around 1,5 hours to play, but felt like 2,5.

Pros / Cons:
-Great mix of mechanics.
-Hidden roles gives some interesting staff goes on.

-The board looks boring, while the game is also boring as well.
-Expensive.

Martin Wallace does deck building - last time I thought that was a good idea I bought A Few Acres of Snow which I find to be one of the biggest disappointments I own.

That said I'd be keen to look at this and possibly even get it. With the light weight and the Cthulu fluff I could possibly even play this down at the geek munch or boardgame munch... get them knowing the name Martin Wallace and I'm halfway towards London!!!

Played it. This is actually a pretty good game. Semi co-op BSG-esque with 2 teams.

It's short and doesn't outstay it's welcome but apparently the first edition is much longer and I'd be keen to try it too

(01/12/2014) Comment based on one play.

This is a wonderful and rather sophisticated evolution of the deck-building-tied-to-a-board concept introduced by Martin Wallace in A Few Acres of Snow and London.

The game has a number of conflicting feels, such as the temporary and initially unknown affiliations of each player, similar to the tug-of-war of the two factions in Princes of Machu Picchu. However, affiliations are dealt out like the traitor cards in Shadows Over Camelot, potentially dividing the players into either Restorationists or Loyalists. Play is relatively quick, with each player taking only two actions, but from a list similar to AFAoS, so it feels like SOC in that regard. Players start only knowing of their affiliation, but not of the others, and must figure that out during the course of the game. There are a number of victory conditions, with some based on the relative success of the Restorationists and Loyalists, and the actual VP count is relatively fluid until the end game. Also, the players in a given faction must each have higher VPs, compared to the player VPs in the other faction, in order for their faction to win. Then, whomever has the highest VP within the faction wins. The complex VP rules feel similar to Knizia's rules for Tigris and Euphrates, or Samurai, or even Archipelago. There is an area-control/influence aspect on the board, with players dropping influence cubes on cities, or cards, much like in Perikles.

Players start with a basic deck of ten agent cards, each with symbols for various influence cubes, gold, bombs, and possible action text. Like Dominion, players deal out a hand of five, and play cards from that hand, and refilling to five at the end of the turn. Discards count as an action. On a play, gold can be played to buy new influence cubes into the player's stock, or to move agents around on the board. Cards with the cube symbol can be played to place cubes from stock onto the board, or other allocations. More powerful cards can be "bought" from the 12 cities on the board, by placing influence on them and maintaining majority. The same goes for cities. New cards are placed into the discard, and eventually appear in a player's hand. These new cards give more cube, gold, and bomb symbols, along with the ability to increase/decrease the relative success of the Restorationists or Loyalists, and more powerful action texts. Bomb symbols can be played to assassinate agents or "royals" on the board. Agents are pawns that are necessary to conduct assassinations, as well as boost up influence for cities and/or cards. Royals can be assassinated for VP. Cities can be claimed for VP.

The main source of VPs is from assassinating royals and claiming cities, but both have interesting constraints. Cities are easier to claim, by simply plopping down enough influence to gain a majority. However, on later turns, another player can take over the city and the corresponding card, with a zero-sum game in terms of VP--the new player gets the VP, while the former owner loses the same amount of VP. Assassinating royals is much easier, once players have accumulated cards that have bomb symbols and cards with special action text. However, there is a 2 out of 3 chance the agent that attempted the assassination could go "mad", thus removing the agent from the game. If a player accumulates three mad tiles AND is a Restorationist, the game will end abruptly, so assassinations are constrained as well.

There are simply too many rules and exceptions to document here. Needless to say, the rules explanation took over an hour, with the first few turns taking awhile. Turns became progressively quicker, as the players became familiar with the actions, as well as the numerous card text, which is sort of like London--it takes awhile to get to see all of the cards and see how they interact, so this may take several plays to really "get it". Because of the various victory conditions, the game could drag out, or end abruptly due to one of the exceptions. In a longer game, the Loyalists seem to have an advantage, so the Restorationists must act quickly to get lots of VP to push to a quick game end. However, due to the unknown alignments of each player, this will slow down both factions accordingly.

The components are very good quality, similar to London, or any other Treefrog offering. The rules printout is similar in look and feel to Brass, London, and A Few Acres of Snow. There is one minor quibble, as there is plenty of 8 pt fonts on literally everything in the game, making it difficult to read from across the table.

This is a fascinating game, with many, many intricate layers and interlocking pieces, that it will take more than several games to fully understand. The mechanisms are straightforward, but it is not immediately apparent on how to go about achieving victory. An interesting, challenging game that is worth exploring. As for theme, the Lovecraft/Cthulhu/Sherlock Holmes/vampires/zombies theme was initially a turnoff, but this is much better than Arkham Horror in terms of gameplay AND theme. The story emerges from the open-ended, sandbox nature of the game--totally chaotic, random, and non-linear. There seems to be as much chaos in this game, as in a game of Cosmic Encounters, but for some reason feels comfortably constrained here. Still, the randomness and various "take that" actions in the game may alienate some. For now, I rating this a solid "8".

(01/24/2014) Update after 5 plays. This has the intensity of Hansa Teutonica, where both games feel like "knife fights in a phone booth" kind of thing. It is not uncommon for two players to get into "pissing contests" where they fight over a card or city, with both players dumping in more influence cubes (and wasting actions) to one-up the other. This is not recommended in the first turn or two, as the wasted actions and stagnant cubes mean your deck is not improving. Some in my group have soured on this aspect; others not so much. We've played it enough to see a variety of game ending conditions, each one unique and unexpected. Also, we've experienced short games at 60 minutes and long games clocking in at 2.5 hours. An interesting, dynamic game that we're still enjoying exploring.

Firstly, such a gorgeous game with some really characterful artwork. Secondly, what a cool theme it has; how can you not love Sherlock with Cthulhu and zombies and vampires and assassinations and double agents? Thirdly, it's a really neat mixture of mechanics: social deduction/hidden roles, deck-building, territory control, bidding...

Finally, heaps of replayability and on-the-fly tactics. No playthrough will ever be the same, and much of it seems very tightly balanced.

Uhh... this is really weird, and has a ton of things crammed into one game. And in a way, that's kind of okay, because with this theme I can even forgive it for saying "well, and there were probably zombies too somewhere because why not."  The rules are confusing and you don't really know what's going on, but it's still possible to adopt a course of action which you hope will be effective.  Honestly, the jury is still out, but I want to play it again and I'm hoping that I'll find an interesting and rich game in there.  Or maybe it's just a fiddly mess, but at least it is somewhat entertaining. (1 play)

RATING: 4
7 -> 4

UPDATE: Unfortunately the second time through was not an improvement.  Instead of emphasizing the things I liked about the game (which I had hoped for), the second play ony emphasized the things I didn't like the first time.  Even with a definite focus (which I lacked the first time around), the difficulty of doing any game advancing actions (assassinations, moving around the board) drags down the thematic aspects of the game, so instead of feeling like I'm in a hot bed of alt-19th century intrigue I feel like I'm drawing cards, placing cubes, and hoping for the best.  And the whole City Card mechanic really just sunk the game, as people kept fighting back and forth over cities to keep anyone from getting past the game-ending score.  There seems to be something of a consensus that the game improves with experienced players, but the realities of my gaming life basically guarantee that will never happen, so off it goes.

Original Review:
Definitely a provisional rating. I feel like it's practically impossible to accurately assess a game this dense and layered after only one go around - it took about 3/4 of the way through the game before I had an inkling of what strategy I should have been pursuing.  However, I can definitely see the potential in Emerald - though the game does have healthy doses of madness (har har) and mayhem, players must be surprisingly focused to accomplish their objectives.  Cards on the board are just as likely to be expensive distractions as helpful tools, and it's easy to get carried away going after all the shiny objects.  Most of the important things to accomplish in the game are very expensive and difficult to pull off (with the exception of the City cards, which derailed the flow of the game for a good 15-20 minutes and are probably my least favorite aspect of the game), so not getting sidetracked by all the moving parts is looking to be a key element of strong gameplay (an element also present in one of my very favorite games, Dominant Species).  The theme, which initially turned me off, actually fits the craziness of the gameplay fairly well (helped along by seriously amazing card artwork, though the board is still too busy for my tastes) and I grew to appreciate the inclusion of all the Cthulu chrome.  Looking forward to playing again soon.

Very complex game insofar as it can play many different ways.  The greatest difficulty for all players is the team elimination of whom ever is the lowest scoring member.  It is a grinding area control with brutal fist fights over every point that can be gained (a real problem is see-sawing territories that seems to drag on a great deal and may be the feature that limits replay with an otherwise fantastic game).  Funny enough, the restorationists are willing to kill each other or themselves to end the game if they are winning on points.  Needs further play to properly evaluate.

Tons of theme through this game - which is good.

Entering the first play, I felt like it was a deck-builder with a area control mechanic to acquire cards (and ultimately VP) alone with a hidden role aspect (like Shadow Hunters).  However, I believe that the hidden role aspect is the strongest aspect of the game - which I do enjoy, just not what I expected.  The deck building aspect felt rather weak, as you it's hard to acquire too many cards, and you don't cycle your deck too many times to see cards a lot.

Would give this another play.

RATING: 9.5
The Cthulhu theme is what jumps out at you . . . and the Sherlock Holmes . . . and I love them both! But IMO this game is a masterpiece because of how well it conveys the feel of espionage/being a secret agent. When playing, you donât trust anyone, and you donât want even those on âyour sideâ (if you could even be sure they really were on your side) to figure out what youâre going to do next. I hope that more games use this game's novel base premise that players are on teams, but only sort of, and only player can win. 

I *love* this game and think it is one of the most interesting games to come out in years -- but I rate it slightly less than 10 because it's a bear to teach and usually takes folks more than one play to really appreciate it. (Only by our third game did we manage to get all the rules right.) But in this case the complicated/fiddly rules are very much worth the effort. Reviewer Rahdo called it "sloppy, messy, and gorgeous," and I think that is a great description.

RATING: 6
1 play.

First thoughts:
- multiplayer tug-of-war - the main problem with the game
- you cannot NOT to reveal your secret faction by playing for your faction.  There are no sneaky, tricky, non-obivious moves which can mislead your opponents as to your true identity :(
- no hard choices, many moves are evident and repetitive.  Thus you feel downtime.  Esp. when you planned your 2 actions and see that there are STILL 3 opponents to act before your turn :-/

All in all: the theme (or rather the compound of themes) is - sadly - wasted...

I will gladly play once more to verify my statements, but - in the meantime - I returned the game to the shop in shrink...

Secret identity games are some I enjoy usually, will want to test first Martin is very hit or miss for me.

Hmmm read some more about it, it REALLY sounds up my alley and possibly downright evil but the price tag to Canada (currency conversion), OUCH. Damn shame. (I admire the shipping policy used on the one hand, but damn English pounds as the currency REALLY jacks up the price. Fine for English folk, terrible for many others)

---------

Oh I am so excited [sarcasm], why don't I put an "anticipation rating" up, since BGG foolishly allows people to do such a thing with no warning about it, great trend going there to make sure ratings become more and more useless. 

--------

Oh, another great trend going to, why don't I add a near useless picture to the comment section instead of the picture gallery, to try and make sure my 'valuable' comments get noticed over other people's, since I guess they are not good enough on their own...  :yuk:

To quote someone else, I've enjoyed all my plays of Study In Emerald, but I'm not sure whether it's any good as a game. It is clunky and filled with special-cases and has an awkward end/victory condition that lends itself to half the table piling on one player, but it's also super-thematic and somehow just a lot of fun. I'm rating it a seven because I don't know what else to rate it.

One of the better Wallace games I've played recently.  While there aren't that many basic actions, there are a ton of moving parts and trying to decipher what others are doing is crucial.  I really like the scoring mechanic of needing to "work on" the lowest player - either helping if on your team or nailing him if on the other one.  I suspect other plays will be 100% different based on the cards that come out.  It's chaotic....but that's a good thing.

Can you manage chaos, limited-information and a lot of player interaction? If so, there's a good chance you'll like this fun and unique game.

This game is about breadth, though there is depth as well.  I've played four times, and still haven't seen zombies (yes, there's zombies and elder gods).  There are also vampires, anarchists, Sherlock Holmes, Moriarty, and all sorts of other wild and crazy things.  This is a gamer's game.  Although the strategy is fairly approachable for newer gamers, the sheer number of options can induce analysis paralysis.  Each turn is relatively small in terms of progress towards ending the game, so slow play can really bog the game down.  It's also a bit of a bear to teach because although vampires, zombies, and elder gods may or may not show up, knowing about them can be important.  On the other hand, it is possible to play as more of a storytelling experience and not worry too much about min-maxing.  Personally, I tend to do a bit of both.  See you in the Diogenes Club!

Now this is the Martin Wallace that I have come to love. Wonderfully quirky in both approach and design, and very playable. Many of his designs lately have been a little weak in the design department, but this certainly bucks the trend. While I think Wallace has grown a bit TOO fond of the deckbuilding mechanic the last few years, here he uses it to the best effect yet. 

The game mashes up Lovecraft, Doyle, real history, zombies and vampires. Players play as part of a secret team of Loyalists or Restorationists trying to subvert the aims of the other team. When you figure out who is on your team, you want to help make sure no one on your team is the lowest scorer, or nobody on that team can win.

I don't quite understand the "bashing the leader" statements about this game. You need to decide whether to bash the leader ON YOUR TEAM, bash the poor sod ON THE OTHER TEAM struggling to make points, or to boost your own potential.

The board is a fabulous piece of hand-drawn art and is worth a call out by itself.

The core of the game, which is this semi-coop mix where you're supposed to help the weaker members of your team, is obfuscated by overly complex secondary mechanics which do nothing but add chaos to the game. As a result, it is almost impossible to bluff or cooperate convincingly and instead just play the game as a regular area control game.

My dislike for Wallace games only intensifies with each new game I try.

Mechanically many good and classic Wallace elements are included like area-influence control, card drafting and sudden death ending conditions. However, there are also some quite negative design choices like possibility for stacking contests, super boring multiplayer influence tug of wars and deck building with relatively weak cards to add to your deck. In addition the aforementioned tug of war around the city control is a really meaningful way to gain points and is therefore of high attention all the time and is this game is atypically for Wallace a totally crappy use of the theme at hand.

Wonderful game, but a bit difficult to learn.
The theme is great and used to very good effect. Expect every game to be different, and rethink your strategy accordingly!
Plays best with four people.

Looking forward to get the second edition that sorted out all the fiddly and unclear rules, in favor of a more streamlined but equally deep experience.

RATING: 7
The board is a big contested drafting area offering cards and points. The cards go into the low-intensity deckbuilding element, improving drafting efficiency or enabling ways of getting points that cannot be taken away in the draft. Overall I found the game rather mysterious and pleasant. Concerns include whether the endgame will always tend towards prolonged bashing the current leader (with an added team-based complication), and whether the hidden roles will ever stay hidden long enough for their hiddenness to matter.

I really wanted to like this, as the theme is great and there are certain interesting mechanics (such as the secret teams), but the game is too clumsy. There are too many separate mechanics and exceptions, plus the double agent mechanic makes it pretty much impossible to build a strategy. With a coherent and streamlined ruleset, this would have potential to be very good.

Played this one once and I can't say that I was too enamored with it. I really like the end-game scenario and I think the deckbuilding is simple enough to transition people that aren't familiar with the mechanic. I like the theme and I think I want to try it again before I jump into 2nd ed.

Way too long for what it offers. You start out by thinking "hey, this team mechanism where you can't win if somebody on your team loses the game is pretty cool" but soon go to "oh god this thing drags since I can't end the game because a player who might be on my team is losing". Other than that A Study in Emerald could've used a bit of streamlining, seems like a mechanism or two too many were crammed in the game.

Opening at a somewhat disappointing 7. The game is an absolute bear to teach, and the presentation is a major obstacle to learning and acquiring skill. It has the potential to go much higher if it can overcome those barriers.

RATING: 6
Chaos in a box.  Left me feeling the same as after playing Flux.  Triple blind gameplay, unpredictable & fickle, dripping with theme and Cthulhu awesomeness.  I suspect this will be a fairly polarizing game.  You certainly need to enjoy the process of the play and the narrative, and not care too much about "winning" to deeply enjoy this game.  Don't get this hoping for a Mythos themed dominion or Few Acres of Snow, as nothing could be further despite the deck building mechanic.  With Lovecraft being as popular as he is, building good groups to play this is possible, but you really need to enjoy the theme, otherwise it's a very questionable proposition.

RATING: 9
Be aware:  Lots of people have played their games incorrect b/c the rules are not intuitive nor are they well written.  But, if you stick it out with all the rules, nuances and updated FAQs, or if taught by an experienced teacher, this game totally rocks!  It's best for 4 to 5 players who like hidden role games.

It's a semi-cooperative, with hidden roles (two teams: loyalists versus restorationists) area-influence, deck-building board game that includes four possible ways to trigger the end of the game.  The biggest end game rub is that You cannot win if a player on your "team" is in last position after final scoring (so, do you want to help that person?).  Do you even know who that person is? 

This game is based upon Neil Gaiman's Hugo Award Winning Short Story!  It's H.P. Lovecraft meets Sir Arthur Conan Doyle!  

The zombie pieces are sweet, and the Sherlock Holmes + Cthulhu theme is extremely cool!  There can be vampires too as powerful agents like Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty.  

This is an experiential game with lots of controlled chaos to enjoy.  It's rich in theme and madness.  If you don't like that kind of stuff, you probably will not enjoy this game.

One of the obvious layers to score is the VP track is to control cities (and city cards).  Also, don't forget that exhausting a stack of cards on each city effectively moves two up on the War Track for the Loyalists.  

I already love there are so many options for each player's turn and there are sufficient things to pursue for victory, even if you are outnumbered (3 versus 2, or even 3 versus 1).  Also, if there are 3 team members on one side, it also means they have an extra player to be concerned about in landing for last place (thus, that team is ineligible to win).  In four players, it's possible that it's 3 versus 1, and therefore, the team of 1 just has to be sure it's not in last place in order to gain victory against the team of 3.  I find that supremely interesting!  Especially with four possible ways in which the game could end immediately.  

Each game is different, your hidden roles and available card options vary game to game, and there is lots of hidden versus confrontation interactions!  The biggest key is trying to determine who is on your team and who is against you!  Bluffing by experienced players turns things into a whirlwind of second guessing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While slightly fiddly with a few rule exceptions as is typical of Wallace, this game is actually relatively straightforward to play mechanically.  Choose two actions of 8 choices or so.  

The trick/intrigue in this one is the temporary alliances caused by the rule that if the person with the high score has someone on their "team" that has the low score, that high score does not count.  Hence, there can be quite a bit of messing around and/or assisting each other in various ways.  

The different cards provide some interesting flavor/theme and provide some other challenges as well.

RATING: 6
Very "swingy" and a bit too long for what it is IMHO.  I love the theme and mechanics (area control, bidding, engine building).  It suffers from "gang up on the leader" mentality and as a result the game can swing quite dramatically which is both frustrating and intense at the same time.

The secret roles mechanic does not work in this game.  The only thing it does is drag out the length of the game because if someone on your team is in last place you CAN'T win the game. So if someone who is potentially on your team is in last place it is a huge risk to end the game even if you have enough victory points.  This causes the game to drag big time as people gang up on the leader and everyone is reluctant to end the game.

I would say this is an 'OK' game.  I would play it again if the group really wanted to play it but most likely won't be requesting to play it.

[thing=141517][/thing] is a messy game.  A player can be an agent of the Great Old Ones or a revolutionary trying to rid the world of them.  Being one or the other means little differences in the rules and the victory conditions making things a bit of a mess.  And because keeping your loyalty a secret is usually beneficial, it can get messy when trying to explain things mid-game to a newbie.  Nevertheless, once players get the game, it can be a tense, exciting affair where the only mess is what's left after using the Infernal Machine on one of your opponent's agents making [thing=141517][/thing] my runner up of 2014.

For the original first edition from KS. Yes, it's hard to get your head wrapped around this game at first. And yes, there are non-Cuthulu elements mixed in for some reason. And yes, there is card drafting, which I normally dislike. But I LOVE this game. Dripping with theme, tension out the wazoo, dynamic gameplay built in to the mechanism, back and forth, screwage....wow. This game is an amazing feat of game design.

I'm concerned about the second edition, but I'll hope for the best.

Managed to snag a copy for about the original retail cost, June 2015.

RATING: 5
2/2014 Deck building game in a SherlockHolmes/CthulhuMythos world.  There's a lot going on here; basically you'll have to select a strategy within the first few rounds and then stick to it, of course adapting somewhat depending on what other players are doing.

There are two factions within the game, one of which you're supporting. Keep a look-out for and help others who are supporting your faction as you're not better than the weakest player within one faction.

We're always suckers for anything Cthulhu, and this game provides a good theme tack-on.  Only, what's with the vampires and zombies?!??! I'm guessing they are left-overs from another game and just thrown in as a Kickstarter bonus.

3/2014 Ok, so a second attempt with some strategy and planning. Even with the simplest plan - a two-card combo - it's still pot-luck if you'll achieve your goal within several rounds.  Game progress where one have actual influence feels very limited; it feels more like the game is pulling you along.  Rating down 7 -> 5.

RATING: 7
The game has some potential, even with the horrid components. The mechanics of A Few Acres Of Snow are quite obvious, the semi-cooperative aspect of the game is interesting, but like many Walace games, it's quite fiddly. The game would require many plays for understanding it entirely and I'm not sure I'd be willing to play much more than one or two more.

RATING: 3
[Played once]

Deckbuilding with no purpose (your starting deck is already close to optimal and more easily worsened than improved by adding the available extra cards).

Secret partnerships that do not work (it'll be revealed too soon and there's no real incentive to keep it secret; additionally, you may play well, but if your teammates don't, you'll still lose).
It obviously does not work at all with only 2 players.

Abundant "bash the leader" as the main interaction.

It tries hard to convey its (weird) theme, but it just feels like a bland management exerice (as it is).

Typical (for Wallace's games) messy rulebook.

Wow, what a game. Very original. There is a cooperative aspect in it (you are either a monster or human, and destiny of players of same sort affect each other), but you all play to win the game. Very original end scoring. 

In the beginning it's hard to understand what you are doing, but after a few turns, that changes. What stays is a very original gameplay where alliances, and misleading each other is part of the game. 

Need to try this a second time. A pity that the graphics are so over the top.

Fun Wallace game with a great theme. It is a little chaotic, but that's what makes it so much fun.  There is a lot of direct player interaction and attacking, however you may be killing a guy on your team, and if he scores lowest his team can not win. 

Certainly depends on the crowd, but lucky for me I play with guys who like to have fun and not a bunch of min-maxing eurogamers. 

Almost experiential in nature, certainly don't care If i win this one, the ride is fun.

RATING: 8.5
A Study in Emerald is a textbook example of why you don't buy games that don't scale well. In this case, this game, I would argue, is unplayable with 2. Certainly, if you play with 2, you won't be getting the full effect. What's more, it devolves into a tit-for-tat struggle for control of cities (which incidentally only comprises a small portion of the game). In this way, the game is downright broken with 2. I don't recommend trying it at that level, even for practice. That said, I do like the game. There's a lot of cool mechanisms involved. The art is gorgeous. The production is quite good and the theme is fresh (albeit strange). I like the "idea" of the game so much that I'm considering holding onto it for a few years just to see it I can get 4-5 to play it. Although I have not played it with 3, I don't think it would be good at that level either. So, even if you use the Agent Sunday variant on BGG, I don't think the game is going to live up to its full potential. The end-game scoring conditions really distinguish this game and without their implementation, I don't think it's going to be anything special. All in all, terrible for 2, but could be magnificent with 4-5 (if they are gamers). In other words, this is a niche game that should only appeal to a very select crowd with an established group. 

Rating is based on expected gameplay with 4-5.

Update: 3 days later.....I can't stop thinking about this game!

Enjoyable game.  A decent amount of rules overhead to overcome initially, but a great mind twister trying to figure out who is on your team, how to make sure that the lowest scoring player isn't on your team, and to fight off your rivals (former comrades).  Great theme, although I found the board a bit busy.

So much going on in this game, and it needs a decent rules refresher each time. Key is that you want to figure out which teams others are on, but not obviously reveal your identity, to keep them guessing, and also to build up sufficient points that you are either in the lead or within striking distance of the lead.

In terms of how to execute this, it comes down to building the deck, optimising position and not giving too much away. Alternatively, one option could be to find a way to grab unstealable points (eg assassinating royalty so that you don't become a target for city stealing). 

Happy to keep exploring this game. Plays very well with 5.

Cautiously optimistic.  Wasn't interested in any of Wallace's 2012 games.

This game is enjoyable.  It can feel chaotic, but it doesn't play long.  I'm not sure how I feel about the "team" mechanic (i.e. win as an individual, but lose as a team, if the lowest scoring player is on your team).

I will play this, but I'm not sure I need to own this one.

Doesn't seem that it would work well with only 2 players.

Rating after one play, reflecting my buzz from the game. Super chaotic, with lots that can (and might not) happen. Similarly to Pax Porfiriana, not all cards are used every game, so lots of randomness. Very difficult strategy, it seems to me - will likely require a number of playings before I can gain a footing. I think the theme is quite well integrated, which is something I love about it. Art is always a matter of taste, but I love both the board and card art. The only downsides I can see is that it plays better with more people (I expect 4-5 is best), the game is quite expensive, and the gameplay, while in the macro sense is straightforward, has some rules that are a little loose in actual play. (I think in a somewhat complex game like this there are always going to be a few 'judgement calls' on some rules, but there are more in this game than one would like to see)

I'm still undecided on what I think about the game. I think it is definitely the best Cthulhu game that I've played. The theme integration is so much better than any of the FFG games. There are a lot of little fiddly rules that tend to come along with a Martin Wallace game of this style, but I didn't come across any that didn't make sense with respect to the subject.

I found the hidden roles to be interesting in that they have asymmetric goals, but I'm not sure what the benefits are for being completely secret. The only real risk that I can think of is that as a resistance member, you don't want to be known because that makes your main agent more vulnerable to be killed off since that ends the game. I thought the way only one side scores at the end of the game to be pretty interesting as well. 

In the end, my first impressions of the game is that it may be more chaotic than I'd like it to be. I never felt like I had a lot of control over my own destiny.

A very interesting mixture of mechanics, but at the end of the day just too chaotic for me. The game can end quite abruptly (e.g. on the first turn). A player who has a clear lead can lose the game because of his team mate (known or unknown) performing poorly (or just under attack). Perhaps this is more of an experience game than a strategy game, but that just reinforces my position: not for me.

RATING: 7
A simple and solid core of deck building with bidding and a spatial element made delightfully weird by the team victory condition and the various game ending conditions, along with the wacky deviant strategies afforded by certain rare cards. 

The team victory condition leads to some interesting and unusual play. For example, if you pull far ahead the opposing team will focus their efforts in beating down your teammate, rather than you (assuming everyone has made their role mostly clear). Your teammate, on the other hand, will avoid taking points (which would allow you to end the game) and focus on pulling you down.

There are certain cards that are "fun" but the best cards tend to be more mundane economy upgrades. 

I think it's a game that's easily ruined by one or two players playing badly.

First play reveals a game that shares a lot of mechanisms with Stuggle of Empires (influence geographic areas, move armies/agents between them to do stuff, improve what you are able to do via buying chits/cards, shifting alliances, etc).

A wonderful mess of a game. Many mechanisms and details thrown together and it really works. You have hidden factions and it is reminiscent of Pax Profiriana in that you have to find a way to set yourself up to win, then end the game before that window is slammed shut.

Difficult to play well (for myself at least). Really fascinating.

Really a big, sandbox-y mess of mechanisms that make for a mess of a game. A wonderful mess. Players have to balance the game, they have to keep each other in check. They have to challenge each other for powerful cards. They have to watch the actions of their opponents to try to deduce their allegiances.

Detailed player aids are a must.

The game is very much in the secret teams. They help portray the idea of a secret war. Of particular interest is the 3-1 setting, where the lone player is guaranteed a victory, if he's not last. But is it 3-1, or 2-2? If the theme does nothing to you, the game is not going to impress.

Indifferent.

This one is a very peculiar game due to how the winner is found... There are 2 teams but no one knows what team the other players are on, and when the End of the Game is triggered all the scores are tallied up and all players on the team of the player with the fewest points is lose, even if they have the most victory points, they can't win... 
The winner will be the player of the other team that has more points.

This is a pretty unique way to see who wins the game.

But it also is the focal point of my biggest issue with the game, no, I don't have a problem with that, the problem comes from players trying to prevent others from triggering the end of the game because they suspect (or know) that the player in last place is on their team... this makes the game drag for quite sometime and overstay it's welcome...

The other things about the game I really like, the art, the theme, the powers, the bluff and the second guessing... all very well implemented.

It's here - now to play it!

Update:

I organised a ten pack Kickstarter pledge for this game and only recently have the stars aligned to allow me to actually get it to the table. A key factor in playing was that one of the regular attendees of and ACT gaming group, Gungahlin Library Open Games (GLOG), offered to run a learning game for anyone who was interested; the four available places filled up pretty quickly.

We got two games in. The first was ended quickly when one player accidentally triggered game end by killing off the last agent of the Restorationists. This provided a great object lesson in how scoring works (all members of the faction with player with the least points lose, regardless of their own personal tally) as the winning Loyalist had a mere eight points. The next game ran to its full course until a Loyalist triggered game end by voluntarily revealing and getting enough victory points to end (and win) the game. Both games were great experiences and thoroughly involving and enjoyable.

I really enjoyed both plays of the game, I like the asymmetrical nature of the game, the options around the way information is revealed/concealed/managed as well as the scoring system and gameplay all which seems to offer a lot of replayability. In fact, I think it would take another half dozen games to really get to the point of basic competence and understanding of all the possibilities contained within A Study in Emerald. Furthermore, the components are top-notch (note that the replacement pieces are available for the couple of misprinted agents) and the weird pink-green colouring of the board perfectly complements the theme. 

So, despite a fairly lacklustre Kickstarter campaign characterised by poor communications from the creator the end product is actually very good. Iâm not sure how often Iâll get this to the table as the complexities of the game probably wonât appeal to many of the more casual gamers I know, but it is a definite keeper and one I am confident that will continue to deliver a top-notch gaming experience for a long time to come.

The final vote of confidence comes from the one player who did not then own the game â after the second play he was so impressed that he literally (that is, this is what he actually did) rushed out the door to get to the local games store to secure one of the few copies still left on the shelves.

Any game that has even the most obscure, tenuous allusion to GK Chesterton has my undying love and devotion. It is the crazy confluence of two totally disparate worlds!

Edit: played again the other night. I like it more each time I play it. And did I say it alludes to GKC? Crazy good game. Dense to explain the rules to noobs, but well worth it.

Also, did I mention that GKC, while not IN the game, hovers OVER it! Beyond cool.

GKC...  :)

Aw, what the heck, I am giving it a 10! Call it the "GKC effect". Plus the game deserves it.

When I first started playing ASiE and hadn't figured it out, it was a 6.5. Too chaotic, too bizarre, too fragile a design to be rated any higher.

Wow, what a strange mash-up of Sherlock, Cthullu and Zombies!
This game is an immersive experience with the theme being strong. I like the idea that the side with the lowest scoring player cannot win - very clever, as you need to ensure that you are not on that side when the game ends.
After one play, I am keen to play again.
After second play, I am still not completely sure what I am doing every move, but the game is a great "experience".

Only 1 play.  I'm pretty sure this is a better game than the 7.5 rating after my initial play.  But it will appeal more to those who are into this theme, which I am not.

A Study In Emerald is a Cthulhu/Sherlock hidden-teams 'live deck building' and auctioning hybrid game that feels like a twisted fantasy adventure version of Shadowhunters. It gets better with every play. The deck building mechanic is almost identical to that of Mage Knight the board game. There is a huge amount of variability in terms of which cards appear and in what order, giving wildly different aims and concerns with each play. It is essentially a fast and furious free-form sandbox with many options but very little downtime. The thematic feel of paranoia, madness and uncertainty permeate both the art and the mechanics. This is enforced by the clever idea that the team with the lowest ranking player is eliminated, gifting the win to the highest scoring member of the opposite team. The theme also invokes hilarity and mayhem, for example, winning by getting mad or dying at the right moment. There are ample opportunities to stab other players in the back or to block their investment. Setting up is fast, especially if one invests in a small plano box. There is surprising elegance in the minimalism of components. The rulebook is a badly formatted reference guide (bgg forum browsing is essential to learn the game). This game has surpassed Mage Knight board game as my favourite game of all time. The game is not at its best with two players, but even this version of the game would rank in my all-time top 3. It's just ridiculously fun as a combos-oriented game: as with Mage Knight, you feel a lot of satisfaction for pulling off the right combos, acquiring the right cards and playing them at the right time -- it feels like chaining attacks into a fluid acrobatic dance. The more I play it, the more convinced I am of the huge amount of work and passion put into the design, to make it balanced and logical in hundreds of different emergent scenarios. What an achievement! This, my friends, is the absolute peak of triumphant board game design.

Best game I've ever played. Amazing chaos with mechanics that work well, leaving a lot of room for freedom and yet not creating a broken game. Martin Wallace, you've once again created a masterpiece.

EDIT [10->9]: After some time and plays of other, tidier designs, I decreased the score by one - simply because while this game often does not work too well as a result of the players' attitudes, many other I've played do.

EDIT2 [9->7]: It's pretty hard to get it played, plus the 2nd edition looks much tidier. I think that this game excels at blending the mechanisms with theme, while not really delivering a good game - in the sense that though the game may deliver a great time once in many sessions, usually it is just 'meh' preceded by extremely long explanation..

My absolute favourite! So much fun, so many possibilities, perfect theme. Despite some flaws and extensive FAQs, the game is so enthralling it rises above such complaints. 

Second edition has been released which offers a similar experience despite undergoing considerable changes. More accessible, physically and playing the game. Suitable for those who found the first edition too much for their liking, whether price or complexity!

So many different game mechanics in one game.
It's an area control, hidden roles card game deck builder. 

The game is based on the short story with the same name written by Neil Gaiman (which I love).

The artwork is superb and the game is fun to play. The downside with the game is that there is way too much to do in the game and it can get really fiddly and sometimes confusing.

Otherwise it's a good game.

The game features very clever ideas and a crafty combination of mechanics to create a really unique game.

Things I like:
Â·) The theme and the art that comes with it.
Â·) The game idea and the combination of mechanics.
Â·) No snowball effect at all!
Â·) It's not possible to build a superdeck. All the decks will be more or less the same.

Things I don't like: 
Â·) Many "small" rules, "a la Wallace".
Â·) Uncontrollable: the actions of the rest of the players will define your outcome more than your own actions.
Â·) I did not see any way of winning that do not imply other players allowing it. The game can stall (my first game did, it lasted 4 hours).
Â·) I love the idea of hiding your allegiance, but it's not really feasible for a long time.
Â·) I have the impression that moving the cubes and controlling cities is the game winning strategy. The rest of the things (killing royalties or agents) are much more difficult to achieve and gives less points (even if these points cannot be stolen).
Â·) The idea of not being able to win if you have a teammate in the last place is nice, it forces you to do at least of team play and is another viable strategy... But then it is really difficult to come from the last place and have chances to win (most likely, one of your buddies will be able to win once you stop being last).

As they say, it's a game for gamers. For "heavy gamers", I would say. 

In my opinion, it's too long as game for being that chaotic. Still, I enjoyed the first game and I would play again... but from time to time.

An interesting game for sure and one I would rarely say no to playing, but not one I would want to play very often. 

I like that the game plays fairly quick - I was surprised how little downtime there is between your turns.  Game length can vary a lot though: a session can last for what feels like too long or be over almost before you know it.

My main criticism, is that ASiE isn't streamlined and doesn't feel particularly well balanced.  ASiE is trying to do a lot at once.  Of course, that's also the charm to this wacky game. Take that out and you kind of gut the unique flavor it possesses.

I've played with 5 or 6 different people and they all liked it.  People who don't like a bit of chaos and who need balance over all else, won't appreciate this game.

This is a pretty wild ride. A game that can end in 20 mins or 120 mins, that has you bombing Cthulhu old ones using Sherlockian figures, that may or may not have zombies roaming the capital cities of Europe, or vampires even. Every game is different. You need to determine who's on your team based on what people are doing to score points, then score more points than the other team (to knock them out of contention) and then have more points than each other player in your team to win. So you don't need to be leading the VP race to win, as long as you're collectively beating the other team and each other player in your own team. If someone's intent on blowing up old ones, then it's pretty clear they're on the Restorationist team, and if someone is pushing up the score on one of the team tracks, that's a pretty strong indicator on where they stand as well. But they could be bluffing. Within the game, you're playing out influence cubes onto cards to win them and add them to your deck, or to cities to score points and add the city card to your deck (a la A Few Acres Of Snow), and hope your improved deck will allow you to pull off a series of moves at some point to end the game quickly just after pulling off a score coup. City points are very easy to win and take off other people, so the game can be very swing-y once it's clear who's on which team. So not only is the game a wild thematic ride, it's also surprisingly wild mechanically given there's no luck in the game, excepting what you draw and who gets picked on. Which makes for a surprisingly entertaining experience for a game that's built on Euro roots.

RATING: 7.5
Quite interesting. When you first see it and have it explained it appears quite odd as it blends a lot of mechanics together, but in the end they work out quite well. You play in teams, which are unknown and can be unbalanced (our main issue with the game) and you collect cards on the board which you can then have stolen from you. With these cards you create a deck which you cycle through and try to get points with assassinations or increasing your factions standing. There are a few victory conditions and there is one winner, but you cannot win if a player on your faction is in last, so there is some teamwork needed. Very original.

RATING: 9
When I first came across this game and read up about the mechanics etc I had a really hard time seeing how it would all fit together and flow as it seemed like a Frankenstein's Monster of a game. Deck building with area control, bidding for cards, hidden roles and team scoring coupled with a theme based in the 19th Century where the Mythos have taken control of most countries royal families that borrowed characters from fiction and non-fiction alike, namely the most important characters from Conan-Doyle's Sherlock Holmes books.

The theme sold it for me really so I went ahead and picked it up. I am so glad I did, the aforementioned mechanics all fit together in a very smooth way and the team play/hidden roles really make the end-game interesting. When the game ends the team with the lowest scoring player all lose, the winner being the highest scoring player on the remaining team. Once people have figured out who is on which team, the interplay becomes fantastic; you want to make sure that all of the players on your team are ahead of the lowest scoring player on the other team while at the same time ensuring that you stay ahead. This can end up with players from both teams working against the leader only to have to switch to building up their own points at the right time to steal a victory. Truly brilliant.

Cthulhu theme.

RATING: 6
This is ostensibly a team game, but there's only one winner.  The winning team is whichever team does not include the player with the lowest score, and whoever has the highest score on the winning team is the winner.  To complicate things, teams are hidden, so you have to deduce who is on whose team (though since the teams have very different goals, it often isn't hard).  So the first half of the game consists of trying to figure out who people are, the second half often becomes a game of bash the leader.  The rules are very complicated and have tons of little niggles, but maybe rules confusion is thematic here?  I don't hate this game, but it's not really my cup of tea.

1 play - I played a 5-player learning game at BGG.con which lasted about 3 hours. I quite enjoyed the early game. I added some cards to my deck, took control of some locations and even assassinated royalty. However, the game devolved near the end. A Study in Emerald is a team game, but not really. Let me explain: At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a secret loyalty card. A player can either be a restorationist (good guy) or loyalist (bad guy). Each player keeps track of his score individually. When the game eventually ends, the team with the team member with the lowest overall score is completely eliminated. Then, among the remaining team, the player with the highest score is the winner. This is the most ridiculous way to determine a winner ever devised. With significant point swings possible on a turn and during end game, it was impossible to predict who would win, or what a team should do in order to not be on the losing side. The shifting target of victory is one of the things that I disliked about Pax Porfiriana, but compared to ASiE, Pax seems clear as day. I mentioned the end game bogging: due to this murky nature of victory, it became 90 minutes of chicken, with players playing tug-of-war over various locations on the board in an attempt to not lose. I really must play again, because the game canât be as bad as I thought, so for now I give it a generous 6.

+ Very Original game. It's clearly something different then other games I've played before. If you would ask me to compare it with an other game, I couldn't name 1.

- Explaining the rules is a tough job. I'm really glad that for my first game I had an explanation from some experienced players/explainers (Myriam & Surya gave demo's of this game at Essen 2013).

While this game has some complicated sounding rules, in truth it plays smoothly, because most of the rules are represented well on the different cards in the game. This game has a really fascinating secret allegiance system, where at the end of the game the side that has the player with the fewest points is eliminated, and then the player that has the most points on the remaining side is the winner. There is a TON of variability in this game, but what you are essentially doing is trying to figure out who is on which side, and then score points through deckbuilding, controlling cities, and assassinating other players and Elder Gods. This game can take a long time to master, but the learning ride is wild.

I'm giving the benefit of the doubt to Wallace here, because I've played this five times and I still can't figure out if it's a glorious mess or just a mess. There's so much going on: Sherlock Holmes! Deckbuilding! Cthulhu! Hidden identities! Vampires! Area control! Zombies! and it feels like it won't really shine until all the players at the table have a really good understanding. That hasn't happened yet because all my games have included at least one new player. But I've still been having a lot of fun trying to navigate the craziness and the overwhelming options. 

I've been a restorationist four times out of five so far, and in three of those I used the same strategy of nosing ahead and then sending myself mad as quickly as possible. I know there are lots of ways my opponents could have stopped me, but I haven't yet figured out what a restorationist is supposed to do if that quick-win doesn't work. Each play leaves me keen for another, hoping to get more of a hold on the thing, but I've been let down eventually by Wallace games that gave me that feeling before (like AFAOS). 

UPDATE: it happened again. Sold, as I'm just never going to get regular play with the experienced group it needs to shine.

A Study in Emerald is a hidden identity deck building game that functions... just ok.  After a couple of play throughs I have to say that the majority of the game is fairly boring.  Everything is quite fluid and clever, but it just misses that spark of excitement.

However, that's all quite alright because the end game climax is absolutely ingenious.  There are two teams, but only one player may win.  All members of the team with the player in last place when the game ends loose, and victory goes to the highest point player on the opposite team.  This makes the endgame incredibly tense as everyone lies and tries to figure out who's on what team and if it's safe for them to rush for victory.

Amazingly witty game of deduction and tactics. At first glance, you might think it's too hard to keep your identity a secret, and you might be right, but the game is more about laying low and scoring the less obvious points until it's time to go full throttle. There is also a chance the game ends from a bold player attempting an assassination, but they must be extra careful since the faction with the lowest scoring member cannot qualify to win- a very tricky form of semi-cooperative play! I loved every second of A Study in Emerald and can't wait to return.

RATING: 6
One core mechanic of the game  is deck-building, but there  is also as much game "on the board", when you move your agents to assassinate Great Old Ones or other agents. It also does not feel much like other deck builders (e.g. Dominion), since you can easily contested or denied when "buying" new cards. Also there are much less cards for combos ("draw 2 cards + 1 action" like) and you cannot easily get rid of bad cards (i.e. thin out your deck). I also enjoyed the team-with-hidden-roles mechanic, which really leads to interesting win conditions, which are accompanied by quite tricky game-end conditions.

The theme is a total winner for me. The art work is really good and board looks fine as well (maybe a bit crowded, but that fits the theme about Cthulhu and insanity). Only some font size on the cards is too small, such that it is hard to have an overview of the available cards. A downside of the clever and numerous  game mechanics are the many little rules and some fiddliness, which come with those. I think this game is hard to get on the table with new players, but I would recommend ASiE to any game group, which wants to sink their teeth in that game.

Unfortunately I do not like the central mechanism with influence and blocking very much. Also gameplay drags quite a bit. This in combination with the immense amount of rules really make me not want to play this any time soon. Since I am more a Euro player, I also dislike some of the Ameritrash take-that-mechanisms (as for example the double agent aspect, which can destroy your whole plans). However, I have to admit that ASiE pulls of semi-cooperativeness and asymmetrical teams really well. Arghh, I am really on the fence with the games, because there are so many things to like (teams, game-changing events, theme) and quite a lot which is not up my alley (amount of rules and exceptions, double agents, influence stalemate).

7.5 Played 4 player with a better grasp of the rules.  Still couldn't say that we got every detail correct, but...
With 2 vs 2, people were second guessing each others roles and bumping off agents, or was that just me.  Yes we lost, I think, still a bit confused as we ended the game by killing a loyalist and then re-read the rules on agent deaths.

I really liked all of the ingredients of this game, particularly how the secret alliances influence the deck building aspect. Be too subtle about it and your deck will be inefficient to achieve what you aim for. Be too forceful and you'll be giving away your allegiance too early and possibly permit others to control the timing of the game to their advantage.

This game requires the right group though... all players should be interested in the game premises and aware of the importance to balance their play style otherwise the flavours that make this game so interesting gets lost in the process.

Half of the mechanics are great, but the other half don't fit into this game. ASiE has me coming back because of the good mechanics (auction/bidding, card drafting, and deception). However, a few of the Permanent Effect cards, the Vampire, and the Zombie cards don't really fit this game. It's Cthulu with Sherlock Holmes characters, vampires, and zombies. If this game included these themes, why not just throw in Jack the Ripper, Dracula, Jeckyll & Hyde, etc...
After 2 plays, I'd like to play one more time just to solidify or change any doubts I have about this game.
Again, most of the mechanics are great, it's just a few of the themes and other mechanics that ruin a potentially phenomenal game.

Starting cards are better than what you buy (or at least competitive), and your starting deck is already thin -- so why buy more cards?  Hidden allegiance mechanic is degenerate.  Most player interaction is 'bash the leader'.  Read the short story, but forget the game.

It's unclear to me yet whether the difficulty in nailing down exactly which side folks are on will adversely affect the end game by making it too much of a crap shoot.  But I like the flow of the game fairly well so far and look forward to teaching the game.

21-05-2015. Rated after 1 play. Typical Wallace deck-builder with strange end-game. You get a secret role card that makes you a loyalist or restaurationist and receive an Agent token. This is your guy and is represented on the board by token. During the game, you try to up the ranking of the side your at and decrease the other ranking. If it ever reaches a certain value based on the number of players it triggers the end game. There are other ways to end the game, amongst others killing a restaurationist.

As more of MW's games, you build a deck and take 2 actions per turn. These actions allow you to travel, buy new cards, control cities or attack old ones. To control a city or buy a card, you place influence there by playing cards. If at the start of your next turn, you still have most influence you win the card or agent or City. This scores you VP. By playing bomb cards you can also kill ancient ones or hide them (?), which is depending on your goal (kill for restaurationist, hide for loyalist). You can also kill opponents agents, but the opponent's main agent must be killed last.

The game is interesting, but the end game wonkey. If played in teams, the player with least VPs basically makes his whole team lose. The win is given to the player of the other team with the highest VPs. This is kind of strange. 

I like MW deckbuilders and I liked this one. I do feel that the end-game is weird and the secret roles are not very secret. You almost always notice in the cards that people are trying to buy or their behavior what side the are. This is kind of weird, as even you are in the lead but your teammate is struggling, you know you have to start helping because otherwise you'll lose.

RATING: 7.2
I really like this game a lot. The first few times I played, it seemed like an exercise in chaos but that impression was caused by the wide variety of available strategies. The design of this game is inspired. There are many paths to winning with devious, subtle strategies possible at every turn, yet the overall mechanics of the game are quite simple. The nature of the strategies employed also varies based on how many people are playing. A Study In Emerald works well with 3 players but the more players there are, the more interesting and involved the second guessing of player identities becomes. The asymmetric point scoring for the Loyalist and Restorationists forces each side to adopt a different focus, and provides a lot of replayability. No two games have been alike due to the randomization of the cards in play. The card mix really changes the flow of the game. It's exciting to watch as a story is told through the cards as they come into play. There are a wide range of potential moves each turn with several advantagous paths usually presenting themselves, but there are never enough resources available to do everything. A successful strategy take discipline and patience.  The game remains fun even if you know you're behind, which is most of the time for me, because it's such a delight to partake in the story that the game tells.

RATING: 8.5
A very interesting take on team games, deck building, and area control: I would recommend this game over almost any medium-heavy weight hidden traitor game.  I upgraded my original 6 rating to 8.  It took me my third play to finally wrap my head around the team dynamics.  Now I think this is one of most novel ways to have 2 teams interact.  It has the mechanic in some other games where the team with the higher lowest score wins, but in ASiE, you are not really working with your teammate. I love how it may be the best strategy to knock down your "teammate" so that you are clearly ahead of them, making them a target for the other team to try to push down lower, which can then leave you free to try to race to win (as long as you've been able to knock an opponent lower than your teammate).  I think this game works best with 5, where you are guaranteed to have 3 vs 2.  My only negative I have is that players can fall into a trap where they can end the game but don't want to because they won't win, which can feel pretty anti-climatic when then another player finally ends the game and wins, but this is really just because it's hard for players to get out of the mindset of "hurt the leader" which here often isn't the best choice - you need to "hurt the losers on the other team, help the loser on your team."

RATING: 7
This game is a hot mess. It's like every time the designer was faced with a choice between awesome but potentially frustrating mechanics and merely ok but stable/safe mechanics, they erred on the side of awesome. I love it for that. And the theme supports it. But it's very possible to have players end up frustrated, confused, or otherwise very disenchanted when things combine oddly. Some plays will suck.

Also, the whole "your team wins then YOU win" thing leads to interesting player interactions, but will /really/ piss people off if they don't understand it fully going in and start questioning why their supposed teammate is stealing their points.

--Dec2013-- I may be a bit more enthusiastic about this than I should; but I really enjoyed it, and my kids were pretty enthusiastic, too.  And that's despite the fact that I'm not really a fan of deck-builders.  The theme was charming, and the number of ways that one could mutate the system reminded me a bit of (my favourite game) Princes of the Renaissance for variety and potential opportunities for ingenuity.
--Jan2013-- I'm quite amused by this.  There are some lovely multiplayer dynamics, and loads of things to do (and yet all with [i]purpose[/i]:  this isn't something where everyone picks up a point or two here or there and doesn't interact.)

Intriguing game where you can do all sorts of "fun" stuff. 

Zombie and vampire stuff seems gratuitous, extraneous to me. 

City control is also a bit swingy, as others have noted. 

My biggest concern are the victory conditions, specifically how the last place player loses it for his/her faction. That is the big twist here, and to me a seemingly unrealistic one when the goal on the face of it appears to be helping your faction win and then sorting out the best member of that faction from there. Having to pay so much attention to others in your faction also makes hiding your identity rather irrelevant (seemingly) or even detrimental. 

SO, nice setting, lackluster repeated gameplay. Sold.

Still seems much more fun than its neutered successor, making it sadly unlikely this will get reprinted.

I played this several times while it was being developed and attempted it with the family after I received my Kickstarter copy.

It's not my cup of tea.

The directions are problematic (funny, because I helped proofread them, but in my defense, that effort was copy-editing only, I didn't have a copy of the game in front of me).  

I've never really understood the point of keeping your allegiance a secret.  I've found it hard enough to accomplish anything, much less have time for subterfuge.

The most fun I've ever had with the game was when I won once during play testing.  I was not given a moment to savour my cleverness, instead I was told that I wouldn't have gone for the win when I did if I'd known what I was doing.

An interesting game. From my one play, and from reading comments here, this does seem to be a game where the experience risks being affected by a player not getting it or refusing to get it or just not putting any effort in. But it's interesting all the same. The room for bluffing and twisted negotiations is an interesting aspect, and it works very well as a hidden loyalties game for 3 (haven't tried it with more yet). I like the art and the production values all round - some card scould have done with more text more clearly explaining their uses and limitations. Needs explaining well, needs patience and concentration - I think there's the depth here to reward that. Ankh-Morpork is more elegant and accessible, but so far this looks much more interesting (although it would be less likely to hit the table in my house).

RATING: 9
Kudos to Martin Wallace for incorporating a whole raft of characters and themes so well together. I don't have another game in my collection that feels quite like it and that's a big reason for it to be rated highly. Besides that it's just fun. I'm very impressed with how all the parts of the game come together so nicely - every component and track has the potential to be used to trigger an end game or change the way players have to approach their turn. Wonderful.

Rules are fairly simple. Play duration is just about right, but highly variable depending up player experience and card distribution.

What we have here is a deck building game, but also an area majority game as an acquisition mechanic for further cards  - general cards, agents who cane assassinated and cities which can be taken from you. Cleverly the card options are split between twelve cities on the board, with each city itself divided between the option of acquiring the city card or a variable card from a small deck.

There's a lot of nice little mechanics blending together here: You've got your hidden characters that are gradually revealed, your semi team scoring system where you lose if one of your teammates has the lowest victory point total, your timing element, deck building, unique action card abilities, etc. Not all cards will come out game to game, so games can play out differently.

Players will usually in the early game make a grab for cards that bolster their strategy, or potentially block the other side. Then gradually further card purchases decline, not because they aren't attractive, but because play moves onto assassinations of agents and royals, and gaining control of cities. The cities have different values where assassinations are easier than in other cities, or hiding Royals is cheaper, etc. The end effect is that players move their agents around the board to attack others, or sit in a better defensive position, or defend acquired cities, or assist in acquiring cities. There's plenty of options and with double agents some uncertainty. It's all very clever the way it all comes together so nicely.

When it comes to triggering the end game you can find yourself in some funny situations here where your teammates won't let you win by purposely keeping behind on points. All the while the true leader, but not outright leader in victory points, pushes for an end of game trigger while the other side self destructs. It's all good fun and rather amusing. (Had one game where a newbie bluffed till the very end about his loyalty - fantastic that you can have so much suspicion and uncertainty in this game.) Timing and a surprise move up your sleeve are essential for a win against experienced players - and of course they're thinking the same thing.

Nice game. Different. Easy to learn. Hard to master. Plays in under 90 minutes. Fun theme. Tiny fonts. Busy board. This is not going to be a game for everyone, but for me it's just the right amount of chaos to fit the theme, and it's really been done in such a fun and interesting way that I'm rating it above the sum of its parts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This can be a hard game to digest, but the innovation of the side with the biggest loser being eliminated provides enough delicious tension that it is worth fighting through the fog of your first few plays.

The core of the game at first seems to be deck-building, but then attention shifts to area control on the board. These mechanics are the stew to which is added funky stuff like royal assassinations, agent-on-agent violence, vampires, and other spices. You never get the same taste with each spoonful, and this is a good thing.

Wow.  This game sure does have a lot going on, with some serious rules explaining as well.  Once you get going, tho, it churns right along.  I'm normally not a fan of area control and despite the fact that this game has it in bunches, it's implemented in such a way that makes it enjoyable.  I love the mechanic of how the person in last place causes all of their faction to lose.  One of the oddest elements of the game is that it can end in 15 minutes or can push three hours.  Overall, it's good and certainly different enough from most of my collection to stay.  I'm giving it a tentative 7, with room to go up.  One caveat tho, this is really just a 4- or 5-player game.  I wouldn't want to play with less than that.

[3 plays] 5 players first, then 3 player. I think it is a better game once all the players are more familiar, and/or playing with fewer players. Much more engaging either way if it is moving faster and no one is AP'ing too much.

Lots of possible actions, lots to consider, lots to learn about ways to play. I think we could play this 10 times and still not have all the ideas about tactics and strategies. There is chaos and this is every bit as much about the experience as it is about scheming your way to victory.

I was initially super-excited about this game when it was first announced, but now that I have the game, I don't really know what to make of it.  It's a Frankenstein's Monster of game mechanics and ideas, and it's hard to get an idea of how this game really plays without playing it with other people.

At its core, ASiE is a deck-builder where you auction for cards, but gets confusing very fast with all the additional elements layered on top of that: agents that can physically move around the board, hidden loyalties and faction-specific scoring, multiple end-game conditions, cards like Vampires and Zombies that add a whole new element into the game if they show up, etc.  It's almost like we're buying this game 3 expansions in.

Fantastically themed secret identity, area control, deck-building, VP grabbing game. In particular, I enjoyed the deck-building mechanic which is similar to a Few Acres of Snow. That is, there is no open shop but rather players must control an area by having the most influence there on their turn in order to receive a card from it. The minor hidden role/deduction element tied in with having to work together as a team (and yet still wanting the most VPs for myself) is a great hit with me as well.

1 play, 2er

Wow, what a fun game! I'm not really a big fan of Lovecraft (never read the books nor gotten particularly immersed in the universe) but I think the genre is kinda cool in a weird twisted sort of way. But I did enjoy the few Sherlock Holmes books I read as a kid, and of course the BBC series (and even the recent movies!). The [url=http://www.neilgaiman.com/mediafiles/exclusive/shortstories/emerald.pdf]Neil Gaiman short story (http://www.neilgaiman.com/mediafiles/exclusive/shortstories/emerald.pdf)[/url] was also quite enjoyable. 

So why am I talking about all this story stuff? Because the game, even without any plastic bits or 10,000 chits (FFG!) or multi-colored polyhedral dice, actually managed to evoke those themes for me! I could imagine being part of some shadowy secret organization recruiting agents (and double agents!) throughout the world, creating or obtaining secret knowledge, collecting resources, etc. The deck-building part of the game worked as a great way to model that process! And when you encounter the Great Ones, whether to kill them or to save them, you even get to go a little insane! And since you use only a subset of the cards in a game (less than half?), the story will be a bit different with every play. If only I were more familiar with all the characters (I assume they're from various Holmes tales?)!

Mechanically, the game is an evolution of A Few Acres of Snow (and Mythotopia). There's a big deck-building element, but it's only part of the game: there's also area majority / auction and secret teams. The deck-building is more like Ascension than Dominion: you have a huge variety of cards, with only few available at any time. But the available pool doesn't change nearly as quickly as in Ascension, so you can actually do a bit of planning (while not getting bogged down in planning your whole game strategy at the start, like you do in Dominion)! It's sort of Mage Knighty, except that you cycle through cards more quickly? 

And then there's the team mechanic, with a very clever twist. At the start, players are assigned to teams randomly and secretly. At the end, the entire TEAM is eliminated in the end if any of their players has the lowest score! Wow, what (seemingly, since I haven't played with more than 2 yet!) a cool way to balance random teams! Even if you're outnumbered 3 to 1, you can win as long as the others work together enough to prevent one of them from having the lowest score!

I am really looking forward to playing this again!

The short story is fabulous.

1st play chaotic. Not sure about the thematic conceit. Sort of a super disc world/moongha mash up. May need a few plays to get into and suspect I will like it most with 5 and with take that players- very player dependent.

My 4th game was magical - one of those gaming experiences I will never forget and maybe occur once a year at most. This has boosted the game to a nine.

There's a lot to love about this game - deck-building, area control, auctions - but the best aspect are the hidden teams. You want to be the best player on the winning team, which is a great idea that I haven't seen in any other game. The rules are clunky and over-complicated at times, and not friendly to new players, so the second edition is also worth considering.

The theme is all over the place. The mystery teams and the rule that the lowest player in the game eliminates his entire team are strange. The card powers are crazy. The auctions frequently get out of hand. I'm never quite sure how I'm doing. The rule book is not particularly good.

Somehow I still enjoy each play. The auction mechanic is good. The card powers are impactful. There's plenty of room for back-stabbery. With a little more frequent play the muddy rulebook wouldn't matter. It's a confusing chaotic mess, but I'm looking forward to my next play.

Great design, fantastic fun. Possibly more than any other game this allows for the player to approach it in any way they wish. Want to raise an army of zombies? Check. Want to destroy Great Old Ones? Check. Want to control cities? Check. What about turning Sherlock Holmes into a vampire? Check. A game that makes me smile.

RATING: 7
Solid design (not one of Wallace's best, however), with a great theme and appealing artwork, but with some rules and card interaction issues. 

And what's with the tiny font on the cards, which slows the game down until you get familiar with them. C'mon...

I played two five-player games at a convention, and enjoyed them both (but watch out for players with AP). However, the game seems to end too suddenly and too quickly, and it's usually obvious by then what faction each player is associated with.

I think the game may be a bit too clever for its own good.

At $80, this release has exceeded a price point that I feel comfortable paying, so I will not be buying it.

A very enjoyable game. 
The deckbuilding mechanism is the same as in A Few Acres of Snow, but here we have a multiplayer game. The theme is fresh and well implemented. And the game has secret identities which is a nice aditional twist: the players must be careful when bashing others (the whole faction of the weakest player loses).

Number of plays: 12: W6 L6.

RATING: 9
Played with 3p and the experience was good but I think a couple of us played it 'wrong' with too much focus on deck building and didn't focus enough on the area control and track control which are probably more important.

It's a fascinating mix of deck building, area control, and special abilities combined with the usual Wallace feel and action mechanisms. It comes together rather well and for me felt far more thematic than a game like Arkham Horror. The weakest part with 3 were the hidden roles though I expect they become far more interesting with more players. I think the most fascinating thing is breadth of the decision space. The game is very open about how you achieve your objectives. 

I can only see this game going up in my estimation.

I had played this once in Essen the Wednesday before the show, but I didn't feel comfortable writing about it. I wanted to get in one more game before writing about it. The reason is that this game is Martin's way of saying "You want one of my complex games? Here is a complex game, chew on that". Not only is there a sizable rulebook, there is also A LOT going on. A lot of that depends on what cards come out. There are some big chunks of rules that only come in play with certain cards, which might not be in the game. This makes for a game that will be quite different each time. And will affect your style of play. If you don't adapt, you probably won't do well. There's a lot to take in and keep track of, but once you keep going, it's a wonderful experience. I feel like this is the game that [thing=15987][/thing] should have been.

Initial rating: 7.5

RATING: 7
Mechanically it is pretty simple as it is a deck builder where you try to build your deck from cards on the board. The interesting thing is that each player is secretly one of two factions. The faction of the player who has the fewest points at the game end is eliminated, which means that if you are in first place in points you still lose because your faction lost. I'd like to play it again now that I have a better feel for what I need to do.

RATING: 5.5
I've not yet found a Martin Wallace design that I've really loved and I'm sad to say that this falls in to the same category for me.

When did excluding so many of the materials of a game become such a key design feature? Surburbia does the same thing and it breaks the game. Here it is mostly just annoying - oh, you drew both the agents I've recruited as double agents? The ones I drew aren't even in the game. Oh, you bid up zombies? Here's the card that discards them. Isn't randomness fun?

The hidden roles are an interesting idea, but there's not enough reason to keep your role hidden - assassinating characters as a Loyalist might keep you hidden for a while, but you're not scoring any points doing it. In the play and a half I've worked out every role within a few turns, regardless of how much people were trying to cover their tracks. It quickly becomes a game of take-that against your own team to ensure you can come out on top and 45+ minutes of take-that was never interesting.

The idea of combining deck-building with a traditional board game is terrific, and A Study in Emerald does this well.  This is also a semi-cooperative game in here, and that works too.  The designer went bananas with the theme, and there isn't one logical way to describe how bombs, secret agents, vampires, zombies, royalty, and Cthulu come together to describe how each of 10+ available actions might score on any given turn.  It's a very rulesy point salad that leaves our group arguing after 5+ games.

I love the Mythos. I love Neil Gaiman's writing. This overwrought, underdeveloped, bloated, chromy game ruins both. Way too much down time. Pasted on theme. Boring.

p.s. as someone who recently got reading glasses, I have less patience for publishers who use teeny-tiny fonts. They mostly seem to have figured out the color blindness issues, why can't they avoid tiny fonts? They weren't even necessary in this game, since the majority of the space on the cards is unused.

Makes good use of its bizarre theme! Mechanically far from simple, and if you prefer Euro-style games then you probably will find that the mechanics don't quite justify the reward.

RATING: 8.5
[thing=141517][/thing] is a game in which players are member of one of two teams: the Loyalists of the Restorationist. The Loyalists wants to keep the Old Ones in power, serving them for any purpose, and one of the things they want to do is start an all-out war in which the Old Ones will emerge victorious and unopposed. The Restorationist wants to take down the Old Ones, taking the power back to the hand of humanity.

The games has a few interlaying mechanics, such as: area influence, deck building, hand management and partnerships. This last one is one of the attractions and complains regarding the game, because of the game end score: the player in last place eliminates his/her whole team! The winner will be the player with the most points in the remaining team. Seems fun, right? And, for me, it is! But I can see times where this won't be as much fun, maybe becuse the last player stayed in last on purpose, only to screw his/her team. Or if the player wants almost complete control regarding his play - remember, this is a team game, so the performance of the team is basically as important as your own perfomance (because your goal is to stay ahead in points, but also should be aware of the player in last, and make sure he/she is in the other team).

The deck building in the [thing=141517][/thing] reminds me of the one in [thing=79828][/thing]: you take cards from the board, but for the city and agents cards you can lose control of them, so the card will go to the new controller deck. I like this deck building quite a bit, specially since there isn't a way to get rid of cards (there is no "trash" action, only some cards that you can use only one time then they are out of the game), so you really must make some tough decisions about which cards to take and which to avoid.

Theme-wise [thing=141517][/thing] delivers a good experience: it do feel as a battle of opposite sides. The cards make sense inside the Mythos. There is Madness, double agents, travel, and other things that make this game seems like a really good experience while playing. It is fun to see Irene Adler using her charm to take agents from other players, or see the airship Nadar taking agents anywhere in the board, or watch as a hired assassin takes the life of the nobility, and so many other moments like these.

For the bad part, the manual is seriously lacking in so many parts (like the use of blocking discs), and even it contradicts the player aid. Wallace surely didn't do its best work writing a manual in this game - not even close. Also, there are many more cards than you can use in one game, which enhances the replay value, but makes any strategy harder, since some agents and importants cards (for one team or the other) could be out of a whole game. So the game turns out to be much more tatical - you will have to change what you want to do in mid-flight due to the cards that show up (but this can be difficult, since, as I said, you can't usually get rid of cards you already took sooner).

Even with this, I really enjoyed the game - maybe it was the players, not the game - but, for the time being, the game gets the fame for the great time!

Is this a good game? Probably not... Is this a fun game to play? Most certainly! A euro full of theme and not only because the setting is that of an archetypal ameritrash game but because every crazy idea has been thrown in and somehow it works - if the group plays it mainly for the ride and not the mechanisms. Late in the game you'll most likely end up in a see-saw game of city control but who cares if you till then have battled vampires, joined clubs and underground leagues, have killed old ones while watching Cthulhu destroy a city and Bismarck holding another in his iron grip??
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
Aside from a number of issues with the rules (which require several play-throughs, a critical reading of the FAQ and scrutinizing the Rules forum threads to get a good grip on), this is a very enjoyable game with a great theme if you're a Cthulhu mythos/Victoriana fan. The secret roles make for quite a challenge as it's difficult to be sure exactly who's on your team, and the deckbuilding mechanic works well. The game typically divides into two phases, the first being deck building and the second being the all-out rush for points and mutual assassinations as you jockey for the winning position. I recommend playing with 4-5.

Insane. But with a weird genius to its exuberance & meant for those who can relish its unblinking head-on collision of Euro-mechanics into acute player-driven risks.

You want to play with others who'll get the underlying tempo demands that are the heart of the thing, and appreciate the lavish playground and hilarity flogging disguised in the simple statement "on your turn, take two actions."

Best played loose, at high speed, and don't oversteer.

A Study in Emerald has elements of worker placement, deck building, resource management, and hidden agendas linked together in one of the most elegant games I have ever played.  Emerald is the first complex game that was smooth to play, and actually was true to the time indicator on the box, even when introduced to a full compliment of five players who have never tried it.

Do you want to kill Nyarlathotep, hide Azathoth, murder other agents or perhaps impose a more horrible fate on them?  Then let the path to your bliss be your guide.

I have played Emerald a number of times and feel that I barely scratched to surface of the viscous slime on the tentacled tip of the thing.  The fantastic vistas of gaming Emerald implies is still somewhat incomprehensible to my human mind.  I will brace myself with resolve as I embark on a path to delve deeper into the madness...

This game is fantastic! One of the best games I have played in my short stint in the hobby. The rules are dense but the gameplay is intriguing. 

Random fact: I found out from a play tester that the team mechanic used to be based on the total number of pooled points for a team. The team with the lower amount of points would be knocked out, and from the winning team, the person with the most points would be declared the winner.

This game is madness and I love it for it.

I think it's rare to find this type of game full of deduction and confrontation be such a complex and deep web of options.  There are so many possibilities for sneakers and devilish plotting.  It even goes so far as to pit you against your own "teammates".  The game takes multiple plays to wrap your head around, but once you do you're rewarded with a multitude of ways to win and plots to hatch, no two games will feel the same.

This game is a melting pot of all of my favorite genres, area control, hidden roles and deduction, melded with deck building in a novel way that makes it more exhilrating than usually possible.  The scoring system sounds insane at first, but brilliant once you see how the game plays out.

It's unfortunate that the game is so overwhelming on your first play that it demands a dedicated group.  Even more unfortunate is how limited the print run was and how unreasonably marked up it is.

Officially my favorite game, I love it more and more with each play and I bring it with me to every game night with my group.  The only reason why it's not a perfect 10 is just for minor hang ups with the rulebook, and I think the game needs a player board to keep track of cubes in your inventory and provide some player aid info.

I just wish I could get more people to play it...

Opinion after one game played. This game is very hard to master so it might change after future plays. Right now I love it, the complexity is great, it's exiting and very immersive. For fsns of heavy games only, but that's how I like them. Plus, the artwork is fantastic. The one thing I hate is that there is no picture on double-agent counters - it mekes it much harder to recognise your agentsm as the names are hard to remember.

RATING: 8
Secret roles, deck building, and area control. A good, tense game. Cards that let you cycle through the deck are hard to come by and therefore getting them is important. Probably the most important factor for effective gameplay. Pretty good at 4, probably best at 5. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played twice. There's some interesting ideas, but in the end there's too much tit-for-tat and often just arbitrary screwage. For this game to be enjoyable it needs to be over in under an hour, but I feel that with more experience if anything the game will take longer as players become more savvy about bashing the leader.

I like my middleweight games to have simple rules, which is why I only like Martin Wallace's heavier designs as he just can't help but make games that are overwrought and inelegant.

RATING: 4
There was so much about this game that made it an insta-buy for me -- Neil Gaiman, Martin Wallace, Lovecraft, Sherlock Holmes, and deck-building -- that I should have looked more closely and seen exactly what sort of game it actually was.  It's a confrontational, take-that sort of game where players are trying to manipulate an ever-shifting line of conditions in order to win the game.  That means that players are basically out to get each other without being 100% sure who their allies are (oh yeah, there are hidden roles, too), and someone who's close to winning will suddenly find themselves at the bottom of the score track after something shifts from one person's control to another.  The game might be better with a little more development, but as it is, it's not my kind of game, which is a real disappointment.

What an incredible slog of under developed mechanics and half-baked ideas this is. Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed my plays and it continues to intrigue me. Still, it seems over complicated for what it is trying to do. I love the idea of multiple changing win conditions, but I'm not so keen on having each card that changes it requiring you to learn a half page of new rules that only come into play every 5th game or so. It makes it incredibly hard to get into a rhythm.

At first I was skeptical of a streamlined 2nd edition...but after a few runs through this hot mess, I am now looking forward to it.

RATING: 8
Thematically a mashup of Sherlock Holmes, Cthulu, and historical anarchist figures.  Players are either agents for Cthulu or against, and work toward propping up the Cthulu status quo or toppling them.  An insane game with a mish mash of mechanics sewn together into a Frankenstein.  So many moving parts coupled with so many avenues of opportunity results in a game not for the faint-hearted.  Nothing is secure and players aggressively keep others in check.  Nowhere to hide in this game.

Although the theme is strong, the unfamiliar oddball theme provides little intuitiveness to the rules.  This can frustrate inexperienced players as it is difficult to absorb everything the game throws at you.  And despite the fantastic theme dripping everywhere, it really doesn't generate much of a narrative.  That could be because players are so focused on the dials and levers that they cannot clearly see the forest for the trees.  It could also be that despite all of the theme, the dials and levers starkly remain dials and levers.  Great art throughout, especially the depiction of historical figures and fictional figures alike as well as the manic board.  Components are top notch, but the small print on the cards is frustrating, more so as the cards are standard sized.

The disparate themes mashed together and laid on disparate mechanics created a highly original and fun game.  Nothing else like it.  Very curious to find out what experienced play is like.

While I think this is a very good game, I do think some of the rule exceptions could have been paired back to improve the games accessibility. For example, the double agent is cool. But the exceptions for the double agent for sherlock and moriaty depending on which side a player is on? Also the vampires and zombie rules seem like just such big chunks of extra rules that you have to revisit whenever they happen to come out in a game. There feels like there already so much going on I feel that maybe they should have been trashed. Either that or perhaps become more of a feature. All in all though, a good enough game for me to play 5 times in quick succession and then decided to purchase.
UPDATE: 8 games on and knowing the cards and exceptions makes the game flow a whole lot better. Great game if you invest the time.

RATING: 6
It's not possible for me to fully get behind a game where there are, without exaggeration, between 20 and 25 items up for auction (influence) simultaneously: the city cards, the normal cards, the ongoing effect cards, and other luxury items that I'm probably forgetting.

On a experiential level, I was never convinced that my cardplay amounted to much, except for killing a fellow agent occasionally, arm-wrestling over cities (which seemed overly important), and bumping up the green track a few times.  Also, purchasing cubes from limbo or the reserve is a common action that is integral to the game, but isn't particularly exciting.

I really like the rule where the lowest-scoring player automatically eliminates his/her entire team from contention, but at the same time I never felt that I could do much to improve the position of that low-scoring player, if necessary.

Finally, it's true that Wallace's designs continue to have indie street cred.  But that same credibility is saddled with the baggage of indie editing and indie rules, and that's always a huge strike against his games.

Another of the hidden teammate games however the winning condition that your teammate cannot be in last place can cause the game to drag on a long time. I enjoyed the game play but not the end game.

An amazing "kitchen sink" game that has so much going on, you'll feel like you're under attack by the evil old ones as you try to keep everything straight. Phenomenal.

This game is bonkers. It's a mish-mash of elements thrown together, full of Wallace's usual obscure rules and corner cases but something of a wild ride and very fitting for the theme. Lots to think about and with the potential for some very entertaining games. However, if everyone concentrates on the tug of war over city points to the exclusion of everything else, it can turn into a dull Euro game. Don't do that and it's brilliant.

Update: After eleven plays I've moved this up to a 10. So many things to do, routes to take, levers to pull. Other players' choices can have you adjusting your plans or realising further possibilities. There's bluffing, deduction, racing, auctioning, deck building... something for everyone really.

Realy intruging team mechanic and good overall design. Played it once with 3 players, all wanted to play it again and since that second playrhrough I've been trying to plan a new game night to be able to play it some more. Solid game in my book.

My semi regular group doesn't want to commit to this particular game. Quite chaotic and interesting theme/Implementation.  Mishmash of mechanics did not really seem cohesive to me and I found the scoring to be asinine.  The hidden role aspect did not encourage much meta socializing compared to simply paying attention to what your opponents/teammates may be doing.  Pushing the confusion is part of the game but it did not engage me.

RATING: 3
A hidden-alignment game with no incentive or ability to hide your alignment. It defeats its own purpose. For hidden alignment to work, the game needs to have some secret actions, or at least more than two possible win conditions, and actions which works towards more than one of those at once. This game has neither; you can hide your alignment in the early going as you simply work to increase your own power, but you have to start working for your team/against the other pretty soon, and there is no way to be subtle about it.

The game is further ruined by the double agent tiles, which add nothing to the game strategically and merely punish you randomly with very little you can do to mitigate the possibility.

This game would've been mine if Martin Wallace didn't refuse to sell me his SPIEL '13 demo copies. Dangit is this a great game. It's the best secret loyalties game I've ever played, the best deckbuilder, and also a great bidding and area control game.

The board looks fantastic, with great color choices (except for the color blind apparently, as our demo monkey was color blind and told us so) and a beautiful map.

The game can end in one of five different ways, and in order to win you must not only have the most points, another member of your team may not be the player with the least points. Since the player with the lowest score eliminates their entire team from winning. I love this way of managing the balance of power between random teams and loyalties.

It may well be a perfect 10 with a few more plays.

Edit: And now it is a 10. I just love this game, it's fantastic!

Super interesting team game (not enough of which exist) which has each team playing in a different style. It was super confusing on first attempts. I need to play this more to re-evaluate the score.

RATING: 7.65
I didn't play a full game yet, we had to stop halfway through a game so rating can still change. I love the board and the cards. The end game scoring and determining the winner seems to be pretty interesting too because it's kind of semi-cooperative (you have to make sure your teammates are doing well but not good enough to beat you).

2014-01-14 [b]First impression (2p):[/b] [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff]â5â[/bgcolor][/b] There's a whole lot of obtuseness to this game, but I started to appreciate some strategic nuances, although I still am not sure I have a grasp on the game.  Definitely be sure to play this several times in a short timeframe, lest you never progress in your grasp of the game.  I'm sure once we get it, we'll be good.  The question is, will the game?  Also, I've had a couple of epiphanies since playing, so I'm more interested in replaying it.

2014-01-19 [b]Second impression (4p):[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff]â6â[/bgcolor][/b] Given time between games to have a few epiphanies, I enjoyed this much more.  In this game, however, the player who won was my opponent last game, and she just plowed ahead claiming cities, and won with more than twice as many points as second place.  It strikes me that either people have to fight hard over the cities (I was [b]just[/b] starting to try to take her key cities when she got enough points), or hope that she gambled too much, and had the loser on her team.  More play requiredâ¦.

After 2+ Plays: A bunch of rules that don't flow logically or work that well together - makes the game less fun and the rules hard to remember between plays, so I likely won't be doing this one again.

RATING: 7
Based on a Neil Gaiman short story. BEST THEME EVERY - Sherlock Holmes + Cthulhu. The gameplay has a function like Dead of Winter or Betrayal at House on the Hill where one person after start is randomly selected as "the bad guy" through an early game mechanic, but that identity is kept secret for the rest of the game. There are also multiple POTENTIAL secret societies or identities one can take on, and new goals that will come with it. Ultimately you're trying to solve a mystery, but you're also trying I think to be the ONLY one that solves it - or the first? Or maybe as long as you complete your personal and secret goals you win? I can't remember. 

I first played with only 3 and it seemed too easy to figure out who was who. I can't recall what max players are for this game, but I think I would not want to play it again with less than 5. I also remember this being a bit confusing both to learn and to play, but I got the impression that once everyone had the hang of it you would not forget if you played somewhat frequently.

Lots of fun. Only played with three so far.  It's a bit goofy with sigmund Freud and shogoths but it's funny and the gameplay is interesting.  Really like the team scoring system, adds a very interesting element.

Updated:
Played five players,the scoring system is awesome but can be a bit confusing.  We ran into a few issues regarding bombing each other but the geek came through and the precedent has been set for future games.  Lots of fun.

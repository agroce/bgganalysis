RATING: N/A
First game impression:

One of the few titles in the running for learning curve to density ratio. There is no getting started and easing into it, it's jump in. We each picked 2 roles and learned those and used that as a verification task without having to learn everything all at once. Given that there is virtually no structural similarity between roles, it's a massive undertaking to get everything up and running.

I think there are two things that on my first impression were apparent; first, the down time is tough at times. I wonder if that improves with speed. As a friend said "pros: asymmetrical roles, cons; asym roles and downtime" and I think that's sort of true. Whatever role you had for your first game, you're playing the crap out of that for a couple games before you switch just out of necessity. Clocking in at 2.5 hours for a first game, I wonder if this would *ever* hit 75 minutes (in which case it would be probably worth the effort). At it's current running time, it's relegated to super esoteric situations. Not bad, but that stymies it's ability to really shine. Most damning, of the 6 or 7 of us who have played, not many seem interested in investing the additional time and this is a game that begs (if not outright demands) a somewhat consistent group...

Second impression is that it seems to exhibit what I think of as "Munchkin Syndrome" more than most games I see that are inherently king of the hill games. Everyone was relatively close at the end of the game. Was that because we were all evenly matched at our strategic ineptitude or was it due to some other balancing factor in the game? If the later, does that materialize because we keep each other in check until we've exhausted everything and someone slips by, or is it a peaking timing question? I don't know.

Really attractive though. If I had to rate it on a first play, I'm looking at a 6, maybe a weak 7.

[i]tl;dr - Vast has a steep learning curve but is worth the effort if you invest in learning it.[/i]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Vast: the Crystal Caverns is a dungeon crawl where only one player actually explores the dungeon. One player...is the dungeon? One player is a band of goblins who want nothing more than to destroy the knight -- and finally, the fourth player is a terrifying dragon who must shake off his years of slumber and escape the cave!

How can you not be hooked by an asymmetrical game that sounds as awesome as that?? The first time we played, however, it was a three-hour slogfest as we checked up rules mistakes and generally tried to figure out what the heck we were doing. This steep learning curve makes it difficult to recommend, but with players who know what they're doing, I could really see this one being one of the very best games in my collection. 

My two thoughts on Vast: First, I think they did balance the asymmetry of the main, four-player game (and possibly the core five-player game, with the thief). I don't think it's likely they balanced all of the variant scenarios at different player counts, however -- this one definitely suffered from not having the dragon in it, as the knight was too pinned down by the goblins, and the cave ran rampant. Second, I think the game is fundamentally self-balancing, so it requires experienced players at all posts, or else you will suffer from an unbalanced game when a newbie unintentionally throws it. 

Now that I've played four times (as all four basic roles), I feel like I have a better grasp of the overall game balance and flow, and I'm looking forward to this game really maturing in my collection. It's going to take some time, but with players who all know how to play well, Vast may offer one of the most compelling gaming experiences of any game in my collection. Patrick Leder has shown he's willing to tackle unexplored territory and push the hobby in new directions, which is commendable. 

Why doesn't it rank higher? Well, the depth is off-putting (even though that's why you'd buy the game). Good luck playing this one with a newbie. This game only delivers as promised when you have experienced players who won't have to stop to check rules every thirty seconds.

Man this game was a beast to learn, even with 4 competent gamers each learning their own rules.  It was difficult to figure out how it all fit together and by god they should have included a "starting strategies/tactics/moves" section!  The art is also pretty plain and bland.

But once you get going it's fun and a really unique idea.  This one just needed a better production.  I'd definitely play it again but would prefer a second edition from a solid publisher.

I bought this at Gen Con primarily based on the lovely illustrations, production and early impressions. However, now that I have it in hand and have wrestled with it, I find it much like [thing=175878][/thing]: audacious as a feat of design, but in the end is a collection of 5 average games combined into one complex average game. There's loads to explore and understand, but so far at least, it doesn't pay off.

It is complicated (unnecessarily?) with little benefit beyond having truly asymmetric sides. I have played solo a few times and each time, each side seems rather drab - even while imaging what it might be like with other players. I understand I'm putting myself in a position for cat-calls, but so be it: if this game doesn't work solo (where I am learning the mechanics), it isn't going to be played by me with others.

This is a cleverly designed game with fully asymmetric roles. It's pretty cool once it's actually running, but because every role is completely unique, teaching it is an absolute bear. You basically have to hand everyone a double-sided page of rules and sit for 10 minutes while everyone reads theirs. If anyone at the table can't learn effectively from a rulebook, you'll have to walk them through everything about their role and how it works, which hopefully you know yourself already otherwise you'll have to read their sheet as well.

Even once everyone knows how to play, the most damning problem with the game is its length. I'm sure that with repeated plays of people using the same characters the length would go down, but who wants to use the same character again when they're all so different? This means that there's almost always someone playing a role for the first time, so games tend to take at least 2 hours, which is simply far too long for what this game is. Even if everyone knew the roles perfectly I think it would still take too long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
1st play: I have avoided this game because I figured the rules and learning portion would be really long, and everyone would have to learn their role and it would end up being a weird dynamic with no one knowing what anyone else could do.  Turns out I was exactly right.  Individual players have their rules strewn all over other player's boards and each role is different enough that you can't compare who's doing what.  And unless you're willing to read each other role's board, you're just surprised when they do things and pull ahead.

2nd play: Wanted to give it a second chance with 4 of the same players to see if the curve lessened and the game got fun.  Nope.  Still exactly the same experience.

We were a bit underwhelmed by this game at the end of our first 2-player game. Sure, the asymmetry and interaction are great, but we both agreed that there just wasn't much to do. We didn't see much depth beyond the novel concept of extreme asymmetry. 

Now, I do believe that once we get a 4-5 player game going, that opinion will change. Once everyone has someone to 'get' and someone else trying to 'get' them, all with living, breathing strategies, I think the intrigue will step way up. I still see the potential, but for a household that usually plays at 2-player, it's a bit of a letdown right now.

The rule book is alright... It's loaded with holes open for interpretation as far as I can see. Mainly when playing with less than 4 with one of the pre-loaded variants. Our first attempt at playing was a wash after about 2 turns each when we had no clue what the 'other 2' characters were supposed to be doing. After some forum searching I finally got my answers, but how disappointing to take a game out with basic knowledge of the game and still not be able to complete a play through.

Still excited for a 4-5 player game, but if that is a dud too, this may have to be marked for trade or resale.

Man, what a disappointment. Super excited for the theme and assymmetry, but this is a let down. It's a terrible flaw when the game is hard to explain (because of the assymmetry) and the rules aren't written well. Additionally, the roles are assymmetric - but that means some roles take much longer and are much more interesting, so the downtime is killer.

Sad, because I want to like this game a lot. Rules are unclear in a variety of places, and it is very easy for one or two players to be completely locked out of the lategame. Excellent concept, but the game just doesn't hold up.

Really clever idea, not sure how great a game it is once you finish marvelling at the clever interactions.  It is hard to plan your next move as there's a whole lot of take that after your turn. 
I think that the game would benefit from well versed players to cut down on the lengthy playtime.  In future it would be great if mechanics are added to give players opportunities to make decisions during the opponents turns.

The game definitely takes some time to learn and there are absolutely growing pains while people play it incorrectly and get a handle on what their individual strategy and timing should be, but I think that once you get it it's fantastic. It's fun and engaging. The rules are difficult and in some cases not well written. I had to come to the forums to clarify quite a few things.

It's fine.  I can understand why some would like it and some would hate it, but the buy-in on the players' part is definitely high.  The asymmetry - as often noted - is the high point of the game, but also its biggest downfall.  There's just too much going on everywhere to understand anything that you're doing the first time you play, and the experience feels rather weak as everyone bumbles around.  
Some nice ideas for sure, but I wouldn't be sad if I never played it again.

"Owned" in the sense that I've made the pnp version. 

First play (4p.) was kinda dragging on for everyone, the Cave was always furthest from any sort of hope of winning. I like the high level of asymetry, but there is almost no way of planning your move ahead, making turns feel longer than they should. Perhaps this gets better with repeated plays, though it's going to be a tough sell to the family...

Maybe will try with three players next time (13.09.15)

RATING: 8
Played 2X at GenCon.  Will tentatively rate it as an 8. 

Best way to describe it is like Bang/Dead of Winter (variable win conditions) meets D&D dungeon crawler (variable powers), meets a Euro-y style game where you accomplish goals to unlock additional abilities/upgrades for your race.

The game is definitely fiddly with lots of tokens for every race, but overall the gameplay was fun.  As the cave, you play a bit of a kingmaker (renegade) and have to ensure that no one else wins until you can collapse the cave.

Possible caveats: 
***Game may not be 100% balanced, but that could be mitigated by the various handicap cards.  However, I feel like the game should be balanced with equivalent players for a given difficulty setting.

RATING: 5
Was interesting for the first game as we learned how the roles fit together, but quickly lost steam as we found each player's individual game was rather shallow in the things you can do. After 3 games it was dull enough to put it up for sale. Interesting concept and may have been great if each role had more depth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I was really impressed with the originality and ambition of this game, and the full commitment to asymmetric gameplay. The upfront explanation seems daunting but with 4 players it wasn't too bad, and then adding a 5th was fine once the others knew how to play.

My main complaint about the game is that it's very easy for the game to come to the following state: one player (A) has a clear path to victory, and only one other player (B) can stop him, due to the asymmetry in how players can interact with one another. In that case, B's line of play may be completely locked in for 2 or 3 turns (since otherwise A will win). B may yet have a chance of winning himself, but realistically, each turn he spends obstructing A will allow the other players to improve their own chances of winning. The normal dynamic in free-for-all games will lead to a discussion about how the burden of stopping A should be distributed; in this game, that discussion can be (and has been in multiple games of Vast I've played) simply short-circuited because the asymmetry dictates this distribution. This leads to a longer game for all players and a dramatically less fun experience for B.

Increasingly I think the solution to problems like this is the creation of multiple-winner scenarios (e.g. in the recent FFG title "New Angeles", wherein it is possible for all the players but one to win, as well as for no one to win, and anything between those two bookends).

Very fun game. I only managed to play once as the Dragon (and escaped) but it was a great experience. The asymmetric nature is awesome, and shows that every game will be different depending on who is playing who and what people do, the momentary alliances & arguments are great. The art-style was cool and the meeples were a nice touch with the 2nd edition. Looking forward to playing with the miniatures & possibly trying out the extra roles...heck there is a unicorn coming to replace the dragon, and everyone knows the unicorn is the goodest creature ever...looking forward to playing again or buying in the near future.

An absolute monster to teach and requires a few plays for everyone to really understand how to use their roles. That being said the game is a lot of fun and offers a lot of variety.
The barrier to entry for this game as well as its 4-5 player ideal player count has kept this game from hitting the table often.
The game feels like it lacks balance and may need a few house rules added in to make it more enjoyable for some of the characters especially the Knight and the Thief.

Its a game with a nice concept and idea's but it has a few elements I don't like:
It has long downtimes between turns that tend to get really boring, 
The different roles make the game extra hard to learn / follow and losing games just because you don't know all the roles and their victory conditions inside out is not fun when a 5 players play takes all evening...

Interesting approach to a game. A totally asymmetrical cave-diving adventure where everyone has unique goals. I like that it also breaks common tropes. The Knight is a female looking to bring total protection to the kingdom. The Dragon, instead of being a raging tyrant, just wants to wake up and make it to the sun outside. The Cave... is sentient! Fantastic theme.

I would rate it higher, but I find the game lends itself to heavy AP and can drag as a result. Also, with so many unique roles there are a thousand edge cases, many of which I didn't find to be explained clearly. I love that the rulebook is thin, however the game could benefit from an extra book on the side that covers edge cases and how all of the abilities work concisely.

TL;DR Good game, but the multitudes of moving parts mean it doesn't hit the table.

The strength of this game is also its greatest weakness in some ways. The first time I played this game, I was ecstatic, and played it three times that week with different groups, but teaching the game is a daunting task. It hasn't made it to the table since that first week. My game group routinely plays Terra Mystica and Lords of Waterdeep and Eclipse, so they are no strangers to challenging games, but they drag their feet whenever I mention bringing out Vast and the prospect of relearning it prevents them from enthusiasm. That combined with all of the different ways to play make getting the game out for a night of play seem like more of a task than it should be.

The art of the game is engaging, and the sketch quality of the inking really speaks to the nature of the group literally making the board and experience each time. It's a wonderful marriage of aesthetics and play. The components are all well made, and the care the creators took is evident. Again here, though, I wish they hadn't put so many options in the box. It's a little cluttered having the standees AND the wooden pieces and the tiles AND the wooden pieces, and... it makes setup a little confusing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
In vast, each player is a completely different character with their own unique objective, play-style, and abilities. It plays almost like a completely different game for each character, but they interact in such a way that it makes sense and is surprisingly balanced. The Dragon wants to rise and escape the cave, the Knight wants to slay the dragon, the goblins want to kill the knight, the thief just wants to get all the treasure, and the cave (yes it's a playable character) wants to successfully expand itself in a way that doesn't allow anyone else to win before it can collapse itself.

Super fun, great art work, probably the most asymmetrical game I have ever played, and it is balanced enough to work.

Only downside is learning game can be significantly longer than an average game.

A pain in the butt to teach to new players, and at some point one player just said we are going to have to just play to figure this out.  There are definitely a lot of fiddly rules, and actually this felt a lot like a COIN game... but lighter / shorter.  There is definitely a lot to explore in this one, and it is pretty amazing how different each character players... but in the end it forms an eco-system that works pretty well.  I do think this is the type of game though that you have to play pretty frequently to enjoy, and pretty much with the same players.  Interested to try more for sure as I feel like I have only explored one aspect of the game (Knight), and even in that aspect I still have lots to explore to see how I can improve next time.

Vast: Expansion

People keep asking me in the Kickstarter what our future plans look like. I'm debating one of these 2 titles for the next Vast title.

Vast: The Frozen Fear (Vast: The Crystal Cavern Expansion)
The Frozen Fear will feature the Cave map with some new tiles. In addition there will be some mechanics for ice walls and icy floors. The rest of it builds on what is in the Crystal Caverns.

Elf Knight
She is able to fight and cast a spells. Currently she can summon fire elementals to protect her, can create plants to attack and tie up the map, and has the ability to manipulate the Cave.

Goblin War Council
There will be 3 more tribes that interact with the map differently. Instead of tracking population in each tribe there is an overall population score. A Tribe’s strength is based on its position in the War Council and the overall population of the tribes. Monsters are replaced with wolves that just add strength.

Frost Dragon
Searches the Cave slower than the Dragon, but can create defensive ice walls and can cover itself with Ice to keep itself safe from the Elf Knight. He is also lighter so there are mechanics for the Knight pushing the Frost Dragon into lava.

Creepy Cave
Loses the Omens. Uses dice to move around a Rondel to choose actions to take. Some actions spawn lava, grow the Cave, place Treasures, or control monsters in the Cave that limit the other players. Can cause the Cave to collapse by spawning enough lave inside the Cave.

Merchant
Originally this fifth player was going to be the Ghoul but here we are. The Merchant will sell things to the other players to buff them or junk to trick them. Like the Thief when he gets enough money he can exit the map and win.

Vast: The Mysterious Manor (Complete standalone)
This will be a completely new set. The map will be a 7 by 7 Manor. All of the characters will feature some sort of Tableau building.

Paladin
The Paladin is inside the Manor, to purge it of the Spider that lives inside of it. He will have a first in, first out tableau relationship with the tableau with some exceptions. Each card will set his movement, perception, and strength. As his powers grow the tableau will get larger. He can push himself beyond his abilities but it will cost him.

The Orcs
Three (or Four sort of) Orcs will hunt the Paladin down. As they gain gear they will learn new abilities. One Orc is a charger, one makes stealthy attacks, and one is for ranged. The fourth casts spells from off board.

The Spider
She can shift between a larger spider, a bunch of little spiders, or a humanoid caster. Much like the Dragon she will turn in symbols to activate powers. Some cards will stay in her tableau and her form will give her symbols. She wins by stealing treasures, escorting her spiderlings off the maps, and eating.

Super interesting, but the rules complexity aren't worth what is effectively a simple game. You end up with a simple game that has the length and rules complexity of a deep game, which ultimately leaves me not wanting to play again. But, I think the art, presentation, and idea is fantastic.

I really enjoyed playing this game, even though we think some other players played incorrectly.  This is an amazing asymmetrical game with everyone playing very different and having very different end goals.  I also like how the difficulty cards allow you to tailor the game so that those who win easily can be given a higher bar and those who aren't as good a lower one.  I look forward to playing this more and trying the other factions.

When this game went through Kickstarter, I thought it would be a standard dungeon crawler. It is absolutely not that. It's a clever asymmetric game where even though every player is trying to achieve something very different, ever player's mission is incredibly well balanced. In the games I've played multiple players have been ready to win on their next turn when someone finishes the game. For that balance alone this game is top notch.

RATING: 8.5
The designers have managed to create a story out of a seemingly generic fantasy realm. All the roles have personalities that come alive when playing them, and each game against a different role reveals a new story, with new mechanisms, strategies, and tactics, that a player needs to learn. There is a lot of variation in this box.

As it is impossible to plan your turn ahead, players wander off to other tables, then come back only to take their turn and disappear again. I don't blame them. Also the thief seems to have the easiest goal to achieve and when in play, always wins. Lovely idea of a gameplay. But it does not work for me.

This is a very interesting game that packs some truly innovative elements into its design. This is not your daddy's dungeon crawler.

Every disparate element works pretty well together and the different setups with varied player counts surprisingly hang together.

What really keeps this game from being spectacular and a home run is that its five sets of rules that are incredibly hard to grok and teach. Sitting down with a full five and everyone being new will be a miserably long experience. Also, learning the game from a certain role will not help too much the next time you play if you sit down with a different role. It's like re-learning the game anew.

In some ways it kind of comes across as the 504 of dungeon crawlers, although with an extremely smaller scope.

I think this deep asymmetry with entirely different rulesets/turn structures leads to the game feeling more difficult and complicated than it should be. The gameplay is pretty simple at its core, but getting there takes too much time and has too much overhead.

I've still rated this game highly because there's some downright genius here and I did mostly have fun, I'm just not sure down the line it's something I'd reach for and I'm certainly fine if I don't play it again.

This game sounds really cool with the asymmetrical characters and theme. In actuality it feels chaotic and unintuitive. With more plays and familiarity with the character powers I am sure it'll speed things up and still achieve an engaging game. It's not bad and not great, given some options I would likely choose something else to play.

Definitely one of the craziest games I've played given how different the powers are for each player. While that does make it rough to teach most gamers, I imagine many will be willing to get into it and just play, but it does take one person who knows all of the player powers at least a little bit to keep the game going. I've played it three times now (dragon, cave, and knight) all are very different and that brings some initial enjoyment but then the game drags when you have a really quick turn and there's nothing to do on your turn. The hardest part is understanding what everyone else needs to do to win the game as a few times I made a sub-optimal moves that were benefiting others more than me even though it was still helping me win. The art style is whimsical and fun to me which is a plus for me to get into and enjoy a fantasy game. Vast is a very unique game and one I would be happy to play but don't see a need to own it.

Starting this at a hopeful 8.5 after a couple plays.  It's been awhile since I've been truly overwhelmed by a design. Less in the sense of being charmed by a specific mechanism or impressed with its scope. No, I just mean overwhelmed. There are just so many parts! That this game has become a hit I think is a testament to its novelty and its fine art direction more than its gameplay. I don't mean that as a slam at all. From what I've seen the gameplay is brilliant so far and looks to really be something special. But this game is HARD. It's got a sheer cliff for a learning curve and players should expect 4-5 games of play before they begin to grasp the strategy. That puts us well into COIN/Eklund territory, which is a good place to be, but I wonder how many players will scratch their heads and think about turning around once they get a sense of what the road forward looks like.   

My advice, like a COIN, if you have a group interested in exploring one of the most interesting game spaces of the year over a few months, you probably can't do better than Vast. I'll need about a dozen plays before I feel comfortable reviewing the game, but I think this could be something really special.  A heavy and truly interesting fantasy game that doesn't suffer from boring interactions and static game-play (Talisman et al.) nor overly procedure systems mastery (mage knight, magic realm).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Bought a copy of the first printing from Patrick Leder himself at Gencon and loved it ever since. Everything about it just appeals to me: the aesthetics and the interactions is creates through the different roles.

To sum it up: the Knight must slay the Dragon, the Goblins must slay the Knight, the Dragon must wake up and leave the cave, the Cave must grow until it collapses, and the Thief must stash treasure to break an undying curse. Each role plays differently and can interact with each other role in their own unique way. This is why the game is often advertised as asymmetrical.

However, for all the praise I've given it just now the rules can be daunting and difficult to navigate for an entire group of new players. This is getting fixed in the second printing.

Also, like all free-for-all games, you can occasionally run into "Munchkin Syndrome" where everyone's efforts turn from progressing towards their own objective to preventing others from reaching theirs. This is indirectly discouraged by making certain interactions much more resource intensive; for example, to land a guaranteed kill on the Thief, the Dragon must spend 3 power cards from their hand.

Highly recommended, especially with 3 new roles, promos, and a second printing coming in August 2017.

Vast seemed very fun but I don't know if I like it? I've had it for almost 2 years and it's received a single play. Perhaps it's uniqueness has made it less of an easy choice for a game day/night.

RATING: 7.5
The draw here is the asymmetricality. Each role plays entirely differently from the other roles. It's a neat little juggling act that certainly adds replayability ... IF you buy into the notion that all the roles are perfectly balanced. And I'm not sure they are. In my 5-player game, the cave absolutely rolled us, and I'd be hard pressed to figure out what we could have done differently to stop it.

Now if we were playing with fewer players, that would have changed victory conditions and things might have been different. That's another neat aspect of the game: Remove a player and suddenly another player has to win in an entirely different way. Clever!

Less exciting is the game's pace of play. Players pretty much have to wait to see what everyone else is doing before forming their plan of attack. This slows the game down quite a bit. It took us almost two hours to complete our 5-player game, and a lot of that was downtime where somebody is just staring at their cards and/or player board, trying to figure out what to do.

I'd return to "Vast" for sure if somebody wanted to play it. I'm not sure I'd suggest it as a game to play myself, however. Maybe the upcoming "Root" will be the Patrick Leder asymmetrical design that nails it. "Vast" comes close, but the jagged edges of complexity slow the proceedings down a bit too much to call this a true winner.

Oh god such an engaging concept. It brought me from the beginning. Sadly with such a high expectation it falls a bit flat.
I still in love with the asymmetrical gameplay, with the roles and everything what made me to back this on Kickstarter but the rule explanation is so long if you play with new people, the complexity of the roles are very very different. If thee would be a group were everyone experienced player with Vast then this can be what I wanted to see. After a few plays I probably wouldn't play this with newbies.

Had to lower from 8 to 7:
enormous time to setup and explain the rules to every single time. Also I know we can adjust the game with difficulty levels but every game were decided between the Thief and the Dragon while the Cave and the Knight had no chance. Bigger issue: the knight player had no fun at all.

I don't know why I'm so excited about this. It's probably the asymmetry and the interlocking subsystems. Backed and backed, and if they make good on their promise of January 2016, oh boy.

Not sure how I feel about the change name, but oh well. If the game's the same as I'm seeing in the amazing rules...

This game is everything I ever wanted from an asymmetrical game with one caveat: it has to be played by four, or possibly five, players. Anything less and it feels a bit contrived: at four, it's an amazing experience.

This rating is based on one playthrough, but it was a miserable experience.  Each player has a different role, and their own mechanics are ill-defined and confusing.  Since your role is different from everyone else, good luck asking anyone else for comprehension.  New players have so much trouble figuring out what they can do that they don't have the brainpower to fully comprehend what other players can do.  Our game ended when the one player who played before, playing as the cave, set off a chain of moves that (a) we didn't know he could do and (b) that we had no way to stop, sealing him an out-of-nowhere victory.

This game might be good with a table full of hardcore gamers who have played the game before and understand their and everyone else's powers.  It's an interesting experiment in wildly assymetric gameplay rules, roles and objectives.  However, at least for new players, it doesn't translate into a good one.

Each character has their own, very different and interesting mechanics.  However, the downtime between turns is quite long, at least when first playing the game.

RATING: 5
Fascinating and intriguing design, more asymmetric than nearly any other board game I can think of offhand. There's tons of neat stuff here, but also some troubles:

 * It seems to want players who are willing to push for even a tiny chance of victory over "keep another player from winning" - partly because over-defensive turtling just hands a drawn-out eventual victory to the Cave; partly because it's entirely possible for a player to seem (correctly or not) like they're totally out of the running, and if they're not willing to keep taking long-shots, the game can go bad places.
 * The rules badly need some additional work - some wording is very ambiguous [i](Thief: "end of movement" = "end of [u]all[/u] movement or end of [u]any[/u] movement?)[/i], information a player might need is in another character's rules [i](Goblins: how Ambushes work.)[/i], there are places where information is on a playmat but not in the rules [i](Goblins: special tribe actions are only usable when Revealed)[/i], and some extremely core/basic rules were simply omitted [i](Knight: you're obliged to reveal dark tiles when you enter them)[/i], probably because they seemed obvious.
 * Early plays probably ought to be done with 1-3 players to limit downtime and rules-interactions, unless you have a veteran present to answer questions. We did 5p, which was a mistake.

Despite all this, I'd enjoy trying it again - ideally with 2-3p, or if it had to be 4p then without the Thief.

EDIT: Tried 3p Knight/Goblin/Dragon. It was way faster - but also much less fun. This play revealed that the Knight can have real bootstrapping issues; several side quests are extremely difficult to complete until you have at least 3-4 cubes available, and if you're not able to reach treasures/crystals with your limited early-game move + explore, you have to slog through many turns of exploration to earn those 3rd and 4th cubes. Hope the Goblins don't pick up the "-5 Grit" Monster or the Poison!

Fairly simplistic strategically wise but an interesting experiment in game design. Breadth of rules is wide but I wonder if there really is replayability and adequate pay off in depth. This is one design where I feel the asymmetry might be too stark to provide for creative play since the faction itself determines how best to play the game. For now, it is an okay game that I would try again.

This is an intriguing game - extremely asymmetric play with up to 5 unique characters/play styles. Lots of variation - feels very fresh. Now, with all the variation, comes one of its problems - it is somewhat more difficult to bring to the table with a lighter gaming group as you are having to teach several different sets of rules. Also, while I at first liked the brevity of the manual - I find some of the rules fall through the cracks and I need to look things up on BGG for the finer points.

Some things that could be improved
- too many variations in rules - maybe an app that indicated the appropriate rules for a given game combination (trimmed out unnecessary rules for a given combination)
- setup time (including re-reading what your current character was capable of) was long - app might help with that too
- while some things are tracked, others are not and need to be tracked mentally - more counters would have been useful (or the use of tracks)
- various actions were useless if a given character type was not being used. A symbology indicating what a given card/action was used against may have been handy to narrow down which actions a player needed to be familiar with (or could remove cards at the start of the game that did nothing).

The idea behind the game is awesome, the actual gameplay is not. It felt quite long and repetitive with lots of downtime with five players. Having the cave shifting tiles around so the other players couldn't win for a couple of turns might be fun for the cave player but not really for anyone else.

Played twice, better second time around but still not a game I'd want to play again. The rules being very vague didn't help either.

The greatest strength of this is also it's greatest weakness, five different roles, means five rule explanations, put another way it's difficult to teach: I'd rather teach brass from the rule book to several different groups than try to teach this again. I wish I had a group who were willing to play the same game over and over to explore the asymmetry.Though I am not sure the game itself is good enough to warrant that amount of time. There's some really great ideas at play here, as it is I am happy to be rid of it.

Addendum: very happy.

Assymetrical gameplay? Count me in. Love games where you feel different from other pkayers. My biggest complaints are 1)Really hard to teach. If everyone is new you could have to teach 4 different players different rules. The time it takes to teach can turn players off.
2) Too long at 5 players. I haven't played 4 but that could be a problem for it as well. 
3) Theif feels too easy to win with.

Beside these issues this game is a hit for me.

Preordered a copy for Spring 2017 delivery, which is something I almost never do.   The endgame might suffer from the Munchkin or Kill Doctor Lucky syndrome, so it is probably best played with an adventure game mindset.   Very creative and original design - need more games like this.  I hope it does very well for the designers/publisher.

The rules are not terribly clean.   The second printing has more clarifications, but it is still quite verbose and lacking in non-trivial examples.   

It is worth mentioning how good the art is.   Somewhere between Dragon's Lair and Mouseguard, and just as good as those.   Really adds a ton of flavor to the game.

In a hobby with so many games focused on hyper-efficiency, it’s refreshing to play something that’s about being creative. And devious (see: Emerald, A Study In).

They set out with an ambitious goal here – to make asymmetrical powers that are interrelated in ways that make players frenemies. And they totally nailed it. The game feels extremely well balanced (with one caveat). As to the rules, they were much easier than I had expected. Each role has a two-sided rules sheet that tells them all they need to know. We found the rules got out of the way fairly quickly and we were able to get into the richness of the interactions.

Everything starts with the Knight who explores the dungeon. He wants to find and kill the Dragon. The Goblins want to kill the Knight. The Dragon needs to eat Goblins to wake up and escape before the Knight kills him. The Thief wants to collect treasure from the map and also perhaps by pickpocketing the Knight. The Cave wants all that to take a long time such that he can collapse on all of them and win. It’s wonderfully interconnected and kept us all truly playing against each other and not some soulless action board. 

My only caveat is that we played twice with the Thief and the experience felt substantially different such that I’d suggest the Thief is only played with experienced players. The Cave and the Knight are allies because the Cave wants the Knight to explore all the tiles so he can start collapsing. Without the Thief in play, the Cave helps the Knight find treasure. With the Thief around, the Cave has to worry about the Thief – who takes their turn before the Knight – snatching the treasure up first. The Knight without the Thief felt very powerful and then quite nerfed with him. I don’t think anything is OP just that players are better off learning the other four roles before layering in the Thief IMO.

I already ordered a copy off the BGG marketplace as I can see a lot of lively sessions with this one. Kind of reminds me of Chaos in the Old World for having gameplay that makes you think but engenders a lot of conversation and laughter as well.

UPDATE: I still like the game very much but I’ve found it divisive among my two regular groups. People need to like it enough to want to play repeatedly and learn all the roles because without a well-balanced table, the experience can fall flat. In two recent games, the Knight went off exploring the cave and kinda forgot about the Dragon. The Dragon and the Cave placed treasure within easy reach of the Thief. These kinds of suboptimal play suck the tension out of the experience. Fortunately, I have a subset of friends who enjoy the experience enough that I should still get some regular play out of it. 

***RULE UPDATES***

1. Moving a player outside their turn, via Giant Bats, Wisp, Dragon Powers, a Collapsing tile, etc, has now been standardized:
* a. Players can't be moved onto/through a tile they couldn't using their normal movement (i.e. only Underground Dragon can be moved through walls, Knight/Surfaced Dragon can't be moved onto/through Dark Tiles).
* b. Players can't be moved onto/through a tile with another player.
* c. Knight must stop if moved onto an Event token.
Note: Tiles containing tokens other than Event tokens or Players no longer block Wisp movement.
[Previously: each method followed different rules]

2. Revealed Goblins may now Move before using their Special Action.
[Previously: Goblins could not move before using Special Action, but could before doing anything else]

3. Goblins lose 1 Population when first entering Lake (similar to when entering River). After that, normal "Lit" tile loss occurs.
[Previously: There was no damage when entering Lake]

RATING: 8.5
[b]The theme:[/b] The theme of Vast is not that interesting to me - generic fantasy theme of knight coming to kill dragon, goblins angry at knight for lighting the cavern up and thief coming to steal dragon's treasure. Yawn! However, it is very well integrated into the mechanisms of the game. The dragon takes some time to wake up as he was asleep for a few hundred years. The knight can't kill the dragon as effectively when he is asleep (and therefore on a different level). The goblins are hurt by lighted rooms. The cave is just messing with everyone :D And I haven't played with the thief yet but I am sure it will also be very thematic.

[b]The components:[/b] Well, let's just put it out there. I don't like the artstyle they chose. I think it is just plain ugly. But I have to acknowledge that it is very consistent throughout the whole game, so that is a good thing (I guess :D). And it is not that the components are badly produced or anything, I just don't like them :)

[b]The fun:[/b] Oh, so much fun! Our (so far) one game was decided in the very last round. If I (as dragon) would have drawn one more wing card, I could have escaped. If the goblins drew something else, they could have killed the knight. If the knight have rolled one hit, he would have killed the poor dragon. So the cave won in the end, but it was so exciting! None of us walked away feeling sour or like he got the short end of a stick.

[b]The gameplay:[/b] What they said about the true asymmetry of this game is true. Is it not that every role has different abilities and goals, they have different round structures! For this, it is one of the most unique games I have ever played. Yes, it has a very steep learning curve and experienced players have it much easier than newbies. But the designers knew this and made 5! difficulty levels for each role. There are also variants for each role. The playtime is not terrible and will get better with experience. Just an amazing game.

RATING: 4
Overall, this was a very interestng concept.  I liked the idea of it, the asymetry, the characters themselves.

The problems with it, though, are a few:
- if someone plays poorly, the player that could most be affected by them likely has a better chance at victory
- it requires a number of plays using same character to get an idea of how to play them to win
- since everyone can kind of mess around with everyone else, you end up with the problem of semi-coop games in that someone will do what is best for them and force the hand of the other players to prevent someone else from winning

In our one game of this I was the Thief.  I spent a couple of turns getting a treasure out.  I then decided to see if I could get 2 treasures out in one shot, however they were more than my maximum movement away, in that once I got them I'd need 2 moves to get them out.  A quick attack from another player and I was back at the start 2 turns away from them.

I think that I'd like to play again at some point, but it dragged on a lot, and I'd want to play with exactly the same players in the same roles.

What I like about Vast: the attempt to make an extremely asymmetric game; the artwork; the treatment of the deluxe components; and most especially this idea: the Cave has to actually help the other players survive so that they don't win the game by being able to kill each other off, while giving the Cave enough time to collapse and kill them all. Brilliant! A wonderful idea that I hope I see used in another game at some point. Other than those points, I can't say I really enjoyed Vast. For new players, the asymmetry means that you are focused so much on learning your own faction that you don't really keep mind of what other players need to do to win (other than their basic objective). This means there's not a lot of countering you're going to intuitively do until you're familiar with the game. That's a minor point, however, as there are fans of this system who will want to explore it further. Maybe this was just an issue with the Dragon (I suspect 'not' for my personal tastes) but the game from the Dragon's position was kinda boring. Draw cards, look up the special powers you can use that turn and then use them. A lot of obvious choices. A lot of my opponents shutting my options down based on what other characters did in turns before.  (How can I kill goblins if they keep going into hiding?) And the downtime means you're waiting a long time to do several boring things before having to wait again for your turn. The game just doesn't create anything interesting. I'll admit: it's unique, a cool perspective on design and I don't think its fans are crazy for loving it. But for my tastes, there's just not enough meat here to really enjoy something substantial, and still it manages to come off as an extremely overwrought game. I wish somehow it felt a little more "cohesive" but that would have watered down the asymmetry. So considering there's fans, I'm okay with it being what it is. Just wish I liked it more as I really dig the concept.

Oryginalna mechanik, asymetryczność na 5 ról, sporo możliwości. Minusem może być konieczność analizowania wybranej/wylosowanej roli przed rozgrywką, co może zabrać dosyć sporo czasu. Na pewno nie jest to szybka gra, wymaga czasu i przemyślenia, nie da się uciec przed pytaniami "co możesz mi zrobić?". Niezwykle oryginalna i ciekawa pozycja, interesujące grafiki, świetna jakość wykonania (najgrubsze planszetki graczy, jakie widziałam!). Myślę, że będzie trzeba zagrać po parę partii każdą z ról, by móc w pełni ocenić samą grę i jej balans, ale pierwsze wrażenia są zdecydowanie pozytywne (wygrała Jaskinia).

Fully Asymmetric game that plays very well. The starting setup of Knight > Dragon > Goblins > Knight, rock paper scissors was cool. The 4th player, the cave, tried to slow down everyone and win from time (collapsing the cave). We didn't play with the 5th player, thief, but he also seems to mess with all players

The pros is the game plays fast once everyone knows the rules. The balance seems pretty good but the dragon does seem a little easier. Knight has to be really on top of him and both Cave/Goblins have a lot to manage

The con is that the game is hard to learn/explain since every character is playing the game differently. Best experience is to have the group prepick their races and learn them (very nice player aid for each) and also replay the game a few times.

I could see this game being pretty great in the right groups, the main barrier are the rules, so if you can get pass that then there are a lot of different modes/variants you could play and there is a ton of replayability here. I'm also not a big fan of games that mostly require 1 person to keep the other in check since that can lead to a person running away with the game if someone is new to the game or doesn't want to play ball (because they are already losing or something)

RATING: 7
Incredible when it all works but a game that requires a lot of buy in from a group willing to play it regularly enough for everyone to learn the roles.

You really need the full set of players and each player relies on the others understanding their own character.  If even one player is playing their role poorly it sabotages other player's ability to play.  Haven't had a satisfying game yet since hitting the right number and repeat players just doesn't happen often enough.

Tentative rating.

Love this game, and I love the art, but I need to find the time to sit down with this one because this is a very ambitious box with a lot of different asymmetrical combinations.

I have played it a couple of times and enjoyed it.  I recommend sticking with the main characters of dragon, goblins, and knight, unless you have more people.  First game I played was cave, thief, dragon and it didn't quite work (you have to keep the rock, paper scissor, thing going or it doesn't relly work)

But Knight, goblins, dragon?  Awesome!  I really want to play a full game with a cave player but I haven't yet.

The one drawback of the game is the prospect of teaching it - the teacher needs to know all the rules for each of the players and even then, each of the players needs to know something about how everyone else plays or they can't really make effective decisions.

This looks fantastic ... but ...

I'm gonna be honest, I am not the best at translating game rulebooks into actual comprehension. With a game like this it feels like trying to teach myself would be a BAD idea, with a high risk of my learning the rules incorrectly and then having a devil of a time unlearning them. My usual standby, grabbing a video game version and learning from that, doesn't work because there isn't one.

Unfortunately, of the how-to videos I was able to find, one was rambling and hard to follow, one was so quiet I couldn't hear it (and according to the comments it was also wrong), and the rest were more about "unboxing" than teaching.

Love to hear what people have to suggest. :/

Vast is a totally asymmetric game, since different roles have totally different mechanics that support their style of play. 

At the core there are three which are a rock, paper and scissors, and a fourth, the Cave, which will try to slow each one down. 

This is a game that requires careful play and, above all, experience. The game won't shed its fun factor if you don't know what you're doing, and I expect that for the first couple of games this is exactly what will happen. 

It has some significant downtime so do not invite at the table who is AP prone, or your fun will free fall before the end of the game. 

The most difficult role to play is the Cave, the others have a rough idea of what they've got to do and how to do it. Give the Cave to the most experienced player. 

As for now my rating is only temporary.

When you take a series of relatively simple one-way interactions (A fights B, B fights C, etc.) and shackle them all to a multiplayer euro, you end up with this--an overlong, unengaging, limited player-interaction, arbitrary-feeling Kill Doctor Lucky problem. You either internalize everyone's minigame, in which case the game devolves into unfun politics (i.e., whining) that is vastly more complicated than it's worth; or you don't, and everything seems totally random and pointless.

It's hard to weigh how I feel about the design of this game compared to how it plays. The design is brilliant, but did I have fun? After two plays as the Dragon, I can say, "I think so?" The Goblins seemed fun, but they never seemed to be doing much of anything. The Thief was either way too good, or really bad in each game. I liked the hand management factor of playing the Dragon, but I also felt stymied a lot of the time. The Cave role is one of the coolest things about this game, can't wait to play it. And the Knight seemed like a very theme-y experience. More than many games, this one is going to take several spins before I really know how I feel about it. For now it gets a 7. My game group all seemed to enjoy it in any case, so that bodes well.

Vast was on the table when we first arrived at Jordal-Con 2016 and from that first glance of this game's attractive components, I knew I had to give it a try. I was not disappointed! I played as the cave but what amazed me the most about this high interaction game was that each of the game's five characters (knight, goblins, dragon, cave, and thief) play completely different. As the cave, I was trying to expand as quickly as possible so I could then collapse on everyone else and win, but each of the other four players had not only unique win conditions but totally unique play styles as well. 

The thief was playing a fast paced game of ditch and run, the knight was trying to level up to kill the dragon, the goblins were trying to ambush and kill the knight, while the dragon was simply trying to wake up, recover what it had lost during is long hibernation, and get the neck out of the infernal cave before anyone could detain him.

The game requires a bit of setup and has a definite learning curve, but once things start rolling, everything falls into place rather smoothly and since there is quite a bit of player interaction, waiting for your next turn is not monotonous -- you'll be strategizing, cursing the boneheaded (from your viewpoint) decisions of your fellow players, and offering plenty of self-serving suggestions to the other factions while you wait for your time in the spotlight to come back around.

And if all that wasn't enough, each of the five sides of the game come with their own unique AI to automate their turns for situations when you don't have five people available to play. In fact, the game is designed to play just fine solo with whichever character the player chooses to play.

This is one of the most creative games I've seen in a long time and i can see it fast becoming a staple and a favorite to many gaming groups.

I have a soft spot for asymmetric games . . . and this is one of the more involved designs in the category that I have tried.  The design felt well conceived and engineered.  The most challenging part of the game is that it clearly relies on having multiple players of equal skill (and equal knowledge of the game / character roles and abilities) to keep each other in check.  So . . . it is going to take a play or three to get everyone up to speed on this one.

As of 8/21/17, I've only played this game twice, but I loved it right away when I tested it at GenCon this year. It's a 3 - 5 player game, but as some of the comments have said, it seems to be at its best* when you play with 4 or 5 players. (*seems to be the most balanced and the most enjoyable for all players) The game forces players to work together because, if they don't, then one player tends to run away with the game. However, only one player can win. These fleeting alliances, usually not spoken aloud, make this game very fun and unique! A word of warning, this game is rather complex to learn because every role is very different than the rest. If all the players are new then each one is so focused on their own board that they can't really help any others. In fact, only if somebody has played every kind of player (likely a couple times each) would I count on them to be able to help in any meaningful way during play.

This is my favorite new game in years. I backed it on kickstarter.

This is the kind of game that is best played many many times with the same core group of players. Then each player can really get to know how the different roles interact, especially considering the number of variants available.

I also particularly like how there are built in difficulty cards for each role. This makes it so that you can effectively play new players against experienced players while still having a fun experience for everyone (where each player can still legitimately win!)

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2017)

I was keen to play Vast: The Crystal Caverns, it seemed like a great game with a great concept, but after playing it, it was a bit of a disappointment.

The rules for the game aren’t very complex, but as each player plays differently, the explanation is long  (around 30 minutes) and boring (because you can only explain to one player at a time). This is a weakness of the game. Playtime is also very variable, it depends if a player will reach his goal or not. In any case it surpasses the 90 minute mark easily.

The game´s components are from okay to good. The art is pretty good.

Love the theme.

The idea behind the game is fascinating, each player is trying to win the game by meeting different criteria, so all players need to balance each other until a player wins. I love the idea of the game, but this very mechanism ensures you will have a long game and it encourages "take that" and "attack the leader" (I´m not fond of those mechanisms).

Vast: The Crystal Caverns’ decisions are not very complex, in fact the options you have available are rather clear each turn. I played with the Goblins and it was pretty straightforward once I understood the rules. The best option was always apparent to me. I’m not sure if the other roles are the same, but from my LIMITED perspective the Dragon is very easy to handle as well. The Knight has to decide how to distribute his cubes each turn, so it is a bit harder to handle it, but not by much. Perhaps the Cave player has the greatest difficulty to win. We didn’t play with the thief. 

I don´t think all the roles are perfectly balanced and I’m also worried about king making, if a player doesn’t plays his best, another player will be enormously benefited.

Best with 4 fast players. I wouldn’t want to play with 5 players. The downtime is too much for me and it begins to feel very repetitive.

There is considerable luck with the cards for the goblins, the tiles for all players, the die of the dragon, but I´m not sure if it is too much. My gut feeling says it isn’t, but I need more plays to verify.

In the player aid for the goblins, it says you can move and then you can execute and action per tribe, that implies that you can move and then reveal and that’s not the case. What I’m trying to say is that it is confusing and could be a lot clearer and better redacted and organized. I didn’t read the rules of the game, but from my (limited) perspective they are confusing in some parts.

Bottom line, Vast: The Crystal Caverns is a thematic experience and I love the games concept, however, it takes a long time to explain so my desire to teach the game isn’t high. The decisions aren’t very complex, the complexity comes from the rules. I already sold my copy of the game but only because a friend really wanted it, perhaps I will buy the game again because I definitively need more plays to gauge it better and I want to play other roles. Novel game.

There is a really good game in here somewhere.  It's just buried under waaaay too many fiddly rules and unnecessary complexity.  Damn....such a cool a idea and structure for a game though.

RATING: 6
I like the part, that is is asymetrical and with a great twist to the classic dungeon story. First part of the game is a bit slow. Middle part works great and is real balanced. End game is a bit boring, as it is more a kingmaker game, than you actually win on your own strategy.

RATING: 3
It could have been the table but there's too much asymmetry going on here, and lots of figuring out what each of the five characters does, and then optimizing, leading to too much down time for what the game attempts to do.  Not sure there's enough sustain to the game to get to the point where sufficient plays would be achieved to reach a decent speed of play.

While American and European-inspired designs borrow heavily from each other these days, this is the first time I have seen those values combined in a way that creates an experience that, fundamentally, doesn't feel like it comes from either school - while intellectually I know it is deeply tied to both. Vast moves beyond just combining mechanics and starts to realize the promise of connecting the American/European dots of gaming history to create an actual new experience.

Vast is a different game for every player at the table. For the Knight, it is a game of exploration and conquest. For the Goblins, a skirmish game of abstract positioning. For the Dragon, an escape puzzle. For the Cave, an aggressive tile-layer. For the Thief, a game of stealth and avoidance. Every player operates under a drastically different rule set and turn structure. Each players' win condition is uniquely tied directly or indirectly to every other players' win conditions, which makes for a highly interactive game in the tight confines of the caverns. The balance the designers have achieved within this inherent asymmetry is truly remarkable. The tension comes on all sides - not only do you need to aggressively go after your objective, but other players' objectives run right through you and you need to be ready to stand ground. There's a balance there that calls for careful planning and risk management on every turn.

There are some downsides to the game, most notably how challenging it is to learn and teach every different rule set. Even after you understand the rules, it is still challenging to understand how to meet your goals while defending yourself from players who are operating entirely different from you - so the game can be somewhat plodding in its pace. The 60-90 minutes on the box assumes a table of players who all know the game well and know what they are doing. 3 hours for a first game with teaching is probably realistic. The rule book phrasing is sometimes gratuitously opaque and a full breakdown of game cards and their abilities would have been welcomed. I think improvements were made for the 2nd printing, but they did not go far enough. All of these are quibbles, though. The game is engaging in spite of its pace and the designers are active on BGG with clarifications. The production quality for the 2nd printing is high and the wooden bits a welcomed addition.

The asymmetrical gameplay of Vast is actually a cool idea and can be a fun concept.  I like the IDEA of it.  Unfortunately, this is the kind of game you need to dedicate yourself to playing ALOT, getting to know each individual role inside and out, and then finding a group of people who also care about playing this ALOT and knowing all the roles.  Once you find enough people who are diehards about this game, then I think you'd have a pretty fun session playing this.  

For me, I don't mind playing it necessarily, but I would also be happy to never play it again.  All 3 games I've played so far were chaotic in a bad way, in part because I didn't fully understand the powers and abilities of the other roles I was against.  So my strategy that I thought was great, turned out to not be and it was only because I didn't know things like "oh, the Cave can actually remove Sloth cubes from my track that I worked so hard to build".  

I'm sure this is awesome with a group of people who all know all the roles inside and out.  But you'd have to be really really into this game to have that, and I'm just not into it enough to care to know all the roles.

I'm pretty excited about the balance challenge that this game proposes and it's variably player powers and objectives.

This game is a lot of fun, but it has a huge learning curve due to the asymmetric gameplay. If you have a group of players who already know how all the roles function, it's an absolute blast. Player who do not know how all the roles function, however, are at a serious disadvantage -- both in learning their own preferred strategy and in figuring out how to deal with the other players' strategies.

Really cool asymmetric design.  I like how the Cave player needs to keep any of the others from being a runaway leader; a skilled Cave player should be able to keep the game close and interesting to the end.

Because of the uniqueness of the roles though, teaching time seems like it would be really long.  (Consider that "how to play" Youtube videos for Vast are often split into different vidoes!)

Not sure this will ever hit my table.

Vast takes you and your friends into the torch light of a classic cave-crawling adventure, built on the concept of total asymmetry. Gone are days of the merry band of travelers fighting off evil. In Vast, you will become part of a new legend... Any part you wish!

Play as the classic, daring Knight, the chaotic Goblin horde, the colossal, greedy Dragon, or even the Cave itself — powerful, brooding, and intent on crushing the living things that dare to disturb its gloomy depths. Each role has its own powers, pieces, and paths to victory...and there can be only one winner.

A bugger to teach because of the nature of the different roles, not backed up by the clearest of rule books. Nevertheless, an engaging game with some interesting choices to be made.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Really enjoyed my first play as the Cave and seeing how the different factions work so very differently. I can see how teaching this game could be a nightmare, but if you have a regular group this could be quite entertaining if people invest the time to learn the factions and how they play. This feels quite innovative within modern gaming focusing a game around totally different factions who have not even one similar ability.

There is probably a very interesting, very fun game of asymmetrical play here, but we only touched on it because most of our time was spent figuring out the absolutely abysmal rulebook. Kickstarter people, please get someone who edits for a living to edit your rulebooks, and please do blind playtesting with those rulebooks and you'll save yourself a lot of embarrassment. The asymmetrical rules are nice, but because of them it's hard to play well the first time. In our game the Cave won one turn before I (Dragon) would have. I didn't know how the Cave worked, otherwise I could have prevented this. Now I know. 

Beyond the rules, the game itself could have used some editing. It's extremely fiddly and fussy, much more than the theme and presentation would have you believe.

You get 5 different mini-games in a box, and you can play each separately if you want, but that'll be a very flat experience. However as you mix more player roles (games) together, you'll notice a significant positive difference, and I've only played the game with 3 players or less.

First Impressions: A very intricate puzzle, where each role interplays with one another. The decisions are simple and it is very necessary to actively be engaged while the other players are taking their turns.

Pros
- An asymmetric game where everyone plays a unique role in the game.
- Every player has decisions that mutually interplay with each other.
- Decisions tangibly impact other players and further your goals.
- Each player has a clearly defined set of goals.

Cons
- I do not think this game has enough heft to satisfy gamers who are looking for a very complex puzzle, after understanding the basic interactions between players the magic of the puzzle is lost.
- Lots of caveats, exceptions, and probably errata.

Each player has a radically unique role and rule set. Each role's rules fit on a double-sided page, but play with players who can learn from the page themselves (or at most one player who needs to be taught) and can quickly summarize their goals and abilities for the other players, or the teaching process will be a hugely frustrating mess.

Stick to 4 or 5 players for the "real" experience; the low-player-count modes are technically functional but lose the balancing interplay at the heart of the game.

Wow. Hard to describe how brutal this gaming experience was. I love asynchronous 
games and dungeon themed games usually. The group I played with also does. We were all set for enjoying this game and then saw how fiddly, slow paced due to the rules, yet so simple and unfun this was. None of us enjoyed it, from the Knight who had a brutal game and never touched the dragon, to the thief who won, the goblins who were 2 hits from winning, the dragon who was awake, everyone had a miserable time. The owner even posted to sell the game on facebook mid-way. And the artwork is childish too.

I cannot get over how well balances this game is. Every time we play it's always so close to see who wins! It is simple to play once you get your head around each of the characters (each is basically a different game and different set of rules), and you cannto help but marvel at how much effort went into designing such a fun, elegant, exciting, challenging, and just different game. Definitely staying in my collection, and I cannot wait to play it again. And again. And again.

An interesting asymmetric game.  However, many of the player interactions feel unfun or disruptive.  For example, the only way for the cave to win is by throwing roadblocks between all of the players or draining each players equivalent of levels. It ended up being incredibly frustrating for half of the players.

Sold with 3D Printed Standees / Crystals / Chests / Vaults via BGG 11/8/16 for $80

Concluded that the game just lost too much at 2 player.  It's a great 4 player game, but we don't have many people who can play this rule-heavy of a game.

---

Bought direct from ledergames 8/19/16.

I love the complete asymmetry between all 5 roles.  The knight has a fun sense of progression with her "experience points" in the form of grit.  The dragon has a nice snowballing effect, as he accumulates a bigger and bigger hand size.  The thief has some interesting abilities, allowing him to be a thorn in just about everybody's side.  The goblins are my least favorite, but still interesting to manage.  The biggest surprise was the cave.  There's something oddly satisfying about watching the knight come within 1 space of her final objective and flinging her back 14 spaces and sealing her off with a wall.

However, many of the roles (thief and goblin mostly) seem to lose quite a bit in solo and 2-player, as many of their abilities are really meant for higher player counts.

The production quality in certain areas is great - nice thick tiles and a beautiful, strong box.  However, in other areas, it's pretty lacking.  The player aids are flimsy copies of pages from the manual and need to be laminated for any lasting power.  The cards are fairly poor quality.  I did not like the wooden meeples for the characters for the most part.  I also felt like the goblin discs should've been much thicker than they were. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Incredibly original idea - in practice, the game seemed to have a lot of downtime as each of the five roles has a lot of fiddly rules to deal with. May get faster with more experience. Also, for all the time it takes to learn the rules and all the downtime, you find yourself playing a not very deep, bash the leader, take that game. The art, except for the player boards, is unexceptional.

RATING: 7.5
Really intrigued by this game.  Has fantastic art, and the assymetric play means that, like a COIN game, there is alot to be explored, and an initial investment of time for players to get familiar with the role that they have in the game.

It is rated pretty heavy on BGG, but I don't think the gameplay is too complex.  I certainly got the hang of the Dragon pretty quickly.  Keen to play again.

ok this game is unique but that does not make it a good game. 
This game reminds me of the game 504, its unique and a fantastic game will use its core idea in the future but this game is not good (or not for me)

ill write a longer review to flush out my thoughts but some some of the things i really didnt like
- rules overhead is insane for this light of game.who want to teach this to new players?
- the player downtime is very long for this light of game 
- everyone need to police 1 other player so the winner is basically the one who failed policing the other player (unless your the cave where you need to police everyone all the time making you essentially the kingmaker if you dont win)
- this game is all tactics, and honestly there are no really hard decisions in this game. Its just to light for me.

RATING: 7
This is 5 games at once, each faction has a totally separate way of playing. After only one play it is difficult to tell whether it is balanced or not, but it seemed like everyone except the cave could've won around the same time.

Took a long time to learn and figure out the point of everything but got fun once we got into our stride. Would definitely go back for more.

This is a brilliantly designed, asymmetrical game that offers a whole new spin on the classic fantasy dungeon game. It can be a little tough to teach and it will only be after your first whole game that you truly understand what your character was supposed to be doing, but you will still have fun with it and it only gets better from there.

[b]2016-09-24 7.5[/b] 2x 2p, 1x 4p:
Difficult to rate this one. 2p game (Knight v Dragon) presents a lot of random card draws on events, treasures, and cave tiles. The scenario is still fun and tense, but both players can get slightly frustrated by the random draw sometimes. 4p game, however, brings the best out of this ingenious design. Interaction between characters are highly thematic and power seems to be well-balanced in that 1 play. The unfortunate downsides are downtime between turns, and the rather dragged-on ending as every player is close to winning. Still an enjoyable experience if one has a few hours to spare.

Only one play in, but thought it was a fascinating game! Got to play as the Cave which was very cool. Looking forward to trying this one out more! Not easy to learn or teach which may keep it from getting played as often as I'd like. 

Edit: Got to try it out solo a couple of times to learn the roles better and found that very helpful. The rules can certainly be a bit fiddly, but the experience is very unique. If you have a group willing to invest a little time into the learning of their respective role, then this title is worth checking out.

This game creates really fun player interactions and the different roles are interestingly integrated with each other.  While the rules aren't too complicated by themselves, understanding the interactions and trying to set up future turns is not easy.

At first it was an overwhelming load of rules, but as I got comfortable with each of the characters I found Vast to be an impressive experiment in asymmetry. Some parts of it are inelegant, especially at varied player counts. But despite the asymmetry, it keeps everything balanced until the end.

RATING: 5
Amazing idea! Quite poorly executed :(

Way too complicated. Just as an example the rules videos for each character is 12-18 minutes long each, and this needs to be explained to each player in order to play.

The game relies completely on leader bashing for balance, which is not something I enjoy.

Only played the Goblin race which was completely powerless in the end game. Very easy to get a round where you can't do anything as well since spawning takes an entire game round (which is like 10 minutes).

Again amazing idea, if only the game could be streamlined.

My only play of this was a flop - no one really knew how to play their characters, five people (With the cave being very distracted) left the game feeling very imbalanced and overwhelmingly difficult to teach.  With a proper introduction, with less newbies and a lower player count perhaps, my rating could drastically improve here.

Pretty steep learning curve on this since each character/role is basically playing a different game against the others.  I'd highly recommend watching a video before trying to just dive into it.  We got through a game in about an hour and change and it seemed balanced enough so I don' think we did anything glaringly wrong.  I'll have to get a few more plays under my belt to have a firm opinion, but out of the gates I had a decent enough experience.

RATING: 7
If nothing else, Vast is a unique and innovating approach to an asymmetrical game. Beyond it's unique approach, though, Vast provides a fun playing experience with a good amount of "replay factor," mainly because each role is COMPLETELY different as far as win condition and mechanics. This strength also proves to be Vast's greatest drawback: it's difficult to just pick up and play for new players because the sheer number of rules to learn is high. Sure, you could argue that you just need to learn your personal role, but you really need to have an idea of how each other role works as well so that you can avoid danger and also do something when someone else is about to win!
Overall, Vast: The Crystal Caverns is a great game if you're willing to invest almost your entire first play into learning the cadence of the game. Definitely a winner.

Rules-related issues, coupled with limited interaction between players lead to considerable downtime.

Love this game! Wow, I have looked forward to this game for a while now. Got a copy at Gen Con and I was not disappointed. The game play variability will keep this game fresh for years to come. Components are good, art is quirky and looks nice. The rules will take a little while to get a hold of. There will most likely be lots of referencing while you running through each different character for the first time. One you have played the character, the next run through will be much smoother and more enjoyable. I was not disappointed in the least and encourage everyone to give this game a try.

I don't get what all the fuss is about... Mediocre at best with some bad game design (such as the goblin player only being able to take cards at the start of their turn meaning they have to spend a lot of time reading and deciding whilst the rest of the table is waiting). We didn't find it fun at all.

Provisional rating after 1 play as the Cave.

We were 5 players, Knight, Goblins, Thief, Dragon and Cave. I was told that as the cave I was supposed to slow the other players down until I could trigger the collapse and turn over 5 crystal tiles.

I couldn't see how I could slow the other players down. 

The omen tile draw allowed me twice during the game to affect another player with the "Sleep" power. I removed 1 treasure from the thief (but doesn't really adversely affect them because that treasure still counts towards their win) and I removed 1 cube from the dragon as they were about to awake, but otherwise didn't affect her.

Otherwise I was left spinning tiles on the edge to place more tiles down quicker, and trying to place tiles down quickly to get to the collapse state.

The forced dropping of the treasure tiles/crystal tiles created a cluster around the entrance that allowed the thief to power up quickly (the ultimate winner of the game).

Not at all balanced in my limited experience. Played a three player game as the Cave and it was literally impossible for me to win.

This is such a vastly different gaming experience to the norm that I have no idea where this will eventually sit for me ratings-wise. Firstly, I love balanced asymmetry in a game and I applaud the effort. If nothing else I want to explore the game purely to see how well it's been done. It's a weird rules explanation - everyone just reads their own rules, and then we start, gradually working out how each person wins and who's going to be hitting who, and who do we need to work on slowing down. My fear is that the player who gets away with stuff and falls through the cracks the most will sneak the win. It obviously benefits from everyone knowing all the powers inside out and playing equally well and equally vigilantly. Which will require a few games with a dedicated and willing crew, which isn't always easy to organise. My second fear is that games would then drag out past their staying power, as at their heart, each power is relatively simple in what it can do and what it needs to do. The beating heart of this game is not the provision of any rich decision making process, as that's not there, but instead it's the exploring of its asymmetrical conceit. And that ain't for everybody, but I’d be willing.

An interesting premise where you explore a dungeon as five different characters each of which has its own goal. This includes a dragon, thief, knight, goblin or even the cave itself. The objectives are intertwined making it so you don't necessarily want to prevent others from advancing as their advancement may help you, as long as they don't win. The mechanics vary from character to character as well thus there is a lot of variability. So far I have played the knight an the cave both of which have their own interesting mechanics.

Vast: The Crystal Caverns is a VERY asymetric game--each player is given a completely different rules set with different mechanics and a different winning condition.  The Goblins have to manage deploying and managing the populations of three different tribes, and win by killing the knight.  The knight performs a variety of sidequests to get more action cubes, and wins by killing the dragon.  The dragon builds himself up by eating goblins and making crystals, and wins by waking up and escaping the dungeon.  The cave has a variety of tricks to try to keep everyone else from winning, and wins if he can last long enough to collapse.  While it's impossible to comment about balance without playing a whole lot more than I did, I found I didn't really enjoy the types of interactions in the game.  Players really seemed entrusted with trying to keep each other from winning or doing anything positive, and indeed many of the win conditions of the game involved knocking another player down.  That just isn't my sort of thing.

Wow!  Brain burn comes if you try to learn how every part plays of this asymmetrical game.  Did I say asymmetrical?  I meant the MOST asymmetrical game I've ever played.  Each role interacts uniquely with the other but plays with a different set of mechanics.  Goblins run from dragon and attack knight...Knight attacks dragon and avoids goblins... Dragon hides from knight and eats goblins...and Cave builds and furnishes caverns and then tries to kill everyone.  Oh yeah, and there is a Thief...   Whew...   Art is kind of ugly and 60s/70s cartoony but game play is what brings you here and makes you return.

Played this game once, and it's just crazy how all of these different roles work together.  This game definitely is going to require MULTIPLE plays to work out how to balance the game properly.  In my first and only playthrough we played on the easiest difficulty to finish the game faster and in that playthrough the dragon seemed the strongest by far with the cave looking like it didn't have a chance to come close with winning.

BUT I can see issues with how EVERYONE played.  The knight didn't use bombs to hit the dragon to make him run away.  The goblins did not hit the night to make him feel a bit more urgent about hitting the dragon before he died.  The thief was not stealing treasure before the dragon could get to it.  And the cave was not expanding the cave in aggressive manners to make the game longer and to hide away treasure, also they were not efficient at making tiles appear more efficiently.

So I can see how this came can balance itself out with more plays, it just seems for the time being the easiest roles are by far the strongest (Knight and Dragon).

Played once with 5 players and that's certainly not the ideal number to play your first game with as everyone is struggling with his rules and downtime is just huge. Especially the Goblins is a lot of management for 3 different tribes and that player claims most of the time. 

The game itself is not really my preferred genre. But with 3 and quick gameplay, I could be convinced to play this again.

I get it, I get why this was all of the rage at GenCon 2016. Definitely a cool concept with all different objectives and motives in a single game play. Very cool. I wonder about how it might play out differently being a different role. It is cool. besides from playing all characters, each individual role seems pretty linear in that you have a mission and you must not derive from the mission or you will likely fail. Happy to have played it and will try it again.

May 2017: Huge issue for me is ratio of rules to depth. Having totally different rules for each player definitely doesn't help. So players are bound to make rule interpretation errors that will be recognized well into the game.

The kingmaking here is hilarious -- and encouraged. Players affect each other very differently; often you can't retaliate with the same impact During my game (as the knight) I was very much in behind. So I intentionally let my health drop so that others would have to sacrifice their turns to prevent someone else from winning. Highly amusing, but made me feel like a douchebag.

Goblins trying to murder the knight; a dragon looking to wreak havoc on the surface; a knight looking for glory by slaying the scaled winged beast; a thief searching for treasure; and a cave looking to devour its trespassers. 
The best "true" asymmetric game I've played to date. There's a lot of rules to take in at first, but once you get going it's a great game. Very high replayability; mainly because it feels like a different game when you play a different character.

This is what I expect from a kickstarter -- a clever and ambitious idea that is not quite finished.  But it's closer than most such games.  It seems well balanced and with a well managed level of luck, and it is highly asymmetric.

- I worry that the game takes too long for what it is (but it will likely be much faster on replays).  Still, even if the box label of 60-90 is accurate, I think that's a bit too long for the current game's depth.  It began brilliant but everyone was tired of it by the time it ended.
- The rulebook is annoyingly vague and/or silent on some key issues and more corner cases.  It is overall poorly organized, but mostly complete.
- It is all too likely that the game will devolve into pure politics, kingmaking, or kill-doctor-lucky style negotiations.  The rest of the game can get obscured by those dynamics, lessening the whole.
- It is all too possible for some players to know they cannot win well before the game ends, which worsens the kingmaking element

But I'd play it again in the hopes that I will be proven wrong.

Very interesting game that's completely asymmetrical.  However, there are so much different rules to read through and a lot of the rules are not clearly written.  Might get better with more plays but there's just too many little rules that it takes a bit of the enjoyment away.  Characters are well balanced but some characters are more interesting to play such as the Cave and Goblin horde while others are pretty plain to play like the Thief.

i really love the asymmetrical roles (especially the cave!!) and the tile laying exploration! plus, the thought put into scaling down to smaller player counts including solo is noticeable. having said that, the game just doesn't get much play for us. teaching it is such a bear. seems like we never get goblins right and the cave player can feel a little superfluous until they have decided who needs to be slowed. if i wasn't looking forward to the new expansion roles (and honestly a little nostalgic for one of my early kickstarter purchases) i'd probably consider letting this one slip away in my current collection downsize kick.

Fun game and one of a kind. Tile flipping, dungeon crawling, asymmetric board game where you can even play as the cave! The downside is that means it is basically 5 games in one...trying to teach this to new people can be a challenge and your first game will take a long time. The ones following that will go quicker but still be a challenge if anyone decides they want to play a new role. Would like to play this more than I currently do, but sometimes the reality is that people don't want to invest a ton of time into learning a new game!

This is a game that requires "the right group" to play it.  The right group would need to know how to min/max other players (being selfish vs. balancing the board is a big point).  This means each player needs to understand every role.  To do so, they would also need to play a few times to get the hang of the game, as the first time will be a wash.

I suspect it would work for a group that is willing to invest multiple (but potentially unsatisfying) plays on it.  However, our group doesn't fit the profile.

I absolutely love this game.  I sat down as soon as i got it and played a 5-player game solo just so i could better understand the rules.  This way, I can teach it better to the new players in my group.    The thief stole the victory. (Pun intended for eye-rolling purposes)

This game has a brilliant design ultimately balancing asymmetrical powers. 

But for first timers you are teaching 5 games to the players. Play time is estimated at 90 mins. Would agree except for the majority of time used with combination of new & existing players. Each role have about 4 mechanisms or steps but they are each independent and different. Easily 45 minutes rules explanation. 

Would highly recommend if you are going to teach this game run through solo with each character first and get the basics (but not nuances) of mechanics.

This is definitely a unique game that is out of step with every other design I've played, so if you want a new experience, look no further.

However, though I love the idea, the gameplay is boring. And even conceptually, in some ways it is TOO Asymmetric. It definitely focuses on the asymmetry to the point of madness; what you get out of this game is basically a super simple, light, game (no matter which side you play), but it feels like you're playing some super complex heavy fiddly game with a bunch of rules due to all of the moving pieces introduced by the different sides. 

 So a super light game with a heavy mental investment. That's not the kind of payoff you or I want out of a board game.

Also, the gameplay feels a bit "grindy", like you're just doing kinda repetitive tasks over and over.

Tentative rating: 7. Could easily rise or fall. Only 2 plays in so far. The rules have not yet fallen into the background. The first two plays have not been as fun as I was hoping or expecting, but I am not sure if it's because this is so different than other games that it takes longer to wrap my head around. I think I understand most roles now, but I'm still not sure if I find the game fun or strategically/tactically interesting. I will wait until I play each role at least once before I pass further judgement. I admire this game, but I'm not sure I like it yet.

We've only played this game once so far, but we found it to be a very interesting abstract game. We made some rules mistakes...the rules aren't too complex, but there are a few things that are easy to miss in initial plays. That being said, we all really enjoyed the play through and plan to play it again when we can get everyone together again. Don't be intimidated by the separate rules for each role...it's not as complicated as it sounds and the way the roles fit together and how you manage the gameplay is pretty cool.

RATING: 10
As the creator and co-designer of Vast, I'm obviously VERY biased. I get that. But, that said, there's something you have to understand about this game. This rating isn't a self-congratulatory pat on the back. 

It's a testament to a community of people who rallied together in a now-apocryphal BGG thread to create a new kind of game. 

It's a testament to the hundreds and hundreds of games played by Patrick Leder, my co-designer and publisher, who relentlessly and brilliantly broke my original design down to its carbon molecules and rebuilt it into the gleaming modern game you see today. 

And it's a testament to the cunning, playful, eternally curious explorations and permutations created by my co-co-designer and developer, Kyle Woelfel, who discovered how to pull seemingly limitless variations of gameplay out of this idea.

The description for a 10 star rating is, "Outstanding - will always enjoy playing." This community, and my co-designers, have created an outstanding game. And because of them, I will always, always enjoy playing it.

(But yeah, I'm still really biased.)

RATING: 7
I really like the concept of this game.  In this game each player plays a different role with their own personal win condition.  The Goblins are trying to kill the Knight.  The Knight is trying to slay the Dragon.  The Dragon is trying to escape the Cave.  The Cave is trying to collapse before any other player can achieve their win condition.  There is also a Thief role which I haven't seen played yet.  I like this mechanic of players attempting their own goals while all playing in the same game space.

Each of the roles seemed reasonably balanced.  In our first game the Dragon won but this was a "learning game" as we tend to call our first plays and each other player was within a turn or two of being the winner.  While each of the characters may be balanced in terms of gameplay and ability to win.  They certainly don't seem balanced in terms of enjoyment.  Particularly I found the Knight very boring in comparison to the other 3 roles played.  The Knight is a character that ramps up and early in the game can do very, very little.  And many things the other players can do can reverse the Knight's progress once he does start ramping up.  On his turn he basically walks around the map and hits things.  He doesn't really have any special powers or variable actions.  He has a certain number of cubes to place on things like move distance, strength, and number of actions and he places them and does those things.

Watching the other players I was jealous at how variable their turns were and interesting decisions they had.  The Goblin players had 3 different tribes that all did different things.  3 decks of cards to draw from and the ability to hide and ambush other players, conscript monsters with special abilities, and play "Secrets" cards that did neat things.  The dragon drew a hand of symbol cards that he could combine for any of 12+ different powers and had decisions to make on many different ways to power up from eating Goblins to hoarding treasure to even just not moving in a round.  And the Cave got to build the map and know where everything was and mess with the different players to keep them all from winning.  He also drew tokens that could be used to do 6 neat different special powers and gets to choose whenever tiles are added to the map or the Knight activates an event or finds a treasure.  By comparison the Knight was boring with much fewer decisions to make.

So, nifty game where I wouldn't want to play one of the roles ever again.  The components were alright.  The purple tint to all the tiles made it seem lazy when it could have been beautiful.  The rulebook also needs a major rewrite.  Even with a huge FAQ that exists because of the inadequacy of the rulebook there were still tons of nebulous and unanswered questions even in our very first play.

RATING: 6
For me, more interesting than fun. To get the best out of this everyone has to have a good understanding of their role and how to play it against the other players. In a gaming group where you go a long time between repeated plays, this is difficult to achieve. Seems like a lot of the victory just goes to the guy that benefited the most from someone else's poor play.

Each player has their own set of rules, making it more time consuming to teach. The rule sheets for each player are well done, but it's still a bit much for some players.

Strategically, there really aren't a lot of interesting decisions. I had fun with it, and enjoyed seeing something different. But it wasn't compelling enough to keep around.

I still have a lot to see but Vast shows great promise. There's a lot of rules to get through so early play-throughs are full of Googling and rulebook flipping but I don't mind it that much because the game is very engaging. Everyone wins by different conditions so you find yourself making temporary alliances, coercing your targets into slowing down other players only to turn around and attack them in the end.

Kickstarter. Including character add-on bundle with miniatures. Assymetric roles and every player has their own objectives and rules. I like the theme (dungeon crawling knight hunting a dragon and watching out for the orcs). But it's time consuming to learn and everyone needs a few plays before they get the hang of it. That makes it hard to bring down from the shelf. So it only gets a six.

RATING: N/A
Wondering if the gameplay itself is good enough to justify the minimum of 5 plays you need to fully explore this game. Though it is cool to be asymmetric, the drawback is that you have no clue what the others are doing unless you are specifically paying attention to it due to your role (as with the Cave player).

Seems pretty straightforward and fun though, should try this one out.

'Vast' is the descriptor for the rulebook. This is one of those games that I'm going to retain as a favorite child, even as I slowly, tortuously accept that he's just a punk kid.

I really enjoy learning all of the unique mechanics of each role. Every time I play this game I get a greater appreciation for how they all fit together. Even when I'm losing I'm still having fun building my respective character engine. As per the nature of any asymmetrical  game, it is tough to teach the new players but with so many handicap variants (5 per character) you're always going to be able to adjust for beginners. It's a very clever game and I can see my family, friends and I getting a lot of value and replayability out of this one.

Playing as the Cave in this is so satisfying, as everyone else scrambles around the board you have designed for them, fighting each other off for your well placed treasures. Only to then watch them scream and run for the exit as you collapse in on them like a suicidal maniac. Each role however, is 'vastly' different (see what I did there?) and I hear there is an expansion coming with more roles? I can't wait. This game is bomb. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
As much as I feel like there's a great game here, after a few plays I simply cannot find it. 

The theme is a classic one, and the asymmetrical player powers are a amazing idea on the surface. Unfortunately, nothing really brings the game together. Each player is essentially playing their own game, and there's not enough to keep you engaged during every other player's turn. Add to this the somewhat inconsistent wording and the lack of a reference that ties everything together really hurts it. 

I am certain that there's a wonderful game in this box, but it's likely going to take several plays to really appreciate the full experience. It's a shame that it's not compelling enough to keep me coming back to find it.

Vast was definitely excellent, though the long teaching time (and mild-relearning each time you play a new role) mean that it's unlikely to hit the table often for me. Still, a design triumph and keeps people really engaged throughout play, with frequent very tense endings.

Despite the great number of variants included in the box, it seems still like the best way to play the game is with exactly four players playing Knight, Dragon, Cave, Goblins.

Also note the box time of 60-90 minutes is wildly inaccurate. you could probably play this game in 90mins if people know it well, but 60 definitely a stretch. Expect it to be about 2 hours.

Fantastic asymmetric game, which works very well WHEN all the players are familiar with the nuances and rules differences between the roles.

VAST promises a one of a kind experience. Five players playing five completely different games, all on one common board. Each is racing to achieve the goal of their game, with their actions either directly or indirectly slowing down their opponents. In a nutshell, the Knight must kill the Dragon, the Goblins must kill the Knight, the Dragon must escape the Cave before any of this happens and in the biggest twist of all, the Cave (yes that's right, the game's setting is also a player!) must collapse and trap all of them together to win. There is also a somewhat unrelated player role for a fifth player, the Thief who must collect a bunch of crystals for a local Warlock. While he would love to just leave the others alone and mind his own business, every other player at the table can kill him with a single hit. Which they will be happy to deliver, to knock him off his quest. In one of the game's funniest concessions, the Thief is under a Groundhog Day curse and relives the same day over and over. When he dies, he simply respawns at the mouth of the cave and starts his whole quest over.

Does this sound amazing? It kind of is, particularly from a game design standpoint. This was quite a feat to pull off and the game seems remarkably balanced, once everyone knows what they are doing. Which might be the game's biggest weakness. It will take a couple of games before everyone learns how to use their actions to stop the other players from winning. Your first few games are likely to end in quick, anti-climatic run-away victories. Once you figure that out, the next time you play a different role you have to relearn the process. My guess is that it will take anywhere from 4-10 games to get everyone in an average game group to a mastery level where the game can shine.

Which brings me to my second criticism. Not all the roles are interesting enough to play the 10 times that are likely needed. The Knight plays the most straight-forward game, as her adventure is largely an exploratory dungeon crawl. It's a simplistic role, although vanilla dungeon crawls are popular enough to be a whole genre, so it's interesting enough for most, I think. The Dragon role is quite fun, and has by far the most interesting set of powers, although his actual goal is a little bit bland as it is simply to remove all the cubes from his sleep bars and run away.

The other two primary roles have less upside. The Goblin player is basically playing an accounting game. Each turn they decide to which Goblin tribe to add disks, then they count the disks and see if they provide enough movement and strength to inflict a point of damage, after which the stack of disks largely dissolves, to be rebuilt again. So it's basically just a lot of counting and guessing where the Knight will go. It's not really the stuff of Goblin kings, so to speak. The Cave is even worse. Turns for the Cave involve simply picking and laying down tiles for the Knight to explore. Some are traps, some are Goblin ambush spots and others are treasures for the Thief and Knight. It is largely a "referee" role, as the Cave's primary function is to make the other players task easier or harder depending on how they are doing in the game. it keeps you involved on their turns which is nice, but the trade-off is your own turn is incredibly uninteresting.

The Thief is the best gimmick, but it's largely just that and it does not hide the fact that it was a late addition tacked on for the Kickstarter. Again, it is a tribute to the author's design chops that he could insert it and make it work, but I am not entirely sure it is fun to play a game where the goal is to have everyone else at the table ignore you.

The last thing I want to touch on about the game's demands is its requirement for players of exactly equal skill and experience. Since the players themselves directly provide all of the resistance to someone winning, an imbalance in experience causes artificially short games. Often times in early plays, it can be tough to even see how it could be stopped. Again, this can be learned but I'm not sure people will get past those early frustrations, partly because it is demoralizing and mostly because a lot of these roles just aren't fun enough to justify those dozen painful learning plays.

Like 504, this a cool experiment and a great conversation piece but I think its value lies more in being a collector novelty than a collection cornerstone.

RATING: 9.5
A favourite of mine. Vast is a tile laying dungeon crawl between 1-5 people. Each player will control a unique character that plays differently from the other four. With their own unique decks, components, and victory condition, players chase and avoid one another while accomplishing small tasks that bring each of them closer to their own end goal. As a general overview, the knight is trying to kill the dragon, the dragon is trying to escape, and the goblins are trying to kill the knight. Meanwhile, the goal of the cave is to collapse in on itself to kill all players inside, and the thief is trying to stay out of everyone's way to collect treasure. This small ecosystem of characters with different purposes, goals, and rules makes Vast completely asymmetrical, setting it apart from other games entirely. It's especially impressive that the game is so well balanced. I've found that players will all get extremely close to their end goals by the end of the game, creating tons of tension as players race to be the winner. One two player game I had in particular came down to a dice roll, leaving a 50/50 chance of either player winning. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a new and fresh board game experience.

Rating of 6 after first play which was a real mess. Great potential, rulebook is insanely horrible. Sold it forward, the first try playing it really killed the game for me. Unfinished and complicated rulebook (kickstarter 1st ed., I do hope the new one will be a lot better).

Very interesting game due to it's complete asymmetry. When going into this game one really needs to appreciate that, from a strategic viewpoint and from that of feeling the need to know what you are doing in relation to other players, this game is going to fall a little flat on your first play. Once you have played multiple times it really is a great playing experience I feel.

Not a bad game at all. It is super complex which makes it hard to grasp. The different roles and actions requires a person to learn all of the characters. Having players read the rules beforehand is a plus. It is difficult to teach owing to the asymmetric roles of each character in the game.

This is a whole new take on dungeon-crawling.  There are plenty of elements here that you'll find in other games, but never before in a combination like this.

Unlike other games with unique player powers where every character is different yet still playing toward more or less the same goals, this is a truly asymmetrical game where every player is [i]completely[/i] different, with completely different goals, completely different things to do on their turn, and completely different ways to do them, yet they all still intertwine brilliantly into one cohesive game.

All five roles are extremely well-balanced despite being so different, and games always end with players in close contention.  Each offers its own particular charms and comes with a completely different set of strategies and play styles, so there's a little something here for almost any gamer. [i](Except deck building.  There's no deck building in this game.  Yet...)[/i]

Also included in the game are a TON of extra official variants.   You can play with any number of players and in any combination of roles, and there are even fully-developed solo rules for four of the five roles [i](sorry Cave, no solo for you, but don't let that stop you from trying)[/i].   The terrain variant adds extra tile features to the game that expand the map and open up new strategies.   A set of difficulty cards allows you to easily adjust the game to suit even a wide range of player skill levels by making the individual goals easier or harder to accomplish.


[i]Full Disclosure:
I've been playtesting this game ever since the early PNP version appeared in a WIP thread, and have had a ton of fun with it throughout the many iterations since. Eventually I even joined the design team.  This was a very good game way back when it started, but the improvements made since then have taken it up countless notches, and the final post-Kickstarter version will be by far the best yet, and something of which to be very proud.[/i]

I can't say there is a game like this. The best way to describe it is Betrayal of the House on the Hill meets Forbidden Island (or Desert) meets a VERY elaborate game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each player is basically playing with different mechanics. Each player is basically a different mechanic of game play. You're either the Knight, The Dragon, The Goblins, The Cave or The Thief (only recommended in 5 player game), and each has a completely different way of winning. And each plays differently. If you like combat, choose the Knight who basically has to level up so he can defeat the Dragon while avoiding the Goblins who's game win is to kill the Knight. Meanwhile the Dragon just wants to escape the cave once he/she's awake, and the cave doesn't want anyone to leave, and needs to collapse the cave to win. The Cave role is basically tile laying and and bag draw and setting the game board for the others. YOU get to be the board of the Forbidden Place. We didn't play with the Thief, but basically they want to steal all the treasure and crystals. Very cool game. A well balanced game too that despite appearances during game play does not favor one role over the other. Anyone can literally win this game, they just have to outwit the others. I'm curious how it'll be received once in the market and if it will be popular.

One of those complicated games where each player does different things, so essentially you sit and wait for others to do their thing and trust they're doing it right. It was fun, and I'm pretty sure after a few plays it would probably be more fun without all the rehashing of the rules (and knowing what other players can do).

I've played all with all 5 roles, Knight v Dragon v Cave, Knight v Dragon, Knight v Cave and each solo game. Each one felt pretty different, with Knight v Cave being my favourite, because it felt a lot like Netrunner.

I really want to play this more and more though. I think once my group becomes familiar enough with each role, this game'll shine.

Cave's probably my favourite role, followed by the Thief (though his turns are so short and it's generally such a long wait!)

Nice asymmetric game play.  Totally different depending on the character you are playing.  It's a little hard to start out since you can't really help any one with their turn.  Everyone has to try to understand the full rules of their player -- and the strategies of playing some of them aren't obvious.  The dragon and the Cave seem pretty difficult.

What a cool concept. Every role basically plays by its own rules. I adore the graphics, they are gorgeous! The entire game has a cool style of its own. The player aids are actually all the rules for each role, directly copied from the rules. That is fantastic!

There is also enough of a rules reminder on each player board that once you master a role, that should be about all you need, but they didn't stop there. They also included a play aid with easily forgotten rules, helpful hints, and some illustrated examples.

The gamplay is delicious, and can at times become slightly political as you have to keep slowing down the leader. I love it!

I loved this game from the theme to the characters with different powers and varying win conditions. A tactical dungeon crawler with RPG elements? Yes, sign me up. Unfortunately, as much as I liked playing, half my opponents hated this game. As in if they never played Vast again it would be too soon. I can't recommend this game because so many players find it awful.

A very interesting game where each player's role is not only asymmetric based on its powers... but by the rules it follows!  A large part of the game has to do with keeping the other players in check until you're ready to make a strike of your own to win.  Its completely fascinating to see how the roles interact to hinder each other and I'm looking forward to a lot more enjoyable plays of feeling out how best to play all the roles.

I would play this game a few more times, especially if I had a good group of fun people. I don't know that I would buy it, simply because I don't get a lot of chances where I can really pull together five folks, and I think it would be less fun without the full complement of players.

Extremely innovative. This game is so different from everything else that everyone is curious to try it out. Asymmetrical roles and random board means that the there is a combination of luck and skill to gameplay. 
Negative: The tiles themselves lack a bit of polish. Everything else is colorful, attractive and relatively clear. The thief seems to be the easiest to play and win with, which is fine. Will have to see what the new roles add to the game.

I love that the game comes with wooden component versions of cardboard components, and individual rule pages for each player, and an extra page of errata and easy-to-forget rules.

I need an "easy-to-not-read-thoroughly" errata page, though. In our first game, I played the Knight, and I took my bomb tokens, and I read the Bomb ability as "Use bombs to attack the dragon and oh I can ignore this, there's no Dragon in this game." And then I didn't use the bombs to destroy walls, which is the only use of the tokens, and the alternate use of that ability.

The Cave, at least as of our first game, seems underpowered. Or disadvantaged. The goblins killed me mere turns before the Cave would have run out of tiles, and although he did manage to get some crystal tiles on the outskirts, he wouldn't have won within three or four turns, and there was no way the goblins weren't going to kill me when they did, or soon after. I have to wonder if playing the Cave is less enjoyable, given that it appears you're far less likely to win. We had 4 crystal tiles within 3 spaces of the start tile, thanks to the luck of the draw and the requirement to place crystal tiles on your turn before other tiles.

The strategy for the Knight wasn't clear to me, initially. I understood that the goblins can only appear on one of their matching tiles, and so I sometimes intentionally explored nearby tiles of goblin tribes that were still hidden, so they'd only be able to appear at a distance. But I didn't realize that they could move any number of tiles, nor that they lose population if they move out of too many lit tiles. I was handily defeated, and I'm not sure what I could have done differently. The goblins were almost always at max population, plus strength tokens, and I only acquired 5 action points throughout the game, so I couldn't waste cubes on maximizing my strength to 4 for the off-chance that I would be attacked by the only goblin tribe that was weaker than that. One of the monsters caused me to lose 5 grit when they attacked me, and that is detrimental to my success.

The goblin player did unknowingly cheat for the first few rounds, but we don't know what the impact was. We didn't realize that he couldn't use his tribes' special abilities while hidden, and he did so. Frequently. By the time his Fangs tribe entered the board, he was at max rage, drawing three war cards for the most options possible; by the time the Eye tribe appeared, he had a full hand of secret cards to play against me.

Going back to "easily-not-read-if-you're-impatient" rules: the Knight can't move unless he still has encounters remaining. I frequently moved and then decided if I needed additional encounters, until halfway through the game when I realized my error. However, I also thought that every time I wanted to do a thing, it required a new encounter: flip a tile? One encounter. Grab that treasure? One encounter. It wasn't until we were nearly done that I learned that a single encounter covered everything done in one space: enter a dark space with a goblin tribe and a treasure, then flip it and see it also has a crystal, so you fight the goblins, grab the treasure and smash the crystal? One encounter.

I'm sure when we use the Dragon and the Thief within the next couple games, we'll make even more mistakes, but so far despite the challenges, I am loving this game. I look forward to making use of the difficulty variant cards if we ever need more of a challenge. Excellent first birthday present this year.

UPDATE: we didn't seed the cave tiles at all. Future games will be far less one-sided when 8 crystals or 5 vaults don't show up within 3 spaces of the entrance.

THIS GAME CAME WITH MINIS which is pretty much why I bought it. Was a super hot game at GenCon recently, but I actually bought it much earlier via Kickstarter. I think it was a reprint of an earlier game and all the minis were added on in this reprint. 

I have neither played this game nor painted any of the minis - yet.

The real star of this game for me is the Cave. Placing the tiles in such a way to obstruct and help all other players is gaming goodness. Mind you while the cave is easy to explain it's not easy to play. I feel like the other roles are more the actors on the stage. I think a good game of this requires a skilled cave player. 

Explaining this game is though. Roles are not that difficult but each player has different rules and gameplay

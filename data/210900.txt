This is a small abstract game featuring a bizarre subject: topiary. Players represent tourists looking at a field of topiary art; the idea is to have smaller plants be in front of larger ones so that the tourists, who may not walk in the area, can see everything from a small distance. Then there are also various shapes of topiary, and placing these in a line grants a bonus. By picking up cards and placing them strategically, you try to improve your own line of sight while blocking that of others.

In practice I found the game to be difficult to plan and play because of all the chaos which arises from having a limited set of tiles to place as well as take into account all of the conflicting demands placed on where the topiary must appear. Since tourists may not stand in the same spot, you end up with rather bizarre encirclement with, obviously, completely opposite view requirements. It makes the experience rather grating; something that takes some doing for a game lasting only 10 to 15 minutes or so. 

All in all, not a fan. Really not a fan.

This is a filler which, I think, is very difficult to control what's going on and the actions of the other players. I still have to decide if this is worth another look, or that the sheer amount of luck, and the ability of other players to foil your best laid plans breaks the game for me. At least it is an easy game to explain and it is short.

"Overall, Topiary is very good! I'm a big fan of the theme, which naturally pushes me to like the game a bit more. The art is endearing, the gameplay is thinky and blocky without being too aggressive for me, and it's a light, simple game that's easy to teach and fairly straightforward to play. The scoring is a tiny bit irksome because there's a lot of numbers to keep track of, but that's how it goes, sometimes. If you're looking for a nice, light abstract game to add to your collection or if the idea of cutting hedges into the shape of a T-Rex excites you as much as it excites me, I'd highly recommend giving Topiary a whirl! It's a lot of fun."

Non pecca per originalità ma è un simpatico gioco astratto adatto a tutta la famiglia e spiegabile in pochi minuti. Forte interazione e cattiverie sono alla base del gioco che rischia di soffrire di paralisi d'analisi se giocato con pensatori fini. Un gioco che a mio avviso va giocato in leggerezza e velocità risultando un buon filler o adatto come introduttivo.

Super! Really cute and fast tile placement game that can be cutthroat at the same time.  Really loved it and can't wait to own it and play as my filler game before or after game day. Right up my alley and one of the best from the month.

RATING: 8
Clever game of choosing your scoring lines in the end game as the board is being built. Feels a little like the scoring lines in slot machines in a way, actually. Opportunities to block players after they commit to  a row, but it'll only block one of their players, and the only way to block them is to actually give them a large tile that's worth 4 or 5 points at least (but you could be blocking them off from 12+ points by doing so).

Two things that could be issues for people: 1) It can be very difficult to keep track of how everyone else will score from the midgame on, and in our game we had a player that kept giving amazing points to another player because he wasn't paying attention to how his moves would affect others, effectively kingmaking that person without realizing it and without other players being able to do anything about it, and 2) the tiles in hand scoring was forgotten about by pretty much everyone, and even after that, keeping track of if it needs to be smaller or larger without a guide or visual cue anywhere was difficult.

These aren't major issues, just problems that cropped up in our playthrough. Personally I enjoy keeping track of other sight lines with my moves, so I enjoyed that aspect of the game, but I can't insure that other players will be as vigilant.

:thumbsup: Beautiful production from an small publisher. The adorable illustrations (done by the game’s designer) belie the vicious gameplay. And the looks of the game on the table are sure to attract new players.
:thumbsup: Interesting use of line of sight.

----

:thumbsdown: While explaining the game, you will have to repeat the scoring rules (a few times). They baffle most first-time players.
:thumbsdown: It seems that players either love it or hate it. Everyone I’ve played this with agrees that it’s surprisingly well designed, but that doesn’t mean they like this game.

If you get the chance to play the new Renegade Game Topiary definitely check it out. I first heard about it through the Gameboy Geeks' nice review and rules school on Miniature Market. Super simple mechanics to learn yet with ample strategy, great gateway with tons of replay ability. The art is captivating and it's a theme that hasn't really been done. It's not much like Photosynthesis other than the botany connection and a modest parallel with the shade concept. In Topiary you're trying to view the most and largest ornamental shrubs in incremental order in a topiary garden by placing your meeples and then replacing an existing unrevealed tile along specific sight lines. Be careful, your opponent can select a nearby row and block your view with a taller shrub. Bonuses are awarded for viewing multiples of the same kind of shrub in one sight line and if you're able to hold within your hand tiles of a particular topiary that you've seen during the game with a higher value. My only criticism is the box could've been 25% smaller and still accommodate all the pieces. Or they could've increased the component size, particularly the scoring track to better fit the box. That's a minor quibble though, otherwise you'll likely fall in love with this quick, fun game.

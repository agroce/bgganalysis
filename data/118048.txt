After playing it about 10 to 15 times it started to get a bit too repetitve for me but I still like to play it now and then and it's a great concept.

I would love to see an expansion for Targi.

Pretty slick new worker placement game with a positional dynamic.  Planning is a little limited, but there are plenty of interesting decisions to make.  Don't know why they didn't go for the normal, smaller KOSMOS 2-player box.  :(

RATING: 8
+ The added spacial considerations for where your tribe markers will end up makes choosing your actions just that much more interesting; Tribe cards giving you abilities makes for some cool and powerful combinations.
- A couple of the cards (like the one that takes away an opponent's piece for a turn) seem out of place in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.75
The best two-player-only worker placement game. The triangulation between the workers is a fantastic design.
The game is basically a card game with some tokens (resources). 
Moreover, the game combines card placement with set collection to score points, which adds a neat puzzle element.
The game offers a lot of randomization which makes each game different and interesting.
The box is quite compact (KOSMOS two-player series). One could put it into a smaller box for travelling.

1st play: Played a very un-representative game of this - it took a long time because we were constantly interrupted, but from what I did play, this is a thematic 2 player game that's not too hard and has lots of replayability from the different tribes cards.

2nd play: Second game went much faster, but still not a favorite. The wife likes it, so maybe the bland art isn't as big a problem as it is to me. Building the sets and placing workers to get bonus actions is so-so interesting, but I have better 2 player games.

Very good! It is one of the better Kosmos 2-Player-Games range! There is much interaction, since every placement of an own pawn blocks three cards for the other player. So, do I want to get cards for me - or do I want to block cards for my opponent? Maybe both is possible?
In addition, very beautiful illustrations and game material for a (very) small price.

RATING: 7
Place workers to collect sets of goods to trade in for "tribe" cards featuring oases, camps, camels etc. So far so very ho hum.  Targi's neat twist on this is that workers are placed around the edges of an ever changing tableau of cards and whatever is where they are placed is collected, but also whatever is at the intersection of a row and a column in which you have workers.  You can't place opposite opposing workers or a neutral robber.  This constrains placement and sets up some nice tensions.  Perhaps plays a little long for what it is.

Get beyond the poor Z-Man box artwork and Targi is quite pleasing to the eye and fairly well produced.

Very intricate game and as good as advertised.  I'm not sure how well it will play over time, but if I don't cheat by reading strategy articles, I suspect it will be a while before I plumb the depth of this game.  We got a couple of rules wrong; I didn't read the rulebook closely.

I'm looking forward to getting a better feel but this may well be my favorite small two player game.  It's not Fields of Arle, but it also doesn't take a half hour to set up.  A remarkably deep game given how streamlined the rules are and the physical size of the components.

Surprisingly good game for 2 players.
The theme seems not to be very interesting but during the play it made more sense and overall the game is not too abstract.
The board is build with cards. So it is not a pure card game but also not a full board game, very interesting.
The choice to place the 3 figures is very tricky and interesting.

11/18/17:  This is a great game because it is so different than everything else out there.  The components are relatively simple, and gameplay elegant.  There are a lot of tough decisions.  It's not so much player's taking shots at each other as you are both running as fast as you can with throwing occasional elbows at the other.

The German cover is so much better than what we're going to be getting over here in the US.  If there wasn't so much language dependence in the game, I'd be tempted to get the German version for the cover alone.

This game is quite elegant and interesting mechanically. Unfortunately, the optimization problem it creates is too simplistic; often, the best choice is quite obvious. And the only thing that can't be calculated out with certainty is the set-collection aspect, which is much less important than the worker-placement mechanic.

I like a variety of two-player games, but Targi may surplant some of my favorites save that it is not as simple a game as say Lost Cities. But that's where it shines, providing both a long term strategic set of choices as well as some tactical moves that you usually only see in 3 to 6 player games. After a few more plays, I may have to revise my rating upwards.

A nice game that almost feels abstract, but really isn't. The theme is rather "meh", but the actual effects of the tiles are very interesting. I'll have to play it more times, but for now, it's an interesting little game.

UPDATE:

Great game. It plays fast, and it always has interesting choices. With the mark of the games I really love, this one presents you with few choices, but makes you agonize over the actual choice you make.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Ingenious, tight, very high player interaction (mind you, it would be odd to have a two player game with little player interaction, but I suppose it's possible). Slight caveat: there's a degree of luck in the draw of the tribe cards. You might, for instance, be desperate for another Oasis card and one may never appear before the game end.

Azért vettem meg, mert sok helyen hallottam, hogy ez az egyik legjobb 2 személyes. Sajnos elég drága és ritkaság az angol, de végül meglett:) Nyelvfüggő, de nem vészesen! Nos, tényleg elég egyedi, értem a sikerét! Az akcióválasztás zseniális. Mind a körben lévő, mind a középső kártyák tetszettek. PL. a Noble kártya tök jó ötlet. Más játékban ahol van hasonló kézben tartott max 1 kártya, általában úgy szabályozzák le, hogy mondjuk kör elején lerakhatod. Itt erre is van ez a külön lap. A Fata morgana is jó! Nálunk a Caravan volt a sláger, amikor kevés nyersanyag kártya volt kinn:) Jó a rabló is, mint körjelző. Ami meglepett a mai "randomizáljunk mindent" korszakban, hogy rögzített helyen van az 1-16 kártya, simán lehetne hogy a sarkokon kívül a többit randomizáljuk?! Összességében egy nagyon letisztult, eredeti kis játék, aki szereti a ketteseket, az feltétlenül próbálja ki!
Ja még annyit, hogy a téma nem jön át, erősen absztrakt játék, de ez legyen a legnagyobb hibája:)

I am moderately a fan of the Kosmos 2-player line: I own many of these games, I enjoyed their clever, fresh and witty mechanics, but it seems I never get to play them.
So, of course, I jumped at the latest game in the line being nominated for 2012 KSdJ, and bought it at the first occasion I could (as the italian version came out: the game has some text, and german is off-limits for me and my S.O.).

Well, the game is indeed very clever and enjoyable: players must accumulate victory points trading wares, and the main mechanic is a sort of worker placement, where players place workers in the outer action spaces (there's a 5x5 action spaces grid, made with cards. When one performs the inner cards' actions, the cards are replaced) and get to perform actions both for the spaces they place the workers on AND for the inner spaces determined by the crossing of lines drawn starting from the spaces they put the workers on.

Ok, I know this sounds convoluted, but it is pretty simple after the first turn of the game...

Tentative rating is a 6.5: the game is funny and has some interesting tactical and startegic aspects, without being a masterpiece. I need to play it more to understand how deep it is.

RATING: 9
A worker placement game where the board is made up of cards and changes as you play.  Interesting mechanic of claiming rows, columns, and any intersecting points.  As with most Euros the goal of the game is to have the most amount of victory points at game's end.  As with any card game, there is an element of luck, but there is also a good amount of strategy and tactics as well.  Easy to pick up, explain and play with new players.

This is a fun game that is heavier than its appearance. If you like games like Agricola creatures big and smal this could be your cup of tea. The worker-placement in this game is quite interesting and more thinky since there is a loot of planing to be made to achieve your goal of set collection. My only complaint is that the components are cheap. This game would benefit from a board and adding support for more players (2-4). This could be made whit 2 different boards. Essentially you create the board from provided cards and i find that cheap looking. In addition the game could be made more thematic. Some cards effect doesnt work whit what they represent and this makes the game feel rather gamy.

The back side of the cards could have a darker sand/dune picture whit no distraction so that when the cards are not revealed they would create a illusion of a unexplored desert.

This is a wonderful 2p worker placement, action selection, set collection game where each round you are placing targis (pawns) around a matrix of cards to accumulate goods, tribal cards and perform actions.  Each game is similar in play, but the variability of the cards and decision making over the game makes for an interesting and challenging game every time.

RATING: 7
Rating based on the first couple of plays.

Entertaining take on worker placement and set collection where the point on where your workers intersect gives you that action on the board. The center board is made up of goods cards and tribal cards that are replaced with the other when the card/action is taken while the outer part of the board are actions in which a "Robber" is advancing as a timer and negator of actions. There are opportunities for conflict with your opponent in regards to denying him the actions he wants. Other than that, it seems like another resource conversion and set collecting game. 

The positioning and the benefits of the cards that are being deployed on your personal tableau will dictate your actions for victory points; therefore more experienced players will be aware of opportunities to deny their opponents in that respect. 

The theme and the presentation is top notch and sets the ambience. I need to get it to the table a few more times to see if it has staying power. The rating could go up, but for now it seems like a solid 7.

Perfectly fine, if overlong, worker placement game.  Basically, it is souped up tic-tac-toe where the play is always sub-optimal either due to time spent blocking other players or due to the random and limited choice.

Really enjoyed this 2p game (online only so far). Seems to have quite a lot of depths and allows for (requires) blocking, which is always good in a 2p. Perhaps just a touch too much luck of the draw in whether the sets you are collecting come up to be absolutely perfect for me but not bad.

RATING: 7
Even an utterly unthematic game with just faint traces of a boring setting as Targi can be surprisingly enjoyable: actually, while looking at its components you can’t help but think it’s just another unappealing game revolving round and caring for its mechanics only.

After playing it though you realize you just had a very appeasing game experience: there’s no doubt its mechanics are still the game’s core, yet Targi plays so simple and smooth soon you don’t even notice that anymore and simply try to exploit it, which in the end leaves you with the feeling you just played a heavy game (even though it ain’t heavy at all).

It’s a pity it’s a two-player game only, which alone narrows the chances for Targi to hit the table.

On a side note, a board would have been a better (and more logical) choice for the game in place of the frame to be made with the same twelve cards, especially because their values and position are already set and never change in any game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Simple, smooth mechanics.  Easy set-up and take down of components which is a big plus.  Lots of game in a small box!

Gold, which is needed to build a lot of cards, can be tough to get.  I enjoyed my play of it and since it needs one play to get the feel for it, I'm looking forward to another play.

// Solid 2-player only worker placement game. The state of
the game changes often enough that you can't plan too far
ahead, but there are still some interesting decisions to be
made turn by turn, and the frustration of your opponent
blocking you isn't too crushing because there are almost
always still other viable options.

Played on www.yucata.de

I like it but I expected something more. I don't know what's the problem here but it looks like it's a race for getting tribal cards, and get them in the right way. There are just too few choices when the time comes to place your meeples.

I had this game in my wishlist for one year due to the good ratings it had so my expectations where high... now it's out of my wishlist. I have a bunch of better games for 2 players so I feel like I'm okay with playing it from time to time on yucata.

- a very enjoyable 2-player experience. The placement of tribe members for abilities is a well implemented mechanism. Unsure if there is a first player disadvantage due to having fewer chances to choose a particular action before game end. Will need to play more to be sure.

This game is a small brain burner! What can I say - it is great! It is way much more difficult then Istanbul (for 2 players I won't even open Istanbul now) :O Theme is cool but it is not the most important thing here. The most important is the fact that this is the best game for 2 players I've ever played :) Box is small but inside You will find solid stuff like cards and many tokens (goods, gold, etc.). Negative interaction (blocking only) in the game - keep it in mind.

WOOOOOONDERFUL little 2p worker placement game. This is 2p game where You finally don't have to kill opponent or steal sth.

STRONG RECOMMENDATION!

Got my German copy of the game on the table yesterday and did enjoy the game. Game play is interesting and innovative and there's definitely many things you can try to do to win the game.

Negatives where that game took quite long to play for what it is but this probably in not a big issue when both players know how to play the game properly. I also find it annoying to read a lot of text on the cards (especially in German since it's not my native language). What I'm longing for is iconography which would give the same information but with a glance. This problem decreases when one knows the cards so with multiple plays things should get better.

Interested to give it multiple go's to see whether I'm right or wrong.

EDIT:

Played the game 50+ times in yucata.de and this game is a gem. Deep enough to be interesting and just the right amount of luck to keep it interesting.

Rating to 9.

RATING: 7
A very well-designed, if completely frustrating and aggravating game. Each turn, you can only guarantee you'll get one card you want, and that's only if you're the first player. Usually, you just end up taking random cards that you never wanted, but were using to get the thing you did want, and then you have to figure out what the hell to do with the leftover stuff (which is useful, don't get me wrong!). The Fata Morgana card is thus the most powerful and important card in the game: it occupied so much of our time and attention that I actually would like to have the option of removing it and replacing it with something else. The one-card hand limit is also very constraining, and might cripple you for a couple of turns if you're short on resources.

All of this means that Targi is a good game that is challenging, competitive, and tough as nails, but it's no barrel of laughs. I'd recommend it to someone only if they were prepared to be denied what they want, turn after turn. From a design standpoint, it's probably the best of the Kosmos 2-player line, so I obviously hold it in high regard. I just [i]really[/i] have to be in the mood.

One of my favorite go-to games to play with my wife. The mechanisms are interesting (putting your pawns on the edge for actions as well as taking the cards where those pawns cross each other) and plenty of room to plan for some strategies (and/or disrupt your opponent) while on the other hand there are enough cards to keep the game fresh. Recommended to at least try if you like 2p games.

Use workers to get stuff. Use stuff to buy cards worth points and possibly having minor powers (nothing you'll turn into an engine or a combo). Place cards in sets to get bonus points. Do it all as efficiently as possible.

When game ends, count up your points. Declare a winner. Completely forget any details of the game because nothing particularly interesting happened.

Targi finally got reprinted so I grabbed a copy having heard a lot of good things about the game. However, I don’t think the praise was justified; while it’s a good 2p game, it’s not fantastic. The gameplay is perhaps slightly too simple for my taste. The great thing about the game is how you position your 3 meeples each round, giving you various resources (and using those resources to get buildings, which give you special powers and victory points). It’s so awesome when you place a meeple which blocks and therefore hurts your opponent badly! Just be aware of the damn robber who mess with your plans and block and rob you.

The game can end in two ways, which is always a plus; you don’t just play x number of rounds as the game can end prematurely. This makes it a race for getting that 12th card. I very much enjoyed how you need to arrange those buildings as you acquire them as you get a rather big bonus for getting a lot of the same kind. Also, the fact that the buildings all have special powers is great – more variety always is. Good, but not great 2 player game. I still prefer Agricola ACBAS and will suggest that if playing a short 2p eurogame.

This is just a great game! After more plays there is quite a bit to think about in this tiny box. I have grown to enjoy this very much because it's easy to teach and provides a very engaging game nearly every time! Kind of an abstract game that is a Euro but also has a spatial aspect.

I had heard Targi described as a very solid two player worker placement game. But after one play online, I'm very underwhelmed. The rule of "can't place opposite another player" feels very "gamey" and utterly themeless. In fact, the entire game is totally devoid of theme. 

I simply didn't find the choices that interesting, and what ultimately happens is you block your opponent's best options, your opponent blocks yours, and you end up with very ho-hum actions. 

Bah. I'd rather play something like Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small.

RATING: 6
After a few online plays and I'm glad I got the plays in before buying as it just isn't a game for me although I don't mind playing it online. I think for me the challenge is planning up to 5 actions that just brings out my AP in a way that I don't like. For me I enjoy taking the action immediately with WP games and that doesn't happen here. On multiple occasions I found myself not taking the most optimal action possible and regretting it as I was pulling my pieces off the board when I would see something better. For this reason since I never felt like I could get my optimal plays I imagine it would be even worse playing it in person and there are more enjoyable 2p games I like more.

Light-ish mix of worker placement, set collection, and tableau building for exactly two players. Very much a hands-off/indirect-conflict euro puzzlebox. On the good tip, it's quick, portable and accessible, with a decently warm degree of tactical interest. On the downside, it's, well, yet another game of swapping stuff for other stuff in order to acquire a specific basket of stuff and turning that basket into VPs and it's been done before (and better) in other boxes you've already opened. I liked it well enough for what it was but it didn't go directly to my pleasure centers, either.

First of all, I don't like the artwork. Sure, it's a matter of taste, but I think this game deserves better. There are cards that show tents, but I had to figure this out with the aid of another card that calls them "tents". Before I was enlightened, I thought these cards show giant headpieces. Components could be a little bit better, too. I don't like the fiddly squares with the goods printed on them.
 
In the end all of this doesn't matter, since the gameplay is fun. Only recently I discovered that I made a rule mistake and that the robber skips the edges of the board right after the players give up their goods. It was a happy discovery, because I always thought that the game overstays its welcome.
 
It's not like this game bursts with joy, and it's not like after you play this, you immediatly want to play it again... but there's something to it that makes me return for another session again and again. Maybe because the game offers a bit of everything: worker placement, set collection, resource management...

This a very big game for such a small box.  Interesting worker placement mechanic.  This game is quite satisfying and feel just right for the time it takes to play.  Along with Jaipur, this is one of the best "couples" game I own.  With only 3 resources to collect and use, it is amazing how many strategic possibilities evolve.  Some games have too many choices (Caverna), and some games force you into only one or two choices based upon the randomness of whatever you happen to pick up (Carcassone), but this game seems to find a perfect balance between opportunity and constraint.

It's nice to find a new 2-player game with some unique mechanisms, and Targi is one of them.  The theme isn't really integral, but the gameplay is solid.

Basically each player is placing their meeples one at a time on the outer ring, claiming a good or an action.  Once all are placed, at the intersections of those rows/columns, you place a marker on the appropriate tile and get that good or scoring tile (which costs goods).  As a twist, you can't play a meeple in a row/column where your opponent is already.  Along the way you have to keep an eye out for robbers, and plan where to place your scoring tiles carefully.

This is definitely an enjoyable game, but I have found it becomes a little rote with repeated plays.  So I'll keep accepting offers to play it, but I won't be rushing out to buy a copy.

A brilliant, highly interactive puzzle of a game. For a relatively simple rule set, the tactical options you are presented with each turn are incredibly deep; with each placement you have to consider which border card you want, which central card you hope to get, the ways you can block your opponent, the cards you want to cycle out, the position of the robber on future turns, etc. Every element of this game feels absolutely critical and contributes to its success. There is no part of this game that I don't enjoy.

The only real criticism I have is that some of the tribe cards' abilities can feel a little mundane or predictable. It's a shame that it's strictly a two-player game but there's no way this design could work with more so I can't fault it for that. The production quality and art is sub-standard for a modern game but, given this game's strengths, I don't mind.

This game rejuvenates what had become for me a moribund Kosmos two-player games series. You acquire resources to pay for cards that give you victory points and often some other benefit. If that sounds familiar, it is, but the way the cards and resources are obtained is novel and interesting.

Wow.  This designer knocked it out of the park!  It has instantly become my #1 two-player game, hands down.  

I watched Rahdo's review and in his "final thoughts", he actually kissed the box in his frenzied enthusiasm for the game.  I completely understand his passion for this little game.  It is ridiculously well designed and well balanced.  

As the game progresses, tension builds.  The more you figure it out, the more it can become a cut-throat game, especially the longer it goes on.  And as the game goes on, player turn matters more and more. 

It's just awesome.

Really like the mechanism that you use to block your opponent on this game. Often you are stuck trying to figure out how to best optimize your turn with options you didn't want. Instead of being frustrating, it makes game play more interesting because your opponent is often in the same position.

Two player worker placement game.

Dry and austere theme on this one, which I actually quite like of collecting resources (dates, salt and pepper - what do people season with their spices and minerals, maybe their dates) and tableau building with a dry and dusty desert setting. Art work is flatly average if that's a concern.
Some nice interaction throughout, with lots of weighty decisions and some no-brainers also, which perhaps are a blessing as the game really needs to be - in my opinion - around or just under the hour play mark. First game was just over an hour, which I imagine will reduce dramatically on future plays. If I could get this in in under forty minutes it would rise in my rankings, as it is perhaps the best two player only worker placement game I have played with a short playtime, small box - which is becoming increasingly important; this game has few components, swift set up though doesn't have a particularly small footprint. The rules are easy to grok and gameplay is straight forward. However, I'd rather play all creatures great and small to this as a two player worker placement as breeding sheep and pigs is more fun than collecting dates - no? 
But you are getting a lot of game for the money with this one.

[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
La primera vez que me explicaron la mecánica principal de Tuareg (eso de calcular las intersecciones de filas y columnas para saber qué acciones llevas a cabo) admito que me emocioné bastante, y llegué a pensar que por fin había encontrado un juego para dos jugadores con una estrategia profunda, ese enfrentamiento intelectual que llevaba tiempo buscando. Y por supuesto, la decepción fue monumental.

No solo porque tiene suficiente azar como para estropear las estrategias más delicadas (por lo que te ves obligado a trazar planes bastante genéricos, sin entrar en calcular los detalles), sino porque tras un par de rondas, dicha mecánica principal pierde todo el encanto: ya te has acostumbrado a su funcionamiento, y la verdad es que te empieza a parecer bastante simplona. De hecho, empiezas a notar que todo el rato estás haciendo exactamente lo mismo, y la fase en la que se realizan las acciones se te empieza a hacer tremendamente larga.

Intentamos ejecutar las acciones de manera simultánea para agilizar el asunto, pero es que entonces ya pierdes completamente el hilo de lo que hace el otro y se convierte prácticamente en un solitario a dos jugadores (que sí, que hay algunos choques al colocar los meeples, pero casi ninguno de verdadera importancia).

En resumen, Tuareg me parece un puzzle bastante sosillo, uno de estos juegos que algunos definirían como "sin alma" y en los que todo el rato estás haciendo lo mismo.

Targi is a clever and smooth medium weight 2-player game.  It adds interest to the usual worker placement experience through the intersecting lines action concept and the point opportunities in the 4x3 grid of cards each player collects.  Games are almost always close and the variable card arrangements to give the game plenty of replayability.

2013-06-05 : Tough choices, just the right amount of randomness, this little game has a lot going for it - can become a 6 or an 8 depending on further play
2016-09-09 : Played another game of it that basically was 12 rounds of a knife fight in a phone booth. So tight that 1 sub-optimal round decided the outcome of the game. Looks like a filler, but is actually a main course.

Always on the quest for great two-player games that I can play with my wife, I came across Targi and decided we had to try this one. Success! We both love it. To me it's kind of a mix of Jambo with Race for the Galaxy that works really well. Throw in some worker placement, some cutthroat (not a lot) and cards with special powers and you have a winner in my book. It's not a filler like it could suggest from the box size, but it's not too long either. A great gaming experience in about an hour.

This is a two-player worker placement game that mainly just uses decks of cards. It has interesting gameplay, spatial elements, and serviceable graphic design. My main issue with the game, is that the card powers are mostly dull/lackluster and I have a great many 2 player games that I greatly enjoy. I do think this is a good option however and people should definitely give it a shot if given the opportunity.

Great way to create a board game just with cards and some stones. Good idea to choose the actions by coordinate system. High replayability because of the random effect of the cards. But this is also the lack of the game. It is a taktic game with quite some luck factor. You can do a lot to avoid bad moves - but you can't do anythink to win (that is luck dependent).

A unique 2-player worker placement and set collection game. Many 2-player games are rather simplistic, this one isn't. It's not heavy, but you have to wrap your head around it. Lots of variety through special abilities and a truly elegant design.

A lot of game in a small box with not much material. I like that a lot. I like the matrix system in this game. It's also elegant that the more resource cards that are taken, the more Tribe Cards come out the next round (and vice versa). You need to focus on your opponent all the time, yet try to maximize your own opportunities.  I think that maybe each game will be slightly the same, but I might be wrong. Rating might go up or down with more plays. Minus for missing functional graphics. Miss the names on the cards, and the Tribe Cards could easily have been other colors on the front side than the resource cards. The text on the cards is not that intuitive. Good game, that I easily play again.

It's certainly got solid mechanics and ideas but ultimately it's just a big "meh". Mildly compelling and I could see it as an occasional game with a spouse, but not much more. So many other 2p games I'd rather play.

Getting the tribe cards that grant ongoing bonuses is important in the game. And IMO the card that grants immunity to raids is a bit of a game-breaker if it comes out before the first raid; very powerful card for which there is no effective counter.

Component gripe: When there's a white player color, don't make the robber off-white! Nearly impossible to tell the difference. Paint that bitch fluorescent red.

Really enjoyed this one, where you place your pieces on the fixed cards that form the border to claim the variable cards within the centre at the intersection point. This makes for lots of interesting decisions as sometimes you take lesser actions with your pieces to ensure you get the intersection card you need. 
Well designed in that the border cards are doublesided, one side being a text description of what the card does and the other being an icon depiction of what the card does. 
Turns are fast and the game flows well. Artwork is nice but doesn't cloud the very clean design on the cards.

RATING: 6
Only a 6 for me. Nothing wrong with it. Perfectly adequate game, get stuff, use stuff to get cards, get VPs or discounts on more cards. It just didn't do anything particularly new or exciting. Whilst playing, I was constantly thinking that Jambo was more interesting. Targi is just an exercise in optimal choices and mostly it's fairly obvious what you need and what your opponent needs and tehrefore what you should do next. The only real test was in a couple of timing decisions, when I should have played a meeple on one side before another. 

I won, mainly by dint of getting 12 crads down to my opponent's 11, and by completing both a matched and a mixed row. Otherwise, nothing wrong with it, just nothing especially worthwhile.

RATING: 8
One of the better 2-player Kosmos games IMHO.  This is a solid worker placement game about collecting goods and sets of cards that often provide special abilities. It's unique in that placing a worker doesn't just keep the opponent from placing their worker on the same place - it actually eliminates a whole row or column of placement options.  The "board" is made up of cards and while the outer ring of cards forming the border won't change, the inner section of it is changing constantly.

Not unhappy with this, but there are looming issues. You can't have much of a strategy when the first player dictates availability every round.

Jó kis kétszemélyes játéknak tűnik egy játék után. A játék logikája kicsit absztrakt ám csavaros. Az akciólehetőség egy négyzetrácson helyezkednek el. A lerakott három munkás nem csak a saját három akcióját kapja meg, hanem az akciókra képzelt tengelyek metszéspontjában lévőket is. Így egycsapásra minden mindennel összefüggésbe kerül, ami miatt jókat lehet agyalni rajta.

Two player worker placement game that plays quickly.  Worker placement drives available card options which are either goods (resources) or tribes (victory point drivers).   Very clever blocking as the available card are set by where the placement intersect on a 3x3 grid in the middle of where placement occurs (simpler once you see it versus describing).

Targi is a very interesting 2-player game which introduces a smart worker placement system that also uses coordinate selection to choose actions. There is an element of blocking too which works nice and the board is modular, so each round is different. This game is very tactical, with players needing to alter their approach depending on what comes out each round. It can also be brutal when two players compete. This isn't a bloated game at all, with just the right number of mechanics to keep it flowing. It can be a frustrating experience, and feels a little long for what it is, but overall this is quite a good game.

Not only one of the greats in terms of easy-to-learn 2-players, Targi is also an interesting take on the worker placement genre. Turns consist of nothing more than placing your three Targi on border cards so that you can create intersections on (and potentially purchase) Ware cards or Clan cards. And yet that simple mechanic provides a surprising amount of interesting choices. As game play continues, you struggle to block your partner while creating an engine through Clan card powers that will benefit you in the long-run. Why hasn't this game had a reprint recently?!

Such a cool, different approach to worker placement! The actions are on cards which are laid out in a grid, and you can place your workers on the edges. At the end of the round you can take them and get the actions, AND also the middle cards in the points there they connect. The middle cards are refreshed when they're used.

It's interesting to see a worker placement game designed for two players.

Really nice game! sort of a filler, but with some weight to it. I can feel puzzly -with the moving cards and the building of your tribe to score points at the end-, and some times it makes people go very AP -since you are planning everything in your turn at the beggining-, but for the time it takes, it works great. 
I's interesting and cheap, so if you are looking for a refreshing 2 player game, give this one a try.

Funny - it is actually pretty dry, but I don't feel that, once we play it. Momentary (spring 2012) our 2-player favorite.
I color-coded the cards - something I normally don't do, but first I am sure we will play it often enough, that it really doesn't matter that I also painted the cards and then the code really helps.

Targi is a return to form, or perhaps even exceeds prior standards for the Kosmos 2-Player series, a popular and wonderful series of games.
Targi crosses a worker placement euro game w an abstract style of action selection slightly reminiscent of the Game in the Split Infinity series, where the intersections of locations chosen are in turn selections.
Selected actions grant goods or money or points, or they offer expansions to the tribe which improve later actions and/or garner more points.
All of this plays more elegantly than can be easily summarized.
The game is 16 rounds, or when one player completes tribal expansions.
This makes for a clever, interactive game and one of the very best, perhaps the best overall game in a series of great games.
Starting this at 7.5 on 1st plays, but likely to revisit with future plays under the belt.
Deserving of a SdJ nom, if not an SdJ win.
Terrific game.

Los jugadores colocan por turnos tres de sus cinco trabajadores en el perímetro de un rectángulo de 16 cartas y los otros dos trabajadores vienen determinados por los ejes de coordenadas dónde las filas y columnas de los tres primeros se encuentran. Las acciones del perímetro permiten ir acumulando recursos o cambiarlos por otros y las del centro o bien, son más recursos o bien son cartas de tribu.

El objetivo es precisamente ese: acumular cartas de tribu que dan puntos o habilidades especiales (o los dos) y el juego acaba cuándo un jugador ha conseguido comprar 12 cartas de estas o al finalizar la ronda 16. 

Para liarlo un poco más, hay un ladrón (un marcador de turnos) que bloquea determinadas acciones cada ronda y que en determinados momentos "roba" recursos a las "tribus" de los jugadores.

PROS: Muchísima rejugabilidad.Para ser un juego de dos, es de lo más complejo en gestión de recursos que he encontrado.

CONS: Mucho texto en las cartas de tribu. Una única carta tiene un "ataque directo" contra el otro jugador, pero es muy molesto e innecesario además de descompensante. No tiene nada de especial que no haya en otros juegos mejores excepto su portabilidad. Peligroso con jugadores con Análisis /Parálisis.

RATING: 6.5
Good game for couples.  Has some strategy, but also a strong element of luck with what tribal cards come out.  Offers some opportunity to block and get in your opponent's way, but isn't mean.  Game takes too long for what it is, however, and there are other similar games out there that I would rather play.

Worker placement for 2. Just another optimization exercise. The main twist on WP with this one is that when an opponent selects an action space, she blocks you from that and another space. But in practice you're each just doing what's best for you, and the added blocking just forces you to constantly reprioritize. (I could say the same thing about lots of WP games, but in a two-player game it was all more apparent.) I know some people love that, but not me. 

The degree to which this is a solo affair was apparent on my wife's reaction to the game. She beat me 39 to 31 but was kinda frustrated the whole time, because she knew that on several turns she hadn't optimized fully. It's like we both took a math test, and I got a C and she got a B+, but doing better than me wasn't the point, she wanted an A.  

On the plus side, the rule set is cleaner/easier to learn and teach than most WP games, and the special abilities that come out via the tribe cards are not overwhelming.

Great 2p game. There is really nice balance of fighting for spots while trying to block the other player from getting good stuff. Unlike usual Euros that reward min/max'ing, blocking, I would say is as important as improving your position. You really have to pay close attention. As a result, there is a lot of healthy tension and "what do I do?" moments that give the game surprising depth.

I like the personal tableau where you are trying to line up Tribe cards with like icons or different ones (4 points an 2 points respectively). The tribe cards provide 1-3 points as well as ongoing power up effects or scoring bonuses. 

There is a soft timer where the robber will attack 3 times that you have to prepare your goods for and they get progressively worse. Gold is a premium in this game and is difficult to come by as there are only two gold cards in the goods deck. You can get more by converting them at one of the destinations or if you get lucky with a tribe card's power.

One of my favorite 2p. It lasts just long enough.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (July 2015)

Fun game! I liked Targi a lot. The rules are pretty easy and straightforward, but the gameplay offers very interesting and interactive decisions (basically where to play your workers, but you can block your opponent). You also need to think how to accommodate the cards in your tableau.

The game components are ok. The theme is boring for me and the art is regular.

Playtime is around 30-40 minutes.

Targi has a decent amount of luck. The cards appear at random but at most the first player can try choose one so this doesn’t bothers me. However there are two actions in which you draw a face down card and this does bothers me a bit as this can be a powerful card to get or it can be trash. I feel this can decide a close match and I dislike this feature in an otherwise deep game. I need to play more to see if this is a big issue for me.

I like the robber, it add some tension to the game. Acquiring gold can be hard, I enjoy this.

Bottom line, it is a keeper for me. It has the potential to go up in my personal ratings.

This may be the most satisfying 2 player Euro in my collection.  There's lots of player interaction, planning and second guessing.  Every decision has a bit of angst, and there are many ways to screw with the other guy, and also to attempt to dodge those bullets.  Yet, it's not a nasty game.  It's about collecting commodities and contracts for which you cash the commodities in - but it's the selection mechanism that is really well tuned.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Players collect resources and buy cards with them to fill up a personal display of 12 cards. Each round you place three meeples out onto the perimeter of a 5x5 gird, once placed the intersection points of straight lines drawn from each meeple into the centre of the 5x5 grid define upto 2 additional spaces which you place meeples on (actually cylinders but it doesn't matter).
[ImageID=1402655 medium]

You are not allowed to place opposite an opponent's meeple, you can place opposite your own but it will result in one less meeple in the center of the display.

This blocking mechanic is very clever and much fun to play with. You have to optimize your placement and goals while simultaneously blocking your opponent. The decisions are fairly easy to work through but fun and enjoyable. 

Cards you build have points on them 1, 2, or 3 and the lower point cards often have an ability or one-time benefit. There is also an element of set-collection, filling up a row of your personal display (4 cards to a row) with all the same type of card (oasis, camel rider, etc...) grants a bonus 4 points. Filling up a row with 4 different types of cards grants 2 bonus points.

All of this affects how you and your opponent value cards and gives some nice texture to the decision space. This game is a light 2p set-collection/resource management game with no hidden information (except the order of the draw decks). I have enjoyed playing it but due to the light nature of the game I find it hard to rate it higher than 7. I am not craving games of this or thinking about it in depth.

Worker placement games with 2 are usually either not tight enough, or not varied enough.

Super enjoyable. A huge board spreads out all over the table from a tiny box of cards. The choices are agonizing at times, and the ever-changing inner board keeps things fresh. Chance comes from the draw-off-the-deck spots (exciting) and from your opponent's piece placement (suspenseful). The limit on your tableau spots makes your choices of caravans feel fateful. You constantly have to revise your plans based on what comes up, so it keeps your on your toes, but you always feel that you [i]can[/i] plan, so it doesn't feel frustrating or fatalistic.

A bit of luck and a healthy dose of tactical worker placement makes for a fun, tense 2-player experience. If screwing your opponent out of a resource or card they desperately needed isn't your idea of fun, might wanna avoid Targi, though.

RATING: 8.5
I have just upped this to an 8.5 - the more I play it the more I enjoy it.  The intersection twist really adds a lot to the basic worker placement mechanism. I can't wait for another print of the English language version to come out so I don't have to solely play it on BGA (2.38)

Another solid entry in the Kosmos 2-player series. Nothing that special, but works fine and doesn't take long to play. Main gripe is that interaction is low for a two player game, and when there is some, it's mainly of the "mostly accidentally blocking a move" -variety.

Excellent two player game. 
Quadropolis has a variant on the action selection if you can call it that.
I prefer this over 7 wonders duel because your choices are even tougher.

First game took really long with all the agonizing decisions to be made. But I hope that playing time will be reduced to 50 minutes or so.

Gameplay is engaging all the time so it doesn't outstay it welcome.
Infact if played in less than an hour rating might go up.

The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.

This may be the most satisfying 2 player Euro in my collection.  There's lots of player interaction, planning and second guessing.  Every decision has a bit of angst, and there are many ways to screw with the other guy, and also to attempt to dodge those bullets.  Yet, it's not a nasty game.  It's about collecting commodities and contracts for which you cash the commodities in - but it's the selection mechanism that is really well tuned.

A very unique game; I've never seen a worker placement-esque mechanic like this where there's standard blocking in that you block your opponent on going on the card opposite of your pieces, but also you make it harder for them to get the middle cards in that row/column, while giving you the possibility of doing so via the intersection of your pieces. This adds for several layers of thought of what spot is the best to go to.

Besides this innovative mechanic the theme doesn't come out very strongly, but the tribal cards that score you points do allow you to combo a bit, making at least about half of them not generic. I'm not sure how much the modular board aspect will add variability. If I don't start finding only a few dominant strategies amidst the sea of choices and this game still has a fresh feeling 20+ plays down the road it might even get bumped up to an 8, but we'll see.

EDIT: After 14 plays, this game is definitely starting to feel samey. While you only go through a fraction of the tribe cards each game, each card's individual contribution is not enough to change the general strategy of the tribe card set collection while denying your opponent doing likewise, and ending the game if you get the jump on your opponent (otherwise trying to stall it out). Still a 7 rating, but I think the interesting mechanics could have been so much more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is a favorite. A fresh take on the worker placement thing.  A relatively low resource limit forces players to maintain an interesting balance of accumulation/spending that flies below the low ceiling.  Not quite as much meat as LeHavre, but for a satisfying medium-depth game to play in 45 minutes... it means this gets played a lot.  

Also portable, combined with a relatively fast play time makes it a great cafe/airport game.

Theme is pasted on, but is unique enough to give the game a distinct feel.

This is a very good two player worker placement game where players alternate placing three workers on outside "border" cards.  9 internal cards allow for additional actions where your three workers intersect on the grid for two more actions.  You get more resources from some cards and gain tribe cards where you score.  Tribe cards give you special abilities too.   The game is quick, playing less than an hour.  It is more fun and interesting the Jaipur, even though I like Jaipur a lot.  Great couples game.

What makes Targi special is the spatial grid aspect that it ads to worker placement. I like how you're thinking about where you place your worker and where that will intersect with your other worker. You might take a less than ideal spot in order to be able to grab the perfect card.

Excellent game! Targi is one of the most elegant games I've ever played. The theme is weak if not absent altogether. The components are solid. I appreciate the thick card stock. I also like the fact that setup is minimal. The only knock on this game is the play time. We played our fist game in just over 90 minutes. That's a little long, and makes this game less versatile for us. Hopefully that time will get shorter with more plays. If it does, I will increase my rating.

The worker placement mechanic in this game is the reason i bought it. It is my second favorite game mechanic, behind Pandemic's Intensify mechanic. The intersection of the pieces, and being able to block out your opponent, makes this game a great two player strategy game. I do enjoy the theme of this game, of which it has a bit more than most euros. But this game is all about the worker placement.

Another game we like less than the average Geek it seems (Others being Morels and Love Letter for example). The spatial WP element is kind of neat, but I'd rather have tiles than cards, especially since they have to be picked up from the table constantly, without disturbing the cards surrounding it. We also found it very hard to not forget about the bonuses in our set when there's quite a lot of math involved just to check if your pepper will suffice to buy this card or if you will be one date short to buy another card on your next move, etc. I find it a bit exhausting and oftenly frustrating, although I only had my own bad decisions to blame.

Sold Apr'17.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I am bad at games that require spacial awareness, yet still enjoy and appreciate Targi. The unique worker placement mechanic gives the game a chess-like feel and creates a series of mini tactical puzzles over the course of the game ("If I go here, he'll have to go here, which means I'll have to go here...or if I go here, I'll block him from this, but I'll still have multiple useful placements...hmm").

There is quite a bit of blocking and player interaction without the game feeling cutthroat. One can win without filling the 4x3 grid provided that one scores the row bonuses, uses the silversmith mid-game, and/or scores end-game card perks (1 pt per 2 well cards, card in far-right position, 10 or more cards played, etc.). 

Pacing is also interesting, as you may wish to rush or slow the end of the game based on the current game state. When I have the card that provides a bonus VP for every raid, I might try to block my opponent from buying cards such that the game ends via the 4th raid. When I have two completed rows and my opponent has none (perhaps 3 cards in each of the three rows), I try to rush the end game by buying cheap cards.

05/31/14 Played a 1.5 hour game. 
I liked Targi. But winning does seem to be determined by who is lucky enough to gain early the few special tribe cards that give repeated bonuses. It'll take more playings to see if this is true. For now I rate it a "7". But if I find after several plays it hinges too much on those special cards I may lower my rating. 
06/07/14 Played another 1.5 hour game. The game is supposedly a 60 minute game. I just can't see it ever being that brief.

Great BOARDgame. Open the box and you may think its a card game but its a euro worker placement boardgame with an invisible player board with set rules of placing and scoring tribes you bribed, or influenced or whatever and a market board which is open to both players. If u like games like stone age, castles of burgundy or agricola this will fit nicely in your boardgame collection especially with the desert tribe africa theme.

Cool work placement game where the board is a grid and you place your three workers on the outside of the grid. You can't place on the square directly opposite anybody's worker. After all workers have been placed up to two more placements are added to the middle of the grid for each player at the cross-sections of the border placements.

Basically you're trying to get money and cards with powers to collect sets for scoring VPs. There's also bonuses based on how VP cards are placed into your tableau.

2p, 60min, 2.38/5 [Card Game/Worker Placement]

I love this game. If you do not speak German fluently, I definitely recommend inserting translations in sleeves, or sticking the translations to the cards. It is a surprisingly tactical and strategic game for the small box and relatively low price.

RATING: 7.5
Really nice tension in the decisions. Placing a meeple is a hedged bet for what you really want, but it's also a block and a fringe benefit. And what you really want might be currency or power or points. It's all mixed together in what amounts to a single actual mechanism. Very slick.

Targi almost always hits the table when only two players show up on game night.  It is one of the great two-player games, especially because you must play as much to hinder your opponent's cause as to advance your own.  Delicious!

A big let down for me. It is not a bad game, but it has little to offer me. The fata morgana makes blocking hard, the start player will always get the card he / she wants. The combo potential is limited also with the cards available. I didn't like the randomness that some border cards bring. What remains is set collection with an interesting twist on worker placement. The hour it takes to play is too long for this game with not much depth. There are many games I would rather play in an hour that offer much more than this game. After two plays I traded this game.

RATING: 7.5
After one game I can say this is an abstract but very good 2-player game, both tactical and strategic. If you play for the first time, though, it might be good to have pointed out to you that gold and resources are different things, and thus also the importance of gold. I got stuck halfway my gold as until then I hadn't realized its importance or how difficult it is to get.

Rating will prob go up after more plays.

Original worker placement game for 2 players in which the cards are laid out in a square and the actions you can take are determined by the crossing line of your workers. A very neat mechanism but I got knocked down in my first game... time for revenge! Much better than Jambo in my opinion, which shares the same theme.

RATING: 7.7
Played half a game while supervising child the eldest at an indoor playland while he played with the daughter of the owner; this involved a fair bit of chasing them around as well, of course. We were both trying to learn the game in a noisy environment, with frequent breaks in concentration with cards in German - we used an English print out of card contents. Even in such sub-optimal conditions we both enjoyed the game and thought it had potential.

A week or so later at an open games day we both found ourselves at a loose end and decided to try Targi again in a more game-friendly environment. This was a good decision. We both really enjoyed the way this imaginative and fun little two player game worked. The cross referencing of the way that pieces are placed is fun and adds a great deal of tactical depth while the ‘predictable’ robber element is also fun and adds challenges around planning to an already enjoyable gaming experience.

Targi is a well produced and well thought out little game offering some pretty interesting decisions from the get-go. I really enjoyed my one play and would be up for another try soon. Once the English edition becomes available I will seriously consider this item for purchase.

A not-too-complex, but still some-thought-required worker placement game with a relatively small footprint.

It's a bit lighter than the types of games that my wife & I normally like best, but overall we both found it to be enjoyable. The rules are simple enough, things move at a pretty good pace, but there's a lot of interesting decisions to make throughout the game. There's always more space in our collection for relaxed, light-medium games with interesting decisions!

Add on the fact that it travels well due to its small size and its relatively low price (roughly $20 at US OLGS), and this is a winner.

(Also, the designer of the game is a very thoughtful guy!)

RATING: 8
I love it when I come late to the party and actually find that the positive buzz is actually true. 

Targi is a wonderful addition to the Kosmos 2-player line of games. 

It combines a light visual/spatial worker placement element, which allows players to try and secure certain cards with a set collection and resource management game.

That might sound dry on the surface but it couldn't be any further from the truth. This is a clever game of resource acquisition and the need to balance getting those resources with getting access to various powers is really engaging. 

But don't expect a light fluffy time here either. It clocks in at around the 45 min to 1 hour mark and it is an engrossing, thinky experience...of the best kind possible.

I'll need more time to consider where this fits in with the other games in the series but I can easily say that it sits in the top 5 and possibly top 3 for me.

Not quite as amazing as everyone has made it out to be, but I'll admit that it wasn't nearly as dry as I expected from watching reviews. The positioning of workers is something I found to be very interesting, though it it kind of a bummer than the border cards are static from game to game. If these could somehow be changed up from game to game, Targi would easily be an 8 for me. As it is, replay value is a little on the low side, and the game runs on a little long for what it is. Otherwise, Targi is a solid 2p game.

This is a realy good game and it plays only for two. Clever mechanism of worker placement, where by placing your worker in a certain line or row you close all that line or row for the other player and then you try to put your other two workers in such a way so you create crossroads on the inside of the tableau to take these actions. Great thinking and my congrats to the designer.

Although this is just a 2-player game, which is a genre that typically doesn't appeal to me, this is one of my favorite themes and the artwork is superb. The game isn't very complex with simple rules that are easy to teach, but it is definitely loaded with difficult choices and requires players to adapt to being blocked out of their optimal worker placement locations.

This game is easy to understand, but can be difficult to play well. Rather then developing your strategies, I feel that looking at your opponent's positions and try to foil them as much as possible is more crucial. This cutthroatness of the game might upset some players. I also feel that the limited amount of placement areas make the game a bit restrictive. The game is also slightly lengthy consider its simplicity.

However, the advantage of the game is it plays really smoothly, and casual players can still understand the game without difficulty - the depth is in the games.

RATING: 7.5
In this 2 player desert themed game, there are cards laid out in a 5 X 5 grid. Players take turn placing their 3 meeples at the edges. Where a player's meeples intersect (rwo and column), a counter is placed there as well. Players then get to take actions on their meeples and counters. 

Players are gathering cards, collecting goods, trading for goods or earning VPs. Players put cards into a three row by four column area. If you have the same type of cards in the same row you get a 4VP bonus, wheras if you have all different types of cards you get a 2 VP bonus. The cards also give extra abilities during the game. Each round, a robber figure moves around the edge of the grid to prevent players from placing meeples on that spot, and also force players to answer the demands of the robber with goods or VPs. 

This is fun game to play, with the ability to block your opponent while trying to collect the right sets of cards. There are tough decisions on what cards you want, and what cards your opponent is collecting.

RATING: 9
Amazing 2 player worker placement game. The central mechanism of taking actions spaces directly and getting the more powerful spaces that lie on the intersections of your workers is brilliant and leads to simple rules with very deep game play. Epitomizes the blocking my opponent while achieving my own goals tension that worker placement games allow. Might be even higher in my rankings if I had opportunities to play games with 2 players more often (I mostly play with 4).

The triangulation/biangulation is interesting and it works alright for a 2p. It's a pretty standard euro imo, though not quite as tense or free as others but still decent.

Phenomenal game. Extremely tight worker-placement for two(!) players. Not many games have achieved that! In Targi, you have to plan your moves carefully and anticipate what you opponent is going to do, otherwise you're screwed.

A slightly longish Kosmos two-player game.

Poor development job:
- Insane amount of (occasionally ambiguous) text on cards that should have been made using icons and color coding in the first place. This makes keeping track of card effects needlessly cumbersome and recognizing the opponent's cards nearly impossible.
- There's is exactly one direct attack card in the entire deck. This is really annoying, since the card is both unnecessary and very strong.
- Too few counters. A board would also have made handling the cards less fiddly.

Interessante gioco per due giocatori che nasconde una profondità notevole. La fortuna è rappresentata solo dalla pesca delle carte che andranno posizionate nella griglia che forma il tabellone ma poi entrambi i giocatori avranno l'opportunità per aggiudicarsele. Mediamente il primo giocatore avrà più possibilità di farlo ma a volte a caro prezzo. Il gioco scorre in maniera semplice e veloce (evitate di fermarvi troppo a fare i calcoli, renderebbe il gioco noioso). Tra i migliori giochi strategici light per due.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A classy gaming experience, at the same time feeling reminiscent of the Kosmos 2P classic but equally coming across as deeper and more strategic. The co-ordination and geometry is probably done as well - if not better - than dozens of other games which have been virtually wrecked by a spacial aspect (cf. Key Market, Spyrium) Probably a few too many tribe cards have special abilities, but otherwise I can't find too much to fault at all.

[b]Targi[/b] was received in a math trade (4/14/14).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Excellent 2p only worker placement game.
- The board is laid out in a grid which adds a spacial element to placing your workers.
- Once you place your workers you will get the good/action on that card and the cards where your workers intersect in the grid.
- Cards on the edge are always the same, but the cards in the middle rotate between goods tiles and tribal cards (which award points).
- Tribal cards have different synergies between them.
- When you play a tribal card you also have to consider it's placement in your tableau because this will effect how you score it.

Overall this is an extremely innovative worker placement game that I would highly recommend. It has become one of my favorites and I haven't played another wp game that feels at all similar.[/i]

What an incredibly good 2-player game! This is really good and yet another major hit for the Kosmos 2-player series. It's just amazing what game designers can come up with when confronted with restrictions such as number of players and physical space inside a box.

A fantastic game that I recommend to anybody who plays frequently with only 2 players. Amazing job!

This game is highly overrated.  Nowhere close to being the best two player game in the kosmos series and nowhere close to being a really good two player game.  Not a lot of interesting decisions, and some overpowered spaces that are constant first choices. Very casual game that takes way too long to play.  Might as well bring out a real game. The only advantage this has and I think what everyone likes about it is that it's a small box. If this was in a big box it would be getting a lot more negative comments.  Favourite part of the game for me was selling it for profit because for some reason, it continuously goes out of print.

A very unique two player game due to the spatial aspect of it. I love the jockeying back and forth for position. Great game that unfortunately doesn't get played too often due to its play length. 60 minutes isn't long but when we are looking for two player games, we are usually looking for something shorter.

First played it on Board Game Arena (Thank you arena!).

I must say the games I prefer are more on the light side. This one tries to be light and bring you a flavor of heavier worker placement games.

In my opinion it succeeds. Light enough – Heavy enough. 
I can see why sb wanting one or the other may be unsatisfied but for me it has exactly the right portions to satisfy my tastes.

I must admit that when I first played I wasn't all that keen on reading all that text on the cards, but it took only a couple of games to get over it. Now I even have my favourite cards. The designer should include some quick reference icons on the tribe cards.

The quality of the card board tokens, coins and points is OK, but I would prefer they would be wooden.

Clever mechanics. Portability. Enjoyed some tough matches. Not fantastic, but good enough! 

I heard a rumor of an expansion. Bring it on!!!

(Wife's Point of View: She finds it cute. She was afraid of it at first, but now she even asks for it sometimes. Hit!)

I am usually negative to two player games, since with only one opponent it looses a lot of dimension. 

That said I really like this game. It's simple but still very strategic. It has just the right amount of randomness and resource management/build mechanics that I like.  

But it's also lacking variation, every game becomes similar; ie don't play it too often, but for an occasional semi-filler it's ok.

RATING: 8
This game has some excellent brain burn to it.  You really have to choose your action placements wisely, to make sure that the combination of actions you get each turn are actually useful to your strategy, and also hopefully work well with each other each round.  And all the while, your opponent's placements are going to screw up your plans!  Lots to think about in such a small, easy to understand game.  Excellent!

Based on one play: You play your tokens around the board and the place where they intersect determines the tiles you can take. Using the ressources you gather you buy tiles that give you points and when you make them into sets you get even more points. It was quite fun and I found the mechanics to be quite interesting.

RATING: 7
The amount of depth to size of box is pretty high.  The combination of worker placement and spatial considerations is very clever and the game will be interesting for quite a few plays.  I played about 100 times on BGA and got burned out on it a bit.  I discovered Spyrium which also adds a spatial element to the worker placement idea, though Spyrium is perhaps closer to an auction mechanic than a worker placement one.  I still like Targi, but would most likely reach for Spyrium instead.

Fairly light and non-confrontational and good as a couple's game as it's hard to get a runaway winner. Slightly over-long for the amount of game and not quite delivering on the innovation of the grid, but it's engaging enough for a low-brain-power end-of-the-working-day game.

1 play; Rating -8- Targi was nominated for the Kennerspiel des Jahres last year. Considering the jury for all the German awards seems less willing to give the nod to 2-player games, my interest was piqued. After hearing more rave reviews, I was delighted to find that the game had come to yucata for online play. I gave it a shot there and then pre-ordered. The game is quite simple and rather fascinating. To set up, players arrange border cards in a large rectangle and then fill the 3x4 center with two types of cards. Tribal cards are collected by the players and played into a personal display where they provide points and, sometimes special abilities. Goods cards are the way that players collect resources in order to pay for tribal cards. On each turn, players alternate placing their three Targi meeples on the border cards. Then, the players place additional markers on the inside cards at the locations where the rows and columns with their Targi meeples intersect. Next, the first player resolves all of his actions, then the second player does the same. Rinse, and repeat for a prescribed number of rounds and the game is over. There is also a robber who moves around the border, blocking certain action spaces (the border cards either provide goods or let the players take special actions such as trading goods or buying points). When the robber reaches each corner of the outer rectangle, there is a raid. At this time, the players must give up the required ransom, or face a point penalty.

I love this game. It takes about an hour to play, is easy to teach, and has some decent depth. The placement of the meeples creates some agonizing decisions. Because of the limited number of spaces though, it doesn't slow the game significantly. I'm looking forward to playing this one many more times.

A good solid two-player euro that is confrontational by design (we keep on blocking each other just by doing our own thing) and a bit frustrating for my fiancee. It challenges my spatial awareness by forcing the player to connect the dots before you lay down the action marker. It is an unique twist on the worker placement mechanism because you don't exactly know where your worker will end up before you place every single one of them down. It does require to think ahead and try to figure out what your opponent is trying to do.

I do enjoy it for it being what it is. I don't know if this can hit the table again before being sold/traded. :shake:

---- Update ----
Wife beat me in our second game together. Played with the Josh-variant proposed by the designer Andy. What a great guy. We started with 3 gold in our tableau and it sure makes the game more relaxed.

This is another game Riley let me borrow. I have seen it around a lot it gets a bunch of praise around here, on BGG. Since it is strictly 2p I wanted to see what it was about. I did really enjoy this game. I just don't know how much replay value it has for me and Ron. I can see it getting SAMEY, but I would definitely play it again. One of the better games Riley let me borrow to try. It also seemed a bit too long but that might chance with more plays.

P: 2 only, T: 60 min, KenSdJ-N, On BGA

Clever action selection/worker placement mechanism, combines with modular board. Typical Euro feel: worker placement, resource gathering, VP engine/maximization. Medium light but highly strategic/tactical with almost low luck influence. Demands a lot of blocking actions to play well, but little 'take-that' aggressiveness. Availability concerns; reprint coming?

An excellent couple's game. Not as simple as say, Dragonheart, but has a some amount of luck and a good deal of strategy (in terms of collecting and using resources). The learning curve is very manageable even for beginning gamers and this might be a good gateway game for couples and more so if one of them is already a gamer who reads and explains the rules.

The theme and mechanics tie in quite well and given the card layout and the moving robber figure on every turn, you do feel that you are roaming the desert, collecting resources and trading them in your quest for victory.

Now, this is one that is even better on Boardgamearena when you can put down a game in 25-30 minutes. However, there is nothing like in person even though it takes 50 minutes to an hour. This one comes close to overstaying it's welcome at an hour, but I really enjoy it. It is some pretty heavy thinking with some fairly cut throat play that doesn't offend the euro player that doesn't like conflict. Overall, I find it to be an elegant design, and one of the best made for two player games I have played. Still it is around a 7.5 for reasons I can't completely explain. I really like it, but I would probably not play it but every 2-3 months with the other games in my collection. ***Wife:7

I caught wind of this game after watching the Dice Tower's top 10 two player strategy game list. I believe this game was near the top of Zee Garcia's list. Since my gaming tastes are pretty aligned with Zee's I looked into this game further. After watching Rahdo's run through and hearing his praises of Targi, I new this was a must have before even playing it myself. This is my favorite two player only game for several reasons. 1. It's worker placement with a brilliant triangulation mechanic 2. You have good choices without too many choices that induce AP 3. Plays in about 60-75 minutes 4. Only costed $20 5. Nice looking art work on the cards and box 6. Easy to play and teach 7. The idea that dates can be as popular as salt and pepper.

Good 2P game.  Simple and light in that you only place 3 workers per turn.  It's part of "Phase 2" of worker placement (to coin a term)....where the worker you place not only receives what he is placed on, but also gets add'l benefits.

You collect resources and coins and turn them into victory points.   You also collect various tribe cards for even more VPs.

Really good implementation on BoardGameArena.com.  I've played it more than 10 times at that website.

11-09-2014. Rated after 1 play. Targi is a 2 player worker placement game. It's a very elegantly designed game, and features random setup (since the board is cards) and a cool block-your-opponent, take an action mechanism because you try to intersect the lines on your tokens make on the board. For me, the game falls a little flat because it feels for me there is no point to your actions, no goal except get VPs which doesn't appeal to me.

I thought it was a light/medium game. Wrong! After a lot more played games, it is definitely a medium game. The constant challenge to get resources, your victory points and blocking the opponent in a balance, needs your complete concentration. Two rounds without you fully concentrated will result in guarantied loss.

We love it!

It is a light/medium game. I would not have nominated it as the Kennerspiel des Jahres. But it is definately fun. We really like to play it. Besides Battle Line it is the most played two player game (wife and i) in our house.

Good little outthinking game with an elegant card grid mechanism. You place your meeples around the edge of the grid on certain fixed action cards and where they intersect you can permanently take that action or goods card.

So the board keeps changing. There's balancing acquiring the goods you need with the action cards available with scoring considerations (sets or mixtures of card symbols).

All good stuff in less than 30 minutes. Less fiddly than Jambo and with a nice little mechanism for a simple little game like this. An excellent addition to the Kosmos two player line and one of my favourites in that series, but still behind Hera and Zeus (even if that game is crippled by having no text on the cards).

RATING: 8
A hidden gem. The perfect game to play with your mate, since it is pretty competitive, but doesn't have any direct confrontation. Besides, it shows one of the most original implementations of the worker placement mechanic, in which players are allowed to perform the actions of the spaces where they place their tokens, as usual, but also the ones located in the imaginary interceptions between them.

Fun 2p card game with some nicely combined elements.  Has some blocking involved as well as a nice tightness to it.  The robber adds to the blocking as well as stealing resources/pts.  My 7-year old daughter picked it up quick, so that raises it higher in my book.  I like it.

Targi, is a nice abstract for a more shallow experience.

RATING: 6
Played twice. Targi's approach to worker placement is quite novel; workers are placed on the perimeters of a grid, and the points at which their lines intersect creates another action for the player. A fair bit of contemplation is required as players have to consider both their desired actions on the perimeter and in the grid, as well as potentially blocking moves of the opponent.

Unfortunately, Targi is heavily tactical for a longish game as most actions are dependent on the random draw of cards every round, and the resource conversion bit is rather pedestrian in design. This puts Targi in direct competition with other resource conversion games of the same weight and playing time – games like [thing=34635][/thing] and [thing=143693][/thing] – and Targi cannot match its competitors in terms of depth. Its unique 2P worker placement mechanism is undoubtedly clever, but the overall package is not quite impressive.

Great small game. it seems simple at first but it gets very tricky the longer the game goes. There was a lot of swearing at me from the wife while playing because of my blocking some of the things she wanted. even after all the anger she loved the game.

Targi is a Euro worker placement game for 2 players only that plays in 45 minutes or less. You place workers in order to gain cards into your tableau. The game would be lackluster if not for the special abilities some cards grant. They make the game really shine and offer variability and depth.

Interesting mechanics. It's very unforgiving of mistakes. I feel like there is a very large luck component (more than in Stone Age, but less than in ... um, cribbage? about the same as Jaipur). Player ratings on BGA suggest that either the skill cap is low, or the players have a long way to go towards getting better. For Michelle, it's an 8.

A lot of strategy packed into this simple 2 player game but it's rating suffers due to lack of playtime with only 2 players...else, it would probably rate a 7 or higher.

RATING: 7
Slightly dry, hard to figure out a good strategy, a bit confusing at first. The worker placement system keeps longish analysis at bay (at least the way we play), which is necessary, as effects are rather complex. Effect timing is not so much of an issue, which in turn keeps decisions from getting too complicated.

Un des gros points forts du jeu réside dans la simplicité de son déroulement. On fait face à plusieurs choix importants très rapidement et on doit improviser en jonglant avec les stratégies possibles. Je trouve que parfois, au début d'une manche, il peut être difficile de trouver comment s'orienter et de choisir par quoi commencer pour obtenir les cartes désirées.

On place chacun 3 pièces, à tour de rôle, à des endroits stratégiques sur un contour formé de 16 cartes rempli de 9 cartes de biens et de tribu qui sont pigées. Il faut accumuler des ressources pour garnir son aire de jeu avec des cartes de tribu mais en même temps, il faut toujours être prêt pour payer le Robber qui vient voler des ressources à chaque 4 tours. Il faut réfléchir rapidement et savoir s'adapter aux cartes qui sont pigées à la fin de chaque manche afin de remplacer celles qui ont été réclamées.

Même si c'est un worker placement à seulement 2 joueurs, le jeu donne un sentiment d'être limité car on doit absolument compléter des intersections entre la portée de 2 workers. Les possibilités de placer confortablement ses marqueurs de tribu pour obtenir des cartes au centre du jeu deviennent de plus en plus claires (et limitées) au fil d'une manche. Aussitôt qu'une manche finit, on a envie de recommencer au plus vite la prochaine. 

J'ai vraiment apprécié le jeu. Simple dans sa composition mais très profond.

Sokak által legjobb kétszemélyes játéknak tartott Targi tényleg jó, de én nem érzem kiemelkedőnek a Patchwork, 7 Wonders Duels, Battle Line trió közül. Három jóemberünkkel választunk akciót egy 5x5-ös mátrix sarkainak kivételével a szélein elhelyezett fix akciómezőkből és ehhez a három akcióhoz jöhet még 1-2 az embereink metszéspontjában levő belső akció. Háromféle nyersanyag, pénz gyűjthető, amivel törzskártyák vehetők, amik győzelmi pontok mellett még különböző előnyöket is adhatnak. Ezek magunk elé helyezésének sorrendje adhat még pontot a játék végén. Vagy 12 ilyen kártya megszerezésével vagy 12 kör után ér véget a játék. 30-45 perc azért van egy-egy parti. Negatívumaként ez utóbbit tudom felhozni, mert a korábban említettek rövidebb játékok, illetve a szerencsefaktort, ami bőven jelen van. Ettől függetlenül kellemes játék a Targi.

Meh. It's an ok game, but too themeless for me. (Yeah, I should have known.) It also seems a bit random. If you score a few bonus cards it seems to give you too much of an edge against your opponent. No desire to delve deeper into this one.

A neat little 2-player game of set-collection and worker placement with simple rules but still some interesting decisions. There is some randomness in the cards, though, which may be an issue since you get bonuses for specific combos.

--- Summary ---
The play area is a 5x5 board (created with cards) where the outer 16 spaces are always the same, and in the same order. A Robber token starts in one corner. The inner 9 (3x3 grid) are filled in with a random mix of tribesman- or goods- cards. Goods cars show 1-2 goods (salt, pepper, or dates; rarely, a gold coin). Tribesmen are in one of 5 types, cost some combination of goods/coins, and are worth a base 1-3 VP (some also have 1-2VP bonuses for certain conditions). Players start with 2 of each good, 1 coin, and 4 VP.

Each round, players alternate placing their 3 meeples on spaces around the edge (not corners). Then, their workers are placed on the intersections of the rows and columns of their meeples. Then, each player resolves all their meeples and workers in any order; this is usually either collecting goods/coins or taking a card into hand. If took card (max hand size = 1), may play it immediately into your tableau (3 rows of 4, starting from left edge of each row) and resolve its effect -- some occur immediately while others have ongoing effects (e.g., discounts on playing some cards). The action spaces on the edge include abilities like converting goods to coins or VP, gaining/playing a card, etc; as well as simply acquiring goods. The used cards in the central area are replaced: goods cards are replaced with tribesman, and vice versa.

At the end of each round, players must discard goods in excess of 10, and coins in excess of 3. Then advance the Robber marker clockwise; if it lands on a corner space, players must pay either goods, coins, or VP. Then advance the Robber. 

The game ends when the Robber has made a complete circuit (12 rounds), or if a player has completed their tableau. Players get bonus VP: 4 for each row with only one type of card; 2 for each row with only different types. Also, may get bonuses from cards in tableau. The player with the most VP wins!

Excellent game. Everything that I expected out of it. Components are mostly cards with just a few odd bits, but it feels like a full worker placement game, and that's because it is. The game also feels like a combinatoric abstract games, because of its spatial element, which is also enjoyable and is what allows it to function as a full fledged two player WP game.

One complaint though is the box size, which is way too big for its components. The card divots accommodate over twice the amount of space needed for the cards, which would be fine if the corners of the divots weren't rounded because that prevents sleeved cards from being placed inside of it. The box overall is way too big for everything. A box the size of Jaipur's would have been sufficient for storing everything. Shame that I had to toss it out because I really liked the cover art.

Received from the PIFF-train. Such a great game!

Update 2017-06-30: I've lowered my rating from a 9 to a 7. I still really like the game, but it does drag on for a little bit too long. I think the main problem is that there is absolutely no arc in the game. The first couple of rounds play out exactly like the last couple of rounds, and it starts to feel repetitive about half-way through.

Update 2017-10-06: Still feel about the same about the game as per the update above, but I'm generally adjusting my ratings, based on how much I actually like to play the game, and I'm a bit bored with this one.

A nice job has been done giving some weight to the competition for opportunities, a tricky proposition in a two-player game.  After our first game, we have been impressed with the scarcity of gold and found that we sought very different goals in our second game.  Hopefully our skill sets will converge as we get to know Targi better and this will become a long-running competition.

1 play on BGA.  We kinda dove straight in without the rules, so take the rating with a grain of salt.  Once we understood what we were doing, it seemed like a pretty good game.  Crosswise action selection is a neat mechanic, and it played really quickly.  Rating is likely to stay the same or go up.

Wow! Finally got to play this hidden gem after it being on my radar for quite some time but always being superseded by 'hotter' games. And what a game it turns out to be. This game has spatial challenges, an element of outguessing your opponent, resource management, set collection, unique player-specific actions, changing action space each turn and some luck. All of that in a small package with huge replayability.

It got played after a game-night with two other small 2p games as competition: the current hotness (7 Wonders Duel) and last year's hype (Morels). I fully expected it to come out as the most dull but instead found myself wanting to play this again. 

Two caveats. One is the playing time, which racked in almost clocking two hours. Of course, it was already past twelve, it was our first game and as die-hard gamers we were figuring out the complete action space each turn instead of just taking whatever available and making something of it. So turns took quite a while, can see the playtime going down to the stated hour after some more plays but will have to play more to verify.

Second is the weight: it seems quite heavy. This is both a bonus as a drawback for me, as not much 2p games have that weight without becoming boring and mathematic, but it is definitely not a game I'd play with my non-gamer wife. So that will hurt the time it will actually get played.

But boy, am I pleasantly surprised by this game. Will hunt this down to add it to my collection.

I hardly play any 2-player games. Mostly there's 3 or 4 of us. So this wasn't on my buy list. But I kept hearing great things about it so I decided to give it a try with the online version to get a feel for the game.
Every turn in this game is just so tight. You need to secure certain spots on the board in order to get your stuff done, but you can only place one marker at a time, only getting you 50% along the way of securing that very spot. And mostly you need more than one spot, so you need to optimally place your markers. This is a fun challenge that keeps the game fresh and challenging.
I was quite impressed with Targi and if I ever need an extra 2 player game, this one will be on the top of my list!

I had really high hopes going it- reviews were that this was a very solid 2p game. So we sat down with it and discovered- a disastrous rulebook and a game that, at least for me, wanted to be a heavier game than the design could support. My husband thought better of it, but still thought that just one more 'thing' need to be taken away from the design. It plays like a much more complicated Builder's Duel (which is fine, we love that game) but otherwise I didn't feel particularity engaged with the game play.

I like how you choose your actions. By placing your pawn your take one action for sure, block one action for your oponent (apart from that you take) and choose a row or column from that you will have another action. Everything in by placing one of your pawns.

The scoring is also clever. You will have 4 bonus points for a row with cards with the same symbol, but 2 bonus points wit a row of cards with different symbols and no points for another combination of cards.

A fairly fun game and one of the most Euro style/worker placement type games we own.

A great two player worker placement game that is packed with competitive decisions. On one hand, you can very easily block opponents from getting the cards they want, but to continue to do so, round after round, ends up wasting your own actions too.

My one complaint is that I feel the cards that grant bonus resources seem overpowered. I guess it works out because, as I mentioned above, you can keep blocking, but they are very strong.

Nifty little two player worker placement game.  It features trading specific goods for special power cards/points.  It's worker placement is an interesting grid system which players use the outside 12 spot (corners don't count)on 4 x 4 grid to place and also place workers in the row intersections.  It's fun, and I'm curious to see how it holds up to repeat play.

Targi is a two player game with an unusual "board".  There isn't actually a board, simply a layout of tiles, with a border ring that never changes and an inner area that is replaced as tiles are taken.  On your turn you alternate placing three workers on the outer ring.  You take the actions of the spots your workers occupy as well as the column and row intersections of your workers.  It's all about gathering resources to accomplish "tribe" tiles for points.  It's simple but surprisingly brilliant.

Excellent two player game that checks a lot of boxes: easy set-up and break-down, good strategy/tactics blend with a slight bit of luck, good pace and length, good mid-weight Euro feel. No negatives that I can think of. We'll see how we feel about it over time.

After quite a few more plays: Yeah, this one is going into steady rotation. We both like it a lot.

This is a worker placement game that grabs your attention and keeps it until the end. Tactical play emerges from interesting decisions. The robber changes the available spaces and can take resources. Amazing that Targi is the designer's first title.

RATING: 7
As described by others, this game is a relatively straight forward worker placement game for two. Workers are placed around the border of a grid system. Apart from primary benefits gleaned from placing your workers around the border tiles, secondary benefits of worker placement come from intersects of your workers in the interior tiles of grid system. Placing workers denies your opponent of the particular border tile ability but also other goods and cards in the interior row or column where your worker is placed since no other workers can be placed on any of those border tiles.  As expected, benefits come in the form of goods and tribal cards which are icons with special benefits. These cards are then placed in your personal tableau in a grid like system ala Vikings/Hawaii.

I am on the fence about this game. First, as a two player game in the Kosmos series, it feels a bit too long and dragged out. The two player games in this series should be short and sweet. I do enjoy the worker placement, but it is nothing that spectacular. The blocking aspect does add a layer of choice to the placement, and it appears that the game encourages blocking as a viable if not important aspect to victory. Depending on your level of aggression and desire for conflict, this game may work for some but not for others.

Oh yeah, kudos for selecting the choice of goods : salt, pepper and dates. A refreshing change from gold, wood, stone, ore, wheat...etc.

I like Targi more each time I play it; it is a great two player only game. It is complex enough to demand my attention to detail, but it is not tedious. I love the way players expand their tribe and acquire goods, gold, and victory points. My wife and I have a short version of the game where we begin with the robber on space "7" instead of "1". Our scores are lower, and it's tough to complete the 12 card tableau. But our short game lasts 20-30 minutes versus 45 for the standard game. Targi is excellent and essential for gamers who primarily play two player games.

this is an awsome 2p game; finally a 2p only game with a desert theme that offers some tough choices and does not rely on randomdess alone (Jaipur, Jambo & co).
I think 2p are great to introduce modern board game mechanics to new players, this is not the first 2p game I would suggest to a non-gamer but definetly one I would want to go towards (before going further to Innovation ^^)

[+] great action selection mechanic, nice resource management, good replayability, lots of choices to make
[-] you might start a set and never see a 4th card pop up... blocking and even discarding cards that benefir your oponent is a big part of the game, can be frustrating for non-gamers

play on BGA

PS: rating might go up with more plays

One of the best 2 player games i have seen so far. Simple, fast, your moves have an immediate effect on the opponent and you have to use your abilities as good as possible if your want to win. The system with which two of your "workers" are placed is unique and very interesting. A great value for money, even though it is -basically- a card game. You should give it a try.

If I play 2 player games with my wife the first choice is usually Targi. The game is highly variable, there's some chance but not too much and there are many possible stratgies to play the game with. It is never boring even if we play it several times in a row - and to think we had this one lying in the basement for a long time before opening it!

RATING: 7
A really clever worker placement game with a brilliant action selection mechanism. It's definitely one of the most original 2P games I've ever played. I'm not so sure about it's long term replayability though as your strategies tend to be rather similar. Also, I wish Targi was a little shorter - it tends to exceed 60 minutes which is a lot for a small game like that.

[b]/update, January 2018:[/b] Downgraded from 8 to 7 - Targi is very cleverly designed, but most of my plays felt rather samey. The spatial puzzle is great, but it no longer keeps me as involved as it used to during first plays.

EDIT: Lowered to 6:not so bad but very cumbersome to play for what it is and it seems too restrictive, not many moves among which to choose... and luck is sometimes too important

a good and relatively simple 2 players card game. it's ok, it flows well, has a good rhytm.
Why not a 7? it doesn't give me anything particularly good at the moment. There is some strategy, some interesting decisions but... it doesn't shine yet. Rating could raise after a few games.

Middle East themed worker placement of the Tuareg tribes  with camel caravans and harvesting salt, pepper, and dates.

RATING: 9
Wow, this game is so complex for just being a small two player game with only cards, some tiles and a few meeples – not even a dice! First, we passed on it because it seemed a bit sallow from what we gathered from the pictures on the packaging. But when it got nominated for German 'Kennerspiel des Jahres' award it attracted our attention back again.

Targi features an innovative and quite unique way to gather your stuff by placing your meeples on the outer cards. The placing feels very tight and is always intense and exciting. Not many different possibilities if your opponent knows what he is doing. The game is not overly strategic, but very tactical. You especially have to make yourself clear what you really want and what you only would like to have before making your turn. In the end it is just acquiring the resources you need for buying the desired tribe cards to gain points. But there are always more options to choose from than you truly can optain. Plus it is best to acquire the needed resources and get the desired tribe cards in the same round as the games moves on very quickly.

One thing I do not like is the fact that everything is just made of cards. The outer frame could also have been one foldable piece. Also the cards could have been made of thicker cardboard like the resource tiles. It can get a bit tedious to adjust all the cards again each round. But this is only one negative point concerning the physical realisation of the game. The mechanics itself are spot on and can hardly be improved. Very good balancing, too. Gold seems scarce, but if you know how to get it this is no problem at all and makes the game even more intense. Highly recommended for players who seek a very tatical and quite complex gaming experience for two players only.

Many of my favorite games allow or encourage players to not only make the best move for themselves, but also foil their opponent(s) at the same time. Targi looks all sweet and innocent, but it certainly has this feature going on. Maybe I really want a certain set card in the middle, but I also don't want my opponent take a particular action that's in a different row/column. What do I do? This tension makes me completely engaged throughout the entire turn. I want to know what my opponent does, plans to do, and speculate on how he's going to build his tableau. 

The grid layout in this game with players picking rows and columns is quite neat and a mechanic I'd love to see more of in other games. I also tend to like tableau-building games and the tableau in Targi offers a nice personal puzzle for myself away from the tension of the main board.

This is one of the best medium worker placement games out there for two players only. You constantly have to balance defense versus offense. It is a very cool set collection and resource management game.  The grid system of cards is clever.  You are always trying to intersect in the optimal areas, while still blocking your opponent out of the good spots.  I love that the border cards are powerful and unique and the the board is changing every round.  The robber is also a nice aspect of the game because you have to avoid his presence which adds a little extra depth to your tactics. Gold is always valuable in the game.  The set collection aspect is nice because you choose how to set your cards...in sets of four of the same or four different.  Four of the same is harder to collect against a skilled opponent but is much more valuable during end game scoring.

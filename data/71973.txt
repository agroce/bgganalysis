I really like this game.  It's very abstract, but the theme works well with helping you understand what's going on.  It's a game that's very susceptible to AP, but that might go away as people understand it better.  I've only played with 3, and I need to play with 2 and 4.  But it gets a thumbs up from me so far.

Pleasant little game that plays quickly and has some great wooden bits.  May buy this just for the crows.  Fun for playing with kids, even though they smoked me.  12 year olds had no problem getting understanding this one quickly.  Reading the rules and figuring those out seemed to take longer than playing the game.

Rating 6: for four players.

Initial Impression: This tile laying game replaces Carcassonnes for me. It seems to move faster, there's a bit more to consider when optimizing points for scoring, and the mechanisms are fairly thematic for this semi-abstract game. Best of all, the kids like it too. The inter-player conflict in this game feels more direct than it does in Carc and with the special tiles there's definitely more opportunity to mess with your opponents' ability to score. I love the dark artwork, the wooden crows, and the shiny bits!

There's a balance between luck and strategy. In most games being startplayer is every turn good or everytime bad but here sometimes it's good to start or it's very bad depending on the fact of a troop swarmed out in the previous turn or not. Plays like a tactical game but there's in fact a portion of luck involved. Still it's fun to play.

I really like this game. Not a carcasonne ripoff as I have heard however it does have tile laying. Be cleaver when to use your tokens. Player 1 is certainly at a disadvantage on this game. but it rotates so everyone gets a chance.  I did Play this wrong as Garbage tiles replace tiles we did not play that way. But that changes the dynamic of the game. I wish the rules had bigger font. Very tough to read the rule book. Also Players aids on bonus tiles would have worked as well. It's great I highly recommend it.

Some turns, this game presents some really interesting decisions / competitive-puzzles. But many turns, it doesn't seem to, instead presenting fairly obvious best choices... which is a shame, because the thought-provoking turns are nice. It seems to happen most often in early game when the board is small, and when crow groups are just shy of forming a murder. It's possible that more insightful play (planning further in advance) and/or using the More Crows variant will help keep the board more interesting.

Excellent visual presentation; very atmospheric.

Decent abstract tile-laying game in which you need to play carefully so as not to draw attention to what you are doing, since that will surely cause other players to divide and conquer.   Plays slowly but thoughtfully.   There are some fiddly components to deal with in moving the birds all around.  Actually, the crows don’t stand up, so they look more like seals.

This really isn't a game for me.  Luck on the tile draw seems to play too big a part alongside the effect of the trash tiles distorting how many turns people get.  I'd much rather play Carcassonne.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A little disappointed in this one as the turns get quite repetitive, possibly will house rule that you get a hand of two tiles rather than the luck of the draw from the top of the deck.

Very tactical and no strategy whatsoever. Play was gives you the most instant gratification and think about next turn , next turn.

Theme really fits the game play very well and I do like the muted gloomy colour scheme of the whole game.

The shiny things are really nice however a playing piece with a flat bottom for the scoring track would have been good as the shape of the shiny pieces means they get knocked and move around on the score board a lot.

Component quality is good however the rules are written in tiny font so its hard to read them, a slightly bigger font spread over more pages would have made things a little easier.

The box had no shelf appeal for me, nor did the photos here on BGG.

I friend broke out his copy, and I never turn down a game.  This is a solid family game with good strategy involving some planning ahead.  There is luck in the tile draw.  

The theme is beautifully carried out through clever mechanics.  The crows flock, line of sight, to the nearest bright object--the brightest one being a tie breaker.  A gathering of six or more becomes a murder of crows (the proper name for a group), and two mate and leave, and the rest take off in a spiraling circle.  There are cemeteries and trees that are placed on the board with varying numbers of crows.

Valley Games puts out a quality game that even shows in the much appreciated, extra sturdy, box and the components--in this case nice wooden crow meeples.

I like tile games and this delightful game is one I want to get.

RATING: 6.5
I didn't enjoy this tile-laying game quite as much as I was hoping, but it's not a bad game. There's some challenge in knowing where to position the tile you're given to place each turn and which tile to put your gem on within the ever-expanding board to attract the most crows based on the row and column. It ends up being rather abstract, but not an especially deep abstract. It plays a little long for what it is, but I think I'll enjoy it better and it will go quicker as a 2-player exercise than with 3 or 4.

WOW, this game turned out to be even better than expected. It can be a bit thinky and some players, will suffer from a little AP at times, but once you get the game down and realize the strategies. The AP will become lessened. At first I thought this would be a nice light game, but it's a little more than that and even played a little longer than expected, which turned out to be a good thing. It wasn't too long and didn't overstay it's welcome. I've only played with 2 players and it was great. I'd like to try it with four, to see how that goes. I suspect it'll be a little more chaotic and harder, to try and plan ahead a move or two. Like you can with two players. Though I think it'll still be fun and will update this, once I've played a four player game.

This game is nothing like Carcassonne. Except for the tile laying. Heck I even like it better than Carcassonne. The components are nice, with heavy cardboard tiles. a few acrylic gems and of course the awesome crow meeples (Creeples). I highly recommend this game. It's a bit under rated in my opinion.

Many thanks to ColtsFan76, who'ss video review of this game got me interested enough, to purchase the game.

I thought moving crow meeples every few turns was tedious until I played Zombicide. OK. That's the only similarity between those games! Wait! Creatures are attracted to you and come your way but with shinies instead of noise. OK. That's the only other similarity between those games! Crows is simple, has chunky components, and thick tiles. Not competitive enough with two, but I bet it plays three well.

Crows is an interesting tile placement, set collection game, designed around attracting crows to shiny objects placed by the players.

Crows move to the nearest, orthogonally visible shiny object which has an available path, or if they aren't distracted by some other object.

The point of the game is attracting crows, which distribute over the board from time to time.

Players take turns placing tiles, and then shiny objects- figuring out the best placements, or the ones that block most players from crows is the point.

All in all it's an interesting game, but I don't find it especially deep or satisfying after a few plays.

Starting this at a 6.75- solid effort, but not super shiny to this bird.

Good, solid, and unique abstract game with great artwork.  This is one of my games that definitely gets pulled out every year leading up to Halloween.

This is minor, but I really don't like the two plastic jewels used as a player piece and score marker.  They're so hard to pick up.  I really dislike it when publishers include these things in games.  I need to replace them with something more thematic; something that's shiny.  Great crow bits but wish they were a little chunkier.  But overall, good production and really love the artwork.

CRITIQUE OF CROWS
Crows is a simple tile-laying game that plays very much like other tile-laying games: place a tile and then put something on it. Only in this case, you aren't using meeples but instead shiny objects (which attract the crows).

The first thing that struck me about Crows is how different it looks from other games on my shelf. It definitely has a "less is more" aesthetic, which personally I enjoy. The components are all top-notch, and the box is among the sturdiest in my collection. The game is also language independent, which is excellent for a family game. I appreciate the obvious care that went into designing and producing the game.

I would classify Crows as a family game. If you hope to have a chance of winning it every turn will force you to calculate the best play, counting the movement of the crows along rows and columns. This constant need for calculation can lead to analysis paralysis among the players. Since adjusting the game for smaller groups is just a matter of removing tiles, it probably scales very well for two to four players (we played with three).

My complaint with tile-laying games is typically that they don't offer a lot of choices, and Crows suffers from this, as well. On every turn there is a lot of counting, "Hmm, I will get four points if I go here, and five points if I go there, but then you will get four..." That kind of dynamic exists in a lot of Euro games, but it dominates every turn in Crows.

The thing Crows does that is unique is to take the static nature of a tile-laying game and add some variety to it by having the victory points move around the board. And while it seems like this would help keep the game fresh, what it really does is eliminate a lot of opportunities you might have for long-term planning. Since every murder of crows removes two from the board, they tend not to accumulate, leading to scores of roughly the same number of points every turn.

In Crows, turn order is extremely important. While it's true that the people who go after you can sometimes interfere with your score, if they use the special tiles to do it they are also taking points away from themselves at the end. Again, this becomes a matter of "doing the math."

Overall, we found ourselves enjoying parts of the game, but feeling like it was too much a "one trick pony." Draw a tile; calculate; place your tile; calculate; place your shiny object. As our last game of Crows went on, we found ourselves relieved that we were getting to the end of the draw stack. My daughter didn't enjoy it at all, even though she loved the crow meeples, and it wasn't so much fun for my wife and I, either.

Crows would probably be a fine game for Reiner Knizia fans, and also for fans of Carcassonne. The graphic design is unique, and the components are excellent. I simply found it too "mathy" and repetitious to hold my interest.

RATING: 6
This is actually a pretty enjoyable, dressed up abstract!

LIKES:

* The little wooden crow-eeples are a nice touch, particularly when they flock together around shiny objects.
* The theme is actually quite fitting and humorous in some ways.
* The variance of the tiles make for a different game each time as the board will be different every game.  I also appreciate that there is a bonus associated with placing your shiny item on an empty tree tile and that there are a couple other types of tiles which change up play a bit (shiny trinket breaks ties & cemeteries score you double points).
* A murder of crows occurs if 6 or more crows end up on a spot meaning two fly off as a happy couple and the others are distributed in a spiral pattern so they unflock/uncluster to create more choice in placement of your shiny object.

DISLIKE:

* While the box says 4 can play, I think this is one of those games that play best with 2 or 3...like I feel so many tile placement games tend to do.

Players place tiles and then position their "shiny objects" to attract the most crows. After everyone has had a go, points are calculated each turn for the number of crows which are attracted (because attracting Crows is a good thing..?).
Crows move according to simple rules.
There is not much to do when it isn't your turn, and hopefully players move quickly. It is one of those games where if one player is less acute than the others, the person playing immediately after will be at a significant advantage.
It is OK, plays in about 40 minutes. The crow meeples are small and stand-up only with reluctance.

Wonderful new theme, one that is great for October game playing. I really enjoy the simple artwork of trees and crows. The box is really nice and sturdy. A nice game of trying to attract the most crows to your shiny stone. You can gain double points by attracting them to your stone located in a graveyard. Garbage is the only thing that will keep the crows away. A great medium light game that is nice for week night gaming. It is not a filler really...because of length of play...but it is a simple game to learn or teach.

I think this game over-complicates itself and offers fiddliness where it's completely unneeded.  Other than that it's not a bad game, but those qwirks still make the rating suffer.

Easy to learn.  

The theme is unique.

The special tiles really add to the tactical nature of the game.

[b]Weakness[/b]

A bit fiddly, the crows are bit difficult to pick up, but thematically they are fun and I wouldn't trade them for black cubes that are a little easier to move.

[b]Other Thoughts[/b]

During the first game it didn't really seem like you plan from turn to turn, but by the 2nd game I could already see how you have to plan a turn or two in advance.

Doesn't overstay its welcome. Even playing without the special chit powers is engaging. A little prone to AP, but enough going on to make it non-calcuable. Rotating turn order and awesome crow pieces help a lot in making this fun.

A fine tile placement game, sort of abstract and puzzle like, lacking strategic choices. When being taught the rules I thought it sounded neat, but in playing it was just too lucky. If you drew a tile with crows on it you got a bonus title worth at least 2 points, just for drawing it! If you drew a tile with just a crow-less tree, not only did you not get a bonus, but you also had less options to manipulate the board because your tile didn't add any crows. It just felt kind of lucky and very obvious.

This is a tough one for me to rate. I had trepidation as the box appeared at the game club - it didn't seem like a theme that would appeal to me and I had my doubts. What emerged was what is obviously a very clever game. I think it could appeal to families as well as deep strategic thinkers. It's not a game I would want to buy myself, nor especially chase after another play, but I might play again if the opportunity arises. There's a good blend of planning and luck. On balance then, not a game I like especially (personal taste) but it's clearly a good GAME, far better than I was expecting when the box emerged!

Add a tile to the grid, maybe add crows to it, then place your 'shiny thing' to attract crows. After all players have done this, we see which crows on the grid fly to which shiny things. Whoever collects most crows over the game wins. A few different tile types to introduce bonuses, blocks & increase your crow-attractiveness.

Although abstract, the theme is strong, and I enjoyed my single 2-player game. I wonder how much you can use this turn to create opportunities for next turn?

RATING: 6.5
Fun game with some interesting things going on. It is kind of like the reverse of "Hey! That's my fish!" in that you're trying to get things to cluster together instead of spreading apart. Definitely interesting, but it feels a bit too mathematical and abstract for my tastes. Not much of a fan of tile drawing games, since I enjoy having a "hand" of tiles. Either way, it was still fun and developed some interesting movement patterns with play. Surprised more people haven't heard of it or played it.

RATING: 6
A fine tile-laying game, but a bit too simple.  It feels like luck is the biggest factor here.  I just don't see a way to play well unless you get lucky.  

I like how the crows gather and then separate.  That's a great way to keep the crow piles from getting too large.

Received in the WBC math trade August 5th.

Given to my buddy as a gift.

A great way to bring Carcassonne players onto a new game. Easier scoring as there's no farm rules to explain. I swear, though, that changing the crows into bees, the shiny objects into hives and the trees with crows into fields with flowers would have make it an easier sell for non-gamers. The theme is just a bit gloomy for light players.

Love the production of this game (and the crow meeples). Is a bit fidgety, especially when you have to disperse the murder. My husband compared it to Fearsome Floors (I guess it is the whole 'line of sight' thing) but I would say I liked Crows a lot better. Not sure how much love it will get around here; might take it to a Meet-up and see how it is with more than 2p. Having said that, my first impression is that it seems to lack some depth, in what way it's hard to say but it just feels like it should have something more strategic to it for and abstract.

Excellent job by Valley Games, they've turned it around a bit after some troubles in the past. You get one action on your turn, place your marker on the board, hopefully in a spot where crows will be attracted. Simple rules, in that crows fly in a straight line to the closest object, however, clever placement by others can steal away crows that you thought were coming to you. Bonus tiles allow extra actions to really cause havoc. I liked how once you get a large collection of crows on one space, they disperse in a circular pattern, which seemed very thematic. Fun, simple game.

While I suppose this tile laying game would be considered an abstract, the mechanisms of the game work just as you'd expect they would, which makes it feel more thematic than most other abstracts. The game consists of a flock of crows, with the player's competing to attract the most birds to their tree by baiting them with shiny objects. Sure, it's a pretty dumb theme, but the crows behavior is both predictable and easy to manipulate which allows the players to focus on robbing each other of points.

The game is fun, but moving the crows around every time someone lays a tile does cause a fair amount of board maintenance.

My only question, is why isn't this an iOS/Android app? It seems absolutely made for it...

i am being very generous on this as we couldnt finish the game. Actuallt, the other players decided we had enough of a bad game and we stopped. I didnt find it THAT bad but honestelt it wasnt shining as a work of art. there's not much to decide, just try to make some calculations ... no strategy, just luck and some tactics...; i am not eager to try it again

I adore this game- it is beautiful in it's simplicity. I would have rated it higher, except as my fiance pointed out last night after annihilating me, it is too easy for one player to take advantage of and monopolize the "double-points" squares during a two person game and runaway with the game.

And, honestly, the crows are just cute as hell.

I really looked forward to the release of this great game and was one of the lucky ones to get my hands on a copy very early.

I think this game is lots of fun! It has relatively unique game mechanics and makes for a great abstract, light-strategy board game with an interesting theme.

The components are top notch and very visually appealing.  I especially like the tiny wooden crowples!

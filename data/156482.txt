It can be played solo!  I didn't back it during the kickstarter, which I mildly regret, but I'm still hoping to pick up a copy someday.

A great cooperative game that really adds a lot more replayability than some of the other ones out there. We saw a lot of people who were having fun at PAX East playing this and the booth was always packed. Looking forward to getting my own copy.

I have playtested this game a lot, and I'm still not bored with playing it. The scenarios change every game, the character combinations change every game, and the enemies and hazards in the deck change every game. Every playthrough is a challenge, and usually comes down to the last few tiles in the deck and barely any food left in base to feed your fellow survivors. Can't wait to get a copy of the final game so that I can introduce it to others!

I can not say enough great things about this game.  I am so looking forward to getting my copy from the Kickstarter program.   

I played this at Pax East this year and we had a ton of fun.  We sat down, the directions were easy to jump right in and even though we didn't get to finish the game (we had another event to get to) my whole group walked away feeling like this was a great game to invest in.  I would have bought it on the spot if I could have!!!!

I love the little things that have been thought about, the rule/action summery cards, the way you have to work together to get resources, explore, and survive.  

I HIGHLY recommend supporting the Kickstarter and getting a copy, you won't be disappointed.

I helped demo this game at Pax East 2014 and had a great time with every playthrough! I love how well balanced it is. It was awesome seeing the different strategies each group took as the game tried its best to destroy us. We won some, we lost some and it was different and exciting each time. I’m looking forward to owning a copy!

Fun premise, solid gameplay, fair+fun difficulty with tension, planning and teamwork.  Rulebook is a mess, and we found that we needed lots of houserules/interpretations to logic through what we (guessed) assumed the intent was.

RATING: N/A
The idea for this game is a gem.  Seriously expecting it to be one of my favorite games, especially because it's co-op! The creators of this game have been incredibly involved in the Kickstarter campaign, and have been both open to suggestions and willing to make changes, which shows how much they care about the project! It's obvious that many loving hours have been poured into its development, and I'm excited to experience it for the first time!

Bad title choice. 

Neat tile laying game. Base eating food adds an extra layer to how you lay out the tiles.

RATING: 10
Wow, what a great game. I even like that in the rule book it is stated how to fill the box :). The rule book is really build up clever and explains everything. The game itself is very hard. The first exploring mission I just managed but now on the map mission I failed 3 times already even that the games are always very different. If too many enemies occour at the beginning of the game its a bit mission impossible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
nice game. good narrative. more interactivity than expected with all those actions. good quality components. rated after 2 plays. bad point for now: there are out-of-your-control situations that could kill a survivor (as exploring a blaze when you are blocked by a downfall).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
This is an unheralded gem. It's a cooperative tile-laying game where you explore out from your base, filling in the post-apocalyptic nightmare world around you. The game is pretty simple at its core but the wide range of tiles and enemies add complexity and the occasional rule ambiguity due to overlapping interactions.

The game has a couple of primary elements that are pretty satisfying. Exploration (with wide variety), and resource management. You will need to manage your base's food supply which works as a timer in the game (sort of like Robinson Crusoe). This requires scrounging resources from tiles and making careful decisions about how you spend them.

There's also a bit of a tower defense feel as some enemies will make a b-line towards your safehouse and attempt to ravage it, dwindling that precious food.

Love the monster meeples and all the interesting shapes. It gives this game visual weight and impact that helps with evoke the setting.

The downsides to this game include the sheer randomness of the tile draw (leading to lopsided defeats occasionally), and the abstracted nature of play in general that can sometimes feel more puzzle-y than thematic.

I was one of the people who helped show this game off at PAX East 2014. I decided to help show off the game because I enjoy playing the game and I want others to have the same fun I have when I play it.

Great game- good mix of complexity and simple game mechanics.  Challenging enough to keep even veteran players engaged, and has a good replay value due to some of the randomness of the cards.

I did [b]not[/b] expect to like this game when I sat down to play it. And there are certainly elements of it which aren't my cup of tea. [i](Eg: more turns than I'd have liked were simply spent getting from place to place - and if you're injured, you get even fewer actions per turn.)[/i] But overall, it presented a much more interesting/engaging play experience than I'd anticipated. A few of the reasons:

 * The 'food clock' of keeping your base supplied. It's the primary driver of the game: you [i]must[/i] continue exploring even though you will find terrible things (and haven't even managed to deal with all the other terrible things you've found yet).

 * The different activity patterns and abilities of monsters / antagonists. Each really did need handling in a different way that altered how we played, and the board topology / resources we'd found affected our options in being able to do so.

 * Multiple uses for resources. Food gains you game-time - or extra actions. Scrap gains you barriers, or armor, or closes certain monster spawns. (And in our scenario, was needed for outposts.) Food + Scrap gives a trap. This creates interesting choices about how to use what you find. (Ammo + Medicine were single-purpose in the demo, but I'm told that some scenarios/characters have other uses for them.)

We won our game one turn before we would have lost, with half of us unconscious outside our base having barely held off an incursion of monsters after running completely out of ammunition. We had moments of triumph, of desperate hope, and of "oh crap, we're totally screwed". Not too shabby.

Played this at PAX East and was pleasantly surprised. After a day and a half of near non-stop board game playing I was feeling burnt out and almost didn't even want to play. But I sat down and had a blast with the other players. I am looking forward to playing with my own copy.

We tried it with 2 and while it was enjoyable, it took a long time. It would probably play faster with more people, although there would be more downtime between turns.

There is definitely a lot of replayability since there are different missions, each survivor has a different ability, you can lay out the tiles differently, and you can add tasks.

Interested to see if they will do an expansion someday.

The quickstart game seems to be well balanced. Will have to play some of the others to see if this continues to hold true.

I kickstarted this game and am always worried about games I don't play before I buy, but this one immediately became one of my favorites. The strategy is interesting, there are lots of trade-offs to consider on a players move. The co-op aspect is well done. There are a lot of different missions and different characters to play, and the creators added an order to the missions you can play through so it seems like one long story, which is great. 

Edit after owning for more than a year: Still one of our favorites. One great thing is you can set the difficulty level and then either spend a ton of time thinking about strategy or very little depending on your preference that night. The different missions and characters keep things fresh. Love the game and highly recommend it!

Received in trade, May 2017.

Initial impression (after just a few solitaire play-throughs - nothing with other people) is:  good but not great. 

Pros:
1.  Plays very well solitaire.
2.  It sets up quick and plays quick (total time = 1 hour).  This fits a great niche for me, with regards to solitaire play.  I have several other LONG games I like to play solitaire (Mage Knight, Eldritch Horror), but not too many short ones.
3.  Once you know the rules, the flow of the game is quite simple.
4.  Fair amount of replayability, with the number of missions, survivors, and random maps.  However, see #4 below.
5.  Tells a good story (especially tragedy), although it helps if you inject your imagination into it.  Last night, I had a epic encounter with the Behemoth, who wiped out half my team before the rest succumbed to starvation.  
6.  I'm OK with the tile art.  I like the wooden pieces.  It all has a classic feel to it, although this also means that a $60 price tag feels a bit off.

Cons:
1.  Rulebook definitely could have been organized better.  Quickstart should have been excised.  Some rules about combat here, some there.  Some rules about set-up here, some there.  Frustrating.
2.  Not a fan of the graphic design for rulebook and cards.  
3.  The nature of the random tile-draw when exploring your map will have a large effect on the difficulty and/or length of your scenario. 
4.  There might not be enough *meat* to this game to make it a fully satisfying strategic experience.  And, as a narrative experience, it's fairly sparse (compared to something like Eldritch Horror).
5.  You end up seeing most of what this game has to offer after 1-3 scenarios.  Sure, there's replayability in how the narrative for each adventure plays out, but the overall feel of the game won't change much.  You could obviously say the same for Pandemic and other cooperatives, but I think it hits this game harder because the tile-draws drive the action so much.  I think that if only a minority (less than 50%) of all possible tiles were included in each scenario, this game would have greater legs.  
6.  The MSRP is too high.  I just don't see this game being worth $60.  $30 definitely, and maybe even $40.
7.  This is a pretty ugly game, esp. the graphic design, and that definitely contributes to why I can't *really* get into it.

As a solo game, Unknown excels at sending you creeping into the shadows, battling horrors in the dark, and scrounging for handfuls of bullets and pills. It works less well with multiple players, unfortunately.

Unknown fits a very unique and appreciated niche in my collection by combining tile-laying exploration and an overall Euro aesthetic with the mission-oriented appeal of a dungeon crawler. Great components. Seems almost infinitely expandable. Very easy to play solo. A bit of a sleeper on Kickstarter that deserves more attention.

This game is a gem, a lot of fun. In two plays today, the games played very differently, and were both very tense.  There's a real sense that your decisions matter, and a dread when you pull an enemy tile at the wrong place/wrong time.  Definitely a keeper, my family really enjoyed it.

At BGG Con 2014 I stopped by the Eagle Games booth to get my bingo card stamped which led to meeting Peter Hawes again which led to getting my copy of Francis Drake signed which led to getting taught this newest of his games by the designer. It plays really quick -- we have finished multiple 4 and 5 player games in about an hour. It fits very nicely into the light to medium weight euro -- think Ticket to Ride meets area control -- that plays fast but still gives you meaningful decisions without burning your brain too much.

Fine game for up to 5 players. Easy rules and with few options on your turn the game keeps moving.  Lot's of take that to catch a leader.

I really love the layered area control scoring system. This game does depend a bit on chance in your card draw/display, but it also is quite strategic - requiring dedicated focus to the areas of interest to you that will either take points from an opponent or gain points for yourself. The system is very smooth and the production is delightful. Certainly a very good game!

My very particular wife really liked this game from the first time I made her play it. She has not declined to play it since. Another big board-gaming friend and his wife played it with us and also loved it. I have played it more than 10 times since buying it a few months ago and still find it very enjoyable.

I was amazed at this game. It was fun, plays in about an hour at max players of 5, has decisions, tension on other players quick turns and can be taught in minutes. The tabletalk about noble titles and roleplay is there too if you want to get into it and there is player interaction in the game but nothing superiorly mean. 

Highly highly recommended.

A solidly designed, "Ticket to Ride card mechanic" driven, "get area majorities on the board" game with a small amount of theme to hold things together, there is a decent amount of euro gamer appeal to this game.  

In particular, "race to complete" bonuses are all over the board at the beginning of each game, which feel fun to satisfy, and by the third round of the game, a certain amount of pleasure can be had by displacing other players using intrigue cards while also keeping an eye of the end game bonuses associated with the personality cards. 

On the other hand, as an experienced euro gamer, I am not sure how many games of this I would want to play, since it felt fairly standard and traditional in its gameplay.  We have done all this before, in perhaps, better games thematically and mechanically.  Nevertheless, this game can rightly be considered a worthy gateway game, perhaps functioning as a gateway intro to area majorities for all those young Ticket to Ride players.  This does feel like Ticket to Ride with area majorities.

A jumble of various area control opportunities with a "Ticket to Ride" card mechanic. Sounds lazy, works well.

Streamlined.  That's the word to describe this game.  Royals is an extremely streamlined, points-for-everything, area majority game that I learned from the designer. He's passionate about his work and very friendly and approachable which is awesome! There is one deck of cards with just four colors of card and that's it and another deck (intrigue) with two colors per card (of the 4 colors) and that's it. There are no numbers or anything else on the cards. The board is a map of Europe and you collect cards (basically Ticket to Ride style) and play them to add cubes to the map (place your royals on the map). Intrigue cards can be used to take over a spot on the map. First to certain spaces scores a bonus, first and second with influence throughout a country scores a bonus, three rounds of scoring for most and second-most influence in a country, and points for the player with the most royals of each type at game end. It's a huge mish-mash of points and creates for some interesting choices. This is just not my cup of tea... and I won convincingly in my one play (as I wasn't attacked as much as others). I'm impressed with how streamlined the design is, but maybe too streamlined for me for this type of game.

I need a couple more plays to see how i really feel about it, but it combines some nice elements from Ticket to Ride and El Grande. unfortunately the theme does not really shine during gameplay, but it is smooth mechanically.  i like the multiple aspects of area control between controling royal titles, country influence scoring, and control for influence of the cities.  Though it has a good deal of luck in what cards you draw, the multitude of choices leads to lots of late game decision-making, tension, and uncertainty with who really is going to win.

I very much disliked the hand limits, as it takes what I think should be legitimate strategies like color hoarding, and forces you to play crappy cards because you are not drawing what you need. 

Clearly, placing higher value guys is more advantageous but there is so much luck involved in who wins those races. Seeing other players get triples in the card draws is frustrating. I don't mind luck, but I found this to be annoying luck. 

Still, it is pretty quick and has interesting elements. Wouldn't mind playing again.

Loved this for playing with my kids (10 & 13 y.o.).  Good family game, good gateway area majority game.  We enjoyed the flow of the game where the goals in the beginning morph into somewhat different priorities in the middle followed by the "clean up" at the end.  The board looks dull as can be, but the game is quite fun - I had a similar reaction to Patrician which shares some similarities with this one.

A bit samey by the third time through the deck, or even the second - very little sense of progress. Applying a little math so you're seeing the same number of cards across all player counts would be helpful - clearly taking out 24 to go from 5p to 2p is not an equal ratio. Maybe they had to leave the deck bloat because of the board bloat... who knows... bottom line, not great with two, with more there are so many better area control games to choose from, it's hard to make a case for this one.

RATING: 5
A harmless card drafting Euro, where players scoop up cards, then play melds back down to place influence on generic, unexplained "Royals" in one of four countries (France, Britain, Spain, and an early form of Germany).  Pretty much anything you do has the opportunity to score some points, and there are plenty of points to be had.

I felt like I had seen this all before in the lovely super-filler, Kardinal und Koenig/Web of Power.  This seems to take that game and make it twice as long and twice as fiddly.  Pleasant, but too much to track, too long for the luck in the game, and if the superior Web of Power is on the shelf (which it is), why play this?

It is light game. Doesn't have complex rules and probably rewards the ability to adapt over gained experience. This makes it a great getaway game and still satisfying.

Another solid design by Peter Hawes.  Seamless mix of hand management & area control.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While the new graphic design is busier and jumbled, it is certainly more eye catching and inviting to new players.   I think the sacrifice was worth it.  It feels a touch more Game of Thronesian and a little less Louis XIV, which is probably the smarter play when aiming at the American market.  

I really enjoy how the scoring in the game shifts through the three ages.  First, you go after the office bonuses, then country bonuses, while simultaneously setting yourself for end of age points, and influence points on the character cards.  That shift in this game really lends itself to the carnage that follows in later ages.

With two players, the game feels long and repetetive by the end of the second age.   Three is fine, but it's 4-5 players where this game soars.  At the higher player counts, more thought needs to be given to where you're going to stake your claim on the board, and who you're going to oust out of power.  It's scrappier, more nail biting, and more enjoyable.

Note to self:  If someone could combine this game with the variable player powers of Small World, they'd create one heck of an awesome game.

In the same vein of TTR whereby you either take cards or spend cards to claim things except here you can kick people out of spaces. There are end-of-round points to fight over as well as passive bonuses that can be claimed by the first eligible player(s). It's quite straightforward and a solid, if uninspiring, design.

I can see the attraction of this game.  You can play it lightly, or you can think hard about it.  For me, the two options pull me in opposite directions and I'm not sure how to resolve it.

Royals is a very streamlined area majority game. Draft cards to seize positions of power all over Europe, expand your sphere of influence and oust opponents.

If you've never heard of something called "area control", this is it in a nutshell.  Easy enough to introduce new-ish players, with gameplay similar to something like Ticket to Ride, it nevertheless is packed with decisions, because in this game, you can never accomplish all your goals, and so some triage is always necessary.  The board art is beautiful, turns are fast, and you always need to watch what your opponents are doing.  This game ranks in my top 10 and I suspect it will stay there for awhile.

A decent-to-good card-based area control game with player interaction that isn't too mean-spirited or punishing. It doesn't have the depth of an El Grande but feels more fresh than something like Ticket to Ride. It's also easy to explain and get on and off the table in 45-60 minutes so it's a good game for light gamers or when you're pinched for time.

A very solid and nicely streamlined area control game. The early game encourages rapid placement to get bonus points, but the late game encourages you to delay so that you don't get bumped by the intrigue cards. Doesn't seem like it would be as enjoyable at lower player counts (of 2 or 3), but was very nice with 4. I imagine it would be even more backstabby with 5, and that might be ideal.

Played one 2-player game at SPIEL14/Essen. Pretty pure set-collection and area-control game. The theme is weak, but the mechanics very solid. It's easy to pick up, plays very smooth and fast. There's always player conflict when vying for the regions and nobles -- I wouldn't call it "interaction" though, as the game can be played very much in silence ;)

Very solid. Would play again.

A szerző korábbi játékaihoz hasonlóan ez is a középkori Európában játszódik. Spanyolország, Anglia, Franciaország és Németország van a térképen. Ezekben 3-6 város  van, egy városban pedig 1-2 nemes. A játék nagyon egyszerű. Felhúzunk 3 országkártyát, majd ha tudunk elfoglalunk egy városban egy nemest. Ehhez a nemes rangjától függően 2-8 azonos kártyára van szükségünk. Ha mi vagyunk az elsők akkor megkapjuk a városi bónuszt is. Ha egy adott ország minden városában jelen vagyunk, akkor megkapjuk az ország bónuszt is. Ha minden fajta nemesen vagyunk, akkor nemes bónuszt kapunk. Ha már foglalt egy város, akkor a szükséges számú kártyákon kívül még az adott országot jelölő intrika kártyára is szükség van. Ha elfogyott a húzópakli akkor értékeljük az országokat, kinek van benne nagyobb befolyásolása. Ezt összesen háromszor tesszük meg, majd véget ér a játék és még megnézzük ki milyen fajta nemesen van többségben, azért is pontozás jár. 

A játék számomra nagyon emlékeztet a Thurn und Taxis-ra illetve a Ticket to Ride-ra, de mindkettőnél sokkal gyengébb. Kifejezetten unalmasnak találtam. Semmi más dolgod nincs, mint kártyákat húzgálni és ha összegyűjt a megfelelő számú, akkor elfoglalni egy nemest. Ha meg már nincs üres nemes, akkor húzzál intrika kártyát és lökj ki valakit a pozícióból. 

Egyszerű játékmenet miatt inkább családi játéknak mondanám, bár annak is egysíkú. De az egymás kilökése meg nem teszi családivá a játékot. Gémereknek pedig túl unalmas a játék, gyakorlatilag mindenféle döntéshozatali lehetőség nélkül.

RATING: 9
I can see why this game is part of the Dice Tower essentials range. Really simple to learn with uncomplicated mechanisms, but it soon ramps up as the spaces are filled and people start ousting each other to gain control over a country. For me it never feels personal when your representatives have been killed. There are multiple ways to win this game, you just have the figure out how best to score points considering what everyone else is doing.

After one play I was pretty meh on this which was a shame as I was expecting a lot. After 2 I was really liking it! Want to play again and see how high I might rate it.
The simplicity of Ticket to Ride mixed with multiple consecutive area control battles that really make you think!

RATING: 8
This rating is slightly speculative, since I didn't actually finish the game I played. But I was really impressed with this as a family weight game. I could see this replacing something like Ticket to Ride in a lot of people's collections (personally I don't care for TtR at all). Turns go quickly and it's mostly about collecting sets of same colored cards to claim sections of the board. But where I think it wins out over Ticket to Ride is in how the scoring works. It always bothered me how in that game you might just only see a bunch of horizontal routes, and then you were at a huge advantage. Also it's generally clear what route you need to be claiming at any given time. The genius of Royals is in how many different scoring opportunities there are and how they either work together or against each other. There are points for being first into each city, points for being first into every city in each country, points for being first to influence every type of noble, end of round points for majorities in each country, and end of game points for majorities with each type of noble. And so all of these goals overlap and are at odds with each other at various times, so figuring out what is best for you at any given time is usually non-trivial. So it' a light, breezy game of collecting and playing like colored cards, but there's actually something to think about when it comes to where to play to and when to hold back to build up your hand.

Royals succeeds as an enjoyable introductory level area control game. It offers a wide range of viable strategies within an accessible ruleset. It can run a bit long because the final round generally involves a good deal of assassinations, which slows the game down quite a bit.

Royals 皇室 是個機制簡單直觀的遊戲，作者 Peter Hawes 的作品一向都具有很高的玩家互動，初跑這款遊戲時，乍玩的感覺像是TTR( Ticket to Ride )，一樣的抽牌打牌的概念，但 Royals 把遊戲的可變因子由目標牌轉為玩家間的制衡，光看規則或許會有不值一試的感覺，但老實說它是個有醍醐味的遊戲。

The rules are elegant and the game play is deep and rewarding. Turns are simple, you either draw cards or play cards. There is a hand limit so you can't wait too long before playing, not to mention the bonuses for being the first to claim a town which strongly incentivize early play. Once the battles for town spots simmer down you find yourself engrossed in battles to control entire countries, and influence at least one of each of the types of Nobel. 

You must carefully watch what your opponents are doing, and attempt to plan accordingly. Your ability to plan is heavily influenced by which cards you are able to draft. So building a plan with flexibility is key.

An excellent medium-light game which should appeal to a lot of gamers.

Ticket to Ride meets stabby noble world. Grab cards TTR style and then use them to gain favor with nobles. Exhaust the draw deck 3 times, with intermediate scoring in the middle, and then score for the final.

wasn't on the list but when I heard the designer talk about it I wanted it.

Area majority game that has sacrificed its theme for a short playing time.

I found that the deck of cards is too small and the uneven amount of rounds will favour the start player.

In a game with equally skilled opponents the start player has a big advantage over the last player. 

This can somehow be dealt with because you get to counter the moves but if I could pick i would allways go first.

Furthermore you are forced to go for short term gains because of the card availibility and the handlimit.

This is why I probably want to play this again with non gamers . 
If you are a gamer. There is something there besides the beautiful map. The sacrifice of cutting down the playtime also has one big benefit. It doesn't overstay it's welcome.
I have seen people getting bored by playing a game.
This isn't great but I think this won't happen here.

And In the end you have close straightforward area majority game.

I would have been proud on the art and the decision to fit it into an hour.
I wouldn't be as happy as the designer however.
I think I would have cut one area and mixed the intrigue cards a little instead of all doubles also using single ones.
Probably gave each player  &a single intriguecard as well on the start of the game.

It's good but not royal.

To the guy comparing it to Ticket to Ride ??? You can have a rather big hand of cards. and you have to get the right colours. But that's about it.

In Royals, players take on the roles of the great noble houses of the 17th century, fighting for supremacy in Europe at that time. With the help of the right country cards, they occupy influential positions and obtain bonuses for this in the form of victory points. The higher the rank of the title associated with the position, the more country cards required. Already-occupied positions can be contested by playing intrigue cards.

RATING: 6.8
It's supposedly a more streamlined, shorter, better and better-looking Heads of State update (I did not play that one). A web of scoring aims (mostly area majority or a Thurn und Taxis-like race to reach certain aims first), nothing special or new, but the resulting game is a playable, rather well-developed and somewhat enjoyable JASE.

RATING: 5
Sort of abstract game of multiple area/majority control. What theme there is is very difficult to get excited about. It's not a bad game, though it plays pretty long for what's there. Can be surprisingly vicious. The thing that struck me the most was that I came in a very close second and didn't feel like that was earned at all, having made only two really good plays in the entire game.

Disclaimer: Area majority is one of my least favorite mechanics. You end up depending on other people to find out if your actions bear any fruit.

Royals is a pure area-majority game. It has a Ticket to Ride-like mechanic to get majorities in the map and the type of nobles. I appreciate it that it's a fast-playing game that doesn't overstay it's welcome.

My first play of it I was pleasantly surprised and I rather enjoyed it. The play felt light and the competition not super fierce. My second play was the opposite: a total blood bath with everybody getting in everybody else's way. It confirmed everything I don't like about area majorities.

Just a game that outstays its welcome, at least with 5 players. There's not many decisions that matter as you can't plan ahead in a meaningful way. There's no reason to play this game, if there is El Grande or Ticket To Ride in a radius of 500 km.

My plays have been enjoyable, but I'm afraid the drab, busy looking board will just make this too hard to get to the table.

Played Ethnos recently and they are somewhat similar.  Ethnos is the far better game for me, by a landslide.

[b]Royals[/b] was received in a math trade (1/5/16).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I finally ended up getting a copy in part because I thought it'd be a game my wife would enjoy and I've also become a fan of Peter Hawe's designs. I don't introduce many new games to my wife because she doesn't enjoy hates learning new games. Thankfully it has been a hit not only with her, but also both of my older kids (10 and 13).

After only one play last year I can confirm my thoughts that this is a great introductory area control game that is easy to teach to new players. Royals plays well with all player counts, 2 to 5, in fact this is the first area control I'd recommend for two players. The game has a different flow when playing with two, but by the end of the game it is no less cut throat as you battle over control of countries. 

While my favorite are control games are still El Grande and Triassic Terror, Royals has the advantage of faster play time, simple to teach and plays great with two. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Royals, or Ticket to Ride meets area control. I honestly got the same feeling playing this as I do in TTR with one important exception. First the similarities, in both cards you are collecting cards in order to play sets of colors to take control of spaces on the board. In TTR you are trying to complete routes, in Royals you are competing for control of countries and each type aristocrat in the game. 

The biggest difference in the games is that in TTR you can block people permanently (unless you're playing with stations), whereas in Royals there is a second card type you can draw called an intrigue card. You can play an intrigue card with the required number of colored cards to kick someone out of a space on the board. Late game this becomes extremely important as the board fills up with cubes.

I mention the connection to TTR because I think Royals is very close to being a gateway game or at most a very small step up in complexity. I enjoyed my play of this game, it is a very clean design without any unnecessary rules clutter. The game play is quite straightforward, but the decisions you have to make are quite deep. You really have to pay attention to your opponents and what they are doing. 

I would consider this the gateway game into the genre of area control. It is as interactive as El Grande (my personal favorite), but easier to get into.[/i]

I'm so happy when all the excitement and hype of a game actually pay off. I was intrigued when the original edition came out a couple years ago (because I love Euros about aristocracy) and was very excited to see an English version announced last year. After finally getting my own copy, The Royals may be on a list of my favorite games. I know it's only after one play, but the decisions and turns are fast, but the strategy runs deep which is my favorite combination. I read a review that called this game "Ticket to Ride with a twist," which I think means card drafting with area majority added in to the victory point mix. The Royals is a step above the entryway games like Ticket to Ride or your basic Euro which makes it on the list to show my family if they show an interest in gaming. I love the artwork and the quality of the components and am really excited to hear about an expansion. Easy to teach and easy to play, very fun game!

It's a solid mid-weight Euro. The card drafting to place your meeples on the board is straight Web Of Power. You want to get your meeples out asap to begin with to collect bonus chits for being the first to be in each area, or the first to complete each area - straight from Thurn und Taxis. Once they're gone, it's a matter of accumulating cards to your hand limit and playing them all out just before the round ends to usurp positions on the board to gain first/second in the various area majority bonuses. With competent players, the scores should be bunched, and we found this late-game usurping to be king-makery. Also, the AP at the end to eke out your best final points is too much for what's otherwise a light mechanic (ie the card draw dependency) - in effect we just laid out all the cards and worked out the best options for each player to choose between. I also wasn't a fan of having to wait for each player to decide (after each card draw) whether they were playing to the table or not ("done"), much preferring end-turn card draw to avoid mid-turn analysis requirements, and allow the card draw to signify end of turn, like most games do. So it doesn't quite hit the mark for a family game, and it has some issues for gamers. Otherwise, borrowing so heavily from other solid games as it does means it in turn is quite solid. It does work, providing a vehicle for decent engagement. But unashamedly it has two feet clamped in the themeless, soulless Euro camp.

Royals is a re-imagining of the designer's earlier game, Heads of State, and I think it is an improvement.  Players play draft and play sets of country cards to claim various noble spots on the board--the more cards the noble costs, the more influence he has in each of the game's three scoring rounds.  Players also can claim bonuses for being the first player in each city, the first or second to have all the cities in a country, and the first, second, or third to have each of the types of nobles.  At the end of each third of the game (when the deck runs out), each country scores for its influence, with the first and second place players getting points.  Once all the noble spots start filling up, players can draw assassination cards instead of country cards, and use them to kill nobles and take their place.  The game is pretty simple, and does instill an urgency in the players because of all the get-there-first points.  The take-that didn't seem too out of place, as it only affects the end-of-round scoring.  However, the game is still pretty dry, and doesn't really feature anything new or exciting.

Well, 1 thing is for sure: Peter Hawes likes majorities :-) 

As a game itself I like this (as I like majorities as a game mechanism). My only 'complaint' about this game is that it feels like Triassic Terror revisited and rethemed. 

If you already own that one, then it doens't feel like you also need to own this. but if you don't own Triassic Terror yet and like majorities, this (cheaper) game is a good one to have in your collection.

Nice game, well balanced and many ways to score points. Playstyle reminds of Ticket to ride. I think it is nice casual game to play and I had fun playing it the first time. I don´t think it will satisfy the hardcore gamer though. If all players are observant and keep track of what happens in the game, the other players would team up against anyone who starts to get ahead from the rest.

Peter Hawes seems to be a very nice guy though, I almost bought the game because of him :) Think it would be nice to play the game with my family, but maybe not with my board game friends. 

Just played once at Essen 2014, a four player game. Maybe more games would change my opinion.

RATING: 8
This is an interesting game that uses set collection as a primary mechanism for essentially combining area majority scoring elements with point salad style 'firsties' points. The general idea is that you have a board of countries. Each country has a few spots you can place cubes. Cubes get placed by discarding a set of cards of the target country equal to what's printed in the spot. There are bonus points for the first player to take each spot, bonus points for being the first to have taken every spot in a country, and bonus points for being the first to have taken a spot of every cost level. Then, in addition to that, you can bump players out of spots and take them for yourself by playing the right card from a different deck along with paying the cost of the spot yourself. There's absolutely flip luck in this game, but it's mitigated by the rule that you can discard three of any to count for what you want. The game plays quickly and stays engaging for the entire experience.

Pretty interesting area control/majority game (it's both), it reminded me a lot of China, but where China's turns feel very quick and dynamic, this felt very cold and calculating. Don't get me wrong, this game plays in about an hour, just your moves here are more long term and sweeping than in China. I thought it took too many cards to do things and some turns featured way too much calculation, but overall it was an interesting game.

Fixes all of the worst parts of the previous try, Heads of State, and leaves a dull systematic rummy game.

I guess if you really wanted to have someone mix Ticket to Ride and Web of Power together look no further. It is fully functional, but nothing more. Really predictable, draw cards, hope for matching ones, drop cubes. The second half is made different by adding the friction of having to have special cards to knock you out of play. Does that make it more fun? I couldn't say, but at lease it isn't the exact same thing over and over again. Knowing that, there are zero surprises in the gameplay.

RATING: 7
This is a set collection and area/majority control game.  In this game players each take turns drawing cards from one of two decks.  One deck is used to "pay" influence in one of four different countries to take control of a city and an official in that city.  The other is used to wrest control from other players who have already claimed that location.  You can also draw from face-up cards or a face-down deck in Ticket to Ride fashion.

There are a lot of different areas where control scores you points.  You score points for being the first to take control in particular cities as well as first to take control of all cities in a country.  There is also end of age scoring giving points to whoever has the most influence in a given country and end of game scoring giving points to whoever has the most influence over specific officials across all countries.

Everything about this game is well designed to make it accessible and easy to absorb and understand.  If you don't have the cards you need and can't seem to draw them, fret not, because you can use 3 other cards as a wild.  Are you like me and every time you play Ticket to Ride you need to recount all the points at the end of the game because you constantly forget to give them out?  Well here all points you collect are printed on little chits so you can just add them all together at the end of the game.

The artwork is very minimal but I do like how all the information is portrayed on the board without looking crowded and cluttered.  The aforementioned chits are a great way of keeping score (although they are a little bit fiddly to put out at game start) and it comes with a custom insert to store everything properly.

This is a great lighter weight game with a decent amount of strategy and decisions to be made.

Run of the mill layered majority game.
Really nice streamlined card play where you can moderately plan your moves. On the opposite, it's really hard to keep up with player's scoring over 3 rounds.

I'm rating according to BGG guideline so it's not a bad game, just one I don't really want to play again. Everything is functional, it's just no particularly inspiring. If you want to introduce people to the majority genre, else play El Grande.

RATING: 5
Multi-majority game where players claim locations on a board with sets of cards (e.g., 8 "France" cards to take the king spot in France; 6 "Germany" cards to take the cardinal spot in Germany). There are points for first in to each location, first to be at all locations in a country, end-game scoring for taking several of the same role (e.g., multiple princesses in different countries) and majority scoring at the end of each of the three rounds within each country. Phew.

It's a similar weight to Ticket to Ride and clearly aimed at that family market, so I was never likely to be interested. While it works mechanically, it's pretty lifeless; early in the game there is likely to be a land-grab for the first-in tiles, which sets the stage for 2 rounds of slowly building or chipping away at majorities. An annoying mix of weak, indirect interaction, luck (need the right cards, especially to assassinate!) and abstract maths (it's clearly more about the numbers than the theme).

Our group was taught by Peter, the designer, at BGG Con. I must say, Peter is very enthusiastic about this one, as he should be. This is a well designed game. Simple to learn, but there is strategy. Timing is key. Similar to Ticket to Ride as far as gather cards each turn and placing subjects on the board. When, Where, and Why. But this is not Ticket to Ride. Would work great as a gateway game, but gamers will like this one too. Components and art work are great.I enjoy both. Good for gamers who don't have 2+ hours to play. I hope it comes soon, so I can purchase.

Rating comes from great first impression of Peter the designer, components were very nice, great in game experience, which left me with a desire for more. 

con:  I  did not  like the pressure  to play fast.

Gateway set collection / area majority game.  Simple rules: Pick 3 cards, play sets matching one of the four colors, repeat. Sets are valued according to place on the board, plus any achievements on that turn.  

I only played the 2016 edition, which adds superfluous graphics to the board. For ex, influence tokens now lead one to obscure the identity of each Royal, all because of 'feature creep'. This doesn't appear to be the case in the previous iteration.

First play impressions: Really good game. It combines race elements (first person to meet certain criteria gets more points) with layers of area majority elements. And it does it all with a really simple Ticket to Ride-style card system. You just collect cards of different colors then play those cards to put cubes on various spots.

There's a variant in rulebook where you have four face-up cards instead of three, which I highly recommend. This helps a little with the luck of the draw.

My only question is how it will compare to China/Han after several plays. Both games use a similar system of card management and area control, but I need more plays of both games to see if one can replace the other. China/Han has some more interesting scoring mechanics and plays faster, but Royals has the race element and a nicer presentation.

Definitely an improvement on Heads of State, but I still didn't enjoy it all that much. The first part of the game isn't bad, although it seems imperative to grab cheap stuff early - trying to grab more expensive stuff not quite as early doesn't seem to work, which reduces the strategy space. However, once everything is occupied the game turns into a festival of churning, which is not something I care for.

It doesn't help the game that it is reminiscent of Web of Power/China/Han in a number of ways and that the other game is better in any of its incarnations. That may be an unfair way to judge a game, but it's more or less inevitable.

This is like Web of Power/China, with some key differences:

- The values of each area are fixed, rather than determined by player actions. 
- There are only four card colours as opposed to five, but the ability to change colour is much more restrictive.
- The game deck is used three times instead of two

The result is, to me, far less interesting than in WoP/China. Royals presents players with a mix of short, medium and long-term scoring goals (think Thurn and Taxis), but these only serve to obfuscate the valuation process; they add cognitive load without making the decisions more meaningful or interesting. Both games are extremely tactical, but the reduced flexibility of card-play in Royals means that the construction of the deck plays a huge role in the dynamics of the game. Maybe the added restrictions and point considerations are necessary to maintain interest in a game of this length, but I found that the game ran out of steam sometime after the second scoring round.

Cleverly simple.  I love games that are easy to learn but offer a lot of different strategic options.  This is an area majority game that you could get your mother to play.  Your turn could be as simple as drawing three cards, me hitch is where the Ticket to Ride nods come from.  You're collecting card colors to purchase spots before others.  Several different areas you're trying to get majority in at once, all ties together we'll.  I'm a theme guy, and the game isn't much to look at, the idea is all abstracted, but the gameplay is there.

Area control game with Ticket to Ride style mechanics. Race for victory points, get points in multiple ways.

Plays very fast. I have only played it with 4; but would like to play it with full compliment. I think we clocked it to about 1.2 hours.

Downsides, colours of cubes aren't good in poor light, especially the black one.  Still not sure why there isn't enough cubes per player, and every time I pack the game away I need to sort the cards out again because the next time I play it I may need to remove a certain number of cards depending on player count.

I would never play this with less than 4.

Good game.  Not sure of its depth or replayability as its just a race for victory points with no other real main strategies. Not a hard game, in same weight class as Ticket to ride, although that game is much better for new players as an introduction to Euro style games.

RATING: 5
Start with Ticket to Ride. Get rid of the position-exclusive map, and replace that with several layers of majority control. Add the ability to (expensively) knock each other out of seats that determine that control, and make the game escalate to a point that in the last half of the game, [b]every[/b] "tracklaying" play requires kicking someone out, and that's Royals.  The king-of-the-hill ramming each other out of royal offices feels thematically spot on — well done there — but I do not enjoy this. When the game reaches the point of being a shoving match, trying to time it just right for the end of the era and/or game, distaste starts to form in my mouth.

For some, this will be exactly how they'd like to see Ticket to Ride mutated, but for me, who prefers every "more advanced" rule of TtR over the original, I strongly prefer the original TtR over this evolution of it.

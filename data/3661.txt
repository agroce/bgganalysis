RATING: 6
Another game I'd love to play more; I've only played the campaign to its conclusion once, I think.

(1/3/15) Just played a game of this for the first time in years. Nostalgia had blinded me to the faults of the game, which are the weaknesses of all 70s hex-and-counter wargames - fiddly little counters, CRTs, etc. with the added pain of poorly-written and badly laid out rules.

The point-to-point movement of jump tech, production schedule and the Imperial intervention still add a great deal of flavour, though.

Downgraded to a 6. Sold, Feb 2016.

Nostalgia may taint my rating here somewhat, but I always had a lot of fun with this one. The different capabilities of the two fleets, the totally different production models for each side, the clever and interesting combat resolution system that adds both drama and makes for interesting decisions about how much of what kinds of ships to produce ... it's all quite clever, and individual wars can be played pretty quickly, and "campaign games" with cycles of war and peace linked together are easy to play over multiple sessions. It's not perfect, there are some balance issues, and it can be a little lucky ... but I always found it a lot of fun and very evocative, the best game of this type that I've played. Bonus points if you're a Traveller fan and reasonably conversant with the history of that universe.

One of the better space empire boardgames. I have the GDW version with puzzle-locking board. Combat is handled simply and elegantly. Graphics are servicable if not spectacular. Rules are easy. The neatest part is the continuing epic scale of the game, where the players fight multiple wars over the course of the game, with the results of the last war having a carryover effect to the start of the next one. Relatively short play time is also a plus (1-2 hours for a given war).

After one play it's nice. It's got production, maintenance and even a political element. The map is small, the movement simple, and the combat system is straightforward.

Unfortunately, the rules are extremely murky in places. Nobody seems to entirely understand how transports and invasions actually work. Do the transports land on the planet or not? If so, how or when do they leave? The rules in general are just not well organized and could really use a makeover.

Another original game from my earlier wargaming time (i.e., pre-teen). When I discovered it while cleaning out my stuff from my dad's home, I brought it home with me and tried playing it once with my son.

RATING: 8
Thirty years old and still better than every space empire game on the market today.  
 
This is an overlooked classic, a masterpiece to while away a rainy day with a friend. And what better way to spend quality time than to vaporize them and invade their homeworlds? There are two factors that really really make this game stand out: its focused design and its campaign system.  The design does not try to throw in every possible thing a space game could have, and it is better for this. The keys are the fleets and the economic differences. [A House Divided benefitted from a similar design choice, to focus on terrain and unit types and ignore generals, events, and other fiddly details]. By streamlining jump range, ship damage, politics, industrial production, and other factors you get to worry over the important stuff. This makes the game faster and more enjoyable all around.
  
The other triumph is the amazing built-in campaign system. A single war lasts a few hours of playing, and you are encouraged to note the final state of the board. From this, you figure out the duration of peace and what ships are decommissioned, then use that as setup for the next war. Genius.

The imperials seem to hold a lot of the aces in this. But it only takes one military disaster and the whole game can flip around. Very tense simple space hex and counter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game and system. Have only played the first GDW edition. 

Unfortunately there's one big weakness in the campaign system that allows the Imperials to almost always win in the end. The terrans have to be extremely (almost suicidal) aggressive to have a chance in the campaign. Still, despite this flaw I love playing it when I get a chance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Love the ship depictions on the counters.  Is it me or does the Terran destroyer look like a Fleur-de-lis?  Anyways, nostalgia is strong with this one.  Perhaps it is clouding my judgement and that wouldn't be the first time!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
The uniquely interesting feature of this game is the fact that it simulates multiple conflicts over time.  Empires lose the will to fight and sue for peace, and  irresistible dreadnoughts rust into useless hulks during intervals of disuse.  The Imperial player represents a sector governor subject to the whims of the Emperor, and must ask permission to construct the largest ships.  Thus, though the Empire has the might to defeat the Earth player, its local representative is handicapped by the Emperor's wariness; his requests for men and materiel must be balanced against competing demands from the rest of the Empire.  Good graphics quality, very evocative of the theme.  Fairly clear rules, easy to learn.  Recommended.

RATING: 9
The campaign can be long, but it's best to break it up over several sessions. The system is just so [i]neat,[/i] though!

RATING: 8
A bit torn about this game. I thought it has real potential (and back in 1977, it must have really rocked!) Very clever design with the layout of the map situated with strategic chokepoints and the asymmetric opposing forces. And the idea of linking individual games into a "campaign" is a very nice effort to create the RPG-feel, and maximising the Traveller setting.  

But the rules are decidedly dated, with a couple of loopholes that could make things gamey. Still, nothing that can't be fixed. 

OK, I'm still torn but simple mechanics combined with evocative theme equals a great sci-fi game.

RATING: 6
An excellent interstellar wargame with a up and coming Terran Empire vs. a long established and decadent Imperium.

Done in the 70s, I think that this game is ahead of its time and all of this done in a simple way.

The game is won if either side totally controls the board(controlling all systems) or the Imperial player gets enough glory points.

PROS:

1. Nice blend of galactic politics, economics and warfare done in a very simple way.

2. Simple to learn that even a non wargamer can get into it(note to those Traveller RPG fans, this game while not naming names could be understood as the Terran Federation(Early Solomani vs. the decadent Vilani Empire) in the first interstellar war.

3. Well balanced with initially strong Imperial forces balanced by good terran economic output.

4. The system is so flexible that house rules can easilly be blended in with the game.


CONS:

1. People can get turned off by the poor looking components especially the really bad box cover(I'm referring to the first edition) but they are functional. Some counter errata is needed though.

2. While the game is simple reading the rules is not and some errata and editing is needed to make the rules more user friendly and clearer(or use your common sense).

3. While I like the combat system, this can get boring with constant dice rolls(moderate wristlage).

I have always enjoyed the grand strategic scale of this game, war after war after war. It's a bit pre-determined, in that Terra gets pummeled, but never destroyed. and eventually takes over the board. But it adds so very much to Traveller feel and play. It, Dark Nebula, and Fifth Frontier War add huge strategic level play to GDW's Third Imperium in Traveller. Gerry

Awesome in my youth and still pretty singular, though a bit slower than I like. It is from an optimistic era where designers weren't creating SF games so much as they aimed to create SF in game form.

A generally good strategy game out in the galaxy on the classic human vs. aliens....no, I mean on paper.  There is two version on this game.  The first one came with a mounted map from Conflict and the second one from GDW was replaced with a paper map. Avalanche Press took it and released the third edition with revised rules and much upgraded quality components. Some issues with the balance properties though, e.g. the sides involved not having the same strength.  Otherwise, the game is ok.

nov '17:  Wow, I don't know how long I've had this, but it has been a long, long time.  Finally played a few turns.  Quite entertaining, actually, but it does move a bit slowly.  My opponent did a suicide run and was pretty defenseless and I was moving in under orders from the Emperor.  The game came in a box of Starfall by surprise, but all the counters were mixed together so my first job was to get them separated.  The rules pretty straightforward but with nice additions like random event table, appeals to the emporer, and other little details.  Not sure how much it will be played, but willing if requested.

A surprisingly good space game for those that like something with a strategic element. As a teenager last Millennium I played an extended campaign of this over the summer holidays with a friend and we both had a wonderful time. Each war can be played in a few hours, with a set of rules for how to deal with forces between each campaign. The unpredictable construction limits on the Imperial player add a nice degree of uncertainty to each individual war.

An ingenious, amusing and very atmospheric SF game, in which Terran space fleets clash with the outposts of Empire, and which I played a lot of back in the 1970s.

One of the first board games that I ever purchased for myself along with Ogre, Barbarian Prince and Asteroid. I really enjoyed figuring this game out, and even as a 13yo I could appreciate its cool depth. I'd never encountered anything like it before...an entire war across planets. However looking back it was too much for me. After two or three plays, it was put aside for DnD.

RATING: 8
Imperium is a great space opera game. While the rules have some particular exceptions and cases you'd need to dig out of them as written, as a whole Imperium is a fun two player experience. I've also enjoyed the game playing solo against myself and examining different tactics. 

The hardest mechanic in the game would probably be cross-referencing tables. Player calculation is limited to spending production points during the build phase and comparing ground troops against one another to find your place on a roll-able chart.

The game features semi-tactical combat, variable player powers, an economic engine, random events (for the empire), ground-and-space combat distinction, variable game scaling, and notably a campaign system which allows you to end your scenario, perform a process, then pick up the next game until one player's planets have been eliminated or captured.

Though the game is somewhat dated due to the use of charts and tables for several important functions (including combat), it's one of the most elegant two player games I've seen and enjoy playing it.

I even built my own copy! Several of my source files are already in the gallery and files section. Bought the PDF.

That rating may be tinged ever so slightly with nostalgia, but I'm seriously considering picking this up again. Dated for sure, but a solid design nonetheless. I really love the narrative that played out in my head as I played. I also greatly enjoyed sending my hordes of missile boats against those haughty Imperials.

Playing a "game" of Imperium is a lot like playing one hole of golf... or one inning of baseball... it's definitely designed to be part of a much greater event: in this case, the continuing campaign. When playing the campaign, the ending of one game defines the start of the next. I enjoyed Imperium a lot, but I do have one reservation: the campaign struck me as being endless. Neither side has a decisive advantage, and there are limited choke-points between the two adversaries on the map which are the only paths that can be taken to attack the enemy. It seems as if you are constantly capturing, losing, and recapturing the same few star systems over and over. I never figured how either side could ever hope to win the campaign, assuming that both players are evenly matched in skill. Eventually I got tired of it and moved on to other games... but it was sure fun while it lasted.

I had a friend back in high school who was really into this game and we would play all the time. I like the delayed production system and the simple but workable tactical combat system (battles are resolved off board on the table top). You could push your forces along the hyperspace map or take your chances with the long haul across normal space. Would like to get a hold of a copy and play some more.

Ok, I've decided this will never hit my table again. Will trade for another game. Imperium survived the purge of 2004. A Navy in space type game with a land game feel because units travel by jump routes that encourage movement through certain systems like roads.  The economic and war/peace cycle mechanics drags the game down for me. I really liked the Combay system and all the ship types though.

RATING: 6
Hard to believe this goes back all the way to 1977.  Still gets right what so many other games get wrong, but the edges have gotten really rough over the ages.  A more interactive move system, better balanced ships/costs, etc. would be welcome but are not really necessary to enjoy this classic.  If you feel the need to get the 3rd edition though, be prepared to throw out half the rules and frankenstein some of the 2nd edition rules back in.  Some ideas are great, others terrible, and it's up to you to sort them out.

Imperium is one of the best sci fi games ever. One of its cleverest features is an inter-war procedure that generates the next session's starting position, which will take the results of previous games into account. This forces players to engage in long term strategic thinking, beyond the current war. That's a rare thing, and worth its weight in gold.

Even if you just play an isolated game as a one off, you'll find a fascinating system full of rich decision points. If you're into science fiction and wargames, this game is a must.

Important note: stay away from the Avalanche games remake. You want the GDW version, even if it's 1st edition (the changes for 2nd edition were minor).

Great old space-empire strategy campaign game.  Didn't actually finish all the games to the bitter end; we usually went with who was ahead the most when we ran out of time and steam, but there were a few continuing campaigns in there.  Very good game with a LOT of chrome without a lot of difficulty.  Pulled this out several times in recent years to play an ongoing campaign.  Still great.

One of the first sci-fi wargames I ever had, I keep coming back to this, setting it up, playing a few solo turns and discovering new twists within the campaigns, as you fight from war to war. I can immerse myself in this for hours, as I did when I was a lad. Forward defence positions on Procyon or Barnard's Star, sending out mil-expeditions towards Midway and beyond, and defending the gates of Nusku and Dushaam. Where did I last leave that Tanker?

An extremely complex game with more phases and subphases of player turns than Magic: the Gathering. I don't know how to rate this game, as I've never played a full game of it; however it probably says something that my attempts to play have always ended in boredom combined with frustration over figuring out the rules. The rules book claims it can take several days to play a game.

Had the original, until it got rained on. Really good. Got the Avalanche version, thinking it would be the same (but prettier). I don't even get what's going on! Fortunately, I have a copy of the original rules that I can use.

UPDATE: After rereading the rules, paying attention to what I'm reading, and not expecting it to be the same game, I finally understand the game. Now that BGG has a seperate area for it, see my comments there.

Decent little simple space game. Loved the concept of periods of peace in which the loser got to rebuild more than the victor did before the next war. This was a rare concept in games. Still remember playing this one late into a hot summer night in the back of a Burger King in Norfolk, Virginia. There are probably much better games available today, but this GDW game was good fun.

It was great back in college. But looking back through it now, the rules are poorly written and lead to far too many arguments. It's a great theme or setting for a game that hasn't been re-hashed in quite the same manner... but that can't save the cloodgy mechanics.

RATING: 7
Not a game of blazing action and daring raids, but one of chess-like maneuver, economics and nerves. A major fleet engagement will eventually develop, and when it does it will be an epic battle. The tactical considerations of the game are pretty unforgiving - until an economic base on both sides has been well established fleet composition will be all about missile factors. Fail to incorporate this into your build strategy and you will lose. Split your fleet without sufficient superiority in missile factors and you will lose. Build beam ships early and you will lose. Fleets should be kept concentrated, with single-ship blockers on choke-points. A Monitor (or two), with a small group of screening ships is often necessary to hold an important world that cannot be covered by the main fleet. Don't split your fleet in such a way that the enemy can concentrate his own fleet on just a portion of yours unless in doing so he would have to give up something very valuable.

Both sides have to be extremely cautious in the beginning, with the burden of attack falling on the Imperium. The Terrans have the edge economically but the Imperium can occasionally get aggressive with a mandated offensive or an RU grant. The Imperial's job is to limit Terran growth as much as possible and look for an opportunity to either interdict Alpha Centauri or destroy a portion of the opposing fleet. The Terrans need to grow steadily with outposts and amass a large fleet of scouts and missile-boats. Along with outposts, troops, transports and the occasional monitor, the Terran player should not build anything else for the first couple of wars, at least. If an opportunity opens up to invade Procyon, take it. If an opportunity opens up to place an outpost in a primary system, take it.

If both players play very carefully the situation will develop to the point where large capital ships and beam factors come into play. In a very large fleet engagement, and there should not normally be any other kind aside from a monitor-assault with a bombarment/invasion fleet, heavy beam factors will come into play against ships with high screen factors. Beams are for the big-boys.

If either player stumbles along the way, it can easily spell his doom over the next three or four wars. In that the game seems fragile.

Another game from my youth that will remain in my collection forever. I played this with a friend in high school but mostly I played solo variants. I can see how newer games are better in many ways, such as production, components, etc., but deep down this has a soft spot. 

I've not played it in years for fear of ruining my memories.

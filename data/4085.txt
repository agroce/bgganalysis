The bloody advance of the german Army Group North to take Leningrad during Barbarossa.
A classic design and a very entertaining wargame.
A think the last version of DG (2013) is the best and give good chances to the german.
Very nice boxed edition. The first impression of counters can be weak but with several gameplays they grow.

One of the few wargames that I continue to get out of the cupboard and play. As a solo player the unknown soviets provide a new challenge each time. Small map and limited number of counters are great for speedy set-up and a quick game, (before my cats engage in total war). Always seems to produce a tense finish at the gates of Leningrad. Highly recommended as a game to introduce new players to the basics of wargaming - let them play with the Germans though.

RATING: 6
Another fun, fast game... But not for the Russians... Although I'll never forget the ONE (and only) time I won as the Russians because the final battle for the 2nd Leningrad hex went my way and the Germans failed their die roll :)

Would rate higher, but I no longer want (or am able) to play games that take a whole day to play any more. If I still played traditional wargames like this, I'd rate it at least a 7.

Don't be mislead by the small size of this game. The box contains a tense and exciting game - the Russians can take a pounding and still win - the Germans can lose but actually feel as though they have won. Despite the size of the map options abound for both sides.

A great game based on the fantastic but venerable Panzergruppe Guederian system. This one is a lot of fun to play, but limited in replay value due to the subject matter (wade through Soviet units, encircling and destroying them as you go, until you get bogged down in the forts and terrain near Leningrad... again). The Decision Games version is cheap, and at $14, it's worth every penny. I scanned and printed an oversized map, which is much better than stacking the tiny chits on the 11x17 map that's provided.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The original SPI edition, of course.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This tiny title is a surprisingly meaty game, and an excellent adaptation of the Panzergruppe Guderian system. The German player must overrun like mad and press every possible attack to get close to Leningrad. A couple of times he'll break the front wide open, only for nick-of-time Russian replacements to bar the way to Lenigrad. There's only one scenario, but untried Ruskies provide some variety.

Several of the system rules improve on the original. ZOCs are still properly expensive to exit, but you can now withdraw without combat (so long as one unit stays behind). Stacking is more sensible at three divisions (rather than three counters), and the formation integrity rule has been toned down to a more reasonable column shift rather rather than doubling strength. Finally the untried unit system has done away with the silly zero strength divisions (though the range of strengths is still wide enough to give you some shocks).

Why only a "7", then? The CRT desperately needs to be brought into the 21st Century: there are no mandatory Defender losses even at the most extreme odds. The archaic "AE" result, on the other hand, can wipe out multiple stacks of attackers with a single die roll (even 1940's Russians would call off an assault before a catastrophe like that). And the map would really benefit from being printed on a larger sheet with bigger hexes (it gets awfully crowded around Leningrad).

Finally (no surprise), the original SPI release is the one to get. Though Derision Games claims its re-release benefits from an improved terrain analysis, it also features oddly formatted and hard to read counters, badly laid out and hard to read charts, and a really important ZOC rules omission.

I was the developer on this game. It's a simple, fun wargame that usually comes down to the last turn with an assault on Lenigrad to determine the winner. It's a good game to use to introduce new people to wargames. The production values have always been weak on this game, but it's really much better than its packaging indicates.

Fast playing take on Army group North's drive to Leningrad. Game is very Jekyll and Hyde. In the first few turns it is blitzkrieg as the Germans race to Leningrad, then it becomes World War I as you fight a static battle over fortified positions. Good history, but somewhat dull gaming. I still like it because it is fast but if both players are smart the game turns into who can roll better as there are not a lot of options.

RATING: 7
Played a friend's original SPI version and I do not think this game is nearly as "un-balanced" as some suggest.  

Instead, I think this game is simply completely different for the Germans as it is for the Soviets.  Sure, if the Soviets make zero mistakes it is darn hard for the Germans to win...but then again if the Germans make no mistakes it will be darn hard for the Soviets to win as well.

The untried troops mechanic for the Soviets elevates this game above the forgetable and make this game worthwhile IMO (and gives it replay it would not have otherwise).

I think the main problem with the design is the fact it can boil down to a single roll or two near the end to determine if the Germans can take city hexes, or not and of course without these key hexes, the Germans get zero points and have no chance of winning.  I am also not too sure about awarding the Soviet points *only* for the armor units.  We had a situation near the end where the German could have *easily* fought for a draw on the last two turns instead of trying to (actually) take the city as one would expect.

All in all, a nice, simple, fast game if you don't mind either being on the attack or defense for the entire game.

Edit: Odd, the notes I see for the DG version seem to indicate all the major changes were addressed in an erratta for the old SPI version decades ago (overruns cost 2, 1 for turn 1 Germans, etc)...  Why would anyone want the DG game with the dorky gen-Z counter art again?

I've played twice.  Fun, but I do sort of wonder about how good a scenario this is.  The Germans really need to sprint across the map.  The idea of untried Russian units is neat, and the combat system, columns shifts, etc. all work fine.  I'm just unsure the victory conditions make for a good game.  The Russians just need to prevent the Germans from entering two back hexes of Leningrad.  So while this game is fun to play, I think it unlikely the Germans can win.

Stalingrad on the west, Leningrad on the east.  Slaughtered and siege...It is one of the two cities that Hitler wanted so much.  Should the city fall really, the course of WW2 history would have been rewritten.  The map is smaller (11'x17') than the standard size map but does the job adequately.  I can see some very tense actions before the gate of Leningrad but I am not sure whether the Germans has ever get a real good chance to capture the city in face of a competent Soviet.  Notherless, a good simulation overall.

[Comments based on Decision Games reissue]

A little gem.  Surprisingly good simulation of the advance of AGN towards Leningrad given the simplicity of the rules (Panzer Gruppe Guderian based) and the tiny playing area (1/4 of a standard map).

Eminently replayable with variation provided by the unknown (to both players) strengths of Soviet units.

Very difficult for the Axis to win but somehow this doesn't matter as they usually come so close that there is an incentive to play again to see if the Axis can capture that one extra hex this time.

By the way, the Command game Proud Monster came out of Ty Bomba's desire to expand the Leningrad system to cover the whole East Front.

One of the very best introductory games around.  What's more, even old hands can find it fun and interesting, as it is really tough for the Germans, assuming competent play by the Soviet player; Germans often come one turn short of their objective.  This game has so many pluses: it's inexpensive, it's easy to learn & teach, it's quite compact (both in terms of shelf space and table space) and it presents a challenge for both sides.  Nothing flashy here, but a good, solid game in all regards.

I do not say this very often, at all, but Decision Games got it right: they fixed this game. The changes they made to the rules in their reprint vastly improve the game.

Now don't get me wrong, I loved the original SPI version and played it many times. But, IIRC, we only saw the German's win once, and that was due to catastrophic Soviet luck. Mind you, the goal, the far hexes of Leningrad, were always just out of reach, making the game so alluring for the German player. And the panzers had all the fun.

Well, we just played a game and I had my SPI copy but my friend brought along his DG rules! We used those and the Germans just explodes off the start line, really hammering and killing Soviet units. Our game was a real nail-biter, decided in the last 2 rolls, and the German had nearly a 50% chance of winning!

It was simply a great game.

Those changes:

Overruns now cost 2 movement points, not 3.

German overruns on turn 1 cost 1 movement point.

Units winning an overrun can advance 2 hexes following a retreating unit, not just 1 hex.

The big Soviet turn 7 reinforcements and counterattack is pushed back to turn 8.

Other that that, I really like the Redmond Simonson look of the SPI version. The DG one looks goofy with the silly counter icons.

This was an old SPI title and I have the new edition that I think was reprinted around 2015. This version has a larger map to accommodate larger hexes and off to one side is an insert replicating Leningrad and the six adjacent hexes. This has super big hexes and exist to manage unit stacking as things 'congregate' around Leningrad - though in truth this was more necessary in the original with its smaller hexes.

The game has one of my favourite mechanics .... Untried Units. 

This is a fun game that will sit in an evenings session of play and give both players some challenges.

"Leningrad" is an excellent game, as it's easy to learn and play, yet challenging strategically, and tense toward the end as Germans push the determined Russians back towards Leningrad. 

I especially like the column shifts on the CRT, taking into consideration factors of terrain, forts, or air support. 

It uses the "Panzergruppe Guderian" system, but improves it slightly by streamlining play. The rules are clear, and I really wish more war games were this intuitive and easy to play, which allows me to concentrate on strategy rather than rules. Therefore, I'd place this in a class of fun games that would be excellent introductions to war gaming.

Purchased Decision Games version, July 2008.

RATING: 5
An adequate mini-game (1/2 Quad map) using the Panzergruppe Guderian system.  A good way to both learn that system and to graduate new wargamers from the standard NAW-based SPI Quads to the next level of complexity. The Germans 'appear' to have it all their way for the first half or so but the game is heavily weighted against them. If the Soviets can sequester a few good tried infantry, a couple of tried armour units and several cannon fodder infantry, then the two Leningrad VP hexes can likely be held for a very long time, having a 5 column shift modifier in their favor. Soviet just give up space for men and try to collect and preserve a few good tried units and it's going to be a very frustrating endgame for the Germans. The Soviets receive about a dozen units near the end of the game that will have no impact on the outcome. The special Turn 7, 4 column shift, for Soviet attacks is just a sucker bet; it will only cause unaffordable Soviet losses in Leningrad and reveal the weak spots to the Germans. (Used decimal dice for fractional odds which only benefited the Germans.) UPDATE: New players will be discouraged as the Russians because they won't realize the space-for-time/speedbump/hole-up-in-Leningrad/virtual-lock-on-victory aspect of the game. They'll also be discouraged as the Germans because after crushing the Russians and conquering 98% of the map, they will nearly always lose due to the victory conditions. Might best be played between two new players. Some loss-based victory conditions might also be implemented. Note: If the first turn Soviet counterattack generates at least one Attacker Elim., the game probably belongs to the Germans.

bloodless CRT historically invalid- it makes the german first turn a 'puzzle' to be solved, not a simulationof WW2. and why are the good USSr mech units 10-3-7 and not 10-10-7? cuz the game would be unwinnable for germans. and that '4 column shift on attacks' that ussr gets for 1 turn only is a pathetic design-for-effect to get the ussr to counterattack as they actually did.

This is a fine game and a good one to introduce newbies to wargaming, since it contains all the standard wargame tropes for games of this scale and era.  However, after a few plays it loses its luster: the options are too few and there isn't much meat on the game.  Good for a couple of plays.

Played the DG version which is substantially not the same game as the SPI game - OK but nothing special, fiddly rules, and atrociously tasteless counter graphics. The CRT is the wrong way around - did no-one notice that?? The cleanliness of the original design is lost. It was actually more difficult to play than it should have been. 

Really wonder why DG even want the rights to these SPI games, and what on earth they think they are doing with them. It's the nadir of fiddling. Marketing stuff with the statement "1st edition graphics by Redmond A Simenson" after that kind of redesign treatment is an insult to peoples' intelligence.

This is in a 2 inch bbox as opposed to the normal 1 inch bbox. The coversheet is the normal size so it does not completely cover the box edges.

Solid basic game. On 2nd try, I managed to completely botch the early rolls as German and the rest of the game was not very interesting.......I plan to give it a shot solo.

Very nice game.  It's pretty easy for the Germans to win a tactical victory in the new Decision Games version...but to win a Strategic Victory requires laying it all down on the line.  Go for the glory!

It's quick playing and based on Panzergruppe Guderian.  Why don't I love it?  I don't know, but I just don't.

A fun game with a lot of replay value, brief game time (you can play 2-4 times in an evening). Not a highly detailed title, but fun none the less.

Pretty good light treatise of Army Group Norths effort to take Leningrad. The untried Russian units provides much of the excitement. Perhaps not to much replayability due to the situation.

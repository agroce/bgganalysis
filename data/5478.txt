RATING: 3.5
{1 play • many players} Well, I was very disappointed, especially since the game looks so cool - I mean those wooden animals are great.  The problem is, you kind of "solve" the inital puzzle aspect of it after a few turns... and then it's just about who kind of "remembers" them faster for the rest of the game.  Which isn't nearly as satisfying as, say, the "work" you do in Ricochet Robots.

This is a decent, quick game where the participants race to call out a correct sequence. The 3 figures, a elephant, lion and polar bear (Why is a polar bear in the jungle?) are stacked and a card is revealed with a different stack pictured. The players must call out the moves to change the current stack to the pictured stack using specific syllables. It's sort of a light, kid's game, but fun.

Gana quien al final coleccione la mayor cantidad de cartas.

Nice quick filler. Love those animals. Kids game, but can be fun with grown ups as well.

Rating is valid for 5-10 minute play (just agree to play by time, or play less tiles), after that the fun rating probably drops too fast.

NL: Als dompteur moet je de 3 (houten) beesten zo snel mogelijk van de ene positie naar de andere commanderen. 

Leuk voor een kort potje, bedoeld als kinderspel.

Real-time game. Before doing formal testing, this game appears to be quite good at evaluating frontal functions. I expect a lot of variability in abilities between different players. Components are nice: wooden animals, cards made of thick cardboard... 

Unfortunately, my new box was damaged in shipping (crushed corner).

RATING: 5
It's clever and I'm glad I played it, but no need to own. Like most simultaneous puzzle solving games, a dominant player will clean up and not leave much for the rest. It requires intense concentration, and once you have the hang of the syllable meanings, the novelty of spelling them out (which is the original 'fun' attraction, or hook) passes. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The components of the new edition are out of this world. Game works did it again!

Keep in mind that slower players are likely to get bored if they aren't stuborn enough to go on.

Also if you don't have any kids in the group it is difficult to shout out loud words like Lo-Ma-Lo-Ma and be proud of yourself.

I really enjoy the game and I am very glad to have it in my collection, but I do belive Geistes Blitz is a better game. 

Warning: I played it with a group of kids (6-12) to whom I also introduced Geistes Blitz. Every kid loved the ghost and asked for it months later, none of them wanted to play Crazy Circus.

Excellent simultaneous puzzle resolution game. Simple to explain, hard to master. The only drawback I see with it is that it might frustrate players that don't do so good with the mental exercise of moving the animals without actually doing it. Applying the handicap of removing the word "So" from advanced players is a necessity.

Think fast under pressure - but rather simple problems to solve.  The attraction here are 3 chunky and attractive animal bits.  If that is your cup of tea, this game is for you.  Personally, I prefer to play semi-cooperatively with my young daughter who enjoys the bits and likes to figure out the puzzle on her own....The more I play this, the more I think of this as a very easy version of Ricochet Robot.  You have a starting position and you are trying to move to a finish position.  As most can be done in 2~4 moves, not that much challenge really.  Mostly (entirely?) for kids.

It's like a very simple version of Ricochet Robots: players try to be the first to find a solution to change the positions of 3 circus animals stacked on 3 pedestals into a goal position.  But you must "pronounce" the solution, as the various possible moves are each a one-syllable nonsense word.  I liked it more than I expected to.  it tests the geek/programmer algorithmic side of your brain and the real-time speed adrenalin part of your brain like Ricochet Robots, but also tests the linguistic part of your brain as you must "pronounce" the solution first.

I played the "Ma Ni Ki" version at [[Pionek]] in September 2008.

Very cute puzzle game.  If you are the type that enjoys Ricochet Robot real time problem solving, then this should be enjoyable.  I'm not overly drawn to these kinds of games, but I like them occasionally.  I already have Carrousel so it scratches that kind of itch if I so desire, but this kind of game is good because it plays quick, it is different enough from what else is usually played in a day/evening, and with this game in particular you can play this with large groups. 

For me, getting the silly movement language down is probably more difficult than the actual logistics.

The pieces are out of control.

RATING: 7
This was silly fun.  It's real-time puzzle solving for an essentially infinite number of players, like Ricochet Robots.  You simply try to rearrange the stacked animal pieces from the current formation to the formation depicted on a card.  The hook is that you have to shout out the commands for rearranging the pieces and each possible movement of the pieces has a strange word associated with it.  So you get people shouting out strings of strange words to convey the commands for rearranging the animal pieces.  This makes for a very silly and amusing experience.  I'd be happy to play this filler any time.

I quite like this game: the components are really nice, and as a competitive puzzle it is intellectually pleasant and socially fun. Great and unique filler. UPDATE: discrepancies in skill can quickly lead to lopsided scores and frustration for those that can't keep up. Next time I also intend to try having players write their answers down rather than shout them out, which I feel is more fair on several levels. Rating could rise again pending further plays, but it is so difficult to get a game like this to the table that I'm not sure when that'll happen.

I usually describe this game as Ricochet Robots for kindergarten, and I mean it in a positive way.
This game is simple but unique.
The only problem is you can't really make it harder. We played with having to solve two cards in sequence at once, which was great, but in the end I had to make more animals, more podiums and more command cards.
The components look like small childrens toys which is awesome, but also jack up the price on this a bit.
I dream of a version with smaller components, and just more stuff in the box.

Based on 1 play.  I really enjoyed the game.  The multiple routes to victory seem to work really well and I understood the game pretty much after only 2 turns - both sure-fire winners for a game to  me.  It took a while to play though (about 2.5 hours) for 5 of us.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nothing original but all the mechanisms blend together superbly and there appear to be 3 or 4 balanced strategies to adopt (although initial games suggest the economic route is the better one). There is a bit of luck involved in the discovery element but nothing that is not in keeping with the theme. The components aren't as good as they could be but this is nitpicking. Great theme, great mechanics, great tensions, great fun.

RATING: 9
Perfectly balanced, a lot of strategic options available to win, beautiful materials. It seems to be two different games (worker placement and area control) both incredibly well integrated into one outstanding game. A lot of fun, thinking and choices. It deserves a place in every eurogamer top ten!

After after several plays this is a very good game.  Could of used more silver coins as we were making change all the time, the card stock for the box is way too thin for a box of this size which could of been smaller to start.  Rules are well written and quite clear.  The players that I played it with all gave it a big thumbs up along with myself.  Always look forward to playing this game.  A top 25 game for sure.

An interesting mix of tried and true Euro-game ideas misleadingly packaged as an Ameritrash game (it's not, it's definitely a Euro).

There are 8 rounds of repeating placement actions (think Caylus here), including such things as: turn order, boat-loading (for area-control purposes), merchant ships (for income generation), trade goods (for income and points), building purchasing (for special abilities, points, possibly income), discoveries (for income and points), specialists (for increased placements, think Leonardo da Vinci here), and war (used for area control).

The game is rather lengthy, but turns go quickly.  Seems to scale well (2-6), although I have only tried 2-5, and likely will not play this with 6.  There "seems" to be multiple paths to victory, and there's definitely turn angst nearly the whole game.  Does seem somewhat rough around the edges, but still it's a game that I think about when not playing, which is a rare but good sign for me.  Rating could easily rise.

Own the [boardgame=41261]Builders[/boardgame] expansion, including the [boardgame=114986]bonus tiles[/boardgame].  The expansion adds a few interesting elements to the game: 1) special starting abilities for each of the nations, this is a welcome addition and allows for some asymmetrical strategies, 2) more building tiles, which adds to the variety of the gameplay, and 3) an additional type of "worker", the builder- the builder has 2 abilities- makes buildings cheaper (powerful) and increases the points of controlled regions (powerful).  An easy expansion to integrate into the base game and a must have for fans of Age of Empires III.

Own all upgrades for [boardgame=173442]Glenn Drover's Empires: Age of Discovery - Deluxe edition[/boardgame].

RATING: 6.9
A pretty solid game system that is nominally about exploration. It's really an 8 turn puzzle on trying to assemble the most victory points. The components are "ok" (bad VP track design) but I think the actual map territories should have been larger to accommodate pieces and create more clearly defined territories. If I had one overall criticism of the game, it would be that given the game is about 90% skill, why include the hidden discovery tile/card mechanism (which if a player fails, is incredibly punishing)?  Even though the discovery portion is a small part of the overall choices, it can have a large effect on the outcome of the game as you not only fail at achieving the Discovery VP's and money but you waste all of the men that could have been used to procure other things (magnified as it's an 8 turn game). It's a weird mechanism that is very American in a mainly Euro design. And some buildings are definitely more useful than others especially in Age III. 

Having said all that, the rest of the game works and creates some tricky decisions and gaming angst (if you're into that sort of thing). I'm not a Puerto Rico fan so keep that in mind.

120102 played this on the same day I played dominant species and I realized I don't like complicated worker placement games.  Caylus works for me because it is all about worker placement, but adding area control and set collection mechanisms just makes for a jumbled experience.  And I'm not fond of the miniatures.  I don't mind plastic per se, but I don't like a bunch of garish colored plastic humans that look similar.

This one landed flat with me. I'm not sure why, but I have to say that the overall production value of this title leaves a great deal to be desired. All of the card stock (the box included) is flimsy, thin, and appears to be really cut-rate in terms of production quality. 

This one simply isn't speaking to me... yet. The game play doesn't really inspire me either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent game that grows well, moves quickly, has difficult decisions througout. A few minor usability issues and the need for time to season it a bit prevent me from giving it a 10. Not more than cursory attention to combat in the RTS licensed game, but that leaves room for a solid "gamer's game".

This is one of those games that I do not understand off the bat, make terrible choices, get last place, and end up having a great time! I want to get back in there right away, which is a good sign. If I can figure out some successful strategies and understand all of my options, I'm sure my rating will improve. I don't think this game will become a classic, but it is quite enjoyable. P.S. I don't often say it, but the bits are amazing. UPDATE: wow, this lost its luster quite quickly. I really don't feel like playing it anymore.

Lots of strategic depth and truly multiple paths to victory - more so than most games I've played.  Playing time first go through was 4 hours, which was 1-2 more than I wanted, and this was with 2 experienced players teaching.  Hopefully that would drop over time.  Feels a little like Puerto Rico, but was perhaps more fun.  I definitely like the game, but I hope the playing time drops significantly in future plays.

RATING: 9.4
Juegazo eurogame, que funciona muy muy bien tanto con jugadores noveles como jugones. Colocación de trabajadores, parte de juego de mayorías, y diferentes modos de conseguir puntos, ambientado en la conquista y colonización de América. No tiene ninguna relación con el juego de PC. Tienes que buscar ciertos combos y te tienes que centrar en ciertos aspectos (colonización, descubrimientos, economía) ya que no es posible abarcarlo todo de forma óptima.
Me hice con él en inglés nuevo x 27€ ganga para todo lo que trae. Muy buen juego, excelente de mecánicas y componentes (excepto las losetas de edificio, que el grafismo podría ser mucho más claro). Escala perfecto de 3-5 jugadores, incluso se podría con 6 con una expansión que habría que ver si vale la pena lo que aporta (6o jugador, poderes asimétricos para todos, un nuevo especialista). Uno de mis euros favoritos con diferencia

RATING: 6.5
An average euro that's pretty strategic and with not much luck involved. Worker placement and area control are the most important mechanics found here. I played once a long (4h+ game) and some other shorter plays but in the end it doesn't feel appealing to me.

They went bananas over this at the club today, playing it out of the box...three times in six hours. The last time this happened was with [i]Traumfabrik[/i]. Game of the Year 2007, at least so far [July]. Very clever, very fast and playable, a challenge, a design of real quality. The board art & its graphic design betray the usual Eagle problem. There's no real excuse for this given the necessary basics of the task are very easy to get right.

This game perfectly combines classical euro-style worker placement with the right amount of plastic figures, theme and luck which also pleases the Ameritrasher. There are few games which succeed in doing so.
Although this game has nothing to new with its original title, I think that it might be as succesful as its PC adaption.
The game has many ways and strategies to victory and plays in a fair amount of time.

I played this game just once, so this are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Fun worker placement game with amazing - but still kinda unnecessary - components. I played this game just once, so this rating may go up or down, and I was really enjoying it. I liked the mechanics and the ideas behind the game. Yet during the scoring I realised the thing that made the rating go down for me: the buildings.

I LOVE games where you can build something, but here this part feels too random and also unbalanced. There're building in the III Era that are simply huge amounts of points. I know it's up to the players to find a way to get the hands on them, but by the end I think this just diminishes the importance of the player skills. You can find yourself suddently a lot back on the point track just because someone placed a worker on the turn order before you two turns ahead and you couldn't do anything about it, because this kept happening turn after turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like the game, I prefer it to other workers placement games such as Caylus or Pillars of the Earth. It is a pitty that, as other Drover's games, the grafical desing of the board is so bad. The limits between the provinces are difficult to see and the figures do not fit inside. There is also a number of issues with the Actions part of the board. This guy/publisher really needs better playtesters/graphic designers. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Sadly this game has not much to do with the original PC game. It is a typical eurogame (worker placement and area control). The game itself is nicely done, the artwork and the miniatures are neat, but unfortunatelly the gameplay lacks that "WOW" factor, and by the end of the 5th round can get a bit boring. Although it is highly recommended for noobs who are not familiar with boardgames as the theme can be apealing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great game, with only a few drawbacks all of which concern the materials rather than the gameplay itself. The scoring track is terrible, being too narrow and difficult to place figures onto accurately and without them falling over.

And most of the figures are difficult to differentiate and fall over easily. Easy to deal with - just paint them, and weight the bases with some Basetex or similar.

But, a super game that my group were most impressed with for their first play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of the best worker placement games out there.  Plays fast, looks good, many ways to get ahead and win.  The mechanic of essentially saving a worker for the next round via specialists is brilliant and provides great ways to boost area control of any given spot.  Each specialist has 2 jobs so that even if you can't take a majority, it's still not wasted.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In principle, a decent enough worker placement game.  Probably not as good as Agricola, though it annoys me less.  I think I just don't really like _worker placement_ games that are just that.  Maybe Caylus.  This is a much less exciting game than it appears to be, which is sad.  It's worth trying, IMO, and you might like it a lot more than I do, if you like this kind of thing.  It's mostly well done, with some things I don't care for (the high variance on discovery can annoying).

In the end, the problem (as with Keythedral) is that it lacks an arc and tension compared to, say, Goa.  If I'm investing this time and thought, why not play Goa?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Shorter time length than many of this type of game, which is a plus.  The action drafting mechanism and minimal conflict is reminiscent of Caylus.   The capital buildings seemed very wildly different in power level, some were extremely powerful, and others very weak.  This felt kindof swingy.  Overall I liked it more than most games of this genre, but the imbalance of the building tiles was a big negative.  Some were almost unstoppable and others were nearly worthless.

While playing Age Of Empires III, it felt like a great game with lots of promise. The game itself is easy to pick-up once you start playing, and it seemed to flow nicely.

My problem with AOE3 is scoring and how difficult it was to determine who was in the lead in terms of position, which made it challenging to figure out who to target during warfare. I dislike games that don't have a somewhat accurate representation of how a player is doing during game play that involves anything to do with attacking another player.

In my 5 player game, the distribution was something like 20 points at the end of age 2. At the end of age 3, the scoring for the round doubled or more for all players. After the scoring phases, the total scores were between 69-72. I was fairly disappointed at how close the game scored - we all had somewhat different strategies, but it seemed like it didn't really make a big difference in the end  - we all had nearly the same number of points.

Argh, I'm so sleepy right now, can't articulate what I liked and didn't like about AOE3, and I don't have any energy to extensively complain about the board game layout - except to say that for a map game that includes placement of many game pieces, AOE3 is wildly unaccommodating. 

*** UPDATE 1: After reviewing my ratings, I've decided to lower this one. I would never pick to play this game - so many other great games to choose from! ***

*** UPDATE 2: Lowered this rating again, since the whole package is unattractive and the pieces are hard to distinguish. If this had a better board game design, I would rank it higher. It's now in the trade pile for grooven. ***

My exceedingly few negatives about this game are entirely component related: there should be coins worth five (instead of only ones and tens), and it can, at times, be difficult to distinguish between the different types of colonists.
60% Euro, 40% Ameritrash; almost like a kind of Risk for adult eurogamers! The preponderance of the Euro will keep the conflict and suppression-of-aboriginals elements from being a turn off for most people, IMO. Those features are abstracted just enough to keep from being a problem. 
I'm quite surprised at how easy it is to catch on to the rules. The simplicity of the Euro with the chrome and theme of Ameritrash, I guess. A wonderful degree of tension every turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My first game, didn't catch most of the instruction during the demo because I was standing behind the guy giving the demo. Still, came in third with 72 points in a four player game. The guys helped me a lot. The scores were 96, 84, 72, 68. I would like to play it again. Unfortunately, there was a really rude woman on the table who yelled at me twice like I was her child. In both cases I didn't merit abuse. I was moving the pieces after a player had recorded the score. She hadn't seen him record the score so she barked at me to not move the pieces. Minutes later she was yelling at everyone about where the score cards were. Some people cannot function under the slightest of pressure situations and really don't know how to act with adults. Thankfully the other two guys on the table were absolutely splendid people who were very kind, friendly, helpful, courteous. Overall I had a very good time.

A fun worker placement game where you have to judge your opponents placement to try to get the best spots while still getting everything else you want in that round.  It plays very similarly to Caylus or Agricola in this aspect, but there is also an exploratory and combat element to the game.  It would be very difficult to win using a military strategy, but it adds an element to the game that I feel is lacking from the other worker placement games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
AoE III marries area control and worker placement. I like the combo, and I think it's done pretty well. There's a nice arc to the game as the new world gets built up and players progress.

But I do wish there was a bit 'more' to the game somewhere. All the bits are definitely serviceable and make a pretty good game, but it all leaves me wanting. Combat is probably the weakest aspect. And I wish there was something else to do with money.

Theme is very much present. A straight forward game, with easy to understand mechanics. More of a ameritrash game, than a eurogame. Even though it borrows a bit from Puerto Rico and other eurogames.

RATING: 9
Even though I don't play it as often as I'd like AoE III is always a fantastic experience. It scales well 2-5 players, though is very different for each. It's a Euro, but with the sense of an evolving story; just enough randomness, lots of different strategies to explore, and lots of tough tactical decisions as the slots for worker placement fill up. I love it, and really want to play more often!

My criticisms are to do with the components: a useless scoring track, the necessity of printing some BGG play aids (easily done, that one), and the difficulty of telling the (rather garishly coloured) pieces apart. The game is good enough to overcome these problems, but a new edition where they were fixed would be truly outstanding.

...

Years on, although I still play fairly infrequently I still love it, really enjoy it every time I play.

A very good worker placement game with some interesting new variations on the mechanic and genre.  May 2012, giving it an 8 of 10.

A good worker placement game for sure, but at this point I have come to find the tiles to be a bit overpowered in their ability to decide each game.  In particular, the game seems to come down to who will get the correct tile, at the correct time, in order to win the game.  May 2017, Downgrading to a 6 of 10.

After nearly 700 plays of Caylus this is a refreshing change of pace. It felt more exciting than the cold calculating Caylus. I’m not a fan of luck in games but after my initial play it never felt like it would have a huge impact on the result, which I liked. The military aspect of this game was something that brought the theme to life for me. War in Age of Empires is the cherry on the cake. An all round excellent game and I’m looking forward to seeing if it has the longevity of Caylus. I don’t see why not at this point.

UPDATE: The Capital Buildings felt very swingy. I still think this is a great game but it just doesn't share the same greatness as Caylus so I've rated it slighlty below.

On our first game we started not really following any strategy but by the end of the game we had people doing several different ones...the missionary strategy...some people were going for soldiers and others focused on merchants. It was a close game and a lot of fun. One tiny step below Dominant Species but definitely great.

RATING: 10
My absolute number 1. Very interesting area-control game with very fun mechanics and a lot of tension: colonists asignment, discovery (too underpowered, imho), goods sets, the merchant ship,...

It's becoming increasingly obvious that the highly hyped "many routes to victory" is, yet once more, non-existant. You must colonize heavily if you want to win, with exploration and economy playing only a secondary role. Still, you have a huge range of possibilities to play with.

This game is more fun and more tense version of El Grande.

The game system is Worker Placement but in fact half of the game is focus on Area Controlling as El Grande.

The game has the weak point in setup time that has too much but can eliminate the time by well refined component management solution.

Excellent game. Simple rules, interesting mechanics. Very nice components (especially the coins). Nothing like Caylus as *some* would suggest. Minor complaints: the game box is made of thin cardboard and the scoring track is hard to use due to graphics printed over it and being narrow (but it *is* usable).

Based on 3 plays. Very solid, streamlined design with well developed, distinct ways to approach winning. Also has that key dynamic where, after a couple of plays, one starts paying much closer attention to one's opponents' activities and tries to take them down a notch. Highly recommended.

Rating based on just one play.

It was okay.  There were lots of different paths to victory and lots of things to do.  My big concern is how random some of it is.  Lots of luck involved in winning/losing discoveries and having the right trade goods or buildings available at the right time.

RATING: 7
This game was a bit longer than I'd have liked, but overall it wasn't bad.  There are multiple avenues for winning, which I find to be a great inclusion in any game (I barely colonized anywhere, going for an almost purely trading strategy, and was only 2 points away from winning a 5 player game).

I like the mechanics though, of putting your dudes to different tasks, and the priorities of what you choose influencing what you can accomplish.

RATING: 8
Interesting worker placement that offers a goodly amount of choices.  Still, i wonder how long before it feels solved.  The bits are pretty lousy and need to be tweaked in order to make them more useful; they also felt a bit cheap and looked samey.  Also the board seemed like it could have been designed better and made more interesting to look at.  In general it feels like very Microsoft production.

RATING: 8
Great game that I would play again. Area Majority meets Worker Placement. Very quick turns so little downtime even with 6 players (always a plus in my book). Feels a bit like Caylus a bit like Puerto Rico but with a ton of theme.

Reminded me a lot of the old PC game colonisation with all the workers queuing up on the docks ready for passage to the new world.

Rating is based on one play.  Interesting game, but didn't feel all that unique to me, just a combination of previously used euro mechanisms.  I think that the area majority mechanic is one that really doesn't appeal to me.  Also did not especially care for the plastic pieces and found it hard to tell one from another at a glance. Nothing really made this game stand out for me, but would like to try it again to see how my impression changes.

Playable but not great on 2. Looks fantastic and doesn't take too long to play. A bunch of components which means it's a bother to set up and pack. The board doesn't have a place for the trade goods, which I find odd. It is very much a worker placement game and there's a lot to think about and it's more of a counting game which for me isn't too appealing. The $20 Incan building is over powered, the lucky bastard who can get it from start have a big advantage. The game feels quite bland, doesn't appeal to me.

Pues un refrito entre Caylus, Puerto Rico y (cuentan) El grande. Pero con ventajas. De momento me está gustando mucho. Hay que avisar ya que existe mucha interacción entre los jugados y sobre todo oprientada al puteo. Muchas veces escoger una opción es indiferente para tu estrategia (escoger entre azucar o tabaco) y sin embargo puedes cambiar tu decision jodiendo a un compañero con total facilidad... Sabiendo esto y yendo despejados a la zona de juego se evitan el mosqueo y los piques.
De momento un puntazo y descubrimiento de juego.

A game with very little new.  The bits it has taken from other games - Puerto Rico, El Grande, Keydom, etc, are moulded together reasonably well.  However the two stage training of pieces felt negative and I am not a great fan of direct conflict games, which this is in part.  A couple of the tiles seemed very strong, especially the first age tile giving 20 coinage, immediately allowing the acquisition of two further tiles.  The board was needlessly large.  A standard A2 board would have been better, saving shelf space.  However, a step up from most of its predecessor Eagle Games, making Tropical Games one to watch.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a second game was much more enjoyable and to my surprise I find myself increasing my rating.  I now hope for more plays to confirm my view.

The game is definitely a mish-mash of mechanics from several top eurogames (special power buildings, set collection for income, area influence for points, worker placement a la Caylus). The randomness of the discovery tiles and deck are the biggest detractions from an otherwise good design. The graphic design of the board is also a huge detractor (score track is nearly useless, areas for colinization too small). Relatively scalable between 3 and 6 players.

Nem nagyon találtam eredeti ötleteket benne, de valahogy jól van összerakva. Szórakoztató volt, és ami ebben a műfajban meglepő, elég rövid is. Talán túl rövid is. 2 óra volt a szabálymagyarázattal együtt, pedig élveztük, örültünk volna még néhány körnek. Furcsa, hogy viszonylag egysíkú stratégiával is nyerni lehetett (minél több területre minél több ember), holott a szabályleírás óvaint ettől (hárman játszottunk). Szerintem az épületek szerepe túl nagy, és az új területek meghódításánál zavaróan nagy a szerencse szerepe (de el kell ismerni, hogy a valóságban sem tudhatták, mit fedeznek fel:)). Egyik játékostársam szerint a játék nyomokban hasonlít a számítógépes névadóhoz. Főleg külsőségekben. Összességében jó játék, szívesen játszanék vele újra. Akár egy szuszra több partit is.
---
Érdekes hogy a második parti sokkal hosszabb volt, pedig szintén hárman játszottuk! 3 és fél óra. Most esélye sem volt a területezésnek. Árus stratégiák domináltak. A játék mellett szól, hogy majd 4 év elteltével is jónak tűnik, pedig azóta kb. 500-al több játékot ismerek:)

RATING: 5
Read the rules and very pleased by it.  Seems to be a very solid Euro game with a heavy feel to it.  The fact that it should be able to handle 6 players, is a huge plus.  Ready to purchase.

First Game: 6-15-07
Finally played the game and it is a lot of fun.  There is a lot of things going on.  It is pretty cool as it kind of carries you along a strategy due to buildings that you get from the beginning of the game.  However, this game also rewards plays from the next level that takes into account what others are doing.  The game is pretty tight as you only have so many colonists to deploy.  You cannot do everything you want to do.  I am very happy to have this in my collection as it is a solid game and that it can handle 6 players.  It is hard to find games of this strategic weight and handle 6 players at the same time.  The only one I can think of is Age of Steam with the Netherlands map and Power Grid somewhat.
Initial Rating: 8

UPDATE: 9-1-07
This is the 2nd game that I played using the Official Variant (all discovery tiles are known) and I enjoy the game a lot more.  With it, the game is definitely a lot more deep and strategic.  A new layer of strategy needs to be taken into consideration.  Also, with the official variant, another way is available to gather doubloons to purchase capital buildings.  Before if you just luck out of trade goods, you are in a bad shop as every turn passes you get left behind in the capital buildings race.  With the Official Variant the game is now solidly an 8.  Now I just gotta find a way to fix the Age III buildings.
Rating 8 -> 8

Update: 17-Oct-07
I just played a game that was horrible.  Maybe I am still emotional about it, but it wasn't fun for me at all.  It was mainly due to an opponent that decided to kill my colonist instead of another player which had much more potential (i.e. more income and buildings) than me and I was dead last.  This certainly put me on tilt.  I declared that my colonist must be avenged no matter what and that I shall see blue men scattered about the land.  Then another player said that if I do that it will break the game.  I said I didn't care, but I lied.  So I tried to be rationale about it and just try to come back after after I was just kicked while I was down.   Sigh...  I wrote a lot more to put my thoughts on paper but I accidentally clicked on something which made me just lose a lot of what I already wrote down.  I am not going to rewrite them.  Bottom line is that once you are down in this game it is very hard to come back, unless you get left alone and try to recover.  Unfortunately, you can't do that because you'll just get hit because you are weak and an easy target.  This game really encourages events that kicks you while you are down.  If I do not already own this game, I would never suggest to play this.  But since I own it, I'll give it another chance and maybe come up with another variant for the game.  I just find so many things wrong with this game.

Played twice.  I like that you can acquire various types of "specialists" that have certain advantages.  I also like the area control, the impact that warfare had on the areas to control, and discovering even more areas to control.  Based on actual gameplay, I'd say that AoE is a 2nd or 3rd tier worker placement game, but it does offer something different than Caylus, Agricola or Leonardo da Vinci.   

AoE has a random order in which the buildings appear.  Some buildings are clearly better than others and if you get to go first that round, then you clearly get the best building.  However, you could also select to go first for the next round and randomly get a bunch of mediocre buildings to choose from.  Do I even have to mention how random Discovery is?  Overall AoE III is way too random for the length of time it takes to play.

Update:  Enh.  It seems like a bucketful of rehashed mechanics.  Not digging it as much as I used to.

----------

A very solid Euro.  And don't let the theme fool you.  This is not an Ameritrash game like its license would suggest.  It's 100% worker-placement-action-efficiency Euro and has no qualms about it.

We've played maybe 3-4 times here at my office and I have yet to win.  Fortunately this doesn't sway my opinion much; AOEIII is chock full of difficult decisions and will probably remain in my collection for a good while.

Played 5-player solo and had a great time! This is the next worker placement game I plan to introduce to the game group (they're hell bent on mastering Stone Age at the moment). Yeah, agree with the space problem on the New World layout - what a pain, and the borders aren't too clear either (and, yeah, the similar in some of the characters too). I liked the mechanics though.

There are a number of approaches to take toward winning. Like Puerto Rico you purchase buildings to improve your lot and like Caylus, Pillars of the Earth and Leonardo Da Vinci you allocate your men into different roles to scoop in the victory points. Some combat, some qualified risk taking and alot to balance this game has something for everyone. 

Some strategies are stronger than others and so players need to combine forces to stifle those who are too strong in one area.

First play, long game, too long for my tates, but it was the first game for all of us.  I'd love to play it again with people who have played before to get a quicker game in.  I went with the Monk strategy and p/u the monestary card and had colinists all over the place.  It worked to my advantage as I won by 10 points.  Love to play again and make sure it was not a fluke.

A few new twists on the old resource management, area control theme which is right up my alley. 

The still haven't decided if I like the plastic figures. They seem too similar. A little paint may go a long way to making this game better. We played a two player game in about an hour. 

Update: This plays better with 3 than 2. Still waiting to play this with the full compliment of players. I really like this one!

Awesome game! A worker placement game with a touch of conflict. The special powers and alternate ways you can use your people give this game quite a bit of replayability. Only drawbacks I have to the game are that the box is easily twice as big as it needs to be. Also, the printout on my sheet of Capitol buildings doesn't match up to the cut marks. Adding to my top 100 now.

One playing with four.  I think I went into this game with high expectations and I was somewhat disappointed.  It does have a lot of excruciating decision points, and the game is not really bad.  I do see the possiblity of a Powergrid-esque endgame problem where if the capital buildings you need don't come up but the ones your opponents need do you will lose through no fault of your own, really (I should say this was not a factor in the one game I have played, the winner won quite handily and better buildings wouldn't have helped anyone enough to overtake him).  In fact, I am turned off by most of the random elements which of course is not unusual for me.  All that said, I think there is a decent game here, it just didn't grab me they way my first play of Caylus or even Pillars of the Earth did.

Our first Euro-style game, first play on 4/8/12.  Amazing fun...can definitely see that there are multiple paths to victory.  Rules are fairly easy, although we did have to refer back to the manual a couple of times on the initial play-through.  First play-through was with 3 players, I think our next game will incorporate 4 (and will most of the time).  Can definitely see this game swinging to a full 10 rating, as everyone was quite engaged the whole time.

Update:  4-player game was great.  Definitely changed how the game was played, as it is practically a race to acquire buildings and fill up the specialist slots.  The game is more fun each time I have played it.

Sold September '14, could not get it to the table often enough :(

This is an excellent game and one of those where you always seem to second guess the choice you just made, which means it is both interesting and maddening.  Whatever you do don't ignore the colonist dock, it will bite you squarely in the ass. And soldiers are far less useful than they seem.

RATING: 8
This is the first worker placement game that I ever learned.  I really liked the mechanic from the first play, but I don't enjoy all worker placement games as much as I enjoy this one.  It has enough different elements to keep my mind working throughout the whole game: gathering resources, discovering, populating, and messing with other players. The only thing I don't like about the game is the theme of conquering natives (historical or not, it's still shameful).  The stereotypical images bothered me more than the nearly pornographic images of women in many games. Still, I often find myself constantly pulling this one off the shelf, despite my reservations about the theme. My play logs aren't accurate; I've played it probably closer to 10 times.

Fairly straight forward worker placement game. After two plays the different roads to victory seem to be there and they seem balanced. A problem I have with the game is that it's very unforgiving. If you make a mistake in the first round you won't be able to recover in the rest of the game. The problem seems to more apparant with more players. Still the theme is fairly well incorporated, the rules (dutch version) are clear and well written and the game looks beautiful. Looking to try this one again soon to see if the problems I had with it were just part of the learning experience.

The old world exploits the new world. Gotta be the most hackneyed theme in Eurodom. Add in the play of indentured servitude and hordes of dead natives that conveniently disappear and you've pretty much got a Eurogame lamb in Ameritrash wolf's clothing.

I absolutely HATE the use of primary colors for the colonist/specialist figures. It's a shame because all of the other components are quite nice. The game itself is pretty fun and astoundingly straightforward. Long term planning can be accomplished with experience of knowing which buildings can come out in stage II and III. Short term planning, bluffing/psychology abounds. No puzzle here, just figuring out what other people will want to do and doing it before them. A few different types of strategy to try still. But you probably can't win without some good income in the mid game.

Confrontation can be overt or subtle. You can lose as many colonists to your opponent in the merchant ship competition as you can in battles or warfare. So use this to your advantage when playing with vengeful/victim types.

It's refreshing to see a game play true to it's duration statement. Easily done in two hours, if you don't have to teach. Still, game is so straightforward that it's pretty easy to teach too.

I enjoyed Age of Empires, although I was a little offput by the randomness of the goods tiles, some of the income producing tiles that seemed a bit powerful and the difficulty in trying to identify the different figures available. It seemed that if a player is not kept in check early, he could run away with the game. 

Still, it is an enjoyable worker placement, area majority, and set collection game that gives me the feel of late 70's/early 80's games because of the component qualities.

Very interesting and nicely balanced. Much forced interaction and competition and a lot of 'grab this before he does', generally very enjoyable, lots of paths to victory and it seems like the winner is not clear until the final round, a solid 8. Minor gripes, the pieces are nice (though sometimes it is hard to distinguish the merchant from the colonists) but the box is poor quality and the board artwork isn't very ergonomic - score track is very difficult to follow (esp at corners), areas are often long and thin meaning it is difficult to keep track of which pieces are where or which territories join which others towards the end. Strangely, also no marked spot for the trade goods or capital buildings.

After another couple of plays it is clear that the way to win this one is, like many other games, to watch which route the others take and to choose a route without competition. Buying a building pretty much every turn also seems to be key.

In these respects I found it similar to PR, though the wider variety of options and the greater interaction in the colonies made it more fun in my opinion.

Although rich in miniatures, Age of Empires is clearly an euro in disguise with an attractive theme pasted on: nonetheless, it’s so easy and accessible that it surprisingly turns out enjoyable as well, most likely since micromanagement is minimal. [i](April 2013)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - One of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to limit half-point ratings to a minimum: thus, since Age of Empires isn’t one of them, I rounded down my rating from 6,5 to 6.

Really, really good. I would play it any time, and may go up with future plays. I love the variety of strategies and the quick pace of gameplay, as long as someone knows ahead of time what they want to do. This game has enough depth to really hold its own for a while. I'm not surprised to see it shooting up the charts and I expect it will end up in the top 10 games soon, and may have a chance to stay there for a while. The only drawback I see is possibly a critique from folks who dislike repetition of action, since the first part of each age is essentially the same each time.

The worker placement and multiple strategies make it very much a game of trying to outthink your opponents, which is great.  The one thing I don't like is that once you embark on a particular strategy, it's really difficult to change it if someone else starts doing the same thing better.

My monthly game group really like the PC version of this game.  So much so we all purchased copies of the PC game and would get together nightly to play.  If this board game adaptation is anything like the PC verion then I'm sure it would be a hit.  On the other hand, we all like Starcraft and one of the guys got to play the boardgame adaptation.  He said the boardgame version was not as fun as he hoped and he would never play it again let alone purchase the game.  I guess we'll have to wait and see if someone gets a chance to play it some day or maybe I'll take the leap and hope for the best.

Played a two player game. Pretty good but will be much better with more players. Many choices to make with many strategies possible.  I bought this over Leonardo Da Vinci.

In the games so far Initiative has been used very little.  I think at 5 it will be used much more to maintain a strategy.  This is one of my favorites; I love the mechanics of the game.

I always teach Stone Age first and then use that experience as a spring board to teach this worker placement game. This game plays well with 2 players and usually takes about and 1 1/2 hours. Lots to do and not enough time to do it all. Deep and varied strategy in a fun, relatively simple game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
3 plays, Fun game of economics and exploration.  Blends euro-game mechanics and a light (area control) wargame.  Multiple paths to victory.  Good balance of luck, tactics & strategy.  Some buildings are a bit too powerful and slightly unbalanced, but I hear that there is a more balanced set posted here on BGG.  Moderate learning curve since you really need knowledge of the building tiles to do well.  Probably best with 3-4p and too chaotic with 5-6p.  Nice tension over discovery/exploration since conquering a map region puts the trade goods token up for grabs on the next turn... so hopefully you planned ahead and have a missionary to snatch it up.

** UPDATE 2010: after play 3, it feels like this game takes a bit too long to play, but it's probably just my slow turns and the fact that all of my games have included at least 1 newbie.

** UPDATE 2014: I don't like the luck of the colony points or the range (4-7 pts); it should be tighter or balanced with money (i.e., a low points colony shouldn't also have low money).  The game encourages you to conquer regions by attacking with the strength of 6 guys to avoid losses, but then it is a crap shoot whether you get as many points as your opponent who is attacking a different region.

** UPDATE 2015: I need to try AoEIII with the rule tweaks from the new/deluxe GD's Age of Discovery... (new rule #1) reduce the risks associated with discovery, and (new rule #2) reveal the Age 3 buildings at the start.

Another beautifully put together game. It takes quite a long time to play this one properly, but it's time well spent. Great fun!

This is one of those games where you generally have more choices available than you can make in any turn. making the wrong choices can really hurt you. 

A lot of victory points are earned from buildings (particularly in the 3rd age) and if you have not collected enough money to buy any, then you can be sure that your rivals have done so.

After another play, I still see why this game is popular.  Lots of strategy, some player interaction.  Well produced and fun!  Takes us around 90 minutes to play a game, should be a bit faster as we get more plays in.

Strangely enough this has not been hitting the table for us lately, and after only a few plays.  There always seems to be something else we'd rather play for some reason.

I am no longer interested in this game, as I have Dominant Species which scratches the same itch, and oh so much more...

Game runs smoothly and goes at a decent speed.  The choices presented during each phase are plentiful and they almost all have a reason why you would want to choose one over another.  High production value and a well rounded game.
Downside: Some of my friends are turned away immediately when they see miniatures in a game, which makes this a bit hard to get to the table at times.  Plus, without some form of painting or marking the miniatures blend together a bit too well on the board.

TG. There's something about it that I don't like but can't put my finger on:  The last minute board tweaks for a 6-player game that unbalanced the graphics.  The horribly organized rules.  The war/battle element that doesn't quite fit.  The gaudy colors.

I still enjoy it, and will suggest it for newbies who are up for a game of its length.  It's accessible and replayable.  Sometimes I find myself trying out whacky schemes just to see how they'll work.

Fine civ-style worker placement game. Of course its all about the VPs but there are a variety of ways of accumulating them: discovering new unexplored regions, controlling colonies, accumulating trade goods (in sets), acquiring buildings which can yield extra VPs while giving you other (at times quite powerful) in-game benefits.

Your basic workers are replenished at the start of each round (there are eight altogether divided into three epochs), but there are means to get specialized actors (Captains, soldiers, merchants, & missionaries) which can be over and above your basic workers and provide specialized benefits at the various tasks one undertakes. A round consists of, in turn, placing of all your actors then the activities are resolved and finally income is generated (which can be money from trade goods and/or additional specialized actors). At the end of each epoch, a scoring phase takes place where points for the control of colonies is awarded. At the end of epoch III (and the game) all the additional points for discoveries, income generation capacity, and points awarded by special buildings are all added to one's final totals.

The game flows smoothly and provides an endless series of key decision points. As in any well designed worker-placement game, your need to do more than you can manage provides continuous tension. After just one play I am drawn to this game and wonder at how it evaded me for so long (perhaps too long as it is long OOP). We found three players worked well and even though a new player (me) had to be taught the game, it came in under three hours. Highly recommended.

Downsides are an awful scoring track (which would be unnecessary if they gave scoring chits or something for the territories), a map that is too big/small - there's lots of wasted space on the right/middle - and the colonies on the left are too small for the late game where there are stacks of colonists.

Plastic bits are okay - but it's not easy to differentiate them at a distance, having different shaped bases would have helped. We now switch out specialist when they hit the colonies only keeping settlers and soldiers out there - helps a bit but probably need to put a blob of silver paint on the soldiers or something.Didn't initally like the random pull for discoveries, but with further playing it's fine - discovery is supposed to be risky. If you don't like the risk don't do that strategy :)All in all - started as a '6' now up to a solid 8. Scales quite well too - different game with 2 but still playable.

*** Update, still playing - sure sign this is a solid game, appealing to most of the people I game with. Upped the rating to 9. Would much rather play this than other 'worker placement' games.

*** Update, still a firm favourite - box is slowly disintegrating though. Having the 6th colour is great, 6 player version is rather nasty :)

Designers shouldn't rate their own games.  I just couldn't help it.  I really like this game. :)
The theme is one of my favorites and permeates the game, making the mechanics very intuitive. The gameplay offers the players many deliciously hard decisions that seem small when taken individually, but add up to success or failure in the long run. The game rewards long-term planning, but rewards flexibility and adaptation to opponents' choices even more. There are many long-term strategies and combinations that can be tried (My favorites are: The Missionary/ Colonizer Strategy; The Captain/ Merchant/ Privateer Strategy; The Conquistador/ Discovery Strategy; The Merchant/ Trader Strategy).  Some may work in one situation and not in others.  All this adds up to a game that is extremely re-playable and fun.  

Wooden cubes or meeples can always be substituted by the players who prefer them, but miniatures actually work best in this design!

Were settling the new world and leaving the old world behind.  

This game is a moderately intense trading game with some resource management.  Once again there are various roles such that allow the player to do different things with their turn.  Playing this game will make certain strategies leap out as advantageous.  

In Ages, there are various victory point engines that can be built to get you closer to a win.  There are phases which are bartered for using various types of pieces.  Explorer, Captain, Soldier,  reminiscent of Peurto Rico especially with their each have various funtions.  Depending on what is happening with your opponents and what is availble to barter for, different players will need to choose slightly altered strategies. 

I would like to own this game however as its box is large I have to pass.

Three player game seemed to drag a bit in later rounds as each player had about seven plus placements.  Oddly, I think this might be better with more players as good choices for placement will diminish more quickly, leading to more dumping in the discovery box.

Much better with four.  More jockeying for majority in the New World and placement went faster than with three players.

Un genial juego de colocación de trabajadores y control de áreas con un alto grado de interacción de los jugadores. En algunos casos el tomar el camino de las armas dejará despoblados los territorios, pero sólo con los soldados se podrá puntuar. Un juego complejo, con muchas formas de jugar y más aún de ganar. El factor dado no existe, por lo que el azar en el juego es mínimo y se basa en planificación y gestión del dinero disponible.

I've played solo about 8 times and once with a total of 4 players and I love this game.  I think 2 and possibly 3 players will be more like multiplayer solitaire, but 4 was excellent.  Unfortunately, since it was my game I got ganged up on and came in last but it was fun nonetheless.  I am definitely looking forward to getting this on the table again.

Two plays now (3rd place the second time I think).  I still love it and want to play again.

Three plays... still have yet to win but still loving it.

Almost a year later and this is one of my favorite games.  I definitely prefer playing with 4 or 5.  I thought 5 would be too crowded but played it a week or two ago and it played well.

Two plays.  View of the game improved after the second play.  The mechanics still don't feel tight to me.  There's only a minor feedback from the new world to the old (via trade goods and discoveries).  Compare this to Pericles where everything is tied together and solid.  I'll play this again; it does have several paths to victory and often one has to choose between several good options.

C'est la fin du XVème siecle et un nouvel âge naît. Alors qu'ils cherchaient une nouvelle route commerciale vers les Indes, les explorateurs europeens ont decouvert une nouvelle terre. Les premiers rapports font état de populations étranges, de créatures exotiques et d'une richesse fabuleuse. Les capitaines et les aventuriers, bientôt suivis de colons, de soldats, de marchands et de missionnaires, affluent vers ces nouveaux territoires en quete de gloire, d'or, ou de richesses plus intangibles. Les colonies prosperent bientôt, et les nations européennes vont bientôt commencer a s'affronter sur ce nouveau théâtre.

This was an instant hit with both my sons and myself. Other friends playing felt the same level of excitement playing this boardgame version of the video game. The conflict builds quickly as players compete for the placement of their colonists in the event boxes to get a foothold over their opponents for discoveries and accumulating trade goods for points. Other placement features must be considered to accomplish these goals, such as gaining a merchant vessel, or extra buildings, to name a few. A fun and challenging eight turns of tactical decisions and achievement. I'm not sure the buildings are so unbalanced, though others seem to think this is the case. I have seen a clear victory accomplished by amassing trade goods without purchasing many buildings. Additionally, players could position themselves to purchase or even block, so the more "powerful" buildings are not acquired by another player. This is a true gamer's game, so be prepared!

Gran eurogame que escala bien de 2 a 5 jugadores, con una duracion de dos  horas de media.La mecánica de elección de acciones hace que te estén "pisando" continuamente la jugada, lo que lo hace muy cachondo. Acciones suficientes para que tenga cierta coplejidad de reglas, pero muy combinables lo que lo hace muy profundo y rejugable.

Lamentable que la compañía no incluyera el set para 6 jugadores en el básico.

Not a bad game, but there are some elements to be wary of: buildings, discoveries and goods might be too random. Money seems to be the key, as it affords buildings, which in turn provide advantages/points. Plastic bits are hard to tell apart and the map regions are too small. It is interesting to recognize ideas that were improved upon in Dominant Species, such as event cards affecting all players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It plays like a euro, but without any of the checks and balances of a euro. The buildings can fundamentally unbalance games, leading to runaway winners. In our game, the winner beat second place by 30% and last place by 100%!! 

Why play a Wallace-wannabe when you can simply reach for the real McCoy if you want this type of game?

A lot of strategy can go into territory control, set collecting of trade goods, getting ships (=wild cards) and recruiting specialists BUT that can all be defeated by being at the right place in line when the right building comes up for purchase. 

Puerto Rico has buildings of different powers and values but it is balanced. All buildings are available to all players at all times, limited only by availability. PR has a shipping strategy that balances these buildings. AoE III lacks this check. The session reports on BGG tell of a lot of lobsided wins in AoE III and my experience confirms that.

The one positive opinion I have of AoE III is that it does a good job of relating to its theme. The components, figures of the specialists, moving of colonists of Europe from the right side of the board to the Americas all add to the feel of recreating New World colonization by European powers. This game has the feel of a euro but with Ameritrash killing & conflict, all based on the Caylus/Pillars of the Earth platform.

But in the end, it could not fix this game.

You can specialise in attacking other players majorities on the map.  You can specialise in spimply getting hold of the trade goods - a truly excellent game with much to recommend it.

I don't rate many games - too lazy I guess - and don't think I've ever given a '9' to a game that doesn't really contain a single new idea.  Not until this one, that is.  Although in no way original I feel that Glen has put together a number of existing mechanisms to create a superb game.  OK, it contains a certain element of luck but no more than many games, and we find what there is adds to the fun. If you don't like any luck at all in a game I guess you'd give this one a miss anyway.What is more I get the impression that it has been well playtested so that all of its elements were present is precisely the correct proportions.Unfortunately the size of the box could give the impression of its containing yet another nigh unplayable monster.  But that certainly isn't the case.  The rules of actual play can almost fit on half a sheet of paper - and that's not using type that needs a magnifying glass to read it!

6/6/07 - was waiting for me at my FLGS. Played first game 3er. I think the game will be much meatier with the full compliment of players - at least with three, there was not much angst created during each placement of dudes. There is player interaction when someone puts their dude in a spot before you and then proceeds to take the item you had your eye on.

Things to remember - give extra coins in the initial set up for second, third, etc..; when you send a merchant to the new world you get 5 coins; specialists count in the three required to take the trade good in the New World and in the scoring; initiative is resolved just before the beginning of the next turn.

I enjoy worker placement as a mechanic, and so I enjoyed this game too - as far as it went. With more players, there is more tension; this game doesn't scale as good as some other similar titles. An "every other turn" dynamic develops that gets old. Somehow the "discovery" aspect isn't as fleshed out or fully formed feeling as I would like. I wish there was a bit more strategy involved in figuring out where to explore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Solid worker-placement game with lots of tension and a great sense of progression over the course of the game. The buildings and specialists direct which route you will focus on for a win, and make for some interesting gameplay decisions. 

Unfortunately, the game is terrible with two-players, and should not be listed as a 2-p. game without considerable changes to the rules and/or board. As written, an early building advantage can cause a terrible runaway leader problem in the two-player game, especially when using the "instant effect" buildings and national advantage tiles from the Builder expansion. Also, it doesn't make sense to limit the Colonist space but not the other spaces, making it possible in a 2-p. game for someone to get 20-25 goods tokens in a single game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A bit convoluted.. the pieces are a bit funky too.  Overall, there is a lot going on and a lot of tough decisions.  I think the explore-type action is the best, and there's nothing you can do to stop someone who is doing that... especially in a 5p game.  I'd like to play more.. just to see if that particular action isn't completely broken.

RATING: 8
With all those plastic figurines this game looks like a war game, but in fact it is a typical European game. To win one must find a "golden" combination of things to do and stuff to have. Only the micro management let this game fall short of a "nine" for me, but I guess if it gets more plays this will get routine soon enough, and I will improve my rating.

After one play:  I like it!  Uses the worker mechanic from other games (e.g. Leonardo DaVinci) to create good tension among the players for competing for actions.  I like that there are multiple ways to score, so there is some opportunity to change your strategy to adapt to the situation on the board.  Not sure how much longevity the game will have, but it should be fun for 3 or 4 more plays at least.

UPDATE:  Played 5-player, got one rule wrong (multiple trade ships in a set), but really enjoyed the competition for specialists, space, everything.  Buildings were terrific additional powers for players who purchased them.  I think 5-player was almost perfect, however, I see a six-player game coming up in the near future. Luckily picked up both Black and White pieces, so I have the full set of 7 colors... all nations are open to me, now!

UPDATE II:   Played 6-player - remain enthralled - looking forward to next game.  Each play whets the appetite for more.

UPDATE III:  Played this game about 10 times now - significantly more than I have played 95% of my games.  Remain very happy, enjoy each play, and it gives my "10" games a run for their money.  Solid "9" and I expect this will not change.

Update IV:  It changed, when I clicked it up another half point.  I think my favorite part of this game is how easy it is to understand the rules.  Strategy is more important to the game when everyone, even less-experienced players, is focused on planning rather than understanding.

RATING: 6
Rating based upon only 1 game with 6 players. I feel like Age of Empires III is a medium weight European style game with American influences rather than the other way around. Conflict [i]can[/i] make a difference, particularly right before the area scoring on turns 6 and 8, but other than that, it's only a minor element. It didn't draw me in much as a game, though, and seemed a bit long for what it was. Someone far back, even last in the turn order and low on money and resources, can still play a competitive game, especially via the discovery cards. I was in such a position and ended the game in 2nd place, only 4 points behind the leader and more than 10 points ahead of 3rd place.

Well, what to say on this one. I was biased against it coming in, since Drover's games have been so universally awful and because I sort of resent him clogging the market with dreck. I thought we might be rid of him when Eagle collasped so spectacularly; but no.

Still, in honesty, Age of Empires III is really not that bad. It works. But what it is, once again, is a game that captures the worst of both worlds: the abstract themelessness of a German game combined with the gratuitous randomness of an American game. The impact of luck on this game is gargantuan: the expedition results span a huge range from total screwage to huge bonanzas. And the order the buildings come out in is a major random impact. I'm not fundamentally opposed to big randomness in general, but if you're going to go that way, I prefer the game be a) short, and b) not so bloody pretentious. So the new Thebes works for me, despite big randomness, because it's short, well-themed, and doesn't try to be more than it is. AoEIII, on the other hand, is extremely random while being long, weakly-themed, and trying to be everything to everyone. Maybe it's not a euro/amero divide after all, maybe it's just that those Germans just plain have more experience and are better at making boardgames.

Just to be clear here, too, the theme on Age of Empires III is a total paste-up. Virtually everything is totally abastract. Your average well-done German game, whether it be Settlers: Struggle for Rome, Puerto Rico, Lord of the Rings, Mystery at the Abby, whatever, has a lot better theme. American games need to stop trying to play the theme card, which often consists of no more than nice plastic figures, and start getting working games. Fantasy Flight may have a wide range of issues, but they at least seem to understand how to do theme, generally, if not much else; Drover is trying to emulate the Germans without the talent to do it himself or the support structure to cover for his weaknesses (just to be clear, I don't think he is without talent; if he understood that he needs to build an organization rather than crank out his own half-baked designs, he might be able to do some good stuff).

Oh yeah, one more thing: the physical design on this game is completely atrocious.

All in all, Age of Empires III may have flashy bits, but for the discriminating gamer, there is extremely little on offer here that hasn't been done vastly better by many, many other games.

Sorry, one last thing, then I'll stop ranting I promise: this is what Brian Bankler would call a "fixed fun" game. There is only so much fun available in this game, and adding more players just ensures that each player gets less fun. So fewer players is probably better (3-4). But on the other hand, the game seems clearly targetted for 5, and the effort to scale for fewer seems weak.

Having a lot of plays of this under my belt now, all I can say is that the goddamn thing just works. There are lots of strategic options that are balanced, but not in a way that makes you feel like every action is arbitrary because it scores the same amount of points. The end of the game creates a lot of tension as the new world gets crowded. 

I think the theme is well woven into the mechanics, and have no problem with the expeditions. I have rarely seen luck play an overwhelming part in the winner. But sending less than the max for expeditions is a fun gamble and I really like that element of the game. 

It is a game that requires knowledge of all the buildings to be played well, so playing with various experience levels will not work. With a dedicated group though, this shines. 

I will say that I think it does not handle 5 (or more) very well. Since there are a static number of points to be made in the New World and from goods, the points available per player declines as player count increases. So Expeditions become very powerful, and with it the buildings that support expeditions. This creates turn order problems, and despite adding players makes the game less interactive and vicious.

It plays over 8 rounds spanning 3 ages in which you score each age (and then you score a lot of bonus points at the end of the game). In a sense it’s a much simpler version of Dominant Species as you place your workers on a track, and when every player has placed his workers, they activate from top to bottom.

I like how you have 5 different workers at your disposal, and that these have various powers which give you extra income/units on the board/help you win battles etc. The fact that you have different types of workers really enhances my enjoyment of the game! You need to get new workers, send them to the new world to get goods and score you points, get merchant ships, fight battles against the other players, go on expeditions in undiscovered areas and fight the native, collect trading goods and build new buildings – so you really need to do a lot in the game, but the overall gameplay isn’t too hard to understand. The strategies are plentiful, though! 

A couple of things I dislike are these: the exploration is a huge bummer to me as it’s so random – you can send 4 units and lose, while another player can send 1 soldier and still win… That’s really a bad game design I think, and in my games I’ve removed the 1 and 5 tiles so that the luck is less profound. But it still sucks so much when you send 3 guys on an expedition and you fail, because the penalty is quite severe. This means that most of us just wait until we have a strength of 4 until we go on expeditions. The other spot on the board where everybody can place units is the merchant ship, and I also hate that only the winner gets the ship, and the losers lose every single units they spent… Which makes it very important to win (and in general the merchant ships are very handy in order to get income during the game, so they are important). Some buildings are better than others, and it can be a little frustrating that you don’t know which endgame bonus buildings show up in age 3 as they can have a big impact on your whole strategy.

Having read the rules for the expansion, I cannot wait to try that! It sounds as if it makes a great game even better. AoE works with all player counts, but I have to say that, as is the case with most area majority games, it works better with more players. With few players there are also too many open spots on the board to place your workers on.

Mediocre worker placement game with multiple paths to victory. Some buildings, though, are hugely powerful. The set collection (ala Africa, Tikal, etc) seems tacked on and uninspired. The figures are not always easy to distinguish and the borders of the colonies are also indistinct.

Mixed bag after first play. I was sort of impressed. The worker placement aspect was pretty good, and tense. The gameplay has little downtime with meaningful decisions. The part I'm having trouble with involves the balance issues with some of the advancement tiles. Also the discovery tiles are random and can greatly effect a player. I surely don't mind playing, the game was fun enough and strategic, but my have to be in the mood.

Terrific job, Mr. Drover! It is clear the delays were for a good reason as this strikes a very nice balance between the games of my youth (mostly Ameritrash) and the more elegant Euros that my family now likes to play. This also has enough direct combat (v. indirect competition for resources typical of a "conflicty" Euro) to satisfy the high-schooler left in me.

RATING: 10
Totally love this game on one play, so it can only go down but I hope it doesnt.  It has elements of Leanadro Da Vinci, Puerto Rico and El Grande, but with some interesting and fun ways these elements mix with each other.  You go around the table placing workers in areas that represent actions, and for most of them you want to be there first to get the best benefits.  One of the actions is sending people to the New World, where the game suddenly feels like El Grande and you are trying to get majority or second majority to score points three times during the game.  But you cant move guys into these new world regions until they are opened up by discovering them (another action) which is another way to score points.  Lastly, you are also trying to build up an income infrastructure so that you can build buildings with special powers such as extra workers or big end game point getters.  Its an exciting blend of three games but with extra elements like uprading your workers to have special abilities for the next turn. This one plays with little downtime and quick decisions, yet it offers a wonderful strategical backbone for scoring points combined with the tactical placement of workers.  Add in too many things you want to do on your turn and this one shines with the brightest of them. Oh, and the bits are amazing.

RATING: 7
Age of Empires III (or now Glen Drover's Empires) is worker placement and area control done right. It's one of the early flock of worker placement games, but in my estimation, it has held up very well. 

One of the reasons I like it is because the game feels different from the typical "Euro cube pushers." It looks gaudy, with an awkward map and tons of plastic pieces. But behind the plastic and gaudiness is a solid design, with plenty of angst in choosing your locations for your workers, and a lot of jockeying with other players. I haven't played it a ton, but I've seen multiple viable paths to victory. 

Some of the pieces are easy to confuse, so I ended up painting the bases different colors (white, gray, gold, brown) to better distinguish the "special" units.

Update -- ultimately sold this one off. It's not a bad game... it just never got played in my local group. I didn't enjoy it enough to try and lobby to get it to the table.

An interesting blend of Puerto Rico, El Grande, and Caylus.  But feels decidedly derivative.

Immediately after 2 games I gave the game an 8.  Now that some weeks have passed and I've contemplated buy it myself, I feel its more of a 6 or 7.

I would like to play again, but won't be heartbroken if I never do, and that says something.

I'm looking forward to playing this one more often.  I like the marriage of Eurogame mechanics in this game (pieces of Puerto Rico, El Grande, and Caylus), which work well together and don't seem too derivative.  Plays relatively quickly, has a variety of approaches, and has really cool looking plastic ships right there in the box.

Tentative rating.

Summary plays:

0) (prototype)  Unanimous summary: Please stay with the wood cubes and small(er) board.  (Instead production version went with annoying plastic and a bigger board)

  1) 6 players is too many.  4 is fairly clearly the sweet spot.  Toss the plastic.  Use poker chips and wood cubes from other games.  

  2) Never bothered with the plastic, went straight to wood cubes and glass bits.  Game called on account of time and lack of interest.  Not clear that playtime is stable.

  2) 6 players is too many, go for 4.  Lose the plastic and go with wood bits.  Can't see the board for plastic, they're unstable, and they just get in the way.   From a German game design vantage this has the core of an extremely good game wrapped centred on the inefficient translation of multiple currencies, but it has been run away from and hidden with extraneous and distracting crap.  The central good game has now been fairly thoroughly lost.  Too much chrome, too much variance in goods and buildings, contention is too lumpy, not enough value for planning, too much of a hormonal boo-yah feel-good game.  Doesn't seem to have isolated its audience.  It is strangely common to not know whose turn it is.  Needs a conductor.

Personal summary: Overly chaotic with too little reward for forward planning beyond risk management and positional flexibility.  More of an experience game than a competitive excellence game.  Nice concepts of multiple currencies but exchange rates and methods are poorly implemented and arguably unbalanced and disconnected in several areas and then the economy is regularly sabotaged by luck factors. A bit of a systems game, but without sufficient connection among the systems, thus players are forced to advance along several systems fronts in order to attempt risk management.  Remarkably poor presentation (plastic bits are overly large, unstable and and indistinguishable/undifferentiated, board is twice the size it would need to be with reasonable bits, art is super-saturated/garish with poor use of focus and visual direction).

Great Game that balances many styles of play. For me and my brother this is the one game we will always play because we can both pursue our favored strategy's. My Brother can pursue his economic victory while I can also play my mixed aggression with economic growth. To me this feels like what civilization the game should have been and could have been (after all it's made by the same company). A great combination of Puerto Rico mechanics and a combat system.

Played this game several times after selling it...and I think I regret doing that now. It's not very original but plays well, with multiple viable paths to victory (I'm biased towards using soldiers in some capacity, though :-P ).

Tanga pickup in November 2008. My initial impressions of this game are very positive. We played a four player game and everyone enjoyed themselves. There are lots of choices and lots of ways to score points. The suspense as the third age rolled around was fantastic.

After more plays I believe that this game is great. It is a very challenging and rewarding experience. If it hadn't been for the deal on Tanga I would have missed out on this amazing game.

Arguably, this is Glenn Drover's best game.  While some claim it is a Puerto Rico-Caylus hybrid, I think it is better than both of those games.  Game flow is very intuitive and while the first round plays very fast, it is just as easy to pick up the game from this round.  There are many choices to make and paths to victory but not a lot of punishment for making the wrong desicions.  

I also like the fact this game can easily expand to 6 players; because of this, I hope to introduce it to more people in our gaming group.

Fun game but the dolls are hard to tell apart.  Plus the game has one of the worst designed game boards I've ever seen.  Scoring track is unusable, we use poker chips.  The dock is super crowded.  Tons of space wasted with the title and the Atlantic Ocean.  America hardly has room for all the little dolls.  Some of the player aid/reminders on the board cannot be seen because the colors blend together.  I just cannot believe the board could be much worse.

Oh, the game?  It's very fun.  Economic, multiplayer with some conflict.  8 thumbs up!

Finally got a chance to play this at CABS. 6-player game moved along quite nicely. Love the bits. The game itself was interesting, but I'm not sure how balanced. We played with the expansion. I chose a discovery-heavy strategy and was not rewarded with a complementary Age III building in the game, so I was almost guaranteed to lose. Need a way to know what buildings are or could be in the game since the expansion adds buildings and makes it more likely that an Age III building you might want isn't going to be available.

Good theme and mechanics. i wish warfare was more effective. Plays better with more people. Overall a good time but I'm not 100% sold on the depth yet.

*after a couple more plays I think the Discovery mechanic is a little crappy. Sending an expedition and getting 0 points is pretty off-putting. My last game it happened a couple times and started to remind me of pulling nothing but dirt in Thebes. This game seems too long and deep to have such a luck bias. Dropping my rating a bit.

RATING: 4
It's an Eagle...ahem...Tropical game that I would play again, so yes, this is vastly surpassing my expectations.

AoE is another in the increasingly vast stable of designs that uses the "place piece on this square to get thing, no one else can occupy the same square" mechanic, but then combines that with area influence, a bit of combat, some special power buildings, and a touch of exploration.

At the start of the game, each player has 5 standard workers. These are used just like Caylus workers, they are set onto spots to generate effects. Some can gain goods, which when collected in sets, create income. Others can be sent across to the discovered areas, while others can be sent to discover new places. There are also special people types such as missionaries (who create an extra piece when they arrive at a colony), merchants (who have various ways of generating money), captains (who are good for discovering new places), and soldiers (who can aid area majority fights by shooting people).

So if I had to nutshell this it would be Caylus, with more random elements, but also with a few more things going on. Random elements include the trade goods that come up (important because sets of at least 3 are much better than singletons/pairs), the order the buildings come up (also important if you want to pursue particular strategies), and probably most critically, the discovery tiles, where you gain points and income if you have enough to defeat the natives, which are randomly of strength between 2 and 6. The discovery thing reminded me strongly of War! AoI, a game I am not at all fond of. If you gamble (i.e.: take less than the full allotment) and get hammered by the natives, you have just lost many, many actions. When you couple this with the "ok but not amazing" payout structure for discovery, one can see why people complain about the randomness of those natives.

There are some things to like here though. Unlike Caylus, or a lot of the other titles coming out in this genre, there is significant differentiation in player positions based on the buildings they can acquire, which give special privileges ala Puerto Rico. (Of course, now that Agricola exists, differentiation of player positions is taken care of by another game as well). Anyway...almost all of the buildings seem very good in certain situations or combinations, although it does feel like the ones that generate bonus pieces into your pool are more powerful, because those will in turn give you more actions which, at worst will be useful for sending to the colonies (area majority fights) or to discover (some decent spare points). Not surprisingly, these are put out randomly, so even being high in the order gives one no guarantees.

Falling behind the piece curve seemed to be a sure-fire recipe for defeat in our game, and the winner had the largest stable of free guys each turn. I think this does highlight another thing though, the early game economy. Generating money is a real bear. It is used mainly for buying buildings, which can give that nasty differentiation I mentioned above) but the only real way to make money quickly is to either get one of the buildings that generates money (probably my first choice), or to get the building that spawns merchants. Having access to that money will in turn beget more money, more buildings, and a bigger number of actions each turn. Thinking about it some more, I just don't see how someone could win if they weren't keeping up with the "guy pace" set by the person with the most buildings.

Scaling is something I wonder a bit about as well. With 5, the competition for specialist guys and any of the finite demand areas becomes heated, and people end up sending guys out to discover just because there is nothing else to do with them. By contrast, it seems like 3 would be very loose. This is all because there is no built in scaling to the action part of the board. It seems like it would probably be best with 4 because of that. I would not want to play this with 6.

Playing this with 5 also highlighted another huge problem for this game, probably my biggest beef, and that's the size of the left side of the board coupled with the bits. Not big enough. The colonies are thematically depicted, for the most part, by long, skinny land masses. This is fine when only a couple of pieces are present, but when the pieces are taking over, it becomes very difficult to tell who is where. This is just bad graphic design. The pieces, while neat in theory, also can be very hard to tell apart at a distance (or when they're lined up tightly in the colonies) and I think they exacerbate the graphic design problems. If I really liked this game that much, and owned it, I would probably do a graphic re-design of the map with big, square colonial areas, and would likely also replace the pieces with wood blocks or some sort of clear, distinct shapes to make them easier to tell apart at a glance. Being able to tell what types of pieces your opponent has should not require asking them specifically (and perhaps giving away your plans in the process).

All of this aside, I think the game itself is decent, in a relative sense. I don't think there is much in the way of new ground here, but the melding of stuff comes together and at least works. I do think there is a not insignificant degree of luck in certain phases of the game, but for the designer, this is expected. The game feels like it has a lot of rough edges though, and the balance of the strategies doesn't feel like it's there. Early advantages seem to snowball, and it can be difficult to offensively interfere with those leaders because they have more resources than you do. Though I initially rated it a 5, I would tend to avoid playing this in most situations, so it has to be dinged back to a 4. At least it's better than Pillars of the Earth!

Likes: A solid worker placement game that does not have too much downtime. The specialists are a cool mechanic of the game that I don't think is used by too many other worker placement games.

Dislikes: The game doesn't really reflect the game play mechanics of the computer game. Also, some of the buildings are stronger than others and is really the only way to gain more workers.

I like this game, but formulating and following strategies seems very difficult.

Loooove this game. Every time I play it I love it. It always promotes in depth analysis after the game. 
This game also scales really well with 5 and 6 player games being very intense. 4 player games are competitive but players have elbow room and can end up dominating one facet of the game. 3 players is more relaxed and the shorter play time suits the different atmosphere. 2 Player games are surprisingly intense because of the lack of discoveries and the increased value in screwage.
It does not hurt my enjoyment that I seem to grok this intutively and thus so far do well. 
It is quicker than first impressions made out.

There's a decent game at the core. But the randomness for discoveries is too much for me. I heard various suggestions on how to fix, and I think any would be better than rules as written. I also dearly wished that the 4 unit types were more readily recognizable at a glance, rather than just slightly different molds from the same color of plastic. Some of the early buildings can be extremely powerful, and it seems (from my one play) extremely difficult to come back without getting a good income going. I have a slight bias against games where your strategy hinges upon knowing what specific hidden tiles will come up for purchase. That is, you can't really play the game unless you understand what these all are, because you need to start playing for them [i]before[/i] they come up.

Like Imperial except no Rondel and you do have one team you are rooting for.  It is more of an economic game than a war game, at least the way we played it.... I suppose you could attack it as a war game but you would have trouble in the final round scoring I think.
Game time was 2:10 as a 2-player first time playing, I think it is accurate as 2 hrs with 3 or less.  With (5) I could see this being a 3-4 hr game.  Not a bad thing but you should be aware of this going into a 5 player game.

Played with 2-6 players. Fabulous game.  Quite a few different strategies.  Constant player interaction.  Can be played quite quickly with an experienced group (about half an hour per player).

I have painted my Dutch colonists and specialists - see the AoE III image gallery for pictures.  I may yet paint the other nations - we'll see.

The only tile that can cause the game to be lost in Age 1 is Incan Gold.  The players should never allow one player to buy both Incan Gold and an income generating building (whether through taxes or through merchants) on the same turn.

Stunningly disappointing on many levels.  What should be a rich and interesting theme ends up taking the phrase "thinly pasted on" to new heights.  The physical production and design leaves a lot to be desired - frustratingly irritating most of the time and often getting in the way of game play.  Most importantly, the game seems underdeveloped.  It has none of the cleanness of a well designed German game and seriously lacking the fun found in a well designed American game.  A missed opportunity.

A simple worker placement game without too much fuss, although it suffers from undue chrome and subsequent usability issues. The basic game is not too bad, but contains nothing worth writing home about. Workers can be used to place them in provinces (for VP and a little trade), or used in an effort to secure trade goods (for money and at the end some VP) or used to gain more workers, ... And so forth. Repeat for 8 rounds, note who obtained the highest VP score, done.

What I didn’t particularly like about this game is that the discovery tiles and cards are pretty much a crap shoot, and that buildings necessary for some strategy paths may or may not turn up. In the first game I played I found myself investing heavily in good tiles, which at round 5 or 6 caused me to conclude I wouldn’t score highly. You don’t get many points for them at the end on their own, and it leaves you vulnerable to New World tactics of other players. The approach must be more of a mixed bag. Okay, I can dig that. But now for the clinger: My partner happened to invest heavily in goods too, had even more of these than I dud, and happened to be first when the third age started... With a beautiful tile ‘1 VP per good tile’ up for sale. Stating that was like trusting the cat to keep the cream would be an understatement. She won by a margin of about 20 points. So there you have the nasty catch: since you can’t claim both first place in turn order as well as first place somewhere else you‘re forced to gamble. It may work out; it may also not work out. I’m not amused that this can make or break a player’s chances at winning the game. Even with a more mixed strategical approach for all of us there would still be the uncertainty of buildings benefiting one player significantly more than can be made up by the other players through other means. 

Something similar applies to the discoveries. I can build up a significant force only to find out it wasn't at all necessary, and that my investment was pretty much wasted. It can also happen the other way around, when a force isn't sufficient, and then quietly curse the additional 'bonus' of having told the rest of the world what they need in order to secure that particular tile. In summary: the game actively hinders you in performing an action by making the outcome of that action you've committed to uncertain. It's not as bad as in other titles, but the beginnings of dislike are there just the same.

The result is that I'm wondering whether it'll be worth investing in further. I think it's kinda cute that most negative comments are by now so old they only mention the hot games of those days (Caylus, Pillars Of The Earth, even Leonardo da Vinci), so let me add one more which will cause some to wonder WTF? in a few years' time: Given the subject matter of colonisation and discovery, I would really prefer Endeavor over this not too fragrant offering. Endeavor is gamewise a far more challenging and rewarding title, scales a lot better too, emphasises skill over dumb luck (the game doesn't even have luck), and is ergonomically a lot more pleasing as well. Endeavor sees too little table time as it is already too.

In short, I don’t expect that the game’s rating will ever rise above 5.

Rocked my socks.  I really loved the choices I had to make.  I am not quite sure how long it took to play, because I never really felt like I was sitting waiting.  Excellent game.  Even with a lack of real strategy this past game (I kind of wavered and moved off on another path) I was still able to feel that if I could have just made a couple of different choices I would have won.  And it doesn't seem that the game is forcing it to be close.

Acquired Sept 2007.  Picked up the black pieces for the 6th player.  Upgraded board to 2nd edition to improve the scoring track.

Have two plays of this in now.  It was a bit long, but probably only because I played it with people new to the game.

So far, I can say that I really enjoy it and consider it one of the better worker placement games.  Many paths to victory.  Money so far seems to be key, but I would like to try some different avenues.

One of the greatest joys of being a collector is when you
finally discover an old classic that hits on all levels.
It has everything on my check list for a good game.
Area Control / set collecting / worker placement / easy to explain rules / agonizing decisions / money management
/ colonization theme - check - check - check ......

This game just set the standard of how I now will measure
every other game I own. The only random variable in the game is when you flip the discovery tiles/cards. Yet it is a calculated risk with clear and precise values to base Your decisions on. Failure to discover should not get you upset , but you will feel like cursing your fate if unsuccessful.

Tips for first game: Copy all the building tiles for each age on seperate pieces of paper and make sure all players are aware of building abilities beforehand. Nobody likes to lose because they didn`t know there were some powerful buildings that come up in different ages.

Sadly this game is ( OOP )Out Of Print ,but maybe a reprint is in the making. I hope new generations will get a chance to play this excellent game.

Fun game - interesting ebb and flow of the usefulness of various parts of the board over the course of play. Multiple paths to victory, though the colonies are a huge source of points; you really can't afford to ignore them entirely. Can take a long time if your playgroup is AP-prone.

I prefer two tweaks to the expedition rules: (1) only the player making an expedition looks at the tile/card (so even if you're annihilated, you've gained possibly-useful scouting information - if it was a card, you may keep it for re-draw next time if you'd like); and (2) when you switch to the exploration deck, players may use N exploration-colonists to draw N additional exploration cards (of which they then choose one to explore, using their remaining colonists)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Really almost has no connection with the computer game. But that doesn't mean it's bad. On the contrary, it's a great euro, but the theme of discovering new world is integrated well. On the other hand, the downside is too much focus on economy strategy. So, it's like no other strategy at all, whoever got to the best economy WILL win the game.

Amazing game, similar to Puerto Rico for some mechanics, but with a unique flavor. Don't be fooled by the thousand miniatures and the "ameritrash"/like package: it implements a placement mechanic which strongly reminds the typical european gamestyle and approach. Highly recommended.

Rating and assessment after first play.  I have to admit, this game system works better than I feared it would. The choices are not as obvious as I expected - at least, not yet. The person with the greatest income, cash on hand (and highest number of specialists every turn, for the last five turns) did not win, which was also a bit of a surprise.

I have a rule of thumb for Mr. Drover, though - whatever size of figures you decide on, reduce their dimensions by one-half, and you should be okay.

This game combines the Ameritrash feel of empire building with the deliberativeness of a Euro. To put another spin on it, it's almost entirely a Euro in mechanics, but it doesn't feel like one to play it. It does suffer from some of the issues with Puerto Rico, in that the buildings ('capital buildings') actually undermine the theme as there's a limited number of each and they're more closely aligned with the game mechanics than with trying to evoke a feeling of New World exploration... so, could drop with further plays but probably won't rise any further.

Nice accessible game; lacks certain elements to make it a great game, like a more extensive combat system and really building of colonies, but perhaps that's the charm of the game: nice to play as a lighter game in between with sufficient depth; reward for forward planning is limited

Excellent worker placement game. Interesting idea getting different types of specialist workers combined with simple area control and simple combat.

Cons: last turns can take a looong time as you can count the points of other players to determine your rival (all points are public).
Also the game has nothing to do with the PC game its name comes from except the time period it's set in, which is not necessarily a bad thing but the licensed name is purely a cash grab.

Played this numerous times now, works well as a fun, involved but not overly thinky game to keep the whole group together. Often the default choice when we have 6 people (most people seem to be averse to 3 player games I guess).

Always have enjoyed it, almost an experience game for me rather than a strategic one.

Have played it many times, and it is a very good game. But for me, in the long run this doesn't hold the same appeal. End game buildings can be VERY swingy. 8.5 down to 7.5

RATING: 10
Fantastic game.  The rules make sense with the components and the board.  The scoring is more dynamic than it might seem, and there is plenty of time to recover from a faulty start.  You can argue that the player order contention justifies most of the lucky draws, but the discoveries can make a big difference also.  There are a lot of good mechanics in this one, so it would be great for teaching the craft to new players.  The game can play very differently depending on the approach of the players as well.  This is a strong recommend.

There's definitely some interesting choices to be made - evaluating the best ways to use your various pieces, evaluating the relative strengths of the various 'powers'.

It felt lacking in interaction though - I enjoyed the scrabbles for popular choices but the area control element felt a bit slow-moving and the battles never really felt like a tide-shifting move.

I preferred Minicipium's simpler rules but greater number of ways to affect the current board state.

One of the best worker placements out there due to the great ideia that, for each spot, some workers (colonists) have priority over anothers - it causes the temptation of delaying your commitments in order to see other players run out of "ammo", however, this is no risk free, as one can found himself out of the boat...
The fight for area control in the lands of the New World is also a very strategical one due to the use of soldiers, priests, etc... The fights for the playing order or the tile collection are also great. This is a great game!

A very enjoyable game. This is the kind of Euro/classic game hybrid, with plenty of choices each turn, varied paths to victory, uncluttered rules, and an above average sense of theme. The plastic bits are great as far as I am concerned. I definitely want to play this one some more! It may soon be on my acquire list!

4/11/2009: Ordered second edition on-line.

*March 2013* Did I mention just how awesome this game is? Just played two more games, and it was great. I won both times, but the great part is that I used quite different stratgies for each game. The first was a trade/wealth approach, the second was a colonization/trade path. Any game that allows players to win using radically different strategies is a winner in my book!

I'm sure I would have felt more impressed with this game had I played it earlier. But, now with all the worker placement games (many of them great) out there, it just feels "okay". With the large amount of plastic in this game and overly large box, it certainly won't be one that I'll be adding to my game shelf. The only complaint I have about the gameplay is the randomness of the discovery tiles. It seems to be too crippling to both fail to conquer the natives and almost as crippling to "overpay" and flip over a small VP tile with few natives (you lose your entire expedition either way).

You like worker placement games?  Well, this is way better than Ag.  As a bonus, it's so pretty you have good odds of conning more people into playing.  The rules are not too complex for non-gamers, but they are solid enough for old pros to enjoy.

As a rule, I hate the area majority mechanic.  This being one of the major sources of points in this game, you might wonder why I think so highly of AoE.  The answer is that the game is just that good.  It provides plenty of other ways to score points, so it's not just a popularity contest, but a strategic showdown.

A fine worker placement game combined with some area majority. However, the many paths to victory may be more illusory than real. The buildings seem to be of overwhelming importance and not entirely balanced. You pretty much need to get an immediate infusion of cash and then ensure that it never runs short so that you can buy a building virtually every round. Fortunately, the problem diminishes with more players.

I'll be honest.  I want to like this game. My game group loves it.  It has awesome bits - especially the "chocolate" ships.  There are plenty of choices, so the games aren't the same.  Well, except in one regard - I always lose.  I just can't seem to get the hang of this one.  It doesn't matter what I do, I just can't win at this.  Playing it is like getting a root canal.  OK, maybe not that bad, but it's so hard to enjoy when I see the inevitable happening time and time again.  I have tried different strategies, but they just don't work - for me, at least. This is my Nemesis Game.
So, a good game gets rated lower, because I suck at it.  There's no justice in this world.
One plus is that it does play with 6-players, which means we can play it when all our group is present.

Based on one 5-player game it plays long and is prone to AP. Worker placement with some limited development/engine building and some limited take that in pursuit of area majority VP's and bonus tile scoring. It's a solid design and if this is the type of game you like this will be right up your street. I've grown a bit weary of this kind of game so it's not really for me.

The theme is good but the game doesn't really engage with it in the sense of capturing the original PC game. The take that element of the game is relatively limited which means it's possible for a player to be on the recieveing end of more than his fair share of it, and If you fall behind early you probably stay behind.

Would play again but only with 4 or less players and I don't need to own it.

RATING: 7
Hard game to rate. It's the standard Eagle game fare (even if under a different name). A bloated badly designed game board with the mandatory too small scoring track. Cool plastic pieces and halfway broken gameplay. Some people like it and some people don't. If you like the other Eagle games you'll certainly like this one.

I think this game was fun but not something I long to play again.

Best (and only) score so far: 119 points in a five player game.

Update: KS the new edition as you can play as Denmark. :)

RATING: 4
While this game is interesting, I don't like the conflict mechanism.  The use of soldiers to attack each other is a small enough part of the game that I would have preferred it not exist at all.  It ends up feeling like a worker placement game where one player can choose to hose another arbitrarily by blowing up their stuff.  I would rather have more consistent conflict across the board or none at all.

I also recall some buildings seeming much more powerful than others and navigating that uneven selection wasn't enjoyable as a new player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Every single Euro mechanism that exists crammed in to one game.  So many paths to victory that it is almost irrelevant which one you pick.  Scores will end up spread across 10-15 points, like they always do.  Yay for perfect balance.  And several hours long, with 80% of the scoring at the end.  But the worst part is it's another "conflict by annoyance".  You might as well be playing solitaire, but sometimes you can't pick a certain choice because somebody picked it first.  You have no recourse but being annoyed you can't have a Captain.

Oh, and minus one for having NOTHING to do with the PC game.  Pillars of El Grande, maybe.

I'm starting this out at an 8.  I'm not a big fan of area-influence games.  I really liked the right side of the board (Caylus like)...not so much the left (El Grande).  :)  Still, I think the game is very well done and gives you some good decisions to make.  What kind of specialists you pursue determines your overall strategy.  I went with merchants first, then shifted gears towards missionaries, and then soldiers.  After my first play, I think that money (thus merchants) might be more valuable and the best strategy (especially in the beginning).  But it would take several more plays to prove that as the only winning strategy before I would drop it in ratings.  The components are great.  I love the textured money, but I hate picking them up off the floor.  Do not try to stack these chips!  They are slippery!

RATING: 4
While it looks like Age of Empires III had the potential to be a good game at some point, I suspect that some of the attempts to make it lighter ultimately killed it as a game for me. The numerous individualized random elements added to the game make entire sections of it reduced to a gamble, making it so potentially winning through those areas is very hit and miss. And while you can avoid many of those elements by focusing on the area majority part of the game, you can't avoid the importance of the random civilization tiles (not all of which are guaranteed to come out) or the random trade good tiles without potentially killing yourself entirely. 

So in summary I consider it an interesting game, but it is one of the few were the random elements of the game really kill it for me. So it gets a big negative vote from me.

RATING: 7
Players play a country, colonising the Americas and discovering new lands.  Players take turns allocating colonists in Caylus fashion to specific roles for the upcoming turn.  Then the roles are resolved - colonies spring up, trade goods, merchant shipping, capital infrastructure, discover new lands, etc.  It's all in the quest for victory points and these are earned via region majorities at three points during the game, discoveries, trade income and infrastructure value.  Nice game, very balanced, with a sense of escalating tension as it moves towards a conclusion.  Lots of ideas borrowed from other games, but the theming, engrossing, interactive game play, and a sensible time limit cap earns this one a spot in the collection.  Components are mixed, ranging from great (miniatures, tiles) to very poor (cards, box).  Good game, though.  Rating bumped up a notch after trying the two player game.

Great worker placement game with lots of choices to make and seems there are a lot of different paths to take to try and win.  The only issues I have are some of the figures look very similar, the board can get very crowded and hard to tell which pieces are in which area of the map.  The biggest problem is the layout of the board is horrendously bad.  They should of made the map much bigger and the worker placement part smaller.  Other than that it's a great game.

Played with the expansion which I felt didn't add much to the game.

Great "Eurogame" and a great family game.  This is a good game to play with "gamers" as it is an area control game with features to strategize.

I really don't like the pieces of the game. The plastic bits are awful and the map, while arguably geographically correct, gets so crowded at the end with unclear borders.

RATING: 7.25
An epic Euro, with Ameritrash tendencies, that combines worker placement with unit allocation to create cutthroat choices and copious player interaction. The military mechanisms are so streamlined and simple, yet they simulate a battle's tension and importance with great success. Also, the game plays shockingly fast, which is always a plus.

[b]7.8.09 Update:[/b] The randomness of the discovery tiles, capitol buildings and trade goods is starting to rear its ugly head. As my game group gets better and better at playing this game, the luck elements become larger and larger of an influence in the game's final outcome. My rating is staying the same at this point, but I foresee it moving slightly down sometime in the future.

[b]6.20.10 Update:[/b] This game took a big hit today. The luck just keeps getting more and more annoying. I've dropped this more than a whole point and removed it from my top ten. Unfortunate.

I love the computer game of this name, but was pretty pissed when I got this boardgame and saw how it had no relation whatsoever to the computer game.  It's like the computer game maker completely sold out the name of his game just to make a little extra cash from the royalties.

My group actually liked this game the first few times we played it, but then discovered its lack of replay value really soured us on it.  Finally, there's the way the tiles you buy pretty much determine your strategy for the rest of the game.  For example, if you buy the tile that makes it easier or cheaper to do something, you're pretty much forced to concentrate on specializing in doing that thing for the rest of the game.  And once you've let the early game tiles steer your strategy that way, you're REALLY forced into buying whatever late game tiles reward you for your particular area of specialization.

Gee, whaddaya know.  The guy who bought the early-game tile that makes his ships more valuable also wants to buy the late-game tile that rewards him for having lots of ships.  Who-da thunk it?

We hated the injun-killin' tiles, too.  The line between victory and defeat was just too fine, too total.  Barely have enough strength to beat the indians, and the world is yours on a plate.  Barely fail, though, and you get absolutely nothing for your efforts, wasting a whole round of play for you.  And if you "overkill" the indians, beating them by a mile and a half, and you've simply wasted a lot of effort on them.  The only winning "strategy" for exploring the injun tiles was to barely have what you needed to beat them.  Anything extra was wasted, and falling short was total disaster.

After 3-4 games of this, I couldn't trade it fast enough.  I might get suckered into playing it again, but it certainly doesn't need to be cluttering up my collection of games.

RATING: 7.75
I was pretty taken with this game when I first played it.  In a lot of ways, it's pretty derivative, just a bunch of area majority and set collection tacked on to a worker placement engine.  It really is more than the sum of its parts, though.  There are a number of areas for you to focus in, and you have to decide what you want your empire to do with its time & resources.  

There are certainly some rough edges that you have to get past.  The scoring track is terrible; just use paper.  
The special buildings vary wildly in power level, with many solid ones, some less useful ones, a few very narrow ones, and then a few stinkers which are pretty much never worth it.  (I've considered going through and buffing some of them, to see if they can be salvaged, but I don't get to play this often enough to do real testing.  The other option is to simply cut them.)  
Exploration takes so many people to do (if you want to be sure of success), and could reward you with nothing if you skimp out, that it feels a little weaker than the other possible actions.  
Trade goods can also be frustrating, if the ones you're trying to collect never come out or show up all at once.  
I forgive it these flaws, because I enjoy the game as a whole.

Update: 2 év után az első játék után új parti, végre. Mindenkinek bejött. A játék bonyolultnak tűnik, de még sem az, csak sok mindenre kell figyelni.
A mínusz pontok a figurák jobb-rosszabb  megkülönböztetéséért járnak -jelenleg nem 100%-os: ugyanis bár nyilván vannak különbség , nagy zsúfoltságban gyors pillantással azért okozhat elnézést-, meg a pici szerencse faktorért. Mert h az is van benne, az elsőnél ezt nem éreztem, a második játéknál inkább. (Ez abból is látszik, hogy a 2, ezzel még sosem játszó, simán behúzta az első 2 helyet.)
Ugyanakkor érdekes, izgalmas a játék végéig, mindenképp előre tervezést is igényel, nem csak az adott körre való tervezést, igényes, jó darab. A 10-es felé közelít, de ha egy hajszállal is, de alatta marad. (Ja: és nyelvfüggő, de hát ugye van magyar kiadása)

Rating based on two 4-player games.

Nice risk management aspect of the game, every player tried different way to get the win.

I really like this game. It's what I think a good Euro ought to be. No decision is easy, competition is close, it has aggression in the form of simplified combat, cagey bidding and outright intentional screwage. In addition it doesn't have a single piece of wood in it. Superb choice of materials.

One of the earliest worker placement games and still top drawer.  No dice, but a bit of luck, and always  a tight strategy game.  Very good and one of the few w/p games to have different workers (Manhattan Project/Energy Empire).  The box is a too big and flimsy, certain pieces hard to differentiate and no relation really to the video game (only name and theme perhaps), but overall a Euro game where the theme actually makes sense and works!  AoE III permits multiple paths to victory (unlike say Agricola), without a runaway leader problem.  Works well 2-5, though of course more conflict with higher player counts.  I appreciate the extra cards, building s and trade good counters meaning no game will ever play out exactly the same.

I haven't played the builders expansion featuring player powers yet, nor GMT's Dominant Species - a heavier version of this system.  Not sure what Tom Vassel is on about with saying ships being overpowered, but suspect they overlooked the 1 ship per trade set limit, so I don't see any flaw or 'nerf' requirement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This one starts off at a 7 for me.  I don't really like this much direct conflict in a game.  I like that there is no dice rolling for combat, but the fact that you can essentially 'exicute' anybody who doesn't also have a soldier present is a little excessive.  

I don't like the all or nothing bidding on the ship, either.  Nothing is worse than spending 3 or 4 colonists on a ship and then not getting it.  It's much too damaging to get in a bidding war and then lose.  Your whole turn is shot at that point.  Those are my big gripes.  I have to say this is one of the best Eagle/FF games lately, though.  I'd put it right behind RRT.

There's no big things that I can say about why I don't like this game. It's just lots of little things that add up and gnaw away at my sanity. On top of that it's long. :(
It takes the caylus/pillars of the earth type of gameplay where you go around in order and put a guy down somewhere to pre-program the turn.
Depending on what players have done earlier, the players will have differing numbers of workers with different special abilities. Sounds interesting until you realize that everyone likes to keep these in their hands to avoid mixing them with unused pieces, and so you get to ask "how many guys do you have left?" for two hours, as this is always important.
There is an aspect of set collection, which has a telephone problem, since it feels like someone should stop someone from getting a large set. (3 furs come up on one turn and the first player goes to trade? Who's going to stop him?)
There's an aspect of area control which is easy to do once it gets to you, but impossible to plan ahead very far for.
On top of this, you get varying amounts of VP depending on what cards you flip up. but wait! you might not get it if you didn't blindly allocate enough resources.
Components:
Looks pretty, but the plastic figs are many times hard to distinguish. (how many guys do you have? uh, which ones of those are merchants?) There are building that do different things with the same picture, and building that do the same thing with different pictures. The score track is artistically obscured.

RATING: 3
Ok. Forget the name. Alright, this game is an interesting worker placement/engine building game. I did alright on my first play, and found the game to be pretty accessible. 

Maybe on the edge of being too long for me, I'd definitely play again though. Also, I'm kind of burned out of heavy games with the area control central mechanic. Granted, I find that mechanic in this game to be extremely thematic, the idea is just tiresome to me.  

2nd Play: The length, and randomization of discovery are very disappointing to me. Why include such a luck factor in such an otherwise open information game? At best, this is a poorly playtested element of the game. At worse this game is broken for it. For a game with such a random element, this game is way too long. 

Don't be tricked by the multiple paths to victory idea here either, much like how you absolutely need a 3rd family member quickly in Agricola, you need to have a strong presence in the new world to win. So, yes there are many ways to get VPs in this game, but those are more or less secondary to getting guys in the new world.

RATING: 6.5
A fun game, with a number of different elements that work together pretty well and a good theme.  After 3-4 plays there do seem to be a couple of parts that are slightly less than polished - clunky or unbalanced - but also more strategy to figure out.  Also a little too much luck for my taste, especially in the discoveries.  So not a perfect game, but I do enjoy playing it quite a bit.

(I suspect this might go down if I were to play it more, though... at 3-4 games I am still in the exploring phase)

Update 7-20-2015: Played this again recently after a pause of many years. Although there are some flaws in terms of balance and randomness, I still had a really good time. Up to a 6.5

I think it is a well designed game with compelling theme and nice components.  I'm nudging my rating from 7.5 up to 8.

Ok... I had written off pretty much any game by Mr. Drover as one I wouldn't want to play.  After having heard from a gamer with the same opinions that this was one he was going to BUY, I played it that night.  (He buys very few games).

I was surprised.  This is a very good game with a psuedo-random element of building offerings / commodities available; but with the ability to 'manage' them.  The mechanics are quite good, and there is a lot here which could lead to many plays without a mechanical feel.  (I think those that disagree haven't investigated combat to its fullest potential... but this is not a 'wargame'.)

I do dislike the scoring track (difficult to see at places, and very small); and the bright, plastic pieces can be tricky to differentiate at a distance.  (If I was to acquire, I would paint the bases similar colors to compensate)

I have acquired, but have not done any paiting.  The Euro crowd as moved on, and with a new addition to the family; I haven't the time atm.

Excellent game, took me a while to `get` the rules but the rules are pretty well complete as written. Once it gets going nice and simple to play, but a nice feeling of lots of options, no turns left with nothing to do, always too many things to do. Does not feel unmanageable despite options, always plays nice and clean. Wish component quality was better, board a bit lighter than some other games and box a bit flimsy, colours a bit too washed out and similar. Still a new classic, great fun and one we will play lots and lots in future.

Well-designed game, but I am not thrilled with the graphic design.  It is tough to see what is going on at times.

RATING: 7.5
I do well at this game which I attribute to the fact that I'm a generalist gamer by nature, and this game rewards the "little bit of everything" approach. Those people who want to specialize in one way and hammer it home are naturally frustrated if the capstone to their strategy (i.e., the right capitol building or certain goods) doesn't arrive. I argue they're going about it wrong. This is more Agricola than Le Havre.

For discoveries, you go with five until all the 5s are gone; otherwise think of it as the known cost to explore and don't risk going with four dudes. You might get hosed relative to other tiles, but you'll get something that's worth VPs and some money. Just don't make it the heavy thrust of your strategy. For the goods, recognize that you'll have to use a turn when you're high up in the turn order to secure a chocolate boat (as we like to call them) to complete a set. Do that twice at least and you're good.

The game handles 5P very well and turns are lightning quick. There are different paths to make points, and the game forces you to constantly adapt rather than doggedly pursue a strategy you had chosen on turn 1. For me, whatever weak points the game has are far outshined by the game's strengths. Highly recommend to anyone interested in worker placement.

An ok game, I certainly can't turn my nose at the quality of the production, but I found myself wishing the game had more tension and drama, like Struggle of Empires. The end result is a lengthy set of action selection and resolution steps that detract from the visual appeal and the excitement of the era.

Perfect Game, fantastic components, nice art and a game play which brings you in the middle of the colonian time... Flavour.
Perfect worker placement and resource management game with a little bid of risk by taken over new grounds in the new world. Which fits perfect to the game background.
 (But still you could decide by your own if you want to take a risk or not by placing more or less figures.)

I find that this game is a Eurogame that doesn't feel like a Euro game. It is a bit more action-packed, or at least seems like it when you're playing.

I like this game, but I can't help but feel like the a strong economy is pretty much the only viable path to victory, since it powers your empire throughout the game AND provides you with direct victory points.  The 3rd level capital buildings also cause huge swings of fate, but perhaps that can be mitigated with repeated plays.

Still, good times.

One of the better worker placement games, but still a worker placement game.

Many different routes to win.  One of my friends made the observation that he didn't buy the expansion because he didn't think there were 6 different ways to win so some players would simply be splitting strategies.

The only worthwhile game by G. Drover; other games I tried were unmitigated disasters.  Nothing new here but well put together with good tempo and relevant choices every turn.  I felt engaged throughout and the multiple avenues to victory were diverse enough to obfuscate who's really in the lead.  Yes, there can be wild random swings in the Discovery outcomes, but without these, the game would just bog down in analysis.  Would play again.

Playing this game a lot lately.  So far I've experienced a couple 2-player games and a few 4-player games.  Most plays have been with 3.  Every time the game has been fun and seemed to end too soon.

The production standards are good for this game with attractive artwork and components.  Only real complaint is the score track is sometimes hard to make out.

This game provides excellent decision making every turn and planning is required to be positioned correctly for scoring and purchases.  Great fun.  Both my wife and I enjoy playing this - even in 2-player games.

This is completely unexpected: according to Thornquist and Staton, this is a pure Euro design. Comparisons are perilous for obvious reasons, but the two names mentioned as having some similarities are Caylus and Puerto Rico? From Eagle Games? Even if it crashes and burns, this I gotta see. On radar. I just hope to dog that they don't stuff this with plastic miniatures. That would ruin any Euro-style feeling that they may have been aiming for. Wooden cubes, baby, wooden cubes. That prototype picture seems to be something I would definitely be open to trying. *** UPDATE: The game is dead. It was probably a bout of insanity that made me look hard at anything by the now-defunct Eagle Games to begin with. Removed.

This game lives up to the hype.  It really does remind me of a cross between Puerto Rico (buildings), El Grande (area majority), and Caylus (worker placement).  AOE is different enough from Caylus to warrant having both, but I prefer Caylus because of its perfect information.  My only minor gripes with this title are: 1) the luck required when facing the natives on a discovery mission 2) the wide variety in the buildings' worth and 3) the poor quality of the box with no insert to boot.

There is a lot to think about here; I have my reservations about playing this with five or more players but I will have to play again before I can finalise my rating.

Update 09JAN08: It might just be me, but this game seems to play the players.  When it comes to your turn the choices are usually fairly obvious, and no matter how well you think you can play you are simply relying on other players' error most of the time.  I like it, but it's not all that good.

Played my first game Saturday with five players. As said before, you can't do everything but even when you're 'blocked' there are usually other quite good options available. The first go round of capital building purchases should 'urge' you into one of the strategies for victory. (1 free: captain/soldier/missionary/merchant/colonist per turn).Learn how to acquire money each and every turn in order to purchase capital buildings (CB) ideally at least every other turn IMO.I was able to win by getting the Privateer CB ($1/my ship/per other players/turn) and then the Navy CB (3 (?) VP/ship) and the Power CB (2 VP/soldier in the colonies) at the end (five ships and 6 or so soldiers in the colonies. (I started by getting the Inca CB ($20 immediately). None of my CBs had any end game VPs.I only even attempted discovery once in the entire game - in the last turn from the cards (successfully) - so I only received 6 or 7 (?) VPs from discovery.Others thought that the Navy CB was too powerful - of course I begged to  differ ;-) - but no one seriously was attempting to win the ships each turn.The next game with experienced players may not permit such a path to victory.One player would prefer a 4 player game next time and tracking victory points on the scoring track as the CB's are purchased and colonies once there are at least 3 colonists. I liked doing it as in the rules - players can alway count 'em up as most everything is public knowledge.

If you're looking for anything like the computer game, look somewhere else. There is some thematic overlap but otherwise the connection is ephemeral at best.

AoE is a worker placement game. One of the available options is sending your people to the New World where you try to gather victory points through majorities. This is probably the most controversial part of the game since it introduces the only significant element of luck, and it can be quite considerable here. The rules aren't overly complicated, and the game is certainly not the monster of complexity you might expect from the box and the components.

Speaking of the components, the board, while visually pleasant, is slightly dysfunctional. It has some large empty areas while some of the areas where workers are placed would have benefitted from a little more room.

With regards to the gameplay, AoE doesn't bring anything new to the table. It does, however, have a certain appeal for crossover gamers because it's possible to wage wars against each other. Those skirmishes are entirely deterministic but direct conflict is at least unusual in your typical worker placement game.

Received May 26, 2007. Played first game May 28 (Memorial Day) 6-players. Had a blast. I loved the initial play, though there is a bit too much similarity between the Merchant and Colonists and the Soldier/Captain. I thought of marking the base of all Merchants and Captains in a neutral color (gold for Merchants; Silver for Captains), then they could be spotted from anywhere. 
Otherwise, I really loved our first play. Hotly contested, differing strategies (military, discovery, trade, balanced, etc.). I won by 3 points, playing a "balanced" strategy, over a "get extra men" strategy. The Military Strategist (almost solely built soldiers and went to war) finished far, far behind. Final problem - it took 3 1/2 hours, 6-players, all of us, however, were learning and reading the rules.

RATING: 3
Age of Empires lives up to it's hype.  Multiple strategies are available to explore for victory, as well as just enough randomness in discovery draws, and capital buildings to ensure no two games play identically.  Placement of colonists/specialists present a similar feel to Caylus but Empires elevates beyond it by offering conflict, and elements of area control. Not to mention, the decision making is more dynamic as each turn and age changes the values of each option available significantly where as in Caylus there is often a sameness to each decision and very little arc in game play.  Age of empires has a nice balance and no one strategy seems too powerful (if all players are kept in check).  

Update:  Seems this is headed the same way as Caylus.  What initially was compelling, has really let down.  i don't think the engine is poorly designed, rather it seems to not inspire.  In contradiction to my previous posting I now believe the strategies are much more limited, and the replayability falls in line with this assessment.  I don't know what it is with this style of game (place workers), but the initial appeal dies quickly.  I am willing to play if requested but not without a yawn.
From an 8 to a 6.

Update: No desire to play this has dropped it to what it truly is in my opinion a mediocre game.

It's a solid game but I don't like the RNG involved in the discoveries. It feels way too punishing for a euro game when you lose several troops and actions. I would prefer playing with the variant where all discoveries were known or mitigated the RNG from it.

Above text copied from Empires: Age of Discovery

I prefer the age of empire powers and that caused me to give this game a slight bump in rating compared to the reprint. I still need to play the reprint with other variants and I only played this one once normally and once with builders expac. I have yet to see all the different empire combinations

Worker placement game, hard to tell mini's apart if they are not painted. Area control, engine building game that has a small war game element. Pretty board, awesome slippery unstackable money and nice bits. Has nothing in common with the other Age of Empire games (board or computer).

Now... let's see. The mechanisms in the game are not something that will make you scream in an orgasm. But they definitely works. Everything's fine.  
This is a game that's always better with higher number of players. 5>4>3... didn't play with 2&6. 
For a few plays missionary strategy seemed really overpowered. But it seems that's just a very, very good strategy. 
 
From play to play I feel a little bit more claustrophobic. I'm not able to do some fast, fascinating moves that push everyone to say: WOW! You're a genius!... or maybe I just wanted to play GO? :D 

EDIT: WOAH! Almost win (100 VP vs 106 VP for the winner) a game in the 3rd age, while I gathered summry about 10 VP in ages 1st and 2nd! This game still has some nasty, interesting tricks that aren't discovered yet.

Lots of different paths to score points makes this one interesting.  There's little down time so it works with 5 or 6 players.  My only concerns with the games center on their being quite a few chances for king making activities and the fact that discoveries are so random  adds more luck than might first be apparent.  Still, all in all, I like the game and if in the mood to accept some luck  and with players going to win and not king make then this one is a winner.

5Aug07- 1 play - I like what I see so far. Giving initial 7. Upped to 8 - I really enjoy it when I play.  We've also come to appreciate the multiple paths available and the player interaction, especially when one of the players is a warmonger :D

1 year later, Sept 08 - I've decided to increase my rating to a 9/10.  AGE is truly a wonderful game and I've now logged 7 plays.  Our group has taught a number of newcomers and each one says the exact same thing when we finish playing "That was Great!" With so much choice and various paths to victory, AGE excels.  Should I get specialists?  Also, each specialist can be used in two ways (except Missionary), so the Captain (for example) complements two different strategies.  Brilliant Game.

The stepchild of Caylus, Puerto Rico, and Mission: Red Planet, it manages to make an interesting synthesis of a range of mechanics without feeling like a jumbled mess. :) Nothing really new here, but it's fun without feeling like a clone.

I put far more weight on game design than production values, but in this case poor production directly interferes with gameplay several ways, so I find myself in the unusual position (for me) of lowering a game's rating because of its artwork and layout. The generally good quality components are marred by stupid, novice graphic artist mistakes. The scoring track is covered by decoration several places, making it hard to read. More obvious differentiation between the merchant and basic colonist would be welcome. Some of the long, narrow colonies in North America have created confusion, as the mass of settlers in them visually blend with their neighbors and make it unnecessarily difficult to see the borders and tell who is where. Meanwhile there are vast empty areas on the board, and it's clear that those colonies were squeezed to make space for a stupidly oversized logo, which could have gone in some area that was already empty -- like the mid-atlantic -- if it was so bloody important.

The box is flimsy and damages easily, but the pieces are durable enough.

The balance of a few capital buildings is also "suspect."

I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty sick of this cookie-cutter "Pillars of Caylus da Vinci" genre.  You know the type: "Today, our store has the following 25 items for sale.  Please line up your errand boys and select one item each.  Then you will have the pleasure of using your items to swap around money and goods and victory points and manpower and infrastructure and . . . ."  "Ooh look honey, this store has majority control, too!.  Wow, it's just like you said - Age of Empires III really is the Wal-Mart of board games!"  I can see the appeal of Age of Empires III, and I would definitely play again if someone else suggested it.  There is a good deal of tension involved in timing and prioritizing your limited actions, and the bounty of actions available keeps the game interesting, allowing several different approaches to the game.  But I'll probably never play the game enough to see whether these strategic paths are well balanced against each other.  There are just too many frustrating aspects of the game (even after I've made allowances for the haunting "been there, done that" feeling that permeates everything).  The board is very ugly, the victory point track is nearly useless, the territories of the New World are poorly drawn and shaped, and the pieces themselves are ridiculous - unwieldy, easy to knock over, and much too difficult to tell apart at a glance.  The boom-or-bust "discovery" system also bothers me.  I would prefer "draw two, discard one," but would that make the discovery tiles/cards too strong?  With better materials and graphic design, I might have considered buying this game.

It looked dry when I read the rules and saw the components (what's wrong with wooden cubes?), but it was really intriguing and interesting and I'm looking forward to test different strategy paths in future games. The only negative thing is that it's difficult to keep track of who is in the current lead, but that might change with some more experience. Best of all is that you can NOT consider it a wargame, although there are some warfare. I would rather call it a race and influence game.

Like any good worker placement game you are very constrained with the number of options each round. With five players I think you are too constrained and you could really get hosed and you can't really focus on strategies, but with four it is much more managable. Either way the game is really tense nailbiting experience, with lots of interaction and hefty swings in the game.

The game have some rough edges, like there could be kingmaking problems and sometimes pure lack of luck, but as a whole I like i a lot. The game is tense, strategic and interactive.

Even though there are only 8 rounds to play you get more done than in Puerto Rico or Cuba (they feel that they end too soon). Also it offers variable turn order which is a must for such get your engine running and optimization games. The mechanics work well but then I have some ergonomic issues with the map:
Who the heck decided to print such a big and pointless AoS III logo onto the map? Leave it away and scale the new countries a little bigger, so that all Colonists and Soldiers find place there.
Also one could have drawn some squares to place to capital buildings where to logo is. The map is so big but the space is used suboptimal.
Also, graphical ornaments should not cover the score track, which could be a little bigger as well.
When I first saw the ships I thought they're important to explore the new world; nope, they're just a joker for the trade goods... (so they could be realised as well as cardboard).
Normally, the folded map is the size of the box, but AoS has a slighty bigger box with no insert, so all the stuff floats around... but all these are minor issues. The game is fun  I rate it a solid 9 minus 0.4 for above mentinoed issues, which should have been discovered when playtesting. Plus 0.2 for the second edition that I own now.

A great game with 5 or 6 players (I actually prefer it with 6 players), because it leads to a very close game where every placement is a tough decision.  While the game can take about 3 hours with 6 people, it really doesn't feel like it takes this long because every decision is exciting and tense.  A great game that I will always want to play if people suggest it.

Played 5+ times. This plays nicely with 3,4&5 players I have not tried it with 2. Our first game took 3 hours but now games take about 2 hours. This game was the highlight of a recent mammoth gaming weekend I went on. There is a nice time arc to the game play which should keep everyone engaged up to the end. We have experienced one game where the leader seemed apparent from the off which I am hoping was just our group inexperience. I am enjoying discovering different approaches to game play. As I write this it is the game I am most itching to play again soon. Comments written after 5 plays Oct 07.

*UPDATE* 10th play and still enjoying this. We now play with the new buildings which seem to help balance the different strategies. I'd like to see a re-print with a better designed board with the country boarders more prominent. May 2012

I really like worker-placement games, and this one is at the top of my list. It plays fast, it has almost no downtime (even though you still make a lot of decisions every turn) and there are a lot of different strategies to victory. My only gripe is that money seems to be a bit too important, due the amount of vp you can gain from the expensive age III cards. If you cant afford them you are pretty boned, and if you can buy multiple you're chances of winning greatly increases. Therefore you cant let anyone get to much gold (stop them from getting goods and merchants!).

Though it seems that the expansion fixes this somewhat by including some cost-free cards, haven't tried it yet but it is most definitely on my must buy list!

I keep coming back to this medium weight worker placement game again and again.  Why?  Because it provides marvellously polished gameplay.  It's fun in a box.  Thematically flavoursome, 'Age' also offers a number of lines of strategic development to explore, often tested to breaking point by the tactical problems presented to you by your opponents.  And if the gimp with AP slows things down a little, send some soldiers to his colonies and shoot to kill.

Not the type of adaptation that anyone who has played the computer game would expect, but it is a decent worker placement game with many strategic paths.

However, for a game of its weight, the randomness of discoveries is just too high. You have to commit your colonists before you know the number of natives you must match. Since you lose those colonists regardless of success or failure, you may waste a lot of them, whether you play it safe (by excess) or take even a small risk and fail. Also, except for the number of spaces in the "colonist dock", the game does nothing to scale to the wide range of player numbers.

The plastic miniatures are nice, but not distinctive enough. And the colonies may get a bit too crowded with them, thanks to the horrendous graphic design of the board, with a large unused area in the middle and too little space used for the map.

2007-09-06 - on second play raising rating from 7 to 8. Like the rules say, there really seems to be a lot of paths to victory.  It seems like you can really put a lot of eggs in one basket and be somewhat competitive.  Though some of the luck elements have to come your way to win doing that.  First game I played, I did a lot of discovering but didn't maintain dominance in any colonies.  Second game I had a rough time getting any money at all, so I ended up doing some discoveries and loading colonies with colonists and tried to put them in peaceful places.  Came in second though well behind the leader.

Sure, the first time we were all just seeing what worked, but in that, you root out the "Well if he's doing that, I should probably be doing this other thing.  A decent amount of swearing when another player messes up your game plan.  I thouroughly enjoy this game from the pieces, the art (although I kind of wish some of the territories had more area for mans), the gameplay all make for a very enjoyable experience.

Dobra gra strategiczna. Mały element losowości. Drobna interakcja. Wiele dróg do zwycięstwa. Gra wymaga wielotorowego działania. Jedyny jej słaby punkt to działania militarne, które w grze mają bardzo słabe działanie. Polecam wszystkim, którzy lubią gry ekonomiczne.

Too much plastic, quality issues and the fact that I have other games that satisfy the same itch put this off my must have list but a good solid game all the same.  I can see why others love it  - there is no doubting its a good solid game.  However being a newbie, Puerto Rico, Power Grid etc feel just as fresh to me and I'd rather play them instead.

Along with Agricola, tied for second-best "worker placement w/multiple paths to VPs w/economy building w/cube manipulation" game I've played after Tribune, and I've played quite a few. Luck issues and component problems are exaggerated. It's longer than Agricola and Tribune (the other two best worker placement games), but the length is justified.

It´s a good worker-placement game. In this game you don´t just own workers, but 4 different ones and they all have their own function.

Still, there´s too much luck for this kind of game. Could have been much better (better balancing and less luck).

26/07/2008 Re-assesed game ratings and decreased from 8 to to 7.

A game with numerous strategic options.  Do you go to discover new lands, colonise existing lands, obtain trade goods, fight wars or buy constructions.  A strategy will consist of a mixture of many of these actions, but when to do what is the dilema.

I like this game because of the different strategies that are available.  Because of this, I think it will hold up to repeated plays.

Joc de col·locació de treballadors al estil Caylus amb un mapa. Combina moltes mecàniques diferents (col·lecció de sets, compra de losetas amb diferents poders, majories, etc...) L'innovació del joc està en els diferents tipus de treballadors i els advantatges que et dona cadascun d'ells si els utilitzes en llocs determinats.

Peca de falta d'interacció, el "combat" és molt simple i la temàtica està lleugerament enganxada (especialmente en el tema del comerç).

Age of Empires 3 is a worker placement game with an appalling set of rules which I had to read through no less than SEVEN times before I finally got the game mechanics down pat.

Start of your turn, allocate your workers to various tasks.  Then activate the tasks once all players have finished allocating, sit back and see the results.  Repeat for eight turns and score victory points.  

Now why couldn't the manual be that simple?

Fairly standard worker placement and area control euro mechanics hiding behind an Ameritrash presentation. Everything works alright, the differentiation on types of workers specialising in certain areas is a nice touch. Area control largely uninspired, but works well enough. Becomes a little unclear whose workers are in what province. I enjoyed that the first available buildings strongly suggest several tactics to you, giving a definite focus among the myriad options for the first few turns. I understimated the importance of cash to buy Era III vp buildings, and they seem to provide the majority of scoring boost (and perhaps seem a little unbalanced). Overall, conveys the theme well without any unpleasant mechanics, and plays in the right length to give a semi-epic Civ type game. Would play again, but would pick other games over this.

RATING: 8
Great euro-game with a strong theme.  The components are good, though I wish the pieces were easier to distinguish.  The different strategies you can take are varied, and the capital buildings really help them along.  The whole thing works together really well, and the turns flow by pretty fast, with the exception of scoring turns, where some points maximization occurs in the new world, slowing things down if you play with analysis paralysis prone players.  The mathing is obnoxious, but it shouldn't take very long.  The game is so good in so many ways that this one issue doesn't detract from it much.  We played with 4 players, but I can see it working for more or less.  I've also played a 6 player game that worked fine though you had to spend more time doing the "it's your turn"

UPDATE: Played again.  The theme is strong for a game with such simple rules, there are a lot of different strategies to take, it has great production values, and although it is a long game, it goes by fast.  This game is deserving of most of the praise it gets.  I will probably buy the rumored reprint.

UPDATE II:  Played two more times.  Four games of this, and I still feel like there are a lot of strategies I haven't tried.  What a great game!  Even people that just dabble in a bit of everything seem to do pretty well if they are dabbling efficiently.  

I am not ready to pronounce the soldier/warfare strategy dead yet.  I think the key to the strategy is to get an early income stream, (merchant tile or 5$ tile), get the free soldier tile, and then ignore everything else in the game except going to the new world and killing shit.  Turn order and capital buildings that help you are a bonus, and any leftover guys that can discover are a bonus.

Despite looking like another over produced empty shell like Age of Mythology, despite a name that sucks, this is an *excellent* game mixing worker placement, auction, ressource management, area majority and a little war into a coherent whole while managing to stay middleweight in terms of complexity.
Mechanically it is an euro game, but it adds a good part of solid theme and table talk.
Thematically, it fits the same itch as Struggle of Empires , but it is more elegant, moves at a brisker pace and even though Struggle is a fine game, I would always propose  Age of Empires III instead for the shorter playing time.  
I hate the Incan gold tile; I dislike any card/tile that forces other players to react in a scripted manner or loose the game, so I remove Incan Gold alltogether.

I was surprised by this one, as you have to make difficult choices most of the time.  All the mechanics appear to work well together, and they fit the theme.

There are multiple ways to win, and adapting your plan to maximize you every action is key.

The game board, counters and cards are nice.  The miniatures look good but are a tad too colorful (some people will have trouble with the green and blue).  The coins are simply awesome!!

On the down side, the point track around the board could have been done much better.  Why not stop at 100 points and have bigger and wider areas?  As it is, you're better to go to paper, which is too bad.

Would have rated this one a '8.5', but the small and narrow point track drops it to an '8'.

Says on the back of the box that it's "Expandable to six players"...  So when will the 6th player expansion come out?

[After one play that I lost horribly.]

Euro worker-placement game (don't be blinded by the plastic pieces) with one small deterministic "fighting" component, one risky/random exploration step, and otherwise multiple viable and interesting winning paths. Good, rather straightforward strategies. Nice board, but the plastic pieces are a little questionable from a usability point of view.

Not sure if this was because of 3 newbies on the table, but in our 5-player game you could see after half of the game who's is very probably going to be in the first/last two places (aka  runaway leader problem).

RATING: 5
2-28-10
I don't much care for this game.  There is too much randomness for how long it takes (3+ hours).  Discoveries are stupid for this reason.  We had a guy who sent out 5 units each time to ensure he'd get the points, and most of them only needed 3 or 4 guys to do, effectively wasting his effort.  But then another guy was able to chance it the last turn with just 1 unit and happened to pick up a discovery that only needed 1.  Stupid amounts of secret randomness that seem completely unnecessary and feel very counter-intuitive.

Then the buildings are nice and random too.  Not the predictable randomness in well-done worker placement games like Agricola, but just complete 'throw them out randomly' with no way to tell what order.  That and they are way too powerful, and the only thing to sink money into.  Get money early, get big buildings later and dominate.  It's that easy.

Warfare is stupid - being limited to 10 soldiers ruins any chance of a conquest victory, since you simply cannot attack enough people.  I took two buildings to give plus soldiers and ran out by the last turn.  They seem much better suited to discovering, since money is king in this game.

The strategies you would expect to help you out become weak and thin and they're all pretty even.  There is no way to stop anyone else's strategies very much so it's just a race for money and points.  Worker placement done in a very weak way with way too much randomness for how long the game takes.  No agonizing decisions as it's all pretty clear what is open and what you'll be doing, no brain burning, not much fun, just generally mediocre.  I'd rather play just about any other worker placement game.

Smart/fun game. Good for budding empire building gamers. Tough to find a game that us old wargamers will enjoy along with the kids (age 10-16 , assuming they have the usual titles {Settlers, etc}) already under their belts).

What did the kids like? 

1) Lots of cool bits; really dig the missionaries.

2 ) Plays fast - Little downtime (a few seconds) between player moves. 

3) Some war stuff

4) Lots of stuff to do


Big thumbs up.

Rating reflects that is among the best in the lite empire building space.

RATING: 8
Well designed game. Fairly straightforward once you actually see how the mechanics work. I love the many choices you can make to try to achieve success. By and large an area control game, but an actual fun one. The only part I don't like is the soldiers and the end game turning into a quasi-predictable 'the aggressive turdmonkey in your group tries to kill as many as possible', but that is preventable, I suppose, by filling in the war slots to prevent such aggressiveness. Granted, this is more of a personal taste (or distaste for overly aggressive players), but a great game with many valid choices and paths to victory nonetheless.

Very good game, not sure I like it enough to buy it (as it certainly wouldn't be played much) but if I get the chance I'd play again with the geeks, might make less of a hash of things second time round too

Hmmmm 2nd play in and I still made a hash of it. I can still see it is a very good game, just not one I particularly like. Theres a lot to it which I should like but I tend to dislike games which have too many different things going on when it isnt necessary, this is one of those I think

I've now played this probably half a dozen times. It's ok. I seem to end up playing the same nation again because I'm used to being blue but I have now tried being British and Portugese. They're all mostly much of a muchness. I seem to always forget with this game the importance of getting a large number of missonaries and sending them out in their droves out in to the new world.

I get wrapped up with buildings and trade but at the end of the day this a worker placement so increasing your worker count is key (and the best workers really are missionaries and soldiers).

That said, it's also a Civ, lasts as long as a Civ but is nowhere near as good as many other Civ games.

Fantastic game.  This is one of the most beautiful games I own.  The board and pieces are stunning.  The game is long and detailed - just the way I like it.  What a masterpiece.  The only negative about this game is that there are limited paths to victory.  That is why I can't give this one a "10."  However, we all have lots of fun playing it.  I've played a three player and a two player game.  The game scales very well and the two player game was incredibly fun.  I had to downgrade this from a "9" to a "7".  It is getting tedious and less fun the more I play it now.  Most of my games have been two player.  Maybe it would be better with more players?

I like the theme & I like the mix of 'mechanics'.  It's also quite newbie-friendly.  It becomes a different game with 3, 4 or 5 players & it's even OK with 2.  There's multiple paths to victory & the finishes are usually close with a fair bit of angst experienced by each player, especially in the last turn.

Also, I find the rule book excellent (if that's important).

There are some great player aids & scoresheets on BGG.

Does the world need a cross between Caylus, El Grande and Puerto Rico? Possibly, but this isn't as good as any of those individually. The game just doesn't feel 'tight', money is more plentiful than I initially expected and colonist placement choices are obvious rather than presenting much dilemma. Some luck, too, in the Discovery tiles and which buildings come out. Great bits, apart from the ghastly scoring track that was added to the board at the last minute. After several plays I revised my rating downwards. The financial strategy is far too easy to pull off, the colonizing strategy is harder, any discovery strategy is a distant third and military options not worth considering. The constant variant suggestions in the forums tell me that this is a game people very much want to like, but that it's an indifferent game out of the box.

I'm cooling on this.  Part of it is group-oriented; members of our group are very protective of their strategies, which means that it is very difficult to step outside of my usual strategy and try something different.  I'm also beginning to think it makes specialization a little too easy, and a lot of it depends on what everyone else decides to focus on.

Still a very solid worker placement game that combines elements of several games of which I am very fond, and honestly a great introduction to Eurogaming for someone who is interested in learning more.

Parece un ameritrash, pero se juega como un eurogame. No es muy original, pero es más divertido que los juegos de los que deriva. El tema es muy bueno e impregna el diseño de las reglas, haciendo el juego muy intuitivo. Recompensa la planificación a largo plazo. Gran variedad de estrategias. Se juega rápido. Las figuritas me encantan, aunque no el diseño del tablero (no caben en alguna región). Combina varias mecanicas que me gustan: mayorias, gestion de recursos, seleccion de acciones...

EDITO: baja de 9.4 a 8.9 en abril 2013 porque no lo juego apenas.

[ENG]

It looks like an Ameritrash game, but you play it like a Eurogame. It´s not so original, but I find it much more enjoyable than the games which it comes from (Puerto Rico, El Grande, Caylus). It has a good theme that permeates to the rules doing a very intuitive game. It rewards the long term thinking and you can find a huge variety of strategies. You can play it fast (no more than 120' with 4 players) an I do love all these miniatures, but not the gameboard design (there´s no place for the miniatures in some of the regions). It combines three mecanisms that I love: area control, worker placement, resource managment.

Great Game!  Several tough choices to make on your turn.  The games run about 2 - 3 hours but you are always involved so there is very little down time.  The only down time is if you have a player with that has to think over every unit they place.  If that becomes a problem I say break out the 30 second timer.

A very good game which still feels fresh when played. Excellent theme. A bit lengthy if you are of analyzing type. Some randomness with buildings, but it can be minimized with house rules, which allows more precise planning. Keeping track of points is a mess, so we are counting them on every round to have a better idea about who's winning. Money seems to play a major role, but as long as everyone is aware of it, it shouldn't be a problem.

Really like this game.  Lots of choices, lots of ways to win.  Plays fast, and even my 8 year old boy has a firm grasp on the mechanics.

Buildings for extra people are the way to win, extra plays control all.  Buildings for vps and cash for boats are very powerful.

Nice marriage of area control, which I usually like, with worker placement, which I usually don't. Love the theme. the plastic bits are a mixed bag: The ships are awesome, but the dudes are too hard to tell apart from across the table.

Can't get enough of this game.  Have now played a three player, a couple of 4 player, a few 5 player, and two 6 player games.  It was awesome.  14 points was the difference between first and last.  IMHO a three player game is the most different and doesn't allow the game to shine.  However, a 4 and 5 player game is great.  I even love the 6 player game but with the tight choices and extra time it may not be for everyone.  Three player game only took 1.5 hours.  From the several games I have played it seems that you can add a half hour playing time for each player.

Worker placement is my favorite mechanic.  This is a great game, just a step below Caylus and Agricola.  I recommend a variant where the chance is reduced for discoveries.

Unfortunately this title doesn't appeal to me ('unfortunately' because I waited for it).

It looks ok, but I haven't got much fun playing it.
Besides that there are some visible problems with randomness (most notably with Capital Buildings randomly poping up on the table and a lucky player can gain A LOT just by sheer luck; also some one or two lucky Discoveries can determine the winner if the fight for win is tight).

But it's not a bad game, just... average.

Worker placement:Set collection:AC:Economic:War(slight)

Yes another derivative VP collecting game BUT alas another quite good one that is well themed and stands on its own very well. Some aspects from PR & Caylus with area control and a slight war effect thrown in make for a nice overall package.

Worker placement is the central mechanic which will net you all your actions in the game. Actions consist of: Changing turn order, colonizing (bringing units onto map), taking goods, buying buildings, discovering new land, training special units & war. You can also try to win the ship by the way of majority which will count as a "wild" good towards your sets of goods. There are 8 rounds with scoring at the end of round 3, 6 & 8, this works well and gives you time to build yourself up before scoring takes place. There are several paths here to pursue for trying to max out points and this is one of the games strengths.

There are some random elements here to help keep it fresh, goods and buildings which are not too hampering since you still have the power to choose but it also introduces a large luck element of being in the "right place at the right time" aka first in the turn order when the strongest ones come up. (this could be tweaked in that all are face up and known for every round) For these reasons turn order remains very important throughout and having the ability to change it was an important inclusion. Also random are the discovery tiles and cards, these can be a big blow if you get burned as you lose your whole investment (house rule here lose half rounded up?) so we have found it is safer to err on the side of caution and go discovering with at least 4 men (although you can still be burned by a not-so-common 5 doing this). Payouts on the discoveries also vary and is an unknown factor and although money is VERY important in the game it isn't too critical in these discoveries. 

The war effect while very slight was well implememtned having soldiers being able to shoot if you choose war as an action, also soldiers taking each other out first was a good design choice here I think for theme and balance. 

A pretty good design overall if not a little too random but that could be tweaked by 'gamers' that don't like it, everything works quite well together and the game flows smoothly. No downtime or AP which is a HUGE plus for this type of game and should clock in around 2 hours once familiar. Probably best with 4 for time, competitiveness level and control but appears quite scalable especially 3 to 5, 6 seems to be a bit of a stretch here though with no changes to the board but I would like to try it anyway.

Whoa, this game is just brilliant. It combines all my favourite Euro mechanics in a single game and does it well too. The worker placement with variable powers is something I've not seen in any game yet (as far as I can remember). Te top it off, I like AoE III's game board better than the Age of Discoveries' one.

RATING: 5
Pros: Multiple avenues to success, gorgeous (although not spacious enough in the right areas) board and components, nice tension and tough decisions. Fun theme.  Cons: Kingmakery and way too lucky for the time it takes to play it. I'm disappointed, because I like a lot of what this game has to offer; but the luck element dooms it for me. I don't like playing 150 minutes and have a game decided on a card flip (4 VPs are meaningful) or a last turn, "I'll attack... that guy."  Yes, positioning and strategy can alleviate *some* of this--the age old question, "what do you want from a game?"  The game is fun enough and I probably wouldn't turn down a game if it's what everyone else insisted on playing. There's a bit of Puerto Rico here--you can pursue different strategies, but for any given game there's a certain best one depending on what everyone else is doing. We played in a fairly fast group, so I see danger of this dragging. This is a game that risks one of my major pet peeves--not thinking on other people's moves. Know what you want to do beforehand, have an alternate in mind if that's blocked, and throw in an "I'll just do this then" as a last resort.     BGG rank as of 7/11/2007:  31.  Huh?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very elegant, I'd describe it as Caylus with a more clear view of your and others' strategies (I don't like Caylus due to the feel of too many random paths to victory).  Also feels like Puerto Rico with more interaction and the welcome ability to occasionally have conflict, and a much more engaging endgame.  Seems like it would play best with 5 and 4.  3 and 6 players would be less ideal.  A good game with great theme, someone finally nailed it with an American/Euro combo!

RATING: 8
Doesn't come out much for some reason.  Colonize the new world.  Worker placement.  Several choices each turn including recruiting specialized workers and buying buildings with special powers or sending out a contingent to a province in the New World.  Area dominance mechanic to get points.  Plays pretty light.  Challenging.  Lots of getting aggressive grabbing territory from each other.  Buildings not terribly interesting.  Feels a bit unfulfilling somehow but enjoyable when played.

Puerto Rico meets Conquest of the Empire.  I believe this will be held up as the standard for hybrid design:  a Eurogame with Ameritrash sensibilities.  The first Glenn Drover game I purchased was Sid Meier's Civilization (awful rules, boring play), then I bought Attack! (tedious), then despite swearing off Eagle Games I purchased Conquest of the Empire, which quickly became our gaming group's favorite (using Drover's rules, rather than Larry Harris' rules).  Clearly, Drover's designs have improved with experience:  Age of Empires III fixes a few of the issues I had with Conquest of the Empire (too few actions, too many special cards) and repeats great features like wonderfully authentic plastic coins.  Age of Empires III is one of the best board games by an American designer.  After playing it, I have no desire to ever play Puerto Rico again, as Age of Empires is truer to its theme and less abstract.  Plus, it has plasticky goodness!

RATING: 7
Seems to be getting good buz, but $43  (after 30% off MSRP)... my rating after 1 play. It's definitely overpriced probably due to it being over produced.  Board design needs some tweaking, and I'd prefer bits that were easier to distinguish from each other.  Borrows a lot from other games so nothing really original, but a nice blend of them.

RATING: 7
As a design, this game is probably worth an 8 to me.  Not as finely tuned as Caylus, but with more distinct options and special powers.  At first glance it looks like multiple strategies are feasible, which is always a plus in a Euro-style game.  I'd definitely play again, though I did feel like it was taking longer than I wanted it to.  Personal note:  one of the special conditions which actually makes me enjoy area-majority is a special power that gives me lots of extra tokens.  I don't think missionaries are the strategic be-all, end-all of the game, but they're probably the only way I can have fun at it.

However, the components, while very pretty, are less than fully functional.  The plastic pieces are difficult to tell apart at first (colonist/merchant, captain/soldier), but this becomes clear after an hour or so of play.  The money is slippery, which wouldn't be as much of a problem if not for the lack of denominations other than 1 and 10.  Another player had the capital building that gave him one unit of income for each merchant ship.  My base income being 11, I was far more annoyed at having to handle eleven slippery 1-value coins per turn so I could hand over three of them than at losing my purchasing power.  The board is worse.  Given how many plastic pieces are crammed into each region, the regions are far too small.  A few "big colonists" which represent three or five, as Pillars of the Earth uses, would help.  Finally the scoring track is simply awful.  Certain scoring spaces are obscured by superfluous "discovery" images, and the spaces are too small for the scoring markers, which being regular plastic colonists do not stack.  Seriously, the game already has a huge amount of plastic pieces - I doubt five more nicely rendered stackable scoring disks would have blown away the cost structure for a fifty-dollar game.  I strongly suspect we got the score wrong for at least one of our five players, and in a game which came down to two points, that is a big deal.

I usually care far more about function than form and don't like to downgrade titles because of their components.  These components actually interfered with my enjoyment of the game.

Very popular with my two boys. We're having a harder time balancing gameplay between the 3 of us, though. Even changing strategies, we tend to end up in the same order each game, and I think that's lessened our incentive to come back. I'm looking forward to the expansion to see if we can be lured back.

Playtested on 4/8/06 with Keith from Eagle.  A _very_ solid game.  There are some tweaks to the "buildings" which may make for a better 3rd age, but overall, this is going to be a must have when it comes out.

Upon replaying, I like it even more.  The issues that I may have had with the later buildings actually may not be an issue.  I want to play again three or four more times to be sure. . .(are you listening Keith?  ; )   )

Fantastic game! Loved it right from the start and it's a hit with Miss Panda. An addicting game that I would play anytime. After "Builders" came out I made a Variant incorporating a better bidding system involving choosing between an Advantage or Nationality. I also beefed-up the National advantages so that each nation has a specific one for each of the 3 Ages. Glenn Drover approved.

RATING: 5
First impressions are usually hard to shake... here's mine after one play with 4 players.

There seems to be just too many problems with the game... both in design and in play balance. 

Why, in a game about exploration of the new world, is the new world map so damned tiny?  Once a large number of pieces exist, it's tough to tell who is in what region (the pastel colours don't help either).  It seems that the 'action selection' portion of the board is larger than it needs to be, and the new world map is too small.  And there's no place to put the trade goods or building tiles!

The initiative selection is counter intuitive... it's the first action performed, but the turn order doesn't change until the end of the round.  What's up with that?  It should be resolved right away!

A player with an early supply of money or soldiers is going to win... I don't see how others can compete.  Even a single soldier early in the game can provide someone a commanding lead.  A 'runaway leader' in this game is very tough to catch.  I call it the Löwenherz syndrome.

Left-Right Binding is also of major importance in AoEIII.  Sometimes you have to react to the player on your left to the detriment of any other plans you might have had.  If all you do after the first couple of turns is "react to the leader," the game's fun factor drops fast!

I'm sure that the game has been playtested but, for some reason, it still feels "rough" to me.  It's not a bad game, and I'll probably play again, but I doubt that I'll bother buying a copy for myself.

Needs a few house rules to help balance the game.  Allowing multiple purchases of certain tiles/buildings would be a good start... and playing with open discoveries would help too.

I'll give this one a "take it or leave it" rating of '5.'

Pretty slick worker placement/area majority euro. Not too fiddly and makes for a solid piece to any collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A pretty good marriage of theme and gameplay undermined by the randomness of several key elements. The disparity in value between buildings and discoveries is appalling given the total lack of control the players have over which ones they can acquire. As other commenters have noted, this - and the randomness of the trade good draw - takes most of the planning aspect out of taking the initiative; you're at the mercy of the tiles that appear when you decide to do so. It's also unclear how a player who falls behind early can hope to recover. The best buildings add pieces to a player's available stock, which translates into more actions per turn, which means more ways to score and to acquire the money that you need to buy additional buildings. Although nicely self-contained, it means an early setback can be devastating. For a game that takes 3  hours to play, that level of unpredictability is unacceptable.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Solid 8.  This is a very good game, I must admit I didn't think I was going to like it.  After playing it, it is just the type of game that I like.  You draft goods and move your colonists to the new world for a very intense area control game, where you never feel like you accomplish all you want to on your turn because of your limited colonists/many options.

An amazing worker placement game. Add to this tiles "a la Puerto Rico". Many strategies to victory, the adaptation is the key.

I don't feel the similarity to Caylus (a game I love a lot). Caylus is heavier, AoE is lighter, shorter, but with a lot of dept and no luck. Caylus and AoE fill different niches.

Ages of Empires III is a deep, innovative game that blends worker placement, area control, resource management, exploration, and even a touch of combat. All these elements flow together smoothly for elegant, intuitive gameplay. I especially like the fact that the game has five different types of workers (something more games should do). The artwork isn't spectacular, but there's so much game here that you won't mind. A thoroughly enjoyable, impressive game!

Didn't take as long as I feared, as we buzzed through a 4P game in 2 hours after rules explanation. I underestimated the importance of resources and missionaries and fell woefully behind. In mid-game I started focusing on building soldiers, but I really don't see warmongering as a viable strategy, more of a tacked-on element. It's too easy for opponents to wipe out any gains you might make in war by spamming you with missionaries. Not something I would clamor to play again. Everyone else enjoyed it though, so I guess I'm a curmudgeon.

An aggressive worker-placement game! I've enjoyed my plays of this one very much. There are a lot of choices each turn, and the specialty workers add even more decision layers to the basic layout. I do like that you are are not only going head-to-head for actions, but also for majorities in the new world with direct conflict being a very welcome feature.

RATING: 9.5
[2 plays] A great game. Quick-playing rounds make for short downtime, and multiple paths to victory make for an interesting time. There's a little bit of simplified conflict, but it's mostly keeping your eyes on your own path.  It's not terribly hard to learn, but offers a good amount of depth.

RATING: 7
Rating based on about 6 plays thus far; unlikely to rise to an 8, may eventually fall to a 6.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very solid game that borrows heavily in its mechanics from some of the very best Euros and it fits the theme nicely.  On the positive side, there appear to be multiple paths to victory, and the four types of scoring (from buildings, discoveries, income generation and colonists) appear to be more balanced than, for example, the four favor tracks in Caylus.  On the negative side, however (and these factors prevent me from giving the game a higher rating of say 8 or 9), there is the huge luck factor on discoveries (something that can be amelioriated with a couple of house rules, but in my mind an annoying flaw in the game system)-- and on the components end, while the plastic pieces and the coins are very nice, the scoring track (with some numbers totally obliterated in favor of some questionable and very impractical artwork) is an abomination.  So, while this may be the flavor of the moment (as I post this in early July of 2007), I seriously doubt this one will be receiving nearly as much play in another year or even six months down the road.  Of the newer games, I rate it a cut behind Imperial, Through the Ages, Leonardo and Pillars which for me are the still the four best of the past year, although this one is not bad.

Ratings update:  Up to around 12-15 plays now, and I would have to say this game is a very solid 7, would be 7.5 if I gave 1/2 point rankings.  There appears to be no killer strategy that dominates, each game is different mainly because the order of buildings is different each game, plus the four ways of scoring seem fairly well balanced, as witnessed by several really close games played by experienced players.  The only downside is the tremendous luck range on the discovery tiles; if this wasn't part of the game, it might check in at an 8 or even a 9 rating.

This is a great game, I have played it for years and I was disparaging on it for a while because of a few cards that I thought were to strong but every time I go back to this game I find a new way to win. It always has tension, no matter how much I've played...

No, its not ameritrash, but it is not eurotrash either.  Its Drover's umpteenth attempt to marry euro and ameritrash together - until now the attempts have been at best modest successes and mostly horrible failure.  However, AOE3 is actually a lovely mix of some abstraction while still retaining thematic depth.  Most surprising is the 'flow' of the game - it really moves easily and quickly.  Its all about allocating 'labour' to the various tasks involved in conquering the new world - missionaries, soldiers, ship captains, merchants and plain old settlers.  Yes, it is 'worker placement', but the 'workers' mostly stay on the table, now playing the area majority role.  I notice that many of the naysayers glibly note that AOE3 is simply worker placement plus area majority, but the way these two aspects work together is really underappreciated - its NOT an obvious 'evolution' of the worker placement genre and Drover needs to be commended for it.  The 'trade goods' part is a bit underdone but its tolerable.  There are agonising decisions but turns are short so AP should not be a big problem.  A little disappointing that the military strategy is not more potent, but it CAN be important.  The game works fine for any number of players from 2 to 5, but with 2 it is a bit dry and unexciting.  Update:  played more and raised rating to 9 this game is simply good - really does play fast and smooth, and the theme is very well handled.  Its a funny thing - there are a lot of games out there which are technically better designed (Agricola, Princes Of Florence, Goa etc) but I would much rather play this!  Note that you should use the auction variant for deciding starting turn order.

Reading through the rules was frustrating. The details to the resolution step, where you determine the game board actions, can be found 2 pages later and is lost in other rule details. Every time there was a question during a step, we'd have to flip through the pages looking for the answer.  

Now that we have a better understanding, things should run a lot smoother. So far, the game is very entertaining. Lots of interesting decisions to make.

Second game went a lot smoother as predicted.

Love the theme.

Fun and easy game to learn, keeps the spirit of the video games and economy building/trading/battles, game setup is actually quick and easy - provided you have good storage containers for easy access

I highly recommend getting some kind of plastic storage containers(tackle containers, craft containers etc), as there are about hundred game pieces, and this game comes with zero storage options.  Thankfully the box is big enough to hold additional containers.

Nice artwork, but the amount of plastic figurines is ridiculous (too many really). The map is not so well organized. The logotype is actually almost as big as the actual colonies, so it easily gets too crowded.

RATING: 7
Disappointing lack of tension in the game.  The competition for event boxes doesn't seem very intense, and if in doubt just stick workers in the Discovery box for later on.  Competition for discoveries is also weak since most of the time no one knows quite what they're aiming to discover.  There's little incentive to risk a discovery with few colonists because there's no way of assessing the likelihood of success (unless a prior one happens to have failed), so everyone just makes sure they have five before they attempt to discover.  This element of randomness is the weakest part of the game.  I still enjoy playing it, but for worker placement, Agricola and Caylus are *much* better.

This worker placement game isn't for me, although it's got all the ingredients of a great game. It just felt too superficial for me, too much going on and none of it felt relevent enough. I prefer other worker placement games. Sold my copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Two weaknesses let me prefer other worker placement games to this.
1) Luck in exploration - especially in the first round bad luck in exploration can destroy your chances for the rest of the game because...
2) ... this game has the strongest economic snowball effect of the worker placement games I know. If you fail to purchase the civilization advances early on the other players just will pull ahead with the additional actions usually granted by these.
It wants to be more but is killed by its randomness. As Chris Farrell puts it: "I prefer the game to not be so bloody pretentious".

RATING: 8
Nothing new here, but still a very solid game that recycles old mechanics (worker placement, area majority) into an engaging new experience.  Not a terribly interesting theme for me, and sort of an inefficient use of the board space, but I really enjoy playing.  One other minor annoyance - it can sometimes be difficult to tell the pieces apart, and why make some of the countries so small?  There is a lot of wasted space in the middle of the board.

RATING: 7.5
This game feels like a mish-mash of all games Euro. On the left you have an El Grande map (9 regions; all [6][2][0]). On the right, you have a Pillars of the Earth/Caylus sequential action track. 

The game is quite good, it plays quickly, fairly easy to learn if you're a Eurogamer, although the Income system was very unintuitive. I felt the actions were too limited, that players were forced into the Discovery action when there was nothing left to do. And even though there are multiple paths to victory, ultimately everyone just seems to get in each other's way (not because they WANT to, but because there isn't any other action left to take).

Components were great. Artwork for map was crap (it got really cluttered), but the plastic coins and well-sculpted pieces more than made up for it.

I enjoy Age of Empires, but it seems like a strange mix of Eurogaming and Ameritrash -- albeit, one of the better examples. It's a good game that is perhaps harmed by the areas that are luck-dependent. It is fun, though.

Two small quibbles: the money stinks, as it doesn't stack properly; and the miniatures are monocromatic which makes them difficult to distinguish.

While I appreciate WP with special workers, and I think the exploration theme is rather cool, the actions in this game are boring: get sets to get money, money to build to get more money; there's an area majority game there also. Nothing exciting going on.

Congratulations on your discovery of Florida and your new colony there... Wait! who are those other guys moving in? 

Why did the blue player just place his last colonist in a warfare box? That does not bode well.

Finally got to play a couple of times, and had about as much fun and positive response as I expected. basically a solid 10 of a game...I only won't rate it so high because I sort of fear the "hot-newness" factor.
I really and truly believe that this game could be one to dethrone PR...it is indeed, that good.
Alot of choices, on every turn...and not obvious ones. that is what makes caylus and PR suffer a tad (and games like it).  Sometimes, the choice you make is pretty much made for you. Either by someone else's move or the game's inherant mechanics...not so much in AoEIII...you make a decision with every turn. Was it the right one? Who knows?!?!?
Awesome...just awesome. ...Has the feel like it could crack my top 10 of all-time.

Played about a half dozen times now. The painting suggestions - where you paint the helmets of the soldiers, the bags (and hats) of the merchant and the telescope of the captain are critical...otherwise I find it hard to tell the different pieces apart. Just ordered the pieces for the 6th player (black) - hopefully this game plays well with 6. so far it has been a riot with 3, 4, and 5. In my mind, it is like a fun version of Puerto Rico...


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Based on 5 plays.  AoE III is probably my favorite release of the past year.  It combines tactical maneuvering with a broad strategic scope in an excellent way.  Each turn confronts you with an array of challenging decisions.  The game runs a little long with 5, but I'm happy to play even with that number.  The only real complaint is that luck manifests itself in a few unpleasant ways.  I wish discovery had been handled with a little less chance, and that you could count on the appearance of certain Capital Buildings (esp. the victory-point-laden ones from Age III).

UPDATE:
Well, favorite game of 2007 is perhaps a little generous.  Though entertaining, the game's length and the swings of luck from the Discovery tiles make it harder to get to the table than I might like.  I'm looking forward to the designer's next game, which supposedly implements aspects of this one.

In essence a combination worker placement and area control game with some interesting mechanics.  I don't consider it a bad game, but I wouldn't rush to play it again and it is definitely not on my list of games to consider buying.

I think this is the best game I've played in a long time...however, dropped a point because of length.  Not sure why but this one seems to go longer than it should. 3.5 hours for one game?  Didn't even seem like people were taking long to choose moves...  Rating will go back up if I can somehow make this a 2 or 2.5 hour game.

Update:  I dropped the rating of this game again.  It just takes too long.  I don't mind long games but this one feels long.  It should play quicker.  Another problem is that it's hard for first time players.  They will likely get crushed by more experienced players. This is true of a lot of games, but this one especially.

Lots of choices and several strategies available.  Worker placement with an economic engine and some conflict.

Wow, what to say?  Generally, it's not quite my style of game.  The combination of the painstaking "worker" placement combines with the general randomness to create more chaos than I'd expect in this sort of game.

Decent Meeple placement game that has almost nothing to do with the computer game. The eight turns breeze by and there is a certain amount of tension to it as you may well get locked out of certain actions by those going in front of you.

Epic and probably the best game experience I've ever had.

A real feeling of progression as the game continues.

A wonderful combination of several game systems and I would rather play this game than the ones I feel it combines (Puerto Rico, Caylus, Antike).

Many layers to win, but all in all not that complex to teach.

I loved the way war is implemented.  It feels more like a chess match than building up impenetrable borders that demand a huge conflict.

I told myself no more big box games, but I will be making room for this one and (hopefully) expansions.

Miniatures can be a bit tough to distinguish and the map can be hard to read once covered in miniatures.

Very balanced. Not perfect, some strategies like military do not work well against straight up economic ones. I feel like there are numerous ways to play this game effectively and still win, so its lots of fun to try new ways out each time. This game is so much fun to try new things with and your never faced with a horrible game experience, at least in my experience. Great plastic units, tiles and ships, coins are all right but kind of clunky.

Played a few times once a 2 player game and the second time a 6 player game.  Both times strategy turned out to be almost the same.  Going for trade goods and merchant ships rather than a lot of discoveries seemed to be the way things have worked out.
I highly recommend playing at least once it is a fun game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good exploration game with set collection and area majority mechanisms dipped in a mild sauce of straightforward conflict (resolved without dice!). Try to find the optimal mix of capital buildings, discoveries and colonist majorities in the New Land. Make sure to build up an economy (via trade goods and merchant ships) and to send colonists to the new world (missionaries are extremely handy to take additional trade goods and establish a firm presence). Discoveries are useful for additional cash and victory points. Capital buildings are crucial to get extra cash and specialists at the beginning of the game and for additional victory points at the end of the game. What's not to like? Well, as minor points: there is a bit too much chrome (I would prefer wooden cubes instead of plastic miniatures) and the scoring track is horrible (some of the fields are hidden by redundant art). **** Major concern after our first play: the game might be too unbalanced as some of the capital buildings look very powerful (the randomly determined startplayer can get very lucky with the initial selection - I was rather glad I could grab the trade post in my first play & as another example, having a capital building giving victory points for trade goods might be overkill as these provide already victory points). Other combo's or skillful play through other victory point mechanisms might counterbalance this, but this was not really the case in our first play [five players] with a very clear runaway leader rather early on (very relaxing if you are in the driving seat :-)). **** The second play [four players] resulted in a much more balanced endscore, although again some of the combo's for the capital buildings are really powerful and the chance element of which capital buildings become available might wreck a strategy aimed at certain capital buildings with a high return on victory points. **** The balance in our third play [four players - all had played before] was OK. **** All sessions took about 4 to 5 hours to play.

Somewhat too long and didn't really do anything new, but an alright game.

Just felt like too many standard eruo games mixed together. It also felt too long for hat it had to offer.

Certainly not bad & would play again (and expect it to be faster and less random, ie i would know what buildings to expect) as it may well improve with more plays.

AOE III is an excellent worker placement game. The downside is that most actions can be countered by one or more opponents. 
THat's a strange thing to say.Let me show this by an example. In order to get the ship that counts as a wildcard an opponent can prevent you from getting it. Opposed to other worker placement games where you get the action you placed your worker. This means that the game lends itself to partnerships and i don't like that in workerplacement games.

the two player game plays totally different than the 4 player game. 

In both games I had the missionary and I blew the opposition away. Colonisation is an unmistakenly big key to winning the game.

I really like this game. It is somewhat a mixture of many other games currently on the market (mainly El Grande) yet it is still original enough to be fun. My wife however, wishes there was a tad more luck involved. I appreciate this game for it's strategic nature. My biggest gripe is the box it came in. It was waay to large for the board, and none of the many components came in any kind of organizing container. Also, the box itself was very cheaply made.

Pretty sure this is my brother in law's favourite game. I rate it highly although I prefer other worker placement games if truth be told. I still think it's a great game though and multiple paths to victory is always going to be a winner. However, there is an element of luck involved here. Some of it, namely the discovery tiles, you can choose not to get involved in- if you do participate, it is pretty galling to send 5 soldiers in to claim a 1 native tile before watching your opponent send 2 soldiers in to claim a 2 soldier tile. The other luck element is unavoidable however- the capital buildings in the 3rd round are randomly drawn and can offer up big VP bonuses in the end game. If the strategy/ strategies you took throughout the game are not rewarded by the correct buildings coming out, you're probably in trouble.

I'm not sure why this game hasn't taken off for me.  I originally thought that it would have a lot of replayability, but neither me nor my group has wanted to bring it out after the initial plays.  Different strategies have won each time, but I did not feel the itch to try something different or new, as is the case with some other games I've played.  Maybe when I can put my finger on what keeps this from hitting the table, I'll report back.

[2007.Sep.15] A well-themed, analytical game from the same mold as Caylus and The Pillars of the Earth [TPofE], although slightly closer to TPofE due to presence of a luck element (in the form of Discovery tiles/cards) and a fixed number of game turns (in this case 8 turns). Some minor gripes include: (a) the oversized, insertless game box, (b) the non-German-style game board folds (creases), (c) the strangely shaped New World regions that can become over-crowded with colonists, and (d) a lack of on-board zones for the current turn's active buildings and trade goods (the board definitely has enough space for such). All-in-all minor (component-based) gripes that barely mar a good game.

This thing has the worst, flimsy, overblown box in the history of poorly designed boxes, but it's hell of a game.  Nice worker placement combined with an area control aspect, possibility for some wargaminess, multiple viable paths to victory, relatively simple rules despite deep gameplay, good flow, very little AP, etc.  The theme works and is well integrated and the game is just very pleasant with to play, with lots happening to keep everyone interested.  It can suffer from a bit of bash the leader, which can be bad since real scores are often somewhat obfuscated.

A very good Euro game.  The ability to structure your efforts towards a variety of different long term strategies (which seem to be equally potent), recalls Puerto Rico.

An in-depth worker placement game that takes a bit of a different turn from others in its class.  Instead of collecting rocks and wood and food, you're placing your colonists, merchants, missionaries, soldiers and captains to create new workers of those types, buy buildings, earn income and sail off to new lands.  The first round (of eight) had me a bit confused.  By round two I was good to go and enjoyed the game thoroughly.  Even with a fourth place finish (out of four people), I can honestly say this game was a lot of fun once you get your bearings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I was surprised when one of my friends bought this one and asked me to read the rules to play it some time later. It is quite entertaining and the pieces are beautiful.

The fightning seems useless at first, but after the first game was won because of *one* fight (by 2 points!), the whole mechanics made sense and the strategic deepness became evident. 

This is how Pillars of the Earth should be.

Trust me, I'm not a big fan of miniatures in this kind of game, in fact I would play this with meeples and it would still be a fulfilling experience, but still the miniatures add that something else.

RATING: 9
After the success of [GAMEID=31260], we were looking for another heavier worker placement game.  It probably isn't as hard as [GAMEID=31260] to pick up, since there's fewer possible actions and they're mostly the same each round, although there are more specialized workers to place.  There also seems like quite a few paths towards victory, either going for discovery, colonization, resources and buildings, or even military.

However, the game seemed to lack a little something with just two players.  It feels like it's missing that "tenseness" and "turn angst" that [GAMEID=31260] had.  The gameplay also feels a little too wide open---there doesn't feel like a lot of interaction between the players and it's easy to go ahead with your strategy.  It's easy to acquire a lot of workers to place, so usually you're able to do what you need.  The colonization space is the only one that's dramatically limited in the two player game with only three available spots.  With the limited colonization opportunities, it's harder to steal a colony from under someone's nose and the military path seems limited as well, since you just can't get enough soldiers into the New World.  With only two players, you also miss out on the possibility of shifting alliances between different players.  

Also, I have to admit that I prefer wooden components over the plastic components here.  We mistook what each piece was far too often...

Update:  we tried this with three players and the game felt completely different.  However, it made us appreciate the differences from the two-player game---the competition switches to different actions.  With more players, it's a lot more difficult to get resources and extra specialists while the colonization actions are much tighter with two.  We've gone back to play with two and found it more fun now.  Maybe it's because we're more familiar with the game now, but while at first it felt like an open game of abundance, it's actually a very tight game and you have to choose the best actions at the best times carefully.  Recommended with two.

A very robust system which allows the game to play smoothly, a logical narrative, clear signposting of the cause and effect of actions,  several paths to victory, excellent components and a "snowball" point scoring system (1st round only a small number of victory points are available compared to the later rounds when the snowball has gained momentum rolling down the hill) which allow you to feel yourself into the game and are not consigned to failure if you make a wrong decision in the early round.

An excellent game, with high replay value, which because of the positives listed above I would have no hesitation to introducing to newbies or gamer alike.

Another one of those Ameritrashy production value games, that really is a Euro at heart. There seems to be many different viable tactics, so replay value should be good.

Absolutely loved this one. First part feels a lot like Caylus with placing your guys and following map order for resolution of the placement.

- downtime between rounds
- not much direct player interaction
- territories are a little small .. not all workers fit in a territory
- if you don't have money in the third age the number of your decisions are limited.
- territory domination counts less then the other in the final victory

It was described to me as a bit like Dominant Species, and I can see the similarities: worker placement on the right, all actions are resolved in order and apply to the map on the left, lots of player interaction.

RATING: 8
Played with 4 and with 2. This is a very good game. Lots of thing to track, different paths to victory. It's important to balance money (to get those damn building) and colonist (to get pts). I like the Discovery mecanism but I think it is very easy to get screwed in pts (sacrifying lots of colonists for a cheap discovery). Maybe this would be better with open discovery tile?

The only strange thing is Warfare. With 2 players it seems to be a very good strategy to battle your opponent as often as possible (especially if you have soldier advantage). It's easy to do because usually you have a lot of money to spend. With 4 players though... this is seldom used. Money is so tight that you don't want to sacrifice buying a building to go to war.

All in all, a good game with a nice theme that doesn't feel pasted on!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is by far the best design to come out of the "Drover" line.

The board is a bit too large, but then again, presentation does make this game stand out.

Fantastic bits, wonderfully clear rules (they give a brief overview then a detailed description, and even have an advanced variant for starting position), and a collection of familiar mechanics masterfully blended into what makes a fantastic game.

So many avenues to victory, and a wealth of synergy makes this one almost a 10...but more plays will prove that.

Update:

This one settles at a solid 7. In time other designs have appeared which do similar things either better or in a shorter play time. This game still does some unique things on it's own and the worker placement style is still not totally usurped. It certainly retains it's spot in my collection.

I really like this game and will play it almost any chance I get as it is a lighter version of Dominant Species.  You place different types of workers to acquire various resources like money, other workers, ships to make sets of goods, goods to give you more money and buildings.  You place all your workers out and resolve in the order they were placed from top to bottom.  You score through area control on a map where you have the most colonists an soldiers.  You can also scope by discovering new colonies for settlement.  The mechanics are nicely balanced and the expansion is fun.  The only minor problem was that certain versions of the game and a poor score track and the miniatures looked similar but there are nice files on the geek to help make this easier to play.  

Not really a family game, but easy to teach.  I will almost always play this game if suggested.

Only takes about an hour with 1 player. May very well be worth pulling off the shelves more often and "forcing" students to play. :)

While the game is good on its own merits, it probably is worth playing Caylus first.

Not really a gateway game. Less accessible that Ticket to Ride, but more accessible than Power Grid.

One of the original worker placement games. One of the most thematic worker placement games.

Very nice game - Euro mechanics and American figures and theme. It's a board game version of the popular RTS focused on building, not warfare. Rating could go up, initial concerns are game length, harsh nature of area majority scoring and new world warfare. On the plus side, game feels like you're actually building up an empire, and there do seem several viable strategies to win.

Somewhat thematic game of exploring and colonizing the Americas. Some luck involved, but not overly so. The actions to choose are quite obvious most of the time, which doesn't help making the game more interesting.

The core of a euro game, yet it is lacking in several aspects: annoying random rewards when exploring, unbalanced buildings, random scoring boosts (if the building granting points for whatever you've ammassed comes out in Age III or not), runaway leader problem, some clunky rules (e.g. initiative).

- (too) balanced game ; difficult to say in advance who is in the lead, even not in the last round ! Nobody is never locked out of the game. This gives always a positive social athmosphere on the gaming table.
-perfect and clear game system without exceptions ; easy to explain to non gamers
-perfect tension ; good fine tuning of interaction. You cannot win with only aggressive military play. 
- good game duration ; 30 min/  player 

-
exploration system is a bit luck driven, but you can easy avoid it ; you simply send 5 soldiers to the undiscovered colonies.
You have not a perfect control of the apparition of the buildings, so it's difficult to follow a single long term plan, but in practise this consideration is not so important, you simply take what the game gives. These negative things are only small issues. 

It's a relatively short but very enjoyable game.

I truly enjoy this game.  The strategies are complex and varied, with far more than one way to win.  The components are nice (though I am not big on plastic normally), and add to the theme nicely.  A bit cutthroat, with direct conflict.

Description:  This game was compared to five different games by the five different players at the table.  Suffice it to say that many mechanics are at work:  resource management that feels at times like bidding, at times like wargaming, at times like area control.  There are many paths to victory (bringing the inevitable comparisons to PR) but less importance in seating position because of the initative track.  I felt like it was everything I like about Princes of Florence with the distasteful stuff distilled out.  Not quite as good as El Grande, but maybe I need more plays before I can rightfully compare it to one of my favorites.

Negative:  we had one gamer who is particularly prone to AP.  Everyone has a different theory about WHY he is AP'ed, but the fact remains that he singlehandedly added about 90 minutes to the playtime of this game.  And most of it was in the placement from the colonists ship in turns 6 and 8.  One of the other players actually left before the scoring - he was "fed up", and even though I enjoyed the game (and a victory!) I was fed up as well.  Sadly, I think I will have to avoid playing with the AP'er (even though I enjoy plenty of other games with him) when it comes to this one.

UPDATE:  Four players was an even better experience.  The game moved, but remained quite tense and three players had a chance at the end.  This may be on its way to a 10 rating.

I can't imagine having fun with 6 players playing this.

UPDATE:  We played a five player game, but all players had at least one game experience.  Also, we had made a gentlemanly agreement to take our turns more expeditiously.  We finished the game in less than 2 hours.  It was quite fun and tense... I'd built a strong early lead with heavy population in the New World.  However, Jay played a strong financial strategy and built a large bankroll. He was able to acquire lots of capital buildings in the last turns and pull to a tie.  I missed two discoveries in turn 7 and 8... had I just waited to have six explorers, instead of taking two chances with four, the VP's would have made a hugh difference.  Also, Jay had a couple soldiers and was able to influence another player's options for warfare simply by intimidation... I had no soldiers on the board.  Final score?  Jay 94, Mac 93 with the other players scoring 79 or less.  The agony!!!

UPDATE: Another 5 player game. Again, we got done in less than 2 hours. Perhaps I'm paranoid, but it seemed three players looked for conflict with me in the first age. I couldn't wreak vengeance on them all, so I focused on the player who hurt me the most by taking away a set of trade goods and a colony from me. The "vengeance" strategy (as many soldiers as possible) actually worked pretty good, incidentally. I ended up in second... again losing to Jay. Jay 95, Mac and xLx 86.

UPDATE:  Five player.  Again, I went with an aggressive soldier strategy.  I was able to pay expenses with Incan Gold, an early set of tobacco, 4 and 5 in initiative, and an early Merchant.  I got my soldier from training, until the Age II soldier capital building.  By the end of Age II I secured 26 points of colonies, and no one was interested in challenging... I had one or two soldiers in each!  Indian Allies and the migrating soldier buildings help me add muscle.  Although I didn't get the Power building, I was able to hold my 26 points of colonies and add 13 economy, 8 discovery (with two soldier expeditions!!) and 11 capital building points.  Final score Mac 90, Jay 86, Boaz 79.

UPDATE:  AoE III... you deserve it.  10!!!

UPDATE - GAME SIX:  Four player game, and I again went with the soldier strategy.  I got hugely lucky with my discoveries (needed/sent) - 4/4, 3/3, 5/4 and 6 VP discovery with New World Cartograpgy.  I got 14, 20, and 26 VP's from colonies in the scoring rounds, and got "Glory" with 10 soldiers on the board.  Notably, the other players started taking away my opportunities to obtain soldies in round 4, but I already had 6 on the board at that point.  Final score: Mac 117, Yoel 107.

UPDATE:  Game SEVEN, 5 players.  I get the soldier capitol building early, then focus on the New World, trade goods, and ships.  I pick up three ships on the cheap, and end with 3x4 sets and 1x3 set (I drew some lucky tiles with West Indies).  I get 4 discoveries, 3 were gambles on tiles with 3 discoverers (1,2,2 natives defending).  My final tally is balance with 21 VPs economy, 18 discoveries, 21 capital buildings, and 2,16,20 from colonies.  Mac 98, Boaz 87.

UPDATE:  5 players.  The luckiest game I ever played.  I had 6 trade goods, 2 sets of three with 2 ships.  I had 8 Soldiers in the new world, and stayed away from the only other player with Soldiers.  I got Incan Gold early, and had 5 solid buildings in the first Age.  I maintained a cash flow in the middle with some trained Merchants.  I got lucky on the Age Three buildings, good for 27 VP.  In the end, I tallied 111, Jay 87, Larry 73.

RATING: 8
Well-themed, with a good overall narrative arc and lots of opportunities for big and little strategies. After the one play, it appears to be very well balanced - knowing more about the capital building that give VPs would even have increased the strategic appeal.

There are, however, some rough edges, which mostly resolve around scoring rounds: when landing colonists, the information available (i.e. who else will land colonists, warfare, ...) is fixed, so that it is possible to calculate VP outcomes, but the decision tree has enough branches to make this last a while. With the right players (or a timer), this should not cause much fuzz, but it is a well-paved way into analysis paralysis. And I'm not particularly fond of the boom-or-bust approach to expeditions, either.

That said, the game certainly is good, good enough that I'd very much like to play again.

I truly suck at this game. I get off in the timing of which items to prioritize. I get into "pissing matches" that I end up losing—wasting precious resources. I really admire the game design and it does a great job of simulating the colonization of the New World. My brain is just not wired for it, I guess.

Some of the random aspects (discoveries, for example) seem to be too influential in determining the outcome.

I've played this three times now and liked it a little better each time.  That said, it still hasn't totally grabbed me.  It's like a blend of El Grande (area control) and Pillars of the Earth (pawn placement--not sure what this is really called, but you put your little dudes on a certain part of the board to acquire certain items, privileges, or actions that are doled out in area-order then dude-order).  You have to pick a strategy and let some options fall by the wayside, there are more ways to spend your dudes/money than you really need to utilize to make points; spreading yourself too thin by trying to do a little of everything is not the best way to go.  Played with four players twice and it flowed well until the last turn, when the area-control gets really hairy in anticipation of the final scoring.  Played once with six and the whole game dragged horribly, WAY too much down time.  I think the game does lend itself to AP with so many choices to be made on every turn.

One of my favorites.

AOE III has nothing to do with the computer game other than it is about colonizing the new world...so be forewarned.

What it is though is a great worker placement game with tons of strategy and depth. The rules aren't that heavy and I have had an easy time teaching it to my group. The flow is great as it keeps everyone engaged the entire game. The components are great (save for the flimsy feeling box) and look the part (the coins sound nice clinking together).

Just all around a great package with lots of fun. I don't have a single gripe about this game.

This is a big, beautiful and somewhat complex game. There are 100's of plastic pieces plus a lot of pretty tiles and cards. Takes at least a couple of hours, but it is absorbing, and intuitive and smooth. There's a lot to think about too. Highly recommended. Includes the Plague Expansion.

As much as I want to like it--exploration of the New World is favorite theme of mine--this game lets me down. All of the individual parts work, even make some thematic sense. But just because you can turn the game's crank and something happens doesn't mean it works *well*. It's way too long, the overproduced bits are hard to distinguish, and I'm not sure about the power and swing of all those capital buildings. I'm a big fan of the "less is more" type of game design, and this seems to be the other type, "more is more."

On my 2nd play, I almost got to finish the game.  I feel that it is about 30 minutes too long for what it is.  Basically, the game is Caylus with chrome and some randomness thrown in. And the chrome (namely the plastic minis) just adds length to the game as you constantly have to shuffle them around and they can be hard to distinguish. The other issue is that of turn order/placement. The game can get bogged down (especially with 5 players) because players don't go in clockwise order and each player can only place 1 colonist at a time.  Therefore,  you will lose valuable time constantly trying to figure out whose turn it is.  Also, the money tokens, while they look nice, don't stack very well.

Game play wise, it is a solid game, but offers nothing really new in the genre.  Is it different enough to stand out?  Maybe, but the length is an issue with 5+ players and I don't think the tension will hold up with fewer.

I can see why this is a classic. There's so much to do, the tension is palpable, the bits are ridiculously overproduced and gorgeous, the art is great, and the overall experience is simply fantastic. I love the weight of the game. There's certainly a lot going on, and while it's by no means a "heavy" game, it's also far from light. It's a true medium weight game with many paths to victory. Like Endeavor, it has that "epic" feel to it. Speaking of Endeavor, a similarly themed game, I like both rather equally. Endeavor is lighter, I think and certainly quicker. AOE is better produced and possibly more cutthroat. It's also on par, in terms of rating, with Francis Drake. To be honest, I was on the fence whether this game was a 8.5 or a 9. The deciding factor was playing count. Against the advice of most users, I played this with only 2 the first time (my wife and I). It played awesome with 2! I'm sure it would be more tense and cutthroat with more, but with no variants whatsoever, the tension in a 2-player game can be easily cut with a knife. I love this game!

Update 2/8/15:

Played with 3 last night (Erin, Tyson and me). It was definitely better with 3 than with 2. It didn't seem like the board was that much "tighter" (credit to the 2-player experience), however, the warfare played a much greater role. After playing another game of this, I've seen some things I love and some things that I didn't particularly care for. 

Things I love:

-Art: beautiful colors and old world feel
-Components: love the minis, particularly the ships and the coins are quite nice
-Gameplay: The board makes the game feel epic! Also, even though you are sometimes placing 10 or more "workers" out on the board, your actions still seem scarce and important. This scarcity drives up the tension quite a bit. 
-Rounds: Being a Type A personality, I prefer having a set number of rounds in a game, and AOE does not disappoint. 
-Rules: They're not much to look at, but they are formatted approximately with a nice index. 

Things I didn't like: 

-The box. It's really bad. I have it sitting at the top of the stack to prevent dishing, but it's super thin cardboard and certainly not linen-finished. 
-The tiles: I'm not a fan of the art on the tiles. It's really blah. Also, I know it's a little difficult to put the entire action of each tile on a small counter, but looking the tiles up in the index constantly slows down gameplay in a game that is by no means short. 
-"Runaway leaderish": I wouldn't say that this game has a runaway leader problem, but it's close. I can say that it's unforgiving, particularly if you get left behind in exploration early on. Because of how the scoring works, it's a little difficult to make up lost ground. In a game of this length, you don't want it to be apparent that you have no way to win several rounds out. 

All in all, this game is truly great. For now, I'm going to keep it at a 9. Despite how much I like it, I cannot ignore the few problems I have with it. Nevertheless, this one will be in my collection for a long time.

I've only played this once so far. It was ok but there was something missing. I assumed that this would be an empire building game and it isn't. The discovery aspect of the game wasn't satisfying for some reason. 

This game is basically a bidding game. You take your men and place them on one side of the board to try and get the resources you need. That's really the whole game. Everyone places their men in various boxes until they run out and then you find out who gets what. That's 99% of the game. It just felt dry.

I never count a game out after playing it once. I would like to play this again now that I have a better feel for it. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this type of game when I played it. Or perhaps I expected this game to be something that it wasn't which led to a little disappointment.

Played 5-10 times, 1st edition. I´m very happy with this purchase. Considerably longer than most other games we play, but it´s worth it. Player turns usually move pretty quickly, it´s just the total playing time that adds up. Unless you play with AP-people, of course. They can really ruin this one. The one drawback I see is that it´s hard to see how everyone is doing, but on the other hand, that reduces the leader-bashing. Oh, and the game board is one of the worst in terms of usability.

Far better than I expected. It's a less nasty than a lot of worker placement games. In other worker-placement games (ie Caylus) only the first to place in a spot gets the action so it can be frustrating when someone else grabs a key spot for your strategy. Other such games (ie Leonarda da Vinci) give the action to whoever puts the most workers there - this can be even more annoying because some of your workers inevitably end up getting you nothing. For the most part this is not how worker placement in AoE works, so it's a more forgiving example of the genre.

RATING: N/A
Cool components and interesting theme, but I just don't like the worker placement on the side of the board.  It doesn't feel intuitive, or that the theme matches the mechanics.  It's a little too abstract for a game that looks like it will be very thematic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game overall has a lot of good things going for it
econmic engine
area control
limited warfare
varied strategies available
scales well
nice components

but it has 3 main detractors as well
Game length
Cost
turn optimization vs long term strategy

It's really way too long for what you get out of it.
Cost sounds nitpicky, but I could get 2 games for this price (and play both in the same time)
Because of some of the randomness (especially buildings and trade goods), strategy suffers vs tactical. 

Good stuff, just falls a little flat for me, especially relative to the hype.

A neat eurogame. The mechanics are interesting, with the usual perks of this type of game (multiple strategies, fixed lenght, no player elimination, lots of decisions). However it is in a sort of "complexity limbo", I prefer either bare-bones economic engines (like Saint Petersburg) or games that seems more complex (like Caylus and Puerto Rico)

A lot of interesting choices are available in this game. The mechanism of allocate resources here to get this to put it there to get that is interesting in the same way that the mechanics of Caylus are interesting to me.  Small production and layout issues (such as it being easy to get colonists in different provinces mixed up, a horrible scoring track that we eschew for paper and pen, and the difficult to distinguish playing pieces) make this game less fun that it could be. All things being equal I'd rather play Caylus. However, I have not played this game enough yet and it remains interesting to me.

RATING: 4
Fun game.  Very well done, especially considering most games based off of a movie or a video game end up somewhat pathetic.

Age III has somewhat of a Caylus feel to it, but still keeps enough of the theme to feel like Age of Empires.

I play taking account of some house rules that improves balance and playability. FOR ISTANCE, the role of the navies (caravelle) is manifold: more points at the end of the game (1 for one navy, 3 for two navies, 6 for three navies and 10 for four navies owned).
Ho modificato la mappa del Nord America aggiungendo un territorio in più; i "Territori dell'Ovest", che si possono raggiungere e colonizzare SOLO DOPO aver fondato almeno una colonie confinanti dall'Est; inoltre questo territorio ha un "+1 indigeni" quando si tenta la scoperta.
Inoltre, pur non possedendo l'espansione, ho alcune delle tessere promo edifici capitali scaricati dal web che si adattano al gioco anche senza l'espansione, per l'appunto.

08/31/09 I finally got the second edition, that I think came out in July 2008. 

09/26/09 Played a three-player game. It went well and we all enjoyed it. It took less time (two hours) than I assumed; good. I look forward to playing it with more players. But I'm glad it turned out to work very well with three, many games don't. My only quibble with the production of the game is the merchants are too easily mistaken for colonists. Oh, and the boardgame has absolutely nothing to do with the computer game, except the artwork on the box cover. So I'm mystified why they bothered to buy the rights to use the name. 
11/21/09 Played a four-player game and realized the provinces are really a bit small once four players start loading them with colonists. Maybe some of that useless ocean space in the middle of the board could have been used to enlarge the New World.
05/01/10 Another three-player game. 
06/26/10 Another four-player game. I still look forward to trying it with five.  
05/05/11 The game's name and BGG entry is now changed from Age of Empires III: The Age of Discovery to Glenn Drover's Empire: Age of Discovery, to get around licensing issues. A new print run with the new name with follow by year end. 
05/07/11 Finally, a five-player game. 
05/25/13 Another five-player game.

My favourite Boardgame - it has all, which a perfect game needs.

Wow, congratulations Glenn for this masterpiece!

RATING: 6
Age of Empires III is an odd mixture of Caylus and Struggle of Empires. Unfortunately AoE III is not as good as these great great games. This main problem is surprisingly dull action when colonists are placed. Also going through the resolving of colonists and especially end-of-turn actions were far from smooth. But the production values were top notch and of course this is not a bad game. Of similar games, Vikings: Fire&Axe is IMHO better  and of course heavier masterpiece Struggle of Empires is perhaps the greatest game ever. UPDATE: Rating dropped to '6'. Just not for me...

Rating based on a couple of plays with 4 and 5 players.  I enjoyed this game a lot.

There are lots of different things to do that leaves it very open.  And it's beautiful looking.  I would gladly whenever I have the time, the key thing being time - it plays a little long for my taste, but it's fun.

RATING: 5
A game about standing in lines. First you stand in a line to see who gets to choose which line they want to stand in first, then you choose among different lines that will eventually let you do exciting things like discover a confined space (where you can later stand and get points), or buy buildings (which give you more people, meaning more opportunities to stand in more lines). Just make your selection and wait for your selection to arrive or be delayed, and then find another line to stand in.

Edit: played again with 4 (rather than 5), and it's more bearable. Raised rating from a 2.

This game plays great with 3, 4, or 5 players.  Each has its own flavor.  You have to get 1st place in some of the colonies, but you cannot make dominating colonies your only strategy.

You have to adapt to the conditions on the board.  If a key trade good suddenly comes out, it becomes your number one priority.  Making sure you have enough money to buy a coveted capital building is also important.  Jumping up in the turn order at just the right time so you get first crack at the available buildings is also a great move.

This game has lots of dynamics and strategies.  I highly recommend it.

It's not that bad of a game, and I'd play it now and then. Well, once a year, maybe, if there was nothing else available. Combat is too abstract for my tastes, and rules like "only one person per turn can buy a soldier/merchant/captain/missionary on a given turn"  don't make a lot of sense except as a typically Euroish balancing mechanism.  And it's just this sort of bizarre restriction that prevents Euros from being immersive. Eurogameland is the only land on Earth where there's only one ship captain for hire in the entire world.
I have some other minor issues (the territories are too small, for example), but overall it's a decent effort. The rules are simple enough to grasp during a first play (though not necessarily the long-term strategies).

This is right on the cusp of being a 5, very close. It would be for sure if it was shorter or if the combat was better or if it didn't have so much of that artificial Euro-ness to its mechanism. Eh, on second thought, it's not really that close to being a 5. Too long, too Euro, too much of all the things that make me shake my head in frustration at the design choices that detract from the immersive experience that I prefer.

Juego que combina colocación de trabajadores con mayorías.
Lo mejor del juego es la gran variedad de caminos que tiene hacia la victoria. Aunque hay algunos mas óptimos que otros. Preferiblemente se tiene que jugar con mas de 3 jugadores,ya que mete un puntito mas de conflicto entre las acciones a realizar. Como punto negativo le puedo poner que algunas losetas de desarrollo pueden desequilibran mucho el juego. Con todo, un buen juego por encima de la media.

Way too simple a game for me.  It really is a game that should have been produced to fit a Warfrog-size box, leaving out the silly plastic figures which look too much alike anyway.  Another game in the Puerto Rico mold, choosing actions, performing actions, none of which remotely remind me of actual exploration.  Interesting we discovered the Maya before mainland Mexico was even uncovered!  Conquistador/Viceroys both handle the subject much more interestingly.  The map was also hard to look at.

RATING: 6
Kind of in-between Caylus and Pillars of the Earth, with the same basic main action selection system.
Pros: Very themeful, some tense decisions, several different strategies available for the win. I really liked the "combat" system and the integration of some sort of an area-control mini-game. 
Cons: Lots of randomness in the buildings; this can be especially frustrating in round 3 if the building you really were counting on for the win doesn't show up. Easily remedied through a simple house rule. Biggest problem however is that the game has very little game arc; the types of decisions to be taken change very little from round to round, making the game feel very static and kind of repetitive after round 3-4 (out of 8). This is the same problem that plagues Pillars of the Earth, and (to a much lesser extent) Caylus.

RATING: 6
I seem to have been playing a lot of games lately consisting of cobbled together euro mechanics.  This is no exception.  AoE III is a worker placement game where players user their workers for next-turn order, discovery voyages (for VPs, etc. but at a potential risk if you don't send enough workers), colonization (a mini area-control game), warfare (basically removing people from the colonies), goods (set collection for income), upgrading workers (powers), and buying buildings (Puerto Rico light).  

It all works well and has a theme that's easy for most people to relate too.  Some will find issue with the luck found in the discoveries (number of VPs, etc.), and tile draws for goods & buildings.   There's a huge issue with the first turn in that the first player can choose actions before anyone else and it's probably going to be to buy the best building.  Each subsequent player gets a pittance of one dollar per turn position after first.  Course that first player will then get the first pick of the second actions, etc. too.

I found the actions too derivative and the buildings to be somewhat uninteresting to rate this higher than a 7.  Additionally the aesthetics of the game really turn my stomach.

some good stuff and the pacing/endgame is handled better than some other games in the worker placement genre.  a solid 7 (maybe a tad higher) with 3 players.  i think the game would more interesting with certainly 4 players, and maybe 5.  with 3, the game feels a bit too loose and potentially more susceptible to building/trade combos.

4 players is a nice fit.  5 is a bit too many.  3 player game prevents some strategies from being feasible.

This is nothing like the PC-game. It's an easy to teach game that can get really tensed. Enough different strategies to score points and because you always depend on what others do, no two games will be the same.

Hard to find any flaws. Maybe it's easy to forget if you did your actions/took your points and that can lead to discussion. But that's more like a human error than a flaw of the game.

Is there a chance for a long term strategy in this game? I think the answer to both questions is "No".
I love the theme, but I don´t like the game so much, that I´ll keep it. And for this price I think a cheap inlay would have been a great idea.

This is my poster child for games where the components actively get in the way of playing the game.  The little plastic minis are oversized for the smaller regions of the board, they are impossible to tell apart when crowded together, they tend to fall over when jostled, and they just don't add anything.  

I assume that this game was not playtested in final production form.

Replace the plastic minis with wooden bits, redraw the map to replace some of the decorative chrome with colony regions that are actually large enough for a reasonable number of playing pieces (with visible boundaries), and (possibly) slightly re-balance the power of the buildings, and you'd have a cool game here.

A game that mixes area-control with economic engine development, this is one that I like.  It can take a while, but it's got a lot of meat and while it has combat, the combat is very predictable and limited in scope.  

Very nice.

[Update: Initial turn order might play a bit too important of a role; in the last game I played the "get one merchant every turn" came up in the very first round; this gave the first player a tremendous advantage in cash the entire game (7 free merchants, meaning 35 gold), which the player used well to trounce everyone else (including buying additional money-earning buildings when others couldn't afford them).  Not sure if getting an extra gold or two makes up for the possibility of being so far behind right from the start].

A really good game requiring a good deal of thought and planning to play effectively.

Picked up at B&N for 75% off on a whim - box lid was massively crushed.

First play, 4/18/09. Although this game shares mechanics with games like Pillars of the Earth, Stone Age, Agricola, and Caylus, this is the black-bearded half-uncle who disciplines you with an Iron Fist. Finally a euro-style worker placement game with bite! You can actually take WARFARE actions in this game. 

And indeed, in comparison to other games where there is military conflict, the conflict here is light, the key here is that there still IS conflict. LOTS of conflict. To clarify - the "conflict" in other worker placement games tends to be based on taking a valuable space before someone else has a chance. As such, it really does feel like, to use the cliche, multi-player solitaire. If you are careful, you can win games like that while completely ignoring the other players, simply by building the most efficient path to victory (and I've done it in Pillars of the Earth, Stone Age, and Agricola, so I know it's possible.) In AOEIII, however, the majority of the VP stand to be gained at the end of each age for majority control of colonies. The game actually encourages DIRECT conflict on top of the indirect conflict worker placement layer in that, one of the actions players can take is to ship soldiers and colonists to other players colonies, and later take WARFARE actions to fight for supremacy in those colonies. So right at the end of each age, there is a knife fight smack down fight for those VP's. For once, you can screw up someone else's VP gain DIRECTLY, instead of just taking actions that cut them off. 

Truly one of the better worker placement games out there.

TRADE INFO: First edition - Age of Empires III box, with smaller scoring track.
Bought this from the ding and dent table at B&N a while ago. Box has caving and a crushed corner. Contents in great condition - everything is sorted into plano boxes which I will include.

A good mixture of many old mechanics, all blend quite while together.  Very good component, with the exception of the box durability and size.  This is an initial rating after one play and rating may still go up.

Really enjoy this game.  It has a lot of what I love in a game.  Worker placement.  A little area control.  Set collection.  Some exploration.  Many paths to victory.  A good little mix.  I will probably pick it up at some point, it's just that with Stone Age and Agricola I already have a couple worker placements, but this really has a lot of other things going on.

I thought this game was going to be everything I always hoped for.  Good theme, beautiful production, and sleek rules.  It does all those things, but forgets to have depth.  Every game after the second was the same game.  No emerging strategies.  No clever plays.  It's hollow on the inside.

Definitely overrated. Decent production quality, but otherwise it's just your staple euro-style economic gameplay of worker placement and acquisition of goods in order to score victory point combos. Yawn... Not a bad game, but not exactly my cup of tea. Maybe I'll change my mind after a few more plays, but I don't think it'll improve much.

An amazing worker placement game that includes area majority, economic development and some slight direct player conflict. This game is getting a reprint sometime in 2015 (hopefully).

My favorite game. Very few luck elements make this an outstanding resource management game. With a base of 5 colonists a turn, you need to decide how best to expand your empire - through trade, discovery, or colonization. There's never enough colonists to do all that you want and add to that your opponents are limiting your options with every placement of their colonists, it makes for a very enjoyable multi-player game.

Lots of recent games have the "place your workers to gather resources and score points" mechanic.  I am thinking of Caylus, Pillars of the Earth, Leonardo da Vinci, and Notre Dame.  AoE III uses this mechanic as well as any of them. The little miniatures really help sell the theme.  My son complained that this game has nothing to do with the computer game but that didn't bother me a bit.  Even though conflict is minimal the race to fill the best spots provides plenty of player interaction.

A lighter blend of a combination of Dominant Species action placement; El Grande area control; and, I don't know, those little plastic army men you played with as a kid.  Surprised it was nominated for artwork award, given that the color scheme is not pleasant and the artwork is loud.  

Well, that's the negative.  Positive is that the play is relatively smooth, though, unlike Dominant Species, with this game I feel like sometimes remaining actions to be selected did not influence the game greatly.  I could go into more detail to explain that poorly worded sentence but not worth it.  You could make the case that this is a moderate strategy game.

This was my first foray into worker-placement games, and I really enjoyed the agonizing decisions of where to go and when. I like the theme of exploring the new world, the many  different strategies to follow, and you have to constantly keep an eye on what the other players are doing. Money and resources are tight in the first rounds, and decisions can not be taken easily.
Works well with 4 and 5 players. And it looks good, too.
Unfortunately I don't  get to play it as often as I'd like.

UPDATE 2: Five seems to be the sweet spot for this game.  Rating went up half a point.  Really starting to love it. UPDATE:  Just had a very fun 5-player game.  Some lasting, niggling rules questions (after reading through the FAQ), which is silly at this point.  However, it's a very solid game and I like it more each time I play.===================Not.  Bad.  At.  All!  Rating very likely to rise.Just played a 4-player version of this tonight, and AoE3 is at once a Caylus-killer.  Who wants to go back to the colorless, drab world of Caylus when they can play the much more richly themed AoE3? This takes back the word Euro from those who make Euro games a clinical exercise of arithmetic, mentat-mindedness, and cold calculation, none of which I'm good at.  There are agonizing choices, but FUN agonizing choices, and the whole game makes sense.Now I'm sure there are the usual rules niggles, questions, and errata, but I'd like to play this again, maybe with 5.  If the game doesn't break down somewhere, my rating is very likely to rise.  I love the computer RTS upon which this was based, but the boardgame has given that one a run for its money.  I look forward to playing again soon.

Bears no semblance to the computer game, much more like older Colonisation  (PC)game. That said marvelluous fun for 4-6 players with a number of routes to victory. Parts are good especially the cash... but it does look abit like crisps close up ( thats chips for you Americans).Takes about 3 hours to play. Therefore I give it an 8.

This game hasn't stood up too well. The different types of workers are interesting, but all the different things going at once with the area control and getting buildings and getting trade good sets and exploring and getting money is dang hard to teach. Caylus is much cleaner, heck even Tzolkin or Agricola. The random variation in explore points is also dumb, but that can be fixed by keeping the point spread the same and only playing with the strength of territories.

It was one of the first games I played starting the hobby 10 years ago so I have fond memories playing it. 

I place this as average.

We couldn't figure out the rules for this game. I had 3 different people (who have read countless other game rulebooks) and none of us could figure out how to play. We attempted based on what we understood... but this game just seems so much worse than the vast majority of other games out there.

I'm very confused on why this game is rated so highly.

 - Great Theme & Theme Integration

Nice Caylus-ish game of exploration and colonizing. One problem is it's hard to see a decent warfare strategy get used. Looks like you need at least 5 players or maybe 6 to really force the issue.

A very simple 4X game that even gateway players can understand. The game play is structured, elegant, and mildly interesting. While individual decisions can be made fast, the game as a whole takes a bit too much time consider its simplicity. It feels a bit repetitive towards the end. Also, I feel that the game is not completed, particularly the captial buildings. They aren't very balance and feels samey.

Still, it's a very good introduction to all of the deeper 4X game.

RATING: 8
Blind playtested four times with my play group and we are completely impressed with this game!!  I've played the computer game and there are similarities in the theme but game mechanics make this a 100% EuroGame (not even a wargame). 

Now that the final production version is out, I am rating it a 9.  This game does have, interestingly, bits and pieces of Puerto Rico (trade goods include Indigo, Sugar, Tobacco and Coffee (but there are 7-8 more type of goods as well), Caylus (places pieces one at a time in multiple action boxes in turn order) and Struggle of Empires (area control on a map with points for first and second) built in, but I would argue this game is somewhat of a mish-mash of mechanics as a result.

The game also has discovery, colonists, specialists (missionaries, captains, soldiers and merchants).  The game design is elegant and I think it will stand the test of time.

Very challenging to win and good for 2-5 players.  I like it as a solid 3-4P game, so far.  Even more involved and challenging as conflict and discovery increases with 5 players.  Won my first 5P game last night by one point and what a game!!  

With time we play less and less and I rarely choose it anymore so downgrading to an 8 as it is still a solid game

This was my favorite game the latter half of my childhood. I love the art and the miniatures. The play style is intuitive and satisfying and all the mechanics make sense and are easy to grasp. It is a strategic game, but not critically strategic. 
There are a couple things that bother me. I wish combat was more of a necessity. You can really go a whole game without combat, which sort of makes soldiers useless as well as a couple capital buildings. Also, the merchants and captains are much stronger than the missionaries and soldiers. The missionaries only give you an extra person through the colonist dock. I think their power should also work if they survive a discovery. And soldiers are even more useless. In general, I like the right side of the board where you place all your peeps in trade goods cap buildings etc, but the left side of the board where you colonize the new world is a little underwhelming. It would be cool if you could move your people once a turn or something.Your people just arrive there and stay there for the rest of the game, that feels weird. A good and bad for me is that the winning strategy for this game really comes down to Age 3 capital buildings. 
Anyways, I still love this game. I have gotten new gamers to enjoy this game, but usually I need to play this with people who are up for a big board game. It takes at least 2 hours to play and takes significantly longer with new folks.

In this worker placement game of New World discovery, each player gets five colonists per round. You use them to get ahead in turn order, build, get trade goods for income, get specialized colonists like soldiers or merhcants, move them on a size limited boat to the colonies and conduct war. 

This is a very engaging game with lots of strategy. It is fresh, and very fun to play. Game length is around 3 hours. This game works quite well for 6 players as well. 

I like it since it is full of tension. You don't know if a player with soldiers is going to pay a visit to your colonists, and you don't want to be too far behind in turn order. There are a lot of things to think about.

There is one action where you do a discovery, sending colonists to conquer a colony. You have to defeat natives, which vary from strength 2-5, then later the cards vary from 2-6. There is a huge variance in the strength and VPs. One game, I did try to make this my whole strategy, which doesn't work. The variance of the tiles/cards might turn some people off, but you make discovery a small part of your strategy and you will have a more enjoyable game. In my case, when I do a discovery, I will send the maximum expected to ensure success (of course counting to see if those high numbered tiles/cards aren't exhausted already), rather than risk failure.

May be one of the better worker placement game. It is way too long for what it is (common problem for worker placement games). Area-majority part is not as exciting as it should be as there were not enough conflicts when I played it. The decision becomes pretty limited towards the end of the game. Feel pretty constraint. 

The discovery has huge luck factor. I don't mind luck but for a game with this length, it is a problem. Also there is just not enough player-interactions.

Oh yeah, and it has the worst scoring track in the history of scoring tracks.

The game as it is seems kind of crowded, and this is mostly due to the components.  The board could be organized much better(larger colonies, larger score track).  The pieces would do better as wood, or plastic abstractions (ie. cannon for soldier, etc).

There is a good game hiding in amongst the clutter.

RATING: 5
Lots to like.  Questionable how much higher the rating goes, but it's solid at 8.  The integration of the theme works really well and the multiple paths are certainly there.  Only played with 3 so I'm curious to see what happens when there are more people shooting for the same limited resources.

The things that may keep the rating down:  
Brutal majority control scoring.  There is first and there is second and everyone else has wasted their investment.
Random Discovery strength requirement.  Getting hit with too many natives sucks - tons of investment lost.  Almost as bad is overcompensating.  You get a significantly smaller reward for weak discoveries compared to strong ones, but you have no idea which one you'll find until you get there.
----update----
A 7 is probably too generous.  But a 6 doesn't feel like it's necessarily enough.  As I don't give half points in my ratings this one will probably bounce around a bit until I figure out where it should settle.

---update---
I think it'll settle at 6.  There is some fun to be had here, but you can tell when you've been knocked out of contention half way through, and the game is too long to want to bear that too many times.  There are some interesting choices, but there are several forced choices and clearly sub-optimal choices as well.  The latter is masked by the action-denial mechanic, but I still feel as if interesting gameplay were sacrificed a few times too many for purposes of "theme" - particularly considering how thin that theme is overall.

I love the mechanics of this game, but I do think that there are some unbalances when it comes to the buildings.  I had this as a 9, but I've had to drop it to an 8.5.  I've seen some offerings of buildings that balance the game, but I'd like to see an official version, since I'm not convinced the ones I've seen truly balance it.  I also wonder if having all the buildings for an age available might actually help balance the game a bit.

Großartiges Spiel mit sehr interessanten Mechanismen und Elementen
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Age Of Empires III has Worker Placement, Area Influence, and Set Collection, making it a solid Euro, but also has (limited) warfare which gives it a little something extra.

Its not an overly long game, but there can be some downtime while players choose where to place their colonists.

The components are a mixed bag. The board is terrible. There are no places on it for the trade goods and capital building components, even though there is wide-open space in the center of the board. The victory track is the worst I've seen; it is dark, narrow, and the corners are obscured by some kind of blob-like decoration. (I should note that the board in the Eagle-Gryphon reprint, while more functional, is so much uglier that I prefer the original.) The coins, on the other hand, are excellent reproductions of the currency of the era. The figurines are well-modeled and brightly colored, but some of them are hard to distinguish from others. 

On a personal note, although the game gives a pretty good representation of how the European powers viewed the colonization of the New World, I find the theme offensive. The goal of the game is to wipe out 'Indians' and extract trade goods from newly discovered areas; it feels like you're raping the New World. Ick.

AoEIII would get more plays, but a close friend despises it.

My wish is that Martin Wallace is taking notes on this game design.  This has all the markings of Caylus, El Grande, and Wallace's bastard three-way child.  A good time that doesn't overstay its welcome, overwhelms players with multiple tactics for winning, and brings a healthy taste of "take that!" to a genre that needs more of it.

And I held my nose up forever on this because of the association with Microsoft's failed RTS game.  My bad.  My very, very bad.

A fun blend of Agricola and Puerto Rico with a bit of Age of Conan mixed in. The strategy demands both planning and flexibility in equal measure, which is a big plus for me.

Knowing how to balance your untis is important. There are some powerful combinations of buildings that takes a few plays to fully understand. Don't underestimate the missionaries.

RATING: 6
Worker placement + area control. The base idea is an area control mechanic where you play items every turn, for 8 turns, with 3 scoring turns. You can deviate resources and build some economy and have several options that allow several (not many) viable strategies.

Great bits (a small complaint: it's a bit difficult to distinguish some of the specialists). Even overproduced. 

The base idea is very nice, themathic, and creates a tense atmosphere while placing the settlers.

The main issue with this game is that it's not really balanced, especially with the tiles. Some buildings are way better than others, to the point of being game changers. If you happen to be the start player when they become available for sale, you will be in a perfect place to win the game.

RATING: 6
First impression: There are many pieces in the box but eventually the core mechanics of the game are quite simple. There is enough to think about during the game and choices you make aren't usually easy or obvious. There is some luck involved but only thing where it bothered me was the discoveries. There you're not compensated in any way for a journey that fails. Other negative thing is the figures, they look too much like each other and there should have been bigger differences between them. Game worked very well with 4 players but it might be too crowded on the board with 5.

Engine building and area majorities. Rather boring; It's too long and there's not much happening on the board. The buildings can be used for some nice combos but otherwise the game seriously lacks tension and excitement.

The components are very nice but there are some usability issues. First, the scoring track is completely useless. Using 6 VP and 2 VP counters for the map scoring would be much easier, faster, and way more reliable. Second, the map areas are too small for the colonist hordes. Finally, the box is of terribly thin cardboard.

I do think it will be better with more plays as I made some bad decisions and overlooked certain aspects. I tentatively rate this 7.5 as I've thought about where I've gone wrong (sign of a good game) and want to play again. The scoring track is awful. (7.5)

Più ci gioco e più me ne innamoro. Un gioco ben pensato dalle meccaniche fluide con molte strategia attuabili e nessuna prevale drasticamente sulle altre. Ho sentito di analogie con Puerto Rico; personalmente l'unico parallelismo l'ho visto nelle molteplici strade per arrivare alla vittoria, per il resto mi ricorda di più l'apprezzato Vasco da Gama (titolo più recente ma io li ho conosciuti in ordine inverso). Ritengo nel complesso il gioco non semplice e necessita di una partita di riscaldamento, difficile disputare una buona prima partita. Il potere di alcune opzioni e la scelta del colono (capitano, soldato, monaco, monaco) si apprende con il passare dei turni. Belle le monete, mentre i segnalini di plastica non sono eccellenti e tendono a confondersi, ma vista la monotonia di cubetti di legno, trovo questo ritorno al passato positivo. Il segnapunti a bordo tabellone è inutilizzabile, in questo caso meglio usare i classici cubetti di legno o il segnapunti di un Carcassonne. Trovo la combo monaco-cattedrale fortissima, ma non sono da sottovalutare nemmeno il mercante e il capitano. Nel complesso un gran bel titolo!

Good game that we can bring out every now and again, but it doesn't provide anywhere near the thrill that the other major worker placement games do. Of all of those, this ranks lowest on my list. A couple of things drag it down:

Difficulty in clearly identifying different figures
Clunky mechanics
Pointless midgame scoring and awkward score track
Imbalanced buildings

RATING: 5
This game stresses me out more than Dominant Species (a very similar worker placement/area control style game). Even after I had won, I still felt nerves. So why is this given a six while Dominant Species has a ten? Simply put, I didn't feel that this game gave me the opportunity to react well to my opponents' moves. Yes, it was DS light, but what they cut out was all the opportunities to adjust, recover, and strike back that Dominant provides. Perhaps that was why I was so stressed?

Area influence and worker placement game, which is cool.  Took me a couple plays before I started enjoying it.  Expansion looks to correct a couple of the beefs I had, i.e., only a couple victory buildings that are really good, the others are typically a lot less powerful.

I was worried that this might prove a bit too abstract for my gaming group.  However, it seems to strike just the right balance between abstraction and theme for us.  After one play this seems like a very good game and my rating could well go up.

There are lots of decisions to be made with somewhat limited resources in this game. I may be a bit below average in my total enjoyment of this game, but it's a solid design and the board and pieces are gorgeous. Probably shines with right group. Although the theme doesn't come through fully for me, neither does it come off as abstract, and it's one of those board games in which you really feel like you're moving pieces and DOING something. Figuring I was never going to find even one other person to play this with--no knock on the game itself--I sold it in February of 2011.

The 10 is for two players and four.  Fun decisions!  Cool different routes towards victory.  When deciding between 9.5 and 10, it was bumped up by the fact that my wife did not find it too confrontational as I had feared.  The strategies have evolved each game as we have improved our play.  We decided that Puerto Rico/El Grande in a unique package was the best way to describe it.  I am eager to try it out with others, but am limited in those who will play it with us.

The game has taken a longer time with four than I thought it would.  Each placement of the other players resets your internal prioritization as you re-evaluate the odds of getting what you want.  Or maybe my particular group thinks too much.  Either way, the downtime bordered on detracting from the game.

Very solid design.  The only complaint is that the Incan Empire tile is too strong if purchased first round - the cash infusion is very, very difficult for others to overcome (as it lets you buy two more Capital Buildings first round).  Perhaps cutting its payout down would solve this, but have not tried.

RATING: 7
A mesh of mechanics that's never entirely won me over. Worker placement, tile drafts, area majorities. There's a constrant threat of non-Euro type mano-on-mano conflict breaking out at any time with the warfare option. You can be collateral damage if majority wars break out in your areas leaving other areas to score the same without nearly as much effort. There's also big resolution luck in what you get with your discoveries, which is a blind commitment of resource, for which you may way over subscribe and get a poor return (money, vps) or you play the odds committing just the resources which would land you 90% of the discoveries but get one of the high ones and miss out altogether, your resources effectively flushed down the drain. On things such does your end-result turn. It's certainly decent to play, and engaging, but the post-game analysis for the winner seems to be how things went luckily for them, and for the losers seems to be on the what-ifs re things outside their control, no matter how decent a strategy or its implementation. Happy to play occasionally, but no need to buy.

Excellent worker placement game.  Don't expect a war game like the PC game.  You could attack someone but it is not the focus of the game, and the purpose would be to lower the opponent's population so that you can score the points for having the most population at the end of the age.  So it is definitely a Euro game.  There are many ways to score points, including building, collecting trade goods, discovering new territories, etc...

Played a 3-player game of the no-art prototype at Kublacon '06, and it was my favorite game of the 'con. Fantastic game, an interesting blend of Caylus worker placement, Puerto Rico special buildings, the Liberte area control game, and Age of Steam's delicious turn order & bidding mechanics. Can't wait to play this with my game group, we love deep games and this one will be a smash hit IMO.

Fairly complicated worker placement/area control game. I would put the weight a bit higher than the current 3.1, I think. The most confusing aspect, by far, is the special abilities of the different kinds of workers. The way workers come and go is also strange. 

Aside from the normal work placement competition for scarce resources, there are also battles over territories. Set collection and buildings with special abilities round out the mechanics.

I might play a game like this if it took an hour or less. Our 4p learning game took 2.5 after a 30 minute rules introduction. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Really good game with simple yet interesting worker placement mechanic. Not many games do that "different workers" stuff... The game is 7 years old now and plays really well compared to other, younger games. You have 5 different workers available but first you have to train them... You have to get goods to get more money, get ships to boost your goods collection... you need money to buy buildings that boost your workers numbers, VP and money... there's so much going on, it's a tight game. I love the fact that there are many possibilites and thus many strategies to come up with. You cannot focus on one action, you have to vary them, cause otherwise you will loose.
Great game that I got recently for a really good price... it's out of print but it will be back in print with new art and updated rules, that's what I heard at least.

First game with 3 was a great experience.  Good theme, strategy, planning, well executed turn mechanics, fantastic production.  Subsequent plays could very well elevate this to a 9 or 10.  If plays as well and as fun with 2, will be definate 9 or 10.

I really want to play again soon. I want to try 2 player to see if as good as they say.

4-5 Players

*****House rules*****

**Scouting**: At any time during your turn, you may pay to look at any face-down Discovery counter or card. The cost is $1 in Age I, $2 in Age II, and $3 in Age III. After looking at a face-down counter, return it to the same position, facedown.

OR

**Advanced Reconnaissance**: Before the game begins, turn all Discovery counters on the board face up. This will eliminate the possibility of failed expeditions and
increase the need for strategic planning.

**Buy Victory Points**:
players may (in Player Order) spend Spanish Dollars to buy Victory Points immediately following New World colony scoring. Players may buy as many Victory Points as they can afford. The cost is:
• Age I: $1 / 1 VP
• Age II: $3 / 1 VP
• Age III: $10 / 1 VP

**Reduced Luck Variant** — During setup, draw 10 of the Age III Buildings and discard the rest. Leave these Buildings face-up until Age III. These 10 are the potential Buildings that will come out in Age III. Randomize these 10 Buildings before refreshing the game board for turn 7.

**Buildings**

The $5 colonist spot can be used for $5 but also a 'building materials' can be purchased here - ie there are now two spots on this space, not one.

A building materials can be used either to lower the cost of
A Capital Building purchase by $5 or can be transported like a colonist to a territory where it increases the value of that territory +4 VP for first +2 VP for second.

I was pleasantly surprised after waiting a while to play this game. The game play is straightforward but there is a lot of interaction between players as you fight for position and majorities using different types of men (merchants, soldiers, etc). I am not sure if I would enjoy it at six, but at 2-4 it is quite fun and quite original. At some points you do find yourself with nothing to do with you men, so timing is important and quantity as well.

UPDATE: I have played this more than 10 times now, and it's only getting better. Can't wait to play more.

***

There is one thing I truley dislike in one of my 10:s. It is that generous board that actually proves to be insufficient. The small land-zones gets to crowded during a five-player game, and that big logotype above Canada takes up space that might have been precious landmass. I'm sure there is a perfectly good corporate reason for the size of the logo, too bad it also looks so tacky. With a board big enough to at least fill up the box, it would have been more practical even with the current map design.

(The small scoring track works just fine using the useless fountain markers from the dull Alhambra game; blue, green, yellow, red and orange - a perfect fit for AOEIII.)

But enough with my endless whining, AOEIII proves that the sum can be better than it's parts. It is an excellent game that gets better with every play. It is exiting, competitive and with 5 players it is always fierce (4 is almost as good & 3 works pretty fine). Play with fun loving people and a couple of beers and you won't go wrong.

It's not hard on non/casual gamers, but the lush production/detailed components might contrast to peoples expectations. At first glance AOEIII looks like something much more "hands on", but the merchant ships are "only" jokers and there is no strong sense of battle when your soldiers fight. The miniatures are pawns to use in chess like placement mechanics that gives a slight abstract feel to the game. AOEIII really IS competitive and fun, but at first sight you just might expect another kind of game.

Once you start playing it, it's not really that complicated although you are forced to make agonizing decisions all the time. But for some reason I find it much harder to explain the rules of AOEIII than, say Puerto Rico, Imperial or Power Grid. I think it due to all the specialist figures, and how they perfom when putting them in different places. Your strategy takes shape or alters ever so slightly with every single placement.

I was more reminded somewhat of Struggle of Empires. Struggle is more complex, aggressive and feels more concrete, but I prefer the sleeker, quicker and more stringent AOEIII.  

I play with discoveries tiles open.

RATING: 8
Interesting mix of worker placement and area control game mechanics. While being thematic, this game does not resemble the computer game where it borrowed the name, but when I started to play it for the first time I knew that already, so no disappointments with that. While warfare is very small part of the game, the interaction is well there when players compete for the resources and area control. I like how you can first develop your nation with the buildings that give nice bonuses during the game and in the late game struggle to get the buildings that net you a nice score boost in the end. Discovery attempts are always a thrill also!

It's probably the best of Glenn Drover's efforts and a nice overall design. 

It's not innovative, but it's good. It's yet another worker placement game with unique buildings thrown in a a bit of exploration. Randomness is present but is manageable and makes sense, most of the time (with the exception being in the available buildings). 

Game length is on the upper limit but it's not an impediment.  

I have some issues with the components (unnecessarily huge box, badly designed board and I don't really like plastic miniatures) but that's what I've learned to expect from eagle's productions.

Overall a solid game.

Rating based on one play where I got royally screwed by bad card draws. Part of it was of course my own fault as I focused on a discovery strategy, which is a very high risk gamble.

On top of this one player stumbled into a positive spiral (well of course he had a hand in devising it - but still none of his four opponents ever managed to break it). Halfway through the game it was pretty obvious that he'd won and by the end of the game he finished with double the score of the player that came in second.

The combination of euro strategy a la PR and the luck of the card draw (also to be experienced in Goa) is something I'm not overly fond of. But this whole situation might have been a fluke and I actually believe AoE III to be a good game. Further plays are needed before I'll settle on a definitive rating.

1/11/12 - I traded Memoir 44 for this game a long time ago and I might be regretting my decision. At first this game was awesome. There were tons of components and it seemed like a blast to play. Now that I've played better worker placement games the components seem way too similar which really bothers me and the units seem to be jam packed on the board so it becomes hard to tell what units are what. The game play also seems a lot more boring to me now. Unfortunately, when I traded for this game the box was damaged so I had to repair it. If the box was nice I totally would get rid of this in a heartbeat.

2/01/12 - I played this again and it was actually really fun. The similar looking figure models still drive me crazy but I like how the game has a set number of turns and it was much more enjoyable when I was in a better mood. I guess I'll be keeping this game.

7/15/12 - I still hate how the figure models look so similar. I also hate how lame the choices get toward the end of a 5 player game. I really can't get over how similar the figure models are and how fiddly the game is. I will try it again but I've downgraded it from a 7 to a 6.

This is a nice game that involves a lot of strategy.  It has only one problem:  it provides certain combinations of tokens that an experienced player can use to humiliate the newer ones.  Certain combos like "Missionary + Cathedral" gives to the player such power that can be difficult to stop.

This was the first 'real' game I played and it has held up quite well. It has interesting decisions to make and it plays reasonably fast with experienced players. The ability to attack other players is a nice feature to have in a worker placment game. 
The theme is rich and well-integrated; I use it is a teaching tool in my junior high social studies class and the kids genuinely learn about colonization through playing it.

Very nice interaction game that I haven't figured out how to play well yet.   Capabilities to develop are discovery, colonization, mercantalism, and imperialism.  These amount to a good meaty play with many trade offs to consider.  Played once with three players, and it worked pretty well and within 2 hours.

Feels a bit like a collection of familiar mechanics:  a little worker placement, a little area control, a little set collection.  Components up and down (nice gold pieces and interesting plastic dudes, but thin cardboard and failing box -- but priced right).  Rules, I think, need some work for clarity.  The game may in fact be broken.  Frankly, I've never disagreed so vehemently with the general rating for a game.

RATING: 7
If you can get past the "let's go conquer the Native Peoples of the Americas" theme this is a pretty fun game. After a few games the first couple placements each turn feel a little too prescribed though since you have to get the good buildings and you need the specialists in every strategy I've seen or attempted so far.

A pretty decent game. Certainly not bad. Similar gameplay to Dominant Species (which I think is a much better game, but it is more complex). Age of Empires III is pretty easy to learn. And the artwork is nice. A bit strange that it's branded with Age of Empires III as it doesn't really have anything to do with the gameplay of the computer game (just the theme, I suppose)

I've only played this once so far, but was very impressed with it.  Importantly the game just made sense while reading the rules.  Certain rules mechanics are borrowed from, or inspired by, other games and thus have a degree of familiarity which helps get to grips with it; the imported/inspired bits have been very well chosen however and work very well together.  The initiative/extra money track is a good innovation and has a simple but effective "swings and roundabouts" effect.  
On one playing only it's hard to comment on strategy; at this stage it looks like there are plenty of viable routes to win while none seem to be the obvious "easy way" to win.  

The board is lovely; a good balance between decent artwork and well-laid out game mechanics.  The figures are good (and if painted up will probably look fantastic) and even the plastic money (styled on doubloons) is great.

Not sure about this yet. Only played it once and we got a significant rule wrong so that it wrecked the game (allowing colonists in the Discovery box to be placed in the region they discover instead of discarding them). Seems like a good game with lots of tough decisions with limited resources, multiple paths to victory and player interaction.
Edit: Played twice more by the correct rules. A LOT more fun. Seems much like Caylus with added randomness and theme. Very excited about this game right now.

A very interesting game that, as with many Kramer games, sets down the basic rules and allows the game to develop in a variety of ways. I find the play more enjoyable than Caylus as it feels more fluid and less forced. It is nice to see a Euro-style game with the plastic minis rather than the typical wooden blocks as it not only adds flavor to the game but speeds up the analysis of the game. (A captain, for example, is a figure with a spyglass and is quickly recognized versus being a slightly larger block, etc.) The game scales well and it is impressive how well the various systems are integrated.  The "War" aspect is minimal if nearly non-existent as there are so many other places to play. However, a well placed soldier/battle can change the majority in an area and conceivably, the winner. (Ignore soldiers are your own  risk.)

Worker Placement and area control fused into a delicious sandwich. The way the action board resolves is very similar to, but less harsh than, Dominant Species. One of the interesting things here is you can use a few different spots to turn your workers into specialty workers who will count for twice the strength or unlock a special ability when used. The game starts out where everything seems possible, and then you realize as the colonist dock fills up, and as people grab the trade goods, and as the player ahead of you in turn order drops his captain in the merchant ship box, that you'll have to do better to get what you want.

The board is very pretty, but needs a major redesign for usability. This is a seriously, almost to the point of non-functional board. The new world provinces are too tiny and all the plastic workers have to be bunched up to prevent clarity as to where they stand. I suppose they had to make them small so they could print "AGE OF EMPIRES III" in huge letters at the top of the board. Even on the actions board the graphic design of "PUT A WORKER HERE" is inconsistent. If there's ever a second edition, I'm there.

This game was renamed because they lost the license to Age of Empires III. They neglected to ever print a copy of the game with the new name... so yeah... confusion. Also, the expansion comes with new AND replacement buildings, because the backs of the tiles were printed differently.

It is very much a hybrid of the worker placement of Caylus, the area majority of El Grande and the building powers of Puerto Rico, but they're combined together so nicely that the lack of originality doesn't matter. I'm keen to try this again with more than three players and to see how much real strategic variance is possible.

UPDATE: plays with 4 and 5 confirm the quality of this game. Has three or four overall strategic paths, with a lot of tactical variance within each, much like Puerto Rico.

A combination of worker placement and area control. The rounds consist of claiming trade goods to build your economy, building to provide rule exemptions, improving your workers to use. Like the era, the randomness of discovery doesn't really bother me, however a defeat can mean a lot of lost actions. There are benefits to opening an area worth the risk. However, the the randomness of the building do bother me, if the tiles your strategy needs come out so much the better if not you are hosed. 
All in all the game seems rough around the edges. 
Personally If I want to play something in this era it would be Struggle of Empires

Considering that you are playing in a time of exploration, this game is very linear and dry. I do like the basic flow of the game and the various characters and abilities make for simple, yet nice tactical decisions, but why not make the 'new world' more random, luck-based and exciting, sort of mix up the dry Euromechanics with some real discovering. The designers went for the save route but for the sake of more excitement in my opinion. For a Eurogame, this has amazing pieces and that definitely notched up the rating a little bit. 

EDIT: After a few plays, I think the game is not flexible enough despite random buildings and goods, the game plays very similar each time, especially with experienced players who decide on one strategy and keep going for it for the whole game.

One of the first games I ever acquired in the hobby and consistently one of the highest rated. Age of Empires III (also known more recently as Glenn Drover's Empires, presumably due to some copyright law issues) is an interesting and thematically rich euro. It has aspects of set collection, economic balance, light warfare, and competition for limited action spaces. It is tight, tense, and interesting and I believe falls somewhere in the medium range of weight. The components are lovely, especially the coins which I found myself re-purposing for other games. A solid title to be sure.

So much going on here, it seems like a couple things ended up getting the short shrift.

Beautiful job with the components, however, and the rule book is quite good and straightforward.  Almost great, but not quite, in my book.

My only play of this was with six players.  Six players are too many!!  But here are my thoughts regarding a six player game.

I like the different action spots.  There are a lot of different choices and the players must decide not only where to put their pieces but [i]when[/i] to put their pieces.

There area control aspect is also very nifty.  The unusual combination of area control and worker placement is refreshing.

There's no way to combat a run-away leader.  If everyone tries to beat up on a run-away leader, they will neglect their own business.  In my only play, it was obvious who was going to win about an hour and a half into the game.  It took us four hours (only three of that was actual game time)!  Half of the game was spent already knowing who would win.  That's just too much for me.

I was first offended by the cover art depicting colonial warfare when, in fact, there was none in the game. I was also disapointed by the lack of native units. However, after noting the high ratings and reviews, I decided to take the plunge. The result is that this is one of my favorite games. The alternate placement of pieces really keeps things moving. The varying paths to victory are a definite plus. The overall theme and flavor along with ease of play and replayability should keep this game rated high for some time.

Though the game has scoring rounds designed in a way I dislike, they make sense with the theme (I.E. Changing eras trigger the scoring round - makes somewhat abstract sense with flow history). Overall, a fun experience with many levels of strategy.

Flavors of Caylus and Pillars of the Earth blend to create a game with wide-open possibilities.  The game is a bit longer than it should be, but this doesn't diminish the game experience.  The board is functional, but it doesn't feel like it's laid out optimally (the New World feels cramped).  Overall, a decent game, but the buildings are a bit too unbalanced and this makes the game a bit too random for the duration and depth.

Played this game which is a worker placement cum area control game. For some reason though it has a theme that usually interests me, this game just doesn't gel well with me after each play so far. Maybe it's the abstract way it deals with the various themes of colonization (exploring, conquering a territory etc) that doesn't "wow" or falls flat me with me. 

Still an ok game that I don't mind playing once in a while but will never request for.

When I first saw this game I though it looked dreadful, with the tacky-looking plasic men and what seemed to be a grab-bag of mechanics stolen from other games. I actively avoided playing it at our games club for several months. Even having played it I though it was a bit scripted.

Yes the men look too similar, some placements are rather obvious and players can end up in a no-win situation quite early on in the game, but now it's one of my favorite games. I'm still not sure quite how that happened.

Not my favorite game, but this is probably the most-played game in my collection.  It hits a sweet spot between luck, strategy, simplicity, engagement, and playing time.  Very little downtime even with 5 players.  It is very well designed and the rules and theme are nicely integrated.

The only gripes I have is that the last set of buildings can make or break a victory and slow things down as people count victory points.  Also, new players may feel cheated if they didn't fully understand the implications of the benefits of the final buildings.  But these are minor gripes and it isn't unusual to finish and have people say, "Let's play again!" - Always the mark of a good game.

Finally, a worker placement game with an engaging theme. Lots of strategic options, and expansive rather than narrow puzzle gameplay. I'm fine with the random elements, and prefer them to a wholly deterministic system. 

My beer and pretzel group loves this game. It has enough strategic depth to keep us engaged, and enough conflict to exercise some beer-fueled agression.

Edit (still June '09): Still loving it the more and more we play it.  We've probably played 6 new great games in last 6 months (Agricola, Tigris & Euphrates, Small World, Age of Steam, AOE3, and more).  AOE3 is right up there.  Just below Agricola, I'd say.... but Steam may beat it out in the end.

Edit (Jan. '10): Allen surprised me with a gift copy today, so now I own it.  It's in my Top 5 games, but I've never owned it since other friends did.  Pumped about playing it any time I want now.....  Thanks to Allen.

**#8 in my first ever Top 200 (March 2013)**

After settlers of catan, then agricola, i bought this game. My board game addiction was born!!!!! This is a very strategic game, with a lot to plan ahead. Not good with 2 players, unless you cover up some action spaces.

This appears at first glance to be a long, civilization building conquest game. Actually its a fairly managable worker placement/majority control game. Somehow it seems odd to have those mechanics with this theme but the result does work quite well. The game is challenging, has relatively low luck, and never overwhelms with cards and additional options in the way that Caylus/Agricola/Le Havre do. It also plays surprisingly quickly - with six players, five of whom had not played previously, we finished in under four hours.

A strategy game literally drowning in options.  The sheer number of options to choose from often seems to detract from the experience just as much as it adds though.  It's a difficult game to teach and get your head around, but if you do, it can be quite fun.

(9/25/07) - Got got this from POZY.com. I loved the computer game and I heard great things about the board game adaptation.

(12/27/07) - [8] - With 2 games under my belt I am definitely a fan. Multiple paths to victory and excellently balanced. Lots of fun with 2, would be absolutely amazing with more! Currently rated at an 8.

(2/22/08) - [7] - After playing my first 3-player game today I'm worried about the balance of the game. There appears to many paths to victory, but the surefire way to win seems to be whoever can get the most Merchant Ships. Re-rated to a 7.

(10/11/08) - [3] - Turns out that in previous games we had been incorrectly implementing Merchant Ships, making them extremely overpowered. Even after fixing this error, I have realized this game is broken. A player who is devoted to discovering can hope to earn 6VPs every scoring round for a total of 18VPs. A player who simply piles up Merchant Ships and Trade Goods can get either the Navy or Mercantile Building in Age 3 and earn 20+ VPs. I don't expect to ever play this again.

(09/21/2014) - [2] - It only took me six years, but I finally looked closer at the BGG rating guide and determined that Age of Empires III qualifies as a [2].

(11/02/2016) - SOLD - Age of Empires III made the final trip to Goodwill today. I did not ever foresee a time that I would want to play this again. A long overdue removal from my collection.

I love the worker placement aspect of this game, similar to what was later done in Dominant Species. The struggle for map board position can be quite intense, but there are other paths you can take to victory. I always have fun when this hits the table and I am glad I finally got the Builders expansion to add to it.

I really like the game. Feels like Puerto rico, but I like it better.
It has exploration and development, it has player interaction (you can really mess up someone), has a good feeling of building up an empire.

I would prefer if last round scoring earn less VPs (most VPs are scored in last round), and I'd like one more round in 3rd age. It really ends quickly (3rd age, not the game)

RATING: 8.2
Excellent Euro-style game with American style aesthetic. There are several viable strategies for winning and it scales well-  though each additional player adds more confrontation to the game and gives the game a different tone. 

Luck is relatively minor, but the random elements work to keep the game fresh and allow it to play differently every game. Replay value has been very good, mostly due to the random elements that vary from game to game.

AoE III is not a short game, but it plays fast. Some games are long games and  feel  like long games. This is more in the Die Macher style- in that the game goes by at a good pace and you don't realize it just took 2 hours to play. There is very little downtime and you are always involved.

Read through the rules a few times and set up the board. Looks good... very good but couldn't get any of the kids to bite. It may be time to play the dad-card and insist that my older 2 kids unplug the Nintendo-whatever and join dad for a few plays of this game. 

Update - my oldest daughter and I enjoy this game!  Bumping my rating up a notch.  Highly recommend this game if you like the worker/placement strategy thing (no dice!) and also have an interest in the exploration of the New World. Theme could be anything but somehow, the European exploration of the New World just seems to be the PERFECT fit!

I very much enjoyed my first playing of this, and found it a nice change from what I remembered most Eagle games to be like.  Every decision seemed defensible, but you knew only a few were the best moves.  Nice tension.  Figures could be a bit more differentiated, but that's a minor quibble.  Nice game!

UPDATE: Entirely too long with 5 players.  It's really inconceivable that the game is even playable with 6.  Additionally, I found the game much too constrained and difficult for my tastes with this many people.  I'll stick to the three-player game if I'm given the choice.  A recent four-player playing confirmed this for me.

It's hard to rate such a complex game after only 1 play (2007-06-30), but I enjoyed it.  It took longer than I'd like, but I imagine it would speed up with experience.  Lots of different subsystems and possible strategies.  It reminded me of a blend of Puerto Rico and Age of Renaissance.

After one play I've come to the conclusion that this is just a heavier version of Stone Age. Could be a bad comparison, but that's how I felt. In any case, I love this game. There's a lot less of a luck factor like there is with Stone Age.

All in all this is a game I think I'll enjoy for a while, or at least hope to. There are many routes to victory, something Stone Age really doesn't have.

RATING: 4
While playing Age of Empires III I figured out that the test for whether or not I am enjoying a long game is this: If I feel like I have to actively try and speed the game along, it is not a game I'm enjoying. Anything interesting only occurs in the last third of the game and until then it is very repetitive.

And it is true that some of the figures are hard to distinguish from one another but that is not as annoying as how hard it is to read what is happening on the left (New World) side of the board. It's bad enough as to be confusing even if there aren't any figures covering the area!

Funny thing though; I like this action selection mechanic better here than in Leonardo da Vinci.

After 1 play with 3 players this is a solid game. I need more plays to solidify this rating, but I could see it going up. I don't see it going down. 

More plays now, great game. I suck at it, and my wife kills me at it every time, but its a ton of fun. For a long game it moves quickly. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like all the different paths to victory. There's a lot of tension with such tight competition for limited resources. I'm really impressed with how the mechanics were implemented in this game. While a player can spend a lot of time analyzing to situation to make the optimum move, the chaos factor associated with the number options available, the dynamic turn order, and the number of players keep the outcome ever in doubt as you can never be sure how your planned course of action will turn out. There is often times no "absolute" best move in this game, and I really like that in a game. As a 4-5 player game, I'd rate this a 9 or 10. As a 2-3 player game, I'd give it a 7 or 8. The pace of the game and the competition for resources is quite different depending on the number of players. 2-3 is fun 4-5 is much better.

This is interesting game with many different mechanics and paths to victory.  It has a bit of a learning curve to it.  It will take a couple of plays to fully understand the many paths to victory and which one works best for you.

Best expansion - 

Best extra/variant - 

Strategy - Getting extra men is key so you get more actions per turn.  Controlling the New World has many points so explore.  Money is important so get a money path early.

RATING: 6
--May2007-- Fascinating game with (in my opinion) some graphic faults.  I'd personally find counters or blobs of wood in different shapes easier to parse visually than the Captain/Soldier figures (or Merchant/Settler to a slightly lesser extent) which blend together into a homogeneous blob from across the table.  Equally, by the end of the game the new world is _full_ of plastic; smaller objects (or stackable objects) would tile better and be easier to evaluate.  Once one's past the visuals the game seems very good (modulo one's tolerance of the random discovery results, at least.)
--Jun2007-- Like Caylus, it's a bit long for what it is.  Too much time is spent on the mechanics of playing the game, and not enough on the actual playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the better games to come along in a while.  There are a lot of ways to play this, and enough room in the mechanics for just about everyone's strategy to be feasible.
This game scales well...  6 players plays as well as 5.  Bits are great as well...  though a bit of a pain to seperate at the begining of play...  and the chocolate ships...  while cool, these serve only as eye candy and would have been better had they been cardboard chits.  It seems that many of the strategies are valid, just make sure that you pick one early and try to stick with it.  Very enjoyable, though Im not sure what it has in common with the video game.

[color=#CC0000]

The epitome of the Power Euro.  This game has one of everything in it, and to some extent it succeeds at that task.  But I'll leave it to you to decide if that's a good thing or not.

I'm coming to fully realize how much I dislike worker placement and this game is a big part of what convinced me.  It's another game where you don't get to do what you want to, you get to do what's left, regardless of whether it's useful to you or not.  The nature of the mechanic is to dis-empower the player.  It's competition, but it's not play.  A two-hour session of "what's left" becomes two more hours of work in my congested schedule, and I don't get paid to do it.

For what it's worth.

If you like this game you'll very likely enjoy [b][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9625]Struggle of Empires[/url][/b] more.  Much more.  It's an order of magnitude more intense and engaging, and provides pathways for you to make [u]your[/u] game work, instead of playing "what's left."

Pros: Many and impressive components, excellent theme, interesting and intense gameplay, multiple ways to victory and fantastic combination of various mechanisms.

Like the the baby offspring of Caylus' worker placement for mechanic selection rules, and El Grande's region scoring mechanics. Ruleswise, a very solid game indeed. Additional randomness is introduced by concealed information, however. Bits-wise, the coins are superb, the ships are pretty cool (though not as nice as Pirates of the Spanish Main from Wizkids), but I find the colonist/specialist pieces a little garish and hard to tell apart from a distance.

This is a clever civilization simulation where players take on the task of discovering and settling The New World. Each turn players get a set of figures, each one granting an ability, and they then place them on the board indicating what each will do.  Actions vary from colonizing, acquiring goods, constructing buildings, discovering new territories, upgrading a figure, and even battling.  Many actions grant points and/or money; at the end of the game the player with the most points wins. 

Players never have enough figures to do everything they want in a turn, and given there are only a few slots available per action players are competing for these. Each turn players must carefully weigh what they want and what the other players will likely want. There are diverse strategies, and no two games are the same.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good, if a bit uninspired, medium worker placement, a step up from Stone Age but firmly below Agricola. Some luck, some negative interaction, ability to develop varying strategies, scales as well from 2 to 6 (if you get another set of colonist, for example from the expansion) as anything else. Lacks the intensity and tightness of heavier games, but it only makes it more accessible to casual gamers. Recommended.

RATING: 7
Seems to have a good level of appeal to players of either a euro or theme game disposition. Tense, involving, gameplay moves at a steady pace. Many paths to victory, and players must react to the strategies of everybody else at the table. All round a good, solid game.

RATING: 9
Brilliant medium-heavy game that is surprisingly accessible to casual gamers and many non-gamers. I'm almost always up for playing this one. For me, the heavy luck penalty/reward in the discoveries and some of the useless capital buildings keep this from a 10. I expect these issues to be less significant for other players. I look forward to the upcoming expansion with its all-new capital buildings. This might push it to a 10.

RATING: 8
So much better and faster with three players than with five - I've changed my rating to reflect my opinion on this as a three and maybe even the four (experienced) player game. Engaging and fun - can drag a little in places as players become familiar with building abilities. A balanced spread of points across the different methods of earning them seems like a good bet. Discovery luck irks me a bit - maybe playing face up I'll enjoy it more - thematically though I like face down better. Box is flimsy and damaged on arrival. You really need to paint the specialists in some way so they can be differentiated by other players at a glance (not just those on the board, but also those waiting to be played off the board) - it's very annoying thinking you've got the merchant sown up only to realise you've mistaken an off board merchant for a settler. The design of the board could have done with more room in the colonies, all the specialists special abilities outlines should be shown, including when placed as colonists. The building tile abilities could have been differentiated for easy viewing from the other side of the table. Rules are vague in places (I was wondering what I did with the remaining eight discovery tiles), and scattered - the rulebook starts off in great detail and then becomes vague to the point where I need to search for the FAQ online. Faced with playing Caylus or this I think this might get more play because of the theme, but in so many ways it doesn't deserve to. fun for now while I continue to explore the strategies.

Nevertheless, it also has some new features, like the Specialists funtions.  Our group have detected four main strategies:  The military (oh yes, it can be done), the colonists', the conquerors' and the merchants', and of course a mix between them.  The weak point of the design could be the balance of the buildings and the colonists' strategy, which may be too strong if a killer combo is reached, like having the [i]Cathedral[/i] and the [i]Monastery[/i].

This game got bandied about a lot in threads where fans of Agricola and the like were looking for new games to play. I took the repeated recommendations to heart and picked up a copy. I've only played it once (with just two players) but I can certainly see what the hype is/was about - it's a pretty nifty little game with some interestingly combined mechanics (worker placement, set collection, semi-tech trees, etc.)

This is an interesting worker placement/area control game. The push your luck element in launching expeditions can be a little annoying if your expedition fails or is low value, but overall the mechanics work well. You can score from area control, discovery tiles/cards, trade good income, and capital buildings, so there are a nice mix of options. You're going to have to do a mix of different things, but you can focus more on one thing or another. I like that there are different types of workers, with certain workers being better in certain spaces.

Only one play (3-player) so far, but looking forward to another go. Don't judge this game by the cover, or what you might think based on its source material. Fun and engaging worker placement game, with meaningful decisions but doesn't seem as overbearing with choices as Caylus, Agricola, and similar.

RATING: 8
Caylus meets El Grande.  The packaging (nice bits, big board) both help and hurt the game.  It helps the game because you can't help but get into it once you start playing.  It hurts the game because people think it's an american war game (instead of a euro game with american bits which it is) and don't want to play.  Many paths to winning.

RATING: 5
Worker placement and area majority are two of my favorite mechanisms, and this game has both! Plus it does them well, and has beautiful plastic figurines to boot! This game has cajones! Also love the warfare mechanic, and the fact that you don't have to be militant to win.

Only thing that keeps this from being my favorite worker-placement game is balance issues. I'm not entirely sure all the strategies are well-balanced. It also doesn't scale well to below 4-5 players, so it's hard to get this on the table.

Update: Probably a little dated for its time. Hard to get 5-6 to play this, and I'd rather be engulfed in the player asymmetry of Chaos in the Old World at this point.

Can run a bit long with people who feel the need to spend several minutes placing a single colonist. Still worth it though. I've played this a number of times and it has never been anything less than a fun and interesting experience, though it certainly wouldn't hurt if it were shorter.

The components are very beautiful, but I'm annoyed that it seems they chose to go with good looks at the expense of functionality a few times too many.

After a number of plays, I can't get over what a great game this is. Tough choices in great worker placement system. The theme of exploration and conquest of the New World really comes through (much more so than Endeavor). The game also scales nicely from 3 to 5 (not so good with two).

A wonderful area control game with set-making elements and empire building.  Wonderful bits as well.  Can't wait for this one to make the table again!

I have to say that I knocked this one down to an 8 only because of length and potential for AP.  It's fun, but it can drag and people can really get locked up on all of the decisions to be made.

RATING: 7
I've watched this game grow from foetus into the gem we see today. many comment on apparent flaws that actually are well designed balancing shemes like the Discovery & Luck the tiles etc. It's a unique game and it teaches very fast (about 10 minutes).

Edit 01-12-08 I piped it down a bit from a 9 to an 8. Don't know why exactly but I felt after my last game (which I won) like I just didn't care anymore... It happened on more then one occasion that I or others had to ask whose turn it is. As another poster here said too, that is typically a sign that players are not really involved / experience angst or anything like that. Hope this feeling will not stick...

Update: I don't know... there is something about the game that makes me want to play less and less. I can't say I look forward to playing it, and then again I don't find it a crime either when I do play. I suppose I never get fully immerged by AoeIII 'anymore' or... was I ever? I played Caylus the other day, and although it has nothing to do with that game apart from the worker placement, that kind of 'angst' never comes to me in a game of AoeIII. The stress of 'my spot being taken by another player' is seldom felt. Some of that has to do with the fact that the only truly place to feel this 'angst' is in the Capitol Building placement, since it is the most comparable perhaps to a single worker-building. But if taken by someone else earlier in turn order, that feels like a done deal and there is nothing that you really could have done about it (besides being earlier in turn order, duh). So it's easier to just sigh and be done with it. Apart from that the game bogs down much faster to 'scripted' placing and many times players seem to forget it's their turn. Finally I'm beginning to relate to the people that are sometimes surprised by the fact that they have done so well/bad in the game, when it's time to score. Sometimes someone wins or loses and I have no clue why that happened. I have an idea, but what it is exactly... That can be frustrating as it is a sign that I don't really understand what is going on in the game. Which is strange jet again because I've played it almost two dozen times...

The theme is well integrated into the mechanics.  For example, discovery must take place before colonization; and missionaries convert natives.

Simply one of the best worker-placement games I've played.  It takes a while to play, and it's high in both strategy and randomness.  In fact, I think it finds a good balance between the two.  

[COLOR=#006600][b]Why we own it: [/b][/COLOR] Unlike other worker placement games, in addition to the generic workers, some worker tokens have specializations — making them better suited to some tasks than others.

RATING: 2
Dominant Species light. Even if it came before. Works pretty well for what it is: some worker placement, some area control, some set collecting. It's thematic and there's some conflict even (not a lot, but just enough that, if you want it, you can have it). 

For area control/worker placement it's quite neat and I'd prefer it over DS as its scope is much more manageable (simpler, quicker). If there's a minus, it's the visuals. Mostly the tiles could be nicer or more readable. Not sure if plastic soldiers are a must, 5 types of meeples would work as well (merchant and colonist are hard to tell apart). 

EDIT: Rating as low as Samo will not willingly play most of worker placements.

I struggle with the theme. Playing a colonial power during the time that colonialists massacred indigenous people to steal the land and then brought in a quarter of the population of Africa as slaves is a hard sell for me. I find it a racist rewriting of history, missing many key elements that made the invasion possible trivializes one of the terrible periods in history.

As for the gameplay itself, I find that they re-used mechanics from a variety of games, but not in a good enough way that it stands out. Each mechanic is better in another game IMHO. Even with a different theme, I'd find this one more mediocre.

Most recent play Jan '16.

RATING: 7.5
Rather enjoyable euromesh-of-mechanics boardgame. Think Caylus (you place colonists to take actions, you upgrade units and buy buildings for extra powers) and Goa (you attempt discovery missions) and El Grande (you dump colonists into newly discovered land for area control VPs). Essentially, players are trying to gain VPs from a variety of methods including area discovery, set collection, area majorities, building purchases. There's a nice feel of escalating tension as the game goes through the ages.

The plumage on this one is really something (beautiful board, plastic bits, coins etc). Though it feel rather 'been there, done that', this one actually plays well, is balanced and much less laboured than Caylus.

Good game. There is plenty to do, and also lots of potential for conflict. I appreciate the fact that there are a number of different viable strategies to pursue.

RATING: 8
AoE III does not feel at all like the computer game it is licensed from, and I think this is a good thing. Hopefully they got the attention they wanted from this (unnecessary) license though. Playing AoE is interesting and the rules work quite well. Worker(settler) placement feels very much like Caylus. You always seem to want place more workers on your turn than it is possible. There is some luck, but not too much. Propably just the right ammount for me.

Just one note to the desinger. It is not a good idea to rate your own games at BBG. Especially if you praise them so blatantly. This absolutely does not help your games to succeed but rather makes you look like a douchebag.

I had some mixed feelings after my first play of this.  4 of the players were separated by 3 points (63,63,62,60).  The 5th player went a missionary strategy and ran away with the game with 113 points.  I was told after the game that someone has to go a military strategy to counter a missionary player, but the player who does that sacrifices in other areas, I would think.  I guess the best thing would be if nearly everyone had some military in the new world.

I liked the mechanics of the game, but I will need to have future plays dispel my impression that a missionary strategy is dominant to really feel great about the game.

Area Control, Economic, Building, Worker Placement. Enjoyable first play with three. It feels like the same type of game as Caylus or Pillars of the Earth with the colonist placement, but with an exploration/expansion theme. I'm concerned the game would be too long with 4-5 players, but willing to try it. Solid game, though.

Update: played with 5 and actually quite liked it at that number as well. Later sold it and then regretted it. Pretty sure I'll get the reprint in 2015.

I liked this game a lot more than I thought I would.  I thought it was going to be the typical multi-player "Eagle Games-type" Ameritrash combat and/or civilization game, and the numerous plastic figures and computer-inspired name didn't help my first impression.  The players commented that it was somewhat similar to Caylus, since there are lots of choices for many different actions.  I'd like to play it again sometime.  It seems like the capital buildings are rather important in the beginning of the game.  I'll have to remember that.  One of the best aspects of the game is that it plays rather quickly.I think most gateway players such play this instead of Caylus.  There is some confrontation that most such games lack.

Nem tudok fogást találni a játékon, hiába is próbálom. Egyszerűen ez a játék szinte tökéletes. A szerencse szerepe minimális, egyedül a felfordított lapoknál jelentkezik, de ott sem nagy mértékben. Igazi ereje a játéknak a többféle stratégia és itt a többféle tényleg nagyon sokat jelent. Egy játék alapján is látszott, hogy nagyon sok út vezethet a győzelemhez. Fontos része a játéknak a taktika is. Figyelni a többi játékos tervét és ahhoz alkalmazkodni, egy körön belül is megváltoztatni az eredeti célkitűzést és máshova rakni a telepeseket. Nagyon komoly játék, amiben felfedeznek, hódítanak, építenek, terményeket gyűjtenek és harcolnak is a játékosok. Egyedül talán a játékidő lehet sokak számára hosszú, de úgy érzem így teljes a játék. Kíváncsi lennék kis játékosszámmal is működik-e.

[2013-12-01]
Nos 3-an nem igazán működik, pontosabban az árura menés nagyon erős stratégia. Igaz, ha mindenki arra megy, akkor szoros lehet, de hárman nincs sok út sajnos. Illetve azt korábban elfelejtettem jelezni, hogy mi olyan házi szabállyal játszottuk, hogy a felfedezés lapok felfedve látszottak így minden felfedezés tervezhető volt, csökkentve a szerencse szerepét. Szerintem ez is jobb így. A játékot továbbra is nagyon jónak tartom, de 4-5-en javaslom csak játszani. Egyet emiatt rontok is a pontján.

RATING: 5
After my first overly long play of AoE III everyone immediately wanted to try to fix it (including those that had played before).  Even after years of trying to get this game right it seems that they reached the deadline and decided that it was now or never.  I suspected as much immediately when those that played it before exclaimed that the money doesn't make any sense.  The gold should be fives instead of tens otherwise you run out of ones -- most things are payed out less than ten.  Not a huge gripe by any means, but an indication of potential problems.  It was immediately apparent that the new world map was going to be confusing once pieces started getting scrunched in. So perhaps with obvious development flaws in front of us, I was  too keenly suspicious.  Still, I had heard good things about this from people that I respect, so I wanted to give it a real go.

The brunt of luck bears a serious burden on the design.  More than just the absurdity of the exploration rewards/penalties (which should not be discounted), the "Building" tiles and the Trade Goods draw are just too random to plan for.  In the game you can play for initiative, but you don't actually know what you are trying to get in first for.  Like many drafting games, those that are in the right place at the right time have the advantage.  There is some minor decision making in your selection, but often the choices are very clear.  Once you have set down a certain path with trade goods, you will need to get those particular trade goods, if they don't come up you are humped, if they do you need to hope that no one else takes them from you.  The fact that they are trade goods, yet you cannot trade them with people seems absurd.

The difference of a few coins in the first turn are a pittance to the disadvantage of a poor draw in turn order.  Not only do you not have the advantage of getting worthwhile buildings, but you also need to spend a guy to get to a relevant position in the next turn.

Players that have more pieces have the advantage (which is fine, I guess), but when they have residual pieces they can just gain money after people drop out with the turn order, which makes lagging players lag a little farther behind as they are farther behind in turn order and farther behind with money.

My biggest complaint is that at the beginning of every turn you must do the math to figure out if other people are going to be able to beat you to certain things, the race for the merchant ships is especially tiring.  The pieces are difficult to recognize anyway, trying to asses whether it will be worth it to try to gain dominance means that you actually have to spend time asking each player if they can beat you.  If not you effectively lose your turn.  You must do this kind of analysis when placing you pieces into each region as well.  

I find this game systematic, completely reactionary yet without any real excitement. Everything here feels cobbled together. People compare this game to Caylus or Puerto Rico, but for me everything that this game tries to do, Leonardo DaVinci does more elegantly.

This has been my favorite worker placement game. With many paths to victory and easy rules it was an instant like to for me. 

Problem is getting it on the table because of the Name, everyone thinks it is a war game.

Only played this once so far but I enjoyed it a lot. I think it will take several more games to really understand the strategies involved. With only 8 turns in the game it feels like you really have to make every turn count for as much as possible. I love the decisions you have to make and the simplicity of simply placing a colonist or specialist into an event box to choose your actions and then seeing it all play out once everyone has placed all their pieces. I also like how there are definately different strategies you can use to win the game. The board itself and all the pieces are also really beautiful.

It just has everything a Euro should have. The rules are eloquent and easy to explain, the bits are amazing, the pacing of game play is perfect, just the right amount (very little) of luck, player interaction of the space-taking, not so nasty sort, etc. The warring is such a small part of this game that confrontation-haters will still feel comfortable here. And it's just a joyful experience to play. 

One thing I truly respect in the design and absolutely love about the gameply is that there is really no "upkeep" mechanism here to have to deal with. You never have the hassle and stress of having to feed your family like in Agricola or deal with polution like in Antiquity, or unhappiness and hunger like in Through the Ages. Makes for a less frustrating, but still tight, strategic and fun game - brilliant, really. Almost makes you wonder why some games have such upkeep mechanics and brutal punishments within their design. 

The drawbacks I find all have to do with the board, which really, really should have been redesigned before production: the victory track is a joke, as it is too small and just plain silly. Also, the regions are too small for when more and more figures start pilin' up. Oh-one more thing, i'm not too impressed with the art on the tiles, as they are thematic, but generally hard to read from a distance.

Although nothing like the computer game after which it is cynically named for marketing purposes, this is superb and up there with Puerto Rico and Power Grid. Fairly simple to learn, all the rule reminders are printed on the board, and a decent amount of strategic depth. Awesome.

RATING: 9
Quality game here, with beautiful and interesting bits.  There's lots of tension in your placement of pieces, as you're hoping you might get to do something on your next round, [i]but only if no one gets there first[/i]. There are at least a couple of strategies to pursue: discovery, trade goods, or colonization.  The missionary strategy does seem to be a bit overwhelming, so I'd like to see some demonstrated balance before moving it up to a 9.

UPDATE: A strong soldier strategy is also impressive, and we had a balanced game.  Moving up to a 9.

RATING: 6.5
This game has it all. There are numerous paths to victory, but it seems easy to have 1 or 2 players jump way out ahead early on. Our games seem to come down to the last turn and who gets the preferred age 3 building. Maybe this is the intention of the designer, but there wasn't much tension as the leader had been way ahead from the get go. Worth playing more, but it's a long game.

A fun game, but seems like a pretty typical euro in the line of Leonardo da Vinci and Caylus: allocate workers to different areas, then resolve the areas to get the appropriate benefits. This game, however, is much more interesting than either of those: there is more going on but it's not overly complicated and it plays relatively quickly (with 4). The randomness of the order capitol buildings show up is a potential problem -- turn order (which you can fiddle with but which only takes effect the NEXT turn) may not allow you to purchase a useful one. My biggest quibble, though, is the production: the box is ginormous, has a LOT of empty space, and is a nonstandard size that won't stack well with any of our other games! Also, some of the colonists (peons and merchants) are a little hard to distinguish from each other quickly, and they don't fit on the score track -- a FEW wooden cubes/discs would have been nice!

There is nothing innovative here but what it does, it does well.  Very nice board and set up it looks pretty cool.  There are plenty of options and multiple paths to victory.

RATING: 7
Has the feel of a Eurogame, which is good and bad here.  The good is there are many interesting choices each round with your resource allocations.  On the other hand, I prefer a little more randomness in conflict resolution.  Here it feels a bit too mechanical for a game where you're discovering, conquering, and developing new lands.  There should be a bit more chance and risk of the unknown occurring.  Lastly, what is up with the board?  The spaces for each region should be much larger.  The spaces for placing your resources could be shrunk down instead.  I do like all those plastic pieces though.  Still, a fun game that I look forward to playing again.

RATING: 6
This game is a mixture between worker placement and area control.  Each turn players place their workers on a variety of different spaces that discover and populate parts of the "New World", collect trade goods, specialist workers, and battle opponents.

It can be compared to Dominant Species where worker placement is also used to manage the area control mechanics of a game.  I didn't really care for that game and I don't like this one much better.  I do like it a little better because it doesn't seem as abstract as Dominant Species.  The one slightly original mechanic of this game are the specialist workers that provide bonuses based on what action spaces they are placed in.

I think I just need to stop playing these older games so long after their release because I tend not to like them with a few exceptions.  Worker placement has been refined so much and knocked out of the park by so many games since this came out that this game just seems kind of bland and samey even if it was original at the time it was released.  Even the mechanic I labeled as "slightly original" where you can acquire different kinds of workers with special abilities has been done and done better by several other games since.

All in all this game was simply bland.  The worker placement piece, which with how much I like worker placement should have been my favorite piece, just seemed ancillary and unnecessary to the area control piece.  The special buildings you could buy didn't do anything very interesting and all of this made the game kind of bland.  The worst was that there was very little to do by the end game, especially the final turn.

It wasn't all bad though.  There are multiple legitimate paths to victory and lots of interesting decisions to make.  It's just not something that has stood the test of time.

Best with 3 or 4 for time of play and crowding issues, not 6! For a game that ends up with people with close scores in the 79-80 range, a minor mistake (miscalculating $ for building, or failing a discovery) which looses you 5-7 points is crippling. For such a long playing time, it seems like it is too easy to make an error which looses the game.

For now it's an 8. It could get higher but I don't think so. It's a very well produced game, apart from the scoring track, it is very well balanced in all the possible strategies, although I have some questions about the balance between the buildings. Some of them seem to be very unbalanced but that's something I have to prove by playing it a couple of times more.

It has luck envolved but I have to play it again to see if it is luckier than it should.

It is a bit unbalanced.
Maybe you have to play better than your opponents in order to win but I still have a doubt about buildings and their balance. I'll push it down to a 7.

At the time of writing, this is just below Dominant Species - fitting, because I prefer that game just a little more, but the two are comparable for how the rounds resolve, and how the game board changes dramatically with other players' actions. Have had a few really good games of this, not least the one with Fi and Brian (and a sleepy Liz!).

Very much liked after first game. Rating likely to go up. My trade goods strategy sucked. Superb game. Nice theme, production and many paths to victory with no single strategy dominant. Denial very important as is turn order, both of which i have neglected in first two plays. Do not like 6 player - Felt that turn order just too important and in the first turn really punishes 5th/6th players. 4 Player sweetspot?

I have a  love hate relationship with this game, as it sometimes falls v flat if you fighting over the same things and let a specialist run away

Last game noticed that the discovery is a bit of a lottery, not so much in ability to discover just what you get in terms of VP and cash when you do. 

Excited by expansion planned for Feb/March - the new capital builders and specailist looks like it will really spice up the game

Like the building additions in the expansion - they water down specialisation as you can't have any certainty as to what's coming up.

However after 11 plays I love the game a little less than after 5. It's a little long and repetitive for my 2013 tastes

....so ibacked the 2015 deluxe edition. Yeah when will i learn.

A great strategy game where every game is always different. There are many things to do to achieve ultimate victory: trade, exploration of new territories, building of pre-and battles. It looks complex, but the clarity of the regulation makes it very easy to learn and play. The things to do are well defined in each round of the players and the strategies adopted must always be different every game to obstruct opponents. Good materials and weave game, while the board could be slightly larger to allow better placement of the checkers game. The miniatures are not the greatest perfection, and often confuse those of the merchant and settler. Overall you are having fun and the length of matches is never long and frustrating. It's perfect for 4 players, while for 3 players is a bit more limited because you do not have time to discover all the territories, but have fun anyway. Highly recommended!

A nice worker placement game in the 'euro-style' or whatever. Relatively low level of randomness - basically what trade goods and purchasable buildings come out each turn.

I've played this game 3 times now with anywhere from 3 to 5 opponents.  I was initially unimpressed with the fact that it bore absolutely no resemblance to the AoE and AoE II computer games that I got addicted to in the past.  Then I realized what a really well-designed and beautifully-produced (other than the score track and the map regions) game it truly is, with many interesting choices that must be made each turn, a high level of competition between players,  multiple paths to victory, and the fact that it comes close to leaving me with a similar "narrative" feeling that I get after playing a large and long, conquer-the-world-style AT game.  (I'm sure this is partly due to the fact that it is designed by Glenn Drover, and partly due to the fact that it has a ton of plastic, including truly astonishing ships that bring to mind the "empty city" markers in Railroad Tycoon - ya gotta love Eagle Games.)  And THEN I realized that there is a certain element of excitement that is missing, and that, while it is still better than most large, Euro-style game I've played, I would have a lot more fun playing Age of Mythology.  So did they succeed in bringing the AoE computer games to 3-D life?  No.  Did they succeed in taking a tricky theme that incorporates many elements and turning it into a fairly fun, relatively simple yet challenging gaming experience?  Yes!  Game design: 4.5/10  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/10  Total: 7/10

This game is fun.  It's similar conceptually to Puerto Rico but offers more opportunity to interfere with what others are doing.  It also seems to have more possible paths to victory than PR does.

I sort of write of these war board games based on video games as too long, complicated, and clunky.. This one surprised me as being really not much war, fairly low luck and a lot of Euro-style mechanics.  Really didn't seem to use much of the video game mechanics at all.  I found the game to play a good pace, and overall be interesting and fun to play.  I am glad I give this one a chance would be happy to play it again.

A very pleasant surprise. A game with a name like AGE OF EMPIRES III just doesn't sound like it's going to be my kind of game at all. But it flowed very smoothly, had some very interesting decisions, and had a genuine thematic flavor. Sure there's luck, but most of the risks can be calculated. I don't understand the point of not scoring VPs until the end. Why not just score things when I get 'em? Open trackable information? :)

A fine job. It may not be for everyone, but it hit my sweet spot. One non-game related flaw -- the score track is a horror. Who approved that design?

Well into double figures on this game this is one of the best game that I have played. Hints of Puerto Rico, Caylus and a touch of Stuggle of Empires are combined into a perfect blend that feels much lighter than the sum of the parts have a right to be.

It's a gamer's game that does appeal to many non-gamers.

The only minor issue that I have is concerns the game start. Both the standard 'random start' and the 'advanced start' don't seem to appeal to many of the members in our group. 

I Havn't quite found a suitable alternative yet but I feel that bidding with VP's would be the best approach.

RATING: 7
This is easily Glenn Drover's best game; which isn't saying very much.
Actually, this is a surprisingly good euro-style game.  The theme is strong and the gameplay is pretty well refined.
Strangely enough, my largest complaint is with the production.  In typical Eagle Games (well in this case Tropical Games) style, the board is huge and lavishly decorated and the pieces are elaborate molded plastic figures (which, thankfully, we don't have to pry off of sprues this time).  They look fantastic.  Unfortunately they aren't very functional.  The different pieces are too difficult to distinguish from one another at a glance, they're constantly falling over, and the victory track around the board is almost unusable.  Victory tracks should be very clear and the pieces would have been much easier to use if they were simple wooden shapes (such as the ones used in Game of Thrones for instance).
My biggest gameplay complaint is that the discovery cards introduce just a bit too much luck in a game that otherwise is very strategic.
Neither of these complaints should be enough to deter you from trying what otherwise is a fine game.

RATING: 7
A good game, with mechanisms slightly similar to Caylus or Maestro Leonardo, but it avoids the bean-counter feeling I get with those two games, perhaps through having a richer theme, perhaps by having what feels like a greater variety in its ways of earning victory points. Played with 3, 4, 5 and 6 players, and enjoyed every game.

Now, having said that, there are issues. I'd rather use pencil & paper than the scoretrack, the New World colonies are too small, it's easy to make mistake in identifying figures, it's normally too expensive/counter-productive to take a trade-good or capital building just to stop someone else getting it, first-turn capital buildings can be a gift for the player randomly drawn to go first (I'm looking at you, Mr "take $20"), competing for merchant ships normally revolves around looking to see how many pieces a player has left to place, and I haven't yet seen anyone win whose main strategy was scoring in the colonies.

RATING: N/A
A very good euro-game with an essential random element and nice figures instead of cubes. I like AoEIII because of its theme (conquering the New World) that you can strongly feel during playing. The mechanics is decent, there are some distinct paths to the victory. There is a significant interaction between players, your opponents can press you very strongly, but they cannot smash you. To win the game, you need to observe your enemies and not be stuck to a single tactic. Sometimes, we use AoE to introduce new people into the boardgame world and the opinions are mostly very positive. Personally, I'm always playing with a pleasure.

The main game drawback: the box is really huge, it's difficult to transport it to my friends. It could be twice smaller, at least.

Number of plays: about 17.

Jó kis játék ez! Nagyon jól működik a Worker placement rész, ahogy meg kell küzdeni a jó helyekért. Az amerikai kolonizáció pedig a szokott többségi mechanizmus, egyszerű háborúskodás, lapka-kombináció-gyűjtés. De mindez remekül össze van rakva, jól működik.

A great game with a fully engaged theme.  It's a 10.  Easy to teach, easy to play.  Tons of strategy and fun.

update : This is just a damned fine game.  Scales brilliantly from 2 +.  It has great long term strategy mixed with just enough randomness to make it competitive for all.

Also expansion : The Builders

Raising value for this game. Everything looks fine: mechanics, graphic, components... may be too much! :) Plenty of choiches (4 players game, dunno if true in 5 or six) for your strategy. The only problem is the final phase, where the game seems to slow down too much. It could suffer the kingmaker factor.

270709 - Gave a 8.5 ratings to the game based on a 2-player game. AOE presents itself as a thematic game with wonderfully multiple streams of scoring techniques. It perphaps plays even better with more players. A good game that uses the simple worker-placement mechanism without the blandness of one.

RATING: 7.5
So many viable paths to victory make this a truely great game. Everytime I've played, I've experimented with different strategies and clearly there is not one that will work every time.

It is possible for people to get left behind and missing out on the 1 or 2 Age 3 buildings you need can be crippling which maybe knocks it down slightly for me...

Update: Dan and Nato seem to have broken this game with money strategies and as such this hasn't hit the table in a while. Need to try it again to see if I still love it.

RATING: 7
Over time, this game has fallen by the wayside.  The Area Control is much to fixed to be interesting as once colonists are sent to the new world, not much changes.

The Worker Placement over and over seem to be driven by turn order, in that most of the time, people are going after the same things each round, and only their placement in turn order is what keeps it.  

It is better with the bid for starting player order to take away the rush for the turn 1 capital buildings, and some of the capital buildings are just plain overpowered while others end up being quite weak.

It's also not too quick a game either, and for just a little longer, you can play Dominant Species, which has rendered Age of Empires III obsolete in my opinion.

The first playing went over quite smoothly and we all discussed things that we might have done different, which is always a good sign for a game IMHO.  It lands among a pile of other games that would probably be grabbed at random - not enough to rise to the top, but good enough to pull out on occasion.

Downgraded as it is just lost in the euro crowd.  Other games seem to scratch the itch a bit better.  Nice, just not enough against the competition. 5/11/10

Worker placement and area control. You can send your worker on the initiative track (the next players will earn hear more money), on the dock (he goes on the main board), take goods (gives you money),to the ship (joker good), buy a building (helps you in the game and some bring points), make a discovery (points and money), take a specialist (4 different, better than standard colonist) and declare agression/war.

Buildings are important, but the`re expensive (you have not much money). The most important is the majority in the regions on the board and making discoveries (you can risk). 

Your colonist and specialists are miniatures. The problem is some of them looks similar, so you must ask the other players what person they have left or on the board. On the board there is not so much place in the regions. The game is long. Good game, but nothing special.

Interesting worker placement game where you try to colonise the New World. Cynthia and I got into this very easily and played 3 games in 2 days!

03-09-08: Played a 5-player at the game club and it took 2.5 hours. Things learnt: 1) the game takes 30 minutes per player. 2) It's an AREA CONTROL game with a WORKER PLACEMENT mechanic, emphasizing AREA CONTROL. Players were confused halfway through the game over what to do.

I had my eyes on this game for a while and finally got a chance to play it one evening.  I was sorely disappointed.

I played a 6-player game and it was boring, Boring, BORING.  95% of the game is placing worker after worker.  The other 5% is playing around with the plastic pieces while you wait forever as other people place their workers.

RATING: 9
Excellent game that itches a lot of the right spots for me. I really like that there are multiple ways to be successful in the game and I especially like that the strategy you pick is often based on how the board starts out and what everyone else does too. My only real complaint is that the last round of buildings can really skew the game if you don't get one that benefits you as much as the building helping the next guy. I also dislike the random draw of the discoveries - I'd rather play with them face up. This plays pretty decently with varied number of players, but you really have to solidify your strategy when there are more players.

RATING: 8
Now reimplemented as the mouthful, [thing=173442][/thing], on first blush I found this game bland. I sarcastically thought, "Oh joy. Another worker placement game with a seafaring /settlement theme. How novel." Upon multiple plays, however, this game really started to grow on me. It shines with 3 or more players. You need to learn how all of the different strategies work together before you can play effectively. The warfare element really puts it over the top and adds a lot of tension because a player can subvert another player's pure building strategy.

Component-wise, this game has always been a bit overblown and outsized. The board is big, the pieces are plastic miniatures, and even the box is large. Too large. I just don't have the patience these days for enormous boxes. I want to be able to transport my games to game night for frequent use. With a large box, the likelihood of me playing a game more than occasionally goes way down. After spotting the box for the reimplementation, wow, it seems I'm in the minority because the new edition is bigger and heavier. Shame. It's a game worth playing, but it's not one I want to lug around.

Updated: I think I was influenced by the hype. The game is surprisingly monotonous. Not that interesting. Lowered the rating to 6.5
Updated: While I still like it in 4, in 2 it's hard to catch up if you're behind at the start. I also don't like that the soldier strategy is useless. Lowered it to 8.

First impression(4p): Complex, interactive game. The game has a lot of moving parts and a number of administrative tasks to keep track of. But the player interaction and the number of actions available make the time fly.

I quite liked this, but strangely, while I'm a  big Caylus fan, I didn't get the same feeling from Age of Empires III (the two are often compared with each other, and AoE is apparently considered to have borrowed heavily from Caylus). Other than both being worker-placement games, I just didn't see that many similarities. In any event, other than the often-discussed flaws that the score track is fiddly (at least on my first-edition copy) and that the pieces are difficult to tell apart (I may get ambitious and paint them), I found AoE III to be quite interesting and challenging. Each placement is usually a difficult decision, and multiple strategies seem to yield good results. For me, that's a pretty good formula for a fun game.

Worker placement game meets area control while you vie to colonize the new world to your countries benefit.  The worker placement mechanic functions in a manner similar to Dominant Species meaning all workers/colonists are placed on a track to the right side of the map, and then those functions are processed affecting the main player board/map.  Not as confusing to follow the board play when compared to Dominant Species, and all in all just a fun game.

Age of Empires is 70% Euro, 30% Ameritrash.  The euro mechanics are all velvety smooth: layer cake upon layer cake of special powers and silky conversions.  And bolted onto the left side of the board is this clunky mini-game of Risk.  The two don't mesh, and as it stands, the whole thing just doesn't hold my interest.

RATING: 9
What a great blend of already great games (Caylus, Puerto Rico,Pillars of the earth) spiced up with mechanics that superbly transfer the theme to bring you the perfect boardgame cocktail. The stress is on cocktail as opposed to longdrink. The first game took us 2 Hours including explanation I like tons of options and this game really delivers. Probably even better with 4  players.I expect warfare to play a more crucial part in such a game compared to this 3-player-session. Personally I am very delighted about the plastic figures. Those are why cubes and meeples wish to be reborn as a plastic miniature in their next lives. What especially stunned me in this particular game was the very close endgame with a final score of 88 over 86 and 85 points and all three of us pursuing a different strategy throughout the game. Speaks for a good balance and thoroughly game testing, so when playing again I will pay attention as to if this will occur again.

Update: While the scores had a wider range this time, everything was in balance until the very end. 
     

Slight criticism which has nothing to do with the game itself: From a game this scope (~ 50 euros) I expect player aids and ziplock bags or some sort of prefit tray for all those plastic pieces.

A pretty Euro that is simple to play, gives a good feel for multiple paths to victory games, and manages to do many things fairly well.

UPDATE:  Though I have not tracked all my playings, I have played this many times in the past year or so, leading to a bit of burn out.  It is an OK game, but it can get a bit stale after so many playings.  That and Justin keeps winning with his warmonger strategy--boo, no fun!

Okay, now we've played a real, full length game. Wow. What a game. It outdoes even the top games in it's area. Probably one of the best new games I've played. Deep, yet easy to play. Lots of different strategies. Doesn't suffer from "optimization" like Puerto Rico does. So many possible routes to winning, but not overwhelmingly so. I could see myself playing this for a loooooong time. Still not my number one absolute favorite, but I have the feeling that ten years from now, I'll still be up for a game.

A really good mix that fits well for several of the gamer types I play with.  The game offers a variety of strategies and values initiative (turn order) but not overly so.  Plenty of opportunity to take risks or play it safe, to get into pissing matches or to back off, and to specialize in any number of areas.  Not enough battle to be a "take that" game, but plenty to satiate those who "just want to kill something".  And for those of us who would rather avoid conflict, there's some ability to get out of the way.

Described by certain people in my circle as "the child of numerous other games."  It's got a little bit of El Grande-style territory control, a bit of worker placement, a bit of set collecting.

RATING: 7
A euro with a great theme, aka modern boardgame design, with surprisingly strong interaction.

A lot of available rewarding strategies to follow, a lot of interaction (it's a worker placement with area control), great theme, good sense of accomplishment and tough decisions create a very tense and enjoyable game.

Although the area control element is very well implemented, it's still something I personally do not enjoy very much. War, even though it opens a lot of strategic options and boosts up interaction still opens up kingmaking. The expeditions, though excellent from a thematic point of view, create risk in an otherwise luck free and tight strategy game.

Overall Age of Discovery is a game that has stood surprisingly well the test of time. It's still a great game to play, and offers some of the best of both worlds (strategy and theme)

This game was a blast to play! I think i'm starting to realize how much i enjoy worker placement games especially if it has multiple paths to victory. The board is great however i'm not a huge fan of the plastic pieces...it gets a little confusing with some of them (although i guess its better than cardboard pieces) and i'm very disappointed in the size of the box as well as the support the box has. I bought this game brand new and already i feel like the box is falling apart. The only game that i have bought brand new that seems to do this.

RATING: 9
Simply put this is the best of the Eagle Games line...oh wait this is by TROPICAL GAMES...that makes it different right? Whatever, now let's talk the game.  So my only real gripe is it seems to take longer to play it than I think it should...I'm not sure why.  We even did pretty good with keeping focused on who's turn it was.  I'm not saying this game drags so don't read it like that, it just takes a solid 2 hours to play this game and it seems like it should be quicker.  It's not boring and I know I'm making it seem like this is bad but I felt I needed to say it.  Now the game itself is awesome.  Full of very tough choices.  It's a beautiful system that feels good in this theme too.  Just the right amount of randomness in the random resource tiles, and buildings coming out each turn and then the random exploration tiles/cards.  Lots of paths to victory so game play style can be custom to each player.  Very fun game can't wait to play it again.

Addendum:
I had been thinking this game might creep into the coveted 10 spot but now I don't believe that will happen.  After several more games it seems the missionary may be a bit too powerful.  We've now seen this tactic take a run away lead multiple times. If this is the case in future plays I think I'll end up lowering my rating for the game. I find this a bit ironic because it seems to me that people (myself included) in their first few games gloss over the power of the missionary and focus on other specialists.  Read through these comments and you'll see what I mean.  The big focus in our group didn't come up until we'd been playing for several games.  There is dissension amongst us as to whether or not he's over powered but we have agreed to give it a few more run through's and see what pans out.

Scoring mainly comes from area majority. That means it's terrible with fewer than at least 4.

This was one of the better worker placement games of the past couple years.  The worker placement genre is certainly a crowded field these days with every other gaming seemingly using that mechanism since Caylus was released 3 years ago.  However, AOE3 was interesting and engaging.  The components were definitely over the top, especially the merchant ships, and the plastic pieces were actually harder to distinguish than simpler components would have been, not to mention the enormous board which is very much unnecessarily large, but despite all that, I found myself enjoying this one and the interesting decisions that it presented.

The rules as written make a missionary strategy virtually unbeatable.  The military rules are much too restrictive and therefore make the most fun approach to the game a guaranteed failure.

RATING: 5.5
Started playing. First impression is no way. Too many tiny decisions (as pieces to allocate), many of which are destined for thematically dissatisfying subsystems with little player interaction. Inconsistent whether your "people" income represents people or just their labor. Discovery seems like a scary crapshoot (unless you spend a lot on it). I will probably make up house rules to simplify this game

...Raise from 4 to 5... But it is a lot of work. You will have spent a lot of time calculating income from sets or partial sets of trade goods. That component is not much fun, not very interactive, doesn't tell a story. House rules need to change the balance of the mechanisms so that a better story is likely to be told and less time is spent on dull things.

...Raise to 5.5 because I like to try playing simplified variants. I do think that I learned something from this game. I don't think it's a [i]clever[/i] design, but I feel I can clearly imagine the thought process that went into it.

...But I just can't get over how the New World is on one side of the board and most of the game is on the other!

This is a solid game with plenty of replayability. Thoughtful play, but it moves quickly. So many different strategies and tweaks. I keep wondering if I will tire of it but after my last 2 plays I still am amazed at how good this plays.

Gameplay is phenomenal, a few strikes against it as components have a couple problems: poor scoring track, plastic models are too similar to each other, etc. Like Railroad Tycoon, all this technical stuff doesn't get in the way of just having a great time while playing. Intense enough that I almost always end up standing up looming over the board.

I will be happy playing this one for many years.

Got to playtest two games with Keith from Eagle Games and while it still needs some tweaking, it looks like a game I will have to buy when it comes out.
Got to play another 2 games with a few tweaks to the game and it looks better and better.  
There's a great difference in gameplay between a 4 player game and with 5 or 6 which I think will be a good thing since it'll greatly increase the replayability of the game.  However, that could be just because everyone but one player tried a very different strategy in the 4 player game right after playing a 5 player game.
Got in another game with new rules relating to WAR and VPs for economy and it's a HUGE improvement.

Finally played the finished version and the game is a 10!  Tough decisions every turn and not enough actions to do everything you want.  Scales well between the number of players and easy to learn, but lots of possibilities for strategies and replays.

First impressions

Pros
- subtle ways to use the upgraded workers, which became more apparent as the game went on. 

Cons
- Discovery action is luck-driven. You could get money and VPs - or you may not depending on a cardflip. Matters in a long game like this, and not very satisfying.
- Some mechanics now feel a little played out - set collecting goods, turn order jostling, persistent building powers. A bit yawn. 
- Multiple dudes on a map is just a horrible UI for me to see and process 
- Some worker spaces felt a bit tacked on or inherently less competitive/desirable.

Age of Empires is a solid worker placement game that has a touch of War to make it less passive than a typical Euro.  There is nothing amazing here that makes it stand out from the crowded class of similar games in the current environment, except for the minis, especially the boats!  Having only played with four it seems like it would scale up better than down.  With any less players the game would lose some tension because very little of the worker placement options disappear to compensate for less workers to place.  On the other hand, turns move fast so there would be minimal down time even with six (if you include expansion).  As a somewhat more interactive competitive Euro it will hold a solid place in any collection that needs to facilitate a larger gaming group.

RATING: 8
Really fun.  As a man who likes Caylus well enough, but loves AT, this game scratches a very particular itch quite well.  In fact, I can't see myself playing much Caylus outside of BSW, since this takes the core worker placement mechanism, gives you something more fun to do than build some guy's castle, and has oodles of plastic.

It plays fast, yet offers lots of room for decision-making.  People say that capital buildings are over-powered, but I think that they're just powerful, and since they're the only thing you can really spend money on other than a wildcard specialist, you need to incorporate the purchase of at least a few capital buildings into your plan, but I don't think that they're a dominant strategy.

A couple of plays now and this gets better the more you get to know it. Fantastic!!.  So many choices with different ways to win and yet so well balanced.  There are obviously some killer combinations in the development options (privateers followed by a Navy for example) and capital buildings, so the depth will be in the tactical choices.

Decision upon decision.  Feels like Puerto Rico, but somehow more engaging to the uninitiated and with a couple more systems (like soldiers!).

Loving it...

Age of Empires III is a heavier strategy game than most, although it doesn't require too much thought to get into. However, it may be the best strategy game I've ever played with six players (Dune may be an exception) and certainly has no downtime and a good, flowing feel. Glenn Drover has produced some good games in the past, although he has certainly taken flak for his earlier games. He won't receive much for this one, however; as it is a fantastic game of discovery, marrying theme with good mechanics for a tremendously solid, fun game. See my review for more details...

RATING: 10
While the rulebook is vague on some points, and so are the tiles, and the scoring track around the board is the worst one ever in the history of gaming, the game itself is a very challenging area control affair.  The new iteration has some bells and whistles in terms of its storage insert and player boards, also having the Builder expansion worked in, but its retail price is just not commensurate with the scope of the game, so this earlier version is just fine with me.  I consider it to be fairly thematic, and while the structure of placement and resolution might seem odd at first, you get used to it.  I rated it at 10 because it takes El Grande and evolves upon its basic premise, creating not an entirely new game, but certainly a refinement upon El Grande's design and intent.

This is a great game. I cannot believe that I never played it before now. It is like a cross between a majority and a worker placement game, but with all the player interactivity that I can handle. Sending soldiers to the colonies and reducing the number of your opponents' colonists by means of war has got to be a first in what is decidedly a euro game. There are just so many options where you can spend your workers on: Discoveries, trade goods, trade good jokers, building tiles, etc., etc. I also like the fact that the rules are pretty straightforward, so you can start playing after only a short explanation. Definitely a keeper!

RATING: 7
A medium-to-heavy weight worker placement game that I feel, successfully blends different elements of the PC game into a board game version. Players put down colonists in different categories each round to nab roles to improve the expansion of an empire in the New World and beyond. Mainly, players can pursue different tracks to obtain victory points. I found that even though worker placement games can be rather abstract, there are clearly pathways to specialize your empire so you can accumulate wealth, accelerate discoveries of new territories, improve economic wealth by improving cities and buildings, expand territories either by conquest with armies or by spreading the gospel via missionaries. These subtle routes to victories really capture the taste and flavor of the game. A very well designed albeit slightly overproduced game.

RATING: 4
First of all, I just plain don't like the action drafting mechanic, so this game wasn't made for me in the first place, but still, I can appreciate, if not love, games like Caylus or Puerto Rico where the mechanic is well-implemented and has a clever and interesting game built around it. AoE3 just seems poorly conceived. The Area Control is brutal, so much so that in a 5-player game it seems to be best to stay out of the colonies entirely, except to pick up trade goods, which themselves are a stupid part of the game. They're "trade" goods, but you can't trade them! Finally, that the randomness of the Discoveries is ridiculous goes without saying, so I won't mention it, but the randomness of which buildings and trade goods come up and when is also quite silly.

In sum, I think this game just proves that quote from the Good Book: "Render to the Germans the games that are German, and to the Americans the games that are American." This is a Euro without all the mechanical interaction and fine-tuning that make the best Euros great, and as an American game, it's as dull as dirt, as it severely lacks in drama.

Oh and also, way too long. And I haven't even addressed the physical design.

[b]+1[/b] for having orange as a player color. [b]-1[/b] for no trading. Many tough choices throughout a turn, and though there seems to be some strategy present, with more plays, it becomes apparent that it's just prettily dressed luck (unfortunately). Fans of [gameid=181] (or [gameid=3076] for that matter) should make the switch to this.. still, it's one of my favorite worker placement/area majority games, but I'd never play with more than four.. too tight/too long.

Fingers crossed, hoping the new edition addresses the minor problems with the old.

Recommended with 2, 3, and 4, if you must (and on the requirement all know how to play well).
If you're a fan, I recommend [gameid=21920], but lay off the booze.. it's a little brainier.

I very much enjoy this game.  One of the few games that had a lot of hype surrounding its release that has lived up to the hype.  There's enough going on that you always want to do twice as much as you're allowed to do.  Need to balance income, exploration, development, and warfare, all while making sure that you're still on good footing for the future.  Everything demands your attention [i]right now[/i], because that spot for your worker probably won't be around for your next turn.  The components and graphical presentation are top notch, and the gameplay is vicious.  A very flexible game, that can be satisfying with gamers of all stripes.  A little lengthier than many games of its type, but time flies while you're playing it.

(7/09)  Still like the game - plays quick even with newbies.  The merchant ship box seems to be the "conflict area" with guns/soldiers being more viable with more than 4 players.

(2008)  Very enjoyable game.  Might be a good next step after the "gateway" games.  Money is a key part of this game - make sure you understand how to get it (merchant colonization, set collection of goods, initiative, buildings, etc).   Seem to be a lot of different ways to victory - area control, discovery, set collection, etc.  Make sure you familiarize yourself with the upcoming ages buildings - age III = a lot of victory point conditions which you can build toward throughout the game.  Enjoyed this much more than Sid Meier's Civilization.

This is a very interesting - and a very good - worker placement game.  Its strength is that it has a ton of pieces, there are a lot of things going on at once, and players are going to be occupied pretty much constantly by the ever flowing pace of the game.  However, because it is a "heavier" worker placement game, it tends to turn off newer players and/or those that do not prefer to play with worker placement mechanics.

So, the game does some things right -- it's nice to see the warfare and area control aspects of the game that prevent it from being just another worker placement game, and I like the way the different kinds of people give you different benefits -- but unfortunately, those extra things aren't really to my tastes.  Area control is something I've never grokked, and I tend to feel more frustrated than anything else when I play them.  Warfare is very understated in the game, but it's still something I dislike, and let's not even speak of the buildings that allow players to get extra stuff every turn.  Those are fine until you get to the last age or so, when the difference between one and another is huge.  So while it's not a game that I would turn down, it's not one I'm going to be asking to play, either.

Nothing new in this game, but it does provide a clever integration of previous designs. The game is fun, tense, and quick to play after the first go. It's not as good as Puerto Rico, but I suspect it has nearly the same legs (after three plays, the game does not scale as well as PR; it seems optimized for three to four players; five is just too much, haven't tried with two yet). The production values are overproduced: we could have had this game in a box half the size, but the production is also helpful and sensible. All the pieces are well thought out, the board has helpful information in the right places.

It is the late 15th century and a new age is dawning. While searching for a new trade route to India, explorers have discovered a new land. The first reports tell of strange creatures, exotic people, and fabulous wealth. Captains and dventurers flock to these new lands in search of gold. They are quickly followed by colonists, soldiers, merchants, and missionaries all seeking wealth of one kind or another. Colonies begin to spring up, and soon competition among the great nations of Europe begins.
\13\ \13\
Take the role of one of Europe's colonial powers and stake your claim in the New World. As the leader of your nation, there are many paths that lead to victory: Discover and colonize new lands; acquire trade goods that will build your economy; develop new technologies and infrastructure in your home country; build your merchant fleet to dominate the trade routes; and build your army to defend what is rightfully yours!

I know that it's not even remotely original and that every single mechanism featured in the game has been repurposed from some other classic Euro. Hell, even the name was stolen, since Age of Empires III the computer game has absolutely nothing in common with the game found in this box. That being said, those stolen mechanisms work together like a finely tuned machine. Featuring aggressive player interaction and multiple paths to victory, AoE III does almost everything right.

The only misstep is the discovery system, which is blind, random and basically completely out of line with the rest of the game's zero-luck, deterministic nature. To me that's only a minor quibble though, as it's still possible to play conservatively and guarantee success. Of course if you stop and think about it, the game is about sailing off blindly into the unknown, so a little uncertainty in this particular facet of the game is probably justified.

It's one of my favorites, especially now that the expansion has added nation specific powers, which have added a ton of flavor and few new strategies to the mix.

An excellent mix of techniques involving various eurogames. While playing this game one could have vivid memories of Puerto Rico. It's simpler than Puerto and more "visual" in its approach while not loosing in strategic depth and micromanagment.

I liked my first experience and look forward to playing it again; however there were certain elements within that seemed to be not well tested or developed. Particularily there is a card which when selected in the first age provides a three-for-one monetary advantage.

First play, very promising! If you colonize be sure to have enough colonists/soldiers. We've played with the 3+ discoveries only. Many strategies to follow, cash flow is important for buying buildings. More plays to come...

Second game (5 players again) we played with the discovery tiles open, was well received!

Different strategies possible, the economic aspect of the game is important, don't neglect this! Close finish, will be played again!

A nice solid Euro worthy of finally seeing print, with (gasp) plastic bits.  Still this plays well with plenty of options on how to obtain your points.  The box is overproduced for the size of the game board and what's in it.  Maybe there was an excess of old Eagle Games boxes.

One bad experience: luck element in the discovery. the random element can make a big outcome in the game.

Nice light empire building / trading game.  Much more of a Euro than an empire building game but I still enjoy it.  One question: Where is the warfare?  I know you are allowed to buy infantry but who does?  Fighting is a big part of the PC game, it was really lost in this translation.

Just saw the huge box in Drexoll's...and it now looks like it's come home with me.  Fancy that...Finally won a game.  Yes, money is important. Not being able to buy anything is very sad (sniff!).   But building up an economy is pretty tough - you really have to rely on buildings, although now that we are playing the specialist track properly merchant income is good too.  Plus,  in a 2er game,  there's a billion things to track.  Must try with more...The bits are very nice looking,  but could have had a couple more passes to clean things up - close but no cigar.  Spaces on the board are just a touch small,  the VP track could be a touch larger,  there could be spaces on the board for the buildings and the auction...It's just the board is so big,  it feels like there was potential for so much more useful stuff to be put on it.  In the 2er games,  we haven't yet had a chance to discover from the deck.  Slowly getting a bit more...The pieces are different,  but I wish they were different enough to be distinguished from across the table.  All of them are human shaped blobs from afar - clothes are all a blur,  and the little trinkets (guns, bags of gold, etc.) are far too small if they're not right in front of you.  Maybe they should have been done in different poses.  So far,  I'm optimistic...and it's already well within the top 100...Finally played this with all the rules right:  before, we forgot to limit the size of the colonist dock,  and confused the $5 for any specialist to mean charge $5 to get a specialist.  Playing it correctly made it even better (especially since I squeaked in a win!)  Still want to play with 6 players - must be crazy ultra nasty!

This is a very nice, fast-paced worker-placement game. The figures (workers) are just non-functional and ruin the elegance of the game mechanics. There are 4 different types of specialist figures and they are extremely hard to distinguish, although it is crucial to do so. It's almost like the component designers were determined to screw up this great game.

Added 2013: I think Lords of Waterdeep is very similar and arguably superior to this game.

One of the best games I've played. Scales well from 4-6. 7 is a bit too tight and 3 doesn't have any blocking. The 4 player game can be an excellent gateway game and the 5-6er is good for more experienced gamers. A game that can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone old enough to play.

RATING: 5
The game is better than previous Drover designs, but ultimately very flawed. Money is the name of the game, and Discovery is the least worthwhile option. Too random. In a wargame, a bad die roll can hurt, but if it's one die roll amonst a ton of them, eventually things will even out. Here, you can plan your expedition for two turns (that's one fourth of the game!) and make sure you can beat the natives... and then you draw the poor man's discovery tile and don't get the reward you should have gotten for all your efforts. And that's unacceptable. Unless you admit that Discovery is NOT the way to go. Buildings are also unbalanced, which will hurt a lot when you've made sacrifices to go first next turn... and then the "weak" buidings pop out. Or when you've accepted to go last... and then the very best buildings come up. And it's not like, say, Puerto Rico, where every building can be just as valuable as the next one, depending on your situation: in Age of Empires, some buildings are ALWAYS better. And that's not good design. For instance, buildings that provide additional colonists/specialists are obviously overpowered. They give you more "actions" per turn, and they also help you get the last word (place the last colonist on the board). The more actions you get, the more actions you can fight to get, and the wheel keeps turning. Next to that, who cares about a building that gives you +1 soldier when you're attacked? It also makes the competition for the merchant ship very moot: few people will "risk it" when they see that one opponent still has a pile of colonists to play. The more I think about it, the more this feels like Risk: the rich get richer and it's very hard (impossible?) to tilt the scales. I would play it again, I suppose, but I would never ask for it myself.

RATING: 8
Very interesting game. Rules seem complicated at the beginning but a couple of turns are enough to understand what's going on. Many different strategies seem valuable to make points. A good knowledge of the capital buildings is essential to plan strategy. very very good material.
The only true downside is the excessive length of the game.
The combination of different specialist seems quite well balanced.

This title has a lot going on, though is very similar to Caylus.  There's a huge difference playing this game with a small number of people versus playing with a large number of people.  I find that with 6 people the game has a lot of contention and can be quite difficult.  With fewer players there's less contention and the game is easier.  I like that the player always has nice choices, and can adapt a strategy to go with what's happening.

RATING: 8
I enjoy this game.  It has great components, but to me what makes this a playable game, not buried in a lot of details, is the game board.  The design of the board is fantastic.  It lays everything out in logical fashion, so that it's very easy to see what your choices are, when everything takes place, etc.  Without this gameboard design, I'd have no interest in playing this because I wouldn't be able to keep track of everything.

I also like that there's many different valid strategies.  Lots of decisions to be made.

The main thing that holds me back from rating it higher is the game length, and of course that's very subjective.  For my tastes, for this time in my life, I'm less likely to suggest this than some other games which are just as fun, just as nice-looking, but play in a shorter amount of time.

UPDATE:  I think I wrote the above after 1, maybe 2 plays.  I've since played it more (not all of my plays are entered in the BGG database), and either the game plays faster with my familiarity with it, or it doesn't bother me now.  I've upped my rating, and maybe it should be a tad higher still.

Board game adaptation of the video game series. One of the first 4X worker placements for area control.  Has a distinct war game feel with cutthroat interaction. Distinct classic worker actions to colonize the New World provinces by displacing the indigenous populations. Interesting mechanic of refreshing pool of workers and timing when to buy the one time use of a special worker. Typical euro to build your economy, leverage the bonus building tiles to pay for expansion of colonies for victory points, sprinkle in some battles with your neighbors for control of a region. With plenty of opportunity to burn or be burned in negotiation.

Great fun. But most of the action is set-collection-like, so I'm not as excited as I'd hoped.

Unfortunately, the spatial aspect is not that important.

Definitely underdeveloped.  Why offer a first-to-place bonus for most other actions, but not for the discovery box?  There seem to be some missed opportunities here.

Potentially a very good game, regardless.  What spoils the mood is the broken Monastery/Cathedral combo.  My auto-pick is to choose the Monastery if it is available, and that's just boring.

It's possible to block the combo, but only if someone is willing to take a hit for the team and therefore guarantee their own loss.  For this reason, I rarely play anymore.  Here's hoping that the expansion (real, or just a dream?) fixes things up.

Played twice (with 4 and 5 players). I had high expectations for this game, which might explain why I am so disappointed. First of all, the components are not too good - the board is inconvenient (scoring track, small areas in the New World, no space for buildings and trade goods), the plastic bits would be ok, I guess, if trader/settler and captain/soldier were not so easily confused, and the box itself is flimsy. That wouldn't be too much of a concern if I actually enjoyed the game - but it seems to have too many weak points for that. The balance of the buildings is doubtful (early cash is worth a lot); the randomness of the buildings and trade goods draw means that playing for turn order is a gamble (no need to waste a turn to be first if there is nothing especially interesting or urgent to do); not all of the late buildings are going to appear in a game, meaning that some players might not have the ones really useful for their strategy (a possible 20% shift to their final score - much above what I can stand in a game that long); and the discovery phase... well, it is random, but I can live with the risk-taking and the possible loss of several units - but the random part which I really do not like, however, is that a guaranteed successful discovery, with several soldiers, could pay back anywhere between 5 and 20 doubloons, which definitely makes a difference.
On the other hand, I am not too bothered by the fact there are actually very few new mechanisms - it is just a pity that they haven't been integrated and balanced a bit better.

I can play this with my non-gamer wife and 7-year-old son or I can play it with gamers.  The game flows quite easily for everyone I've played it with.  The game worked great for us as a family game.  There is definitely some luck in the discovery process, but I think that works very well thematically.  Seems to have the right amount of luck to balance out over the game.  It's a bit odd that almost all the scoring happens at the end.

I've made a custom map for the game that has larger holding boxes for the New World and a larger, more readable victory point track.  This improves the game.

Keith of Eagle Games brought the prototypes to a few of our club meetings for some playtesting. The game plays like Caylus meets El Grande with an old AH/SPI Conquistador theme. Game plays in 2 hours, but the 3 different ages keep the gameplay constantly evolving. Fan's of Martin Wallace should like this as the resources are tight, balanced choices are many, and the competition is fierce (with a small sprinkling of "attack the leader" via soldiers to keep the end score tight) - but if you hate random [i]post action[/i] exploration card results (and I've seen enough Railroad Tycoon threads to know that some people do) you might want to modify the rules some either playing them face up or discarding the extreme cards from play beforehand (fortunately the most extreme ones are in the early game giving time for counter strategies to trim off some game leaders score). 

Update: Have played the released version now and the minis and board art really help to evoke the theme. I did (but others in our groups didn't) have some problems telling the difference between merchant and colonist figures from the far end of the table. I might replace the colonists with a set of wooden cubes or glass beads in future plays. Or perhaps the answer is to do what is done with the missionaries and add a colonist along with any unit that is worth two units (e.g. when I add a captain to the merchant ship I also add a colonist from my unused supply with that captain and count each as one unit)

Bueno pues tras la primera partida he de decir que es un juego que me ha gustado. Es dinámico, sencillo y entretenido. A simple vista parece un juego de estrategia simple, pero que va, ofrece una profundidad y variedad a la hora de abordar la estrategia que te lleve a la victoria muy amplia. Un título recomendable si señor, y perfecto paso de entreda a juegos como Caylus y Puerto Rico.

{ P - 3 [4] 5 6 }

Worker placement done right. Paths to victory range from economic (trade goods, A3 buildings) to territorial (area control, exploration) with plenty of intermingling to balance a mixture of the two elements against outright specialization. (Example, some A3 buildings give points for new world presence, exploration leads to the acquisition of trade goods.) For added complexity workers can upgrade to specialists that perform more efficiently in two different functions. Buildings typically posit interesting dilemmas between points + single-use payoffs or annuity benefits. (The clunkers: Stables is pointless and should be removed. Cathedral is pretty linear because the only person who might want it is the guy who got the missionary building earlier. Migration - see below.) The randomness is a little irksome. It's not fun to be heavily naval and never see Privateers, collect sugar and never see Rum Distillery, or pick up an early gold and not see another until late A2. We play with two small changes:

[b]Migration on Bottom[/b]: This building at best moves you from second place to first in a colony. 4 VP. Worst building in A3. At least Militia is useful on a case-by-case basis. If this flops as part of the first five buildings (50% chance) of A3 and nobody buys it, during the last turn you only get four new buildings. Thus, one building is never available to buy. This kills whole strategies if that building just happens to be Power, Navy, Prosperity, Glory, or Mercantilism. Good players plan early-middle strategies around these buildings; no reason to let chance keep one on the sidelines. Easier to just put Migration on the bottom. Then if Militia is in the first set and nobody purchases it, Migration is the building that doesn't see play. Oh darn.

[b]Exploration Tiles are 3's and 4's[/b]: Not sure why there is so much variance on these. Nobody sends one or two guys on an expedition. Sending five is a pretty bad idea as well because the odds are substantially in your favor that four will succeed, and early game that extra guy is huge. But if you're the unlucky fellow who encounters what could be the only 5 on the board ... you probably just lost because failed expeditions tend to do that. Also, there's no good reason to have such a variance between how much each soldier can earn. Makes sense that so many people who play the game want to change just this aspect.

RATING: 9.75
Simply the best worker placement out there IMO. I love the fact that it has specialized roles yet you can clearly win the game without using any of them at all.

Great player interaction, scales incredibly well, easy enough to learn - but tons of strategic options and multiple paths to victory.  Every turn you have spots you "really want" to get which are taken up by other players.  This dynamic alone sets it apart from much of the competition due to the level of interactivity.

This game doesn't get its due because of the fact that it is ameritrash.  

.25 away from a 10 if it had better miniatures and smaller money pieces.  One of my top 3 games.

This is a fun game - we played it a lot when I first got it but my group has moved on to other things... not sure why .. and we don't play it as often. I think we are more into conflict games that include more detailed and in depth combat. So I lowered its rating a bit because though I will play it if it is suggested I will usually pull out other games before this. It does not really give the feeling of empire building or give you a real sense of exploration. It is entertaining though and we still play it now and then.

UPDATE.
Revisiting this game again... really is a great game. Many paths to victory and always tough tense choices to make. A classic worker placement game with area control, set collection i.e. commodities, and building Capital Buildings that provide special advantages and VP's - and give a sense of empire though abstract.

while this doesn't have much of the RTS feel of the AOE III video game, it does present an interesting and fun look at a Eurosnob/Ameritrash hybrid.  i enjoyed the game play, and there was enough ways to stab your neighbors, though not always taken advantage of.  runaway victories seem common, and this causes some concern.  Nice pieces, everything looks good... though the board seems a little spare.  The rules are awesomely complete and clear.

Played it once.  Enjoyed it, for the most part, despite spending all game in a blood feud with someone.  It definitely has a "unique" feel to it, as far as worker placements go, with the ridiculous number of pieces that end up in play.

That said, I hate how similar all of the plastic miniatures look.  I'm not sure what idiot came up with the designs but not differentiating them more absolutely blows my mind.

I frequently win this game, and it's usually because I'm settling and discovering, but it's not my fault!  Everyone keeps beating me to the other strategies!

Wow, what an awesome awesome game.  The way how the different elements interact and come together, the importance of when your turn is and the precedence of your selections, all intertwine to make it a very deep as well as strategic experience.  However, I do have one concern which deals with the replayability.  While there are many ways to victory, I do wonder if they are all created equal.  I am not totally convinced if there's any good way to beat the monastery, cathedral, migration and colonization tactic.  Maybe I was just lucky to have been able to purchase all those buildings which combined to win me the game by a big margin, but I am curious to find out if I can even achieve and surpass the points I was able to accumulate by using that method.

Update: Well, I finally got a chance to play AoE III again albeit in a tournament setting, and I have to say that a 5-player game is vastly different than one with 4.  Stupidly I tried to employ the same strategy that won my first game by forgetting that now there's one extra person competing for limited resources and spots on the board; not to mention I couldn't dominate the colonization scene with the Monastery-Cathedral-Population combo due to the fact that the first two buildings didn't even come up.  So there are definitely a bit more that meets the eyes, and the necessity to refine my strategy for future plays.

Update #2: It's been several months since I last played and rated AoE III, I have to honestly say that I haven't had the urge to want to get this on the table.  In all actuality I've avoided playing this on couple of occasions, therefore, I'm going to knock a fraction of point off, and if the feelings persist, it might go down even more.

Age of Empires III is certainly derivative of other games (Caylus, Puerto Rico) but the conglomeration of familiar mechanics and new (the Discovery element, for instance) makes this a very fun game to play with multiple paths to victory.  I've been thinking about the game ever since I played it the other day, so I expect the rating to (potentially) go up with subsequent plays.

Buen juego de gestión de recursos. La parte positiva es que todo funciona bastante bien, pero por otro lado, es un poco largo y las figuras no me gustan demasiado (y encarecen el juego).

El Grande-area control meets Pillars-worker allocation.  Bogs down when players are trying to place colonists in the territories, but I love pretty much every other aspect of this game.

Rock solid game, here.  [person=1115]Glenn[/person] has come a long way since [thing=6707]Age of Mythology[/thing].  This game is laden with tough decisions and gambles.  While comparisons could be drawn to several respected games, [thing=22545]AoE3[/thing] gels into its own unique experience.  The miniatures are, of course, excess, but they're fun, and unlike [thing=6707]AoM[/thing], you needn't refer to cards for them the whole time.  This is a really good game, and it not only feels good, it also evokes the them quite nicely.  Minimizing your expeditions without risking failure...  Choosing which crucial action you need to nail first, so no one beats you to the punch, only to find that the other critical one is what people wanted...  Many ways to approach the game successfully.  This is a joy to play.  From 2 to 6 players, this game is fraught with tough decisions and delicate competition for resources.

Incidentally, using cubes on the score track works way better than using colonists!

Probably my favorite worker placement game of the ones I've played to date. It doesn't feel as cohesive overall as Agricola, but the tension of the play is there. Like Puerto Rico, the politcal incorrectness of the theme is always fun to point out to newbies.

3355에서 지리한 경험을 해서 학을 떼었던 게임이다. 그 때에도 구성물은 괜찮아 보였으나, 어리버리한 진행과 늘어지는 시간으로 인해서 꽤 짜증이 났었다. 그 이후로 계속 거리를 두다가 이번에 GT님이 장터에 올려서 트라움 파브릭과 함께 구했다. 다 따로 정리함에 모아두고, 참조표까지 있어서 나름 쾌적한 구성이다. 게다가 내가 규칙을 쭉 읽어보니 전략도 풍부하고 괜찮을 것 같다. 역시 게임은 그 자체의 특징보다도 누구랑 하느냐에 따라 많이 좌우되는 것 같다. 나중에 확장도 따로 구할 생각이지만, 솔직히 본판과 가격 차이가 안난다는 점은 좀 짜증난다.

Nice mechanism, remembers al little Puertorico. I don't like the layout of the map, I would spend more space fore the world map and less for the actions. Manual not exaustive 100% Difficult to recover from a disadvantaged position, 8 turns are to few to develop an interesting strategy. More tactic than strategic. In general it is interesting but not in my top ten rank.

Евро на выставление рабочих. Есть элементы войны. Самая комплексная и интересная игра с этой механикой (типа Каменного Века), но идёт слишком долго - поэтому 7 баллов, а не 8.

Was not thrilled about the game mechanics. If you are able to get a good building in the first round, you are almost always going to win.

Area control and worker placement game. Very good production with lots of miniatures, ships and plastic coins.

This is a solid game. There are quite some different strategy routes to follow, it's easy to explain and plays quickly. Combat is very basic and simple. It's certainly not a big conflict game, but just area control.   

Minor things that could be better are the small spaces to place your miniatures on in the Americas, they should have used the empty boardspace better. 

Thematically it lacks naval conflict. And all nations are the same : miniatures and what they do. This however doesn't detract from the gameplay. 

Another little thing is that it's unknown which buildings will appear for each game, so it's more difficult to set up a long term strategy. It however makes it also that you have to be more flexible.

Discoveries can be hit or miss even if you maximize your input of men. So this is actually my main concern. It's push your luck at great cost if you fail. 

Lastly it would have been cool if you could have moved your men around between colonies.   

It's not a topper nor has it something that blows you away, but it is very tightly designed and decent. 

A similar game is Dominant species, which is also longer to play and has more going on at the board. It has more options like wandering between spaces, unique factions, ice age mechanism... but AoE is shorter, quicker and tighter.

A worker placement game that is quite rules-heavy. The theme works well and is nicely integrated. The components are well done (except for the score track around the board, which is way too small). The game isn't really very long, and even has some conflict, though said conflict involves no luck, and I like at least a dash of luck in my conflict. I suppose the main thing about this game that I don't like is that it doesn't stand out from the pack. This wouldn't be a problem if, every year, more and more excellent games were not released, but there are. This game is executed correctly, and if you're interested in the colonization theme, give it a go, but still - it doesn't exactly make itself known in a crowd of worker placement euros.

AoE3 is an excellent game.  The best thing about it is there are many paths to victory and all are equally viable.  There is enough player interaction to make it intersting even if players aren't directly competing for the same victory conditions. Very engaging.  High fun factor!

A much more adversarial worker placement game than most. A pretty bland board hides really a very good game, with a ton of options and strategy.
And a boat load of awesome plastic.

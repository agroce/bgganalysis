RATING: 7
An intriguing, unusual worker-placement game, with a clever use of pace and timing. Players must build up majorities in various action-spaces in the early stages of the game, in order to score points later, by deconstructing the majorities they previously created. The skill in the game is working out when to start deconstructing. It's a unique experience, with clever mechanics, and plenty of different strategic paths to take.

Not as much fun as the reviews made it sound.  A decent game, it's just about finding the right tipping point for your plans.  It was interesting to see just how close we came in score, though all of our strategies were vastly different.

RATING: 5
Be patient: the game gets much better in the second half! Some very intriguing and innovative concepts in Sutter's Mill that don't work in an overly engaging manner, due (to some extent) to the rather light theme. I think that Herr Teubner has some very good ideas in this game, and that Sutter's Mill is the dry run for a much better game that he will produce in the future. Just the very concept of a game where you build up an empire in order to tear it down is something I haven't encountered before.
My rating may go up, but it certainly will never be one of my favourite games.

RATING: 6
An OK worker placement game in which you balance competing for control of buildings (which give special powers) with mining a gold seam for nuggets that score victory points.  The main interest lies in timing your departure from town ahead of the gold running out.

I've played with three and four players.  With four, I felt that the gold ran out a little too quickly to allow struggles for control of buildings to really develop, but that might just be down to the way we played.

RATING: 7
One play so far. But I liked this quite a bit ( winning helped:) ). Very simple rules but a ton of things going on. The timing of the tear down is a fun thing to work out and quite a clever mechanic as you're almost playing the same game again but in reverse. Good theme too

There are two phases to the game, build up and retreat/'tear down'.  The switch is chosen by the players individually.  Luck on how many nuggets you discover.  Wasn't particularly engaged by the game, but prepared to play again to confirm opinion.

Finally got a chance to try this one. I'm kind of amazed at the 6+ ranking that this one gets on BoardGameGeek. The instructions were very difficult to follow. I think they could have been summed up so much more plainly. I think we were playing it correctly, though I am not 100% sure. It seemed to go really fast. I think we were done in about a half an hour. And the ending floundered. The last person on the board just kept taking free turns until he got all the rest of the gold. I couldn't see any rule that explained how to handle that better, and I guess I wasn't interested in making the game longer. The rules say you just keep playing till there's no more gold on the board. But we had all removed our Prospectors from the board, so there was still gold on the board at the end of the game. The last person, of course won. This might be fun for little kids if the rules were made more readable for little kids. And the ending needs to be fixed. I honestly think it took longer to learn this game than it took to play it.

I'm not sure why Sutter's Mill does not get a  little bit better ratings. I suppose its probably a little simple for experienced board-gamers. I am just getting into games again, so I really enjoy the mechanics of this game. And the components are nicely made. The rules take quite a bit of memory recall, but just give it a few plays to stick in your mind. I think that the game would probably get a little same-y if it were played too often, but its nice light play for a change-up now and again.

There are interesting ideas in this game - players need to jointly make progress on a single mining track before jumping to higher value sections, you lose points if you don't clean up the board (tear down camp) and special powers. Unfortunately all of these interesting ideas feel thrown together and don't act as a cohesive unit. It wasn't bad for the 1 hour play time but there also wasn't anything that I feel is drawing me back into the game to play it again.

Sutter's Mill has two very distinct phases. In the build-up phase you invade a small gold digger town in force, exploiting the claims and businesses. When the gold threatens to run out everyone switches to tear-down instead. Now you try to still grab as much as possible while also pulling your diggers out because those left in town when the game ends will cost you points.

The decision of when to switch from construction to flight is the pivotal point of the game and provides quite an interesting dilemma. Unfortunately, the tension and drama doesn't run quite as high as I had hoped. I believe this is because not pulling your assets out by the end of the game (which is entirely in the hands of the players) is too cheap. You can lose a maximum of 15 points, and keeping your diggers at work for a turn or two longer can yield dividends of a similar magnitude.

I've got mixed feelings about this.  It's fun but it always feels like the game ends too soon.  The biggest problem with that as the end of the game last almost as long as the build up.  You spend half the game thinking "it's already over?"

This is a provisional rating, as more plays are needed in order to truly determine if initial impressions are accurate.  Sutter's Mill is an interesting blend of worker placement, and area influence mechanics blended with a unique timing mechanism that brings an element of risk into the mix.  The rules are easy to learn and understand, but gaining a strong hold on the timing will come with more plays.  I want to think this is a great game, but there is definitely need for more ironing of the rules.

This game gets mixed reactions. Mechanically quite simple but different enough to engage interest. Board and pieces are nice. The key strategic decision is when to go into teardown, everything else is tactical. I would enjoy playing more but it seems to leave everyone else feeling a bit miffed.

RATING: 2
Perhaps we did not play this right, as my experience was not enjoyable at all.  The mechanics are simple, but there appears to be a combo available to the first player, and the last player seems rather disadvantaged.

In any event, I was able to place a few (4) cards, but was not able to pull them out without giving more points to my opponents.  Our 4-player game ended with a score of 87, -2, -6 and -20.  With only one player scoring positively....

The mechanic of having to move your pawns to town in order to collect gold tokens, then having to pay to move them back to the mine(s) is quite clean and works well.

On the other hand, the mechanic of adding cards to take control of town buildings and then trying to remove them or suffering negative points, does not work at all.

Rating should have been a 1, but I just love the Phalanx game components.  Still, you won't catch me dead playing this again.

I like how the game really evokes a boomtown theme of "get out while the getting's good." The game is not very complicated, but the player aid is not good and it feels a little clunky in places -- I feel like it's crying out for just a bit of streamlining, but I'm not sure exactly how. Still, a fun game.

RATING: 7
Initial rating one play Essen 08 

Here you have a game that almost defines elegance, so much so it felt like something Dorra himself would of done. Very easy to learn, rules kept simple yet interesting decisions to make throughout the game, this was one of the big pluses for me on this one along with the balance. Also, despite picking gold up randomly there is very little luck in the system, there was enough mining by all that the little variances evened out for the most part I'm sure. 

The game itself is sort of an area control game but really really different from the huge amount of AC games out there. The theme actually works in this game as you will see the more I describe it. Players are miners that need to visit the nearby town to gain abilities to help them mine the gold in the hills. There is a big twist though, once gold starts getting close to being depleted you need to start clearing your workers out of the town, once the gold is gone you will lose points for having workers and influence (cards) on the board still at the end of the game. The really cool thing about this is each player decides when he will enter his own 'second' phase of the game, once you switch there is no going back (some push your luck). Timing this is critical since you can not collect anymore gold (points) once you have switched and if you wait too long you will be penalized. 

Players have 5 workers to help them in their task of gathering gold and distributing influence around the city. The City has several buildings and each one has its own little special power that helps you in the game in some way. In order to receive a power you must have the most current influence, this is done by having a worker present and by playing a card into the city. Each player starts the game with the exact same cards, 2 to Ace and every time a new card is played into a City it is assessed to see whether a power has to change hands or not. 

Gold are VP's and are mostly gathered by leaving workers down by the river to pan for gold. You actually collect gold by moving your workers from the river into the city, intersting balance here as you need to have gold to buy actions in the game, you need the workers in the city in order to carry out most of the actions. Your first action was always free but this is a game of efficiency like many others so doing one action per turn won't net you many special powers which net you more important things like more gold, an extra action, switching cards around, etc. The more actions you wanted to take, the more expensive it became to do them. It seemed optimal to try and do about 3 actions according to the pay scale which meant balancing your workers between the river and the town. 

This is mostly a tactical affair, long range planning is pretty much out due to the powers constantly shifting and the unknown time factor. Playing with 4 I suspect to be a touch chaotic for the reason I just mentioned, the 'musical chair' effect of the powers which are hugely important to your success in the game but 4 would also be the most competitive number to have at the table and the key towns would surely be hotly contested. My preference would most likely be with 3 (this is common for me) for the added control. 

I can see that the optimal moves and certain dominant strategies might become too apparent too quickly here. This is not as bad as it sounds though as your opponents learn with you this just means that the more valuable things on the board will always be competitively fought over in a pissing match kind of way (actually the musical chair comparison is better) but I think will hurt the replay slightly. 

Summary - I enjoyed this game and would definitely play again, most likely a try before buy for most people, should only run an hour which is just about right for this weight. 

Edit - Many years later I have not played again but still want to, even though many others seemed to of had a bad experience. I am thinking the game could be subject to 'group play', where players can possibly ruin the experience, need to play again to see

First play proved interesting in some ways for me, but lacked drama and excitement that I was hoping to see occur in the take down phase.  Perhaps messing up one rule would have made a significant difference, we'll see.  I still want to give this one another play before giving up on it.  I was expecting far more tension about when to start leaving town than actually occurred...Second play was slightly more interesting, but I'm not certain there are many ways to victory.  It may just end up being who chooses their timing to tear down the best which seems like a lot of game to play for one pivotal point.

Second time around proved there was still no interest.  Sold in the Lydia charity auction.

I really wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised.

Though it will take a play or two to grasp the strategy and overall flow of the game, the payoff seems worthwhile for the 60 minutes you'll play.

It's an area majorities game at it's heart, with a smattering of intuitive worker placement. It also has a distant resemblance to Thebes as the "digging for gold" is a random string that pays out an average of two, but can be as high as 4. Certainly with a good plan, though, one can net great profit with minimal attempts. You can however get equally thwarted if someone else is planning a step ahead; another good sign that it's the game that rewards good planning rather than just plain luck.

I'm not sure you can catch up if you're behind, though often times players are much closer in score than might first appear. The game's also only an hour, so that plays to it's favor. 

I still wonder if it's the newness of the game or not, so it earns a tentative 7 until I play once more.

It's an area majority game dressed up in goldrush clothes. Turns spent digging up the gold are really just the means to buy actions in later town-turns to earn much bigger points by playing out your VP-earning influence cards in areas (and earning areas' special powers as well). Which brings with it the usual area majority gripes. If you get into a see-saw battle for the best power(s) then you end up knocking each other out while the others run away with it, and if you don't, the player with the best powers runs away with it. Which is an unsatisfying and unsocial decision tree, with the king-making implications implicit. It has the bones of an interesting decision on when to reverse your game-play so as to extract out all your played cards to convert them from negative VPs (if on board at game end) into positive VPs, but it punishes anyone who goes too early because they don't have the means (special powers) to clear the remaining gold from the board quickly enough to end the game. Meaning the players with the powers can afford to reverse later, gain the powers they need to clear their board and catch up on the reverse-out race. Making it less of a game defining decision than it leads one to expect, and the game is lesser for the lack of fulfilled expectation. In a word, disappointing.

RATING: 6
It was... OK. I liked the overall narrative of the game. In the first half prospectors arrive in a gold rush town and start extracting gold as fast as they can. But as the gold begins to run out, each player must decide when to flip from 'build up' to 'tear down' mode, dismantling their engine and taking prospectors off the board before the gold runs out and they score negative points. 

Mechanically, it reminded me a bit of Municipium - both have buildings that offer special powers to the majority occupant, and which change hands often. Control of buildings is two-level: you get a prospector into a building and then you use him to play one of your control cards (in a nice touch, these are based on a standard deck). The rules are pretty simple, the fight for the buildings quite interactive and it's reasonably quick. So, I didn't hate it. But I was still left with the nagging sense that I was wasting my time learning a mediocre game when I could be playing a great one. Such is our hobby...

Pros:
* It plays really fast
* The game cleans up after itself

One play with three players. The biggest "problem" with this game is group-think. Basically, if none of the players choose to play aggressively, then you have a very lackluster and anti-climactic game.

In this game, you choose how many actions to perform during your turn. However, the more actions you perform, the more you spend: 1 action, 0 gold; 2 actions, 1 gold; 3 actions, 3 gold; 4 actions, 8 gold; 5 actions, 15 gold. In our game, no one bothered to push the game faster to its conclusion and spend the 15 gold.

Why would you want to make the game end quickly? During the game, you play influence cards of various values of your colour. Partway through the game, you have to start taking those cards off the board. If those cards are on the board before the game ends, then those cards count as minus points against you. In our game, no one bothered to do this.

With this in mind, the game might feel more strategic. However, there's another issue. This is a worker placement game in which you have to compete (with a simple area majority mechanic) who gets to control which worker. Every player has a suit from an ordinary deck of cards to act as influence. Face cards are worth 10 influence points, numbers their face value, and Aces 11.

Each worker generally allows you to perform a specific action for free. In addition, each worker allows you to pick up one more scoring chip (e.g. gold). Two issues: (1) The free action that the worker grants you is useful only during a certain phase of the game and (2) the secondary action of a worker (picking up an additional chip) is sometimes more useful.

Simply put, the competition for these workers isn't very competitive.

Several issues:
* Because you have a limited number of influence cards, players soon figure out it is not worth anyone's effort to get into a influence card fight. Players soon give up and focus on easier-to-get cards.
* Because the secondary action of a card is quite good to begin with, and because you can't use the primary action of a card throughout the game, players tend not to care too much worker they manage to get; any worker is simply better than none.

Further plays with better understanding of the rules and with more players might improve the rating. [2009-MAY-17]

This game is under rated. As a few others have mentioned, the game description does sound a little more interesting than actual game play, but still, it is a fairly fun game with unique mechanic of building up and then tearing down. 

You play your point cards (2 through 11)on the buildings to gain that building's benefit (but you have to have more points than your opponents on the building.) You have to remove those cards when tearing down to gain the points - and sometimes your cards get buried on top of your opponent's cards. If you don't get your cards removed by game end the points count against you.

Someone mentioned in their comments that the rules were a mess. I totally disagree, I thought the rule book was very clear with plenty of examples. 

I would have given a little higher rating if the game had Days of Wonder graphics. The graphics of the town are quite dull with just the roofs of the buildings. 

Over all quite a fun and unique game, I don't regret the purchase.

might be a bit of haha moments due to removing cards at opportune moments.

A push-your-luck game where you only make the decision to stop pushing ahead once per game.  Players work to move into, and influence, the city.  Each player then decides when they think the city is about to go bust and starts pulling their people and influence out of town.  During each each of these two main phases there are interesting decisions to make as to how you'll proceed.  My family's opinion was split on this one.  My son and I thought it was pretty good, but the ladies didn't care for it.

This look interesting but our first game didn't fare best. I'll try it again to see if it's gets better.

Cool take on area control games.  You take over regions for actions and then you have to take particular effort to get all your resources out of town before you lose points with them.  You can force others to do your dirty work for you. Very different from much else out there.

Game is nicely produced and wonderfully thematic, and you do get a nice feel of the boom and bust of a gold-mining town in the Wild West.  The mechanics even work well and have some novelty.  Yet it's hard to get excited about this game and I agree with the reviewers that it's missing the compelling element to draw you in.  My best attempt to describe what's missing is as follows: it's tough to see how well you're doing, especially relative to others, your options are ultimately pretty limited, and it's hard to see the net effects of your actions.

This is one of the most inovative games I've played this year (2008). I only think that it should be a bit more fast paced. I like the mechanics that make players remove things from the board. It's a good solid design with simple rules and a good amount of difficult choices.

There are so many ways to play this game. You could stick with gold digging or invest in the town if you are confident of being able to  cash your investments in. Or a mixture of both.

Lot's of tough decisions: Do you invest with your highest cards or lower one's; spread your investments wide among all 8 building or specialise in a few; Go for the most attractive buildings for that stage of the game or those that players are of least intesrest and use.

Do you save your investments until later in the game or earlier. 

And the big question: when do you switch from a Build phase to a Tear Down phase, if at all.

As you gain in experience you'll realise that the church can be used to great effect in altering the order on which cards can be taken off the stack and having the only prospector to finish off the digging in the river or hills gives you the ability to delay the game while you set up for the next or final phase.

But will you be able to get your men and investments out of town before the gold dries up? 

Well it all depends on how your fellow Townfolk play. A few late investments from them and they could bury your investments and change your plans in an instant. Worse still they could be racing to dig all the gold out of the mines and end the game and leave you with those massives debts to pay.

The ways to hussle your enemies and get hussled are numerous in a game that depicts the meteoric rise and fall of gold town in a mere 13 years.

Analysis Paralysis will do you no good in this place pardner. Guts, gut feeling and a quick just might.

One of the more intriguing recent games. You play cards onto buildings to exert influence, but also to seed the board for VP. Later in the game you start to tear things down by removing cards. Cards removed score VP for their owners, cards left on the board count negative, cards unplayed don't score. There's also a trail of nuggets that [i]look[/i] like gold, but I'm not sure exactly how valuable they are.

Very fun game.  Plays in two phases.  In the first, you are adding prospectors and influence to the community.  Then, all hell breaks loose as everyone rushes to get out of town before the vein dries up.  Has a nice combination of worker placement, area control, and timing to create a fast, tense experience.  Plus the theme is well done.  A hidden gem!

In Sutter's Mill the players experience the sudden rise and decline of the Californian town of Coloma during the gold rush.
They first build up the town, bring new citizens into it, and, last but not least, dig gold. However, when it is time and the gold vein is almost spent, they better take their belongings and get the hell out of Coloma!
In the game, this is represented by a division in two phases: build up followed by tear down. At the beginning of the game, all players start in the build up phase. It is up to the players themselves to decide when there's no more profit to be had and to enter the tear down phase. Each player makes this choice for himself, so while some players are already tearing down the place, others will still be building up.

One play, 3 people, Spiel 08.  Good timing is very important, both to maximise income/VP during the game, and especially in the end game. I was first player and seemed to have an early advantage, but that proved only temporary.

Certainly a S7 game.  Interesting card mechanism making this a good card hand management game.  Play matches the theme of get in/get out of the boom and bust gold town era.

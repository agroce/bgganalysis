Brilliant mechanic and I really like the science bent (which is now unfashionable). The game does suffer from the fact that certain atom structures neccesarily take longer to the deduce than others, limiting its value as a competitive game. Given that limitation, though, it is fun in a non-competitive environment. Entropy (or Hyle) is the other game that Eric Solomon is (rightly) proud of and it is even better.

Kind of like Mastermind.  I like this one better overall.  I would play this one if given the opportunity, but I don't have a copy, or know anyone with a copy.  I'm really amused that this one has been tagged solo.  I don't think they have played the game if they tagged it solo.

This game was the jump point for my future weakness for board games. Simple, elegant mechanics that can be ejoyed by players of all ages. Nice deduction element to finding the solution. One of the few games I can take in the car with my children for entertainment. Proved an excellent distraction for three high-strung young badminton players on their way to a junior county match!

RATING: 7
Competitive puzzling can feel a bit forced as a game genre, unless it is done so well that most players won't even realize that they are essentially flying solo. The best in the genre, like "Battle Ships" and "Mastermind", have become classics and few people would consider them to be anything BUT a game.

This is a spot-on game, and one of the best of its ilk. It was even my favourite puzzle-solver right up until the release of "Ricochet Robot", partly because that one breaks with the tradition of switching roles between problem-setter and problem-solver between turns, as it had come up with an ingenious mechanism that allows everyone to have a crack at solving the puzzle simultaneously. Mostly because it is also about rays and deflections, but far more frantic and fun-filled.

Thankfully, here, the fun-part is not just reserved for the one who is trying to place the atoms correctly. I have found it surprisingly rewarding to hear other people's logic at work when they tackle my set-up, even more so when it happily comes off the rails and leads to the wrong conclusions. And then quietly wait for that "what?" moment when "it doesn't make any sense". But nothing beats having a stab at it yourself, and it is one of those hideously addictive ones that demands instant replays.

First time players do not always instinctively grasp the exact path of deflected beams, but after a game or two it does become second nature and few people will refuse a rematch.

There are a handful of set-ups that would leave the location of the fifth ball completely undeductable. Usually you can find well-hidden atoms by eliminating all other possibilities, but since it is possible to create a small zone that cannot be penetrated by exploratory rays, it would hardly be fair on the guesser to face a solution lottery. Our only house-rule is that those set-ups are outlawed.

ONLINE SOLITAIRE: there is a variation on this game on the designers' own webpage (see links- now also released as a proper boxed game by Franjos), played on a hexagonal board using 10 atoms, and if you vaguely like this game you should try it out, it's grand! If I was rating that version it would be closer to a 9, and I will certainly make a board myself. THAT is the perfected version of the game that this has the potential to be.

A cracking game!

UPDATE: the hexagonal version has now been released as [gameid=31853], a 'proper' game, and that, in all likelihood, will result in the permanent shelving of this version. I can see it resurface for our younger guests who find the hexagonal reflection angles too confusing.

[7/8/2006]Intriguing deduction game. I'm sure I'll be playing this in future when having to endure boring lectures, travelling etc. :)

BTW, I'd go for both players simultaneously solving a puzzle each. Whoever needs fewer "moves" wins... If it's unsolvable, then a player wins even if finishing second (serves the person right, who set up the unsolvable situation). Something on those lines...

The chemist in me finds it pleasing to play a game in which an atomic structure is to be deduced by firing 'rays' into the box containing the molecule, and looking at the emerging scattering pattern. That is indeed more or less how it happens in Real Life too. However, in the latter case Nature does the hard work of scattering for us: in this game another player needs to understand the rules [i]very well[/i] to take on that particular role. 

Once that little detail is sorted out it quickly transpires that Black Box is not really a game in the usual sense of the word. Players have to make guesses which can turn out to be fantastic in terms of deduction (for example passing straight through), or utter crap (the rest). It's not fair that such guesses are not weighted in some way or form: the way to actually play a [i]game[/i] of Black Box would be to have a computer determine what a good average score would be based on the molecule structure, and then compare the player's actual score against that computed value. One would expect a good player to do consistently better; and precisely that would have to be awarded by winning the game. As it stands now, Black Box is more of a puzzle. A charming puzzle, but a puzzle nonetheless. 

Consequently, the 'game' will attract no rate from me. But I will say that it is one of the more pleasing puzzles I've come across, so rated on a puzzle scale it would appear at an above average level.

More of a puzzle than a game.  One player makes the puzzle, and the other player solves it.  Then they switch.  But as puzzle-games go, I find it&#039;s more enjoyable than Mastermind.

Here we have a game that is similar to Battle Ship. The goal is to find the hiding marks by "shooting" "rays" and getting directions from the non-active player. The game is good for people who are spatially minded and can visualize the invisible rays. You will also need to have a good memory and strategy skills. 

I would consider this a medium weight game. There is a lot of learning involved and the rules become clearer as you practice the game. Thankfully it comes with test games. 

The set up is easy once you have it down, but if you don't remember the code names for directions you can easily mess up your game. The players must be accurate or the game won't end well. 

Solo players will have an easier time playing if they can't find a mate who can play correctly.

Overall the more practiced the players are the better the game. I don't personally enjoy being the active player, but don't mind being the non-active player hiding the marks and giving out codes. I'll play it if someone twists my arm. 4/10

Neat little deduction game that I think is much better than Mastermind. Quite a brain burner at times! Funky 1970s design that I always love in abstracts from this time. Yeah, I'll keep this around. It's a puzzle game more than a hard abstract, but it's nice. Though I recognize that two equal players might have luck play more of a part as it really just comes down to whether you were fortunate enough to hit the balls earlier than your opponent.

More a logic puzzle than a board game, that is best played solitaire with a look up table than two player. Still cool how they used a computer back in 1978 (four years before the C64 was released) to calculate average number of hints required to solve a configuration of marbles.

RATING: 6
An odd, but amusing "puzzle game."  One player prepares the puzzle by placing marbles on a grid and the guesser then gives entry point coordinates and the preparer explains where the "laser beam" would reflect out on the grid.  The trick is to figure out the location of the marbles in the shortest amount of guesses.  Then the players switch roles to see who gets the best score.  There is also some sort of solo variant, apparently.  There are various charts to play that if you wish.

1977?  I would have sworn this game was older than that!  I've always thought of Black Box as one of my gateway games, but if it was published in 1977/1978, then I had already been playing games for over ten years when this game hit the store shelves.  I have fond memories of this game and it has "stuck" in my memory over the years. More of a two-player puzzle than an actual game, I still like figuring out where the balls are located based on the input and output data.  The game mechanic resonates with me.  I lost my original copy in a move sometime and aquired a replacement copy on eBay.  A lot of fun if you like games of logic.

RATING: 7
Classic deduction game in which players guess where "atoms" are hiding according to how rays shot from different spaces on the border of the board are deflected. The plain game needs to be played in two rounds since one player must guess the other player's pattern (or better said: it can be played competitively on two boards racing for the win). It takes a mere handful of games to grow some skill in ruling out spaces on the board when guessing, but quite an amount of games more to find out the right patterns to mislead the opponent.

Black Box is pretty much playable with a chess set but it certainly benefits from a more clinical, science-tinged presentation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Mastermind for adults and crystallographers. Good in short bouts and doubly pleasing for the fact that it can be played on one's knees while doing something else. Solid, chunky components at least make you feel like you've got your money's worth.

I suspect my copy is an original - has been at the family holiday house since roughly 1978.

I loved this game when we first got it, however with more plays there are a few flaws - it's too easy with 5 balls to build an un-gettable situation, making your opponent guess rather than deduce, and with 4 balls it's too easy to find them.  It doesn't stop the game being fun though.

RATING: 4
One player secretly chooses five points on an 8x8 grid. Their opponent deduces where they are by naming spaces on the edge from which an imaginary laser will be fired, the placing player announces the result. E0.g. if the beam would go straight across the grid then it was a miss; under other circumstances it can hit, deflect 90 degrees, or reflect back.

Clever concept that just isn't either fun or interesting. Like many deduction games it suffers from wildly variable difficulty depending on the opponent's strategy, so I suppose the charm is in playing enough times in a row that it's a game of second-guessing and placing specifically to confound a known opponent. But it isn't nearly interesting enough for me to get that far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
{Abstract, couple; deduction} Black Box is a solid deduction game in the genre of Master Mind, in which one player is the master and the other player tries to guess where the 5 atoms are.  It's a little more challenging and visual attractive than Master mind; however, once a player developed the analytical method to solve a puzzle, each one is more or less similar.  The technique of this game is to build a puzzle dedicated for your opponent, which is lacking in Mastermind (in which the variety of patterns is very limited).

Nonetheless, it's a very good and fun game for children to practice (spatial) logical thinking. I know some players only like to be the puzzle maker, not the solver.

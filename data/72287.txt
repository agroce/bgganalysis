This one is more abstract and less themey than Mr. Jack. I also don't really like the mechanics as well. It just feels more odd than fun. In the end, there's no reason to get this one - unless you absolutely need Mr. Jack-like play literally in your pocket. Else, I'd avoid it.

RATING: 6
A brain-burning deduction filler.  You take Sherlock Holmes, Watson, and a dog and try to find Jack the Ripper. I'm not sure how the dog is able to communicate that he "sees" Jack, but he does: smart dog.  Fillers rarely get really high ratings from me because wargames almost always get the 10s, but this is fun way to spend 20 minutes.

This game is deceptively complex.  First few times I played it, I thought there is no way it will keep my attention, but after playing with different people a few times, I realized that the fun is in getting to know how your specific opponent thinks.  You would think that people would play this game the same way, maximizing the best next move, but I've found every person sees a different way to get what they want.  The asymmetrical aspects make the game worth playing a few times in a sitting.

I really like this game, nevertheless, in my opinion this is not Mr Jack, it's another game, a very good one, but you cannot find the piece of deduction of the original Mr Jack (maybe it's because it's too short to put in practise your thoughts). Anyway, a great game that everyone should try, at least, once.

After a few plays, I can't say that I'm impressed by the game. I find the game enjoyable but a little too thinky for my taste. If you think long enough, you'll eventually come up with the optimal move for the situation and this issue causes player turns to drag on for a while.

The joy of this 2-player game is the tactile feel of tossing up Action tokens to determine which you can take, turning and flipping the city tiles, winning hourglass tokens, and the back and forth action sequences taken between Jack and the Investigator. Gives such a small game a good share of replay value, and I can see this becoming a staple for us on the road, or whenever we need a quick, deductive game. Definitely makes me want to check out the larger titles in the series.

Diferent design than Mr. Jack. Now the board is composed of 9 tiles with a character each, you get the characters from the original Mr. Jack game and 3 characters from the extension, but it really doesn't matter because they're functionally the same, they don't have special powers.

Sherlock, Watson and Toby (the dog) move outside around this board and try to find where Mr. Jack is hidden.
This game also has the same Mr. Jack problem, it's harder to play as Mr. Jack than it is to play with the inspector.
But still it's a very nice version of Mr. Jack, and it's portable.

RATING: 6
A legkönnyedebb, legrövidebb Jack játék, de azért itt sem árt gondolkodni. Gondolom nem a táblás változatokkal akar versenyezni, hanem inkább arra való, hogy ha valakinek csak 10 perce van, akkor is tudjon Mr. Jackezni:) Így hogy minden létező Jack-et kipróbáltam, azt mondom, hogy ezek így együtt alkotnak egy nagyon jó kis világot, és nem bántam meg, hogy mindet beszereztem! Kedvtől függően elővehető akár a könnyebb alap, ami a kieggel bonyolítható kicsit, akár a hangulatában szerintem legjobb (és legnehezebb) new yorki, akár ez a kis változat is.
---
Mivel a nyomozó homokórái levonódnak Jack-éből, szerintünk sokkal nehezebb Jack-kel nyerni! Várjuk a Goodies kieget, az Jack-nek kedvez.
---
Na a dolog annyiban módosul, hogy mégsem kell levonni a homokórákat, a magyar fordítás rossz, és sajnálom, hogy pont ebben a fontos kérdésben van hiba, mert ez a játékegyensúlyt nagyban befolyásolja. Tehát a lényeg, hogy Jacknél csak az a kérdés, hogy szerez homokórát vagy sem, de sosem kell beadnia!

Fun version of Mr. Jack, and quicker. Asymmetric, with one player Mr. Jack and the other the detectives.  Game can be quirky with the reshuffling of the chips every 2 turns, sometimes making it impossible (improbable?) to win, but for the 15 minutes (or less) it takes to play, this random element is appropriate. Available in app format as well.

Initial Impressions: This is a fun 2 player puzzle. There are few components but they're good quality, with nice graphics. The game can be played in under 10 minutes, which means multiple plays per game session.

10 Plays: I still enjoy this game and find that with experienced opponents the game can become fairly challenging. Sadly, I find it difficult to get the game to the table despite it's small footprint and simple rules. It's now on my "For Trade" list and I hope someone else will play it more often than I did.

[i]Posted: 5/1/11, Rated: 7[/i]

Initially, I was underwhelmed by the contents of this toy-sized box.  There isn't a lot of wasted space, but it was difficult to divine how these meager components would approximate the luxurious, tense game play of the [thing=21763]full-sized version[/thing].  Yet when the game got going, I quickly saw how alike the two versions were!  True, [i][thing=72287]Pocket[/thing][/i] doesn't provide the same anguish over controlling a board with multiple threat vectors (lights, manholes, and barricades).  Yet it still provides tense moments as you try to limit your opponent's options.

As Jack, I found it harder to grow accustomed the winning conditions in the smaller game.  In [i][thing=21763]Mr. Jack[/thing][/i], not being caught by the end of the eighth round equals a victory for The Ripper: playing a "delayed game" makes intuitive sense, especially if the Inspector player is doing a good job of preventing your escape.  In [i][thing=72287]Pocket[/thing][/i], there is no direct analogy to "escape;" the closest matching condition is Jack collecting six hourglasses.  Hourglasses are printed on some alibi cards, and also on the turn tiles; if there is no witness at the end of a turn, then Mr. Jack captures that turn tile and its hourglass.

Thus, it was hard for me to accept "many witnesses" as a viable tactic on a turn, because I didn't want to forfeit the opportunity to earn an hourglass.  Once the different paths to victory melded in my brain, the game really opened up.  [i][thing=72287]Mr. Jack Pocket[/thing][/i] delivers much of the same flavor as its progenitor, in a surprisingly compact box.

Además, su portabilidad y buena producción lo hace ideal para viajes.

Way better than the original game, Mr. Jack Pocket is a fine two-player game on its own: its appearance belies its depth, as it looks like a lighter filler whereas it requires a deeper strategy that includes anticipating your next turn and outguessing your opponent.
The pasted-on Victorian theme fits the game perfectly and couldn’t be any more developed for the small game it is. [i](October 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Over the years, I’ve been playing Mr. Jack Pocket over and over and it never failed to offer a fun challenge to the both of us playing: hence, during my Fall 2015 rating revise I rounded up my rating from 7,5 to 8.

1 play. Not much to say. I like the small package, simple rules. It's interesting how Phantom of the Opera is an evolution of this idea, but writ large to make it back into a bigger Mr. Jack style of game.

Although I believe that experience corrects the imbalances between Jack and the Detective, Mr Jack Pocket is definitely a fairer game right out of the box. There's less to keep track of, and less of a learning curve, making the game more fun, but less brain-burning. 
I could see some people liking this more than the big version. I think if you enjoy one, you'll enjoy the other. I don't regret owning both.

While I enjoy the mechanics of this game, I can't help but feel it's a bit broken and strongly in favor against Mr Jack's player. It's still good fun, but because of this, I would never buy it.

RATING: 6
This is actually quite a bit like regular Mr. Jack and not even particularly quicker. Still, I think it was quite pleasant and maybe even slightly better than the original as this is more streamlined, but maintains the core rules. It is a tiny and portable game for sure, but the age of 14+ is probably accurate as there is a LOT to think about (not that there is any deduction involved) even though the rules are extremely simple. But the fact that you can turn around the tiles, and the fact that you go player A then B then B then A in the first round and then switch for the second makes it one of the worst offenders of introducing AP! I normally don’t suffer from AP, but this game almost encourages it… Especially as the four actions are flipped from the first to the second round, so you also know exactly which actions are available the next round, so you really need to think ahead…

I like the very different and odd/fun way of “selecting” the actions for the rounds; you simply toss the disks up in the air, and then the face-up sides are activated this round, and the other sides get activated during the next! It’s not a long game, 25 minutes or so, but you feel like you’re thinking a lot! What I really liked about the game, though, was the tension – you always feel that you cannot do what you want, and that the other player is going to win the next round! So it’s extremely tense, and both of my plays have been very close (I love assymetric winning conditions, and both sides have won). Definitely a game I’m intrigued by, although it won’t get played 10+ times as there are better 2p games out there.

A 2-player deduction game that seems to favor the detective as both our games ended by turn 3 with the detective winning. I can't see how Jack could get through 8 turns without the detective making a mistake, Jack would almost always have to win with 6 sand timers to me. It plays quick and I do want to play it again to see if the detective really is favored that much.

Mr. Jack is a decent 2-player game. But I got bored with it rather quickly. 

This picks up the same theme and some similar mechanics employed in new ways. And it is short. Pocket boils down the unique aspect of the game into something much shorter. Less is more.

It is a tense game of logic and deduction. It has just enough luck in it that balances itself rather nicely. And it can be played in 15 minutes. I really liked this one.

Very clever game. There is an element of luck, of course, which cannot be erased due to the mechanics of the game (one player flips four "coins" that determine which actions take place each turn). Yet, players are forced to think at minimum through the possible moves that their opponent will play during this turn. If you can, think through a whole turn or two in advance for best effect. This game is a lot deeper than it appears and very deep for the short duration of play time.

The strength of this game is that it's portable and simple. It gives 2 people something to distract them for awhile, such as at a restaurant. At 8-10 minutes per game, it's natural to play twice in a row. It isn't anything special in terms of great gameplay. It just does the job and has nice artwork. No complaints. Any deeper gameplay would have made it run longer and progress slower, so, for what it's designed to be, it's probably optimal.

Para mi gusto, es tan bueno o más que su hermano mayor (el normal, no he probado el New York), durando la mitad o menos. Te estás un buen rato dándole al coco, y te hace falta una gran dosis de inteligencia espacial. Algo dado al análisis parálisis, pero tampoco muy grave, en 15-20 mins la partida está liquidada.

This game is massively clever and a ton of fun to play. Mr. Jack's six-hourglass victory condition can feel a bit contrived and the street tile art is a little off-putting but the puzzle of how to use your two action tokens to most impede your opponent is so much deeper than it appears at first. As a quick, compact play, I love it.

Really enjoy this game. Requires some thought and planning, and clever play. The one downside is that it requires experience: new players simply won't be as competitive until they get a few games under their belt. Beyond that it offers a lot of game in a very small package and comes highly recommended.

I much prefer this streamlined version. The characters are stationary and do not come with individualized actions. Instead, the players choose from eight generic actions (really, just four, given how similar some of those are). Possibly best of all is the game's portability. Early results suggest that Jack is at a disadvantage, as in the original.

I really dislike this game. I'm sure it's perfect for a lot of gamers but I find it massively irritating. I recognize that it's well designed. In fact I can't quite put my finger on why I find it so extremely unpleasant. It's at least partly the dose of luck in an otherwise brain-burny design. Also the fact that the playtime is so far off. You can play it in 15 minutes, but you'd be playing pretty much at random. Unless you're a genius, it's going to take you a while to figure out your opponent's best move and your best move to block that move. 

For a head to head mid-length slugfest I'd never reach for this before Aton, The Duke, Tash-Kalar, Tzaar, Dreamwell, etc.

Players play either Mr Jack, or the detectives trying to identify Mr Jack from a cast of suspects.  Simple distillation of the Mr Jack game, boiled down to a 3 x 3 grid of rotating tiles with suspects printed on them.  Holmes, Watson and their dog move around the perimeter, peering down the alley ways.  At the end of a turn, Jack is either spotted or not, eliminating suspects.  Feels exactly like the base game, but without the special character abilities, and it almost feels better for it.  Nice reimplementation of the original game into a more compact form.

Fun little filler with a "Scotland Yard" aspect to it. Easy enough to play/explain, but I worry that a player who has played before has a huge advantage over someone who has never played. A lot of the game boils down to which actions you select when you're the first player as the other player will get two actions in a row.
Fun little puzzle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The theme might suggest it, but this isn't really a deduction game although there is a small amount of deduction involved.  It is primarily an asymmetric visual/spatial puzzle game, and quite a fun one!  The game mechanics are easy to learn and teach, intuitive, and somewhat innovative in a cute/clever way (especially the way the action tokens are randomized, and the way the hourglass tokens work as both a game timer and victory points for Jack). It definitely earns points for the attractive artwork and great portability. Initial impressions are that the role of Jack is a little bit harder to play, but I'm looking forward to future plays to see if this holds true.

[b]Cartas:[/b] No



[b]OPINIÓN PERSONAL:[/b]
Es bastante ligero, pero me parece descompensado en favor del investigador: ganar con el asesino es difícil si tu rival sabe lo que se hace, por lo que puede resultar bastante frustrante. Algunas personas recomiendan ir alternando los papeles, de manera que en una partida hagas de investigador y en la siguiente de asesino, pero es que el Mr Jack Pocket tampoco me parece lo suficientemente rejugable como para que te apetezca echar muchas partidas seguidas...

Comentar también que, pese al tema, no es exactamente un juego de deducción: aunque sepas quién es el asesino, no ganarás hasta que le arrincones completamente... y puedes arrinconar al asesino sin saber quien es, así que en el fondo es irrelevante descubrir su identidad.


[b]PD:[/b] Aparte, el juego tiene la desgracia de elevar el análisis-parálisis hasta niveles insospechados. No me considero un jugador especialmente lento, pero es que aquí si quieres calcular todas las posibles jugadas del rival por adelantado, te puedes tirar tus buenos minutos pensando... y eso para un juego (supuestamente) rápido como este, es criminal.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) I'm a sucker for a pocket-sized game. I'm also a sucker for a game that can be played in 15 minutes without feeling pointless. So when presented with a pocket-sized game that can be played in 15 minutes and successfully incorporates the difficult choices and forward planning that make the full-sized [GAMEID=21763] so compelling, but without feeling like a scaled-down copy... I am over the moon.

This is a surprisingly thinky game for such a small box.  My biggest and only complaint is the 2 sided tokens used for determining the actions for the rounds.  I wish they were cards so it was a little more portable (Which I can make easily enough if I wanted).  As is, everyone at my house feels the need to flip or throw them all into the air ... as high as they can... to randomize them.

Es un juego decente y entretenido para dos, pero da la sensación de que sólo con el setup se puede predecir el resultado de la partida. Aunque al del setup se suma cierto azar cada ronda, al menos en esta versión el investigador tiene que encontrar sí o sí a Jack, y no tiene por qué aventurarse al azar como pasaba con la versión "grande".  La pega es que el pocket resulta más abstracto.

Gyors, egyszerű, kis helyet foglal. Ideális utazó/kétszemélyes gém. Az alap Jacket nem ismerem, de ebből kihozták, amit lehet. Előre kell gondolkodni egy-két tokennel, meg a másik fejével, szóval kellemesen agyégető! Tetszik! :-)
(Megjegyzés: Mr. Jack könnyebb helyzetben van, egyszerűbb nyerni vele.)

Really impressive conversion of Mr Jack into a small edition. It plays very easily and presents a nice challenge. The extra chance for Mr Jack to win by gaining 6 hourglasses makes it much more balances. The suspect might be identified, but Mr Jack can still win.

RATING: 7
Fun. Light hearted. Quick. Compact. Lots of strategy. AWESOME pieces which should wear well. Minimum amount of luck. Its not the same as Mr. Jack but feels like its almost the same.  Recommend this one for couples, people on the move (I may throw this in my camping pack), or as a great filler. 

The suspects are generic and while in Mr. Jack I actual gave some thought to who the characters were in Mr. Jack Pocket I don't have any connection with the characters. Also the rule book is printed in many languages and ends up taken up most of the room in the tiny box. I like to keeps the rules with the games I own but for this one the rules are taken out. 

Edit: a bit thinky

For the tiny package that is Mr Jack Pocket there is a lot of game in there. It is, however, a very abstract game, with the inspector trying to divide and conquer the crowd of suspects, and Mr Jack trying to keep the flock together because it makes hiding easier. The action selection mechanism provides quite a bit of look-ahead and rewards analysing the available options for up to a turn in advance. You can put some serious thought into what the best moves are, yet at the same time, that same action selection process can be severely constraining. A great small package, and despite its size suprisingly close to the original Mr Jack.

Very smart design. Different gameplay than the Mr. Jack game it is based on, yet still holds exactly the same feel. Good for someone who owns the base game or someone who just wants a portable, playable version of the base game. Set up and completion fall occurs in enough time to maintain interest in the game.

After an intense 2nd play, I am raising this to an 8. I fear it may be better than the original (I fear this because I own the original and not this one). The variables to control in this one are just enough to make it a thinker without being a brain burner.

UPDATE A nice android implementation of this essentially abstract minimalist ok game rate 7; april 2014) UPDATE: Surprising lot of game in a small box - - I would think this gets better with more plays.  Nice abstract, but definitely seems difficult to win as Mr Jack (nothing wrong with that as its short enough to play again with different sides) (Rating 7.546, Dec 16)

RATING: 3
The game plays fast and is very portable. But that is about it really. It is based on the same mechanic than Mr Jack that they call deduction but is more dichotomic elimination to me. Very little opportunity for bluffing (unlike games like Scotland Yard or Letters from Whitechapel) and you will most likely end up finding who the killer is after having only two candidates remaining on the board. It feels horribly repetitive, lacks exciting decision making, replayability and depth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Wow!
For the amount of components and complexity - the feel of the bigger brother is still present, even more than i n Le Fantome.
However,  the game is sooooo much more abstract than the original Mr Jack (and Fantome) and has quite a lot of luck in the random distribution of hourglasses in the deck.
On the very other hand - the game is tight, short and tense. I like it a lot.
It seems like really a gem and great pocket title.
Recommended.

Mr. Jack Pocket is unique and a good bluffing and speculation game.

Fun enough logic/deduction game, but more of a puzzle. It lacks choices, there is always one clear choice of what to do on your turn, though you might have to look for a minute before finding it. It's good for something quick and light once in a while, though playing as mr. jack might frustrate some(game is skewed in favor of the detective)

Mr. Jack Pocket is a nice little game, even if it doesn't match the brilliance of Mr. Jack and Mr. Jack in New York. Those games are brain-busting gamer's games. Mr. Jack Pocket is a quick, light, casual filler. It won't get nearly as much table time as the two "bigger" Mr. Jack games, but I'm happy to own it. It's cheap, it's small, it has a nice splash of tactics and light deduction, and it fits into different moments and situations than its mom and dad. 15 minute games should be measured by a different standard than 30-60 minute games.

Those who have played Kupferkessel Co. will probably be reminded of that game as well as Mr. Jack itself. Mr. Jack Pocket has the same Kupferkessel grid layout, with the pawns moving around the outside and looking down the rows and columns. The feel is similar to Mr. Jack, but without the strong spatial element, without the special character powers, and without a lot of the nuance and difficulty. You'll be doing some of the same type of reasoning: "If I take this action, then he can do this in response, which would make my move pointless, so maybe if I take this action instead. . . ." In Mr. Jack, things get complex enough that I'm rarely confident that I'm making the "best" possible move. In Mr. Jack Pocket, I usually have a pretty good grasp on what my best move would be. But figuring that out is fun, even if I do sometimes feel like I'm playing "Mr. Jack for Juniors."

This game is fun and quick but I think it has a balance issue.  It is way more easy to win playing as the Inspector than playing as Mr. Jack.

He also sign my copy of the game which I also appreciate!

RATING: 6
I had high hopes for this one, but it didn't quite live up to them. I enjoy the original Mr. Jack, as does my wife, so I thought a quicker, smaller version would be a hit as well. Unfortunately, in paring down the game, they also pared down a bit of the fun. There's nothing wrong with this one, and I did like it, but there are other quick two-player games I'd rather play. I think the main problem was that my expectations were too high.

UPDATE: I've since played several more times, and I do like it better. I still like the original better, but for a quick, light deduction game that you can easily take with you, this one does an excellent job.

So far, Jack has yet to escape, but that doesn't take away from the fun of being either the chaser or chasee (chased?).  However, we'll see if this game can compete with the slew of other 2 player games I already own...Perhaps its big advantage is its size, it is actually small enough to fit into a large pocket and therefore might just sneak along for trips and get played then.

Jack has escaped thrice now and it makes the game much more enjoyable when you know he's got a chance.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Going first is extremely difficult. There are a lot of options to consider, and you could potentially solve each turn if you are willing to wrap your head around every single option. This leads to stress, because you know you COULD be winning.

There's a lot of luck as well. In a game where you can think a lot, AND there's luck involved... that's a problem. For example, you can solve the first 4 turns. Then, the roll of actions lands such that the opposing player gets the perfect combo and beats you. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fast filler for what it is. Keeps the same vibe and chrome as Mr. Jack, but not with any of the original's mechanics. 

Quick deduction game. Don't expect the relatively more complex chess game that is Mr. Jack when playing this.

In our group it's perfect to get a two-player game in while waiting for the rest of the group to arrive, since start to finish it takes less than 10 minutes per game.

Great production value and very portable which are also pluses.

Mr. Jack Pocket is good, simple game that's easy enough to teach/play quickly, but as small format game that is appropriate for travel the game goes from just 'good' to 'great.'  Compact and light, its a perfect companion for the road and helps eat up restless hours spent in airports, hotels, trains, etc. It was a game that I originally bought in Amsterdam expressly for travel and its lived up to that purpose again and again (a category that I wish was called out more often by reviewers and games evaluated on this standard). The characters, artwork, color palette, and print quality all contribute to a great experience that captures Arthur Conan Doyle's London setting or the Jack The Ripper legend quite well, considering how few components make up the game. I've never played the full size Mr. Jack game and have only considered this Pocket version in and of itself... and have found it to be excellent.  The only negative I can think of is that it seems harder to win playing as Jack (perhaps a bit unevenly weighted) but it just makes it that much more gratifying when succeeding as the villain that got away.

Excessive if you own the original (or Mr Jack in New York).  There are much fewer choices, decisions and possibilities here.  And you can much easier calculate everything.  
It's just way simpler and less interesting then its predecessors.  Compact size cannot cover for mechanics' deficiencies.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (January 2012)

Ok game. The gameplay is very nice. I particularly like the “I chose one you choose two actions” system, it creates some interesting decisions. Components are very nice too.

It seems that Jack has a harder time winning the game, eliminating suspects seem to be very easy. I don’t like the luck inherent in the game, in particular the alibi cards. First they can really mess with Jack if he has very bad luck, also, as they come with the hourglasses, they represent the way in which Jack will probably win, but it is pure luck if you get 0, 1 or two hourglasses. Fortunately, the play time is very short, so I don’t mind the luck as much. 

I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my new feelings toward the game, when I played this in January, I was still (relatively) new to the hobby. It is a game I would like to play around once a month tops. 

In conclusion, an ok game, perfect to play with new gamers and family. I’m still thinking about buying this, perhaps I will.

After more plays of this and its parent game, I have found a new interest in both games. I prefer the previous edition, but Mr. Jack Pocket is a good brainburner game. I won’t sell my copy for now and I’m upgrading its rating.

A pocket sized version of Mr Jack. Its a simplified version, and to Bruno Cathala's credit, it feels like a different game but I think I still find the original more tense and fun.

This game is all about the spatial aspect. It feels a little too abstract, like a rotation puzzle.

RATING: 9
Great two player game.

What you have is a (mostly) quick playing distilled version of Mr. Jack. It's extremely portable and a lot of fun. The rules are very simple and can be taught quickly to new players. Playing well on the other hand will take practice especially for those not familiar with multi-step logic games with a bit of randomness thrown in every two rounds.

If you've played the big version, they do differ enough to own both. There aren't any specific character powers in this version and the board isn't static. While they evoke a similar feeling and have a similar turn structure, the two do not share the same deduction strategies and the randomness comes across differently.

Mr. Jack Pocket takes Mr. Jack, ditches the special abilities of all the characters, puts the characters on tiles which the players can manipulate and packs it into a very small box. The result is an extremely portable 2 player deduction game with a very small footprint, which is easier to explain than Mr. Jack and plays very quickly. Cool game!

This is one of the first modern table games I bought for myself, and the first one that really started my obsession with a game in a tiny box.

Mr. Jack Pocket is hard; not just because it's a challenging puzzle, but because the hope of winning as Jack falls apart REALLY quickly.

Still, there is just something magical about how a game this interesting and complex fits in that little box.

RATING: 7
A 2 player game that is under-rated and overlooked. It's an elegant design, with simple rules, plays fast, and is extremely portable. This is not a simplified version of Mr. Jack. It is a completely different game.

It should be mentioned alongside other quick 2p games such as Battle Line, Lost Cities, Balloon Cup, and Parade. Yet it stands apart from them . All of those games involve a set of numbered cards in different suits. Mr. Jack Pocket is all spatial logic. It's fiendish little game.

About the game: 

The game is a small two-player deduction game, set in London of the late 19th century. 
One Player takes on the role of Jack the Ripper while the other controls three investigators including Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson and the dog Toby. 
Aim of the game is for Jack the Ripper to hide between the innocent people of London and for the investigators to prevent that. 
Therefore the players use different actions from a certain pool of actions that is available to them every turn. Which actions can be taken is randomly determined. If Jack is able to stay hidden at the end of a round, he gains an hourglass, if he is in line of sight of one of the investigators, they gain a magnifying glass. 
Once the investigators managed to narrow the suspects down to one person, they win. On the other hand if Jack is able to collect six hourglasses, he wins. 


My opinion: 

The game is ok. I like the artwork, which is gorgeous, but the gameplay does not convince me. I can't immerese myself in the game. I'll probably still play it if someone asked me, but I would rather play something different instead.

Great for airports, cafes, situations that require waiting but limit playing time commitments.  Also requires very little space (although there are many pieces).

Very intriguing at first, but had a limited lifespan for me, as I was eventually able to "figure it out" and play perfectly.  I would recommend playing it when you get it, and then saving it for those times a little pocket game would come it handy.

Trading: In perfect condition.

There's a lot of game in this 4"x4"x1" box!

They maintain the seen/unseen mechanism for elimination of suspects. They maintain the 1-2-1 rotation of actions each turn.

The kicker is that while it's a bit more abstract the game has the same feel and comes in at a 15-20 minute play time!

Great new Mr. Jack. I'd have never thunk it.

This is a beautifully produced and wonderfully original little game that's an almost miraculous steal at the price. But I got frustrated with it quickly in spite of the clever design and tense tactical gameplay because it seems woefully out of balance. With two experienced gamers at the table my guess is that the investigator would win about 80% of the time. Apparently the expansion evens things out a bit - will probably snag a copy of that soonish.

The best version of Mr Jack.  You please tiles with streets on a board.  You then have for actions tokens and Mr Jack and the Investigator take turns taking actions.  At the end of the turn, you determine if Mr Jack can be seen and flip over tiles down streets where the investigators can see.  If you get to one suspect, the investigator wins, if you cannot get to one or Mr Jack acquires enough time tokens Mr Jack wins.  

Very fast game that is strangely addictive.

RATING: 7
For a pocket game this packs a lot of punch. The pieces are well made, with decent art work. I have found that the game heavily favours the detectives, we have experimented a little with only using two of the detective tokens. Once we have a few more plays in, with this house rule, I will re-post and let you know what I think. 
Right now overall I think it is a fast fun game that is easy to toss into your suitcase for a weeks vacation.

Better than Mr jack. It's simpler and more elegant. The identity cards now have more purpose for jack because it now helps jack to win. Rather than jack just trying to outlast the game, now he has tactics beyond just staying hidden. Taking an identity card, as well as being hidden, now both earn jack a point. Jack wins with 6 points. With the right tactics he can win in round 4, rather than having to outlast until round 8. The mechanics make it feel more like a puzzle now though, it doesn't have the same spatial feeling from looking at it. There's no map of london with suspects walking around. It's more of an elegant puzzle with the Jack theme.

This game gets an easy 8 for a few reasons.  It's simple to setup and learn, it's quick to play (games literally only last 10 to 20 minutes), and most importantly it's fun.

The portability of the game is a huge plus as well.  For the $15 price tag it's pretty much a no-brainer.

RATING: 6
Unfortunate choice for title. As portability is least of my worries, if it wasn't for BGG I'd never considered buying, or even checking it out. While keeping the atmosphere and certain elements, the game itself isn't a mini version of the original, but a short, asymmetric puzzle. Too bad, that the tension doesn't come from the hide and seek, but from how many hourglasses any drawn suspect card has. Fun little piece, but because I don't carry games around much, I don't see this chosen over any of its bigger brothers.

Didn't play, but watched my wife play a couple of demo games. Just not nearly as interesting as the predecessor. The "I choose an action, you choose 2, I get the leftover one" really seemed bad. The person choosing actions 2 and 3 can and will leave the remaining action as one of the "You don't have a decision, this simply happens" actions which is frustrating.

Played once and it's too soon to tell. Mr. Jack in NY is listed as 30 minutes but it's usually more like 20 or less. This one however is listed as 15 but it may have been at least that if not longer so the difference in play time isn't as stark. That being said the extra portability is nice. It really is small and compact enough that you don't even need to baggy up the components; they're few enough to separate as you play.

The set up and take down really are a breeze; that being said, based on my first play, it seems less interesting and dynamic than Mr. Jack in NY (which I understand is also more similar to the original than to this). They're certainly different enough that it would be worth having both if you really like both, but how often is portability TRULY an issue beyond conventions. Even my work bag can still hold Mr Jack in New York and how often are you genuinely playing on the floor or a tiny table? So the small size and easy set up are bonuses but not game makers.

In terms of gameplay, I'm unsure if I like this one less or not. Right now, I'm leaning towards liking it less and even though the rules are simpler, I somehow find them, so far, slightly less intuitive. However, I will not judge yet because it may simply need more playthroughs. However, I immediately liked Mr. Jack in NY. Whereas with this one, I wasn't sure at first. May just be the nature of the games so I will withhold judgement until further plays.
---------------
I really like this game as a travel piece. Mr. Jack in New York is still better but this one is quite fun and interesting and good as a pocket game. It's still worth getting even if you have one of the other Mr. Jack games. A nice logic and deduction game.
----------
Update:
I've played this a few more times and it's actually been growing on me. There are more layers of strategy here than the simple but not always intuitive rules would first suggest. Also, the simple set up and takedown make this game great for replay. While less beautiful to look at, the elegance and simplicity of this game really distills deduction and avoidance to a very basic and pure form which is really enjoyable.

A lot of the same fell to it as the "real" Mr. Jack, just a little less a brain burner with somewhat fewer and simpler options, which therefore also plays very fast (10-15 minutes). 
I like both and depending on the time, place and situation both have their purpose. Would from now on probably start with a new player with the Pocket version as it's even faster to explain and already has a lot of the mechanisms in it, although it afterall plays different.

J'ai bien aimé le côté asymétrique du titre même si selon moi c'est beaucoup plus difficile de jouer Jack : la pression est plus forte et les erreurs amènent dans la quasi totalité des cas à la défaite immédiate.
On se prend souvent à faire une ultime revanche tant les parties sont courtes et sympa.

Nice game! This is not exactly Mr. Jack. There are some new mechanics here that alter it somewhat. If you are worried you are buying another Mr. Jack, you may be pleasantly surprised. For me, sometimes I just don't feel like setting up a game of Mr. Jack and this holds me back from playing the game as much. So, this is a nice alternative and you get almost the same feel of the game, just on a smaller and more portable scale.

A really clever reduction of the main game. It replaces all the board movement (in / out of lights), with a simple move around the 3x3 grid (Kupferkessel Co style). After each round you assess whether the three watchers on the outside of the grid can see / not see suspects in the middle (ie can they see down a road on the tiles and are suspects on that road), with a similar rule in / out effect as the original. Actions are moving the watchers and switching / rotating tiles. What it does brilliantly is keep all the agony of the original - ie which action to take, trying to work out what the other player will do, preventing them from taking good actions for them, having good actions yourself which can't be undone. In much less time and at lower cost. Good stuff.

RATING: 9
A tight, fast, tense, asymmetrical, portable 2-player deduction game.. Very cool. Tough and puzzle-y. I believe Jack has a slight advantage over the detectives. I have yet to win against my wife, but I still enjoy this.

I normally hate area/who-done-it deduction games; I love this !! However, I really stink at it.

It really is Mini - Mr. Jack ! Or is it Mr. Mini Jack ? Hmmm.

Looks incredibly good! Love the more serious design and the compact components. A great game. It really feels more like a manhunt this one! Fast and really clever game! A brilliant conversion into something slightly different with a familiar feeling! Brilliant stuff.

A very nice 2-player, assymetric deduction game! I suspect, that the player playing "Mr. Jack" has some advantages over the detective. Will definitely play this  more and most probably heighten my rating.
Update: Wonderful game, lot's of deduction going on. This just feels right with this theme! Very well done! I heightened my vote! May still rise!

RATING: 7
Based on one play: A travel friendly version of Mr. Jack. The game plays very similarly, however the game consists of tiles with paths on them and the inspectors travel around the edge of the board looking down the paths to make the suspects visible or not visible (as is done with the lamps in the regular editions). One player is the inspectors and one is Mr. Jack. Mr. Jack must not be found for eight turns or be not visible for six to win.

great little game, takes no more than 15 min. to play a single game. Initially the game seemed skewed towards the investigators winning but finally played a game where Mr. Jack won.

This has me curious about the full sized game.

Too asymmetric. The outcome of the game is very near a foregone conclusion as Jack seldom wins. Suggesting that two games are played with the players switching roles, is just another way of saying: "Switch roles so that each of you can win one." Lol. If it were more balanced, it'd be a great little game.

I liked may 1 play so far, it has the feeling of Mr. Jack, but still feels different enough. Off course, if Filip is right, that it is impossible to win as Mr. Jack, then there is definitely something wrong with the game, but that I can't judge after 1 play.

This can get awfully short as Mr. Jack can get caught pretty early in the game if the tiles are just setup the wrong way, or if Mr. Jack does fail to see a good way to hide his/her identity. My wife did not like this game much after her first play, so this may slide even further in the scale.

Small, portable deduction game. Clever gameplay where half the available actions are performed on one turn and the other half on the next with one player starting each.

RATING: 8.75
This is quite a different game from the original, not just a smaller version.

It plays in slightly less time, with fewer rules and is a bit less controlled (more random factors). Despite this, it still retains most of the same feel of the original.

I think I actually slightly prefer it too, being quicker & easier to introduce to new people, it is likely to get played more.

WARNING: The components are great EXCEPT for the Alibi cards, which have been cut from the wrong side (AGAIN! similar problem existed in first print of the original game) so it is possible to accidentally notice their colours from the edges even when they are face-down!

Less engaging than the big version, but entertaining.  Not quite as "pocket" as the name might suggest, as there's nothing included to carry it around in besides the box.  And boxes don't go in pockets.  Throw in a bag, and I'll call it pocket.  I personally would've named it "Mr. Jack Small, Irritating Sized-Box Edition." Eh, but whatever.

I’m impressed by this little design. Not only does it retain most of the ‘feel’ of the original, it even improves on some aspects. By carefully pruning the number of possibilities, it makes the game half as long and a lot less overwhelming for new players.

Mediocre heavily brainy game where the odds of winning for Jack stand around 30%.

Drawing a card is really all that matters. I hate that some cards have two sandglasses and some don't have any.

Me ha sorprendido gratamente, cuando lo compre ya habia leido buenos comentarios sobre el juego, pero no me esperaba que estuviera tan bien, de hay mi valoracion.
Cuando leia las reglas no me parecia que tuviera mucha chicha, pero una vez jugado la toma de decisiones es fundamental, que accion escoges?, como ocultas a Jack, moviendolo o desviando la atencion hacia otro sospechoso?, que opciones le dejo al contrario? le beneficio o no me importa que las tenga?, etc....
Se juega en los 15 minutos que anuncia y tiene un precio ridiculo para lo que valen la mayoria de juegos hoy en dia.

Fast little asymmetrical game of deduction. Low price and good production. The street turning and swapping is not thematic though and since the game also aims of being portable, they could have come with a better system than the messy "throwing chips to the air" to randomize the actions available (don't see myself trying to play this in an airplane or on any kind of small table). A good abstract filler with some luck.

This is such a great whodunit cat-and-mouse spatial puzzle.  The action coins are great.  Having to share the available actions with your opponent makes you think several steps ahead.  If I take this action, then my opponent will take that action and nope, wait...that would give him way too much power, so I'd better take this other action instead.  The Android app is awesome, too.

After just a few plays, this seems very difficult for the Mr. Jack character. Maybe it's because we're unconsciously still thinking along the lines of the win conditions of the original game (make it to round 8) instead of the win condition for this game (make it to 6 hourglasses)?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It works as a portable version of Mr Jack that takes the essentials from the board game and packs it into a smaller and faster playing package.

Unfortunately when you've played the full sized games you'll also notice what it lacks. Gone is the subtle reading of your opponents moves with the bluffing that goes with it. Gone is the last minute hail mary accusation when you're down to a couple of suspects and time has run out. Gone is the clever movement around the board and the chasing down of Mr Jack once he's been found. Gone is the sense of building up New York and the atmosphere of putting out lamps and travelling through sewer manholes in London. (Ah, how I fondly remember London sewers...) I miss the treat of Mr Jack escaping the board. I miss the character actions.

The pocket Mr Jack has more luck in it that the full sized games. Players turn over suspect cards with hourglass timers on them. While this makes taking the suspects more attractive to the detective player it also introduces an element of game length luck not in the full sized games. That said, it works well in this light pocket version and as long as you accept that this is a lighter version of the full game it shouldn't get in the way of enjoying the game.

Putting all my gripes aside with comparing the pocket game to the full sized games, you do get a decent little deduction game in a small package that plays in about 15 minutes and is quite a nifty little Mr Jack experience. As a travel game or a game to play with the kids it's worthwhile owning as long as you still have a decent amount of table space are aren't likely to lose the pieces. I can't see myself ever bring it out when I have access to the full sized games, but that's the point here really - it fits in your pocket.

Semmi köze a táblás változathoz, de egy aranyos kis játék a Mr Jack kicsi verziója. Itt annyi a feladata a nyomozónak, hogy leszűkítse egy elkövetőre a gyanúsítottak körét. A gyanúsítottak utcákban járkálnak és Sherlock, Watson és egy kutyus próbálja meglátni őket. Egy-egy kör végén Jack színt vall, hogy látható-e a három személy valamelyikének és ezzel lehet a többi gyanúsítottat kizárni. Rövid játékidő, egyszerű játékmenet, teljesen működő kis játék.

I bought this because Letters from Whitechapel was sold out and I thought it would be a deduction game in vaguely similar vein. It turned out not to be a deduction game at all, but an orientation-based puzzle game. I know it's not fair to rate a game based on what I expected, but from the plays I've had of this so far it hasn't particularly grabbed me.

RATING: 2
Horrible experience. I played this game at a board game cafe instead of purchasing this myself. And I'm SO glad that I did so.
Maybe my friend and I played it incorrectly or something, but we both honestly felt that this was a terrible game all around.

1. It is incredibly imbalanced in favor of the inspector. 
2. The randomness of the tiles and coins make things worse rather than making them more interesting.
3. There was no suspense or excitement. It's a freaking DETECTIVE game for goodness sake. 

Despite all the negative things about this game, there are some redeeming aspects: makes you think (even though planned out turns usually mean nothing in the end) and it's a simple, quick game. However, I will not be playing this game ever again.

Edit: I've lurked BGG for a while, but I made an account just to review how bad this game was. Lol.

A quite cool re-working of the Mr Jack game, retaining the theme and main concepts, but with some different mechanics.  And it's in a tiny box, very portable, and quick to play.  Still some real challenge, and fun.  [Very unforgiving of a silly play - but then that game will be over shortly, and the next game can begin!]  How often do you get a reworking of a good game that also works, or a travel version that's both different and still fun?  Here's one ...

This game is pretty puzzly.  It takes a game or two to get new players to grok how to choose their limited available moves to win as either the Inspector's team or as Jack (or deprive their opponent of some critical move).  I highly recommend the app version of this to play around with as well.  A great cool-off game after a "main" game, I've found.

RATING: 7.5
I am already a rabid fan of all things Mr. Jack and in my opinion, this is a brilliant addition to the series.  They've taken the Mr. Jack theme, distilled it and shrunk it down into a simple, fast-playing, pocket-sized package, and added a new spin on it, all while keeping true to the core game.  Not too shabby!  My only concern is that, with the simplification of the game, luck seems to play a much greater role.  In my first game playing as Jack, at around turn 5 my opponent made a move that left me with no option to counter it, and I lost the game.  Then playing as the Inspector, in turn 2 I made an error and left 6 of the 7 remaining suspects visible, however the 1 suspect I left in the dark turned out to be Jack and there was nothing my opponent could do to counter it again, so I accidentally won the game.  But further experience has made this a much more competitive game.  The components are top-notch, although I wish the artwork used somewhat lighter hues, because it can be difficult to make out characters in low lighting.  And I love the small package, which literally fits in a pocket.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 7.5/10

A very simple, light, easy to learn, fast and fun game. The desing is nice and the theme fits perfectly.

I didn't play the original games but as far as I know this is much more simple with less tactics.This lightness is not necessarlily a problem.

I like the size. The box is realy small, everything fits fine, no unnecessary wasted space and material.

RATING: 8.1
I'm growing less keen to play Mr Jack as the better I (and my opponents) get, the longer the game takes as you have to work out all the possible outcomes. I'm hoping this is a slightly faster, pared down version.

Update: It certainly works in that regard, but it seems as though the initial set-up goes a substantial way to determine who will win the game. 

I'll play further games and then reassess, but currently it doesn't bother me as much as I expected it to.

Further update: Perhaps we had a bad run of weird setups or were just playing badly. The issue seems to have gone away lately, instead just delivering fast, thinky, exciting games.

A lightweight deduction game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[thing=72287][/thing] is, more than a deduction game (in the sense of finding clues and making a case), a game of choosing actions to activate - the deduction falls more in the part of antecipating what actions the other person will pick and what he will do with them. Not what I was expecting, but this isn't bad, as it allows the reading of the board and seek the best advantage point to your side.

The way the game works is neat: in a grid of 9 tiles, each depicting a person, Sherlock, Watson and their dog try to find Jack. Once the round is over, the investigators asks if their investigators are seeing Jack. If they aren't, the persons that the investigators are looking (which can be up to 3, due to connections of streets), are taken out of the suspects and their tiles are flipped. If Jack is being seen, all the persons that the investigators [i]aren't[/i] seeing are flipped, and Jack loses one hourglass. The 8 possible actions are: move Sherlock/Watson or the dog (1 or 2 spaces), move any invesigator (1 space), rotate up to 90 degrees a tile (2x), trade places of two tiles (without changing their direction), and, finally, take a suspect piece (if done by the investigator, the tile of the suspect whose piece was taken is flipped, if wasn't already; if by Jack's player, the piece counts their hourglasses to Jack's goal). The investigator wins by finding Jack (be while looking or by simple elimination), and Jack wins by reaching 6 hourglasses.

[thing=72287][/thing] is a quick, tense, easy to teach and to play game, one that has a small footprint - both in the table as in the box, which has a proper and very well done insert. The box does fit in a pocket.

I liked it because, in spite of being light, the choices matter a lot, and even with the tension, it isn't agressive or mean. There is luck in game - mainly in the draw of suspects tiles, but also in the way the 9 tiles are first prepared and in the set of actions available: the 8 actions will always happen in two rounds, yet the sets of 4 in which they come can help a lot one side. Still, in the way the choices work - you pick one, then the other person picks two, and you do the last one -, brings balance to most rounds, regardless of the set formed. A high amount of thinking for its breezy 15-20 minutes of playing time.

In the end, I liked it and recommend it.

Juego asimetrico para jugar en pareja donde uno adopta el papel de los investigadores y otro el de mr jack. es un juego de estrujarse el cerebro bastante y donde el analisis paralisis aparece casi en cada turno. Eso es lo que no nos gusta del juego. Hay que pensar demasiado y muchas veces todo lo que piensas se va al traste en el siguiente turno por lo que hay que volver a pensar. Aun asi no me importaria seguir echando un par de partidas de vez en cuando ya que a veces gusta darle al coco.

Small game with nice artwork and solid components, that is much more accessible than its big brother and really does play in only 15 - 20 minutes. Even though there are less moves to choose from in a turn than in Mr Jack, careful analysis of the situation is still rewarded and can lead to a very close ending. My girlfriend likes Mr Jack, but cannot get her head around the strategy it requires. The Pocket version focuses on the action selection mechanic with a bit of the same atmosphere.
UPDATE: On one occasion both the investigator player and the Jack player achieved their objectives in the sixth turn. The rules state that in this case, the game continues until the end of the eighth turn or until Jack is visible. Unfortunately, this made the game fall flat for us - it really feels like a design flaw. Luckily, this situation will probably not arise very often.

OMG this game is amazing. The Android version is very well produced as well. The A.I is extremely intelligent. Unfortunately only one-player on Android.

The designers did a really good job of pulling a Knizia and distilling the parts of a larger game into something compact and shorter.  There's still an element of finding the right person among the suspects, and then a game of cat-and-mouse that follows once the suspect list gets narrowed down.  The game isn't as deep, and it seems that it's much easier to narrow down that list of suspects here than it is in the full game, so there's a good chance that playing the pocket version of the game will only make you want to play the full game.  In a way, that's a bit of a failing on the game, but the game is still fun to play; I'm just concerned that hardcore Mr. Jack fans aren't going to find much here to make them want to play this a lot.

What really sells the game is its portability.  This is a game that can be carried in a backpack, more so than Mr. Jack is, and pulled out whenever players are waiting for a meal, a plane, etc.  In those cases, the Mr. Jack fans will find something similar and familiar, if not exactly the same.  It might also win some new fans over to the original game if they play this one first.

This is a great little deduction/abstract game. I love how both sides are difficult and hat staying hidden is not always the best strategy. Wish I could get it to the table more.

A bit new interesting mechanics are added but overall it is simpler than the box version. The core strategy is the same whatsoever.

Really captures the tensions of the larger games nicely, in a quick and portable package.  Ends up feeling a bit drier though--the characters and their special moves are a big part of what I like in the larger games, and those are absent here.  Still, a very impressive, economical design.  A game that will be riding around in my backpack for the foreseeable future.

awesome 2 player deduction game, and what makes it awesome is that it is so small and compact, and is still a great game.  I love pulling this out and I love playing both sides either finding Jack the Ripper or hiding from Sherlock.  Awesome game and I want to try out it's bigger brother Mr. Jack

Quick and easy to pack for the road. But there's very little strategy involved here. Based on which side of the chips you flip, it's pretty straightforward to work out your optimal move. A lot of the time, the starting player of a round has a serious advantage. Meh.

Stunning production values, really, for the size/price of the game.  Nice, thick, linen-textured tiles and tokens.  Very well done!

Definitely an enjoyable game - it seems simplistic, initially, but upon a game or two, you quickly realize there is a LOT of depth hidden in the mechanics.  Not just trying to pick the best move for you, but knowing what is coming up next and trying to 'use up' (IE., waste) an action your opponent could make good use of.  Impressive!

Nice little gem, the rules are easy enough, and the game can be played fast. The only cons for not being a 10 is that there seems to be a difference in the thinking time in my games, Jack seems to always need a longer time to think.

A fun twist on the Mr. Jack theme.  My wife adores Mr. jack, and this one seems to have snagged her as well.  Like Mr. jack, it is an uneven abstract duel, this time based more on tile manipulation than piece movement.  The overall effect is similar, and the compact form means it's great for trips and travel.

Not that great. A 2 player "travel" version of Mr. Jack - which seemed cool when it came out, but Beyond Baker Street is way better, and they are pretty much the same. In both, you're a detective - in Beyond Baker Street you're competing with Sherlock Holmes to solve a case first, in Mr. Jack you're competing with him to catch Jack the Ripper (and competing with the Ripper himself). There are... weird gameplay elements in the 2 player version that just did not work. It was sometimes way too easy for one or the other side. I don't know if further games would allow me to figure out what's wrong with this - if it's just me or fundamental design issues.

Seeing as to how Bruno Cathala is my favorite game designer, and I really like Mr. Jack, this is a must-own for me.

Now that I've played, I can say this game is right up there with its big brother in quality of decisions and components. However, it plays in a third of the time and can be taught to many more folks who would be scared away by Mr. Jack's "puzzleness".

My rating will probably go up by playing more scenario. I really like NW68. It is a system with mechanics very similar to WaW. The fights are nasty and at the end of every scenario there will be a lot of eliminated units. The artillery system especially is very intriguing and devastating. The event table is probably the most interesting thing in the game: while Nazi and Nato fight each other, odds of zealots may spawn here and there adding a lot of spice to the game. The map is a true wasteland: not many covers and place to hide, units are easily exposed and the first 2-3 turns are important to place the unit in strategic places to benefit of terrain modifiers (there is no die rolling for the defender in combat resolution) What really deserves a 10 is the overall story! The scenarios are linked to each other and provide the player with an intriguing storyline. 
Unfortunately, the only downside I find is the overall quality material. The map board warp easily and there are no player aids sheets included in the game. Rules are difficult to read given the low contrast characters but are fairly easy to grasp.

Initial Impression: The theme of the game shines through with the dark, gritty graphics which cloak this game. The background material is well thought out and the story is compelling. To me, the campaign game works well to link the scenarios together and gives a great feeling of continuity. There's now a reason to withdraw from the battlefield and preserve your forces for a future scenario. I absolutely love the chit-pull system and how it's implemented in this game. The appearance of event chits deny predictability to both sides. This game works incredibly well as a solitaire game and the abrubtly ending scenarios leave me with a "let me try that again" impulse. I'm guessing that I'll be playing through all 3 campaigns before I even begin to tire of the game.

RATING: 7.7
Not a bad game, can be a little confusing. A big issue is the board which is shiny and if light is on certain parts of the board then you are unable to see the spaces right. Also the board and warping is a BIG issue I feel that the makers should send replacement boards out. The game loses a big score for this I keep my games immaculate I don't expect the game to destroy itself after I give it love!

RATING: 3
The setting is great, but the rules have more holes than is worth the trouble. The events can radically swing the battle and infinite mine laying seems obscenely powerful for the defender. While near broken out of the box, at least the designer is quickly revising the living rules.

Bought this because of its awesome theme. In my first playthrough I got confused with some of the rules. For example LoS into and from hills are not described clearly in the rulebook, some examples would have been appreciated. After a quick visit here on BGG NW68 forum I found the answers I was looking for. The markers are a little hard to read from the opposite side of the table because of their small size and the stacking of units in hexes. ItÂ´s a fun game nonetheless. This is one of the games I can't wait to play some more.

Decent tactical war game. Uses chit drawn, platoon level counters and seperate stats for infantry, armour and air attack and defence, generaly quite a simple quick playing game. Only played the first scenario for the UN so far, interesting but no quite complex enough for my tastes. Look forward to getting into the story.

Love the fact that this is a Wargame that can be played by three! Had some discussion with the designer about the LOS rules and terrain features, which are a bit different in this game than in most other tactical Wargames. It will be back on the table, but I have to remember to shift my map features to a new LOS paradigm when I play.

Excellent war game with very interesting theme. The post apocalyptic setting brings variety to different factions and their units.

This is one of my favorite games, but unfortunately the production level lowers its score. The rules are quite simple, but the structure of the rulebook is a bit confusing. Visually this game is stunning when compared to other wargames, but the rulebook and board are hard to read. My copy of the game board also has severe warping issues.

I've always wanted to try a lock N load game but this is the first one where the theme really excited me.

After a few games I'm finding he theme very satisfying. There's an exciting balance between turn order and activation choices because unactivated units can snap fire at moving enemy units. The game plays a little two fast in the early missions but I'm sure it will get deeper in later missions.

Nuklear Winter â68 is a new wargame from Lock ânâ Load designed by Petre Tutunea.  It is set in an alternate universe and is billed as a wasteland survival game.  The components are up to Lock ânâ Loads high standards, with colourful glossy counters and mounted map.  A small warning, if you have a thing against brown you may struggle as the map is brown, the box is brown and the rulebook is brown.

In this alternate world the bomb plot against Hitler succeeds and Himmler becomes Furher.  He increases spending on nuclear research and the program speeds up development of nuclear weapons.  In 1945 the Eastern Front is a stalemate and word reaches Germany that the Allies are planning  to drop nuclear bombs to speed up the end of the war.  In 1946 the Western Allies land in France, but are completely pushed back by increased German forces which prompts President Truman to decide to bomb Germany into submission, the first atom bomb is dropped on Frankfurt.  Himmler decides to retaliate and bombs London and Paris with nuclear V-2 rockets.  The US responds by dropping nuclear bombs on Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Dusseldorf.  Germany collapses and becomes a nuclear wasteland.  In 1947 the Allies are unable to control the flood of refugees fleeing Germany and decide to build a wall around the ânuclear zoneâ by early 1948.  1952 sees the first organised attempt to break out of the nuclear zone.  Strange reports come back from the soldiers that the enemy fighters took multiple direct hits before dying.  In the morning all dead bodies had disappeared.  NATO is formed to combat the growing threat from within the nuclear zone.  NATO is made up of the US, all the Western European countries and Russia.

In 1968 Himmler and the remnants of the Third Reich military emerge from hidden bunkers deep beneath German soil.  Determined to rebuild the Holy Roman Empire, Himmler finds himself facing the strange creatures that now inhabit the nuclear zone.  NATO intelligence learns of the German emergence and sends a US-Russian task force to investigate.  This is where the game kicks off.

Nuklear Winter â68 is not a difficult game to play, and it shares many mechanics with other Lock ânâ Load games.  So if youâre familiar with them youâre set.    There are no spotting rules, so you donât have to reacquire targets, and fire combat is simply line of sight.  If you can see it and itâs in range you can shoot at it.  There are rules for command, infantry weapons attached to squads, tanks, APVs, airplanes, helicopters and offboard artillery.  Players activate their sides by drawing activation markers from a cup, though no side is allowed to have more than two activations in a row.

The heart of this game though is the scenarios.  There are 15 of them and they are in chronological order and played one after the other fill you in on what happened after the Germans emerge from their bunkers.  They can also be linked into 3 separate campaigns, one for each of the factions, NATO, Drittes Reich and the Black Hand, the strange inhabitants of the nuclear zone.  Some of the scenarios feature all three factions for 3 player mayhem.  The game also solos well as there is no hidden information and the random activation keeps things tense.

Overall this is a great alt-history wargame.  The large number of scenarios means there is a lot to get through, and the scenarios are quite re-playable as you try and develop tactics for the different sides, who do play differently.  Thatâs enough from me I have to get back to the zone, word has reached HQ that the Black Hand are making another push ...

Really want to like it more however the rules re: mines and smoke are a little lacking (we don't use them now). The theme seemed brilliant however never really seemed to sit with the gameplay. For the time I would rather play one of Lock'n'loads heroes games or for another easy rules wargame play Combat Commander (my wife doesn't really get the additional complexity of the heroes games).

Etwas trashiges Szenario rund um wieder aus ihren LÃ¶chern kriechende Nazis, die NATO und einer Zombie-Fraktion nach einem Atomkrieg; stimmungsvoll, Regeln durchaus nachvollziehbar, ABER: sie enthalten â keine Ãbertreibung â ca. 40 wenig intuitive AbkÃ¼rzungen, die auch bei der dritten LektÃ¼re nicht im GedÃ¤chtnis haften; hier warte ich auf eine Regelversion mit ausgeschriebenen AbkÃ¼rzungen; ansonsten sicher einen Blick wert, schon allein, weil das Spiel auch zu dritt gespielt werden kann.

RATING: 8
All solo plays thus far and I have really enjoyed them. I haven't had much time to explore this; certainly not as much as I'd have liked by now. But here are my thoughts:

[b]Positive[/b]

:d10-1: The theme is great. That's not an uncommon sentence from those on BGG who own this game, but here it is from me. Alternate WWII ending with a sci-fi and occult twist. An alliance between the USSR & NATO versus mutants and Nazis who have lived underground for 20+ years!

:d10-2: Three factions give the game more personality and replayability. They are all unique from one another, though the Black Hand is the most different in it's units and play style.

:d10-3: The components are great. Very nice looking art. The counters are very thick. I like the dark colors on the map and rulebook, contrary to what many others prefer.

:d10-4: As a solitaire experience, each game I played (only a few at that) turned out different from the game before. The chit pull activation method adds variability and tension. I like this better than the traditional I Go/You Go method. This should help to breathe replayability into the scenarios.

:d10-5: The random events table is a great addition. Most of the events, and the most likely to occur, will benefit the Black Hand to the detriment of the other factions. The event table definitely has the ability to unbalance or change the flow of the game.

:d10-6: Combat seems very deadly. It's fun to roll for your armor attack using OPFIRE against an advancing enemy armor unit and blow it up with a good shot. The artillery seems very deadly as well. I haven't had any time to try the aviation rules.

:d10-7: The designer is very active, polite, and helpful on the BGG forums. He asks for input, answers questions quickly, and is a pleasure to communicate with (over the BGG forums). His enthusiasm for his game is evident and his support another great reason to appreciate this game.

:d10-8: 15 scenarios with the base game! And a campaign you can play through with any of the factions! Awesome!

:d10-9: While not designed specifically for solitaire play, you can enjoy the game this way. I have done so already. The chit pull activation makes it easier to do so.

[b]Negatives[/b]

:d10-1: The counters are too cluttered. Information is printed right on the edge, which makes clipping counters challenging.

:d10-2: The mines/sandbags/smoke rules need some work. As currently written, it makes entrenched and supported infantry hard to impossible to dislodge from certain hexes. At least this is the case in Scenario 1 & 2. Either a modification of the scenario to allow more attackers or a modification of the rules would help. Personally, I'd prefer to see the minelaying/sandbagging abilities of infantry reduced or changed. There has already been a lot of discussion regarding this topic on the NW68 forums here. The designer seems to be working on a modification from what I gather. I believe it may be addressed with the new expansion. 

:d10-3: The original rulebook was vague on certain rules. See the forums here for clarification on many rules questions. The designer has promptly addressed any questions that arise and had already released an updated rulebook (PDF) as well as player aids. Hopefully this will not be a problem in a second addition or with the new expansion.

:d10-4: The first couple scenarios are all I have experience with. They seem unbalanced. This may have more to do with sandbag/mines rules as mentioned above. I don't mind scenarios being slightly unbalanced, but those two seem to be too extreme.

[b]Summary[/b]

I think this is a great product that is made even better with the enthusiastic and humble support if the designer. I am leery of expansions because they drain my wallet, but I am excited to see what products are developed in the future that support the core game. I'm sure I'll be picking them up. I highly recommend this to war gamers who want something different, Ameritrashers who want something different, and those who enjoy playing games solitaire/solo.

Bloody awesome. I love the World at War games/system from LnL, this is just as good but not just with a Modern theme, it has a Modern/WW2 and Horror/Sci-fi/Fantasy theme as well!!!! Components are some of the best I have seen, rulebook is a bit hard to read thanks to the dark background on the pages, but very, very impressed with this. Highly recommended to anyone into Modern/WW2/Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror gaming LOL.

Received via BGG trade June 16, 2014. Rules are rather low complexity, background story is interesting. Component quality is very good; do think map is too hard to read. I hand-wrote in the word "sand" on the sand hexes as they are virtually indistinguishable from the clear hexes.Games play fast.

Quite the setting for this game, I greatly enjoy the post-apocalyptic, alternate history backstory. The crazy mutant Black Hand units are very cool, and add a ton to the weird setting. The chit-pull activation and random events seem like welcome additions on an over-the-top theme like this, adding a bit of variety to each game. The scenarios all look interesting, and the campaigns even more so. The fact that it can play 1-3 well is an added bonus. Very pleased with the game overall, it's a fun tactical Weird War 3 game.

I do agree with many others that the game is not one to play seriously, the balance can and will be thrown out of whack with events. Just sit back and enjoy the crazy ride.

RATING: 7
The board is almost unplayably hard to read, with very small hexes necessitating stacking, which wouldn't be terrible except there are some important administrative chits. A clearer map that was twice as wide and long would probably save this game from collecting dust on my shelf.

Post apocalyptic wargame that plays and allows 3 players, need I say more?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Based on solo play of the first 3 scenarios

- Prodigal Sons (Draw)
- Rangers Lead the Way (Black Hand Victory)
- Lifeline  (NATO Victory)

Wont go into details on each game - but overall, like many of the reviews - heavy on theme.  Gameplay is average (Combat boils down to Attack Value + mods (leadership, range) + 2d6 - Armor Value - Terrain.  If posative, damage done.  If negative - No effect.)

Scenarios are either unbalanced or unstable.   For example Rangers Lead the Way - NATO is the attacker and has less units (but of slightly higher quality).   The issue comes in that Black Hand gets the first shot (opportunity fire) and if successful (which it was in this case) - NATO loses its only heavy unit - and it goes off the rails.   Testers claim that NATO can and does win - which comes down to BH missing their shot and NATO killing the BH armor.

That being said, when I was playing Lifeline, I rolled snakes on an event die role and summoned a Raveger - which immediately charged the closest (NATO) unit - killing companies of Rangers, Spetnatz and M113 carriers until it was put down with direct Artillery fire from a Paladin.  All this unfortunately did not help the Germans who were getting ripped apart by the T-64s (which did die in the end).   So, from a narrative perspective - you cant beat that!

Overall, I will keep it - but only for the story/narrative - would definitely not play this in any "serious" setting.  To variable/luck driven (IMO of course).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Interesting wargame, with the typical high standard of components Lock and Load publishing puts out. Solid rules, interesting scenarios, a mounted board to drool over and mutants :)
Only gripe so far is that the post apocalyptic theme is more towards Twillight 2000 than Fallout. I'd prefer more fantasy elements in there, but still, it's a great game.

Take the WaW system, add a zombie/horror theme, darken the board and you get this game. Standard chit quality from LnL but the board quality is finally top notch. Has a good sting of scenarios that feed on each other and keep things interesting. If you like the WaW series, this one will be a nice departure from reality for you.  Nice mix of late WWII and early Cold War armor and units. Too bad the rule book is printed so dark. It's the only complaint I have.

Alternate history science fiction WWII era war game. Germany transformed into a mutated wasteland after a nuclear conclusion to the war. New home of the Black Hand. Area movement zerg culminating into a three way battle between NATO, Blackhand, and Nazis. Scenarios and events mix things up. Combat modifiers for hard and soft targets, range, concealment, shaken units, move and attack. Destroyed assets provide cover and obstacles. Small tiles with small text, have your reading glasses handy.

The background story is really cool.  The Black Hand faction has some interesting units.  That being said, the rest of the game is standard LnL fare (both good and bad).  The ranges/firepower/armor of some of the units are bizarre and unrealistic.  Infantry can be surprisingly difficult for tanks to kill. While it uses a combat system similar to Corps Command, it is much deadlier when it comes to damage. Some of us felt the game needed more play testing to work out the quirks.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I like the back-story, the scenarios and the factions. It's a creative design. However the rulebook is not great (designer needs to get a thicker skin on this point...). The rule allowing infantry to spam unlimited mines sours the game, but it is easy to ignore or house-rule. That would raise my rating.

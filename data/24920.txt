Very good lighter war game.  Area control to the max.

RATING: 9
My favorite of the area impulse games. Easy on the complexity, could be a great gateway and also playable in under 3 hours. Another solid Japanese design about that famous turning point.

Update: played it again...still not sure whether the Germans can win or not (seem mighty difficult). Interestingly enough original Japanese rules included divisional integrity for the Germans as an optional rule, the removal of which could make it easier on them (then again the MMP version upgraded the German Overrun card, so could be somewhat of an offset). Will need to play a few more games.

RATING: 7.5
Perhaps the crappiest, most expensive components I have ever bought. MMP should hang their heads in shame at what they produce. The designer should be very proud however as this game poses two radically different  forces against each other (most of the Russians have no guns!) in a tightly balanced, to the wire experience.

Excellent game of area control-impulse about the battle of Stalingrad.
Competitively played, very tense and hard for both sides.
The use of cards as support assets (artillery, snipers, sappers, commands, etc) give a wonderful touch to this title.
Clear mechanics and simple rules made this game a great entry to the Area system wargames.

SoS can be played in 2:30-3:30.

RATING: 7
An incredible design.  For 6 pages of clear rules, you get a simple-to-learn game that captures much of the battle's feel: Soviets throwing bodies at stopping the superior German troops.  Frustrated Germans who cannot roll over an inferior, but determined enemy; building-to-building fighting in a meat-grinder, and sacrificing your own (Soviet) troops in order to hold a building!  It's all there, and it's easy and deep all at once.  Wow!

This game is alot of fun. Easy to understand area impulse game. Lots of choices and strategy involved but still some randomness from the tactical cards and die rolls. Plays decent as a solitaire game as well. Have not played it f2f yet.

I’m a huge fan of pretty much every IGS game I’ve played, most specifically Warriors of God and Angola. I love area-impulse games. But there’s something about SOS that not only didn’t connect, really left me scratching my head. I understand the nature of street fighting and Stalingrad specifically, but the game system feels like nothing more than a repetitive, attritional slog with few interesting decisions. Push ahead one area trying to put together another 10:9 or 10:8 attack and hope you roll big. Even taking into account it’s a low-rules-overhead game with a higher level of abstraction –- and that’s perfectly cool with me if executed well –- it generated little imagery or story, which I need. 10:9, roll; 10:9, roll; 10:8, roll -- again and again. I know a lot of people like this game, so maybe it’s a me thing, and I’m willing to admit that could be the case.

I really like this game. Area impulse with tactical cards. Nice big counters. Not cluttered with special rules and the rules are relatively short and simple to understand. Capable of being played to completion in one sitting. I must say, I have become an area impulse fan provided the rules are not too complicated.

RATING: 9
Love it!  It was a blast, and really had a good feel for the battle, I think.  Germans are pushing and pushing and killing anything in their way, the Russians are holding and slowing them down, and in the end the German advance just has either BARELY enough to get the job done, or BARELY enough to fail.  Really just a wonderfully done game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Came into this knowing nothing about the actual battle, and knowing would have helped me know about how the Russians were basically there to survive abuse.  It's implicit in the victory conditions, but I drastically overestimated the ability for the Russians to go on an effective offense.  We restarted our first game after a couple of turns, and the second went much better.  Took around 3 hours to complete, with the Russians having a 10-unit lock on 3 territories to secure the win - while holding nothing else.  I wish the Russian side could do more interesting things to defend themselves than go for opportunistic pickoff attempts.  Could revisit.  I'm fine with paper maps, found the split one here annoying.  Also didn't enjoy checking the other side of spent Russian units when deciding which ones to kill.  Reading about the battle on Wikipedia after playing has significantly revised my interest level. After a replay years later, this surged from a 6 to an 8. Guess wargame experience has a lot to do with it. Only real beef at this point are the retreat rules which permit taking over territories and multi-hopping.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First Impression: Here's a game with a really simple ruleset which encompasses alot of depth. I love the asymmetrical play, with the Germans having many strong units already deployed at the start of the game and the Russians performing stalling tactics long enough to get their troops on the board and create a viable defense. The back and forth style of play creates a fast paced, flowing game with low number crunching. Note to self, unit cohension is VERY important.

I've played this game just once via Vassal and I lost too. These two factors may have impacted my negative impression of the game. I see that the tactical maneuvering required to do well but I simply did not have fun playing this. It just seemed like a chore. I would be willing to play it again face to face.

RATING: 7.5
Storm Over Stalingrad ("SoS") is a asymmetrical area impulse game.  With the exception of a few card interpretations, the rules are clear, only 8 pages long and easy to comprehend.  Despite the simplicity of the rules, the game offers players meaningful decisions at every turn.

As one would expect, the Germans are a powerhouse attempting to push back the Soviets as efficiently as possible and the Soviets are the valiant underdogs trying desperately to hold on to their territory at all costs.  

SoS only takes a couple of hours to play and there is very little downtime as such, it is a great game to play with casual wargamers.

Pretty decent fun. First play through i only lost one German unit, Soviets lost stacks of em and i won quite handily. It put doubts in my mind as to how this game reflects the actual battle. Felt very much like a walk in the park...very long shot from what is arguable the hardest fought urban battle in history. Nothing like the desperation factor of Arnhem or Cassino which i've played alot.

Not a world-beater, but not bad for what it is, I think. It's possible to quibble with a bunch of little stuff: the retreat rules can lead to some strange situations, and the Germans probably have too many counters, given how infrequently it makes any sense at all to split up the dinky brigades of infantry.

But, given that it's quite straightforward and short, and that the cards add some nice spice, and that it's inexpensive, I liked it. Of all the IGS games I've played, this has come closest to hitting the sweet spot between playability, game length, and decision-making engagement. Of course, that's a low bar; most of the IGS games have been painfully long.

Anyway, this is a good, satisfying, weekday evening game which you won't struggle with the rules for. There is always a niche for that it my collection. While it certainly isn't anywhere near the game that Avalon Hill's Turning Point: Stalingrad is, on the other hand, it isn't trying to be.

OK, well, I do have on complaint: it's ludicrous that they make you bid on victory conditions even for your first game. A lot will depend on how quickly the German player groks the system (which rewards division-sized sledgehammer blows rather than battalion-level fire-and-maneuver, even though counters are brigades), but a 3 bid seems a sane level for your first game. Two seems pretty aggressive. 4 is conservative.

RATING: 9
Phenomenal game! The rulebook is a masterwork of clarity and simplicity as the cards allow for all the "chrome" that would otherwise have to be in the rules. The game plays quickly and stays remarkably true to history for such a simple game. It's an absolute blast to play and despite the asymmetrical nature of the cards, it is a very balanced game. The Germans can bomb the hell out of the Soviets, but the soviets have tons of units to take those hits. It's a terrific game.

RATING: 8
The area/impulse game continues to please in the hands of designers willing to move outside the box (and it's not bad for the more traditional style either). In this case the addition of cards makes for a rollicking game; I'm not sure the tournament player will approve but it's not like he lacks games to play.

Maybe it is a nice 2-player light wargame. Maybe it has tension and tough decisions. Maybe it has some fun.

But clearly it has nothing to do with Stalingrad, simulation of the battle is an epic fail. Try this set of rules for eg Tobruk and you have a descent game. Now you have a joke.

Storm Over Stalingrad was not much fun to play.  I play war games to "live" the history.  This game never made me feel like  I was doing anything but pushing cardboard, flipping cards and rolling dice.  Not much flavor.  I don't know how else to describe it.  

My first area/impulse game was Monty's Gamble (brilliant game) so I had high expectations for other area/impulse titles. This could be a factor in my impression of SoS.

as everybody says : nice, easy to learn, fun with the add of cards to the system. 6 games with 3 different opponents so far, and still fun. This game is smart. The objectives and strategies are clear and simple, even for a newbie after one or two games. But the cards make you always need to adapt your plan to a new situation.

It is far to be THE ultimate stalingrad game, but it has everything to become a classic. I'm sure we'll still play it from time to time in ten years. Perfect when a friend come home with 2hours to spend.

It's also perfect to initiate newbies or eurogamers wanting to try a wargame.

RATING: 8
Just a really fun game.  It is tense the whole way through.  Many of my games have come down to the last turn with the Germans trying desperately to finish off the last bit of Russians.  I highly recommend it for the price, and the ability for the game to be friendly to beginners.

I'm no veteran of wargaming but love the history of Staligrad so had to seek out a copy.  I very please with the game. Simple to learn and rule light but this asymmetric game somehow really captures the painful Struggle and swings in fortunes for the Axis and Soviets. Looks great and the card assisted play really brings the theme out. Took about 150 minutes to play in it's outing.  I would say many euro gamers would enjoy this area control game if they can accept the fate of rolling dice to resolve combat  A keeper for me and hope it's reprinted so more can discover it.

Bought this after Crusader Rex after a comment on game design by a friend (let complexity arise from the fact you are playing a human adversary, not from the system). Yeah, the light really went on there. 

So, I've soloed this once. Maybe three hours total. There is some subtle play here. I admit I underestimated it on first glance. Recon units actually serve a purpose. Think the wife will appreciate it.

RATING: 6
Contrary to what the back of the box says, this game is not particularly solitaire friendly, as there is hidden card play and a bidding mechanism to determine victory conditions.  That’s too bad, because the situation lends itself to a solo approach, as the Germans have the initiative throughout and the Soviet player basically wins by hanging on. Still, a pretty good game on (the early part of) the epic battle, with mercifully short rules, relatively quick playtime (6 turns max), and nice-looking components.  Some language on the cards and in the rules is too imprecise for my taste, but doesn’t really hinder play.  A Player Aid card referencing damage point allocation and the like would have been nice.

7/15/2011 - BGG member "Septic", aka Max Coffey, bought me this game in order that we should have something to play during his visit to Pittsburgh. A nifty 'lite' version of "Storm Over Arnhem" area-impulse game. Seems like there are plenty of choices for each side. I could see that after a number of plays, there may be found 'optimal' moves for each side, but dice and cards should keep replayability fairly high.

A couple plays in, it's decent. This is more or less a streamlined [i]Turning Point: Stalingrad[/i] I suppose. Basically, it's the Sawmill scenario as its own smaller game, with a simplified combat system, and cards to replace the Luftwaffe, Russian artillery, and other abstractions. The playing time comes in at an easy 3 hours or so.

If that's what you're looking for, then this is the game for you. If you want a deeper, but longer area impulse game on Stalingrad, then TP:S is the game you want instead.

Personally, I think TP:S is the slightly better game, as the cards can fall in a strange order, giving you a less than ideal narrative. On top of that, the fact that there's no downside for the attacker when rolling low means that the Germans can use a "Knizia" style approach to attacking (to borrow an SFB term), and eventually you'll get that high-low combo. But, it's still relatively fun once in a great while, and it's easy to finish in a single sitting.

This is one of my few plays of a true "war game."  I usually shy away from them because either they're too long or they're too complicated, but mostly because when it comes to playing them, I suck large volumes of canal water.  However, I was willing to give this a try because my best friend is a huge war game fan, and he was really excited about this one.  
 The system was unique to my experience.  Not quite a typical war game operation.  It's really cool that you bid for how many areas the Russians have to control at the end of the game for victory conditions, with the person who bids higher getting to be the Russians.  I also like that the game is not open-ended.  You have a set amount of turns, and whoever meets the victory conditions at the end, wins.  For the Russians, it's pretty much a matter of trying to hang on and survive, which I guess that's pretty much the way it was at the real battle.  Anyway, while not my favorite by a long shot, this was enjoyable - especially because I won.  I'd be willing to try it again.

The area control mechanic makes this more operational than tactical. The play is tough for the Germans...as it should be...and bloody for the relentless Soviets. Not my standard take on a "war game" because of the area mechanic being new to me, but I did enjoy it quite a bit.

RATING: 9
A simple game with a very nice back-and-forth, and playable in one sitting. With a two-week per turn design, the Russians have more opportunity to counter-attack during the game, compared to TP: S, where the Russians spend six hours just absorbing attacks from the Germans. 

The bidding system is interesting, although it seems like deviating from 2 or 3 would be madness, which means that most games will be down to the wire.

If you have played any area-impulse game before, this one is very easy to learn.  If you have played several area-impulse games before, you will find the general strategy here easy to determine.

It seems hard for the Germans to win but that might change with more experience playing the Germans side. The challenge right now is to see how well the Germans can do.

After 4 plays, I think that with basic competent Russian defense, bidding 3 or 4 will make an interesting game with 3 leaning to Soviet's favor. It'll be hard to convince me that I have the skills to  win as Germans with a bid of 2.

Production quality is awful. OK, it's a nice box. Do they understand the meaning of "die cut"?

Punching out the pieces takes a lot of time, and every one of them has a hanging chad, if that is the proper term. This will probably be my only MMP game as I do appreciate quality counters as well as game play.
It adds significantly to the enjoyment of the game.

In this day and age, do we still have to use tiny counters?
Well, they are better than some of the LnL games that have reams of information printed on their tiny faces.

The rulebook seems like it is tightly written and it is beautifully presented. If the game plays as nicely as the rulebook looks, this will be a winner.

fingers crossed

Very impressed after my first play. The complexity is in the play, rather than in the rules.

SOS is an area impulse game but a whole lot simpler than TP:S and you'll probably play the game through to the end every time you get it on the table. The cards add the chrome, they don't drive play. This can be a tense game and is a tough contest all the way to the end.

This is an interesting update to the area/impulse game system first presented in Storm Over Arnhem.  The obvious comparison will be to AH's Turning Point:  Stalingrad and this game fares well (I have played TP:S many times).  The rules are concise (only 7 pages of actual text), clear, and the addition of the tactical cards certainly make the player interaction interesting.  Overall, this is a very good game.  My only quibble is with the very thin counters and the cheap and nasty cards, but graphically the game looks very nice, especially the map and rulebook.

Entertaining enough but a little long and the low complexity is both nice and frustrating (in the sense that it sometimes makes the game feel more superficial than the old TPS).

I like it well enough but I don't see it becoming a favorite.

RATING: 2
Fairly fun system, but unrealistic to the point of broken.  I can't prove it, but I swear the system was designed for platoon combat where each side shoots at each other.  In applying a tactical combat system to battalions it leads to crazy results.  The German can go into the meat grinder of Stalingrad and suffer no losses, primarily because nothing bad can happen to them when they attack.

RATING: 6
RULES: Easy and well explained 

HISTORY: Very Good at the Strategic Level. I felt like I was commanding the armies for the proper strategic reasons. Play creates a good believable narrative of the battle

GAME: Both sides have exciting decisions to make and options to choose from. The Cards add tension and surprise. Within the overal strategic choices there are many tactical decisions like who fires, who moves, who retreats and....who dies. Balance is self corrected via the bidding system. I beleive that German success depends on his ability to focus and orchestrate his divisions and cards into a cresendo of doom for the Soviets

One nice change is that a unit's defensive strength has an average dr added in (so a 4 strength unit is rated as 11 on defense) thus speeding up the game by removing a dr that other Area-Imp games have.

OVERALL... Great Fun, excellant competion and good history

RATING: 7
An easy "8" after one play. My first game took 4 1/2 hours, and either I want to get this down to three in a hurry so as to enjoy the rhythm of it, or I'd like a bit more chrome. For example, it was nice to see Chuikov in the Russian deck..., a few more details like this would be nice. But, if we get down to three hours, that'll probably fall by the wayside. 

Storm Over Stalingrad is an "area impulse" game, which means the map is sectioned off into a dozen or so main areas as an alternative to hexes. Each side may concentrate up to 10 units (Brigades) in a single area. On your turn, you "take an impulse," which means you select an area, activate some number of units in that area as a group, and either move them (according to a movement rate) or pool their firepower for an attack on enemy forces in the same area (in which case you "go under" defensive terrain bonuses - the advantages of street fighting) or an adjacent area (where the enemy will be dug in, if they are in control). Movement bogs down when enemy units hunker down in the same area, which turned out to be extremely significant for restricting your opponent's options. Each turn you either move or fire. Movement opportunities are scarce in a six turn game, but so are opportunities to do lasting damage (which requires a lot of combined fire). I get the feeling that the game rewards clever maneuvering in the first half of the game. After that, you're mostly making small adjustments as you whale on each other.

The Germans, not surprisingly, have superiority in terms of movement and firepower, but their command structure deteriorates as the game goes on, so if the Russians are able to strike heavy blows against the different German divisions/armies/brigades in play, they can severely reduce the potency of German assaults. There's a lot of satisfying attrition in the game. We saw roughly 30 casualties (whole units) perish on each side by the end of the game, with all of Western Stalingrad bled white as the final contest played out near the Dherzhinski Tractor works. 

It's a fairly simple game at heart: pin down enemy movement; retain control of the most defensible regions (the vulga), muster massive attacks when you can (otherwise you will merely stun or chase off units, and not inflict any permanent casualties), coordinate these heavy blows when you can to finish off reeling enemy forces, use your cards wisely, keep an eye on reinforcements.

Another great effort by MMP. Rules are mostly straight forward (only about 3.5 real pages of rules - not counting the title or components pages or the examples of play or the credits) with very little FAQ or errata. Well drawn, functional map, counters, and cards. Card quality is not up to a Shifting Sands standard, but good enough (I sleeve'em anyway). 

Game play - due to the constant switching of player impulses and card play - is fast, extremely engaging (zero player downtime), and tensely fun. It can be completed in under three hours. 

Having played multiple times on each side, it also appears to be well balanced. On my 2nd game it came down to one die roll on the last turn.

Although the endgame revolves around the same few riverside areas the replayability is high because of the cardplay. The historicity of German and Russian strategies is excellent.

Nice components. Simple rules. Perhaps too simple. I loved the game mechanics of unit cohesion in Storm over Arnhem (where you get a bonus for 3 units from the same Platoon) which is not present in this game... probably to balance the game since cards are used in conjunction with area-impulse moving. Still a fun area-impulse game and good introduction to war games. Only downside is the map which is coated paper and needs a plexiglass cover to keep it flat.

Another game on Stalingrad...this time a Japanese view.  After play, I was astonished by this game.  The area movement impulses system suits the situation so much that it is a blast and breathless to play.

Only 8 pages of rules.  This is by no means a simple game nor is it a complex one.  You almost start the game right away after setting up.  The rules are simple but well written and comprehensive.  No loophole or inconsistency.  All the rules make sense except that terain modifier is lost whenever an area having units firing, regardless how many they have fired.  It suggests that one unit fire can expose all the rest in the area.  
 
The game stormed me. Before this game, I really had not delved into the area-movement-impulse system deep. I avoided Breakout Normandy and Storm over Arnhem before. This game really changed my impression about the system. 

The impulse-driven gaming system means that you have to decide what to do with the unit in a particular turn. It either perform a movement, rendering it a "spent" status, or perform a combat against enemy units at the adjoining area. The area (note: not the units) that fired would be placed a "Fired" marker, losing the TEM modifier that is assigned to each area. This simulates units' susceptibility to enemy targeting fire after exposing the units' whereabout when attacking. However, the rules apply to all units in the area, no matter how many units actually were firing. 

I have some minor quibble about this "exposing-one-exposing- all" approach. The German side is generally disadvantaged by this rule as it is the attacking side in this early stage of the campaign. But given that this is basically not meant to be a complex design, it is quite understandable with a rationalization that the Germans are the one who are not familiar with the city than the Soviet. 

All the famous areas are present: Red October Factory, Red Barricades (the Barrikady Gun Factory) Mamayev Kurgan (capture of which would reduce the Soviet cards hand size by 1 and increase 1 to the German), and finally there lies the Volga river! New Soviet troops landed on one of these 3 ferry landings on the Volga would move out on a unit by unit basis (one unit from each ferry landing each turn action). 

The tactical cards are the cards that give the side's special capabilities in movement or combat according to the actual advantages both sides had during the battle. For example, the German generally have more cards in every turn than the Soviet, reflecting their localized superior tactical capacity. Many cards call for the Luftwaffe level or dive bombing or off-board artillery bombing. They are very useful to soften up the Soviet defense units in an area first, before the Germans' attack or move-in. the Soviets cards are primarily defensive one like Chikov in command to restore all spent units in an area and additional defensive firepower of 6 to 8.

The allocation of damage points in the combat system is the most interesting part in the game. All the attacking units' attack strength are added up first plus the roll of two dices. The sums is compared to the the one highest rated defense strength in the defending units plus the area's TEM. The positive difference is the amount of damage points inflicted on the defenders. The defender player can choose to allocate the damage points by either turning the unit to the "spent" side, retreating or eliminating the defending units. The best combination of the options to satisfy the damage points required can really affect the course of the development of the battle. When to retreat and when to defend? With an average breadth of 3 areas on the horizontal, the timing to make the right decision can cost you the game. The combat system is amazingly true to capture the essence of the problems and decisions facing the combat commanders at that time and place. 

The game lasts only for 6 turns. It is perfectly suitable for a day game session between 2 players in 7 to 8 hours. Stalingrad is not a place to maneuver with and the flipping mechanism is very elegant to simulate the back-and-forth-no-retreat situation in city fighting, landscape of which had been severely changed due to heavy bombings and artillery shelling.  

Overall, it's one of my all-time top ten classic wargame.  Storm over Stalingrad is the closest suspense I can get into - the suspense of both sides hanging in the balance and possible instant collapsing at every moment.  The game arouses my interest in area-movement impulse system game.  I have to pull out games like Turning Point: Stalingrad, Thunder at Cassino and Not War but Murder and study them hard! But wait...first, I can try the designer's own A Most Dangerous Time: Japan in Chaos, 1570-1584! Pretty awesome!

3 / 5 - Good.

This was a really pleasant surprise - a very engaging yet very simple wargame that hits the strategy vs random ratio bang on the head. I was also pleased to discover that unlike many wargames with entrenched attack and defence roles, playing the defender in this one is actually a lot of fun. The quickfire i-go-you-go system and the hidden actions cards keep things really tense and making good timing of the right moves a key part of the strategy. Great stuff!

08/31/13 Played part of one game (2 of 6 turns). 
The overall look of the game was nice. Though I'm not a fan of tiny half inch counters. Trying to see the combat and movement factors on them was often tedious. The board looked nice. The cards were so thin and flimsy the owner *had* to put them in card sleeves. Their text and artwork (period photos) were adequate. As to how the game played, I liked the way combat worked; it was new to me. But what I have to take points off for is the fun factor. Being the German and being able to constantly attack can be enjoyable even if not all attacks work as hoped. At least you feel like you are doing something. Whereas as the Russian I spent 90% of turn 2 doing nothing but moving one unit at a time up to the front from the ferry landing areas. Essential, yet BORING AS HELL. For mainly that reason I rated the game a "4". Sure, it may be historically accurate in that's what the Russians did. But that makes it the opposite of a fun game for the Soviet player. Pity, for there are several good things about the game, but the boredom factor eventually outweighs them all. So I'm glad I didn't have to do that today for four more turns. Therefore I'd rather never play this game again.

Though it's been a while since I played Storm Over Arnhem, this one's very similar to what I remember.

It's tense, tough, goes down to the end, inspires a little analysis paralysis if you get too deep into it and there are lots of very cruel card plays.

I'm more of a Western Front, paratroop, commando operation kind of guy, so the topic here is not as interesting to me. However, it seems like a very good game that would be fun to replay many times.

After two plays, one on each side, I'm very comfortable giving it a strong '8' rating. The Soviets have a little less to do, pass reasonably often and often are just biding their time. But I don't know that this is a huge problem, and maybe it's not even a problem at all.

Not a bad little game.  Loosely based on the Original Avalon Hill's "Turning Point Stalingrad" (TPS).  Area movement, simple combat mechanics and a card hand to help balance (or imbalance!) play.  A fair bit lighter and faster than TPS but similar in style.  Lacks some of the nice features of TPS (variable turn length and unit recoveries etc) but a good solid game.

To win the game the Soviet player needs to control a predetermined number of 3 defensive level areas (usually 2 to 4) at the end of turn 6.  There are 7 of these areas: tractor factory, gun factory (Northern ferry location), October factory, the tennis racket (Central ferry location) railroad station one (Southern ferry location) grain elevator, and railroad station two.   Soviet reinforcements (one at a time) must transit via the ferry landing's so these locations must be held or it's almost impossible to win.  For a game with a short rule book it does a great job of capturing the feel of this battle:  mass casualties and the Russians desperately trying to hold on.  Quite interesting!

But I think that the combat system make the game less fun than could be:
the defence points are known before the battle (defence points of unit plus terrain effect and cards) and only the attacker points plus die determine the result of the battles. After are compared the defence points and attack points.
I think that could be more funny if it was needed a "die" also for defender and so should be more uncertain. 
For make this should be needed more different defence points of units than are now.

Simple rules, but more ambiguity than there should be. The card play really makes it interesting. Most decisions relate not to what you're doing, but the order in which you execute your actions. 

Balanced thanks to bidding. Germans attack and should have early success, Soviets hold on and defend, mostly. Not a lot of room for maneuver, but I'm OK with that. Makes it work better solo, where surprise movements can't work. 

Edit: after even more plays, I'm impressed with the tough decisions you have to make in this game. It holds up.

This is a great little game. Fast playing, simple to learn and play and with a real feel of the toing and froing of the battle and the frustrations of a slow slog through the city without being bound up by rules and charts. You might even get non-wargamers interested!

My one quibble is that the Germans don't get to interdict the river. In the actual battle this is what most of the divebombing was about. The Russians get to bring in reinforcements scot-free. This is maybe necessary for game balance, I'm not sure, and I know it isn't a simulation just a fun game on the theme. However, I feel it would add to the flavour. You could have the reinforcements shuttled across the river i.e. one on the ferry landing, one in the river and the others on the other side moving in chain across. If the German player gets the dive bomb card and wants to use it to interdict and gets the right score he can only finish off three at most and the odds are longish. It would slow down reinforcing but it might unbalance the game. I shall try something like this and see if it seriously affects game dynamics.

Good game though for a couple of hours fun, nice pace, highly recommended.

Iba con la idea de que el juego se haría algo pesado ya que son bastantes fichas repartidas por el mapa y para hacer las acciones con todas ellas y durante el mantenimiento del turno, todo se iba a ralentizar. Pues para nada, la partida ha sido tensa desde el turno uno y debido a esto, cuando mi oponente estaba haciendo su turno yo no hacia mas que dar vueltas a las acciones que tenia que realizar, los entre turnos y el mantenimiento de estos se me han pasado volando.

Los 6 turnos de que se disponen son muy ajustados, en mi caso, hasta el turno 5 todavía veía posibilidades de ganar, he jugado con los alemanes y me ha quedado claro que no hay tiempo que perder, hay que atacar y avanzar lo mas rápido (y seguro) que se pueda.

Las cartas a parte de dar croma al juego, consiguen dar vuelcos a las estrategias de los jugadores.

Por todo ello me ha gustado bastante el juego y ya estoy deseando probar con los soviéticos.

I bought this one on Ebay because it is about Stalingrad and I didn´t expect anything great, just because I thought It would be another area/impulse game as many others. But when it arrived, I decided to give it a chance, then I discovered a really great gem. The big difference against other area/impulse games are the strategic cards. It captures all the Stalingrad tension with Germans capturing an area just to loose it in the next impulse due to a counterattack. Players never know which cards the opponent is gonna play so decisions are taken in a matter of seconds and they can turn the fate of the match absolutely. If you like to feel the tension of Stalingrad without spending your whole life trying to learn a complex system, just get a copy of this one and start playing. By the way, the cover picture (a work of russian photographer Emanuel Noievich Evzirikhin) is one of the few ones available about a statue of a group of kids dancing around one alligator. The sculpture was built in 1933 and it was a fountain known as Barmaley or Druzhba, what means "Friendship" in Russian. It was in downtown Stalingrad in Privokzalnaya square. The sculpture was based on a kids tale by Kornei Ivanovich Chukovskii written in 1929. Curiously, the tale adviced children about not traveling to Africa because it was full of wicked alligators. The fountain was so damaged that a new one was built and set up on the actual Volvogrado. Pictures avalaible here http://www.volfoto.ru/volgograd/vokzal/fontan_horovod/photos/?gallery=5

Rating base on 2 games. Not what I thought it would be, I pretend that you can leave aside the graphics on the map and exchange the counters for coloured tokens and the game would be the same. Nothing of a conflict simulation, a pure math game. IMHO.
Components are excellent. The rules are clear and precise.
Game flow is very interactive.

One play. Liked it. I played the Russians and definitely got a sense of what it must have been like trying to hold onto a piece of the city in the face of thousands of German troops. Germans have their work cut out for them as the Russians concentrate their forces along the river in the highly defended regions. Easy to learn - plays in less than 3 hours. Probably less than 2 for the experienced.

Debated the game play weight for a bit.  It's very very easy to pick up and play -- the set-up will take longer than digesting the rules.

Some very smooth gameplay with simple rules creating surprisingly subtle nuances throughout the game. Very impressive.

Stalingrad in a sitting -- can't go wrong with that.

A lot easier to play than Turning Point Stalingrad which makes it one's best choice to get into the area impulse type games. The cards as others say don't drive the game like For The People but aid in making SOS play a bit different each time it is played. With the bidding it makes it hard to know who won playing it solitaire and the cards do add to that. It has made me more interested in area impulse games. I liked the art work on the cover of the box. I beleieve SOS would appeal to the hardcore and begining wargamer.  
Added later
The components seem cheap when to compared to GMT products, wished they used larger counters with bigger print. I believe the victory conditions weren't thought out well for a person playing it solitaire. Also how could you justify the Soviet player using the Sewer Movement card to move an armored unit? I lower my rating after playing SOS again. More like a game than a simulation.

TPS was the only one of the four original area impulse games I haven't been able to catch at a good price, so this game - which may even be better - fills that spot for me.

Above average and tense simulation that can be played in one afternoon.  All the chrome is in the cards which makes it easier to learn.  TP Stalingrad is probably a better overall simulation, but also more complex and takes longer to complete.  Which one to play would come down to how much time you have, both are fun.

Stalingrad played fast, easy and furious? Interested!

We have a few games already and liked it. Replay value doesn't seem all that high once the strategies are known.

A detailed Historical Research AND a very easy to play game on the BATTLE OF STALINGRAD. For everybody.

The map is wonderful.
Counters are awesome (in both graphic and historical research)
Cards: I don't like card driven games, but this is an exception.
Rules Manual: easy and quick.
Gameplay: for evrybody

NO SUPPLY, NO PRODUCTION, NO STRATEGY, NO LOGISTICS.

Final verdict: this is the best wargame to get noobs in the mood, without making them scared of the wargames' universe.

The elegance of the rules and simplicity of play get high marks in my book.  I'm a fan of Stalingrad games and this one makes both players work for the victory. The cards add nice tension to the game and are really what makes it shine.  I have the re-released MMP version.

Very nice area movement map, and the action cards feature relevant period photos unique to the armies played. The rules are clear, concise and colourful. This is a great quality and fun intro wargame perfect for that first step beyond Memoir '44. My 10-year old son and I play it frequently.

Bid high (4 positions) to give younger/less experienced players some leverage with the Germans.

A fun game, but probably too long for me these days.  Our first two plays took about an hour per turn.  I'm not sure that it would speed up with more play because it seems that there are a variety of ways to attack, each of which needs to be evaluated as it happens.

Pros:  Quick simple rules
Very easy to understand rulebook with good examples
Little downtime, fast playing

Cons:  I'm lukewarm on area impulse games
Due to movement rules and movement allowances, your infantry units can gets bogged down and be unable to move, especially for Germans
Meanwhile, you can end up with many units from different divisions in an area that can't do any damage
Dice can overwhelm combat - gets annoying when you can't do any damage despite 4+:1 advantage, yet they keep damaging you
Game play was OK with some interesting decision, but too much of a slog

I do like the games in the series that are built upon the Storm over Arnhem game (area games). This is a modification on this series. The cards do not add much to the game in my opinion, they are too similar to each other. Some of them have a strong effect, but that only adds some randomness. I lack some of the staying power of the units in Turning Point Stalingrad, even if this game is far better balanced. In the end it never really felt like Stalingrad, it is far too fluid for that.

RATING: 7
My first area impulse game and I really enjoy it for what it is. The cards are brutal and have a huge impact. While simple it does a reasonable job of giving a feel of some of the aspects of that battle. 
I am however appalled by what you get for the money (£32), 2 paper maps, 3 dozen thin chits, some thin cards and just the one scenario. It will be sold as soon as the interest starts to wane.

My first try at a war game (besides ASLSK) and I seriously enjoyed this one. Rules were easy to grasp even for a beginner. I enjoyed the fact that the situations really changed on the board during the game.

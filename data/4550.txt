RATING: 8
One of the most fun party games.

RATING: 8
Here's a fun suggestion: see if you can, through the cards you make, slowly turn the game into Magic the Gathering. Or Busen Memo, if you're into that. When I play again, I plan on all the cards I make being Titanic themed.

RATING: 5
This one is hard to rate. It's not really a game (more like a parody of card games), but it's funny with a good crowd.

Players take turns drawing and then playing a card. If you have blank cards, you can just make one up and draw it and play it. It doesn't work as a competitive game, but it's fun if you just try to make up the coolest/goofiest/funniest/weirdest cards or cards that make other people do funny things. When I played, it kind of dragged on after everyone used up their funniest ideas and then someone threw down an "I WIN" card to end the game. I don't think I'd want to play it on a regular basis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is as good as the players make it. Have someone creative? Excellent. Have someone funny? Also excellent. The reverse is true, however. This game can fall REALLY flat if you don't have the right kind of people.

Good if you play with games who understand synergistic effects between cards. Some people take too much time for their artwork, but aside from that, it's good and fun to play. A lot more personal than Fluxx.

Of course I'm going to own a card game that is all about making the cards while you game!  I bought a bunch of index cards, I've cut most of them down to size (just a few left!)  I've even thought of the cards I'm going to create.  Now I just need to gather a group together to play it!  I'm an artist - so I hope that doesn't intimidate my friends into not playing with me (perhaps I can lure some of my friend's children to play - I have a feeling they won't care so much about quality as long as they can make their own cards.)

Our first try went pretty well. We need a few more goes to really understand the game (and stop making game ending cards!) but I think it will become a staple.

This was just fun!  You need the right group of people and it helps if it's later on in the night when people start getting punchy and weird/weirder.  Silly & pointless.  Plenty of opportunities for tit-for-tats and revenge.  We had a few themes develop during/over the course of the game.  I'll definitely play this one again.

Occasionally I like silly games for socializing.  This fits the bill so well.  Reminds me of Bartok (or Gnomic) because of the rules creation.  You have to want the game to be fun though...since you're making up the game as you go there won't be a crutch for you to lean on.  But let me pass on a tip from Dave Barry, the word "weasel" is funny.  So if you're ever feeling dry, just put it on the card.

RATING: 7
A very fun party game with a personal touch... Just how personal depends on you. We have the most fun when we make the cards up about our fellow players.

So impressed with my first game! BGG said it's not for two players, but BGG obviously doesn't know my wife. She's extremely creative, and playing this with her was an absolute blast! 1kBWC is an engine for good times and fun memories - who wins is irrelevant really. Plus you get to keep the wonderful self-created cards as souvenirs (my wife is an artist, so you could just imagine). When I was first reading about this game, I was like WTF, how's that going to work?? But somehow it does! We've developed our own house rules, as I'm sure most people do. I was considering Dvorak too, but am sticking with 1kBWC for the reason that, unlike pretty much any other game out there, it remains an open system. In contrast, Dvorak's impetus, even though it starts wide open, is to move towards a closed system. Can't wait to get my blank white cards on again, ideally with a bottle of wine at the ready.

RATING: 8
This game is a 10 with the right group, but you have to find the right group.  Really creative people, or people really familiar with each other and not afraid to make fun or be made fun of will have a blast.  Less creative people, or people that would rather just be entertained, just won't get into it.

"Dude, those pack of angry bears are stupid."

"Yes you are."
"I'm scoring 100 for my argument bonus."
"I don't think yes/no is enough of an argument to trigger that."
"Yeah it is. 200 points."

The filler game to end all filler games, and you just need to buy some index cards.

RATING: 5
Lots of silly fun with friends!  While there isn't really a game there, I've never laughed so much playing any other game.  It's pretty essential that all players have a somewhat similar sense of humor to have a good time playing 1000 blank white cards.  If not, it can be a real snooze fest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a brilliant game. 

However, it requires that players: 

understand modern exception based card games (in order to make the cards), 

be interested in being creative (in order to make the cards), 

and understand that the goal is not to win the game (because that part is trivial), but to make the coolest cards so that yours are in the half that are used again next time, and not in the half that are tossed in the recycling bin (this part is not trivial), and that the game exists just to showcase how brilliantly creative you are.

Those essentials, plus the effort required to play the game, make a brilliant game really hard to get to the table.

This is a super fun game that caters itself to any group of openminded players.  Non-artists can still apply (therein lies most of the fun), but those who are not creative won't enjoy this one too much.  This game is more of a structured social event than a "game", as its rules are almost transparent.  And the ever-growing deck of cards is a huge plus.  Oh, and this game is essentially free.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) A terrible game but a suitably entertaining social activity. I find the pregame card creation process to be the most amusing part, although there are opportunities for in-game creative brilliance with the blank cards. Not quite engaging enough to hold my interest for numerous repeated plays.

Likes: a lot of oportunity for inside jokes and creativity.  Works with nearly any number over two and under 10. Although it probably could work with more.  Public Domain so it's rather cheap.

Dislikes: Because it requires some creative effort, it can be hard to find some people willing to play.

overall: I really enjoy this game.  It does a great job of bringing out the creativity in yourself as well as others. Definitly one of my favorite party games.

Made a deck in 2006. This game is especially fun when playing several times with the same group of people so the deck evolves and ends up littered with in-jokes.

The "Sharing is Kind" card and the "Boiling Water Kettle of Death" card have entered the everyday vernacular of my group of friends.

My proudest 1KBWC moment: I played a card out of turn, and announced that I was permitted to do so by the Time Travel card, which didn't exist yet. After much discussion, the move was allowed as long as I created and played the Time Travel card later in the game (which I did!).

Basically allows you to be a game designer at the same time as playing a game.

Our "framework" (unbreakable) house rules:
1. Game ends when deck is empty and each player has had one more go.
2. Winner is player with most points at end.
3. Cards cannot:
   - Eliminate players
   - Mention specific players
   - Be rewritten once played
   - Skip more than one of a player's turns
   - Allow a player to pick more than 5 cards from the deck/discard pile
   - Prevent players from writing what they want on blank cards
   - Change the framework rules
   - Make a player do something illegal or nasty.

--

It was fun to get out our old [thing=4550][/thing] house deck. But my first play with it in over two years fell a bit flat. For the second play, with a different group, I tried chucking out our framework rules and encouraging them to come up with their own through trial and error over a series of games - which was much more successful. Reminded me why, with the right group of people, I love this game.

--

We had a huge amount of fun with this game once upon a time, but the house deck is now, I think, permanently retired. Kept as a souvenir of happy times.

Those who say Fluxx is random have obviously never played 1000 Blank White Cards.  I've heard it described as Calvinball with cards.  It is an experience all its own.  Update: New players often ask about cards that say, "I win", or cards worth a million points.  I've started to answer that question with, "If you're playing to win, you're doing it wrong."  But I think it's about more than just playing to have fun.  1KBWC to me is about playing the meta-game.  You're trying to create fun cards and to play cards in interesting ways, and at a certain level, you are trying to win the game, but the meta-game is more important.  There is a scoring phase for the meta-game, the epilogue, but even that isn't necessarily the final arbiter.  It's all very Zen.  It brings to mind when Eddie Valiant asks Roger Rabbit if he could have taken his hand out of the handcuff off at any time, and Roger replies, "No, not at any time, only when it was funny."

When I first read about this game idea, I thought 'This can't possibly work!' but I tried it and it has been a very pleasant surprise! Some of the people who I played with, that certainly would not consider themselves gamers (and hate many 'gamers games') have really enjoyed this one, and though it can be a bit of a 'activity game' a la 'Pictionary' almost, with a little 'gamers guidance' (setting some rules and guidelines and creating some cards with interesting rules) this can certainly grow into a very interesting game with actual strategies, that leaves you very satisfied at the end of every round since all the players are working together to improve and expand the game.

Just played two rounds of this with my family (of 4).  We've played other gnomic games in the past, but this one is my favorite so far — easy to pick up, quick and fun to play.  (But it is important to note that players should not play "to win" — aggressive play can quickly spoil it for everyone.  I know some people who could probably not deal well with this.)

This "game", if you want to call it like that, is probably the most stupid one I have played and ever will. Due to its nature it's broken and, obviously, utterly chaotic, but... It's fun!

The main requirement to enjoy this one is getting the right group, one that enjoys party games. Though drawing is required, drawing skills aren't a must: what is most necessary is having imagination and/or a good sense of humour.

So if you are looking for an extremely silly party game, rejoice! This is for you! Give it a try: cutting out some white paper will not ruin your economy.

Basically Calvinball: the Card Game. This game is fun with a creative group, when you can end up with ridiculous themes and interesting card effects. Watch out when playing with younger children, as you're likely to end up with an overabundance of "lose X turns" cards (as that seems to be the only game mechanic my kids come up with on the fly).

Supposedly the next best thing to Eat Poop You Cat.
We are deck-building now. (November 2015)

Played a few times now; it doesn't live up to the hype. Too much down-time at the beginning of the game while people draw stuff.

My deck is big enough now that I could skip that phase and just add some blank cards into the middle of the pack for people so that they have a better idea of what is going on before they have to draw a new card.

Lets be fair.  This is an obscenely difficult game to rate.  With the right group (and a bit of alcohol) it can be an absolute 10 but with even one person who does not get into the spirit, it can be a 4.  Also, so much depends on the creativity of the participants.  7 seems reasonable.

Is it really fair to say I 'own' this? Doesn't see quite right. (Though I did make a special trip to get five decent pens to play with, along with some cards)

Wholly dependent on the mood of the people playing, this game is fantastic!

Less a game and more a social activity. With the right crowd, this is awesome. Wrong crowd, and it's punishment.

RATING: 5
Puts the random meter so far in the red that it 's almost impossible not to have fun. Technically it's closer to being a pure social activity than it is an actual game -- it's just too weird to take seriously as a game.

I enjoy seeing how everyone approaches the game and the metagame, as well as what they draw (especially if they draw poorly!). Our cards tend to get more and more foul as the game progresses.

Unbelieveably fun.  Cards never seem to get old.  Lots of inside jokes.  Lots of violence and sexuality on them too.  Tap your id and play this game.

I'd say this could go from a 1 to a 10 depending on who you're playing with. Generally it can be fun for a few minutes with the right people and vibe, but really I don't feel any desire to ever play.

RATING: 7
This game has a lot of potential.  The fact that you make your own cards makes for a social game.  The real goal of the game, aside from winning, is to make cards that people want to keep in the deck during the next game.  In this way, a really well done or funny card gains immortality.  Unfortunately, the quality of your group will largely determine the quality of the game.

To me it's really a game of who can be the cleverest.  Nobody cares if you have 1 billion points, it's what you do with the cards and creativity that make the game.  Played at BGG.con (UPDATE: thrice) & was a blast (for awhile) ... completely depends on the group you play with.

Was introduced into it by people at the FLGS.  Had fun playing it the first time but seemed like a light game that would only really be fun if the people playing it had imagination and a good sense of humor when making the cards (most non-gamers lack one or the other).  Probably best with fellow geeks who get the "I lay one card face-down...HAHA you've activated my TRAP CARD OF DOOM!" type jokes.

RATING: 7
To be clear, this is not so much a game one owns as it is a game one makes up as it is played. I use it in my creative writing class at the beginning of the year as an exercise in adaptive creativity and playfulness to illustrate how silly and outside-the-box thinking creates situations that are interesting, and funny as hell. It transfers directly to writing when I anecdotally explain that Douglas Adams came up with the Infinite Improbability drive by essentially writing himself into a corner, and indeed the pleasure of reading his writing is the bizarre and unexpected twists, turns, and general silliness this adaptive creativity has.

Don't sic this on non-gamers. We got too many weird "I don't get it" looks, and the game never quite took off. Too many people also makes the game drag. It's probably best with a handful of gamers looking for a filler.

I don't know if I've laughed harder playing any other game than 1kbwc (except maybe rpg's).  The only downer is trying to get people who think they're bad at drawing to play.  Give those types a swift kick in the backside and tell them to get over themselves.

This rating requires explanation - 1kBWC is great to play with friends as a social activity.  But it's not something you'd want to play more than a couple times a year.  When you're playing with the right crowd, it's a 9 or 10.

As most people have said, it's not really a game, but that can be said about several entries in BGG. I'm still going to rate it as a game though. It's fun with the right people, like everyone else has said. Basically, it's something fun to do, as long as you are someone who enjoys just having fun and being silly with other people. If not, I suggest you play an actual game.

RATING: 6
Great party game for very creative people.  This rating is a "6" because unless you have the right group in the right mood, this game is not worth the effort at all, and rates a "2".  At the right place and right time, this game gets a "9" or even "10".

Holy Crap!  This had me laughing so hard that I couldn't breathe.  Don't look at this as a game, but rather an activity and you'll have a blast.

Mark Taraba actually peed himself while playing this.  It was disgusting.  We excused him for doing it, cause we were laughing so hard.  I don't know what his excuse was in a later game of Hamsterrolle.

I was a bit surprised when Ray Peterson slapped Mike Penisi across the face, then astounded when he continued across the table and got Chris Aniballi and Stuart Moore straight in the kisser.  I figure he had some weird card, but then he kicked Tom Wham in the ass, tore off his shirt and ran down the hall spraying himself with Mr. Pibb.  I guess I'll never know what was on the card.

UPDATE: Don't play without Nessie's Vagina otherwise the game is totally imbalanced.

This is an outlier for me. I love 1KBWC, precisely because it does not to to be anything it isn't. It's not a game about winning, it's a game about being silly and having fun with your friends. It's about what you can all come up with together.

If I rated this game as though it were any other board game, it'd fare poorly. But I can't do that. 1KBWC is a joyous game for me and I have so many fond memories of it.

RATING: 8
This one is best played with friends. Inside jokes and stories go a long way. There isn't any strategy but the fun is left up to the group. I find it's most fun if you keep a seeder deck and get rid of the crap cards at the end of a play session. It takes a bit too long to play without the seeder. Also, it is a bit more fun if the deck is directed into a Dvorak style game.

This game takes about 30 seconds to learn and is great fun for everyone, especially the artsy types.

As a house rule we ask everyone to bring 5 pre-made cards to each game night to help build up a good deck and to keep introducing new cards. We find this gives everyone (especially the non-artsy types) more time to be creative.

RATING: 7
Wasn't expecting to like this at all, then I ended up being bummed when it was over and thinking about it for the rest of the night.

Some people have said that if you play this game to win, then you don't get the point. I understand where they're coming from -- still, the playtester in me kept trying to think of ways to "game" the system and possibly even break it. In a weird way, that's a testament to how much I enjoyed it. By breaking it, I could maybe try to fix it and make it stronger. It's certainly got me thinking.

At any rate, if you play 1000 Blank White Cards with a group of people who are genuinely creative and goofy (and who, unlike me, won't try to think of ways to break it) then this is a wild, hugely entertaining ride. I want to start building my own deck now!

It's an exercise in drawing goofy cards and hoping your points stay on the table until the end of the game (which is pretty rare considering the kind of sociopaths I game with).

Pros: Cheap

Fun

Cons: Unstructured

Conclusion:  1000 Blank White Cards is a great game for a large group of people that have nothing better to do with their time.  Personally I would rather play a regular board game.  It can be both fun and creative for those involved.

RATING: 8
Great game when played with the right group of people. The more players the better. My group has always played with a a deck containing a certain number of cards based on the number of players (say, 8 cards per player with 3 cards per player being blank) with the blank cards mixed in. We've had nights where some players over multiple games create "expansion sets" where all the cards they draw during the game have a theme, like Froggy Went a-Courtin', The Yoopers, or Dingoes that Ate My Babies. However, if played with groups of uncreative people who are unwilling to be vengeful or vindictive, this game can become a bore.

One Thousand Blank White Cards is a game played with a stack of index cards, a bunch of pens, and any other props on hand (such as Ubongo gems, Maus Nach Haus mice, or this strange little creature: http://www.funagain.com/control/product/~product_id=019276/). Players simply write and/or draw whatever they’d like on the index cards, create a deck of homemade cards, draw a hand of cards, and take turns playing them on each other. The rest is up to the players' imagination, for better or worse...

A thousand sheets of blank white paper does not make a novel though by one definition it is a book.  Much like I feel Fluxx is an excersize in futility, this one is similar but requires you to generate your own chaos rather than having it given to you in a box of pre-printed garbage.  As such, I give it a one-point higher rating than Fluxx for personal creativity.  For social interaction there are far better party games out there.

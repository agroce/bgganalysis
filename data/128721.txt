If you like economic engine building games then Crisis is worth a look.  It's a worker placement game with many options for placing four (maybe later five) workers.  The core of it is buying businesses (farms, factories, resorts and more), hiring staff to make them more productive and buying and selling resources.  

What makes Crisis different is that all of this takes place against the background of a tanking economy.  The worse the economy, the worse the random events that afflict the players.  Beyond that there is an escalating victory point target which penalises players for failing to meet it by pushing the economy further towards a game ending crash.  This generates some nice tension, though it does give the player who's not having a good time the possibility of terminating the game early.  And as with so many economic games, if you start poorly you only have two hours of losing to look forward to.  

My second reservation is that turn order seems critical, to the extent that in a four or five player game the last player must prioritise a worker placement changing turn order over almost anything else.   

Production quality is fine and the artwork is good.  The board is busy but clearly laid out.

Okay worker placement. Did not like the way the turns grew exponentially by the end of the game - by the last turn, my turn took forever with all the various conversions and such I needed to do. Nothing special here, but I will add I didn't particularly enjoy the art/graphic design.

I did enjoy actually playing this game...but.
In the grand pile of worker placement games this one has some unfortunate shortcomings.

➡There is no variation in placement slots for different player counts.
➡The influence cards in the game are very swingy, especially for a euro. I played with a house rule, where 3 cards are flipped each round and players can choose from the selection. 
➡The unique selling point - the changeable economy did not have a noticeable impact on game play.  
➡The board art is messy, I thought that the art looked nice when I kickstarted the game but it is unnecessary untidy. There is a lot of repeat symbology on the board.
➡There are lots of moving parts, the game takes alot of fiddling to set up.

I did like the way that the companies produce the goods, I think that the game could have been streamlined by not requiring workers and just using resources to fuel production. Perhaps companies could produce resources for a market inside the game for other players.

RATING: 7
Average worker placement game that could have needed some more polish. The luck of the draw of cards and workers seems to have a huge impact, and the art is very dark (difficult to decipher).

Interesting game that I wish I could have designed.  I love the idea of a mutual failure and trying to "help" each other so everyone doesn't fail.  We played 3P on medium difficulty and quickly pegged the prosperity at the top.  Unsure if we played a rule wrong, or if one player just killed it (the other two were roughly on par with austerity each round).

My rating is fairly low but based on only 1 play through. I found the game to be rather clunky and I did not enjoy the design. I didn't like the art of the main board and it was taught poorly. Perhaps this games deserves another chance but I'm not clamoring for another play.

First Play: A nice clear rule book but needs concentration to pick up all the details. The game is brutal and you will need to find players who take back stabbing with resignation. Those who play nice and bear a grudge will not like this.

I liked it a lot.

RATING: 7
My initial impressions of this game were not great as we played on Easy which practically negated the tension from the crisis track. Then I played it a second time on Hard and we crashed the economy halfway through the game despite our best efforts. Medium is probably best but my opinion improved after the second, harder play. In the end, this game is your fairly typical get-resources-and-convert-them-into-better-resources worker placement game. However, it layers on the crisis mechanics which not only will affect certain things in-game but also can just end the game prematurely. Depending on how people are trying to build their point/resource engines, it may be advantageous for you if the game ends early. There's a fairly good amount of luck in this game with how buildings, workers, events and personal bonus cards are drawn. If people get some lucky draws early, it can really kickstart their engine and make it hard to catch up. In the end, this is an enjoyable game. The art is cartoony which strangely compliments the dire theme. The components are also quality including custom wooden pieces for all the resources. That's Kickstarter for ya. Not a game I would ask to play but would say yes to if asked.

RATING: 7
Interesting game for sure.  The engine building / worker placement doesn't really have anything new, but the event deck and semi - coop elements are interesting.   Was probably expecting it to be a little "heavier" than it was, but I think it definitely had enough going on to be very interesting.  Will see where I end up on this one after more plays, but so far found it fun for sure.

RATING: 7
This is a fun and interesting take on the worker placement genre with an interesting cooperative twist and the Caylus-style "place all of your workers first and then activate them". I enjoyed the competition for actions in our 4 player game, but some of the players felt that turn order was far too important (I went first so I wasn't complaining). The game has a tight economy and a unique "VP target" to reach each round. One complaint I have is that there can be fairly significant luck of the draw (in export tiles, businesses to invest in, and workers) that could play into certain players strategies at the right times. It might be nice to have a preview of the upcoming workers like you do for the market tiles, to help players plan a bit further ahead. Lastly, I found the card art to be uninteresting (a missed opportunity for beautiful art) and the overall board art to be too dark. On the flip side, the goods tokens (in the KS deluxe version at least) were very nice. Overall it was quite fun and something I would like to play more, but I do have some concerns that there may be a few rough edges in the design. Our general impression after a 4 player game was that maybe  3 players would be the sweet spot, but only time will tell.

Solidly designed worker placement resource conversion game. The economic engine comes from chaining production input/output from different companies. These mechanics appear in many other games, but the twist comes from having a shared economic target. If the total perfomance of the players drops below a certain point, the game ends immediately and a different victory condition is applied.

The game lasts a fixed number of turns and there is a fixed set of companies to invest in. Each phase has its own set of companies which balances the options players get. 

The setting is a country in the future that is in dire straits. It has a cartoony industrial scifi design and is illustrated very cleanly. I think it's beautifully done, but some people may find it's too dark. Well, it's made by Greek designers who clearly modelled the game after the situation their own country is in. I guess that calls for a dark theme.

Pros:
+ Clear rules and a game board that reads as a players guide.
+ Nice art, oversized cards, beautiful wooden components.
+ Works thematically.

+/- There's not much of a catch up mechanism. If you made a mistake, or you missed an opportunity through timing it can hamper you severely.

Cons:
- The randomness in bonus cards. This could be mitigated by using house rules.
- The economic aspect is pretty flat.
- Replayability. You need a few games to get good in optimizing this game, but by that time you've probably explored all the options already and it begins to feel stale.

All in all a good game that I liked to have had some more beef to it. It's not been as challenging as I thought.

I've manged to bring this to table twice to date. Based on the forum thread about 5 player being especially nasty, I was apprehensive going into the first session. Everyone had a great time and seemed to be enjoying the tightness of the board. One player was behind when we had to clean up about turn 5. However they would have finally gotten a chance to sell their warehouse full of chemicals which may have caught them up. The second game involved three players. Limited resources still felt limited and the lower austerity goal was tough to meet and we tanked the economy. I think my aggressive headhunting of employees coupled with a banking strategy that made money but no real economic growth contributed to destroying the economy. oops.

RATING: 8
This is a game inspired by the true story of the Greek economic meltdown of 2010+, which is a fascinating idea right there. It’s a worker placement game whereby some actions (such as exporting) help the economy (you get VPs) and some actions (such as importing) hurt the economy (cost you VPs). The hook here is that there’s a VP target for each round. Depending on how all the players are doing relative to that VP target, the economy will improve or degrade. The economic status has two ramifications. First, there are green/yellow/red events and second, if it degrades below 0 the game ends immediately and everyone might lose. 

The thrust of the game is acquiring companies that require certain employee types (hammer, shovel, etc.) to power them. Your employees boost production and come in +1 to +3 variety. For example, a +2 shovel and a +1 hammer on your farm now have you cranking out an extra three food a turn. That food can power another of your companies or be sold on the export market for VPs and/or money. But you have to be there early because the export market only wants so much of any one item. 

One of the more salient aspects of the game is that production cannot be daisy chained across your companies. That is, you can’t use the output of one company as an input to power another company on the same turn. This means you need to really plan out how much you’re going to hold back for next turn vs sell now to accommodate your immediate needs. Each turn you can acquire new and better companies and move your workforce around as you see fit. Bonus cards give you boosts along the way. 

On paper this all sounds old hat, but it comes together in a unique way. The fun of the game is really in the flexibility it gives you. You can start out being a farmer and an industrialist and jump then into the resort and power plant game. Or start by producing energy and slide into making chemicals and steel. How efficiently you do this and how well you time it with the needs of the export market will determine your success. You absolutely will outgrow your earlier companies and will shutter less effective ones in favor of new ones you’ve acquired while (hopefully) maximizing the employee types you’ve hired. The w-p is resolved in Caylus style linear order, and interaction comes in the form of grabbing the employees and resources you need from the limited spots as well as getting to the export market before others. 

All in all, I like the efficiency puzzle this game offers and have enjoyed 1P, 2P, 3P, and 4P. It's been well received by all my friends. My concerns about the game are that one, the aspect of tanking the economy and forcing the game to end early does not seem like a real threat. We all are cranking VPs by mid-game such that the economy is never at a threat to crash. I thought that would be a prominent aspect to the game. 

And two, the companies that don’t produce things that need to get sold at the export market but produce VPs themselves (resorts, food industry, etc.) are strictly superior. These companies produce VPs passively and save you the trouble of having to get to the export market to sell stuff before your opponents beat you to it. Everyone needs to fight over these and make sure no one person ends up with too many or else they’ll have extra actions to fish the bonus card deck while they’re cranking 20+ VPs a turn.

Juego económico basado en colocación de trabajadores.

Cada jugador va realizando acciones que buscan construir edificios que producen bienes y que cada turno intentará vender o bien cumpliendo unos contratos disponibles y finitos para todos los jugadores a cambio de puntos y dinero o los venderá al mercado negro a cambio de dinero.

Para activar los edificios los jugadores deberán contratar trabajadores de determinados tipos. Dentro de un mismo tipo los trabajadores aportan diferente producción.

En función de cómo lo están haciendo los jugadores al principio del turno habrá un evento que afectará a todo el mundo. 

Además existen unas cartas que modifican las condiciones del juego para el jugador que la juega

Como cosa curiosa, la partida puede finalizar sin ganador si los jugadores no consiguen ir cumpliendo el objetivo de cada ronda

Underneath this whole 'fighting the crisis/cooperating/meeting the set economic goals' conglomerate of theme&hype lies a fairly simple and straightforward economic game.
You build factories, employ workers, get goods to run the factories, produce and fulfill orders with produced goods.  One or two other activities and that's it - the whole game.

I was surprised by the simplicity of the design and while it's perfectly fine economic game I wasn't thrilled or overly excited during the gameplay so it won't be enetring my collection (I'm much more interested in Anachrony, made in similar vein, but much more complex and innovative).

I enjoyed my second game. But the game does have some flaws. If you stall your engine you really spend a lot of managers getting it going again as you cannot feed resources until the next round.

The influence cards are far too random and some are better than others.
On the last round I got a take a free loan action... I had so much money there was not much point.

The art is printed a little too dark, and makes it a little less appealing on the shelf.

Great game - good worker placement mechanics on a tight board with a tight economy. The way buildings and workers interact to produce goods is awesome, and the way they work with the market is great. 

The export market is somewhat unreliable and random, and can cause someone to lose through no fault of their own. Also, the event cards are mainly annoying, and not really needed in such a design. However, these are small issues, and overall the game is great.

Moving it from 6->7 at the moment. Medium and Hard levels are more challenging and interesting. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Played one four player game at the easy level. Don't - move right to the medium or hard level as easy is a joke with four. My game was marred by a person or two experiencing severe AP (although I don't think either were paralyzed, I think both were seriously going through all the different permutations possible. Couple that horrendous down time with a really poor decision in the first round of the game from which I never really recovered, it wasn't overly positive for me. However, there's enough going on that I am really curious to try again. I do wonder if first round power plants are really viable.

Thoughts after 3 plays, 1 on easy and 2 on medium level (all 5 players).
It is a really good and interesting semi-coop worker placement economic game. 
The idea with a response in the game in ralation to how the gamers in total manage to reach the VP-goals each term is fascinating and novel to me. 
In one of the medium sessions the game ended abruptly by the coutry going into bankruptcy. I had expected this to feel a bit disapointing, but it did not cause we did see it comming, even tho not as quick as it did. 
Still it does not feel much like coop, rather one more crusial thing in the game to keep track on when to decide if you are going for points or Money in the end of a round. 

Totally enjoyable.. will be played alot.

A well-designed, economic & worker-placement game, with an interesting twist (the possibility of ending the game prematurely due to bankruptcy of the country). 
There are several viable paths to victory (producing and exporting vs. running direct VP buildings) and difficult choices to be made. Reasonable interaction and nice integration of the theme. Some randomness due to the event cards and the special cards, but it is tolerable. 
Might go up to 9 with more plays.

The core of the game is fun and works well. The fact there is a round-by-round increasing target keeps you on your toes and prevents hoarding stuff for a big move at the end. But the premature ending we had in our second game was really underwhelming. I'm also worried that some investment paths are simply stronger than others, and turn order plays too big a role in this.
Would like to explore further, but more likely to become a 6 than an 8.

Great mechanics, fantastic flow with excellent -just in the taste- player interaction.. 

Different investment options provide a different game play each time with quite diversified paths to victory..

Excellent game overall..

Edit (after 6-7 more plays):

There are some flaws especially in the higher number of players, first player position and the workers are getting way too important..

The buildings start to feel the same after a few plays, definitely need an expansion to increase the types and variety..

VP production by buildings and having at least 2 of them seems to be way too strong.. Noone emphasizing production won the game in our plays.. Warehouse size, as well as contracts limit VP earnings from production companies, whereas VP production from Resorts etc are much easier and stable..

Good, fun worker placement game, which we like to put on the table at least once a month now, but lowered my rating by 1.

good game, but felt too mechanical and random to me. You cannot really plan ahead, since you don't know what resources you need for the plants that will be available next round. Fighting the crisis score-track in a semi-coop way is thematic maybe justified, but doesn't add much to the gameplay for me. Going through the actions one by one felt very mechanical.

A game I was considering on picking up at Essen and decided on passing. I was really excited when my friend James said he would bring and teach it. I honestly didn't know what to expect but it is a worker placement game where you place and then in order of spaces do the actions people selected. You are aiming to get investments and produce the materials to sell off for points. There is a group element to this where you are trying to beat the economy and if people aren't doing well then the economy will tank. It is still every man for himself by the end though. It is a challenging balance and a game I would try again, even after a pretty terrible first play. There is no coming back from failure in the early rounds. No catch up mechanic and it was painful to play the whole game knowing you are going to lose.

Great time playing on medium. Came from behind by tapping resorts and lost by 2 points in the end. Played with all experienced gamers. The city deterioration never really played a factor. Even without that playing a big impact, there was still enough cutthroat placement and screwage to make the game very enjoyable.

RATING: 8
Crisis is an extremely tight worker placement game where everyone places their meeples, and then you resolve the board in number order. The general idea of the game is the city is in a financial crisis, and an outside government has placed austerity measures. What this works out to in game terms is that players have an ever-increasing victory point goal they have to try and meet each round. At the end of the round, you tally who was above and who was below the goal, and adjust the city's well-being marker up or down. 

Aside from other players always taking the worker spots you absolutely needed, the tricky part of this is players are trying to create resource production chains and hire workers, and investing in your engine tends to eat your score in the short term to pay off in the long term. If too many players make deep investments like this in the same round(s), the game might prematurely end if the city well-being craters below 0. In this case, the money the players had been working toward getting is valueless, and only players who made the VP check threshold are eligible to win. This does have the potential to make the game end anticlimactically in the first few turns, but it also adds some tension.

The engine building element is very compelling. You need to buy factory cards that synergize with each other, and also have the workers to run them. Different workers of types matching the icons on the factory can slot in to increase the factory's output. You also can't chain resources generated in the same turn, so keeping some cushion of goods on-hand in the hopes of getting future factories and then having what to run them on that same turn can be crucial, which isn't obvious on a first play of the game.

There is a deck of action cards that have different degrees of usefulness, especially at different times in the game. One particular card forces everyone to not use one of their employee tiles, which later in the game you barely care, and early in the game is completely devastating. The card luck was a stumbling block for my group.

Overall I really enjoy this game with either 3 or 4 players. It's got a few issues here or there but turns are fast, there's plenty of nice tension about what you'll be able to accomplish on a given round, and the production chain aspect is very satisfying.

I've enjoyed this game with multiple player counts.  My initial apprehensions revolved around the game ending early due to the instability in the economy.  I've found that this not only hasn't been a problem, but I think it's actually helped make games that aren't going so well end sooner.  I really like that!

There is a touch of iconography to get your head around, but at it's core, it's pretty straight forward.  Worker placement (like Dominant Species), engine building (like Imperial Settlers) then completing contracts (like Lords of Waterdeep).

Oh, and the production is beautiful.  The components and artwork are so nice.  It's a little on the dark side, but I think it looks so, so cool.

Very enjoyable worker placement/resource management game.  There's nothing revolutionary in the game.   You get workers, you buy buildings, you produce goods and sell them for points and money.  None-the-less, the game is very fun to play.  All the worker spots are well balanced and you really need to plan well.  Knowing the buildings ahead of time does help.  Also 5 money to 1 point seems high for end game conversion.  It makes getting points during the game bit less meaningful.

Crisis is an interesting economic simulation. If the players fail to keep the economy afloat, the game will crash and end prematurely. Much of the game is about production chains, and you need to keep in mind that you need to have the inputs you need on hand before the production step starts. I enjoyed the game, but games with these styles of production chains usually don't excite me enough to seek them out.

Beautiful board and components and the semi-cooperative aspect of keeping your head above water manages to capture some of the "penalty" feel of a Rosenberg game without making those behind feel as hopeless.  All that said, it's a game basically about generating resources and converting those resources to other resources, which you've seen a million times before.

This was a big impulse buy.  At the time I was buying up anything that looked interesting on Kickstarter and I bought it knowing almost nothing about the game or the designers.

I really enjoyed this game though, it is a worker placement game where players each try to develop the most successful corporation, mostly through investing in production facilities which generate points or create products that can be sold for points.  The hitch that makes this more than any other worker placement game is that the state of the economy is evaluated at the end of each round and the worse the economy is the worse the events that happen to everyone each round are.  And if the economy gets too bad the game ends early.

What I like about this game more than other games with similar mechanics (where the game is competitive but each player is responsible for some sort of cooperative feature of the game) is that someone losing this game can't just crash the game by ruining the economy and having everyone lose.  Because when the game ends early if a player has met the requirements for that round, they are still scored for a chance to win.

The game is reasonably simple, there are a lot of action spaces and a decent amount of mechanics and interactions but they are reasonably intuitive and everything flows really, really well.  The art is high quality, I wouldn't give it any awards but everything looks pretty and professionally made (can't say that about every Kickstarter) and I like the quality of life features of the game.  There are 3 difficulty settings and even two sides of the board that either show the mechanics more clearly or the art more clearly if you are familiar with the spaces and just want a nicer looking play surface.

We actually played our first game on easy because I had it in my head that this game was meant to be really difficult, not sure where I got that from.  On easy it was WAY too easy.  We finished the game with the economic status in the green and maxed out almost every round.  I might even jump right to the hardest difficulty in my next play.

Just found this one on Kickstarter. Dieselpunk and worker placement sounds right up my alley, but the economy theme is not. I'll keep this on the radar, and see what reviews and stuff says. Will probably not back, unless something really swings me, but might consider picking up in retail, if it gets good reviews from the right people.

EDIT: Well, as everyone knows, this became a limited print run, and there are no more copies… I guess we'll see where it goes. Unless there's another print run, I expect this to hold a pretty high second hand price for a fair bit of time, so I'll probably not buy it unless they get a distributor and it hits retail.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Decently straight-forward economic progression engine building game. The different workers powering up buildings is fun and neat. However, the game is pretty dry overall. There doesn't seem to be much flair or super interesting decisions going on. Plus, it can be extremely brutal and AP prone if you want it to be. Taking a -1 VP hit to deny someone's action (since you might not be able to do the action) but costing them tons more leads to a lot of attacking potentiality if you spend time looking at what everyone is doing.

Also, the balance on the "difficulties" seems weird. Easy is insanely easy, medium is still pretty easy, and hard is very challenging and nearly impossible. Seems like "medium" should be the "easy" and there should be a difficulty between "medium" and "hard" or something. Plus, the changing economy doesn't do much outside of an Event card and changing the cost of some workers. Overall seems like a tacked on thing that could have just been removed or at least better integrated.

Finally, there are a few balance issues I've found. On the last turn some things come to the future markets, but unless you get a special card to buy from them then you can be screwed simply due to randomness. Same for some events that could give the game to someone else simply due to luck.

I'd play it again to see how it holds up over multiple games, but it wasn't anything special in my eyes.

First play impression: Really neat game. Worker placement is the main mechanism but it feels more like a medium-weight economic game. You've got to get resources, find ways to turn them into the resources you need the most, then decide whether to turn those resources into points or money. Money is incredibly important but of course you needs points to win (and to even keep the game going).

As someone who isn't usually a fan of economic games, the worker placement really helped to make it palatable. You've got about 14 different placement areas, but they're all easy to understand and several of them are different versions of the same thing. After the initial explanation my group had very few rules questions and the game moved along quickly.

The game flow is nice and smooth. Everybody places all of their workers, then you activate all of the spots in order (just like in Caylus, Dominant Species, etc) then you do some production and a tiny amount of end-of-round stuff. Turns are fast, rounds are fast. 

I do have some concerns about the amount of randomness. For such a tight economic game, there are a couple of random elements that could really hit a player hard, or possibly randomly reward other players. One is the "intrigue" deck. I don't remember what the game term is, but it's a deck of event cards the players can acquire to give them a bonus. Some will give a couple of free points, some will give free money, and some can block your opponents' production which can deny them a huge amount of points. The cards need some balancing. I'm also not sure how balanced the various buildings are, but I didn't notice any issues during my game.

The other element is the employee tiles. There's a stack of these and you randomly put out a few that are available each round. You need specific types of employees to activate your buildings, but sometimes the one you need just doesn't come out during a round. This didn't seem to be as big of a problem after a couple of rounds (because players will usually have a couple of employees to work with by then) but early on you could possibly fall behind if you don't have access to the right employees.

This is minor, but the board could also be improved. It's really dark overall and I would just like it to be brighter. The layout could also be nicer, but it's perfectly functional as is.

Overall I like the game. I will definitely play again, but I don't see getting a copy myself because of the random elements. Most Kickstarter games are just beta versions until the company releases a 2.0 version, so I'm hoping they do the same thing here and address some of the random elements.

Rating of 8 only with 2-3 players as it doesn't scale too well with more. I love the semi-coop nature to it. More often than not in my games we haven't collaborated enough in the early rounds so the already poor market conditions hit rock bottom before we could get our engines up and running. This idea of the game ending faster than the seven rounds it's set to take is a cool idea. Everybody loses if you haven't gotten the economy back into shape (unless you're higher up the point track than is required). The VP requirements for every round get higher and higher so if you fall too far behind the equation can quickly become impossible for you to solve.

Economic worker placement.  The theme of this game surprises me.  It clearly represents a once great city that has been ruined and in near economic collapse from generations of over reaching bureaucracy, political abuse, a runaway socialism over regulating private industry and controlling citizens lives through social influence.  In the wake of the wreckage, we George Soros types swoop in to take advantage of these fire sale investment opportunities caused by these unchecked power mongers.  I do like how the contract tiles represent the demand market. And I do like how the game adjusts the events, resource and foreign and domestic labor markets depending on the level of instability.  Later rounds lead to some pretty heavy upkeep and bookkeeping. But I play board games to escape and have fun.  This hits too close to home for many situations in Europe with the United States following closely behind.  Casting it as a sci fi future city helps a little. I do like its lesson.

Semi-co-operative Caylus style worker placement engine-building game where players are trying to save a crumbling "city economy" but at the same build their engine.   Its a good game, although I really didn't like the whole random chance card you get every round.  Further, its hard to get back into the game if you fall behind or for some reason get stuck in a loop of trying to make money to buy things but need the things to get the money.    If one or two people attempt to do everything they can to build their engine fast, the hit on the team can be enough to cause the game to end.   I think its an alright game, willing to play it again.  I would like it more if it didn't have random events/chance cards all the time.

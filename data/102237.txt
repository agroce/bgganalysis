RATING: 5
For an asymmetric game where one player controls three different dwarves and the other a dragon, it's surprisingly shallow and repetitive. Dwarf: play an attack card. Dragon: Decide whether to defend.

my rating is raising...this game is really good!I thought it is impossible to win with dwarves, instead it is not true! If both players play well, the game is tense and with difficult choices to make. One of the best surprise of 2012 (bought at Play 2012, Modena, Italy).

RATING: 5
Despite the rating, this was a very fun and intense game. The asymmetrical play really forces players to adapt and eliminates "player mimicing" common to symmetrical games when newbies play. In my group, we hit the ground running hard. I've read many stories of groups that just can't get the strategy down. In ours, the skill ceiling was reached immediately. The Dragon does actually have a slight advantage over all. I could see 1/5 games going to dwarves if both play optimally. Hence why this couldn't be rated higher. Great game to break out to newer people in board gaming as they likely won't solve it so quickly.

RATING: 5
Older players may find Drako reminiscent of the Ali-Frasier fights - that's if they can visualise Smokin' Joe as three dwarves and Ali as a dragon.  The dragon stings like a bee, but has to spend most of the game floating like a butterfly, while the dwarves must attack relentlessly, soaking up hits.  Once you have learned these strategies, you're about done with Drako.  The game is too constrained by the lack of variation in its protagonists and the cards that drive them.

Production quality and artwork are both good, the rules are clearly written.

I try different games with my 6yr old all the time, trying to find that 1 'adolescent grail' that will stick and make him come back for more.  Only 1 play, but I think this may be "it".

Drako is a fast and light-hearted game whose main (and likely only) feature consists in coming up with two unbalanced factions: provided you don’t expect too much from it, it might work as a quick filler with modest replayability. (October 2011)

Nice card driven filler.

Don´t believe for a second that Drako takes just around fifteen minutes to play... Yes, one game is really that quick, but it will NEVER stay just with one duel. It´s so addictive, that you´ll find out yourself trap between revenges, confirmation of victory, playing for the other side etc. Both sides plays absolutly differently and game is also transportable, with rules which can be explained in five minutes. So ideal game to the pub.

A great, thematic asymmetrical game. Really it's like an abstract game in some ways but they did a great job with the theme. It is really easy to teach, it plays fast, and players seem to catch on quickly. Players I've introduced it too have requested further games. The components are both attractive and effective. They're easy to differentiate and help to draw players into the theme. Game endings seem to be close, but sometimes feel as if they are partially determined by the way the decks were dealt. Replayability might be the only concern, but so far I'm still getting a kick out of it.

Entretenido filler para dos jugadores: a pesar de tener bastante azar, requiere conocer los puntos fuertes de cada bando y saber jugar las cartas de la manera adecuada. Partidas muy cortas e intensas, y resulta fácil de aprender. 

Como contrapartida, se podría decir que aunque parezca que hay muchas estrategias posibles, realmente solo hay un puñado de combinaciones verdaderamente efectivas... por lo tanto, si lo juegas muchas veces seguidas corres el riesgo de que esto acabe resultándote muy obvio, y te empiece a parecer bastante repetitivo. Aconsejaría no jugar más de 2 partidas seguidas, y no todas las semanas (vamos, que si abusas de él lo puedes quemar muy rápido).

RATING: 2
Played once on yucata and was very underwhlemed.
The game appears to be very scripted and very unbalanced.

The dragon has essentially no chance of ever killing a dwarf, because of the myriad of defensive cards available to them.
The dwarves must kill the dragon before their deck runs out to win.

The games strategy boils down to the dragon player running away the entire game, hoping to survive until the dwarf deck is depleted, while the dwarves chase him and constantly attack.

This is not an epic battle between a dragon and a group of dwarves, but a boring cat & mouse game, which the cat (dwarves) will win most the time.

For some reason, this is the first time ever that the theme and mechanics of a game bother me. It just feels too much like cornering down an animal, getting him weaker and then killing him just because. Yes, I get it, it's a dragon and all, but that's what it feels to me anyway. Won't ever play it again.

[b]Rating based on - 10+ plays, 2 player[/b]
A 2 player asymmetric game where one player is a dragon trying to escape a trap set by three dwarves, and the other controls the three dwarves who each have a unique ability. The dwarves win by killing the dragon, and the dragon wins either by killing off all the dwarves or surviving until the dwarves run out of cards thereby escaping the trap. I learned and played online at Yucata.de. The rules were simple to learn but the tactics and positioning took some getting used to. There is some skill in hand management, but on the whole you need to be lucky with card draws and have the right cards available at the right time. It's no good having a handful of defense cards when you're not being attacked, and it's detrimental when you [i]are[/i] being attacked and can't defend yourself either because you've had to toss your cards away or because you just haven't got them yet.

Overall this can be a fun and exciting game when played against the right opponents. There's some fire breathing here, a slash of the axe there, a couple of quick bites, the launch of a net and the subsequent escape etc. which makes the back and forth really fun. Increasingly though, it seems that the dominant strategy for the dragon is turtling (stand in one spot out of crossbow range discarding cards until the dwarves move to him, then fly to another spot and stand there discarding cards until the dwarves move to him, then rinse and repeat until the dwarves run out of cards) which is probably really smart play and I guess wins those players a lot of games, but makes it INcredibly boring to play against them. The game doesn't punish turtling which is kind of odd given the fun cards the dragon has. Seems like a flaw in the game design as I can't imagine you were just supposed to discard them willy nilly but rather if you couldn't use them...As a person who likes to be really active in my games I find this style of play deathly dull.

I've been chasing after a copy of this game for a couple of years now as I had some very fun first experiences. Having played again recently after having been away from it for some time that desire has now been squashed. While I wouldn't be opposed to the occasional online game against a player who's really into the spirit of the game, for my physical collection it will be hands down 7 Ronin and Summoner Wars.

Nagyon jó kétszemélyes játék. Hangulatos és érdekes módon mindig nagyon kiegyenlített. Az nem annyira tetszett, hogy úgy éreztem, hogy a sárkánynak nincs sok esélye megölni a törpéket. Ezen felül az újrajátszhatósággal kapcsolatban vannak kétségeim, tekintve, hogy minden játék gyakorlatilag ugyanaz.

RATING: 4
Suppose you have a game with asymmetrical teams which fight each other. Due to different abilities and card decks (and slightly different victory conditions), each faction needs to tackle the problem differently. Sounds like a great start? So did I.

Now imagine the abilities and cards you get for your faction pretty much dictate the approach you need to take for you. The dragon isn't very good defensively so it needs to evade. The dwarves need to end the game before their cards run out so they obviously need to attack. Now you might say "But that's just the overall battle plan. You still need to come up with the tactics to execute that plan." Well, true. But then the cards tell you what you can do on any given turn, and rarely do you have a choice between two equally good moves.

In his desire to create a truly asymmetric game it seems the author went a bit overboard and created a scripted battle scene instead.

RATING: 7
Pretty light asymmetric game. You need to know when to strike and when to be wounded. 

Being wounded is part of the game so you need to keep wounds slow paced as the game progresses. As the Dragon, a movement and fly card are maybe better than an attack card. Dwarves are tough as leather biscuits, stay away and pester from afar. 

For the Dwarves, close in, keep non-aligned to avoid fire, prepare to sacrifice the net dude so use all the nets you can. 

There are many trade-offs in this game, to be played tactically and with an eye on what is lost overall as you seize the advantages of the moment.

After 1 prototype play.

The game is very generic. It's perfect as a base for expanding the rules or creating a myriad of expansions, but it will lose its lightness and filler character then. And that's the problem...
Designer has to make a tough choice - leave it as it is (NOT a gamer's game -> too generic, simple and uninteresting for the geek) or change the target of the game towards the experienced gamers and expand it...

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2014)

Love the theme. This is a (relatively) easy tactical game. Still I currently enjoy it a lot. It plays fast, the rules are easy to teach and the minis are great. Both teams play in different ways (asymmetrical) and it has some interesting decisions and tension. I thought the Dragon had the advantage, but in my games (so far) the dwarves have won more often than not.

For now, Drako is a borderline 7.0, perhaps its rating will go down with more plays.

After a lot more plays, I continue to like this game. I It is now a solid 7.0 for me due to its playing time. When both players know the rules, the game can be played under 15 minutes, so the “luck of the draw” doesn’t bothers me and we can play the game again.

After even more plays I’m tired of the game. My desire to play it is rather low now, so I’m downgrading its rating in consequence. I already sold my copy and I won’t be sad if I never play the game again. On the other hand I think that I would play if requested, but Drako is no longer a game I will actively seek.

Drako is no longer among my favorite games of 2011.

Quite a nice 2 player game with a lot of twists during the gameplay. May seem a bit boring and too random at first, but I now see that it truly shines when you get acquainted with your opponents deck and follow, which cards and how many have been played. That will of course add to the game length and maybe even AP (for players who really like to calculate their odds), but that's a minor issue. 
Also - the artwork and figures are just pure amazing!

Drako is an asymmetrical game for two players, with one player leading a team of three dwarves who are experienced dragon hunters and the other playing a red dragon that has spread terror amongst local peasants. The dwarves have managed to trap the dragon in a shady valley at the foot of the mountain where it lives – apparently dragons can't resist the smell of freshly slaughtered sheep – but despite being in chains, the dragon is still young and ferocious, providing the dwarves with the difficult task of killing it without being killed themselves.

Adam Kałuża (K2) is not a one-hit wonder. Drako is a simple, light assymetrical game played on a very small field of hexes, but it works fine and it does not want to look more than what it is - it's more Dragonheart than Neuroshima Hex! and I mean it as a compliment.

Asymmetrical risk management with tactics. Easily taught, quickly played. Eye-catching.

The size of the box might mislead you into thinking that this game will be longer and heavier than it is. It's in the category of "filler". Drako won't stay in my collection forever, but I'm glad to have it.

I've played this with kids, and in that context I might add a point to my rating.

Drako is a very interesting asymmetrical two player game in which one person plays as a dragon, and the other plays as three dwarves who are trying to kill it.

There are two unique decks of cards.  Players use the actions available to them on their cards to attack, move, and defend against each other.  If the dragon is killed the dwarf player wins.  If all the dwarves are killed, or the dwarf player runs out of cards the dragon player wins.

The pieces are top-notch.  The dwarves and dragon are all detailed minis (that are begging to be painted), and the small board has nicely rendered artwork.

Drako is a short, fun, tactical game of move, and counter move.

Another winner from Adam Kaluzo. (K2 was my 'family game of the year' in 2010.)

When I read the rules I thought that Drako had some similar mechanism to K2: it's card driven, this time you start with a choice out of 4 cards.

But the gameplay is quite different. I like the assymmetricallity of the 3 dwarves versus the dragon. The game is very tense, and the theme comes across.

Oh and the game looks great too, there's plenty of detail on the dragon and the 3 different dwarves miniatures.

Well, this isn't the most strategic or tactical game.  But what it is, is FANTASTIC!!!  Why?  Because it's something that I can explain to my son in 10 minutes and finish playing in 20 minutes, and we both have a GOOD time.
My son (now 13) is not a boardgamer per se :( he's a video gamer ).  But I can twist his arm every now and then to play a variety of games (especially if it involves some of his friends), even more complicated ones like Power Grid.

The real problem stems from THEME/RULES.  If the game has a mediocre theme with longer / more complicated rules, I see his mind drifting off.  Hey, even I have to force myself to pay attention during rules explanations by others.

Where this game shines is the simple set of rules, awesome theme, and quick play time.  That makes this game a WINNER in my book.

Underappreciated (or under-available?) asynchronous game.  Seems well-balanced and very tense throughout.  Feels a bit odd that the dragon's best strategy is one of avoidance - but this doesn't detract once you have a few games played. 

Nice to see now on yucata.de (though unsure how I feel about being able to see the card remaining counts for each side)...and still hoping that the was-in-development expansion (Troll vs. Elves!) sees the light of day.

Highly recommended.

RATING: 7
An elegant asymmetrical abstract where the three dwarves are trying to slay the dragon before their deck runs out. You get two actions a turn which may be to draw 2 cards (hand limit of 6) or play a card. Cards offer a variety of move, hit, block, etc, some with choices, some with doubles. The problem is the pesky dragon has cards which allow him to fly (usually to the other side of the board) so if you spend actions to move closer without actually netting him (another card) to stop him flying, you could be wasting actions. And as you're on a timer, wasting actions ain't a winning strategy. Eventually you'll also be able to target your hits towards his wings (stopping him flying), legs (stop him moving) or his head (stopping his flame) which creates different end-games. I like the way you're constrained by the cards. There are real choices to make on what to do based on what you've got. There's the right amount of luck to groan and cheer about. It seems closely balanced. It's over in the perfect length of time. There's lots to like.

Good fun game. Love the setting of 3 dwarfs against a badass dragon but that the dragon has to actually play defensive. I can see how the game can depend a lot on the card draw, but if you start with a crappy hand you know that at some point this will invert to a good hand.

Overall very good fun. Looking forward for more plays.

I was left feeling flat with this game.  After three plays I find that there just isn't enough here to get me to want to come back.  The draws are just too random.  It seems like the correct play is almost always obvious and its just a question of whether or not you have the cards to do what you need to.

I think it's perfect 2-player game.
-fast
-easy rules
-asymmetrical, but balanced
-great theme
-some randomness, but you can minimise pretty much
It can be easy game to play even with children, but for 2 experienced players it is quite hard game with a lot of thinking. You have to manage your hand and prepare some combos. Both players have separate card decks so there is no situation that one is drawing all the best - if you have at the moment better hand than oponent it will change very quickly.
And I love the idea of 2 actions per turn.

I recommend this as the best 2-player, fast game which you can use as a filler or play multiple duels in row.

Nice components, but not a deep game. The dragon has very few defensive cards, so he has to evade most of the time. I do not think that there are that many meaningful decisions. As a dragon player you can make your opponent think that you are defenseless, but then counter and attack your opponent in the next turn. As a filler when you wait for others to arrive, this game is fine, but I doubt that the game has much replayability.

Great board game for 2 players for playing a few fast games and change sides every time, because the strategies to follow are different. It´s a light, casual, abstract but with theme, tactical game, ideal for newcomers to modern board games, at a very good price, easy rules, and with a very good miniature quality. I like its illustrations too: I think they´re in tune with the subject. Perhaps negative point is the excess of air inside the box (such a thing as it happens to "Splendor", for example...). Well, it´s a game that may burn over time if you play it too much but, finally, as I mean, I think it's good for playing it a few games occasionally.

RATING: 7
"Drako" ist eines der Spiele, die mich am meisten positiv überrascht haben. Der uninformierte Spontankauf dank des niedrigen Preises hat sich als äußerst vergnüglicher Filler entpuppt. Das Setup dauert keine zwei Minuten und das Spiel selber ist nach 15-20 Minuten vorbei. Die exzellente Balance der asymmetrischen Zwerge-gegen-Drachen-Taktiererei sorgt für durchweg spannende Partien.

Sehr empfehlenswert!

Drako jest jak szwajcarski scyzoryk; śliczny, praktyczny i każdy chce go mieć ...ale kiedy trzeba coś zreperować to i tak idziemy po skrzynkę z narzędziami.
...i taka jest właśnie ta gra - krzyżówka planszówki, karcianki i bitewniaka. Pięknie wykonana (nie licząc wypraski...detal), szybka w setupie, tłumaczeniu zasad i samej rozgrywce ...idealna jeśli nie mamy kilku godzin na "Twilight-a ..." i tylko młodszą siostrę za przeciwnika (oczywiście w roli Smoka) :D

This is a cute little asymmetrical 2 player game.  Dwarfs capturing a Dragon is the theme.  My Son loves it and that may influence my rating a little but you have a simple game with some hand management and spacial elements that plays quick.  Very Fun.

A really nice asymmetrical game for 2 players.  I like the hand management and timing aspects of this game.  There's a lot of cat and mouse, but since the board is small there's only so far to run.

Nice bits and very streamlined rules.  This is a good 2-player game, but not a great one.

The asymmetric play is great and it's a fun theme.  Although I wasn't too impressed by the game play.  It tended to be a lot of: "Attack," "Block," "Draw".

Always felt restricted by the card draw mechanic and the fact that I either do something from very limited choices, or I expand my choices and do diddly squat. With the mechanics allowing little more flexibility, this would have been a lot higher in my book.

Played only twice, using both dragon and dwarves. Won both the games. It's quite interesting and simple this game, simple but not without a little amount of strategy. Not only luck will make you win, but having it will make you so happy;)
Good game.

RATING: 5
This rating could really go either up or down. I love the asymmetry, the quick play time (easily under 20 minutes) and the simple set up. But it seems like card draw really determines the winner. For example if you have good defensive cards when your opponent attacks with their heavy attack cards, you've got an advantage. Need a few more plays to see where I end up on this one.

Update: The game seems really dependent on the luck of the draw. One side can just crush the other side if they don't draw the right cards at the right time.

Sold.

First Impression:

A fast fantasy filler.

The game is highly thematic, flows extremelly well and is deep enough to be skill based.

On the other hand, the fantasy theme puts me and several others of my group a bit off, but the most important issue is replayability, which MAY become a factor after more plays.

I like this game, and I'd love to play it again. I'm just not sure if this feeling will last.

I can see why some people like this game but for me it really falls flat.  Playing as the dragon feels weak.  You can hardly do damage, and if you go into the game wanting to hurt everything with all these neat attack cards, the other side gets tons of defense cards to negate them.  So basically you are left with running around, which to me isn't all that much fun.  I will admit I only played a handful of games so far, so I don't have the strategy worked out.  Also, I am playing this over at Yucata and it is possible that the slow gameplay makes it feel worse than it is face to face.

One of my biggest disappointments of Essen 2011. It looks phenomenal, but in terms of actual gameplay I really expected something more from the publisher of the fantastic K2. I found that random card drawing does not mix well with an asymmetrical game - it results in feelings of injustice when you take one hit after the other because your opponent drew better cards than you did. If only the endgame was more of a climax. If only one could make an educated guess with regard to your opponent's handcards (instead of just guessing). Really wanted to like this game more than I do.
UPDATE: Increased my rating from a 5 to a 6. After a few more games, I realized that the game gets better as you become familiar with the distribution of the cards. And as you start to accept that guessing and (especially) bluffing are a big part of its charm. It's a big advantage that it can be played in just 20 minutes or so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not bad what it is - fast, very easy and quite thematic 2 player game. There are quite a bit of hit, defend, hit, defend -type of repetitive actions which I fear might make it a bit dull after a while. But I think there are few ways to make some planning (in the future games).

Gioco per due, a tema Fantasy, e con la particolarita di essere giocato in maniera completamente asimmetrica. Da un lato il Drago tenta di rimanere in vita il più possibile, molto difficile, dall'altra parte i nani cercano di ucciderlo prima che il mazzo di carte finisca. Carino e dura poco.

RATING: 8
great back and forth two player game.  both sides play differently whether you're the dragon or the dwarves.  trying to capture the dragon can be tough and vice versa if you're the dragon trying to kill the dwarves and figuring out which one to go after first can be tough.

Just the right amount of mayhem for this card/hand management combat game pitting dwarves against a dragon.  Nice short playing time and nice components.

RATING: 3
The miniatures, the board and the overall concept of Drako seemed very promising, but the mechanism of blocking the attacks ruined this game for me - you never know which hits can be completely blocked by your opponent as everything depends on the luck of the draw. Even your most ingenious tactical moves can all be stopped by a simple, anti-climactic block.

Also, the player controlling the dragon has very little chance of winning this game and takes a beating all the time as he has very few defensive cards. The only viable strategy seems to be "run and hope that they will run out of cards soon". 

As a more experienced and demanding player I constantly thought to myself: why am I not playing Neuroshima Hex instead?

Very nice 2 player wargame. One plays the dragon and the other plays the 3 dwarves. The Dragon is bigger and stronger but the 3 dwarves have a better combined strength. You use cards to define what actions you will take. It seemed extremely well balanced. But it if you like light wargames.

Was expecting more from this game, but it is really simple and feels bland. You move and attack and block and repeat that over and over again. Sure, there are tactics (when playing as dwarfs, as you have 3 of them), you can move in some better positions, or fly with the dragon and attack multiple targets with a fire breath, but most of the time your clever attacks are blocked. So it is a drag fest to attack and wait till someone runs out of defense cards.

This has gone up in my estimation on further plays. It provides quick, tense, and interesting duels.

Fast game! Great filler game that actually has a surprising amount of depth. I love the chess like moving of the pieces, the deeper then it looks on the surface bluffing aspects, and how the game ALWAYS comes down to the final three cards for my wife and I. Currently we are pretty tied with the dragon and dwarves at about 50/50 win ratio which I believe means it's pretty balanced. We trade off every game as well so that we can take turns making dragon noises!

Asymmetrical, but well balanced, game. I always have the feeling that my opponent has an easier life.. Easy and fast to play, but still rewarding. The only complain is that it doesn't offer many strategies: you rely on doing the best with your few cards and exploiting any mistake done by your opponent. For this reason, after a while, the game becomes less interesting (but still good).

The card combat is extremely simple and light, which may be a plus or a minus for different people. The board is also really small and doesn't have any actual terrain features.

Nice game for 2 players with asymmetrical sides. To me, it feels like a (much) lighter Neuroshima Hex. The is very simple, and I think mad=ny people will be turned off by that that first realization that there's not much depth here. But if that's what you're seeking, this is a fun, pleasant game.

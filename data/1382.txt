RATING: 8
Another personal favourite from the endless list of Knizia’s works. Simple, accessible and yet engaging, it recreates the atmosphere of horse races surprisingly well. Choose wisely the horses to bet on and then maximize the opportunities given by the die, pushing forward your favourites and hindering the others. Every player can move any horse that hasn’t already been moved in the same round, while the three races that compose every game help in keeping the effects of luck to a reasonable level. The final result is that you make your assumptions about the reliability of every horse, but only the race will tell if they'll live up to your expectations. Add a reasonable playing time and you got a really good filler.
Gets better with more players.

Face 2 Face edition. Good, simple components, solid and well designed. A couple of minor complaints: the horses are a tad too big for the track and some of their colours are more difficult to distinguish from one another.

I am not surprised but a bit stunned at how much fun this game is. It's about the best "nightcap" game I've played. Even with 2 players it's still tons of fun yet stays competitive and simple as can be. Although it's not just always about winning the race it does qualify for my second favorite racing game.

Played this at Gaspcon and really liked it!  I don't have any racing games, and this one was a blast.  I'm a bit surprised, but leave it to Reiner to surprise me with a game that's entirely dependent on dice rolls and swearing when the horseshoe comes up instead of the saddle!  Received for Christmas from Kristen <3!

RATING: 5
Some clever stuff going on with the different payouts, steady vs. sprinter horses, etc., but way too long with 6 players. When we played, the choices felt forced, since the best horse in each race was obvious. Even with the threat of a lower payout, betting 2 on the best horse seems optimal because the less-popular horses don't get moved as much.

Interesting, though I feel it needs to play faster. Perhaps multiple dice with numbers on them to resolve turn order might help. It's a Knizia game, so there's more going on under the cover than meets the eye. Still, it sort of drags and the kids lose interest after the first race as a result. Good filler game, if nothing else.

The bidding markers and money chits could be of a better quality. Otherwise a great game.

Winner's Circle offers great times for fans casual betting games. All horses are different thus making the race interesting until the very end as there might well be a stag emerging from the back of the pack on the last second just before the victory lane stealing the win. I also like that players get a chance to contribute to the outcome of the race by choosing a horse to move on their turn, so the game is not totally out of players' control. Exciting, I would say, if you like speculation and betting.

There are multiple different versions around, but the one I've played could have used better quality components. In addition to what I've mentioned before, the colours of the horses with their jockeys are hard to distinguish. I'd strongly suggest that you paint the jerseys in different colours and numbers so that you can quickly identify each horse.

This is probably the most fun game I own.  There is not the depth of strategy of some other games, but for pure fun, it's hard to beat.
Both my daughters (7 and 9) love playing as well.  At first they didn't get the strategy of moving the leader a low number if you didn't bet on it, but after this was explained, they got it.

There is a somewhat cutthoart aspect to it, which my daughters can handle very well now.  

I find the components to be more that adaquate.  The card could have been just cards, but they are actually tiles, the hoarse are 3d plastic.

My 7 year old rating would be infinity.

Great game, but hard to get players to play more than one race.  (The game requires three.)  That turns this into a filler game.

Update: It really is a good game, though, when you do get to play 3 races.

RATING: 6
+ Betting on horses is fun; Trying to hedge your bets and knowing when to push your luck makes it a tense game.
- The turn order change feels a bit clunky.


Why it's previously-owned:
It's too light for what the group wants to play.  If we're not doing a party game or hidden-role game, we want something with a little more meat to it.  
This got traded for High Frontier.

It's a roll the dice and move game....but what a roll the dice and move game!!! It's one of the best games I have ever played! Dr. Knizia has transformed the roll-and-move genre into something interesting and just plain fun! Strategy, there's little of it, but strategy (weirdly enough!) is the most important part of the game, and the strategy is entirely at the level of betting. It is tactics, however, where Winner's Circle shines, as you're deciding which horse to actually move: benefit myself, or slow down a horse I haven't bet on? Classic Knizia tension, and uncharacteristically well-themed for the good doctor.

Fun game if you like horse racing.   There is a certain amount of bluffing in this game.  You have to make someone think you have a bet on the same horse as them to get them to do something that helps you.  Once they find out the've been had they may be a little perturbed. Play with a good crowd, I've seen this game get ugly.

RATING: 8
A very fun and easy betting game to play by Dr. Knizia! The new edition of 2016 by Dicetree Games is the best by far and I highly recommend it. Painted horses, metal coins, two stacks of cards to play either Royal Turf or  Winner's Circle, a larger tableau than some other older editions and after so many years it has enought variants to keep thing interesting for our gaming sessions! All of these contribute to a really good game becoming more visually appealing and enhance the replayability.

The only other game similar to this that I have played is Long Shot and while both games certainly do have their differences, both games have proven to be a lot of fun.  Some aspects I especially like about Winner's Circle are the simplified betting mechanisms (compared to Long Shot) in that the bets are made at the start of each race allowing players to focus on the race element and through how horses are moved, in that if lucky you can really move one of your horses ahead or halt/ slower the progression of your opponents horses.

[Alea Royal Turf version] After a bunch of plays, I've kind of cooled on this one.  Partly because it seems someone's always out of the running early on, but mostly because, well... the whole game kind of boils down to hoping you roll one of those special single-symbols.

*** UPDATE MAY 2008 ***

Raised 5 rating up a tick.  What can I say?  It grew on me a little.  It still sucks to not roll anything interesting, but the betting/bluffing is okay, and the 2-player game was much better than I expected.

Evaluating the horses and betting is pretty interesting.  But once we started rolling the dice and moving the horses it got a bit dull.  It wasn't awful.  Just quiet as we rolled and moved, rolled and moved.

Maybe it was just our group, but we couldn't get too excited over the drama of a big roll or close finish.  There are some decisions to make here, sometimes.  Do you help your horse or hurt another horse?  But much of the time the choice is obvious.

Afterwards, we had a really interesting discussion on betting strategy and horse evaluation.

So the game is kind of a mix.  I like the betting phase much more than the racing phase.

A really easy to teach and play horse racing game that captures the feel of the races quite well.  As a themed game for Knizia, it is one of his best.  Game is light, but player strategy raises the level of the game (especially if the 0 bet bluff token is used).  Horse movement is by die roll, but which horse is moved with each roll is the decision of the player.  The random order of the horse cards for each race ensures that the races will vary from game to game.  A very good and truly fun game.  [GTI Code: TGCL]

This is a really easy game to learn with very little downtime between turns.  It is roll and move, based on statistics each of the horses have.  There is betting and a high amount of screw factor, however, thus far I have found the screw factor quite enjoyable as everyone gets it turn in and turn out.  A neat racing game that I can't wait to table again.

Alea Small-Box #2

[i]Posted: 10/16/05, Rated: 8[/i]

Apparently it was zoo day today, as we played with camels and horses.  After exploring the desert, we decided to relax a bit and bet on the ponies.

The horses are randomly placed on the board, with an opportunity to examine their movement cards prior to betting like a post parade.  Players take turns placing betting markers, allowing them to go for long shots by taking unwanted horses.  I prefer open betting as opposed to the variant which allows for hidden values.  The open betting feels closer to the parimutuel system used at the track.

I am repeatedly surprised to discover that beneath the seemingly simple rules of a Knizia game lies quite a bit of strategy.  The movement of the horses is a lot of fun as you try to help your mounts while hobbling those of the competition.  I do wish that an eight- or ten-sided die were used, so that the distribution of symbols could be more interesting, such as 3-2-2-1 (instead of 3-1-1-1 on a six-sided die).

[i]Royal Turf[/i] is a lighter game that still retains some nice depth, and that captures the thrill of horse racing.  We'll definitely play it again, and it's another good candidate for non-gamers.

Royal Turf (Earl Grey)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Royal Turf is a betting game. It's set on a famous enlish racetrack and is played through 3 races. The last race the bets will be worth twice as much in winnings which can make the game hard to predict.

Each player can place 3 bets during each race. 1 of the 3 bets counts as if you made 2 bets on the same horse. Bets are made blind but other players get to see which horses the other choses to bet on. The player with most winnings always start the betting sequence. 
The races are always with 7 horses which position is randomly selected through cards. How good they are for that particular race is always selected by the same cards and then a custom die is used when moving horses. 
Each horse have 4 different specialities with symbols that tell how far the horse will move if the die ends up showing that symbol when a player then decides to use his die roll for that particular horse.
It was not too complicated to learn but did require explaning. This is where the tactics come in. The die has 4 different symbols and the symbol resembling a horse occupy 3 sides (50%) There are reliable horses with a good number after the horse symbol, usually not higher then 7-8 moves and then unreliable horses with very few moves after their horse symbol but all the way up to 15 moves in another more rare symbol.

The goal is to successfully make sure the horses you have bet on finish in the 3 first spots aswell as try and hinder horses other players have bet on in order to be the final victor with the most winnings in total. What I found is that if you get an early advantage you can quite easily safe bet the last round on horses other players will try to catch up with.

All in all it proved fun and easy, however not the best game I've played

A light filler despite the big box. Needs to be played at a pace to keep the momentum and interest up. Players who take minutes to ponder their moves will suck all enjoyment out of this game for the others.

Very good game for any number of players. You choose whether to advance the horses that you bet on or to "hose" your opponent's. There is some luck involved and a horse far behind can suddenly jump ahead and win the race. However this just makes the game that much more of a riot. Sometimes no fun if your way behind in you earnings.

Nice Knizia game with a horse racing theme. Though it is a roll and move game, the hidden bets is fun. You have to 2nd guess who's actually trying to help your horse move and who's against you. Make sure you always use the "0" bet chips. This creates the ally vs adversary scenario.

RATING: 8
I think this is a good gateway game. Also seems like a good game for kids, and for a group of 4-5. Great game for the family - mine love it! It's got a good blend of luck (throwing that dice and getting the big move payoff for a generally weaker horse) and strategy.

It seems very luck-based at fisrt, but you can create your own luck once you understand the mechanics.  Deeper than it looks, my only issue is that it  takes longer to play than some other games like it.  Stupid horse!

Seems like it would be a good gate-way game.  There's a good chunk of luck, but enough interesting decisions to keep a gamer entertained for a race or two (three races might be a bit long).  I would be willing to play this every once in a while, but I don't think I would ever buy it.

A not-bad pseudo-gambling game for a group of people looking to not think a whole lot and have some fun.  Almost all the strategy is in placing the bets.  The race is a no-brainer as everyone else at the table will invariably tell the roller his best move with each roll.

My rating for this is an average of 6 if you have 4 or less players, and 7 if you have 5 or more players.

Earl Grey, all the way!  I prefer the original [i]Royal Turf[/i] over [i]Winner's Circle[/i], which eliminated the familiarity with the horses.  Having random horse names associated with each color made it harder to follow through the game.  I liked the presentation of [i]Winner's Circle[/i], though the betting tokens, which seem to be the one thing in this edition where the size was reduced, are too small.

Cmnt for WC:  I am a big fan of WP&S and of course, this isn't as detailed.  But, it's a fun game nevertheless.  It's also pretty easy to get into and much, much quicker than WP&S, which will get this one to the table more.

Own RT, as well.

RATING: 9
I love all the silly horse names in this game.  There is something satisfying about betting on a horse named "Regret" and cheering it on to the finish line.  It's not an overly strategic game since you have a limited control of how the race pans out, but that's why they call it gambling.

Update: It pains me to say this, but I had to drop my rating from 10 to a 9 because Winner's Circle isn't really a game I want to play more than once or twice a year. When I do play, it's an absolute riot, but the game requires some extended rest to build up the excitement of betting it all on Busher.

After one play. Man, what a neat, quick-playing game about betting on and racing horses! Players play secret wages, roll dice that define the range of choices available for moving the horses, and then it's cajole and conive to get the favorites over the line. And while there is a distinct element of screw-your-neighbor, it's mitigated by the bluffing of hidden bets. It's hard to know what exactly will happen until the end of the race. Great fun!

Originally, I really liked this game, but now I feel it's just okay.  (I gave a 0.5 bonus to my rating since this game holds 6 people & plays in an hour or less).  You really need to play with blind bids and bluff chips (zeros)... my most recent I have played 3 games with open-bids and they were not as engaging.

The Winner's Circle version adds a lot of variety to the horse traits... there are >20 movement cards and one is randomly assigned to each of horse for each race (compared to Royal Turf where there are only 3 different versions of each horse).

This is such wacky fun, yet with a few Knizia flairs (horse's stat-line); I think my rating may actually increase.

As a race-game nut, this one's become a must-have for me, for sheer fun-factor. Nice presentation and big chunky horse-minis (colorblind-unfriendly though they are) just add to this great gaming-experience.

I played at a local gathering. Nice betting game that really captures the feel of a day at the track. I played the Face-2-Face edition, and I like the horses and cards, and especially the variety of the different types of horses that can be in a given race. The zero bet is a nice bluff, and I like having the bets secret. It's not a deep game, so from a gamer's perspective, I'd give it about a six. But as a party game for two or three couples, it's a fabulous choice, and I'd give it an eight or maybe even a nine. For more players, I highly recommend the very similar Triactor: A Day at the Piecepack Downs, which offers more strategic choices for the players with similar mechanics.

A bit disappointed with this, since game play was a bit dry with 6 players (I got it intending it to be a 6 player game).  I think the fact that players don't uniquely own a particular horse sucks some of the suspense out of it.

A wonderfully simple, yet subtle game that has grown on me. Great with 6 too, which is always an asset. I like the "blind bid" variant at any number of players. There is a great deal of hidden tactics to the bidding, you have to think past analysing the "risk profile" of each horse and look at the risk profile of your entire horse "portfolio", as well as taking into account how the other players affect things.

UPDATE: I like this game, but the new Face2Face edition is a bit overpriced.

A very simply but nicely done betting game.  Players place bets on horses, and then take turns rolling a die to move them around the track, trying to best satisfy their own bets while also spoiling the bets of other players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A simple and deceptively clever rule set makes this a tremendous game of applied statistics, psychology and bluffing.  This is the best trade-off between simplicity of rules to unexpected fun and play value that I have seen.

IMHO, contrary to other reviewers, horses must start nose to tail.  The expected value of every role is identical on every card.  The only statistical edge is given at the starting line.  Statistically, therefore 1 is always the favourite and 7 is always the longshot.  Without the nose-to-tail start, there is no reason to favour one horse over another and there is no game.  Also, betting must be hidden like at the track.

UPDATE:  After spending dozens of hours and dozens of plays, I have measured the die and found that it is not a cube!  Does everyone else know this or is this news.

[Royal Turf, one of my first Eurogames.] This is an good, easy, family-friendly game, very popular with my crowd of gamers and non-gamers.  I highly recommend it if you think you might enjoy it. We only play using Blind Bidding; the zero bid chip does have a significant role to play. I pasted small banners on the horses with the initials of the names--it seems to help. This game is packed with fun and good times. ... (Later) Now I find myself tiring of it because of overplay. It's still a great (smart/light/risk taking) game, but not so great a game I want to play it all the time. Because it's such a crowd pleaser, my friends ask to play it a lot. I'd rather play something else right now, but still play it and still consider it a wonderful game.

Royal Turf is a dice chuck-a-thon, but I make no bones about liking it quite a bit. For the 2 other people who haven't played it: the basic idea is that you secretly bid on horses based on their starting positions and their cards that are revealed for the race. Then you take turns rolling the die which shows 1 symbol 3 times, and 3 other symbols 1 time each. You can then move any horse which hasn't already been moved that round. The different symbols generate a different number of moves for each horse. The top 3 finishers pay out to the people who put down the hidden chips on them. That's it.

This is filler, and it is inherently random because of the dice-rolling aspect, and chaotic because of the way turn order and other players can screw with you, but I still love it. This game seems to capture the feel of horse racing in a way that is infinitely more compelling than the real events are, and stands out to me as a very good entry in the 5 person filler category. The best player isn't always going to win, but the experience will still be a fun one. It didn't make my collection for over a decade after I first played it due to the player count requirements, but if you have a consistent 5+ this is a great one to have on your shelf.

This is a good horse racing game but it's a straggler behind Really Nasty and Win, Place, and Show for me.  I prefer the stronger sense of simulation (like betting based on odds) and the more directly competitive (and sometimes nasty) nature of those games.  That being said, the game works pretty well and has some surprising finishes even if they lack the drama of those other titles.  I like the basic system quite a bit but I just find that I want it to be a little more complicated and a lot more atmospheric.  I guess there's a lot to be said for the simplicity of it, but I just like more that I can bite into.  The F2F version looks great (apart from the really s#!tty typesetting- come on guys, there's a million fonts out there and you pick THAT one?) and despite all the internet whining about the cheapness of the components, the horses are a hell of lot better than the Alea ones.

Very good betting game. Opportunities for bluffing and strategies. It's not rocket science and there is still luck involved but I assure you if you play without thinking you will lose more than what the laws of probability suggest. Some negotiating involved as well.

(2008-11-15) I played a game with 4 others and found it a decent game.  There is luck in the die roll, but significant player choice in actions and some strategy, along with a chance to make things difficult for the other players.  Given that you don't know how the scoring will work out until the three winning horse are determined I don't think it is possible to script game play, giving it a high replay value.

Production: Several of the horse colors are very difficult to distinguish.  This is typical of a few other Face-2-Face games I've played in which the game is perhaps over produced, without resulting in an attractive game.  Play: More interesting with more players than with fewer, but still, on one's turn there usually isn't much choice to be made: move one of my horses far if I can, or hamstring an opposing contender if I can.

Have only played this one with the blind bidding variant, because I don't think the basic game would be much fun. This variant is splendid though. Simple rules, lots of bluffing (should I move Earl Grey 15 spaces even if my bid is a zero ? ;-) ) and there's nothing more satisfying than making someone else move your 2-bet across the line in first place.
Some say this game is too random, but they're terribly wrong.

RATING: 3.31455
A game of chance that requires players to 'let go' and feel some excitement in order to enjoy it.

For me, the calculations were complex enough to get in the way and since in any given roll it's never clear what you want (until you roll for the final horse), there's never excitement when rolling the die.

There is some potential for serious screwage - specially at the start - since a horse can't share a space, so when a few horses occupy all the spaces in front, a horse can end up not moving at all. 

Though this was usually against my favour, it was my favourite part of the game.

The dry number-crunching was too off-putting for me.

The game changes significantly depending on how many people are playing.  In a six-player game, low variance horses tend to do better, whereas in a two-player game, high-variance horses are more attractive bets.  It's a clever design, though -- simple, but intriguing, and appealing to players of all skill levels.

Winner's circle of Royal turf. Het spel loopt over 3 races. In elke race starten 7 paarden met verschillende sterktes en zwaktes. De spelers wedden op deze paarden. Als speler zal men steeds proberen om de paarden in zijn voordeel te bewegen (te beïnvloeden) teneinde een maximaal winstbedrag te behalen. Hoe meer spelers op hetzelfde paard wedden des te groter de kans dat dit paard als eerste, tweede of derde eindigt. Maar het winstbedrag van het winnende paard stijgt naarmate er minder op dat paard werd gewed. Als een speler er echter in slaagt om als enige op een paard te wedden en hij lukt er ook in om dit paard onder de winnaars te krijgen, dan wordt hij hiervoor extra beloond. De speler die na 3 wedrennen het meeste geld heeft verzameld, wint het spel.

A disappointment so far after several plays with five or six players. Each player may have only 6 to 8 die rolls during a race. With so few turns, tactics don't matter, just the luck of the die. Maybe trying it with fewer players or with hidden bidding will change my mind.

Very fun game!  It has a nice balance of luck and strategy, with the strategy mostly being about taking smart risks (based upon imperfect assumptions).  But the brilliance of the game is in the deduction process that takes place as the game progresses.  The added element of some possible bluffing helps in building great tension throughout the game.  I'm very impressed with this design.  

The biggest negative is that it takes too long.  I think this is partly because people don't plan ahead since they want to see what they roll first.  This game would be a lot better if there was a way to make it move faster.

Remake of Turf Horse Racing from Gibson Games.  Players check out the form of seven horse for the upcoming race, and lay bets accordingly.  Three such races are resolved using a clever die roll mechanic, and winnings are paid out.  Most money after three races wins.

Great fun easy to learn game with more depth than you may think on first play. Try calculating the probability of each horse winning and you will find that the long term odds for each horse are identical. That is the average distance moved for each horse, again thinking long term, each turn is the same (5 spaces I think). Lady luck, naturally, plays her part and additional chaos is added by the players. Bet on heavily backed horses for a near certain, but low payout. Or Gamble on a horse no-one else like for big winnings (good luck with that strategy!). My Favourite - Othello every time.

I also played Ave Caesar. The two is quite different even though the theme is the same. You could own both games. Winner's Circle is a bit more complex, but not that much. Ave Caesar is very basic.

I prefer race car games compared to a horse race game.

First thing that should be pointed out is there is a horse named Zev!   That is a nickname of mine and therefore this game is clearly one of the greatest games ever made.  This game lends itself well to betting and bluffing and if you like those two types of games than you should definitely check this one out.  For those of you looking for a racing game (although I'm not quite sure why you do something so foolish.  those games are L to the A to the ME), you should look elsewhere, because that is not at all what this game is about.

2017-11-11 : First play. A betting game with a nice co-operation balance : the more people bet on the same horse, the more likely it is to end up in the payout, but the less payout there will be. With 6 people playing you can really hose the unpopular horse, so this is not exactly a fair game. But it plays fast and we played with the "0" betting chip so that adds another tension point to the game. Totally overproduced of course, just wish they had given the same deluxe treatment to the betting chips.

Each player starts the round by betting on horses (a fake bid token, 2 normal bid tokens, and a double bid token). These bets can set up temporary alliances with other players (assuming both players used real bids on the same horse). After the bidding, the players take turns rolling the die (3 faces are the same, and 3 unique faces) and moving one of the horses. Each horse moves a different amount based on the icon. Horses with higher values on the common face will have lower values on the unique faces. Each horse can only be moved once until all of the other horses have been moved. So, do you move the horses you've bid on to move far and give away your bid or hinder horses you haven't bid on and potentially masking who you've bid on? After the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd horses pass the goal, the round ends. The horse currently in last place is consider to be last place for the race. Payouts are provided on the winning and last place horses. There is less of a payout as the number of bids on the same horse increase. You play over 3 rounds, with the payouts in the last round doubling. 

The game is compact (Royal Turf version anyway), it accommodates 5 - 6 players well, it's easy to teach, and there can be some excitement to it. I don't really like the doubling of the payout on the last round however and 3 races may feel a little long. Maybe my group just wasn't getting into it as much as others. I also wasn't overly fussy on how some of your turns, there will only be one horse capable of moving. There is no choice here. It can also be dull when you keep rolling horse heads. Overall, this is an ok game to play if you can find it at a decent price and have people who will get into the theme.

Simple game but a lot more than meets the eye. There's a fair amount of strategy in picking your bids, both in relation to your opponents and also taking into account your horses' performance. But more than that, the theme is very evocative and creates a very tense atmosphere. Packs a lot for a short, simple game. Moreover, plays very well with 6. Just brilliant.

[2 plays Royal Turf, 3 plays Winner's Circle] This is a very groovy horseracing game.  I couldn't decide whether I liked this or Jockey better, so the clear answer was that I should have them both.

RATING: 9
The beauty of this game is that it really doesn't matter if it's your own turn or another players turn. It is equally exciting. The mechanism is very good: nobody owns a horse, everybody just bets on horses and hopes that their symbols show up most on the dices. With of course the most fequent appearing symbol (by mathematical chance) giving a smaller progression in the race than the less fequent ones. Also a very good game for non game players.

Not as good as Turf Horse Racing, the original edition. You only get 3 races here, the zero bet is pointless, the £100 penalty for last place is pointless. Having horses not sharing spaces leads to too many non-movers and the prospect of horses being lapped!

But, still a very good game, fun backing    the horses and it's all a good laugh. Get this edition and play by the old rules.

RATING: 6
[Betting, Horseracing] [4P:6, 5P:6, 6P:5] Lighter fare, but it's not a completely luck-based game at all. Each of the horses is mathematically identical, as you might expect from Herr Dokter Knizia. Therefore, it boils down to bidding strategy, and then tactics on the horses. Accessible to the non-gaming crowd, yet deep enough to hold the interest of the serious gamers. *** UPDATE: Remember, you must be nasty. Plays best with 4-5 players. Useless with less than 4. It's the common interests that drive the game, and the ability to screw other players' horses by moving them with results of '1' that make Royal Turf immensely fun. 6 is a bit much as you tend to be in bed with too many people, but I'll take it over a game with 2 or 3. Always play with the blind bid chips! Still an excellent gateway game. *** UPDATE: Played the Winner's Circle edition - I do not like the smorgasboard of horses offered. This eliminates the characteristics of the individual horses of Royal Turf, and suddenly leaves the mix of horse characteristics up to chance. I'm not quite sure why Reiner thought this was an improvement. Give me Carmello, Nougat and Sahara Wind any day. (PS: As always, function over form. The horses in WC are nice, but that means little to the game's rating or value to me since the mechanism has degraded.)

Will give this more plays but so far not overly impressed. Played with 3p, want to see how this works with larger player count. Also I think using a 0, 1,1, and 2 betting chip was more than we wanted to remember during our games (we did blind betting, otherwise the 0 doesn't makes sense). Will try this again on Thanksgiving holiday with larger groups and use only 3 bets each (0, 1, 2). Then see how this goes. 

As a positive though I do like that this game plays fairly fast. I can see this potentially re-placing Longshot. Does some similar things but in lesser time, but doesn't play up to 8 like Longshot. I still prefer Turfmaster & Grand National for Horse race theme games. But this one may have some room to grow.

Played once (3x races)--pretty fun, all in all.  It was a hit with exactly the crowd I thought it would be.


EDIT:  Played many, many times since then.  Fun game of bluffing and betting.  It seems like a race game, but at it's heart it's really not, as weird as that sounds.  It's all about playing the odds, and timing the best use of your rolls.  I like this game a lot.

This game amazes me, how when offered no real long term decision making, or any real decisions for that fact it can be such a fun time. Either you push your horse forward or hinder another, most of the time the dice makes the call for you, yet just the sheer hoopla of getting the right roll at the right time and watching the crowd get infuriated or excited makes this game a winner.  I believe this game needs 5 or 6 to work well though.

UPDATE: Nope, it works well with four also.

UPDATE: This one is still fun, but in a crowded gaming world the appeal has worn off a little.  Manilla offers the same fun with a more substantial game behind it.

If you're looking for a game that simulates the moment-to-moment tactics of jockeys and the magnificent animals they ride--move along.  This is a great Knizia game where, on the surface, all of the horses are equally likely to win (with a normal distribution of die rolls, each of them will complete the race in 7 turns).  However, when you add the players themselves choosing which horse to apply their die roll to, you get all the strategy that you expect in the man's games.  Do you bet on the horse that has almost no variance between its fastest and slowest speed, or go for the one that can complete the race in two die rolls--but only if you get amazingly lucky at rolling the die?  Do you take your die roll and apply it to your favorite horse, knowing that there's a chance that someone else could roll better and move it even further?  Or do you use that die roll to consign another horse to the back of the pack because you have no investment in it?  Do the other bets placed on the horse you're rooting for mean that some of the other players will help that horse to win, or are they worthless bluffs to make you _think_ that you aren't on your own?  If you're a Kniziaphile, this game will let you play with numbers more explicitly than any other game that I know of.

It's an interesting little game - very light, yet has some strategic elements.  Don't dismiss this as a simple roll-and-move game!  We've even tried it by placing blind bets for opponents, just to mess around with strategies.  

Plays much better with the maximum 6 players.  Very fun with the right group - cheering and yelling for horses is a must!  With fewer than 4 players, or with players who are reserved, this game  would be very boring!

This was one of the earlier games I purchased.  I've traded it away now because I found the gameplay simple - not necessarily a bad thing - but also boring.  Movement of horses is very transparent in that it's obvious what horses you bet on.  The zero betting chip is very important, as is betting blind.

This game is just friggin awesome fun. I remember when I first saw it being set up and I was like "Oh god, a horse racing game..ugh" Boy was I wrong and am glad that I gave it a chance. I could try to explain the game, but trust me it would sound dull. This is one you just have to play to appreciate. You can never predict which horses are going to do well. I have seen games where the black horse (who starts in the last position) was a total long shot and wound up coming in first place. Trust me, try it and you will most likely fall in love with this game as I did.

Many thanks, to my gaming friend Matt, who intoduced this game to me.

[Original comment] Excellent family race game. Deciding which horse to move, and trying to convince other players to help the horses you have bets on, make it fun with a lot of conversation. I can play this anytime. Excellent for 5 or 6 players.

(December 2006) We've expanded this game to allow 8 players, because it is very popular with our group.

May 2009 -- Our version is called Royal Turf, and we still enjoy playing it occasionally.

2013-November:  This is one of those games that has such simple rules, we don't have to refresh our memory about it each time we play.  We continue to enjoy it.

The components are nice although I can see how the colors of the horses can be confusing.  The artwork on the board is a little bland.

Played a beat up copy of Royal Turf with the Winner's Circle rules. Biggest differences with the two copies are that RT doesn't have the staggered starting line and RT's stat cards are not independent of the horses. Also, played with blocked spots and closed betting, which I think is necessary for enjoying the game.

The gameplay was okay; I was into it for the first race and then it quickly felt like more of the same. I think part of the problem is that there was no tension or excitement in seeing who would move up or when. This is one element of the racetrack atmosphere that I think is captured better in Camel Up with it's fun pyramid dice tower.

I think part of the issue was that we only played with three; five or six players would make for more chaos but also make the betting more interesting. Still, I think this is a game that is fine: I'd play if someone really wanted to but don't feel a need to go back to it.

A.k.a. Royal Turf - this game is an excellent light to medium filler game. You place your bet on horses, but you also have to move them based on cards that move ALL the horses, so you are trying to influence the game in order to move the horses that you have your big bets on while wasting the moves of horses that will bring you nothing by the end of the race.

I like Winner's Circle. The game is chock full of choices, as well as ways to screw the other players over. It is best at a full six-players, where fighting for the long shot and short term alliances become the theme for the day.

[thread=1630656]My review[/thread]

This game has provided some of the most riotous good times I've had in tabletop gaming. The rules are simple, but the interactions and direct conflict are superb. I play with blind bidding, which ups the stakes. The moment of recognized betrayal when another player tanks the horse you thought they were helping--pure gold.

I also love that the horses take on personality and character as you play. My group will sometimes bet on Sysonby, but most of the time we avoid him. There are always a few longshot bets on Regret.

EDIT 12/17: Today, Regret won the race and the pace chip in TWO MOVES. Unbelievable.

Are there strategy in this game? Yes, of course there is, but only if you play all things hidden and with the 0 betting markers. Then it turns out to be a quite enjoyable deduction game (more enjoyable than eg. Quicksand).

[Royal Turf] Nine plays. Fun little racing game that generates lots of laughs when bad things happen to good horses. I think it's at its best with just a few players (3 or 4) and with hidden bets; the guessing game of who doubled down on what and the surprise reveal add an extra element of fun. Obviously you can play with open bets for a slightly more strategic game, but I'm not sure Royal Turf is really a strategic game at heart.

My only criticism is that it feels a bit long for what it is; shortening it from three races to two is probably a good idea.

Ok game, I'm just not a fan of horse races. Reminds me somehow of Colossal Arena, but that was a more fun game for me.

I'm prone to say that the game has become more interesting on further plays. 

Knizia's a freaking genius. 

I need to rate this higher.

RATING: 7
Great introductory game with a nice mix of strategy and luck.  I'm not familiar with the original, just 2006's "Winner's Circle."  Love the betting element.  Okay, so I'm ethnocentric...but for the US release, how about reversing the track direction?  Horse racing here is basically one big left hand turn (counter-clockwise) in the States.

Some people will probably be turned off by this game because "its just luck on the die roll". I very much disagree.

People who can appreciate Mr. Knizia's fundamental principal of probability and its management will very much enjoy it. Unless they are hung up on the theme.

I liken this to another Knizia game, Colossal Arena. Certianly not a clone and will stand on its merit to be sure. 

I really enjoy how his number crunching makes for a nice tight feeling betting game.

I enjoyed this game, but not quite as much as I expected.  I need to play it a few more times to see whether strategy wins out over chaos, and to get a better feel for the type of horses likely to do well.

I'm usually not fond of race games, and horse racing in particular has never been a favorite of mine.  However, Winner’s Circle (formerly released as Royal Turf by Alea Games) immediately struck me. It is fast, fun and has some interesting betting and movement mechanics. Sure, there's luck involved, but the other facets of the game overpower the luck and help make it quite exciting to play. 

As mentioned, Winner’s Circle is truly fun and exciting to play. There are lots of moans and cheers uttered as horses are moved, and it is great fun to cheer your own horse to victory. The decisions to be made with each roll aren’t terribly taxing, but are nonetheless meaningful.  Winner’s Circle does a good job or recreating the quickness and excitement of the horse racing sport.

RATING: 6
Interesting system of moving horses.  Enjoyable light game for the family, with some tactics and bluffing, but not something I would play often with gamers. Quite some luck and gambling, and that fits the theme, but it can be a little frustrating when you keep rolling horse heads, which are half of the die faces. The Face 2 Face edition comes with large and nice plastic horses, and I appreciate that they tried to use realistic colors.

I admit to liking this game a lot more than it probably warrants.  I like the variability of set up, multiple choice in the slightly agonizing decisions, and a little bit of bluffing.  If the race were longer, had more horses, or had more bets it might be just right; but would my friends like it any better?  Probably not.

RATING: 7
[Initial Impression: 7] Easy to learn and loads of fun to play. Note: Use the "hidden bets" variant, even from your first play. Almost every turn presents interesting options, and it is almost impossible to win without some assistance from others (i.e., if you alone have bet on a horse, others will deliberately slow down that horse to make sure you don't win). This game really gets people involved, and is meant to be played relatively quickly. Some players can nonetheless make their decisions inappropriately slowly, so urge them on - it is a race, after all!

RATING: 6.5
A nice luck, player-interaction driven game, probably a decent oen to play with a family.

There is a certain amount of skill in selecting the best horse based on position and card-based probability for each horse, but the interaction of player choices to advance different horses at different times is what makes the game more than a dice fest.

Lovely artwork, though I could wish the horses were a little more substantial than the thin plastic provided.

Very good game this. It's light enough to play with family or younger or more social gamers, light hearted enough to play at the end of an evening as a bit of a laugh but definitely serious enough not to be dismissed.

The only thing that niggles at me is the dice rolling and the plastic horses make it feel like it's being delivered to you as a kids game and yet it CAN be very enjoyable for serious gamers.

Really want this for when I have my own little family to play games with... one day

Played the original Royal Turf with the variant of being able to bluff a 0 bet among your usual bets.

Interesting game that is good with higher player counts. I have to write down what horses I bet on because I tend to forget where my high and bluff bet are. At the beginning of a round, everyone places their bets one at a time until they are all placed face down. Then on your turn you roll the die and move a horse. After all 7 different horses have been moved, then the horse selection is refreshed and the same horses can move again. Definitely some luck and group think here but the betting makes it interesting.

This is one of the few Knizia games where the theme is actually applicable instead of being pasted on.  Players take on the roles of horse track gamblers who place secret bets and then, using a clever and simple dice/horse-ability chart, determine how the race plays out.  Pay-outs vary according to backing and so there's lots of incentive for dark horses and miracles which in turn makes the game tense.  The game gets good marks for length, strategy, simplicity, and theme.  Great title.

Apr08: As I feared, just a little too simplistic for my tastes.  The main decisions are all in the initial betting.  When the race is running, you can cheer the dice some, and have some influence on the results, but not a ton.  If you were all drinking and cheering on your horses to victory, it might be a little different.  The way it stands though, it just didn't captivate me enough.  Of course, horse racing in general doesn't captivate me much.

I've played this a lot over the years and am a little burned out on it, but most players I know think highly of it, particularly as a 6-player game. It's also really great for nongamers.

I don't think this is one of Knizia's [i]very[/i] best games, but it is a great example of his style/genius: This game is super-easy to teach, it captures the theme well (particularly with its abstraction of parimutuel betting), it has interesting decisions but also a good amount of luck (making it family- and casual-gamer-friendly), and at its core it takes math we all understand (in this case, the probabilities associated with one six-sided die) and uses it in ways that make you think "I can't believe no one thought of this before." Most of his best games do these things.

Initial rating 2 plays Winners Circle

Some don't think so but it is the same kind of game as Daytona really, you are racing around an oval track. Of course there are some differences but I'm not sure there are enough to justify owning both really.

Well we also missed the fun in this one (which is the main reason to play this type of game) and I think alcohol would really help to be more immersed in the theme and/or betting real money, maybe then it would generate some hooting and howling because it never happened for us in our games. Maybe the old rules are better so I think I will try them next time. 

Update: 6 => 6.75 Second play of this was much better, if you don't utilize the scewage of the horses it becomes a 'dry' race, with screwage and the right group it is more fun, slightly group dependant and best with full 6.

Rated after one 5-player game.  The colour scheme, while realistic, is horrid for telling the horses apart.  I'm not a huge horse-racing fan so this one didn't quite grab me.  Three times around, with the last round doubling the wagers seems to just emphasize the last round when nothing else is different.  I did well in the first two rounds (tied for 1st), but only scored one in the final and sunk.  Extra plays may reveal more strategy to mitigate the rolls, but it all felt mostly out of my hands.  A light game that seemed a bit too long for what it is.  I will give it an A for theme integration and would play again.

My daughter loved this from age 8 and I liked it as much as she.  The betting adds excitement and it moves quickly.

It´s been years since I last played Winner´s Circle, so I don’t remember much about the game. I dislike racing games so I remember I didn’t like the game very much. I think it is way too light for my current tastes and its theme doesn’t appeal to me. I think they will re-release it this year so perhaps I can play it again. If and when I do I will come  back to write a proper comment. For now I’m downgrading its rating so my current feelings for the game match BGG´s rating system

Very nice racing/betting game. Horses seem to get slower as the game progresses and people focus as much on slowing down the horses you don't favour as speeding along the ones you do.....

Since playing a copy of Royal Turf, I've picked up the Face to Face Winner's Circle version at a nice price. It comes with more variants in the rules and nice horse models both of which are good, but the box is huge compared to the earlier release I played.

This is a fun game to play with non-gamers as well as BG Geeks. If that damn die would ever come up with something besides horse heads for me I'd do a lot better.
I was going to rate the game an 8 after 1 play but after reading the critique here I realized I liked it more than BGG thinks I should.
After reading the old rules I incorporated a merger of the 2 for a realistic horse race.
1)Separate the horses into 7 stacks, each with a different Horse Head value from 1-7. 
2)Players place their bets secretly in turn order on the board. 
3)Horses all start from the same space and more than 1 horse can occupy the same space.
5)Follow all other rules normally.

Royal Turf is one of the best one hour filler games ever designed.

But... I really don't know why Royal Turf was combined with Winner's Circle.  The games are different enough that they should be listed separately.

Japanese version of Royal Turf with Winner's Circle cards included. Components not as nice as the face2face edition. A couple of horse tokens were damaged (stuck to something, but nothing in the box) yet still placed in the box. Would have returned, but bought and shipped from Japan.

A neat horse racing game with blind bidding. It's the movement of the horses that makes the game as each horse can only move once each round. So a player must choose between helping his horse or hurting a horse his opponents have bid on.

OK light night-cap horse racing betting game.  I've only played 3 and 4 players, and I think at that number I'd rather play something else.  Sweet spot I'd imagine is 5 or 6 players.  I'm docking 1 rating point for the awful horse colors that I'm always mixing up.

Update: Tried with 5 and it does play better.  But, downgraded to 4/10, as I've come to realize the horse stats don't mean squat.  If you ignore them, and just bet based on where other people have bet, you will win.  Not much game here, just a social experience, so I'll be willing to play once in a great while just for that.

RATING: 8
I have Royal Turf, which I like more than Winner's Circle for only two reasons. 
1) The horse names are constant and associated with certain general conditions of their movement, Earl Grey always moves one space on a horse head, and Othello always moves 7. For me this gives each of the horses a kind of personality which carries through all of the games, I can identify with Earl Grey, Albino and Sahara Wind they are pretty lazy but every now and then they are prone to high energy spurts of progress...
2) The box is small! Royal Turf can easily be placed in a purse or murse or whatever you use to carry things in, it also fits on a pub table easily. 

Okay anyway, the game is great and plays 6, which is very nice. It's not high on strategy, but it isn't devoid of strategy either. It's always a lot of fun to play as people tend to get animated cheering their horses along.

RATING: 6
This is a decent romp. A light, easy, but still competitive game. Uses a fairly common Knizia trope where the last place becomes important (here, the 7th-place horse-betters are penalized). Nice bits in this set, but (as others have mentioned) the lack of color differentiation between some of the horses is a minus. Better with more players (too few, and there end up being horses no one cares about). I recommend the blind-betting option.

Played recently with 5, they all seemed to enjoy it.

The new Winner's Circle components are really well done, though the colors of the horses can be a little confusing (as everyone says).  I like that there are different variants to try.  My one requirement for playing this game is quick players.  I feel that fast turn-taking helps the game seem more thematically like a race.  Plus, the decisions here are pretty simple.  When players spend more than a few seconds deliberating about horse movement, the game really drags.  I have yet to play three rounds.  Usually by the time the first lap is over, we're ready to move on.  

Traded away.

Just not really impressed with this game. I am not opposed to light games, but this is reall TOO light. Not enough meaningful decisions. There is a slight fun factor in routing the horses to the finish line, but it is over so quickly that it just isn't satisfying. Even my non-gamer friends were neutral on this one...

Might be willing to give this a second chance (F2F reprint) as a family game, but looks like there are a few other horse racing games out now that are probably better.  

Edit: Got the F2F version and have got it to the table a few times. It's easy to explain and you'd think it would be a decent gateway but no one I teach it too is very enamored with it. Will probably trade it...

I am not convinved this game is very deep, but it makes up for that in fun factor.  I'm leaving it over at my Parent's house to have a good fun game that can accomodate up to 6 players. 

The winning strategy seemed to bet on horses that had far (but unreliable) movement capabilities over the ones that could move short consistent distances.

More play will tell.

A fairly good, light racing game. The betting is a bit odd at first glance - when introducing the game, invariably someone will ask "how come there's no odds for the horses?" But they soon realize that the odds are determined by the players themselves - which is more or less how odds are actually determined in real horse racing. 

You need the right group with this game, perhaps with a bit of alcohol supplied, because part of the fun is in cheering for your horse(s) to win the race, and in choosing to make sub-optimal moves for other horses when you get the chance. Seems to work well with any number of players listed, but probably best with four players, overall.

Juego ideal para enganchar a no jugones; bien pensado y equilibrado (es un Knizia), se trata de apostar (secretamente lo hace más emocionante) a qué caballos quedarán en primero, segundo o tercer lugar, dependiendo la recaudación de la cantidad de apuestas que llevara ese caballo (se paga más a los menos jugados, claro). La originalidad es que los jugadores mueven a todos los caballos en función de sus intereses o porque no les queda otro remedio y deben tratar de despistar a los otros jugadores para que no "boicoteen" a sus caballos. Muy divertido.

RATING: 6
Winner's Circle is one of those games that I thought I wouldn't like but ended being pleasant and fun. Betting games are fun and this one, combined with the racing aspect, does it in a simple, yet interesting way.

I must state that this is not even close to simulation, as it could well be a race of karts or even a sack race, as it's all about throwing dice and moving forward. Thankfully, the special racing dice along with the characteristics of each of the horses add enough tension to keep you interesting.

The game isn't confrontational nor deep, but can be played very quickly once everyone is familiar with it, even to the point of ending one race in 10 minutes. That helps a lot in when playing it, as it can fit in perfectly when you just want a game of this characteristics that isn't too long before engaging into something more complex.

All in all, a fun betting game with a clever roll & move mechanism that works well both as a medium filler as well as with non-gamers.

It's only been a day and we've already played this three times and I can't wait to play it again! When I first read about this game I didn't really think I'd like it, but decided to get it after reading so many great reviews and I'm happy to say I'm so glad I did. I love this game! There are tonnes of different ways you can play it (read: variants) and I love that about games. It's not really the betting part I like (I'd like to revamp it somehow by like using money for the bets as well to make it seem like you're at a real track), but I love the rooting for your horse to finish in the winner's circle. The first time we played it we just ran the horses in order of their gate # (we didn't choose which horse to move, we just moved the next one in order) and that was great fun. Sure, there's not much strategy in that, but it was still loads of fun. I wonder what variant we'll try next.

Update: It's now years later and I still adore this game. There's just something about racing toy horses that brings out that childhood glee in me. I got Formula D after this game thinking I'd like it just as much if not more and while it's a good game too, Winner's Circle is still my favourite racing game by far. I also perfected my system of betting with real money and it's neat, but it's not necessary.

This game is fascinating to me.  I have never considered actually betting real money on real horses, having not an ounce of gambling blood in my body.  And I usually steer clear of dice games (games in which a primary mechanic is the roll of the dice).  And yet, somehow, this little number is one of the most fun games I know.  Winner's Circle is pretty much guaranteed to get everyone in your friends circle to curse those @&*#! horses as they walk, prance, trot, canter, and gallop their way around the track.  Excellent gateway game.

Gave this to my friend who loves this game, too.  Since I like a lot more games than he does, I thought it would round out his collection better than it did mine.  Someday, I'll get another copy!

"Have a fun-filled day at the races..." with this lightweight betting game works really well for casual or non-gamers alike as they learn to use betting & bluffing to make the most money.

Betting on horses which have different probabilities of going far on different rolls of the die proved to be far more enjoyable than I expected.  This one has proven to get the group up on their feet whooping and hollering for their horses and against other horses, particularly in the third and final race.  I do prefer Royal Turf where horse starting order is determined randomly by draw and insures a varied field of different skills in the horses (consistent, sprinter, etc).

This game has a lot going for it. Horses (the s/o likes horses). The payout system is simple, yet mimics real bidding in that more bids have lesser payouts per bids. The movement idea is clever in that each horse must move before moving again.

These good ideas aside, the game degenerates very quickly. Roll a horse head, move. Roll a horse head, move. Roll a horse head, move. Etc.

Too bad such good ideas are wasted.

Fun, with nice bits. Great for gamers and non-gamers.

Put number decals on those horses (3 on each so they can be viewed from all angles), else rate the game lower.

Played one 2 player game. I wasn't expecting anything. In fact I was sure that it would be a luck driven boring game. I was so wrong! With 2 players there is a lot of tactic/strategy. Advance your horses, ensure that your opponent horses won't get far. Each small decision is important. I really like the fact that there is 30 or so different horses. It add a lot of variety to the game.

I wonder how the game plays with 4-6 players. I must be more of a party game as players don't have much control over their horses.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I enjoy "betting on the ponies". While the die rolling to move the horses makes the game 70% luck, threre is the idea of screwing with your oponents by making a worse movement decision for a horse they are betting on.

The game suggests 3 rounds, but if people get behind, there sems to be no way for them to catch up in some cases.

A fun Reiner horse racing game.  You begin by betting on horses where you get 1x or 2x the payout.  You then roll a dice and can keep move based on 1 of four die faces.  1 side shows 3x where each other side appears once.  You then choose which Horse you want to move, and move that number of spaces.   Payouts are based on number of bets that are placed on each horse and the horses finish.  You run three races and most money wins.

Good family game of horse racing. Lots of luck, but that's the idea. Usually involves laughs and lots of "come on you stupid, crappy horse" shouting.

First impression after one game.  I laughed so hard at one point of the race that I had tears in my eyes.  This is undoubtedly a Dr. Knizia game, a great game mechanics which has a lot of math with a thinly pasted on theme.  Like all good Knizia games it has layers of depth and is very well designed, to the point of being a standout of its kind.  The game has a mix of calculation, and misdirection, and because it is a racing game it also has the excitement of the race.  Plays quick, does not overstay its welcome.  It can have a runaway leader problem (see what I did there) but it does not matter.  Skill does play a role in this game, even though it has dice.  I can see this as a great gateway game.

I was hoping for more from the game. We've always played with the additional 0-chip and with the "every horse head is unique" variants too.  The randomness feels so dominant that there is little you can do to combat it. Don't get me wrong, there is a game there but nothing pulling me to play it over other title.

I do like the horses though. Nice production quality.

Winner's Circle.  Nice family game.  Simple, and just enough strategy and screwage to make it palatable for me.  I prefer the variety of the colorless horse cards over Royal Turf, and with an included variant you do not lose the Royal Turf flavor (all the "horse head" movements being different).  What I wasn't overly thrilled about was the colors of the actual horses, specifically the three middling brown ones.  Once or twice a race, several people, myself included, had some difficulty rapidly discerning which horses were still available to move.  It is a minor nitpick.  Perhaps they should have added colored saddles or something?

If played with the right group Royal Turf can be an absolute blast! What is the right group? One who really gets into the theme of the game, roots loudly for their horses and who shouts out the name of the horse they want moved on other players turns: "Go Othello!!" "Go Earl Grey". The most important thing is that this game must be kept moving at a brisk clip. Roll move, roll move, analysis paralysis can kill it. One more thing I'll say is that Royal Turf is one of the few games that is great with any number of players.

Played 6 time.
Last Played Aug 24, 2008

This was a fun game.  At first we were all a little tentative, but then as we saw how things turned out we got more and more excited.  It was a lot of fun to cheer on your horses.    There isn't a lot of strategy but there are the fun decisions of help your self or screw your neighbor.

Played a second time with only 3, but the other two had never played it so we opted to play open bidding.  We decided after that game that it was fun but the hidden betting has got to be more fun. 

Tried it with the hidden betting this time.  The bluffing aspect on which horse was your zero was kind of fun.  I'm not sure after one play if I saw much difference other than that though.

I figured out another fun part of hidden betting... if you dicate the reward based on the number of chits not the number of actual bets, then the 0's can screw anybody betting on the horse if it does happen to place.

Fun and light with plenty of interesting choices.  Will need to try again with the blind bidding variant (with the 0, 1, 1, and 2 chits bid face down and not shown until the end of the race).  With open bidding the third round was anticlimactic as the leader was able to correlate his bets with the player in second place.  The Royal Turf variant might also present a wider array of choices.

**********

Have now tried with blind bidding and it is slightly better.  Definitely a solid 7.

Definitely more fun with 5 players than with 3 or 4.  However, it is quickly losing its luster.  After another few plays I might be done with it unless we start playing for real money.

Can be fun, but gets a bit repetitive before it's done. I would rather have 3x "1 bid" chit than the current 2,1,1,0. Game took much longer than we expected. Kinda dry if no-one is willing to mimic a horse-race announcer. I could definitely see my familly enjoying this (hence my fairly high rating), but I won't be begging to play it myself. 
Update: Lowered rating to a '5'. The game gives the illusion of decision, and is definitely prone to AP/downtime, for what should be a fast-paced light fare. Don't see much of a point in playing with more than 4 players.

Light game which was enjoyable to play but seemed to be lacking the flare I had hoped for.  Mainly I feel I would enjoy it more if there was more to lose (ie. players bet money, rather than just win money (or not)).  Very dangerous to be the only one betting on a horse but if you choose to do so I found out you couldn't always rely on The Nouge (Nougat).

Winner's Circle is all about pressing your luck.  The game starts with players putting bids on the 8 ponies that will be in the race.  You can see how well the horses will perform based on what is rolled on the die.  If x is rolled they move x spaces forward.  The bets are placed face down and you have a 0 bet, two 1 bets, and a 2 bet.  This way nobody knows exactly which horse you bet on, because it could be your 0 down there.  Then you roll the die and decide which horse to move forward based on what they get for the roll.  The decision comes down to moving one of my horses, because this is a pretty good number, or moving a horse I didn't bet on, because this is their worst category.  Once a horse has been moved it can't be moved again until all horses have been moved.

Once the first three cross the finish line bets are paid, and you have to give money back if you bet on the horse in the back.  Based on the number of bets and the placement of the horse money is divvied out.  After three races the winner is the player with the most money.

I can see why people would have fun with this.  It is more of a social thing rather than the game play itself.  If you have people that are really vocal, rooting for a horse, trash talking, etc. the game is much more fun.  If people are playing to win, this will be very boring fast.

I gave this a 4 because it has little to no strategy involved.  I actually enjoyed my play of this game, but only because one of the people I played with made it fun.  Him and I were goofing off more than playing, that was why it was fun.

I love so many of Knizia's games that my dislike for this one surprises me. Of course I'm no good at it, but there's more to it than that–I find the betting not fun, the racing way not fun, and the distribution of winnings? Yep, not fun. Passing that one die round and round and round . . . tedious. Traded.

RATING: 6
This game is awesome!   A great way to spend 45 minutes.   The tension builds slowly as each race begins, culminating in a furious dash for the winning post.  I like the way everything is doubled for the 3rd and final race; making come backs very do-able (great for new gamers).  The first two races are mearly opportunities to set oneself up with a bit of cash to tie-break the 3rd main-event race where most of the money is made/lost.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Knizia did some serious math to figure this game out.  Each horse is balanced, though it doesn't really seem like it (I think), which takes more math to prove than I know how to do.  You have many choices to make in a game - which horse to put your basic bets on, which to put your double bet on, and which to put your bluffing chip on.  And then you have to really think hard with each die roll - should you move the horse you've bet most on, trying to help it win?  Or move a horse that's in contention with yours a lesser number of spaces, trying to make it lose?  Or move a horse in the rear of the pack that you've bet on, just trying not to have it come in last (which costs you cash, especially if you have your double bet chip on it!)  I just really like all the choices to be made from turn to turn.  Just enough information is hidden to make the game more than an exercise in probability, and die rolling in a Euro is always fun.  Bumped my rating from 7 to 8 just by writing this comment!  (I have the Royal Turf version.)

racing with hidden bets is fun. you can really choose to have as many or few races as you want, which allows you to play for as long or as little as is desired. i've played with 2 people and 3 people so far, both of them were enjoyable experiences.

the races seem to occur in two bits (at least for me, always seeming to be betting on the last place horse); the first half you are competing for the podiums and the second half you are competing to not finish last.

i'm already planning on taking this to kentucky derby night next year, where hopefully some non-games will enjoy a game fitting for the occasion.

Royal Turf is a game you need to be in the right mood for. It's pretty light and fluffy with a lot of die rolling. Yes, there is a level of tactics and a bit of bluffing but the game play is a bit repetitive after a while. With a larger group it can turn into a decent little party-style game if everyone gets into the game. At the other extreme it can get "mathy" if only played by 2 or 3 analytical type players.

There are 7 horses, each with a different characteristics: they move a different number of spaces depending on the dice roll. Players play secret bets on the horses, and the first three horses pay off. Play over three rounds, with the last round all payoffs being doubled. Game where you can gamble or play the percentages. Hope your opponents don't move Caramello 10 spaces too often! It's a fun light game.

I'm not generally a big fan of Knizia games, but I really like this one!

A neat betting game. You need to bet on the outcome of three horse races. The trick is, the more people who bet on one horse, the lower the payout per bet will be. You need to balance betting on the 'best' horse with betting on horses that you alone will bet on. The races are run by each player choosing to move the horses depending on a die roll. Because of this, it's good to not be the only bet on a horse, otherwise it won't go anywhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

First impression: Game is about blind bidding and dice rolling but not as random or chaotic as it sounds. I'd like to try with 4-5 players but works well with 6 players. (Update: AS LONG AS the players don't overanalyze the game. Hey come on, it's not that serious...)

Gioco sulle scommesse dei cavalli. Regolamento immediato e senza troppe complicazioni. Si lascia giocare per spesso per la sua semplicità.

Risulta più simpatico, e ingovernabile, con l'aumentare del numero di giocatori.

[b]Winner's Circle[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]8[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]Winner's Circle has continued to be a hit when we are gaming with our families. Everyone has gotten into the game so our sessions are always loud and boisterous. As I said before, the game is a breeze to teach so anyone can play. 

Unfortunately the success of Winner's Circle has lead to Camel Up sitting on the shelf for the last year; I'm still a fan but everyone else would much rather play Winner's Circle. While Camel Up isn't a difficult game to learn, it definitely isn't as straightforward as Winner's Circle. Every play of Winner's Circle is an event, even people not playing get into it. I can't recommend Winner's Circle enough, especially if you're looking for a game to play with friends and family not in the hobby.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This is the perfect game to break out at the holidays, we played on Thanksgiving and had a blast. Part of the charm definitely resided in the group you play with, we were quite raucous and I kept a running commentary of each race using an announcers voice. 

The game itself is a breeze to teach, it has very simple betting mechanics and then the race is handled via die rolls (trust me it works). Reiner managed to capture the feel of horse racing since a horse can potentially jump out of no where to steal the race, of course there are also horses which are almost guaranteed to move at a steady pace. This aspect of risk versus reward keeps everyone engaged and allows players to decide how far they want to push their luck.

A definite keeper and near the top of my list for gaming with family and friends at parties and holidays. I much prefer this type of game versus party games in these situations.[/i]

Simply a very fun game to play. Personally, I like it with 3-5 players. You place your "bets" and let the race begin. Though the luck of the dice has a major influence, the "horse cards" can be stastically analyzed inconjunction with die probabilities to "gamble" on the best odds! Play the first few games with open betting. After you get use to the racing flavor of this game, change to the "blind betting" and add the "0" betting tiles. The games gets even more interesting and fun.

A neat filler type that manages to hold interest for an hour. Not a bad feat. The game moves along fast because the choices are limited. We played with the face down betting to speed it up. There are some slight improvements over Turf Horse Racing - prizes are easier to calculate, components are much nicer. 

Perhaps the more analytical face up version might raise the rating a notch, but it may also suck out the light hearted nature of the contest.

It took me a long time to finally play this game and I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked it. 

Captures a lot of the thrill of Colossal Arena (a favorite in my group) without having to deal with the complexity of special powers.

I love the look of the horses and the board. I plan on detailing/painting my horses and adding the numbers. This will ease the color blindness factor (I hope)

Additionally, I think this will be a very fun game to play with non-gamers.

Long Shot kind of killed Winner's Circle for me. Sold it.

Totally luck based and not very fun to play. Basically if you roll a horse you do not really get much choice and that is on 3 of the six sides of the dice. The players who roll the other sides get to choose how the game progresses. Also, the colors are terrible, they look too much the same and it gets annoying.

I've wanted try this game for a long time. It seemed like my sort of game. Once I got it I really enjoyed playing it, but it doesn't seen to excite others the way it excites me. I think it is really clever the way each horse has to be moved every round, and how the dice and card combinations make this an interesting decision every time.

It's dice and betting on horses, but it's fun in it's own way. It plays well 3-6, with it being a touch more "fun" at high player counts. The pieces in the new edition are amazing, although it is a touch on the expensive side, even though I realize it's really not with how nice the actual components are. Fairly luck based, but a good romp.

Side Note: My box came dinged in the bottom of the top cover. It's only cosmetic, but it's a nice gash from shipping. I suppose I can't fault it too much as it came from South Korea.

This game has been replaced by Camel Up as our racing/betting game.

Interesting effort by Knizia, but not my favorite. The card stock is first rate. The horse bits are cool, but would be cooler if they painted on silks.

The mechanic is clever. You don't always get to move the horses that you bet on, and even if you could, you might not want to. I'm not sure about how I like the staggered start and not being able to have two horses on the same space, but it does add to the complexity in handicapping the race and trying to pick the best bets.

Speaking of bets, I am a math guy, and I can't figure out which horses to bet on in this game to ensure victory. Maybe I just can't wrap my head around the factors in this one. I am starting to notice that high variance horses are winning the races more often than not. This is probably biased by people preferring to move a neutral horse 15 spaces rather than 2 spaces. When in doubt, bet on the horses with a rating above 15 in a category.

Fun game for 3 or 4 players.  OK for 2 but not optimal. It's a betting game, not just a straight horse race, and your goal is to try to advance the horses you've bet on across the finish line first.  You play 3 races to see who winds up with the most money.  With the right crowd (horse race fans, bettors, after a few drinks, Kentucky Derby Party) this is a fun game. Good solo, too.

Closer to it's theme material than most Knizia games by a lot.

A huge hit with our group of 3 gamers and 3 newbies.  Not much strategy, but lots of yelling and table-talk.  Plus, everyone, by the end of round 2, has a favorite horse picked out.  I usually don't want to play it when someone selects it, but I have fun every time I play.

I own the small box Alea version, but the new version has better bits, and a much bigger board.  Still, I like the die roll breakdowns of the original better, which ensured horse head rolls that varied from 1 to 7.  In the new version, a bunch of horses from 3 to 4 in horse head rolls makes for a longer, tighter race.

I give this a 7 rating with 3 or 4 players or teams playing only chits of 3 colors.  With 5 players or 6 players, my rating drops to 5, possibly 4.  Thus the average of 6 you see here.  To me, this game is too confusing in following its action (watching bets, etc) without the satsfying payout at the end.  From my experience, anyone victorious had generally snuck into it or hadn't realized they would be victorious.  Lotsa players means lotsa math if you take this one seriously and the game is not much fun if you don't.

This rates about a 7 for game play, but it gets so many laughs I'm bumping it up to a 9.

The simple and brilliant way it works is as follows: People bet on horses, and can - with some (or a lot of) randomness - help the horses they bet on, or screw over the ones other players bet on. BUT, out of the four bets everyone places, one is secretly worth double, and one other is a decoy and worth nothing.

Everyone is always involved. A player rolls the die on his or her turn, and then gets to decide which horse to move. And if a horse has moved, even only 1 space, it can't go again until all the others have moved too. Will the active player help or hurt you? You'll probably give some helpful nudges: the red one will move 9! And only you both bet on it. An obvious move. Or was her bet a decoy and is your horse screwed? She chose to move the black one 1 instead? Nooooo! That's where your double bet is!

There's quite a bit of strategy to it, like placing your bets in such a way that you always have options no matter what you roll, and so it isn't immediately obvious where your fake bet is. And then you have to read the table: which horses will make it without much help, which ones need to be halted whenever possible, &c. But anyone can do well with a lucky die roll. Great for new players, or a great filler for veterans.

RATING: 6
Update: over the years I've grown tired of dice because it isn't an actively engaging mechanism for the players not rolling. On one hand I love the personality/humour that dice bring, but sadly its shallowness used in most games is a turn off. A few dice games can be engaging (Bluff with its communal info, Settlers with the resource hand outs to those fortunate and Finito with one die roll applies to all at the same time) and I thought Royal Turf might join the stables of the few because here the die roll is interesting not only for the change of fortune but there is the deduction process involved: what value bets are placed where, implied by what horses are moved by which die rolled. But sadly this is numerical deduction so hard to memorise.
I scratch my head why this is considered best with at least 4 players as the number of bets, the maths involved and reduced control overrides the deduction (it must be the trash talking aspect that a group provides). Besides the theme although well implemented here (the betting is easy than other King Sport designs) but not a fan of the spectacle in real life.


An excellent example how a few tweaks to the ok original elevates the playing experience: now only one horse can occupy a space (increasing tactics) and there is a payout table (making calculation smoother). But the greatest improvement is the variant of the betting chips face down (greatly reducing analysis paralysis, and introducing fun bluffing and interesting deduction). Add the great production values makes this for me the best of the Alea range. Speculate, bid, roll the die, knobble your opponent's favourites or see your horse dramatically take the lead or fall behind. The best horse racing simulation so far.

Really enjoy this game. It has many delicious decisions in a very simple format. Players MUST see the defensive aspects of the game in order to prevent the  'long-shot' sprinters from winning too often. Own the larger box F2F reprint, components raise this to an 8. Seems to either need at least 4 players or more betting chits if played with fewer to assure that all horses can have more than a solo bet on them. A player that forgets where the zero decoy bet was placed can really give some silly outcomes.

Horses should also all start on the front line and have hidden bets, otherwise the rating drops to a 6 or 7.

11/08/2007: Tried this game out during the recent boardgaming meetup session. I didn't like this game because it involved nothing more than wagering and dice rolls. The fact that some players can collaborate if they bet on the same horse more often than not indicates that all players are likely to bet on the same few horses and push the latter to the finishing line, which means that the main determinant of eventual placing is the amount that each player bets on each winning horse.

Pretty much a very sugarcoated hidden identity movement game with a rich and pleasant theme woven around it. The game is very simply and lots of it depends on dice. I am not sure whether it actually plays better with less players because I found the fact that all horses had bets on them kind of weakened the idea of bluffing in the first place as all the horses eventually moved anyway. Still, the theme is great and the game can really animated a crowd.

RATING: 5
Perfectly average game where you try to balance your bets on horses in order to maximize your pay out.  It gets a little bit repetitive but if you play quick it's not terrible.  Not much tension.  Decisions are usually obvious and takes way too long for how simple it is.

I may have liked it more, but on the same day I first played Winner's Circle I played Manila.  Manila is also a betting game, but in my opinion much better.

There's only so much you can do with a horse racing game, but RT/WC has some nice Knizia touches - do you bet on the long shot horse that moves 12 if you roll a 1 in 6 saddle or go for the favourite with its nice consistent stats? Or how about plonking your "double bet" token on the black number 8 in the hope of not having to share your winnings?

Some good fun to be had with a load of players, and each race is over in 15 minutes or less.

It works, it has some excitement, but lacks somewhat in decisions and theme.  The betting phase is interesting, but the racing phase which occupies most of the time is not that engaging.  For some reason horses can pass each other, but never be neck-and-neck; this led to a horse being almost lapped in our last game (wasted early moves and then several 1's).  I have to concede that I have no interest in horse racing anyway, but without that there is not much game here.  Top Race offers a similar, but more enjoyable, experience for my money.

There is a bash the leader issue since money is open, however, the bluff bet and more players in the game helps offset this a bit.  Fun game.

It's very easy for people to get into, and playing with kids who have no idea what they're doing makes it even more fun or agonizing!  ("This is my horse, ok, I get to move it 2 spaces."  argh!!)  Still, if you're inclined to think out your moves, there's enough to think about for 10 seconds or so each move (and thinking helps probably about as much as it does in backgammon).  Best when played with lots of people (5-6).  When your horse wins, you usually have people who will celebrate with you.  When your horse loses, you have people who will commiserate.  And the dramatic spurts of Earl Gray racing half-way across the track in a single bound!  Lots of luck but lots of fun.

RATING: 7
(+) Elegant ruleset with subtle layers of depth: the play of the blank bid tile, the understanding of the players whom you are with, and the mindgames acheived through intentionally moving a horse (or not).
(+) Accessible, streamlined, and easy to understand ruleset makes it widely appealing. The production by DiceTreeGames is sublime.
(+) The shared space keeps players involved. A single race-track, multiple bets on the same horse, and a singular fate-deciding die.

(-) Seems to drag at higher player counts. Recommend limiting the rounds, though it could be virtue of players' choice to take more time thinking.
(-) A play doesn't really "stick" with you. Perhaps you could have bet better, but perhaps the dice could have "agreed" with your plans better. No use evaluating, as it was all:
(-) Heavily decided by the dice rolls. Perfect tone for this type of game, I might add, but it remains a luck-driven game all the same.

Royal Turf - Like the psychology aspect of trying to determine who has bet on whom.  The fact that all the horses have to move once before another moves again adds to the tension of what move to make.  Game can be played quickly, so easily fits into an evening.  

While many seem to prefer the face-down betting version, I find that the face-up also works quite well as a game.  Especially useful when teaching the game to youngsters as it helps them see the betting strategies involved and understanding the risks (and rewards) of going solo on a horse.

A classic in bet-racing horses games, easy to explain, fun, and fast, in which you´ll bet and try your horses are the winners at the end, and those of the opponents the losers, with dice and cards choices in each turn. It´s a great game with four, five or six players, but it works at any number (of course, it´s a Mr. Reiner Knizia´s game!). It´s a pity that components of this Spanish edition don´t have good quality at all,  especially the board, and horses are difficult to distinguish due to the choice of color. But I think it's worth it because it´s a very good game.

Nagyjából azt tudom megerősíteni, amit itt is többen írtak.
Jó kis játék ez, csak talán egy ici-picit hosszú. Jó lenne, ha a második kört követően véget érne, viszont a nagy szerencse faktor miatt meg muszáj 3 körig játszani.
Kicsit nehéz megjegyezni/adminisztrálni, hogy rejtett tétekkel játszva melyik lóra fogadott az ember, emiatt is vontatottabb a dolog egy lehelettel.
A DiceTree Games kiadás van meg, és azt kell mondjam, hogy lenyűgöző minőségű a cucc! Tényleg! Eleve linen finish technológiájúak a kártyák (nekem ez kedvvenc), a lovak kidolgozottsága, festése fantasztikus. Az egészre a koronát persze a fém pénzek teszik fel!
Külön öröm, hogy ebben a témában van egy ilyen jó játék.

What a great game. Such thrill and yelling at the horses. GO REGRET ! GO YOU MOTHERF $%^&ER DADDY NEEDS A NEW PAIR OF GODDAMN SHOES!

Knizia not thematic my ass. I use the 'all horses start on the starting line together and horses can share the same space' rules, because they make the game feel more like horse racing. My box is split and falling apart, I've had it for so long and played it so much.

I truly don't care if I ever win this one (& I usually don't). I'm just here for the ride. 20 GRAND! RUN, YOU BAST^&D! WHAT ARE YOU , A GOAT? RUN RUN RUN! Chuck that damn die like you mean it, honey!

Pure fun and exciting. Players wage on horses in three races to get the most profit out of it. Depending on some special cards and a die, the animals run around the track, so on each turn every player have to decide which to move, favoring their favorites and being prejudicial with those of the others in order to win.

Can this game really be that good?  You bet!  Really - you do bet in this game (GOTTA play hidden bets, though) but you also influence the outcome of the race.  Shouldn&#039;t really hold anyone&#039;s interest for more than a few games (it&#039;s THAT simple) but it seems to be highly re-playable, and is a rewarding game experience.

I have the Alea Royal Turf version.

A gambling on the horse races game. Has fallen pretty flat with non-gamers. Perhaps its waiting for the right mix of people. Too bad none of the horses are named Hoof Hearted. 

UPDATE: Played at work during some downtime and it went over quite well. I'd describe this game is a decent filler. The non-gamers at work were requesting to play again and one was interested in purchasing it for his dad.

UPDATE: Has gone over reasonably well with two more groups of people. That being said, Royal Turf is just too long for what it is. While I do appreciate how the final round scoring keeps everyone in the game, by that point the interest level has begun to wane. Nevertheless, it supports 6 and is really easy to learn, so it will always have a place on my shelf.

RATING: 7
[2 plays] Beautiful production values, fast play, easy rules, and some light dice-rolling strategy all adds up to a good game.My early impression is that 4 players would be optimum, but the experience is going to depend more than anything upon fun people and keeping the game moving briskly.

Most recent play 9-1-07 with Barb, Mindy, Garrett, Mike G., and Dave Olfe at Net Lake.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun as an experience game but flawed with the hidden face down bet variant as players who win big with their 2 token will run away (even if the bets are lowered because of multiple betters). This is made worse with the double payoff at the last race. Also, group think prevails (people will rarely win if they are the only backer of a horse).

Players are backing horses and rolling a dice to move a horse according to stats on the matching race card. Payoffs for win, place and show but returns diminish the more bets there are on winners.

Still, good quick way to pass some time.

Wager, Racing. Played 3p once. I like it; nice racing system with simple wagering on top. I have some concerns about someone with a good lead keeping ahead by duping the second-place player's  actions; that may be mitigated with more players, but may take the right crowd to accept the relative downtime with many players. In any case, I'd play it again and would like to see how it plays with 4-6 players as well.

EDIT: dropped my rating from 6.5 to 5.0 after playing Long Shot, which is a far more fun horse racing game: less downtime, more horse movement, supports more players better, more actions.

Mindig is szerettem volna egy lovas játékot a gyűjteménybe tudni és Knizia játékára esett végül a választásom. Úgy gondoltam látatlanban a szabályt elolvasva, hogy ez hozhatja vissza legjobban a régi, színek alapján lépkedős változatot. Pontosan annyi "bonyolítás" van ebben a játékban, amivel izgalmasabb, mint az egyszerű kockadobásos és a szép kivitelezés miatt is csak dicsérni lehet a játékot. A játékosok lovakra fogadnak, amelyeknek 4 tulajdonságuk van. Kockadobás után az egyik tulajdonságot választva haladhatnak. Minden lónak lépnie kell, mielőtt egy ló kétszer léphetne. Három futam alapján aki a legjobban fogadott az első három befutó paripára az lesz a győztes. Egyszerű, gyors, izgalmas régi idők játéka életérzést visszahozó társas.

[2011-08-22]
Érdekes, azt hittem hárman nem érdemes leülni egy ilyen játékhoz, de működött. Természetesen 5-6-an az igazi. Eggyel végül csökkentem a pontszámot, mert talán a három futam kicsit hosszúra nyúlhat és egy ilyen könnyed játéknak hosszú ez a játékidő. Kevesebb futammal viszont nagy szerencsejáték lenne.

RATING: 6
Perhaps a little overly long and repetative.  Royal Turf does have a very nice system of movement and betting, but ultimately feels a little random and leaves little control.  This is quite a fun game with the right crowd, but only because it facilitates great energies rather than creating any.  This game is more a vehicle for fun rather than a source of one.  The fact that the last round scores double kind of screws everything up though.  It makes the first two rounds kind of insignificant.  I know that it is a catch up method, but if the game invalidates the first two rounds, then why bother playing three rounds.  I suggest playing one round.  Declare a winner and if you want to play again, do so.  Overall though, I'd rather play Win, Place, Show.

Winner's Circle is not a bad game by any means, and it is pretty fun.  But if you're looking for a betting game with continuous excitement when your winner comes in... Manila is the way to go.

(Royal Turf.) Minimalist game design with maximum playability, but a bit too chancy to be put in Knizia's top tier. Personally I like the small board because it means you can leave it set up on your coffee table. It plays well with 2 but is more fun with more players. (By the way, why are the horses racing clockwise?)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's a fun betting game for one round, but the suggested three extends the game beyond its fun. Also, the design choices are very questionable. Horses are too big for the win, place, show spots, the betting tokens are boring, and the horse colors are too close together (this is a German game - use red, purple, yellow, etc.!).EDIT: I just don't find it very fun anymore.

An enjoyable roll and move game. Playing with more people can help get folks excited about it and this game definitely benefits from shouting. When some poor soul has a bet on the horse with with a 20 for one roll and a 1 for another, they frequently get moved 1 on other's turn.

I will only play this with the face down bets. When the bets are face up, it loses the guessing and players can know exactly how to hurt you best. I enjoy the bluffing and the uncertainy, did he just move that horse to help himself? Or to throw me off his trail?

Wow, I can't believe this is a Knizia game!  Not only is it fun (oooo, burn!), but it is also very thematic.  In typical Knizia fashion the game is very easy to learn yet more often than not presents agonizing choices for the players during their fairly quick turns.  The game components are perhaps slightly below average, with the exception of the large plastic horsies... I mean... horses.  Yet even with those, the colour choices are truly baffling (to the point where it affects game play).  It would probably be more fun to replace the little money tokens with poker chips (or real money...), and I can't imagine playing the game without the "placing bets face down" variant.  All in all, this is the type of game that could definitely be fun for the whole family.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment:  3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

RATING: 6
Mostly random game with a few rules quirks.  Runs a tad bit long for what it is, which in reality is a game of far too few choices.  I particularly hate it when my "turn" consists of moving the last horse with no decision involved then my next turn ends up being the same thing.

RATING: 5
Elegant horse-racing game from Reiner Knizia, with emergent alliances, hidden wagers (and corresponding bluff/deduction) and a clever movement system. Unfortunately it is still too light to be of interest to me, but it's a very good game for what it is -- to say that it is probably the best horse-racing game I have played is to unfairly damn with faint praise.

[FFG 'Winner's Circle' 2006 Edition] {Horse race; roll-and-move, betting; optimal 4-6p} {basic: 6.5, hidden-bet: 7, 1-7 horse startup: 7} WC is an interesting betting game for families. It's full of player interaction and fun. It's fast-paced and very thematic, too. The rule is simple and it can be explained within 10 minutes. It's easy to explain the rule. The scoring mechanic is straightforward. 

Players have to bet wisely and carefully choose how to use the dice. It's equally fun when you push a horse you bet on forward many space or hinder a horse the other players bet on. It's only a tactical game, in which players try to make use of their bets and dice rolls to maximize their gains.  I don't like the idea of 3 horse races.  Each horse race is very independent. I think 3 horse races are used only for (so-called) balancing the luck.  Usually, I play 2 races because a game of 3 races is too long.

The horse miniatures are nice, though it'd be much better if hard plastic and sharper color tones are used. It's quite easy to mix up certain horses now. Poker chips should be used to make the game funnier; the money chips are ugly and not durable. It's not good to have non-durable chips for a game with hidden bets.

This is a quite a good little filler. And yet it seems to take too long to play it. Maybe if you only play 2 races, and the fact that the last race is worth double seems to negate the first 2 races. Must be played with blind bets to be any fun at all.

Winner's Circle is a horse-racing/gambling game done right.  It's very easy to teach and play and has a healthy dose of luck mixed with some strategy.  Sometimes the best move is to hurt your opponents instead of helping yourself.

This is surely not the prettiest game around.

An odd little Knizia game. I hate the production values; the money is little cardboard chits, the horses are too big for the board and ugly colours, but the game itself just about works.

As always with a Knizia, you can define the game by the mechanics - it is a combination of push your luck (do you use your dice roll to move your horse a decent way or hope that someone else will move it further on their turn) and take that (do you use your roll to screw over another horse)?

It's not his best game, but it's fairly good fun, though not one I'd ever need to buy.

I want to like this game, however, I don't think it will hit the table again.  It just moved, ironically, too slowly.  You can't have a horse racing game take over an hour.  That's just stupid.

RATING: 8
Seems like a great filler and has enough pay off for the little time taken, which is good. Hidden betting seems to be a requirement.

Notes on the Winner's Circle Edition. The rules say that the horses should be drawn randomly. I think this creates issues if a horse that moves 6 or 7 on a horsehead roll is near the front. I think it's important to put the steadily-fast horses at the back of the pack like Royal Turf does.

Great racing and betting game. There are enough choices to make including whether or not to move an opponents horse for the least spaces it can get or to move one of your own a lot of spaces. It seems to come down to the wire on who will win a particular race, which raises the tension level of the game.

Easily my favorite racing game. A nice "gateway" game for those new to Euro games or for families, but also one that experienced gamers seem to enjoy. The theme is engaging - we tend to yell "Go, Nougat" a lot (Royal Turf version of the game).

Winner's Circle caught me off-guard.  The earnestness of the box led me to believe that there was vastly more to this game then a roll-and-move.  Well, there is a LITTLE more, but not much, and the end result feels a bit like a children's game.

A fantastic racing game, with a lot of luck involved. People may be turned off of this game as it's heavily luck dependent, and there is nothing you can do to prevent other players from moving the horses you have bet on. But, it's light, plays fast and doesn't overstay it's welcome.

Some great opportunities for bluffing and for screwing your neighbor. And any game where you get to moan and cheer over the roll of the dice is going to be fun. But three races is too long to determine a winner and having the third race count for double money makes the first two races almost worthless.

I enjoyed playing the game. It really bugs me that the horses are going the wrong way!

Has the true gambling feel.  Some games have bets, this reconstructs gambling.  Knowledge on the horses, plus limited control makes this game a sweet fun filler for all.  Has the combination of reacting to the players and the game system.  Few games force you to do both, and this one does it magnificently.  Has curl your toes tension towards the end of the race.  Runs about 15 minutes too long(due to players taking excessively long, but they always seem to).

Pretty cool...I like race games...I like bidding games.  Reiner's got a good one here. Not his best but good none the less.

A potential party game that's a bit too plodding to really be a successful party game. I feel like a good party game needs to move quickly and be lively, while this one is too slow paced and has too much downtime to be a top tier party game. Perhaps the conclusion should be that it's not a party game, but it's a game of gambling on horse racing, so I have a hard time seeing it as anything else, and thus I've crossed it off my wishlist after trying it.

Winner's Circle is a stock market racing game, with an element of bluffing.  And some probability management.  Horses start lined up on the track in a random order.  Each horse has four running distance values corresponding to the images on the die.  One particular image has a %50 chance of being rolled while the other three have a 16.66% chance.  So horse A may run 3 spaces half the time and 16 spaces, 0 spaces or 2 spaces the other half while horse B might run 1 space half the time, and 6 spaces, 7 spaces or 8 spaces the other half.  Players place hidden markers betting either 0, 1, 1 or 2 on four horses.  Then every player rolls the die and assigns it to a horse until you have first, second and third place winners.

The game here is figuring out who is really betting on what horse, and which ones you want to push or hobble.  It does have some random dice luck, but it fits the theme and game depth appropriately I think.  I enjoyed this.

Played at PrezCon 05.  I have only played a couple times, and I have not done the math, but I think all of the horses are statistically almost identical.  You have to place a bet based on your gut, and more importantly, based on what others are betting on.  If you bet alone, you are going to have to rely on luck, because you aren't going to get much help.  If you bet on what others bet on, you will get a smaller payout, and you had better hope that the other bets are real.  In the end, it felt like these factors evened out, and luck was the primary remaining factor.  Fortunately, this is appropriately fast for the weight of the game, and it is interesting deciding how to best use your rolls, but in the end, it didn't seem all that engaging.

Horse racing & wagering game. Horses are defined by unique characteristics on a set of cards that are randomly selected for each race adding variability. Players roll a special die and select a horse that has not taken its turn yet - it is moved the number associated with that symbol on the horse's card. Players can thus assist the horses they bet on (this can involve cooperation as players may have bet on the same horses) or hinder those supported by others. The winner is the player that amasses the most money through wagers after 3 races. The simple mechanics, decent level of strategy, and well integrated theme make this a good "gateway" level game.

RATING: 7
Knizia's horse race game has enough elegant subtlety to fold plenty of tactical points into a game that could have been a roll and move game. I love how you are never actually sure which horse is going to come in. Not realistic, if that's what you are looking for, but very playable. Make sure to play with the hidden bid variant for maximum suprise and suspense factor. Seems ideal for casual gamers and family. Alea delivers it usual high standard for components. Well worth getting!

Favorite Game to play with non-gamers. We yell at the die, and spend most of the game either trying to convince people to screw other players, or  accusing each other of moving the wrong horse. We are all the time mixing up the monkey poop green horse with the baby poop green horse.

The central mechanic appeals here. Also, there is a sufficient luck element to open this game out to everyone, although the game will still favour good play, and those who understand how to manage probabilities. This one should work well with my group.

RATING: 7
Light, amusing game that uses one of Knizia's design signatures -- lots of simple mechanics, delicately combined in a golden ratio designed to appeal to a wide audience.  I enjoy this game.  Not even the most diehard fan of this game will tell you that luck won't play a role, but the races are short, and there's enough bluffing and strategy to keep me interested.  Plays its role as filler well.

RATING: N/A
Short simple game, secretly bet on horses, roll a die, choose which horse to move based on your roll. Each horse gets a random card, so a particular roll might move one horse a long way, another a short way, etc. Decide to move a horse you want to do well a long way, or intentionally move another horse a short distance, since your opponents have bets on that one. Repeat three races, and you're done. I don't feel a need to own the game, but it was fun, the sort of thing you'd play once in a while.

RATING: 6
You really need the right crowd with this game. It is simple but you've really got to get into it to play the full 3 rounds. If you are looking to make a romp around the track, a single round is probably a nice way to spend time gearing up for something bigger.

Great, fun, betting game with bluffing, diplomacy and "take that" gameplay, too. Not really a racing game as you do not have your own horse(s) and horses may very unrealistically move anything from 0 spaces on one turn and up to 20 spaces on the next turn. For an actual racing game see "Leader 1" and "Powerboats".

I loved playing Royal Turf over lunch when I used to work in an office and this is pretty much the same game, although with slightly different betting rules. I strongly suggest using the variant with the blind bets and the '0' bluff chip. Probably best with at least 4.  Not terribly deep, which makes it a fun gateway game. Only problem is the horse colors are waaaaay too similar.  Some day I'll have to paint them to solve that. :-)

We played with hidden bets and the "0" bid, and no one could remember where they placed which bid (no peeking allowed!).  This helped keep things out of AP territory, moved things along at a fast pace, and ended up being a lot of fun!  My only regret is that Regret never made it to the gate.  If that's a bad bet then I don't want to be right.

This is a die-based race with a horse racing theme.  Winner's Circle is a simple game to get a larger group involved, but it's not a quick game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Knizia used to take some heat for forgetting to put the fun factor in his clever and perfectly balanced games. That's certainly not the case in Winner's Circle. It's a game about horse racing and it delivers that experience extremely well.

The horses are rated by a table found on each horse tile that gives a movement speed corresponding to each of four different symbols found on the game's custom six-sided die. After players place bets, the turns are very simple. Roll the die, match the symbol to the horse of your choice and move it the listed number of spaces. Each horse can only move once until every other horse has been moved, so turns become a neat mixture of sabotaging opponent's horses (picking one's that have poor ratings for a given symbol when that symbol comes up) and pushing your luck by not activating your own horses and hoping to trap an opponent into moving one of your horses with their best die roll.

It's fast, fun and just about as mean as you want to make it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun racing/betting game. I really enjoy the tension of the 0 bet and the semi-controlled chaos of a crowded field. Unfortunately, many of the people I play with do not enjoy this game, so I don't get to play it often, but it is fun. I do wish they had done something more to differentiate the horses; I understand the motivation to stick with realistic colors, but it's sometimes hard at a glance to tell which horse is which. I put small stickers with numbers 1-7 on the horses, which has helped a lot.

A great bluffing and calculated risk game.  All the horses will move in a round but how do you get your favorites to advance without giving away your glue factory bet.

Fun game the first couple of times or with non-gamers.  We play bets face down. Funny though, I thought this was better when I first played it a few years ago.  Pulled it out again recently and can't figure out why it wasn't as good.  I'm thinking the 
"newness" and novelty of the game mechanic, horses and betting was a key factor in the beginning.  Now that we know what to expect, the game kind of drags.  We were bored after the first round, and even my 9 yo daughter wanted to move on to something else, but we stuck it out.  We just got tired of rolling the damned horse head when what we really wanted was one of the other three.  So now the game has been nicknamed "Horse Head."  

Roll.  Guess what?  Horse Head.  Repeat 5 more times.  Roll.  Jockey Cap.  Hey, too late, that horse has already been moved using the Horse Head.

Played a few times (with 3 to 5 players). The luck of the roll is quite important in that game, yet it is short enough so that it doesn't really bother me. The race mechanism is clever - and the betting (with the 0-value bets) turns the game into something more elaborate than a mere random-heavy racing game with "take that!" elements.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very fun beer and pretzels game. Doesn't need deep thought, but exciting all the same. You bet on horses, then roll and move them around the track, but unlike "traditional" roll and move, you have a lot of choices on how to use your roll to help your own horses or slow down your opponent's horses. Some horses are "long shots" (may move very fast or very slow, depending on dice and how the dice are used), while other horses are consistent in their speed. During betting you want to line up your bets so that almost any roll can be used in a way that helps you, then during the race itself you assign the rolls to get your horses across the finish line first.

To really enjoy this the most you have to get into it and cheer on your horses (and cheer when other horses get shafted). Go Top Flight!

Works well with kids when you play with open bets. Closed bets add more strategy and makes this more suitable for gamers.

Reasonable light betting game. Which horses do well is largely down to the whims of the players. I can't decide which element brings more randomness to the game: the dice rolling or the unpredictable nature of players, in both betting and movement. Back the wrong horse and it can feel like everyone else is teaming up against you. Back the right one and your opponents can inadvertantly help you to victory.

This was a fun game, but I think it would have played better with the less than 6 player max that I played it with. Either that or it is the company I keep. :) It can't be me? Can it?  On a serious note, I liked the mechanism where by the horses could not be in a tying position, one most always be in front of the other (This mechanism would be an interesting house variant for 'Jockey'.)

Very above average.  It has horses, one of the wife's interests, so it's a given she'll always enjoy it with only mediocre gameplay.  That said, it's far better than it needs to be - it's actually a very good game overall.  The game decisions come in two sets - first betting stage (based on stats), then the horse movement stage (based on betting and stats).  Analysis Paralysis is prevented in both case by the rather limited number of decisions (for the horse movement, for instance, it's basically one of 7 choices, and a rather trinary decision for each - 'good for me', 'bad for opponents', 'neutral').  Plays fast enough, but the limited number of decision points makes it less engaging to me.

Cool theme, betting on the horses you think will do best. It is a simple game, basically you bid (play the variant where the the bets are kept hidden), roll the die, and move a horse. It is also a bluffing game; try to make the others think you bid your best bet on a different horse than you really did. A great betting game by Knizia, along with Colossal Arena.

Alot simpler than Win,Place and Show (which I own and also like). Game requires that you place bets on horses and then gives you the ability to move any of the horses in order for you to try and confound the other players and advance the horses you have bet on.  You can also trip up other unfavorable horses when the die rolls just right.  Good fast pace game.

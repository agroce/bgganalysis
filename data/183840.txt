We've played this quite a few times, with 2 or 4 players.

We've thoroughly enjoyed it each time. Yeah sometimes you just can't get the chains to work for you, but other times it all comes together in a very satisfying way.

It really is multiplayer solitaire - you have no interaction with the other players beyond the possibility that two players might want to recruit the same assistant, but that's all.

Doesn't seem to matter though, we're still keen to play it, probably because we're chasing those elusive production chains...

El diseño del juego está muy chulo, es un juego de cartas, como un gestión de recursos con posibilidades de transformaciones en cadena, y diversas tomas de decisiones importantes. (Parece un agricola/LeHavre de cartas, que encima el ilustrador es el mismo xD).
Su defecto quizá sea el azar, sobretodo cuando salen las cartas de mercado, es muy determinante. Pero en general un gran juego que apenas ocupa nada de espacio! (como 2 barajas de naipes).

Oh my, what a game. As the name suggests this game is all about producing and converting goods. The difference is that this time all you have is cards. No cubes to push. No meeples to place on board. No dice to roll. No coin to pay. No counters to flip. Just cards to draw and shuffle.

Cards are jampacked with information needed for multiple ways to use the cards. What surprised me though, was that I did not have any trouble reading the symbols. This has been achieved by placing all the information you need at each phase closely packed into the same corner of the cards. Thus you are only looking at one corner at a time and forgetting about the rest. Some of the ways cards are used are really abstract, especially the resources at the market, since they do not involve you ridding yourself of the cards. It can be a bit confusing because sometimes you pay something, sometimes you do not. Furthermore, the cards can also change form and value depending on where they are placed.

 You really have to admire the effort to produce a game of such depth and multiple mechanics with using 110 cards only, and most of all, to making it work. 

As an experience the game is nice. There are so many ways to you can combine the cards to make the most efficient production line. This is the very essence of the game. Players are building victory point generating machines which transform resource to goods which are transformed again into even more valuable goods, and so the cycle goes. I also liked the fact that you are given a chance to run your whole machine once at the game end. It feels really satisfying to utilise the full potential of your creation at least once in the game. There are so many other games in which you would have needed just one more round to pull that big move, but here everyone is given a chance to do that. It also has an impact on the strategy since you can be aiming at that one big production round instead of just drowning the world into cheap crap.

So there are a lot of positives, mostly related to design achievements. However, there is one big mood neutraliser - the game just was not that exciting. I really do admire the design and thus would like to rate the game higher but the whole production chain thing was a bit dull. The game itself is good and I certainly would play it again but there is nothing to rave about.

:thumbsup: Having each card function as a resource, building, or good is an excellent way to cut down on components.
:thumbsup: There is a nice challenge that arises with each play and varies considerably with the order of the cards.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The assistants can be a hit or miss, either granting excellent bonuses or not coming into play.
[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The play area can get messy with the way goods are placed, although this is easily remedied.

:thumbsdown: The theme is practically nonexistent as economics and mechanics take center stage.
:thumbsdown: At times, pure luck plays a major role in determining the outcome of a turn or entire play.

1st play: Fast easy card game with tableau building. Love the Klemenz art and the decisions are tough. Lots of interesting cards and potential combos as well as a condensed playtime with lots of decisions.

2nd play: Ultimately this game is a near-hit.  The resource conversion game is neat if you get the right cards for it but it doesn't seem like there's enough control to do that.  Instead it's lots of random goods and hoping for the best in a push your luck style game with too much game around it.  Port Royal does the same push-your-luck stuff a lot better.

Get resources, convert them into currency, buy buildings that earn more money and gain victory points.  Build your engine, play your own game.  Yes, we have been here a bajilion times before.  To this tired mix Oh My Goods adds a pool of shared resources and some uncertainty about what and how much will be in it.  It does play quickly and with hardly any downtime; which are plus points in a game like this.

The style of artwork is familiar from Port Royal.  Once again, it is functional, if uninspired.  Production quality is decent.

Resource management καρτοπαίχνιδο με απλούς κανόνες και μια push your luck αίσθηση. Υποστηρίζει μέχρι 4 άτομα. Ο καθένας ξεκινάει με ένα κτήριο και έναν εργάτη. Στην αρχή του κάθε γύρου ανοίγουν τυχαία κάποια υλικά που είναι διαθέσιμα για όλους. Μετά ο κάθε παίκτης διαλέγει σε ποιο κτήριο θα στείλει τους εργάτες του ενώ αν θέλει μπορεί να διαλέξει και μια από τις κάρτες του για να την αγοράσει. Μετά ανοίγουν ξανά τυχαίες κάρτες υλικών για όλους και ο καθένας βλέπει αν μπορεί να βάλει μπρος τα κτήρια που έχουν εργάτες.

Κάθε κτήριο γράφει πάνω τι υλικά χρειάζεται για να δουλέψει αλλά και τι υλικά παράγει. Αν τα υλικά που χρειάζονται δεν είναι διαθέσιμα μπορείς να συμπληρώσεις πετώντας τις αντίστοιχες κάρτες από το χέρι σου.  Όλα τα υλικά έχουν μια χρηματική αξία και με τα χρήματα αυτά αγοράζεις νέα κτήρια ώστε να έχεις περισσότερες επιλογές και καλύτερες μετατροπές. 

Μπορείς φυσικά να προσλάβεις και άλλους εργάτες ενώ υπάρχουν και passive κτήρια που απλά δίνουν κάποιο ability. Πχ ένα υλικό στο production. Στο τέλος του παιχνιδιού μετράμε τους πόντους που αξίζει το κάθε κτήριο μας, συν ένα μπόνους για τα λεφτά που μας μείνανε.

Δυστυχώς δεν υπάρχει κάτι το καινούργιο. Τα γραφικά είναι απλώς ΟΚ και η όλη μανούρα με τις κάρτες μοίρασε, ξαναμοίρασε, συμπλήρωσε, παρήγαγε, πλήρωσε, με κούρασε δίχως να μου προσφέρει κάτι. Το παιχνίδι δεν σε ενθουσιάζει. :(

Μου φάνηκε αδιάφορο. Το Βουργουνδάκι για το οποίο έγραψα παράπανω είναι σαφώς καλύτερο.

RATING: 4
I like card games that don't take to much time, but this one has a few flaws. To begin with: the point system. Everyone basically builds the same building with almost the same points (2,3 or 4) so in the end, the score will be something like 23 to 24. Basically, whoever succeeds in producing most goods will problably win, although you only get 1 point for 5 money. 
Secondly, you have little to no influence as to which goods will be produced: yes you can choose which facility to use, but if you start with two suns and none of these two cards match your production, you are screwed. 
Thirdly, the rule book is really a mess: the game is quite simple but it is explained SO complex...terrible. 
All in all, I think there are far better games in the genre. Port Royal beats this game in every aspect.

A decent, nicely illustrated take on the San Juan/RFG genre of games driven in considerable part by a push your luck element that fell short for me as a gaming experience.  The end result is a game that while delivering an admirable number of euro building combos in a small package, feels more like a bookkeeping chore than a fun game.

When I first saw this game, I got excited. After all, it has engine building, resource conversion, and artwork that is reminiscent of a euro. But the luck element is so high that this is the type of game that plays you. It is also a game that develops in a very wonky and unsatisfactory way. Overall, I found aspect of it clever but the entire experience lackluster.

There is nothing wrong with this resource management game, but nothing exceptional either. At 2015, it is an ok game. A positive trait: cards are used 3 ways, like in race for the galaxy. A negative trait: the double card draw each round to determine the random resource offer is a bit tiresome.

Initial Impression: The multiuse cards have a clean graphic design and bright artwork. This little cardgame feels like a Rosenburg resource management game in a deck. The number of cards displayed in the marketplace as resources available for all players is determined by a clever mechanism where you keep flipping cards until 2 sun symbols are showing. Next you deploy your worker(s) to a building that you would like to have generate goods. You can take the safe route to produce fewer goods push-your-luck and attempt to produce more goods. Flip more cards in the marketplace, again stopping when 2 sun symbols show up, and determine whether you have enough resources to produce the goods at the building. If the building was successfully activated, you can feed it "chained" resources to increase output. I purchased this game having read that it can be a tough solitaire game in a deck. So far it lives up to its reputation but I suspect the solitaire game will shine more with added expansions.

Enjoy the concepts, however it just seemed to be whoever was luckiest early on and then it was a runaway leader. Maybe 2nd edition rules would help and/or making the game a bit longer (though would need more cards) so that chains are more significant.

RATING: 5
Longsdale in Revolt adds so many improvements to this game, there's no need to go back. 

The base game of Oh My Goods has some interesting engine building aspects, but players may not be able to use those aspects in a particular game. Players can race to 8 building by building cheap, good VP-to-cost buildings, or they can take it slow and work towards a killer production chain. Both ends of that spectrum are a bit of a problem. If you race, unless you get really good card draws and market draws, you will not activate a good production chain. Unsatisfying. If you build slowly, the game can last too long for what it is. Also unsatisfying.

I've rated Longsdale in Revolt an 8, but Oh My Goods a 5.

Kort spel zonder downtime omdat er veel simultaan gebeurt.
Voor mij wat te veel geluk.  Als de juiste gs niet komen voor je engine, dan produceer je niets.  OK, je kan proberen te diversifiëren, maar dan zit je al wat verder in het spel, met efficiëntieverlies.
Engine bouwen, maar je kan het spel snel beëindigen door eenvoudige productiegebouwen die eigenlijk ongeveer evenveel punten geven.

I like this both with the new rules and without.  Without the new rules you really need to make good judgement as to what to do with your resources because you are stuck with them although your two new drawn cards could save you.  Being able to ditch your hand really changes up the game and lets you go for the combos.  Like the quick playing nature of this.  Expansion really lifts this.

Unpopular opinion warning: I'm not a fan of Alexander Pfister. I flat out dislike Isle of Skye, find Port Royal to be far too random (and where choosing to bust, which isn't fun, is a viable move) and bad with 2, Broom Service to be mediocre, and Mombasa to be a somewhat disparate collection of mechanisms with a distasteful theme.

Nevertheless, I rented Oh My Goods! That, and the elusive Great Western Trail, are the only two I haven't played. As people continually rave about him, I feel I should try all his games to see what I appear to be missing.

So far, Oh My Goods! is my favorite (Mombasa would win if it wasn't for the theme) but it's still in the realm of "fine" rather than "fantastic" for me. Essentially, the game is a resource conversion, building game.

Pros:
1) Great with 2
2) Always charming Klemens Franz artwork
3) Great concept
4) Small footprint (for travel...it actuallly takes up a fair amount of table space).
5) Great price point

Cons
1) Oh My Luck! -- your draws (which determine your in hand resources and available buildings) and the sunrise and sunset card flops can substantially help or hurt a player.
2) Too many resources so production chaining doesn't happen that often -- that would be a lot of fun but between the substantial number of resources and the luck of the draw, you may run your production chains only a couple of times (or never).
3) Due to the myriad of goods, synergies are hard to come by
4) Runs longer than it should

Admittedly, luck and I are not friends. If that doesn't bother you -- and you like euro production games -- this is definitely one to try. I do enjoy San Juan, Kingdomino, and other lighter games that are random. To me, Oh My Goods! is just short of being a great game. Fewer resources, fewer suns, and more opportunity to run your buildings would have gone a long way to having the game feel more satisfying.

RATING: 7
Initial Impressions:
----------------------
A neat filler game with a dash of push your luck.  You basically have to find a way to get a good economy going, but also have to keep up with other players since someone getting to 8 buildings triggers the end of the game.  This reminded me a bit of San Juan, but I think I actually prefer this.  The art looks to be straight out of Ora et Labora, and it looks really good.  Best filler game out of Essen 2015?  This looks to be a keeper, and looking forward to more plays.

A little card game that has lots of game in there!

There's a lot of luck, but it's the kind of luck that I can manage.

There's different strategies to win the game, but the cheap buildings one seems to break the game, as I never saw anyone winning the game with the high priced buildings. Maybe it is possible if the right cards are played early in the game, but for that to happen you got to have them in your hands... and that is almost impossible.

But the game is fun! It's engaging! And it's fast!

It's one of the most played games this year so far! I wasn't expecting so much plays from a small box that I bought for no reason at all.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ A nice little engine-building game that is fun to play, that come in a tiny box but that is not necessarily a filler (a bit more substance to it, and a longer 45 min. playtime).
++ I particularly like the production chain mechanism, as this is really is fun to watch working out (when it does work).
++ I also like the Sunrise/Sunset mechanism (but I'm not sure it is best used in this game).
++ Relatively easy to teach, fast to set-up, relatively fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- A bit more luck driven than I like, even considering the new updated rules. This affect the satisfaction a player can get playing the game because you need to get a production chain going to be satisfied, and sometime your are not lucky enough to get the last building of that chain (so sometime players have a feel of not having finished what they started, which is disappointing).
-- The game is lightweight, with few paths to victory, and is basically a race to get your engine going (and this race aspect is what maybe give some players a disappointing feel when the luck of the draw is not on their side, as they feel like they could have a chance at winning).
-- The art from Klemens Franz feel sloppy. It is not horrible, but definitely not his greatest work.
-- Even at the 2-player count, you need to reshuffle the draw deck at least 1 or 2 times in each game and this is annoying (even when using tokens for the goods, instead of the cards).
-- Since buildings all have different cost to produce, some of them are not thematic at all (like needing ore to make bread) and I wonder why the designer didn't just made multiple copies of the exact same building to keep everything thematic. I guess this is to be able to diversify the buildings ressource use to better use the random market ressources (because this is important to mitigate luck) but I always wonder how this game could have been with players playing their own ressources from their hand for example.
-- The replayability, at least at the 2-player count, seem pretty low, because there is not much variability in the setup (aside the available assistants and your starting char burner).

Engine-building, goods-conversion game that packs more than expected in a deck of multi-use cards. I shouldn't be surprised given the resume of designer Alexander Pfister, but the game was a nice surprise especially at such a low price point. Players race to be the first to build 8 buildings while trying to convert goods as efficiently as efficiently as possible. The game also has a neat river-like mechanism that adds a bit of randomness and uncertainty to each round. Definitely a solid game in a tiny package and I look forward to trying the expansion in the future!

Very fast filler. I really like the idea of the game and I will never turn down a request to play this game (it takes only ~20 Minutes to play) but it is a tad bit too random. Somehow the combos and actions just don't feel super satisfying due to the unavoidable luck of the draw (even with the "new official variant"). 
For a more meaningful (and longer) version of this game (same feeling) I would rather play Ora & Labora.

For more player interaction and similar mechanics (but yet a very different feel of the game) I would go for Glass Road.

A nice combination of strategic engine building and tactical push your luck in a travelsized card game. It's in a similar realm as San Juan, Nations Dice Game and Tiny Epic Galaxies. Better than most of its video review which often don't take the 2nd edition rules into account.

Update Sep 2016: 
With the v2 rules and the solo variant posted by user peakhope, this becomes a great solo experience, thus the higher rate. The engine building difficulty still exists, so I wouldn't have high hopes for a better multiplayer experience. Looking forward to expansions with more and easier engine-building cards.

---

Multi-use card game, with an engine building element and a bit of push-your-luck too. I found it pleasant, both due to the gameplay but also due to the familiar artwork by Klemens Franz. On the downside, the rulebook seems to have been written in a rush, the engine building is difficult and subject to luck. Overall, a cheap and nice filler game.

Ick. Resource conversion chains are, in theory, nice tools in the designer's toolbox. But not when they're burdened by this much raw randomness. By the time you have goods and money to create a small-ish chainlet, sort-of, the game is nearly done anyway. The swings of fortune in the card row are incredible: in my game I had 4 cards in the final row in one turn, and 19 (!) in the next. Gimme a break. The game reminds me, in a painful way, of the equally ill-fated Articificum which broke itself due to a similar problem: randomness. 

The game also gets deduction for using a cumbersome way to keep track of how much money a player collects. You tend to stack the cards on top of production buildings, but you also need to keep meticulous track of their amount. Not a fan of this solution.

A fairly unremarkable goods conversion game, this attempts to pack all of the complexity of a large game into a single deck of cards. The risk reward system is a little unsatisfying and can lead to very dull turns. I can see it getting play as a travel game, maybe. It'll probably lose out to RftG and Mottainai though as they are just better.

Tableau building meets push your luck, add a pinch of worker placement. Figuring out what and when to build is crucial. Production chains are very potent, but there's no guarantee to draw and build all the necessary components. Games tend to be quite tight due to the way points are spread among the cards.

Pleasant art and quick playtime combined with what I like about RftG & San Juan mean that this has got off to a good start. I'm a little concerned about the element of luck involved. Not that I mind luck, but I've canned several games where it's clear I don't have any hope of winning. Perhaps it's my lack of experience that's the problem.

I don't think I like this game, but I'm not at a point to make a definitive claim just yet.  I really want to like it - I like the look of it, I like that there's a lot of game in a small box, and I love the resource conversion angle.  I had hoped it could provide an experience like Le Havre, but in a smaller and faster box.

The trouble is the randomness, the PYL nature of the market.  PYL games on their own I get: you generally have to make a decision to stop or keep going, and balance risk versus reward.  In OMG, though, the risk comes from putting people to work, which is the thing you need to do to progress.  Then your workers just randomly fail.

That, I think, is what frustrates me.  Sometimes you get a flop from the market that just gives you nothing, no matter what buildings you have, and then you're stuck.  The other guy gets a good flop, and is now far out ahead.  In this sense, it's like Bruges, where the randomness was just too much.  Occasionally you would just get crap that you couldn't do anything with.

That's what frustrates me here.  It's an engine-building/conversion game, but one that randomly breaks, and prevents you from doing what you need to do.  I just don't think PYL works with a heavier Euro game.

This has so many things that appeal to me: Multi-use cards!  Engine-building!  Genuine decisions to make!  However, the push-your-luck aspect feels out of place, some of the buildings seem unbalanced, and it's really (really really) difficult to get your engine going before the game ends.  I suspect most players will be better off just going after raw VPs.

Tons of potential, but it's a swing and a miss for me.

I've found the Holy Grail.

My gf [i]asks[/i] to play this game. She has never suggested we play a game before. Not any game. Not once. 

I'm in shock. She has always been really good at games, but she just doesn't care about them. So I've been looking for that perfect game that will make her excited to play. And looking... And looking...

About the game itself, OMG is fantastic. In Feld games like Aquasphere you flop cards (tiles, whatever, who cares) as a stupid design cop out, effectively deciding a 2hr euro on a random draw. In contrast, OMG is designed around the flop: You flop cards and bet on the result every turn. There's luck, of course, but luck and gambling are the milk and cookies of a quick card game. It works brilliantly.

And what's more, after ten plays light bulbs are still going off. There's much more to it than meets the eye. Nothing packs so much into such a small box. Red7 comes close but my gf has never asked me to play it. OMG has the fun factor in spades!

An interesting little card game. It reminds me of a set collection game but the resource management is definitely in there.

I need to play this game a couple more times.

An odd San Juan like card game, where players rapidly cycle cards through their hands, trying to get a production engine of buildings and goods going.  Cards can be resources, buildings or goods.  It's kind of fun, but feels a little incomplete, or possibly broken, and this is with the updated rules.  Jury is still out on this one.

Borrows some art from Ora & Labora, and has somewhat of a similar feel, so it really made me want to play that instead.   However, on its own merits, it is a solid tableau-building card game with multi-use cards.   The flow of play is quite straight-forward.   You have to assign your workers and buildings midway through the reveal of resources for the round, so there is a lot of guesswork and hoping involved.  That probably will be the divisive point for some gamers.   Also, there could be some issues with combos being unavailable if they are locked up as goods on buildings.   It took much, much longer than advertised and could speed up with more plays, but not to the published time.   This is probably a 60-75 minute game.  I don't believe this is a "filler" at all.  For the price, you certainly get a lot of game in a small card-game box.

2016-01-25 : Very clever and quick-playing engine building game. There's a bit of luck factor in there and the chances you take might not pay off, but play is so smooth and fast that this really doesn't matter. Need to play this again to solidify my opinion.
2016-02-01 : Second play and the luck factor is bigger than I first thought it was - which lessens the enjoyment as you can build the finest engine only to see it not working, which is a bit frustrating. Lowering my initial score of 8 to 6 because of it.

Oh My Goods! Has a terrible name. Thankfully I played it as Royal Goods. This is a multi-use economic resource and hand management card game that has a push-your-luck element to it. Basically, each round you designate workers to buildings. Each building requires resources to produce advanced resources. During the round, there will be two distinct times that you will reveal some cards that will be available to players. Workers are designated between the 2 revealings of communal resources and players must hedge their bets on the best place to send their workers. Resources in the communal pool provide resources to each player (they aren't drafted/expended for competition). If players don't choose correctly, they can supplement cards from hand to try and make their plans work. When initially producing from a building, you can chain additional production at a cheaper cost. After that, you can sell goods to pay for additional buildings. Mechanically it works, and I thought I would like it a lot more than I do. I think this is due to feeling that the cards aren't as balanced as what I would like. In addition, it never seems like you can get big production chains going due to the end game conditions. Some people have commented on the push-your-luck being bothersome in this euroy card game, but that wasn't an issue for me. Could have been better.

TRADED IT!

The game is compact and looks great, but as others have eluded to, the scoring is lopsided and untested. The game lends itself to wanting to make a resource trading engine, but sadly the winner just ignores all this and just scores cheap unrelated buildings.

The rules update did wonders for this game, as players are now able to run all of their production chains for massive points, which provides players with the satisfaction of executing the engine they spent the whole game piecing together. I have a few replayability concerns in that some chains are simply better than others (especially given the changes to the end-game), and there are few strategies to explore. I enjoy playing it, but it doesn't call to me often.

Came across this one at a meetup, bought it soon after.  I've had a chance to play it a few times, it's a really clever use of the cards, how they function as different parts of the game.  Extra points for an ever so slightly heavier game in a small box.

RATING: 6.5
This game is held back from being the great mid-weight filler it could be by lacking more intuitive design and rules. When a game with so few parts generates the need for  clarification as often as OMG does, something isn't quite right. 
I would compare this one with Race for the Galaxy, another card game with a fair amount of prerequisite rules and symbology, greatly increasing the pace of play once learned. Somehow, in comparison, RftG has clearer timing and effects following it's many actions and interactions. 
Oh My Goods! isn't a bad game, and Alexander Pfister certainly made improvements from its first edition. Unfortunately, the rewards of deciphering its play are too diminished when considering other, similar games. It can be work teaching others and eventually you have to decide whether a game is worth the time.

A BIG card only Euro game in a tiny box, that features the iconic art of Klemens Franz and is all about production and efficiency with a dash of press-your-luck for good measure. The game employs multi-use cards, similar to those in Bruges or Isle of Trains, that can be used for resources or as buildings, to represent goods earned, and even to observe the sunrise/sunset!

It nearly always took us 2 hours to play! This is a far cry from the 30 minutes stated on the box. Beware! Filler game it is not. It feels like a standard Euro but it's just in a small box (Alles Kase, Game of Trains) so take that into account when setting aside playtime for this one. Kind of like if At the Gates of Loyang didn't come in that ridiculously oversized box... Near the end of the game there is a lot of reshuffling of the cards that can get just a bit annoying. The cards are used for pretty much everything so once you get those production chains going there is a high turnover. We are always a bit low on cards when nearing game end so I wonder if they ever have a problem in the 4 player game with that...

The first few games were fairly fun (well as much fun as a production chain game can be), as we got to grips with all of the elements in the system and made our combo chains etc. It was a very enjoyable experience and it was very satisfying to come from almost nothing and see your systems take off and produce. Then I decided to try the expansion which made the base game worse for us. While it is a better than average game overall, I literally never want to play it again.

One 2P play so far and need another play to fully assess this one. Took us a while to figure out we could chain using the goods we'd produced on the table. The ostensible fun is setting up production chains that feed your engine; I'm just not sure how much control there is considering the way you get cards randomly. Still, I liked it well enough to want to play it again.

Oh My Goods! was a bit of a surprise as the game is much simpler than the rules might have you believe and once you have the flow of the game down it is quite enjoyable.

There is something quite gratifying about engine building and this is no exception, there are a lot of choices and you are never short of options like you are in many games and while there are some logical choices there is also a lot of freedom.  There's a bit of push-your-luck, but there's also sufficient mitigation; don't like your hand?  Discard it and draw right back up to where you were!  You are never stuck in a rut as is common with a lot of card games where someone can get on a top-decking spree of win.

There are many complaints that the game is too fiddly or complex for what it is.  I think there are two problems that create this: 1) Because the manual was forced into a tuckbox sized game the rules had to be compressed and could stand to have been better laid out; hopefully in future revisions they will put a more complex summary of turn on the back cover; 2) The game requires you to discard cards then draw cars to place as goods, this makes no sense when you could just put the discarded goods down as goods.

If you found you wanted to like The Manhattan Project: Chain Reaction, but found it too simplistic this may be the right step up for you.

This might be okay if you were to play it a lot.  I felt that I got only high-cost cards at the start, and while an experienced player may have known what to do, I was completely lost.  Minus a point for having a crass name.

I also have to say that every time I hear the rules explained they are different.  I wonder how many different versions of this game are being played.

Felt like an unnecessarily complicated version of San Juan.  I wanted to like the game, but seemed like without memorizing every card so you know what buildings work together to build your goods conversion engine, you really were just shooting in the dark about how to progress in the game.

RATING: 5
A good idea ruined by a bad implementation. Luck of the draw is fundamental in this game; if you don't get the right cards to set up production chains, wasting time to try and draw them will destroy you. Rush strategies tend to be dominant, which is pretty sad, since following one means ignoring a good half of the game.

The biggest virtue of Oh My Goods! is... most certainly not the name. No, it's having a fairly complex (okay, it's all relative, but still) engine builder crammed into a small box.

Now there's the question of whether it was worth to try cramming it into that box. Many of the cards are similar, the victory points payout decreases the more expensive a building becomes, and the interaction is restricted to a tiny part of the game that might actually be decisive often enough but then feels rather accidental since it is decided by turn order of all things.

So, lots of cards, many very similar, only a tiny fraction of which will be built each game, and the fraction of buildings that will actually be used and not just purely built for points is even tinier. With buildings being the main VP source and only one build action available per turn, not building typically seems like a bad idea, so the only real decision is whether to sometimes take a gamble on a production building or play it safe. OMG! might get away with it because of its small box and short playtime but that is not satisfactory for the bigger game it purports to be.

Von hinten durch die Brust ins Auge komprimiert sich ein Engine-Building-Kartenspiel auf kleinstem Raum und versammelt auf den Karten Multifunktionen. Dies führt im Falle von OH MY GOODS! dazu, dass ich mich im Bau des kleinen Motors mehr gespielt fühlte als dem Glück/Unglück ausgesetzt zu sein, das Kartenspiele naturgemäss und erfreulicherweise mit sich bringen. Das lässt mich nicht in Jubelarien ausbrechen. Dabei konzentrierte ich mich darauf, der konzentrierten Spielidee gerecht zu werden, indem ich jede Runde ein Gebäude baute und so das Spiel straight über die Ziellinie brachte. Es bleibt die grösste Leistung von OMG sich derart verdichtet in so eine kleine Schachtel gequetscht zu haben. Das verdient meinetwegen auch einen Platz im Österreichischen Spielemuseum.

RATING: 6.5
A lot of game in a small package. Has some clever gameplay. However, I quickly found myself being disappointed by how as soon as your engine got up and running it was over. AND, Its easy to buy all the cheap buildings and end the game quickly. Its not horrible, it really isnt...and for 10$ or whatever it was that I paid for it...really has a lot of moving parts to it that I enjoyed. The market was clever, the muli-use cards were cool...at first pretty intimidating, but soon it all came together to make sense. I think a sweet spot for this game would be 3 players, although 2 played just fine. Overall, it left me wanting more. Maybe there is a way to house rule things?? I shall have to check it out.

Didn't know what to expect here, though always looking forward to trying games that use card for multiple purposes.  But this game really didn't do it for me.  To start, it is one of those "Euro mechanics boiled down to its basic parts" sort of games which can either work for me or not. Not so much in this case. The dryness of the game really clouded over the nice artwork and theme.  Lots of buildings, but you never feel like you are building a "Sawmill" or "Workshop" or whatever. 90% of the buildings do the same thing: turn resources into money. Can feel quite repetitive because of that fact.  Little good ideas here and there, but mostly a rehash of mechanics I have seen countless times and are done better in many other games.  Perhaps a good one for those times you need to fit a game in your pocket, but otherwise it can be safely avoided without missing out on anything new.

There's a heavy push your luck element to this game that you can attempt to mitigate in various ways but never escape from entirely.

I was skeptical about how good this could be (especially given the eye-rolling name!), but after playing it two-players a couple of times, I was pleasantly surprised.  There's quite a bit to think about.  It reminds me a bit of Port Royal - a little push-your-luck game that plays quickly and is fun.

If you enjoy this, definitely pick up the expansion for the solo play as well as extra buildings.

Fun to find a chain to develop.  You probably will not get a great combo every time.  The game feels like whoever can develop a profitable chain early enough can win.  Others will build on the cheap and try to end the game quick.  Building cheap and quick does not always win though it is a viable strategy.  I lost doing that.  There is card luck, as is the nature of push your luck, but that is acceptable to me since the gameplay is quick and has quality decisions.

Sometimes you just come across a game that you know you will enjoy, you finally get to play it and it does exactly what you thought it was going to do. I absolutely SUCKED at my first play of Oh My Goods! I rarely produced, I built bad buildings that didn't synergize with earlier buildings, I often took unnecessary chances that didn't pay off and I got crushed, all while having a very enjoyable time with the game. I really love what this game brings to the table. it's fun, it's fast, it's thinky and two experienced players can probably play this in 30 min, 45 tops. That's awesome. I prey that when I introduce this to my wife, she takes to it because I think this could be our quick and easy two player game of choice. Excellent job Pfister!

Oh My Goods! is fun to play. It is reminiscent of Uwe Rosenberg building games, but simplified to deliver a constant stream of pleasantness while playing. The few cons are that winning or losing is anti-climactic and this may as well be a solo game--there is less interaction than the aforementioned Rosenberg titles--, but what it does well, it does well. On each turn, players hope to build a building and produce at their buildings. Combos blossom here. The chains are easy to see and it is fun to se up something that makes fabric, then use the fabric to make clothing. All of the requires goods, and this aspect is mainly led by a simple and entertaining blackjack mechanic. With the exception of not having enough cards in your hand, the game does very little to limit the fun. Instead, since it is so quick to play, Oh My Goods! delivers satisfying rewards at each step of the process. It is quick and deceptively deep. I played with the recommended expansion additions to the rules. Nine flat rounds flows nicer and opens more strategy than first to eight buildings.

I am sucker for any game that sports the multi-use card. Oh My Goods uses it in a (usually) quick and fun engine builder. The only drawback to the game is one that has been mentioned by many reviewers; the game can be so quick that you don't really have time to enjoy the engine that you've built (and sometimes may not even have time to build it!)

So I recommend playing the game with a group of likeminded builder-types. If you have a player who just want to race for the win, the game is far less enjoyable.

Clever little-big card game that packs a punch in the box. Some Rosenberg (resources/goods conversions), some San Juan (buildings that do stuff). Nicely integrated push-your-luck mechanism. (Typical Alexander Pfister?) Beautiful and functional cards.

But: I and most people I played with feel that the luck factor is a bit to high. And the game is too short for the randomness of the cards. This can hurt you! With only about 12 turns, it can happen, that you never get buildings that work well together.

Also in our first 4-player game we ran into the "very rare" (according to the rulebook) situation where we ran out of cards in our draw deck. Even if the cards turn out to be enough, it's still a lot of reshuffling -- usually every (later) round.

RATING: 9
I know that when talking about Pfister card games, it's usually Port Royal that gets all the buzz. However, I believe that this game is even better, although comparing these games is hard, because game mechanically they have pretty much nothing in common. I am awe with how much game can fit inside the tiny box the game comes in. There's nothing but cards, but they are multi-functioning cards. Engine-building game. I like the theme, I like the mechanics. The only con for me is that I feel the game is just a bit too short. Being short means that you really have to know what you are doing in order to get your engine running as soon and as effectively as possible. Highly recommended.

Oh My Goods is a multi-purpose card, tableau building game from Alexander Pfister.
It plays reasonably simply, finishes in 30-40 minutes or less, and has some push your luck elements.
This is not a game that will hurt your brain, and it almost falls into light filler category.
It's a typically well thought out little game from Pfister- I am enjoying it, but I also hope that the thematic expansions will create more interest in the actual play going fwd.

Tiny box, somewhat meaty game.

All the cards serve several functions based on how it is played (ie: as a building, a resource, etc). Has neat chains of "oh I build this building to collect meat. There is this building I can build that turns meat into something that sells for more money" which is neat but relies a lot on knowing what kinds of cards are out there (ie: are you looking at a building that is in a long production line?) and getting lucky enough to draw those cards.

The expansion adds randomized events, more chances to do production chains, and a game timer. GET IT.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
probably I don't get the game, as I feel that I have to push your luck so much to get the production started: the game I had both were determined by the fist 2 rounds of the game, where the other player were able to produce goods on their fabric while I wasn't. In this way they jump started their production while I was 2 turns behind the production.

Luck is involved in:
-drawing the cards
-first market fase
-choosing which plant to produce (based on both the raw material in your hand and the first market fase)
-second market fase
-discarding the right card for the next fase

I'l probably would give it another chance with on house rule, to reduce the luck of the game and enable a little bit more strategy planning: the second market fase becomes the first market fase of the following turn.

I saw a lot of negative comments for this game, but what many saw as negative, I saw as positive. Multi-player solitaire? Check! Thinky filler? Check! Kind of lucky? Check! I took a chance on it and boy am I glad I did! It's super fun and has a great weight to time ratio for me and my wife. It has a lot of interesting mechanics, too. I love the multi-use cards (ala San Juan) and the card combos or "chaining" as the rules call it. The luck factor is NOT too high. The game is about finding ways to develop despite luck. The luck is what makes it exciting. Very smart little game!

I was very excited to play Oh My Goods! Alexander Pfister is a great designer and I was expecting great things from the game. I also love games in which cards serve multiple purposes (one of my favorite game mechanisms), but the game was a disappointment for me. It seems I love Pfister´s heavy games while I dislike his lighter games (I never really enjoyed Port Royal).

The rules of the game can be explained under 6 minutes. Playtime is under 60 minutes.

I like the art of the game. The theme is ok, but you don’t really feel it through the game.

The title is kind of weird!

Gameplay has some very interesting ideas, I really like how the chain of production works. Trying to get a good combo is also fun, but I feel the luck of the draw is too much and it completely eclipses the strategy of the game. No matter how well you plan your turn, luck will decide if you can turn on some buildings and produce with them. I know you can use resources from your hand to do this as well, but the luck factor is very high and uncontrolled. There is a caveat though, I didn’t read the rules so perhaps there could be a mistake, but my friend assured me we played it correctly. What a letdown. The push your luck mechanism feels similar to Port Royal´s, but I was expecting a more strategic game, so the pain of disappointment is worse.

Another bad feeling I have is that the cards seem unbalanced. I know I cannot really judge this from one play, but I suspect (feel) some cards are better than others and they cost the same.

In our game all the scores were very close to each other, I’m not sure if this is normal or not but I think so. When a player can’t build or acquire a new worker in a turn, he falls behind almost without hope of winning the game. I need more plays to verify this point, but that’s my current feeling.

Best with 2 players.

Bottom line, Oh My Goods! was a crushing disappointment, I prefer Port Royal to this one, but I don’t really like either game. My friends compared it to Race for the Galaxy (a masterpiece IMO) but Oh My Goods! can´t really compete with it  I will probably sell it (after I read the rules) along with its unplayed expansions. The uncontrolled luck factor is what kills the game for me, it just has lots of luck.

I really like this game. The layout is wonderful, it's easy to pick up and play, and it's a small deck game. Lots of complexity but you can't play wrong, so everyone is close in scoring at the end.

I gave this to a friend because they really liked it, but I would play anytime.

Fun game! The push your luck element can definitely lead to amazing results or utter failure. The production chains are just really fun to use when you are able to get them to work correctly. Hopefully, some upcoming rules tweaks will make the game a little more strategic.

I've quite enjoyed Alexander Pfister's Port Royal and Oh My Goods! (Royal Goods). I look forward to trying out Isle of Skye and other games of his in the future!

[floatleft][ImageID=2661999][/floatleft]When [thing=156009]Port Royal[/thing] appeared on Yucata I played a few games and concluded that I didn't care for the game. Although I do find push-your-luck to be a fun mechanism in some lighter games like [thing=41]Can't Stop[/thing] or [thing=15512]Diamant[/thing] it didn't click with me in Port Royal. After reading the rules to Royal Goods I thought that it may have hit the sweet the spot for me. Especially since the push-your-luck was a shared experience, with all players gaining access to the same pool of resources each round. Unfortunately for me I found Royal Goods to be rather uninteresting.

Each round players are dealt some cards, then cards are flipped over into the centre of the table one at a time until two suns have been revealed. The cards in the centre of the table provide their resources (icon on the left edge) to all players. Players then assign their worker to a building, with the aim of having that building produce. To produce a building needs a worker present and the correct resources need to be available in the centre of the table, the needed resources are pictured at the bottom of a card on the left. Players can make up missing resources by discarding cards from hand that show the needed resource. Players may also choose one card to build at this time. Then cards are again added to the centre of the table until two more suns have appeared. Then players produce and build. 

[center][ImageID=2662835 medium][/center]

Since you cannot control which goods are available it's wise to build buildings with non-overlapping production costs. It's also a good idea to build things with production costs that you have. Finally you may want to build things that create a production chain. I found these decisions to be very bland, and the player interaction to be inadequate. The only source of interaction is in building certain coloured buildings first so you can hire an assistant who helps with production. This is a major failing of a game whose winner is decided almost exclusively by luck of the draw. In Can't Stop you can heckle your opponents or urge them to continue, similarly in Diamant you can encourage people to stay or leave and in both games this creates a fun light atmosphere centered around the interactive aspects of the game. In Royal Goods you get all the luck with none of the fun.

Contrary to my initial impression, this is not an expansion to Port Royal but a full-fledged and more complex card game by the same author. For such a small package, there’s a lot on offer, clearly beyond usual microgames or card games. Cards can function either as buildings, wares or payment, comparable to RFTG. The aim is to be the first player owning ten buildings. This is achieved by using resources in own buildings to produce wares to pay for new buildings. The resources are randomly determined each round and can be used simultaneously by all players.

The system works and offers good decisions. Nonetheless, some more development couldn’t have hurt. Many of the buildings necessary to fulfill the victory condition won’t be used. Running a functioning chain of two to three buildings with an additional resource generating building suffices, the remainder of buildings is at best interchangeable. I doubt that there are feasible alternatives to the strategy to turn out cheap buildings as fast as possible as the VP/coin relation of buildings is decreasing with increasing price.

Still, a fine game which I personally wouldn’t seek out but would play again.

This is an excellent game. The cards are a bit dense, but once you figure them out, much like Bohnanza, the design is elegant and there are actual decisions to be made most of the time. I really like this... it's very quick with 2 players!

RATING: 6.5
The buildings and production chains are interesting, but the main problem I have with the game is how swingy it gets: decisions are taken on very little information, everything is a gamble, an you're stuck between a high risk, high reward guess, or a medium risk, medium reward guess. All of this destroys the effect of the card play strategy.

Love this little card game from Alexander Pfister, the designer of Mombasa, Broom Service and Great Western Trail. The whole game is a tight little engine builder where you are setting up and running production chains of resource conversion buildings in your village. The expansion adds a great campaign module that makes this into a very different and bigger experience.

This feels unfinished. Good Core elements, but somehow clunky. The market is super swingy and it hence takes ages to build up a nice chain, which you really cannot enjoy because the game will be over right that minute...

Wasn't a fan of this. I felt stuck half the game, the other half I couldn't get anywhere fast enough. Maybe I played it wrong, but the game just didn't feel like I could ever get past buildings with a cost of 5 if I was lucky. Too much luck involved.

The engine mechanics are nicely done, but it never really pays off that well, and it's disappointing that there's zero real player interaction here. It feels like the resource track must have been deliberately toned down from a competitive Port-Royal-style draft to a boringly friendly everything-for-everyone at some point.

Oh my Gosh, Oh My Goods is ultra fun!

The risk/reward incentive for sending your worker out to work efficiently makes every turn a thoughtful joy.

The Market functions like the River in Texas Hold'um: everyone gets to play off of it, but it'll help some more than others.

My only fear is that there is not any catch up mechanic, so the leader could run away with the game.

Building new buildings can often be done from the 1st turn, so the game starts out running!

The cards have a great hand feel and shuffle fantastically.

Essen 15 after the show musthave after recommendations

The game literally takes 7 turns. Sometimes eight
Setting up an engine in that time is hard.

So far (after five games the first player to have an assistant wins.)

got about 8-10 games in so far. So it is definately worth it"s money. 
I downgrade it to a 6 because the race feeling is there.
However in 2 of my 3 last games I managed to get a good engine going and destroyed the competition.
In the game that was lost however the player just set out to build the cheapest building. aim for an assistant by round three or four. And continue to do that and aim for an assistant in the final round as well for an extra 2 points.

will give it a few more shots because I think it is a really clever design. But so far I continue to belief that this is a race and your engine isn't as important as I want it to be. 

A succesfull engine is great fun.
If I am proven wrong and the engine building part is as important as the race. I upgrade my rating to an 8. If it is a race it will be a 4 despite the qualities that it has

Game t more plays in so it has proven vreat value for money.
I find machi koro more sarisfying to play.
The hired workers can really put one player out of it, and f someone grabs him before you

I want to like this game but am severely struggling to do so, although you can churn through the deck by discarding there is a lot of luck in pulling the right cards out of the deck first in building your hand then in what cards turn up for production, there is also no real catch-up mechanism other than hoping your opponent suffers badly in production. On the plus side the "chaining" mechanic is quite good and there is an element of Engine building which fits nicely into the game, perhaps a crib sheet of the chains and card mix may help with probabilities but overall I find this a frustrating game of luck.

Oh, how hard it is to express my problems with this game. Actually... I have no problems with it. It's a resource conversion game that works fine, there is nothing bad about it, it even offers quite much for a card game in such a small box. Still... I just can't name anything that would make me want to play it again. It has the combination and 'mines' concept with kind of awarded cards for collecting certain cards from Splendor; it has the workers from that other Splendor-like game, The Builders: Middle Ages, it has multiple-use cards (including ones simply discarded as money) and commonly revealed cards until an event occurs just like in the designer's Port Royal which I did have problems with... Yet I would play any of these games over Oh My Goods!, yes, even Port Royal, because although I might have problems with that game, Port Royal still feels special compared to Oh My Goods!. So it's a perfectly acceptable resource conversion game; I just can't find anything to recommend it for (over other, better games).

There's a lot to like here. It's a clever, attractive game with a lot of neat ideas. There's an app game look-and-feel to it, and I don't mean that in a disparaging way. It packs a lot into it.

However, it's just not quite there yet. The market is determined by flipping cards until two suns appear, and there are WAY too many suns. It's far too easy for the entire market to consist of only four cards. This kills production, which means players don't play the game for that round. If this happens too often, not much is happening in the game and it's just march of the tiny, uninteresting buildings. The game makes it too hard to actually dive into it and build the larger buildings and get neat chains going. 

I know it had some polishing done between the original version and the current one; I think it needs another round.

This is an utterly themeless game of transforming arbitrary things with arbitrary values into other arbitrary things and/or money that buys still other arbitrary things, all represented with cards (frequently using face-down cards to represent the things produced by other things) with the goal of having the best thing-producing engine.

That's all well and good &mdash; lots of Euros thrive on theme-free engine mechanics &mdash; but this one is held back by the capricious nature of the resource market, which is wildly variable in both variety and quantity.

A simple card, engine building game.  You get a hand of cards and have the option of throwing your whole hand to get a new 5 cards and then add two or just add two to your existing hand.  Cards are laid out in a market that help "pay" for production.  You master craftsman can then work sloppily or efficiently to produce 1 or 2 goods at your building and you select a building to build.  You can take a risk based on what comes out in the market.  You add to the market and then produce goods and build a building or buy a helper.  

A fun little game.  It is better than Royal Goods which did not allow you to replace your hand.  The only annoying element is with people throwing their hands a lot there can be a lot of shuffling.  Otherwise a lot of fun.

Game that seems so much smarter than it actually is. It has the suggestion of being a nice puzzle of mechanics, but it basically comes down to being lucky in the cards you draw and taking the obvious choice. 

Still fun to play this multiplayer solitaire game though, luckily it's short enough not to outstay it's welcome for too long....

Great little engine building game.  The learning curve on this is a bit steep, but it smooths out after the first few rounds.  There's a good bit of randomness in the market, but there are some nice options for mitigating this and still being productive.  The production chain mechanism is really fun and clever, and so rewarding if you can get those 3rd or 4th level buildings to hit even once.  My only negative is that towards the end of the game the deck needs to be reshuffled almost every round, although you can supposedly mix two decks together to fix this.

This is a really, really neat little game with multi-use cards and a small push-your-luck element. Each round you are trying to produce goods, in order to earn enough money to buy buildings and hire assistants. You determine which goods you want to try to produce from the resources available on the morning market and your hand, and you may choose to go for the safe option that you already have the resources to fulfill or are close to having them - or you may push your luck in hope that the evening market will provide whatever you lack. You may also choose whether your worker will work efficiently (requires all resources depicted, but will produce two goods) or sloppily (may lack one resource, but produces only one good) - and you can also do a chain effect by playing the resource depicted on the right to produce additional goods.

I cannot recommend this game enough, it's very strategic and highly re-playable. The buildings are many and varied and there are many different ways you might be able to chain your goods (there are many sets of buildings that work together well), also if you have a bad hand of cards you may each round choose to dump your hand in order to draw a new one, which gives you more chances to get what you need.

Surprising depth and chunky engine for a seven Euro cardgame. Could easily see being produced in a big box with lots of air for a lot more. A real find. Some areas to explore in the game.  It may be there are too many goods to alow any planning but will be fun finding out.

A nice and small-footprint tableau/engine-building game that's quite interesting.

The second edition is much superior but first edition can easily be house-ruled to work the same way I think. It reduces the luck of the draw with the cards.

[u]29-Oct-2017[/u]:  Oh My Goods is a straight up Eurogame in card form.  It's mainly about resource conversion and engine building for VPs.  Cards have multi uses.  And there is a push your luck element not found in traditional Euro style games.  It adds a little bit of chance to your decisions as you hope to find what you're looking for.

The first expansion to the game, Longsdale in Revolt, brings a solo/co-op campaign to the base game.  It provides the player specific goals to achieve under the umbrella of an overarching storyline of the town of Longsdale.  There is an event deck and various cards come into play depending on which "chapter" of the story you are playing.

Thus far, I've played the first chapter five times and the second one once.  I've found the game challenging and interesting with the story-based campaign mode.  I do wonder if the game will become repetitive over time though.  I didn't win any of my five attempts at Chapter 1, but was very close on the last one.  I decided that was good enough for me (I'm not that much of a stickler with these things) as I wanted to see what else the game had to offer.

My first try at Chapter 2 was fun...and also a loss.  But while the endgame goal was new and different, it was basically the same but with different items.  In Chapter 1, you need to end the game with a bunch of food (bread, corn, etc.).  For Chapter 2, you need to end the game with a bunch of building materials (wood planks, bricks, etc.).  Different but the same.  The story is very simple and light (there are only tibits of it on the setup cards and a few others), but I am curious to see where it goes.

I'm also curious to know if the game will hold up once I get to the end of it.  We shall see.

Let me say right now that for €7 it will be very hard to find a game that plays so smoothly and with the choices this one gives you...

At the start of each round you will receive 2 cards to your hand (probably more if you have specific buildings that increase the number of cards received) and reveal cards in the middle of the table and you continue to draw/reveal cards until you have 2 cards with a Sun drawn in it... so you can have 2 cards to 20... it all depends 
These cards will be Goods you can use in your production buildings...

After you have revealed these cards you will have to decide what building you want to produce this round and if you want to build a building that you have in your hand...

The very cool part is that when you decide where to produce and what you want to build you don't have the full information about the resources that will be available for the round... so in some rounds you'll already have all the goods you need to produce in one building and in others you won't have them... so you can go and produce in a building that you already have the resources for or you can "gamble" and choose to produce in a building where you still don't have all the resources... when you make this decision you also decide if you want to go for a full production (meaning 2 goods produced) or if you think it will be hard to have all the resources needed you can choose to make a partial production, meaning you only produce 1 good but you'll also need one fewer resource to produce.

After all players have made these choices you will reveal a second round of cards doing it the same way you did at the start of the round, so you see when you make the decision to produce you can push your luck by producing on a building that gives you more valuable goods but that you don't have all the resources needed hoping that they will appear in this second round of cards.

If there aren't enough resources in the pool for you to produce on a building you can also use cards from your hand as resources, so you discard them and you are able to produce.

Another thing to know is that the majority of the buildings, in the right side have a Production Chain and this is a very cool feature... 

When you Produce in a building you can supplement that production by using the resources/goods depicted on the right side of the building to increase the production by 1 for each resource/good you discard from your hand.

So, to summarize, I was very impressed by this little €7 card game... lots of planning to be done, turn order is very important in some of the decisions you have to make.

EDIT:
Played a bit more and the amount of luck that is present in the game detracts a bit from the rating I first gave it... it's still a very cool game but it can be highly luck dependent and the rating suffers for that

RATING: 5.8
This is a lovely looking card game with some neat resource-conversion ideas; but the game mechanisms are a bit off.  As an example, the heart of the game concerns developing and activating resource chains, but if you actually dump cards from your hand into the production chain, you are seriously penalized the next rounds by having too small a hand size.  Almost a good game, but out classed by San Juan or Race for the Galaxy.

This game has the feel of a filler game that should complete in about 20 minutes but it takes far longer (30-40 mins). The multi-use cards and in particular the chaining ability are reasonable mechanics that would be fine in a game where solid strategic planning is possible however in this game the randomness of the sunrise/sunset draw makes any plans tenuous at best.
The game leaves me with the impression that it is trying to be too clever for its own good and too fiddly for a filler game.

I have mixed feelings about this one, but I think it's slowly growing on me. 

At the end of the first few games I had that terrible feeling of "not having accomplished enough". My engine had just started working when the game ended. Still, I decided to give it some more tries, and each and every time I ended the game with a better engine, and thus with a more statisfactory experience. 

I am not a super huge fan of this kind of games, but I'd rather play this than its big meeple-filled brothers. It's more portable, quicker, and it gives me a better feeling, despite losing a little bit in depth. And this is not a problem for me, since I don't like this specific kind of depth. 

Just beware: there is zero interaction, and there is luck involved.

It is a lot of game in a little deck of cards. I love how the different cards can serve multiple purposes which makes having a bigger game become smaller. The artwork is great and the cards are of good quality. Most everyone loves the game, and it has become one to hit the table frequently due to its easy set-up. However, it doesn't quite scratch the itch I had originally bought it for, and often takes much longer than 30 minutes, especially for competitive players. It was purchased to be a quick game, but expect it to take more than 30 minutes for many players. I do plan on buying the expansions anyway. Great game.

I really enjoyed Oh My Goods. It's a really solid little engine builder where the industries slot together in a really satisfying way. When your weaving mill starts to chain production in to your tailor's shop, you start to appreciate how good it actually is for such a small box; it's almost certainly the deepest game I've been able to find for under £10. What else is nice about Oh My Goods! is that there is practically zero down-time between turns. Each player is constantly playing for the whole game, so no-one has chance to get bored.

You might do well to have someone who understands it explain it to you, however. I didn't find it too intuitive at first and the little cheat sheet you're provided is terrible - turn order is extremely easy to forget. But within 15 minutes or so you start to grasp what really is a good little game.

I admire what this game tries to be and to accomplish with no components other than cards, but the luck of the draw is too high.  This would be less of a problem if there weren't so many cards with suns on them, i.e., such a low chance of getting useful stuff on the market display.  Also, holding out for more expensive cards seems very unwise.  It just makes too much sense to build a bunch of cheap buildings if someone is clearly saving up for a big, juicy one.

Playing mostly solo. 

It's a pleasant experience, and the campaign mode from the expansion helps mix up the experience by giving unique goals for each session with a loose (and branching) storyline.

Choices you make matter, as you need to constantly weigh out each action. The order that cards come out also matters: sometimes things will seem easy, sometimes you'll struggle to build the combos you want. Overall, it's a good balance though.

This has a chance to stay in my collection but also an equal change to bolt out because of suprisingly big luck factor. This could be a huge factor especially in two-player games I think. But I have to give credit to the designer for being able to pack this much game in such small package.

Excellent riff on the Race/San Juan genre with plenty of goods-crack for those who like converting stuff into other stuff. Your game will be really helped by learning the synergy between cards well, and there is no reason not to house-rule it for a longer game if your tendencies lie that way. It can feel a little luck-driven at times: with so many brands of cards, it's often difficult to filter for the ones you need.

[b]Oh My Goods![/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]Wow, is this game good! I ordered this a while ago with the Longsdale expansion, so all but one of my plays include the expansion. In this write up I'll talk in more general terms about the game and get into specifics about the campaign in the Longsdale in Revolt write up. Also, please note I am plying with the 2.0 rule set which came with my edition of the game and all of my plays have been solo.

I was initially attracted to Oh My Goods! because it seemed to be a card game version of an Uwe Rosenberg style euro. This game manages to incorporate a bunch of mechanisms I love in games, engine building, resource conversion, hand management and Klemens Franz artwork. Especially with the expansion Oh My Goods! is a difficult game which is a huge + for me and the game plays so quick, under a 1/2 hour, that I just want to reshuffle and play again. 

Oh My Goods! is a top tier design, what Alexander managed to create from a deck of cards is amazing. There is no doubt that this game has been play tested countless times, there is nothing bloated or extraneous about the design. Game play is smooth and intuitive, but packed with tough choices. Managing your hand is paramount in this game as well as being flexible in how you play the game. Similar to a game like Race for the Galaxy some will complain about the randomness of the card draw, but that is only an issue if you are trying to execute a strategy based on certain cards. If you are flexible Oh My Goods! provides you with plenty of opportunity for creative play. 

I have enjoyed Oh My Goods so much that I repurchased Port Royal because I don't think I gave it a fair shake and my taste in games has changed a lot in the last three years. I am really enjoying these smaller games with simpler rules that still pack a punch.

[i]*I'm playing the game solo so I can't speak to the multi player experience, but I'm pretty sure this would be a multiplayer solitaire experience. I really don't see how you could have much effect over what your opponent(s) are doing.[/i][/i]

"Small tableau/production chain/push-your-luck game. I like it, but it seems more convoluted than it deserves. I want to love this one, but so far it hasn't won me over, and hasn't been loved by others. My 8 rating has slipped to a 7."

What I like:
- I'm a sucker for production chains, and generally enjoy push-your-luck
- Tiny box
- Our 4p learning game only took  an hour, but it feels meaty

What I don't like:
- It's difficult to teach, and has some iconography flubs
- It is really hard to actually make use of production chains
- There is a fair amount of randomness, but it is a short card game, so that's expected

This is more of a game than just a card game. The box contains a larger game than its size.

My favorite "just a deck of cards" game! This is another excellent Pfister game!  I love the two-phase push-your-luck moments with the flop of the resource cards.  I also really enjoy the managing of your buildings/resources.  And then adding in the chaining production is also fun and important.  A whole lot of great game in a small box.  And it gets even better when you add the Longsdale in Revolt expansion!  So good!

It felt a little too fast to get the higher level production buildings into play, especially since the VP seemed rather low on the higher level buildings for the amount of money they cost. There seems to be a bit of push your luck to the game and it kinds of sucks if you fail and don't get the production for your building that round, but it's fast enough and light enough that it's not that big of a deal.

Looking forward to an expansion to this as I feel like this game has potential.

Very interesting multi-use card game. It is very solitaire, so if you hate that then you might not enjoy this one. 

I found it very interesting. In my first game I could see the luck of the draw right off the bat. There is a pretty big luck element that can happen. I see a lot of potential in the small card game. After 1 play I am really enjoying it. Engine building in a small time frame. I can see this being a big hit with all of my groups.

Despite the revised rules allowing the bigger buildings one last hurrah, the smaller buildings' great cost:VP ratio is waaaaaaaay too good. There's a lot of luck in getting the right building to further your chain (why discard ALL cards?) and the game is over so quickly, there is no running of the engine. That said, it's quick and clever for a small box card game... and I primarily bought it more for playing the expansion when it comes out.

This is a very small box game, featuring multi-use cards which can represent goods, buildings or common central resources depending on where the card is and how you use it. The game encourages you to build these cool production chains, although in reality the game is usually over the turn before you would have made that one really big cool move. I like how the cards cycle around, so you really do see a lot of cards over the course of the game, but the anti-climatic build up keeps this game from being great. The expansions add some interesting elements such as new buildings, and playing through a story mode. I don't know if this makes up for the boom and bust feeling of the game.

Oh My Goods! (from the designer of Port Royal) was terribly disappointing. It does a similar trick of mixing a bit of push-your-luck with some light engine-building but then adds a dollop of Le Havre-style resource-conversion and removes any trace of interaction. I played a 4p game and I can't remember who two of the other players were.

Nice idea! In a 4 player game there are not enough cards in the pile to have a smooth play - you have to shuffle to often. We use tokens to indicate the number of goods on the buildings.

Unless talking ingenious use of cards to make a full fledged Euro. Not boring but not exciting. Will play again for me it is fun to see engine run at the end.

wasn't all that great with my gamer friends. playing this with my wife, however, it's much better. that may be in part due to the designer's rule changes which now allow you to dump a hand of cards and draw new ones. suddenly you can plan a strategy around that (for instance) cow you got early rather than instantly trade it away. there's a chance you'll find what you need in the next hand of cards rather than slowly drawing and regretting. can't wait to play the "fable" expansion!!

Loving this for solo so far but I keep discovering new rules/ways I have been playing wrong. My copy of the rulebook is the older Lookout Games ruleset which didn't include all the corrections and clarifications in the one I downloaded from Mayfair Games. One of these days I'll have it all straightened out. :P

Pros
- Fast set-up and tear-down
- Simple rules with in-depth decision-making
- Clean card design - easy to find and read pertinent information
- Pleasant artwork
- Clever card design - each card can be used in multiple ways and interpreted differently based on context
- Small, compact game - great for travel
- The edges of the cards are all white with a white core so they won't get any noticeable nicks on the edges if you do not sleeve

Cons
- Updated ruleset isn't included in my printing of the game and if I try to print it out from a home printer it will require a fair amount of effort to get it to fit in the box
- Rulebook could have been designed better for more clarity
- Not enough room left in the box for sleeving the cards of you prefer sleeves

Waargh. This game has so much potential which it can't hold. The whole production chain concept doesn't work properly: It's rare to use a product as resource of a product chain, where it would be theoretically possible to produce a product which needed a product, which needed a product. 
Thus half of the cards are unnecessary and block your deck. (Still they serve well as resource.) 

There has been some change to the rules, but in my opinion the game gets worse. So the rating is due to the old rules.

RATING: 7
It sounds a bit hard, especially considering my son really enjoys this one, but to me the game feels just a tad underdeveloped. Something that (like the excellent expansion for Port Royal), a well designed and tested expansion could improve on. There's a lovely risk, reward, planning, race game here, but with one build per turn it feels slightly too scripted, and with many similar cards it feels like you have too many good options. I compare it to San Juan (2nd edition), where there's the dilemma between building something cheap, or waiting and building something that you want more. Here you're looking to do the same, but the game is over so fast (with eight buildings), that you tend to build what you can and what might get you an Assistant, which is usually the couple of points difference between players at the end of the game. Early plays and it felt like the decisions were a little too obvious, but further play has seen a few more production chain ideas worth taking a risk on. Still, usually there's not a lot of waiting around to build ideal production chains over just what's available at the time.

(At a guess), I'd have thought more expensive buildings, or if multiple builds were allowed on a turn, with some more variation with the cards it would raise this a notch above good to very good.

Plays well with any player count, but interaction is limited to grabbing assistants before your opponents. Plays quickly with no waiting and lasts about 20 minutes. A rather satisfying 20 minutes at that.

As is it's a nifty little game in a small box -one I'll gladly take along with Port Royal and San Juan in my carry on bag. 

Update: 2nd Edition rules are a significant improvement with respect to planning. Playing to ten buildings results in a more rewarding game.

RATING: 6
Oh My Goods! is a resource conversion game in which cards perform triple duties as buildings, resources and currency. Players push their luck each round to see if the building of their choice generates money, which in turn is used to construct more buildings.

The allure of the game is that it offers a relatively deep gameplay experience in a compact package, both physically and time-wise. It does capture the essence of larger resource production-and-conversion games, although at the expense of unique characteristics for resources and buildings. Of course, it is very possible for luck to quickly snowball and create a runaway victor (or loser), but a brisk playing time of under 40 minutes [i]kind of[/i] compensates for that shortcoming. 

Still, there are other drawbacks which are more difficult to justify. For one, the race aspect favours cheap builds and renders expensive buildings pointless beyond the VP they provide. The amount of shuffling required here is also surprisingly tiresome. Maybe OMG! would have benefited from a longer development period –  which is hinted at with the rules revision in the second edition – but it otherwise satisfies a narrow niche in gaming.

Aldie recommended this to me around the time that the original came out, and I finally got around to purchasing a copy. It's really quite good. I like how the cards have a bunch of different options. There is definitely a press-your-luck mechanic here and being lucky does help. However, selecting which buildings to construct and creating chains definitely requires some skill, and effective play does balance going after getting an assistant, building the buildings that you can build, or creating effective chains. A really nice card-only game and I like how fast it plays.

This is a really cool design, a fun take on the multi-use card idea. The production chain stuff, where you can feed factory output (along with stuff from your hand) into a different factory is neat! However, it seems to be highly dependent on early game luck of the draw. If the initial displays and deal allow you to generate some income, you can build the right factories and ramp up your income generation ... the rich get richer. Fortunately, it is supposed to be a short game (although ours took nearly an hour)! 

In this game, I was able to set up a nice chain of 3 factories that fed into each other (I think it was the char burner, mill, and bakery). But then I couldn't draw or see the cards I needed to run them! I would like to try this again, hopefully with just 3 players (4 seemed to take a bit too much time between turns, and there was an awful lot of card shuffling).

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Everyone starts with a unique factory, with several face down cards representing charcoal, and a hand of cards. Each round, players earn 2 cards in income. Then, man a factory (everyone starts with one worker). In turn order, manned factories convert one type of good (possibly with something else) into another of greater value. Goods come either from your hand (all cards have an icon for a specific type of good) or from other factories. Factories also have a "production chain" icon; add the required resources (from your hand and/or other factories) to make additional goods. The starting factories are unique in the resource requirements to chain production. After running your factor(ies), you can spend resources to build a new factory (you chose one from your hand at then start of the turn, played it face down). You can also buy a card from display (set up randomly at start of game). These are extra workers, which you can use on future turns to man another factory; they have specific requirements for which types of factories you already have. 

The game ends the round after the round in which a player has built their 7th factory. Then, tally VP (from factories built and workers acquired). Most VP wins!

My expectations were too high after being told it was better than Port Royal. Oh no it's not! Solitaire efficiency game with some similarities to PR (use of cards as money, limited push your luck). But with PR I am playing against and with the other gamers, here you have very little interest in what othrs are doing. The game is clever in that it packs in s lot to a deck of cards and it takes some clever planning to pull off the final goods conversions. Soulless and could be played solitaire with (virtually) no difference to the game experience.

tl;dr: [thing=70149][/thing], the card game

Yep, take the resource generation element from Ora et Labora and turn that in to a card game, and that basically is what you get here. In the republished version, they even reused the artwork and resource types from that game, making it even more obvious.
I liked this game, but sometimes it was very frustrating as well. If the cards you need don't come out, there's little you can do to solve that problem.
But it's enjoyable.

Royal Goods was a pleasant surprise. A decent little engine building game, with a mild (but potentially significant) push your luck element. I'm a little concerned that some of the black cards are almost essential as your first play (the extra card option being massively powerful), but I'm delighted by how much game and how little downtime there is in a deck of cards.

Honestly, an absolute delight.

The solitairiest multi-player solitaire game I've ever played. Not a single decision you make has any impact on your opponents' plans (except maybe which assistants you work toward, which could be incidental). 

It's a Rosenbergesque operational efficiency puzzle distilled down to a 30-minute filler, which puts it in that awkward category of "Gamers' Filler": games too light for heavy gamers, and too complex for non-gamers. 

Your ability to build usable production chains is totally up to the draw of the cards, so it can be frustrating, but being able to pull off a mega-turn for the final turn is kind of satisfying.

If you're buying this to be a gamer's filler, the base game at under $15 is a pretty good money-to-game value.

A euro-style card game with a decent dose of luck. I've played this game twice without expansions, and 13 times with. Without the expansion, I'd categorize this as 'It Had Potential.' Theres a lot to like, where you build production buildings and set up supply chains - got coal and ore? You can make metal tools! Got Glass and Wood? You can make Windows! But the promised productivity never gets a chance to materialize - it's just hard to get any production chain really going. If you are competing, it's just best to buy buildings every round to run the clock out. I dunno, maybe I'm overjudging after 2 standalone games. The expansion, Longsdale in Revolt,helps steer you in the right direction, and gives you a cool little story mode as well. So if you get this, get the expansion. But, it's cheap, it's portable, and if you are with at least another gamer (who can deal with difficulty in figuring out the rules) then go for it!

I was very pleasantly surprised by Royal Goods after picking it up at the 2015 Essen fair. This is a sold, fairly deep card game in which a random number of goods become available to everyone each turn. Players are constructing buildings in hopes of converting these goods into money, allowing them to buy every larger buildings worth more points. The mechanics are smooth and clever and lead to a lot of tough choices (although there will be numerous rounds where the available goods simply do not allow certain players to accomplish much. If players get their production engines started at about the same time, the game is general close and tense. There is the possibility that the available good benefit one player's initial buildings much earlier and a runaway leader issue develops. However, the good far outweighs the bad here, and there's a lot of good game in this small card-game box.

Information glut on the multi-use cards is horrendously overwhelming, particularly for new players.  My view is that there's not much game under there and it's very dependent on luck of the draw. Nice attempt at incorporating a legacy-style narrative, at least.

I like it a lot in the first 2 games, but when we play it in 4 we come in a deadlock cause the deck was poor of cards, and we have a lot of card-resources under our buildings. So i wanna try again in 4 with a pool of card taken out of the game to use as resources. And maybe my score will be higher

RATING: 7
Oh My Goods had been on my radar vaguely. I knew it was a lighter card game that sounded interesting, but I don't always enjoy games by Alexander Pfister. So I was interested in trying it, but I wasn't seeking it out.

OMG is a game where the cards are multiple use. They are both things to build, resources to spend and goods/money to use. Generally, I really love games where cards can be used for multiple purposes as I enjoy trying to figure out how to best use what you've been given out of a lot of different possibilities.

In OMG, every round there will be a market of cards that everyone will share as virtual resources. There'll be two sets of market cards, the morning market and the afternoon market. The only difference in these is that you get to see the morning market before you decide how to play your turn.

The structure of a turn is that first you can discard all your cards to redraw a new hand (of the same size) and then you get another two cards. Then you see the morning market. You allocate your worker and decide if they'll work "strong" or "sloppy" and you put up a card that you'll try to build on your turn. Then you'll see the afternoon market. Then in turn order, each player's allocated worker tries to work at their selected building(s). And then you build your building (if you can afford to) and hire an assistant (if you qualify/can afford to). At the end of the game all your buildings and assistants are worth points.

Players have a starting building that requires some inputs to generate goods. They also have one worker who can choose to try and produce two goods by "working strong" which requires that the building be fully fed all the appropriate inputs, or who can try to "work sloppy" which allows the building to produce a single good but allows the good to be produced if you're missing one input. If the resources you need to run your building are in the market, then you use those resources. If there aren't sufficient resources in the market, you can spend cards from your hand to make up the difference.

When a building produces, it generates a good card (or two) which is put on the building and is now whatever good type that building produces and is worth the coin amount shown on the card. Additionally buildings that produce can also "chain" by feeding them additional resources of the appropriate type (as many as you can afford). For every resource you spend, you get to put another good on that card.

Goods can be spent in a couple of ways. First, if another building has that good as a chaining good, then you can use it to feed that building. Second, you can spend goods for the coin value on the building card they're on to purchase the building you put up this round or an assistant. If you don't use a good for any other purpose then they convert to their gold value and are worth a point for five gold at the end of the game.

Assistants are additonal workers that you can hire if you've built the appropriate matching buildings shown on their card and pay the appropriate coin cost. They are assigned to a building and only "work stong"... and they only generate a single good when working. Moving them to another card requires paying two coins.

This is an interesting game. I liked a lot of things about it. There is a luck element in the game. In the market phases you keep adding cards until you see two cards that are marked with a sun. Since over half the cards have suns, it's not uncommon to have small morning and afternoon markets. Which means that it's hard to run your buildings without either having those cards in hand (and it is painful to spend cards as they are a dear resource) or get lucky with the cards that showed up in the market. An early lucky break letting you get the ball rolling can end up turning into a decisive lead.

Additionally, if someone gets an early leg up, they'll be able to get assistants before other players, which lets them man more buildings, giving them a better chance of producing. Which seems like a "rich get richer" type of problem.

I did enjoy the game a lot, but I wonder if it maybe needs some tweaking. It feels like someone getting a lucky early break will have a huge advantage. There's too much game here to really be comfortable with it being decided (or at least largely so) by luck in the opening.

Surpreendente como um jogo apenas de cartas pode ser tão bom, contendo tantas boas mecânicas e estratégicas. Ele tem todo um jeito, um feeling de jogo "grande", de jogo euro, por sua dinâmica e, principalmente, por sua temática. É, de fato, bastante dependente da sorte, mas com o mérito de ser justo nessa dependência, com mecânicas que priorizam a estratégia, fazendo a sorte ser apenas um toque especial. Um pequeno JOGÃO.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting little diversion that plays up to 4p. The engine building mechanic is neat, as is the tried and trued multi-use cards. Unfortunately, the game feels a bit too fast to really get an engine going (even more so than another Race for the Galaxy, another tableau/engine building card game), so it feels like building is the dominant strategy. The randomness of the resource flip is also a bit unbalanced.

Still worth playing (a good light/medium filler).

This is basically Race for the Galaxy set in one of Uwe Rosenberg's harvest games. It's all about setting up resource conversion chains, turning basic items into more and more valuable composites. All pretty standard stuff, except in this game there is a push your luck element. All of a player's resources come out of a community pool, which is randomly determined both in size and scope every turn.

In other words, this is also a push your luck or speculation game. You have to guess whether or not you will have the required raw materials to make anything and often, you won't get to do anything at all if you come up short on supplies.

Having a random push your luck mechanic in what is largely a planning game is a bit strange, so I get why some people don't like it. I am not of the same opinion, I think it is quite fun, especially when played with the new 2nd edition rules. The new rules add a ton of card cycling, essential for those who prefer more control than the original rules provided.

The new name however, is ridiculously stupid. I can't for the life of me figure out why Royal Goods was a worse name than what we ended up with.

At first play, I adored this game, especially on seeing the first cycle of the deck and the potential combo opportunities. As it happens, real opportunities are far too rare, even when players agree to attempt production chains rather than random builds. The cards simply just don't turn up often enough, either in the initial random hand draw or in the market goods draws. Restrictions on engines don't provide any real way of gaining cards and the single provided way of attaining additional cards in hand is disingenuous in both the original rules and the revised ones. Ultimately the most efficient path to victory is a cheap build-rush and it will win every time. 

There are some basic solutions to this - initial primary manufacturing buildings needed to fire from almost any good or indeed any good (similar to the Window maker), or cards needed to have combinations of two goods, either doubles or two different goods... but we realised this two, maybe three plays in, and I'm left wondering, if it only took a mere three plays for us to be frustrated with the game and think up simple solutions, why wasn't it caught in playtesting? I'm tired of paying to playtest. This game could have been massive, it could have been an immensely clever, sharp, super dynamic engine builder but instead it's just a race to the end of the game. I'm more disappointed by such wasted potential, it really could have been great.

For its size this is a pretty complex resource conversion game. Unfortunately the luck of the draw can make or break the game and often you can't do anything about it. It overstays its welcome after some time - it's just a tad too long for what it offers. 

The major drawback is the fact that the game teases you with this grand machine of production synergies when in fact it's probably never going to happen - you won't have time nor resources to get your engine going.

Looks great and so much game in a small box - possibly the most I have seen in that small a box.  Artwork is good and game plays really well.

Production builder card game. Take a variable starting role and a charcoal plant needing random activation resources.  Several unique elements. Rounds cycle through deck fasts to mitigate "mana hose". Draw a hand with an option to discard and redraw.  Use multi use cards face down to represent goods. Cards can be used for their resource or played as a building. Buildings can only be activated with the Player card and/or assistant. The trick is to get production chains using resources from hand or other building.  Distinctive play comes from a push-your-luck planning to work carefully or carelessly based on what comes up in the morning market.  One downside is virtually no interaction. Don't know why this isn't considered 1-4 player count. This is essentially a solitaire game, but faster not having to wait for your turn.

RATING: 7
Totally solid card-based engine builder, where you're creating buildings that produce resources and then pushing your luck to get market cards that help you chain production and build more buildings. Made sense once I got into it, and I realize how I'd play subsequently.

Nothing really wrong with the game, but I don't feel it's particularly new or innovative. Theme is also fairly dry, as is the art.

Nice, quick, engine building game. Concerned that there is very little (almost none) player interaction. Despite this Oh my Goods! is a fun card game; the mechanisms have enough interlocking bits that every decision affects the final outcome, keeping it interesting despite the lack of interaction. For example, chain in too many cards too early and you limit your ability to produce later, and you also need to be slowly building up goods to chain in the end of you want to compete for the win. Interaction is essentially limited to watching how far the other players are from triggering the end of the game and making decisions about whether to hold back and work on your production and be more careful in crafting an engine or forge ahead and build small buildings to end the game. The luck of the draw is big though, with it determining what engine you can build and what goods you have available to chain in to your production.

GAME: Fireball Island
RANK: 2358

RATING: 4
Fun roll and move for one play. That was enough for me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Sure, it's not much more than a dice-roll-and-move game and it's tough to find a copy with all of the pieces intact, but who doesn't love rolling fireballs at your opponents? Plus, the game board is AWESOME! Unfortunately, it is so big we have to store it away from our game shelf, in a closet, but wow, what a great board. 

It has loads of player interaction. Games rarely take over an hour, I estimate it at 15 minutes per player for game time. Really not bad at all for a light game, but just enough strategy with the cards and board map that prevents it from being determined completely by the dice. Still one of my all-time favorites.

This game is seriously cool! Fully 3D board with Indiana Jones-esque player figures, all trying to get that big red jewel and off the island. Nice roll and move race type game with some freedom of movement and some ways to really screw the other players. The game does a good job of keeping all the players together and the race is always really close and tense to the end. The coolest kid's game I've ever seen!

My first board game! I absolutely loved this game as a child. I used to draw pictures about it during class at school. I just recently played it with some good friends and found that I can still enjoy it quite a bit. It's not one that I would play with just anyone though... it takes the right sort of attitude.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
this game never fails to bore me and my friends. it has this creesy, Indiana jones vibe to it, and the tension is real in this one. the cards offer so much excitement and can be combined in the most surprising, sometimes nasty ways. example: "fireball card", "I cancel that card", "I cancel your cancel card" etc. I find the cards the best part of the game. cards are way more important than the influence of the dice roll.

you can chose your path around the island which offers an element of strategy, which is very original. in most of these boardgames there is only one path but not so in this one.

the game is way overpriced on ebay, but there's a reason for it. people want this game. why? it's really fun and is a guaranteed hit among friends, with a couple pints of beer. what other game offers the same elements as this game, with the card play and multiple routes? I don't know many.

OMG... I saw this on a geeklist and it brings back memories. I remember playing this game and LOVING it as a child. It's buried in the basement somewhere. It really reminds me that I was a gamer as a child. 

Other games we played as children that have kitchy pieces: Battleship (not sure why I was so entralled with it) and Mousetrap (the ultimate in cheesy "let's make a game with lots of pieces for no reason and make it work cool").

I'm a total sucker for this game, which is really only marginal, at best.  In fact, the whole first half of the game is kind of pointless... but that last half in which the gem keeps trading hands can be great fun *with the right players.*

A fun children's game because of the unique board, but really just a roll and move game.  This is a fun game to play with the grade school kids, but I think that there are more interesting games out there.  Because of its size, it's a pain to store and ship.

The beginning and middle of the game are a waste of time, but the ending with the running back and forth as everyone tries to steal the jewel and make it to the boat before anyone else can steal it is pretty fun. 

Also, rolling the fireballs is fun.

Bought this one as a kid with my own pocket money.
Back then it set me back about 40 D-Mark, which was a lot to my younger self, but I really wanted this game.
And I don't regret getting it because it is tons of fun, plays well with adults and kids at the same time and is one of the most beautiful board games I have ever seen.

Likes: The physical rolling of the fireball marble destroying objects and trampling explorers was just awesome. Childhood nostalgia vibrant here.

Dislikes: Your movement is still mostly decided by roll of the die.

This is a game from my youth.  It was amazing.  Since then, many great games have come out but I still like this game.

It was different, fun and (when I was younger) the 3D board was just plain awesome.  Still is.

I still own the game and all the components.  
It's not a game I will choose to play with my friends now, but it is a game I will play with the kids to introduce them into the world of gaming.

It is still a fun family game.

This game is based on a race to the top of a mountain to achieve a coveted gem. You then take the gem to the dock to escape. You have a action hand, dice roll movement, jumping through caves and a great fireball that rolls down walking paths.
The reason i don't rate this higher, is because a game flaw. You can avoid the gem at the beginning and sit at the dock to take it from others. They in turn wait for the fake jewel card to move pass you and claim their reward.
Very entertaining for children

Have always been enamored by the DDD layout.

One of my friends brought this over yesterday.  I remember seeing ads for it when I was a teenager, but I was more into D&D at the time.

It's a roll and move, but there are cards you can play that elevate it slightly above other games with that mechanic.

It was fun and I'd play it again on occasion.

While nostalgia probably influences my rating a bit, this game was really one of the best roll-and-move games that I remember. The board was super-colorful, molded, 3D, and you could shoot fireballs at each other while everyone scrambled to escape the island. Rickety bridges and dangerous paths through the jungle where very few places were actually safe. Probably the only downside was that the board was huge, so it was slightly painful to store. But it was definitely a fun game!

2017-04-23 : It's one of those grail games, so when I got a chance to play it, that was a no-brainer. And just because it's such a grail game, I fully expected the game itself being not all that great. But I was wrong, For a roll-and-move take-that game it's surprisingly tactical and I was also very pleased with how clever the fireball paths were all engineered. The cave system means you're never really out of the game, which keeps it entertaining. Overall a very pleasurable experience.

Great game from my childhood.  While nostalgia artificially inflates its rating, there is no denying the cool factor of the board and being able to fireball players saying, "Please don't!... please?"  

More than a roll and move game, the first half is about getting the jewel atop the island.  This is the most fun.  After there is a foot race to the docks, in hopes of catching the player with the jewel. The bridges make for a nice little catch up to make it competitive, but this portion of the game does feel more of a roll and move mechanic.

I have fond memories of playing this game when I was a kid, so we pulled it out recently to see if it holds up over time.  It sure does, this game is a lot of fun to play.  You have move your treasure hunter around the beaitful 3D map to get the Jewel by the mountain.  All this while being nailed with fireballs and trying to beat your opponents, because once you have the jewel everyone is going to try and steal it from you!

Better then most random 1980s MB throw-and-go games for children, Fireball Island earns a place in my heart because it was _the_ game any kid from those times begged for during birthdays and Christmas time.  As for myself and lots of others, we always KNEW somebody who owned it, but never had it ourselves.  It doesn't create much tension with 2 players, but with 4 it is quite a heart-pounding riot!

RATING: 8.5
This is probably one of the best move and roll games ever made.

The board is cleverly designed to allow screwage of the leader - via the five fireballs, one located in VulKar's idol at the very top of the three dimensional game board.

Fireball Island has 'press your luck' caves that can be chosen instead of the perscribed paths to victory.

This game also contains special effect cards that can be obtained by selecting a path direction that lands your explorer on a dark space - you have a choice of paths and directions to take after each roll.

These cards can be played both in and out of turn, and by multiple players to counter other player card plays.

The final run of the game board is specifically designed to slow the leaders down. By clever use of path space colors, three dimentional bridges, and fireball paths.

I've played this game with ages 7-50 and each and every player has had a blast, especially the youngest players.

The game allows for 2-4 players but if you can find or make similar 'explorer' pawns, there is no reason that 5 or 6 can't be accomodated with no loss of fun and with even closer results. A recent 5 player game that we played had all five player pawns on the very last 5 spaces of the game board. You can't get any closer than that. ;)

RATING: 3
As a child, this game was my introduction to disappointment.  With its massive box, lavish 3D board and intricate components, how could it be a dud?  

Alas, it was.  It was a huge game, but it was so very, very dull to play.  It's basically Snakes and Ladders as you roll to move and randomly get sent back or forward.  Even the board was a disappointment, as the artwork was ugly and blurry compared to the photos on the box.   There was, however, a brief moment of excitement if the "fireball" hit the little plastic bridge while your pawn was crossing it, sending him into the waters below.

RATING: 5.5
This game's only appeal is nostalgia and the kinetic thrill of the fireballs.  Unfortunately, it takes far too long for what it is.  Next time my kids rope me into playing, we'll try a d8 or d10, or maybe 2d6 or 2d8 and choose which result to use, so fireballs become a tactical choice instead of only dumb luck.  If that doesn't help, it may go to ebay so I never have to play it again.  For now, I'll consider a trade/sell offer if the price is right...
UPDATE: 2d6 helped a bit, but not enough.  Try 2d8 next time...

This is probably one of  the greatest and most famous boards in BG history. His components made his celebrity all over the years, and we all loved it when we were kids.

Now a game at FI sees too much luck directed, while a 4 players game becomes interesting when using cards during other players' turn. The same happens when you have to launch fireballs to get your opponents...aside for the luck factor, the game is still a good family entertainment.

The first wave was a self-contained commissary loaded with Doritos and Orange Crush, but it was determined that diabetes was "taking too long."

The second wave was a shipping container filled with assorted "cargo", mostly ridiculous plaid coats and smallpox blankets.

The third wave broke upon these shores this very morning in the form of mercenaries merrily "gettin' some" from the open door of the helicopter gunship.

The smoke has cleared, all that can bleed are done, and we stride the beach in moral shadow... soon to learn the awful truth about "dead" religions.

RATING: 7
Don't be fooled, Fireball Island is far more cutthroat and devious than just a simple kids game. Easy to play, but hard to finish unscathed, this game is good for any audience who appreciates adventure... or good ol' fashioned ruthless rivalry.  The Island god Vul-kar reigns thunderous terror down upon the explorers in the form of multiple fireballs burning through the jungle landscape and crushing everything in their path. Soon the twinkle of the precious jewel coupled with the prospect of making a clean escape from the horrific island, where many have fallen in the past, inspires true villainy among the players who throw down all manner of cards to delay, deceive, and steal from one another.  A true innovation in its day, the 3 dimensional board with all its rickety bridges, stone stairs, mountain tunnels features terrain full of memorable artwork including valleys, cliffs, vines, skeletons, snakes, waterfalls, a river, and so on. A treasure in any board game collection, I was fortunate to find a copy in excellent condition on eBay.  I had to pay handsomely for it, but it really has been worth it. I have played with family and friends again and again, each time with plenty shady moves among players and laughs throughout as the game does a good job of keeping each player within reach of the lead. I am certain that I don't have another game quite like this one. It does take up quite a bit of room on the shelf and can suffer from laggy gameplay when players double back on the path, but the marathon type of gameplay that results makes victory that much sweeter and defeat that much more heartbreaking. Definite recommend.

Don't know how this one escaped me as a kid, but heard nothing but excitement and nostalgia love for this MASSIVE game. Waited three years before I was able to find a copy on ebay for under $100 (minus original player pawns which I replaced with painted pawns from The Adventurers). Playing it now, I'm in heaven. Rolling plastic marbles down the alleys towards your opponents has never been so awesome. The cards also add an element of surprise and luck.If you can find it and you have the space- buy it.

A fun family roll-and-move game with hand management whose three dimensions bring the game to life in a way almost every 2D game can't.  Grab the jewel and try to be the first to escape the island without getting hit by a fireball.  There is a lot of back and forth play, and a lot of interesting results given that the die is master.   That's it.  Expect more and you'll be disappointed.

Great production value and undeniable toy quality, but the game doesn't hold up very well after so much time.

A game with fond memories from my childhood. It does not completely hold up over time - like the roll and move mechanism, or the fireballs on a roll of a 1 on a d6 became quite annoying at times.

Decent roll and move game with some tactical play depending on the cards you are holding.
Luck is a huge factor too but that's okay with this sort of game.

the box is surprisingly light. If there is a little breeze the game will fly away...

i found this pretty cheap and allthough I had to drive to the other side of Belgium it was definately worth the effort.

I own the dutch version but language dependency is low.

edit: out of the collection for a while. Rerating it simce i am imtrigued with the new edition.

I have always been fascinated by this game when I was a kid and I never got a chance to play until recently.

It's basically an improved roll and move game that has some actions that allows to dodge bad luck. There seems to be multiple path to reach certain destination, but in general players still seem to go around the board. I would have loved to have more flexibility.

The components are very surprising, and it's just fun to push the fireball and see that it will do. Still, I don't think the dexterity element is that interesting.

The only bug I found so far is near the end of the game, players can constantly steal each other's jewel. So the jewel jumps from a player to another and that is just annoying and boring.

Personally, I would have added one time use equipment cards that you could acquire at the beginning of the game, but I think the game is too simple to allow cards with special powers.

I never had this game as a kid, but picked it up on E-Bay as an adult...  I still think it's a very cool game... Played a 4-player game with friends and they hated it... thought the game could go on FOREVER because everyone was keeping each other from getting up the mountain to the jewel by using their cards and rolling fireballs all the time!!  The game isn't quite so "hard-core" when you are playing with kids.  In fact, the game works quite nicely with 2 or 3 players...

Ya gotta love the 3-D board and the rolling of the "FireBalls"!!!  This game is probably the best boardgame translation of an Indiana Jones adventure...  "Curse of the Idol" looks really cool, but isn't a very good game when it comes down to it...  "Fireball Island" really is a neat little game that should still be made to this day!!  Maybe someday we could see an update... HELLO???   Milton Bradley... HASBRO???

This was perhaps my most-anticipated Christmas gift ever. I was 7 or 8 when I got it. I think I saw commercials for it on TV, or else I played it at a friend's house. I loved the red marbles that you rolled out of the big stone head for fireballs and the 3D plastic board. The crystal was so cool that I wanted to win just to hold onto it. I also loved the way the fireballs could actually collapse the bridges. I think this game may have begun my love affair with miniatures.

I didn't play this game as a kid but I vaguely remember the TV advertising for the game.  So it doesn't store special nostalgiac value for me.  I am not sure it is as good a design as most people believe... but the molded plastic board is quite attractive and the box artwork would have most boys and girls excited about the game. 

Ok - I tried this again and I definitely can see the appeal.  Especially for a five year old.  The game is fun even if you get knocked down a few times.  The cards provide a great mix of special options.  A great game I am happy to own.

RATING: 4.5
A roll-and-move, pick-up steal, steal, steal and deliver game that wouldn't amount to much if not for the cool theme, awesome 3D board and the rolling marble fireball mechanic.

The play can be quite frustrating as it's a heavy bash-the-leader game.  Players will be fireballed many times and receive tons of take-that cards.  It's certainly better to give than receive on Fireball Island.

The components are the thing.  It's just a roll and move game, but you can push little red marbles down little plastic hills and knock little plastic people over into little plastic gullies and stuff.  If you like little plastic bits, this game's for you.  Glad I got it in trade - not worth $100 to buy and have it shipped.

A roll and move game where you take shelter in the caves and other players try to fireball you from the top of the volcano. If they do; back to the beginning and lose a turn!

For Trade/Sale (local/convention only, I will not ship this*)

Condition: Ask for details (serious inquiries only)
some missing parts, box is in very poor condition, game board is in very good condition, bridges are fully intact, deck is "worn".  Overall the game is still absolutely playable.

* Due to the condition, size and rarity of this item I will not ship it.  I would want the buyer/trader to see the item and ensure that they are happy with the condition before finalizing any deals.

RATING: 6.5
Holy Moly! This is one very Ameritrash game of pure fireball mayhem. The game box is huge and there is nothing but pure unadulterated fun showing on that box. When you open up the box the game board fits exactly to the size of the box and it is raised with peaks and valleys. In the center of the game board sits Vul-Kar the mighty fire-breathing volcano god.

This is all very impressive. But all in all, this is really a very simple roll and move game. The beauty of the game comes from the fireballs and the choices you will make as an adventurer as to where you will send the fireball. There are valleys on the board, that upon a first play you might not realize that you could send a fireball to topple a bridge that some hapless player was standing on. Sometimes a fireball will have a benefit, by placing a player in a rubbish pit closer to the gem. 

Only one adventurer will be able to leave the island. The end game is stealing the gem back and forth from player to player...fireballs flying and hitting everyone sending you all back to the rubbish pit. Only to have the race to the tiny boat continue again and again until one brave and triumphant soul makes it to that boat and hastily makes his get away...leaving all other adventurers to their doom on Fireball Island.

Is this game a must have? Probably not...but it is fun and probably shines best with it's maximum player complement. It however deserves a reprint and it would be well loved by a new generation.

This rating is purely the result of the joy I got out of this game as a kid. That box cover was such a bad ass mofo! Rolling those red marbles and incinerating my friends and family was such a treat!

RATING: 6.5
After playing this finally, I gave it a rating of 6.5.  Normally a roll and move game like this would be merely a 4-5, but the kitsch factor of the fireballs, the card play that you can use to screw around with your opponent, and the caves actually make this a bit more enjoyable.  I would believe this will be better with 3-4 players than 2.

RATING: 6
Yes, I'm all grown up now and still love this game. Why? because my dad played it with me when I was a kid. That is, when we BOTH were kids. He bought this game, presumably, to keep me entertained....but now I know the truth. He loved it as much as I did. 

Games like this, and me, helped him live his second childhood. From what I understand, his first one wasn't so great. As an adult, however, he had boardgames, role playing, and me. My Mom didn't like playing games much, and thought most of them were stupid and pointless. 

Dad's second wife, however, plays games with him. And now that I'm living with them for a while, I play games with them too.

What does all of this have to do with Fireball Island? Nothing, and everything. If you've played this game with your family, whether as a parent or a kid, you understand. You understand the laughter and the good times. It's an experience game, I guess, and if you haven't played it in just the right setting, you might not understand its simple joy.  

See...my dad chose to live his second childhood with me, and we played Fireball Island. So, we kinda grew up together, and his second childhood provided him the gaming buddy he always wanted. 

It's a great game, and serves as one of my litmus tests to detect people infected with TDSS (Too Damn Serious Syndrome). If someone can't enjoy a stupid random game like Fireball Island — can't temporarily let go of the pretentiousness and BS of the real world, then that probably makes them way too serious for me.

Very sad to have lost this game. I'd gotten it as a child and never gave it too much though, then on a silly whim, some friends got it out when we were in college and found that, despite it's obvious kid-friendly nature, the end-game usually became quite intense.

RATING: 6.5
Much of this rating is based, not on nostalgia (I only picked this up for the first time last year) but for its "fun factor". My 8 year-old daughter absolutely loves this game and so do I. The design of the board, with the dynamic of having the marble "fireballs" actually rolling into your player tokens ...not necessarily knocking them off, either...is delicious. Steep precipices, rickety bridges, an idol to capture, rival adventurers...all in a very tactile package that adults and kids alike can enjoy. 

A shame they don't reprint this...it's a pricey game to acquire. Recommended to all adventurers who can enjoy a quick game of nothing but fun.

7 (Nostalgia Goggles Score) - I bought this game at a yard sale as a kid because it was huge and had an angry demon volcano on the front spewing fireballs.  The game was everything it promised and more.  It was a huge, molded plastic island and you raced around collecting treasures and trying not to get hit by the fireballs (and hoping everyone else got hit by the fireballs).

A massive overproduced game from the late 80's which features "screw over your friends when they are about to win" cards ala zombies.

Grail game of the Oregon Trail generation, this overproduced masterpiece is a tediously mediocre roll-and-move game if you're an adult, or a glorious opportunity to set your parents on fire if you're a little kid and feel the height of hilarity is rolling actual fireballs that knock people down.  If you're considering paying the outrageous secondary market prices for this, I'd advice you to hold off unless you have young ones of your own that would enjoy the experience, as it will not be as fun for you as you imagined it would be back in elementary school.  If, on the other hand, you already have this because you thought to buy it cheaply before everyone else realized they were now adults with money, then don't let it collect dust and make a kid happy instead.

A roll and move type game with overproduced bits. The board is one large molded piece of plastic. There are nice marbles (fireballs) and other bits (boats, bridges, player figures, cards).

The game sees players trying to grab a gem and be the first to get off Fireball Island. There are event cards to use (alot of take that effects) and certain things trigger off Fireballs that players roll around the board to knock other players down (Heehee). Lots of bash the leader and overpowered special cards.

Good fun and works well with kids and adults too. One of the largest game boxes I have EVER seen.

I got alot of play out of this as a kid.  I have vague memories of solo play.  Never has a game been so over produced, a vacuum molded board, falling marbles that knock over bridges, cute details like skeletons and snakes hidden in the printing, it was execellent.  The game is a simple roll the die and move mechanic, theres short cuts with the caves that end you up in random locations and cards that effect the play.  It was a pretty fun spin on the roll and move genre of kids games.

This game is so much fun & there is a lot of strategy within the game! 

The cards play a vital role within the game, especially if you know the best opportunity to use them. For example, saving 1 or 2 Magic Talisman cards (if you happen to draw them en route to the jewel) because if you are not the first player to get to the jewel, you probably will get targeted with a Fireball because you are no doubt right behind the person whom took it! (They get 1 Fireball Action, 3 turns & up to 4 cards immediately after getting the jewel!)

Again, save your best cards if you have the jewel & are attempting to make it to the dock (Fake Jewel, Magic Talisman, Cancel Card) because everyone will be coming after you!

You get the cards if you land (not pass!) on any of the darker colored spaces on the island (which is about every 3 or 4 spaces usually!) Or, you may turn in Magic Charm token you picked up from Witchlords Step and get up to 4 cards also! The only perk for having the Magic Charm token is that you cannot have your cards stolen from you if you have the Magic Charm token & the Jewel.

Overall, it's a very fun game! I enjoy trying to race or sabotage an opponent when en route to the dock! It's very interesting, especially when playing with 4 players!

It’s an old Milton Bradley game with a 3-D mountainous board of molded plastic (another board that you’ve got to take a look at, just like Eselsrennen). Sadly I remembered the game being far better than it was. It’s basically a roll-and-move where the players race to pick up a gem and bring it to the end of the course. Once a player has picked up the gem though, other players can steal it by walking past him or her. This leads to a drawn-out end game as the gem is stolen back and a forth, and an obviously random winner as the last person to steal the gem at the end of the track is the lucky victor. It’s a very cool looking game and certainly fun when you roll a 1 and get to launch a fireball (i.e., red marble) down the course to knock over your opponents, sending them to the "smolder pit," but it’s certainly not worth the hefty prices that it’s fetching on eBay. ----- I have fond memories of playing this as a kid, and would love to find a copy of it, but the prices on eBay are simply ridiculous, there's no way it's worth that much, despite the coolness factor of a 3D board with lava marbles.

OK. So it is a kid's game that is basically about rolling and moving, with the ability to play cards to slow your opponent down and/or help your own movement.  But the appeal of the 3D board complete with fireballs (red marbles) to roll over your opponents was fun enough to play once.

Super cool production value, and I'm sure the nostalgia factor will be high for those who used to own this, but at its heart, this is just a roll and move, and thus, kind of sucks.

Previously owned, but got dumped after moving house. :( Loved it really very much. Easy to learn. Fast paced, with interesting interactions. Good blend of luck and courage. Always funny to see fireballs rolling over your rivals or sometimes yourself. Missed this hilarious 3D game. The experience is unique even the game idea is simple. A must-have if reprint will be available. Got a used copy through eBay.

This is a children's game at heart. The game is simple and luck based. While there are some simple strategies you can follow, the basic idea is to roll well and to try and be at the right place at the right time. While I have only logged 1 play, my initial impressions are positive. This is a game you play once in a while when you feel nostalgic.

RATING: 7
Good luck with little strategy.  Rolling the fireballs is such fun!  The 3-d look to the game adds to the attractiveness.  Downfall is its replay value.  This is a chase game basically all the way, and contains way too much luck than strategy.  This is one of those games where if they made it more complex, the value would&#039;ve gone up

RATING: 4
You can't beat the cool pieces.  Vul-kar is particularly neat, as are the marbles and the bridges.  The game itself is a children's take that game, with it all eventually coming down to luck at the end.  But for a half-hour distraction, particularly with family members, this is a great choice.  Love that molded plastic board.  This game proves that great children's games don't always come from Haba or Zoch, but that American publishers can do it too.

It's a miracle the board survived my childhood without being smashed but it helped that I prized it since I got it for my birthday.  I expose everyone I think is worthy of playing to Fireball Island!  It's always a hit.  The brilliance lies in the cards.  Bah, I could go on and on with positive things to say! Fireball Island is incredible!    Fireball!!!!!

Features Explorers at it again trying to obtain precious jewels from an Evil Idol. You'd think they had learned by now? lol Explorers need to make it through the treacherous mountain with an Evil Idol over looking their every move. But, watch out! Fireballs can come at you at anytime or even other Explorers greedy to take your precious jewel. Be the first brave Explorer to obtain the jewel and make it back to the dock to escape FIREBALL ISLAND!!!

I got this game and Torpedo Run one year for X-Mas... that was a great great Christmas.  This was such a fun game.  Not a great game but the board was really awesome.  I'd love to find a copy of this in good condition for old time sake.

The game which defined my childhood love for boardgames. It scales a ten at thematic gameplay.

Coolest gameboard ever created.  It's a roll & move game but is exceptionally fun.  

HUGE "screw you" factor with the cards, which is what makes this game truly shine.

Great 3-D action with lots of rolling marbles to knock out your opponents. Cool double task rules (capture the jewel first, then escape to the pier) as well as hot potato passing of the jewel back and forth, and multiple paths to get here and there spice it up. And isn't just plain awesome to roll one of those fireballs out the river chute so that it hits the rickity bridge?

8/14/13 - Rating 7:  Surprisingly fun despite its outwardly inane appearances.  Actually, you people might think it actually is inane, but I think it's good for a play or two from time to time.

P.S. all of my gamer friends think it's inane.

Played a very long time ago and a good impression remains... I remember the impressive diorama used to play, which transport the players in a sort of adventure by Indiana Jones!

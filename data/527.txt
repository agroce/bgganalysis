A great abstract strategy game that started an amazing series.  The simple push and match 4 mechanic of this game makes it accessible, with the GIPF piece (stack of 2) adding just enough complexity to make it strategic.

Adding the potentials from the expansion packs makes this game absolutely shine.  Each is so powerful and adds a completely new game mechanic that is ignored at a players peril.  

Good game on it's own, great game with the potentials.  For players of the other games, this game with the potentials is brilliant as you can see the mechanics and feel of the other games come into play.

I did not play this game as often as other games in the GIFT series. My usual opponent did not like it. But I enjoyed the few games I have played. From the aesthetic point of view, this is the least interesting of the series.

The base game is good, but a little plodding, and the endgame can seem like slow torture as one player slowly bleeds the other of his pieces.
Add potentials, and the game opens up tremendously and becomes really fun.

RATING: 8
Take connect four, make it possible to fire bits in from any side of a hexagon and add a Tetris style line completion/disappearance cycle and you have basic GIPF. 

I've not even played with potentials and this is already the most complex and obscure of the series.

Add a piece, push other pieces in its row, add a piece, push other pieces in its row, add a piece...Gipf seems plodding and attritional compared to other games in this series.  Perhaps it's just my rubbish standard of play, but it seems really difficult to set up captures without telegraphing what I'm doing.  The potentials add a bit of movement and some more to think about, which is welcome.

Production quality is pretty good, the board is the most spartan of the series, the rules are clearly written.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I lose badly to GF1 online (not so badly face to face), but I find GIPF to be one of those games that draws you back as you are kicking yourself for missing a simple play where the opponent grabs a bunch of your pieces.

I was intrigued about the whole GIPF project, but after a couple of plays of this, it hasn't really grabbed me as a basic abstract. I'm sure there's much more there, but perhaps not for me-- so traded away.

RATING: 6
Very straightforward rules wherein, once again, you try to get four in a row on the board, and once you do, you capture the opponents pieces that are also on that same line of the board.  You place pieces on the board by pushing pieces along a line starting from the edges.  The game ends when a player no longer has a piece to move. 

I like the game, though I don't love it.  On the other hand, GIPF has a certain easy and breezy quality to it that does feel distinguishable and distinct. It just might be the most accessible of the GIPF series, and that is worth something.  Children might even enjoy this one.  We did play the basic rules.

I am not too keen on this game.  Compared to Zertz it is lacking.  Compared to Abalone and it is very similar.  Not sure if I will play this one as much.

The first in the GIPF series.  A nice abstract game that tends to feel a bit odd in comparison to the stand-outs that follow.  Still a good game in its own right.  [GTI Code: APSD]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
An outstanding abstract game design that really shines in its ultimate incarnation.  The core game is a solid abstract that rewards study and smart play.  But when played with potentials, the game simply goes over the top.  The complexity level in terms of strategy and options is awesome.  Easily destined to be a classic in the abstract game genre.  

Rating is based more on Ultimate GIPF than base game.

Played the basic (standard?) game. Amazingly simple rules that make for a complex game. Not my kind of thing as I don't care for abstracts so much (which might be because I tend to suck at them) but a really cool game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This rating could potentially move to a 10, but I want to put a few more plays in first.  GIPF is an extremely intense abstract, as your pieces are your lifeline, and while you want to put your pieces on the board so that you have control and can capture your opponent's pieces, you also want to have some in reserve since you will lose if you can't make a play.

I love all the choices that GIPF presents in a very simple, tight rules package.  You can focus on just eliminating your rival's pieces, concentrate on getting their GIPF pieces off the board, create plays where you capture your own pieces so that you don't run out of moves, etc.

I'm quite surprised that I like GIPF this much, as I've played all the other games in the series and really didn't think anything could match DVONN, TZAAR, or YINSH.  If Kris Burm creates an eighth game in the series, I'm there.

Update: Subtracted three points from original score.  I just don't seem to get excited about playing this anymore.  It's more an endurance game than anything else.  A well-designed endurance game, but one lacking in creative and game-changing moves. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The namesake of the series and I have to say the weakest one of the GIPF project. Still like it as I am a big fan of abstract strategy but this is going to be the hardest one to get other people to play with me.

How a predecessor to so wonderful games can be so boring? Every other GIPF project game is brilliant! Just not this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is perhaps the most elegant of the GIPF project games, which fits nicely, due to the fact of being the first one (and, depending on how you see it, the "glue" relating them all).

The mechanics are almost as easy as, say, Checkers. However, there is a huge depth to this game. It isn't rated higher on my book simply due to the fact that I usually prefer something with more theme to it (see my Chess rating, for instance).

A very nice game, nevertheless, which I'm usually willing to play. A solid 7.

Similar in a way to Abalone in the pushing and shoving mechanism but much better since there's never a possibility of a stalemate. This is the key to all the GIPF-series game: inherent game progress each turn. For fans of abstract games, the entire GIPF-series is a must buy. The potentials really make GIPF shine.

Terrific abstract. Very dynamic; both players send in pieces from every direction. Meanwhile, you have to worry about trying to capture opposing pieces, preventing your opponent from capturing of your own, and making sure you will keep a steady supply of your own pieces coming back to you. Add the extra wrinkle of the gipf pieces on top of that -- can my opponent capture my gipf pieces? is it worth the risk of pulling one off in order to gain the two extra pieces in my reserve? -- and you have a game that puts the mind through a yoga workout.

A solid invitation to the GIPF Project for newer abstract gamers. A unique caveat is I've found smarter players when to view this entry as more of the "Checkers" of the series, and quickly seem to tired of its more plodding nature in favor of the rest of the series, where moves can occur anywhere on the board, at any time.

The first Gipf game and in my humble opinion one of the best. A bit longer than the others and not so much of an instant brain burner. Don´t get me wrong, it´s very deep, but not as instantly confusing as Yinsh or "backward planning" as Dvonn.

Yet another tricky game from Kris Burm.

Update rating from 8.5 to 7 from 2007 to January 2017. 
Revisited after many years. It is the weakest of the entire series. The tension isn't quite at the same level of the others in the series.
It's a long war of attrition until you've worn down your opponent.
Plus the components are the plainest of all the games (other than Tzaar).

Don't get me wrong, Gipf is still head and shoulders above most abstract games out there; just that compared to the other 7 Gipf games, it isn't top tier.

I have so many abstracts that I seldom play any one of them very deeply; this one and the rest of its GIPF Project offer so much depth that I'll never have time to explore all the options.

I admit that I only purchased this game because of a challenge I'm doing in another geeklist. I was pleasantly surprised by GIPF though. What is vaguely similar to tic-tac-toe morphed into a very enjoyable experience. I've only played this game once and honestly I'm not sure how often its going to get the table, but I enjoyed playing it.

Amazing abstract game-cum-game concept. Sadly, I don't get to play as much as I'd like, but every time I do I am impressed by GIPF's subtelty and textures, areas in which it scores big time over Chess or Go, and so is much more appealing to me. A challenging game that is not saddled by the "installed base" of most high end intellectual games, if I may call them that. I don't generally like abstracts, but I am a huge fan of this game and it's sister games (TAMSK, ZERTZ, and DVONN, and hopefully two more!).

Would rank it higher if I "get it."  

I have played several games PBW on boiteajuex.net and the PC GIPF program.  It is a beautifully designed, and deep game.

For me this game suffers from the oops I lost flaw. I like games that make me feel smart, not ones that make me feel stupid. Games that I look at and say I won because I did X, not I won because the other player failed to notice Y.

As an experiment, we played while constantly warning the other player about Y and the game never ended. We never even captured pieces! And to add to it, we just felt stupid because almost every turn we had to take back moves as we failed to fully comprehend the consequence of our choice.

That being said, I'm sure that for competent players, this game must be fantastic. There is so much to take into account, the possibilities with movement are incredible, the board states rife with opportunity.

Love this series. GIPF itself has some deep strategy, and it has the most variety when you include the expansions. Still, it doesn't grab me in the way ZERTZ, DVONN, and YINSH do. This might be more like a 7, but with so many good abstracts around I never feel like playing this.

While I like the Gipf-series games I don’t love them. The same is true for this game which started it all. But while I don’t love it, I still think it’s a very good two player abstract games (in general I’m not a huge fan of abstracts, so a 6.5 is pretty good). GIPF is so elegant! It’s a relatively quick GIPF project game, just like Tzaar (Yinsh is a good game, but I do think it can take just a little too long compared to Gipf/Tzaar or even Dvonn).

The two different ending conditions are great as you need to balance, and my first two plays have ended due to both conditions. I liked how you basically just need to get 4 in a row, but it’s so much deeper than this; you need to think a lot about how to push your pieces to form a row or how to push your own or your opponent’s pieces in order to destroy his or her plans! I really liked how you can permanently take out some pieces belonging to your opponent by clever play with 4 in a row if they are directly connected to your row.  I think you need to play it with the rules which includes the GIPF pieces for a much deeper game.

I was very underwhelmed by Gipf. I'm sure there is much, much more to learn and appreciate about the game, but I didn't feel that exhilaration that I got on my first plays of Tzaar, Yinsh, and even Dvonn - that feeling of exploring and experimenting with a very strange and nonintuitive dynamic. Gipf just... Well... It happened.

A good game but probably one of my least favorites from the GIPF series.  I would say, the weakest of the GIPF series.  It needs the potentials to spice it up a bit. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Without a doubt, one of my favorite theme concepts comes from this series. The core game is probably one of my least favorites in the series just because it's comparatively bland and a little harder to get my head around compared to Zertz, Dvonn, or Tamsk. On the other hand, the way that Gipf brings everything together is unprecedented and incredibly cool.

I have a homemade version, someday someone will want to learn this series with me and we will have a great time, until then I pull this out every once in a great while and try to teach my friends, but the game isn't really that intuitive so the first game they get slaughtered and then we pull out a Kosmos 2 player game.

I like that you win by eventually putting your opponent in a situation to exhaust his pieces without making a row. Initially, you are targetting his tokens in capture, but somewhere mid-game, you subtly switch to trying not to allow him any of his pieces back into his hand. Nice little play there.

I have not yet played with the potentials...but that has more to do with lack of opponents than anything else. I need to add Tamsk and Punct to complete my circle. I'm envisioning a major event where each of the preceding games is played, gathering Gipf pieces and various potentials...eventually culminating in a big monster Gipf game with all the various potentials that have been 'earned' from prior games.

I had my doubts about this one initially because of its simple premise - make rows of 4. Nothing too exciting there, I thought it would be like a simplified version of go. However, the motion mechanic is really mind-bending and this game holds its own among all of the gipf series in my opinion.

Date aproximative du texte: 2002

Gipf est le jeu central du projet éponyme de Kris Burm. La série complète doit compter six jeux différents.
Il se joue sur un plateau hexagonal, les disques noirs en périphérie sont considérés comme ne faisant pas partie de l’aire de jeu.

Le jeu de base
But du jeu: Capturer les pions de l’adversaire jusqu’à ce qu’il soit dans l’impossibilité d’en jouer.
Les joueurs jouent avec 15 pions sur les 18. Il est possible de jouer avec un handicap si les joueurs sont de force inégale. Le joueur le plus faible joue avec 16, 17 ou 18 pions.
Les blancs commencent, à son tour un joueur doit mettre en jeu un pion de sa réserve, pour cela il doit le poser sur un disque noir en périphérie et le glisser d’un segment vers le centre du plateau en suivant une des lignes.
  	
Si l’intersection est déjà occupée le pion (où les pions) sont poussés d’une intersection dans le sens du déplacement afin de libérer l’intersection. Mais attention il est interdit de rejeter un pion hors du jeu.
  	  	
Dés qu’il y a une série d’au moins quatre pions de couleur identique contigus et alignés, il faut les retirer du plateau. Si dans le prolongement de cet alignement il y a des pions adverses, ils sont capturés, si ce sont des pions amis ils retournent dans la réserve. Un intersection libre interrompt un alignement.
Si deux alignements sont crées en même temps, ils sont retirés tous les deux à moins qu’ils ne se croisent auquel cas le joueur choisit quel alignement il retire. Si les deux alignements sont de couleur différente, c’est le joueur dont c’est le tour qui retire son alignement et ses prisonniers en premier.
  	
  	
Le jeu standard

Les règles sont identiques mais, les joueurs utilisent en plus un autre type de pion , le pion Gipf qui est en fait deux pions classiques empilés.
Chaque joueur joue avec les 18 pions de sa couleur, les trois pions de la configurations de départ sont des pions Gipf et les 12 pions restants constituent la réserve.
But du jeu : Capturer les pions de l’adversaire jusqu’à ce qu’il soit dans l’impossibilité d’en jouer, ou capturer le dernier pion Gipf de l’adversaire
Les pions Gipf se jouent de la même manière que les pions classiques, simplement en cas d’alignement le joueur est libre de laisser sur le plateau les pions Gipf qu’ils soient à lui où à son adversaire.
Si un joueur reprend un de ses propres pions Gipf, celui ci redevient définitivement deux pions classiques.
Quand deux alignements se croisent sur un pion Gipf, le joueur décide s’il prélève une ou deux rangées, en effet il peut prendre une première rangée et laisser le pion Gipf de façon à ne pas interrompre le second alignement.

Le jeu de tournoi

Quelques changement par rapport au jeu standard :
Il n’y à pas de configuration de départ. Chaque joueur fait rentrer ses pions en jeu où il le souhaite.
Le premier pion joué doit être un pion Gipf.
Les joueurs décident d’utiliser le nombre de pions Gipf qu’ils veulent, ils doivent les introduire en premier avant les pions classiques. Dés qu’un joueur introduit un pion classique, il ne peut plus d’introduire de nouveaux pions Gipf.

Mon opinion

J’ai découvert Gipf après trois autres jeux du projet, il faut dire que je n’étais pas spécialement attiré par son matériel tristounet. En outre un survol rapide des règles m’a laissé une impression de jeu compliqué qui ne cadrais pas avec la simplicité de la prise en main des autres jeux du projet. Le jeu resta ainsi plusieurs mois en bas de l’étagère dans l’anonymat total jusqu’à ce que je le sorte après une série de parties de Dvonn, Tamsk et Zertz. 
Et c’est à ce moment que je me maudis de ne pas avoir plus tôt eu une once de curiosité…Le jeu est une perle, et chaque partie offre un excitant défi ludique. Certes le matériel reste terne, mais il est vite oublié devant l’intérêt du jeu et on ne peut lui reprocher finalement qu’une durée un peu longue et c’est tout. 
Une partie de Gipf est en tout point passionnante car pour bien la conduire il faut à la fois renforcer ses positions et surveiller sa réserve. Paradoxalement une forte position sur le plateau avec des pions nombreux signifie un dangereux rapprochement des conditions de défaite. La réserve est réellement le nerf de la guerre et la capture n’est pas un but en soi c’est simplement un moyen affaiblir l’adversaire. Très souvent il sera nécessaire d’abandonner une configuration intéressante en alignant un quatrième pion uniquement dans le but de renflouer sa réserve. Le jeu est extrement versatile, et une capture ressemble à un raz de marée tant elle modifie l’équilibre des forces. C’est une caractéristique fondamentale du jeu et elle a deux conséquences, la première c’est qu’une capture affaiblit momentanément l’attaquant qui doit retirer sa ligne d’attaque du plateau, le défenseur peut donc en profiter pour consolider ses positions. La seconde conséquence est l’impossibilité de construire une stratégie à long terme tant le plateau est changeant, il faut réfléchir à moyen terme et le jeu se fait davantage sur un travail de sape opiniâtre. Le fait que le rapport de force et la configuration de jeu soient fluctuants et ne résultent pas d’une construction continue gênera peut être les joueurs de go ou d’échec. D'ailleurs j'ai souvent l'impression qu'une partie de Gipf est une succéssion de problemes et la victoire peut se jouer sur le dernier tableau.
Je vous conseille de passer rapidement à la version standard du jeu, car les pions Gipfs modifient radicalement le jeu en introduisant à la fois un nouveau choix (retirer ou pas un de ses pions Gipf du jeu) et une faiblesse (en conserver au moins un pour ne pas perdre). Le jeu prend alors toute sa saveur et j'en redemande.
Gipf est une réussite, un jeu indispensable dans la gamme des jeux à deux. A quand la version de luxe ?

RATING: 7.1
I want to love Gipf. As the title game of the project that gave us Zertz, Yinsh, Tzaar and Dvonn, it carries the same weight of expectation of brilliance. I have only played the base game, but I find it very frustrating. The play is very cyclic in nature, as opposed to the four games mentioned, in which the board size decreases with every move, leading to a claustrophobic and exciting end game. In contrast, Gipf seems never to end! Pieces fly on and off the board continuously, strategy is hard to see, and the whole thing feels very pointless. I obviously need to study basic tactics to see how to capture my opponents pieces more often, but I'm not sure how much time I want to give this one. For a better example of cyclicality on a hex grid, see Mark Steere's Oust.

The strategy is difficult to grasp so far. It seems that you need to sacrifice a piece now and then to remove your opponent's forces from the board, leaving you to dominate it. But I'm not sure about that.

This is a somewhat curious game. On one hand, it has everything it needs to become a timeless classic, it has the depth on the level of Go or Chess, but on the other hand, I would probably always much rather play DVONN, TZAAR, YINSH or TAMSK than this. Perhaps this is exactly because it is so hard to play it even remotely well, and the strategy baffles the hell out of me.

I picked this up while looking for a second copy of Zertz to give to a friend. Having already played Zertz and Dvonn, my expectations of a subtle and deep game were high and I was at first a little disappointed. GIPF seems to take a bit more work to get into and demands deeper tactical play, but certainly rewards that effort. However I would still rate it slightly lower than bother Zertz and Dvonn

This is an interesting abstract puzzle game.  I haven't quite been able to wrap my head around the game and developing a strategy for it and that's using the basic rules without potentials.

The more GIPF series games I play, the more I like them all; this series of games convinced me to stop hating abstracts. This game is central to the GIPF experience; although I wouldn't necessarily start here (look at DVONN, YINSH, or TZAAR), if you find yourself playing and liking one or more of those, GIPF would be a great addition. I also like the idea of the potentials, although I've not played with them yet.

I love the whole series, and the others probably 'click' faster, still, this is a master piece. Probably one of the best games ever designed (along with the rest of this series of course). This is the game i would pick when you can only take one game with you to a deserted island.

[Abstract Strategy] [2P:5] Gipf is the first of Kris Burm's new age abstracts. It's interesting for a while, but it quickly begins to feel like work. It lacks the breezy, creative feel of YINSH, and the downhill, decisive strikes of DVONN. I'd prefer to play the two younger Burm games when 2P abstracts are the jeux du jour. My ranking of the series: TAMSK (9) YINSH (8), PUNCT (7), DVONN (6), GIPF (5), ZERTZ (4).

After the first play I'm not quite as taken with GIPF as I was with TZAAR and YINSH. GIPF is slower, not quite the tour de force of the other games, yet strangely no less compelling. Even though it was missing that initial spark (or maybe *because* this feeling of 'I get it' was not there), I feel oddly curious about how further matches play out.

Whatever the result of that may be, the GIPF series is no doubt as fine an ambassador of abstract games as one might find anywhere.

Not as inventive as the other Gipf project games. In my opinion, it is a bit too lengthy abstract game considering there is almost no progression. I prefer the other, shorter, games of this project.

Also, I was very disappointed when I learned what was the link between all the games of the series. A bit lame. I was expecting a clever way of putting the games together to form a Über game experience. But, this is not why I bought them in the first place so they lost no rating points because of this.

RATING: 8
GIPF is as good as an abstract can get because the rules are quite simple, and yet it has you thinking about tactics and strategy throughout the game.  Unlike the other games in the series, GIPF doesn't have a foreseeable endpoint; players could conceivably extend play forever. As such, both players must understand the two distinct strategies that make up the two halves of the game. This is a very pleasant abstract.  Use the 'Standard Rules' which introduces the GIPF pieces and gives the game its character and more tension.

This game generally serves to tick me off, but I hate not understanding a game, so I keep going back.  Dvonn, Yinsh, and Zertz are all so much better  Perhaps my rating will go up once I get a handle on setting up plays, instead of just reacting.

RATING: 8.5
Thirteen face-to-face plays, lots of online plays. I've finally graduated to the tournament rules, and I think the game plays best this way because of the increased massing of Gipf pieces which creates a less volatile and more strategic game. 

I find the game fascinating; like chess, it demands look-ahead, but direct assaults on any particular piece are usually easily foiled and so players must be more subtle, developing dangerous situations on the board which they hope will eventually become a problem for their opponent.

The one characteristic that might be off-putting to some is that the game is a war of attrition. The board has a tendency to "reset," with threats coming and going, and so good players will be like two sharks circling each other and taking tiny nibbles out of each others' tails until one of them can't swim any more. 

I also enjoy playing with the expansions; so far I've tried the Tamsk, Zertz and Dvonn potentials. The Tamsk potentials didn't add much, but the Dvonn and Zertz ones can be quite powerful. We also tried linking the base game to the other games in the project via the potentials, but I disliked breaking the flow of the Gipf game. A neat idea, but not for me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This might rise after more plays.  Initially I was disappointed in GIPF, especially as I really liked the other games in the series (ZERTZ and YINSH especially).  After playing the tournament rules a few times I'm beginning to come around and seeing more in the game.
UPDATE:  I'm raising my rating based on more plays with the tournament rules.  I think this is the only way to play the game.  I much prefer having 2 ways to win (capturing GIPF pieces or running your opponent out of pieces).
UPDATE2:  I'm raising it again from even more playing.  I find myself seeing some of the deeper mechanics after further plays and it has raised my enjoyment

This is a great abstract.  Minutes to learn and more time than I can really put in to master.  The simple clean design of the game really appeals to me.  Even though this was the first game in the series the gameplay keeps it as the best in the projects history despite the fact that it isn't quite as pretty as it's progeny.

I was ULTRA bad at this; could not see its depths or really even its basic dynamics.

A quality game, if sometimes a bit opaque.  I recommending downloading GIPF for One and letting the computer kick you around for a bit.  That's how I started figuring out how to play this one.

That being said, once you begin to grasp good gameplay, the possibilities become amazing.  And then there are the potentials....

I've had this one a while, without playing. I'd heard it wasn't one of the better of the series. However, I actually kind of liked it. It doesn't feel as unique as some of the others, but it still has a very solid design. Simple rules provoking thoughtful play.

Seemed quite difficult to manouvre yourself into a dominant position. We spent most of the time completing four in a row just to get some of our own pieces back. I guess it'll take time to see the strategy and spot the good moves.

Zasady gry można zrozumieć po pierwszym krótkim tłumaczeniu. Pierwsze gry trwają zazwyczaj kilka minut. Z czasem gry stają się coraz dłuższe, zbijanie pionów przeciwnika coraz bardziej skomplikowane a miejsca wprowadzenia nowych pionów coraz mniej oczywiste. Jednocześnie gra daje coraz więcej satysfakcji. Człowiek nawet sam nie orientuje się kiedy zaczyna analizować najpierw jeden ruch na przód potem drugi i następne (na prawdę to dzieje się jakoś tak samo z siebie).
Ponad to gra ma możliwość rozbudowy o pionki zwane potencjałami które posiadają charakterystyczne dla siebie zdolności ale to już wyższa szkoła jazdy.

RATING: 7
Another winner in the series. This time, inspired by Pente. The twist here is once you gain your row, you capture any opponent's pieces also on that row. Whereas in Yinsh, it is best to stay on the outside, in Gipf, it is best to stay on the inside. A rewarding abstract.

really nice abstract strategy. As with all the GIPF project games, I feel this suffers from the problem where it's not as fun when you have vastly differing skill levels.

RATING: 8
What's really lovely about the GIPF project as a whole is that each game has a distinct feel, flavour, and flow to it. I say this because GIPF, is like rolling waves. Perhaps, more specifically, trying to build a sand castle as rolling waves sway in and out. 

The titular GIPF game is a heavily modified version of connect four (similar to YINSH in some regards) but this connection of four is one in which you are encouraged for your line of four to also have your opponents pieces in it as they will be captured and removed off the board as you remove your line of four or more back to your reserve. Rushing in, rushing out... but with less and less pieces as you go on. The way in which you add a piece at the edge and push it (and any other piece along the line) inwards really anchors the wave for me (and the crumbling sand castle). As the game progresses and you have less and less to work with, you are faced with difficult choices (i.e., which part of the sand castle do I uphold, I can't build up the rampart fast enough and the next wave is coming!). It is quite a different experience from DVONN, ZERTZ, and TZAAR which escalate towards an inescaple climax incrementally.

It is worth noting that there is a "pièce touchée, pièce jouée" (i.e., you touch it, you move it) rule in the rule book. For me, this was a throwback to days playing chess.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I have to be in the right mood for this one. It doesn't grab me the way some other Project Gipf games do. I dislike that the primary (somewhat fun) goal of capturing Gipf pieces is usually less important than the secondary (not fun) goal of forcing your opponent to run out of pieces. It makes for an unsatisfying game. Also, it must be said: this game is ugly, even by abstract game standards.

The original GIPF, and still a contender- this is a solid game which I am rating a 7 on one solo, basic play, but which has the potential to climb. The tactics of simultaneously setting up and defending against 'mills' of 4 stones (to go back to 9 Men's Morris terminology) are not transparent, and the battle of setting them up without weakening overall position seem subtle, and fascinating. While it seems a definite descendant, it is an interesting and solid game in it's own right, and I look forward to playing it more and possibly raising this rating some more. A good, solid game - just what we have come to expect from Kris Burm.

After playing GIPF many times now my rating has gone up. While I still think that Yinsh and Zertz are better games, GIPF has grown on me. The different potentials give the game a high replay value because each one shifts the strategy of the game significantly. GIPF is the most difficult of the GIPF Project games to become good at.

First played December 27th, 2007. Taught in <5min played in ~20min. This two player game is strategy weighted in the strategy/luck scale. After one game play, I had some ideas of what the game is like, however it will probably take several gameplays to figure out some strategies. The object is to be the last with disc to place in the game (from their reserve pile). Each player takes turns placing a disc on the outer dots and slides it inward one intersection. If there is a disc there, reguarless of color, it's push in the same direction. The same is true if there is another disc in the next intersection. A disc can not be pushed off the board to a dot, so if a move would cause this, it is an invalid move. If after a disc is placed, it causes four disc of the same color to be aligned, all four are taken up and returned to that player's reserve pile. Also any connected dics in that same line are picked up. Any opponent chips are captured and out of the game. For those out there that are interested in abstract strategy, this is a good one to try. If you know someone who has it, give it a try. Also give it consideration in puchase.

RATING: 6
Initial rating 2 plays

Pretty nifty overall and very tricky, more than it looks like which is not surprising considering the other games in the series.  I find it very very tug of warish, seems to be hard making subtle moves.  

I think the overall scope is lacking, you can set up one creative move or maybe two most but you won’t be working on like 3 or more moves or 3 or more different areas at the same time like some of the other games in the series but judging from some Geekbuddy comments I must be missing something, I just don't see the depth here of Chess or Go (although nothing is as Deep as Go) so I'll have to give this more play just to see what is anything I am missing. 

Right now I enjoy Dvonn or Yinsh much more

Very provisional rating.  Like all the GIPF games, I have no idea what I'm doing.  I'm sure that as I play more, the strategies will unravel themselves.  But for now, I push pieces on to the board and see what happens.  I then play tactically, not strategically, which is (I'm sure) not how the game is to be played.

Update: after more plays, I'm beginning to understand better, and enjoy it as much as the others in the series.  Up to an 8.

RATING: 6
2016-07-05 - 7 - Don't bother with the basic variant. It's nothing special. Standard rules with GIPF pieces are interesting. The game is slower than YINSH, but it might be pretty deep. We'll see after more plays. DVONN might be more interesting, but only in its second half (I don't like the first) and that makes me keep this game while DVONN is gone (it rhymes!).

2016-09-08 - 7->6 - After few more plays I consider this one to be the least favourite from GIPF project games I played so far. Mostly because of lack of dynamics which distinguished othe titles from the series. And it is too long for what it is for me. Still an OK game, but there are better ones.

made the board myself, using backgammon playing pieces, that was fun, but I never got around to play against a human. The rules are so forgettable I have to look them up every time. And that tells me it's not a good abstract game. The rules of chess, checkers and go feel far more natural (pente while an excellent game also has hard to remember rules, especially the setup).

GIPF is a strategic game for two players based on a classic concept: in turns, players introduce one piece into play until achieving four-in a-row. Players then remove their row and capture any of their opponent's pieces which extend that row. This principle of capturing pieces creates each time again completely changed situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive rows of at least 4 pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to bring into play.

A statement of intent, an explosion of gaming ambition in grey.  Though the black and white pieces share the same heritage of Chess and Go it is unlikely that these inventors would of drawn their ideas onto such a canvas.  And though Gipf will now never really challenge these two giants of the gaming world in popularity if this was year zero than Gipf would of been a contender.  The beauty of the game is not just in the simple aesthetics but in the detail.  The shape of the board, the inclusion of pieces into the game, the areas of influence, the difficult choices, the pursuit of your opponent and even the playing pieces have shown that Burm is himself a giant in the gaming world.  A game I will play not only for the next few weeks but in ten years time and still be surprised.

RATING: 10
While not quite as fun as it's younger brother YINSH, GIPF manages to pack a surprising amount of depth, strategy, tactics and fun into such seemingly stodgy rules.  A single move has far-ranging implications like the proverbial butterfly beating its wings.  Far more interesting than the almost as stodgy, but much less fun, DVONN.

UPDATE: I've now played dozens of games of GIPF online and in person, and it's purity and depth are captivating. The more you play, the more it reveals. While YINSH's freewheeling nature still makes it more fun, GIPF may be the better design, aesthetically, and it's own unconventional geometry holds appeals of its own. GIPF is a ten.

A mind-boggling game if I've ever played one.  Capturing is essential in this game, and often it's yourself that you're capturing.  I've never felt so restricted in movement, and yet this is where restrictions breed creativity.  This game may be harder to master than what some may have patience for, but that's alright.

A very clever 2-player checkers-style game, with the OPTION of adding "potentials", or rules-variants, corresponding to the moves available in other GIPF-Project games.  A unique approach to a board game, and like its nephew DVONN, it makes you think in a novel fashion.

Not my favorite of the series. It is a little slow and I can't imagine we'd ever play the full game with the GIPF potentials. In the games we've played it became very defensive and taking your own pieces without capturing a seemingly reasonable option. Perhaps with more plays my opinion would change.

RATING: 6
Game in Nutshell: An abstract of capturing pieces by getting four of your own in a row and taking what else falls in your line.

Two-player only.

Pros: Probably up there as one of the easiest games I've ever had to explain the rules for. Can go pretty quickly as far as abstracts go. The mystery in its apparent depth keeps me interested. It's nice to have a slightly simplified version of the game included in the rules to help get players started, and then move to the standard rules (where a simple rule change makes a world of difference) after a couple plays. 

Cons: Not necessarily pretty. Doesn't invoke a strong desire for replay probably in large part to the need for an abstract pattern recognition before a sense of strategic planning could be achieved. In other words, it's simple to get in to, but it gets steep from there to understanding.

Other: I wonder how long it'll take to grasp this game to where I'll recognize good play. The standard rules really add a much needed second dimension to the game so don't get stuck or judge to harshly on basic rules alone.

Best Use: For gamers who fondly remember the old school abstracts and what something new from that mold.

Pro: the game mechanics are super smooth and seem to be very original. And I just like the pushing.

Neutral: As hard as Yinsh to find a long term strategy so only for players who can walk in the darkness for a long time and get their enjoyment out of brilliant tactical play.

Con: If the difference in captured pieces gets to high you know who is going to win, but after that the game drags on before the official winning conditions are reached. I think only 2 very experienced players can have a tense game till the end.

RATING: 9
The excellent foundation game for the Gipf Project. It's a longer, deeper, more intense game than the others in the series (and perhaps a little blander to look at), and thus I don't get to it as often as I'd like.

Love the overarching idea of linking Gipf to the other games via their "potentials;" less enamored of the "interrupt Gipf to play one of the other games" mechanic for introducing them. Luckily, you don't have to use it, simply bring them in when you want. I've only tried using the potentials once--it was fun and certainly seemed to have a lot of, well, potential. [14 plays] 

The Project's six games:
Gipf, Tamsk, Zèrtz, Dvonn, Yinsh, Pünct, Tzaar.

Mon préféré de la série (mais il n'a pas été un coup de coeur instantané, contrairement à DVONN et YINSH).

GIPF propose des séances d’analyse pour deux joueurs. Mais attention: le but est d'épuiser son adversaire avant de l'être soi-même!

Défense ou attaque (un peu comme avec TZAAR), le joueur est confronté dans les deux cas à « concéder ».

Les alignements de pièces (un peu comme avec YINSH) doivent être bien planifiés, car lorsqu’il s’en produit un, un affaiblissement de nos forces est presque inévitablement créé.

L’objectif du jeu étant de provoquer une situation où l’adversaire se voit incapable de jouer, c’est également la menace qui plane dans notre propre camp : éviter d’être pris dans une situation où il sera impossible d’aligner 4 de nos pièces!

Ce jeu, plus que les autres du projet, me fait penser aux échecs. C’est un jeu de combat. On attaque, on se défend, on repositionne sans cesse nos forces pour qu’elles occupent des trajectoires optimales, on se concentre particulièrement sur le centre...  Et bien souvent, nos idées peuvent s’avérer « logiques » mais néanmoins être « perdantes », faute d’un petit tempo de retard par rapport à notre adversaire, tempo qui fait toute la différence.

Comparativement à TZAAR et DVONN, que j'aime néanmoins, j'apprécie particulièrement la situation de départ, où la plaque est complètement vide - ce qui est tout le contraire des deux autres jeux, où les positions de départ sont très chargées, voire un peu "chaotiques".

Ce n'est peut-être qu'un détail, mais j'apprécie également la façon simple (et intégrée aux règles) de pouvoir jouer avec un handicap contre un joueur moins expérimenté.

My initial rating of this game was 6. After playing more it went to 8. Now it is at 9, it may go upper. After many games I start appreciating how subtle and beautiful this game is. And I have just started to use potentials: a completely new story...

UPDATE 16th oct 2007: Playing with potentials now... WOW... rating moved to 10. The best abstract game after Go that I have ever played. It needs some time to show its beauty. I am hooked now.

UPDATE 23rd nov 2007: rating back to 9. I have played ultimate GIPF (with all the potentials). The game even improved, but now my interest to play again has diminished. Probably I "burnt" the game playing too much. In any case recommended (I played really A LOT of games and I enjoyed them). 

UPDATE 5th November 2011

First impression: Game definitely has many skill levels to achieve. In my first game I really had trouble trying to even spot where you can achieve sequence of four. I've played only two games but game feels very good abstract. It feels just wrong to give it rating any less than 8 but I did since I have close to zero interest of playing it again. Nothing wrong with the game.

RATING: 10
Gipf is one of the best abstracts I've played, and one of the best games, period. It succeeds by being disarmingly simple in theory, but can become an amazing battle, with moves and countermoves that unfold in unexpected and delightful ways. Gipf sometimes gets dinged for it's endgame, which can become drawn out between players of equal skill, but even a 'long' game is playable in under 90 minutes.

RATING: 8
The simplest set of rules of the series (with an add-on using special pieces), Gipf reminds very strongly of Abalone pushing the pieces into play. Though, it's way more dynamic and the sawtooth playing dynamics keep the gameplay even throughout the round if there's not a big difference between the players -the raw version of the game is really elegant. Using the Gipf stones makes it more difficult and thrilling, but ultimately not as fluid. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Only a few plays so far but this game certainly made a good first impression on me.  I find the rules are very easy to understand but the strategy is the challenging part.  I suspect this is one of those "easy to learn - difficult to master" games.  That said, I really like what this game does to my brain.  For me, it has an addictive quality that leaves me thinking about it for some time afterwards and makes me want to play again (although I fear the mental exhaustion that may result from several back-to-back games).  My first introduction to the games of the GIPF series and I was intrigued enough to hunt down some of the others in the project.

It's like a sliding version of Yinsh. You're trying to get 4 in a row of your own pieces, but you're also trying to the other players pieces with it. I found it harder personally to grasp over the other games in the series. I think it's the sliding aspect that's throwing me off.

Not a bad game, but I did not enjoy playing it. From GIPF series I like DVONN a lot. Pity that GIPF itself did not suit me.

Solid abstract, that the board changes rather than develops makes things a bit different.  The Potentials make it a more interesting game IMHO, and I prefer the other games in the series, but even so it's very, very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Probably the weakest link in the GIPF series (ironically enough). The whole systems seems to be basing on attrition and slowly devouring your opponent.
And yet again, the moves in board are difficult to predict so any long-term strategy will probably go wasted. You'll need a lot of practice. I'll just rather practise with Zertz and Tamsk (which is a lot more gipf than this imho..)

They keep getting better in the GIPF series.  The idea of initiatives doesn't really pan out very well, and the game itself isn't the best of the series.  It has something of a checkers/go feeling where pieces can only come in from the sides and push all the other edge pieces closer to the middle.  Curious actions may happen, but I think there's just not as much depth here.

RATING: N/A
I find this one compelling, but I couldn't share any strategy insight, as the game remains as opaque now as it was during my first play. I will say that a lot of people start with the very basic game, the version that features no stacked GIPF pieces. Don't do that. For your first play, just play the version with the GIPF pieces. The give-and-take of the game gets a little clearer when you have to protect the double pieces, because you start to feel how short your own leash really has to be. That's an interesting constraint because it limits the size of the decision tree that you have to subject yourself to, and that's very helpful; if you could just continuously add pieces to the board, the game would be overwhelming. 

Seven years later, I am still waiting for an opportunity to play with one of the potentials. I have every intention of remedying that, though I said that last year, and the year before, and, and, and…

Excellent game. It has really grown on me. Fine balance and easy to learn. When you have a pc. advantage you want to PREVENT rows from forming in order to run your opponent out of pcs. first and ergo win the game. I still like DVONN's design best of the GIPF series, but this is a very strong offering. I also appreciate the HEX /B&W motif present in ALL of these games. Very stylish!

Played about 10 games of GIPF now, albeit we initially played the first 3 wrong. NOTE: the game plays much much differently if you play it where it takes rows of FIVE instead of FOUR... Whoops ! :blush:

This is the type of game that will take many more plays to truly get a handle on the strategy and how to properly open the game, and I'll hold off rating it until then. That shouldn't be too long though with the amount that I'm playing it...

Fantastic abstract game.  Not really a strategic or tactical game as the situation changes completely with every move.

A very enjoyable abstract.... easy to learn, but you will need practice and study to master. The GIPF potentials ratchet this up a notch, and it's not often that you come across an abstract with that kind of customization. The meta-game aspect with these can make a session of GIPF fairly epic. Highly recommended for any fan of abstract games.

Connection game with a few twists. I like it a lot. I've found it's among the easiest of the GIPF series to grasp straight away. It's also the longest. The game could potentially go on forever, at least in theory, though not in practice. It's more of a battle of attrition than a blitz.

Kim called it "aggressive connect 4", which I guess works. Discs are slid into a hexagonal grid; if four are ever in a row, any discs extending the four are also removed. The player who owns the four gets their pieces back and captures any of the opponents which are removed.

Very elegant, very interesting abstract. My comparatively low rating is because I seem constitutionally unable to play it well; I seem to be incredibly awful at the flavour of pattern recognition it requires. I am interested in getting better but it's hard to be enthusiastic. This must be how some non-gamers feel about [i]my[/i] favourite games...

Edit: rating back up, I still suck at it but there's clearly a lot of depth there. Should play more!

Gipf is a wonderful brain-burning abstract game.  Each game has a different feel due to the decision of how many Gipf pieces to commit to the board at the beginning.  You can play aggressively by attacking the other Gipf pieces, or chip away and win by attrition.  The potentials from the other games in the series only add to the depth.

Great abstract 2 player game.  Very simple to learn and play, but quickly leads to very interest move-counter move situations.  Can't wait to try it with the expansions!

I played this after having played YINSH, DVONN, PUNCT, ZERTZ, and TZAAR.  So now the only one I haven't tried yet is TAMSK.  I liked GIPF, definitely liked it more than PUNCT or ZERTZ.  However, not as much as I like YINSH or DVONN.  Maybe just because I'm more familiar with YINSH and DVONN, and all of these games definitely reward familiarity and repeated plays.  They're all deceptively simple and straightforward, yet have a lot of depth underlying them.  GIPF felt a bit constrained in terms of what you could do and certain turns felt like they were a foregone conclusion.  I need to play it more to explore it further though.

Interesting first play.  I'm thinking a lot of the strategy comes from making sure you have multiple paths to creating rows, and clustering a lot of your pieces together (if your opponent doesn't catch on) is a great way to do that.

A pleasant abstract. In my small number of plays, any real strategy eludes me beyond turn-to-turn tactics. It's enjoyable though, and it causes interesting geometric reasoning and thinking. It's tough, because unlike the other games where's there's a much more tangible goal, everything feels so defensive-minded here.

I LOVE the GIPF games in general, and the original Gipf is one of the best.  Simple rules but hard to win makes this a great 2-player abstract strategy game. I haven't played the series with potentials, but given the time would like to try an all out GIPF tournament with potentials including all the GIPF games! My order of favorites in the GIPF series are:

ZERTZ
TZAAR
DVONN
PUNCT
GIPF
YINSH
TAMSK (taken out of GIPF, replaced by TZAAR.)

This is a great abstract game. It is tense and deep. The GIPF pieces (standard or tournament rules) are essential. The game play displays ‘emerging properties’ that make GIPF fascinating. Managing the constantly shifting emphasis between creating threats and maintaining your reserve is challenging.

A great namesake for project GIPF! I love this game, as it is very elegant, but has many strategies that are not immediately apparent. I am also looking forward to using the potentials to link the other games in the project to GIPF. The standard game is excellent, but the tournament game adds an extra level of strategy onto the game. It is possible to win with only a few GIPF pieces, while it is also possible to win by only playing GIPF pieces. Great game!

На мой взгляд ощутимо уступает Dvonn из одноименного проекта. В GIPF есть эффект "снежного кома". Небольшой, но есть. Стоит "зевнуть" - и очень трудно выйти снова на паритет. В TZAAR и особенно в DVONN шансов на камбэк больше.

Juego de reglas sencillas que esconde mucho....las jugadas maestras del oponente son, en ocasiones, difíciles de visualizar. Una partida llama a otra partida.

A game with simple rules hiding a lot of strategy. The opponent's master moves are not easy to visualize. You will normally play more than once to this game.

While I have not explored GIPF to the extent that I have TZAAR and YINSH, it is perhaps the game that most intrigues me in the series. Wrapping your head around the somewhat indirect way that influence is applied is an enthralling challenge. Wanting to play this more; could become my favorite in the series.

Kris Burm; strategic game for two players based on a classic concept: in turns, players introduce one piece into play until achieving four-in a-row; part of Project Gipf
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Neat!  I can see the "Brum" in this design after playing Yinsh, in the way that he creates the board to prevent anyone turtling along one edge to collect a lot of discs.  I also like the push mechanism, though the static setup for each game might lead to some scripted moves with repeated games.  It's not Yinsh, but I do like it.  I might be able to get my wife interested in it, too!

Not as aesthetically pleasing as the subsequent games, but what a robust and interesting system. The fact that the potentials can hang so nicely off this structure without unbalancing it is pretty amazing in and of itself.

New edition bakelite pieces are...underwhelming. I wish they'd opted for the mixed/granite color scheme, but instead you have ivory (distinctly not white) and black. If my glass is half-full, I note the improved contrast with the white potentials, so you won't mistake any for just a single piece...sigh. Of course the box is an improvement.

This is a great, heavy, 2 player abstract game where players try to place their discs four-in-a-row on a hex grid and capture their opponents pieces.  You need to stay alert because the situation on the board can change pretty fast in this challenging game.

Played several times. At first it did not really appeal to me, but I enjoy it more and more as I play it. The rules are simple, and I enjoy the way the players can slowly gain small advantages until one of them is forced to merely play for survival. Along with Dvonn, my favourite in the Gipf project.

I like all the Gipf series games - when I want a change from anything with any theme at all. Have never got into the "Uber" game though where you're supposed to play a central Gipf game with the other games in the series in between to resolve in-game conflicts. I don't have the patience for that

The slowest of the GIPF games (the only one I haven't played is Punct). This war of attrition is interesting, but perhaps a little too methodical and obtuse. It's hard to differentiate a good move from a bad move. Possibly harder than it should be. Need more plays of this.

01/04/14 - Whoa.  Don't spend a long time not playing this game or you'll forget how to play it well.

11/10/08 - On account of its radness, Gipf is hereby officially rated a 9.

06/30/06 - Rating 8:  Playing Gipf reminds me of how I imagine I'd feel being an Olympic Fencer (preferably a French one, though that's irrelevant to how I feel about the game).  In Gipf, you have to be subtle and you have to keep it up because the board keeps resetting.  Gipf will make you sweat, cry, bleed, and maybe even incontinent, but in the end, it will have all been worth it (unless you lost, of course).

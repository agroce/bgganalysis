2 & 3 Player play tests: This is an economy evolution game NOT A WAR GAME. Consisting of 4 layers DR Congo plays from a simple base with added layers on complexity and interaction. Although competing against other players and the in game insurgents there is an interesting dilemma when the need to cooperate with each other arises.  

A lot of promising stuff but this isn't the final version so I will hold fire on a rating.

Play 3: Further rule tweaks and clarifications. The focus for winning is now sharper and reduces game length. Revised auction system makes for some very tough decisions. Almost every action needs to be mindful of disadvantaging your opponent. Greater understanding leads to greater potential nastiness. 2 Player game took 2.5 hours. 

Gifted to Coxy as he helped with the play test.

Provisional rating, only played the CORE game so far, but can see the potential.

Only grip so far is the choice of player colours - the green player keeps wanting to place/take all crop cubes (because they are green) and the blue player keeps wanting to place/take all hydro cubes (because they are blue). Why couldn't they have picked non-player colours for the resources :(

*** Update
Wanted to like this, but after several games the luck of combat vs insurgents just makes the game not fun. You can plan and roll badly and suffer, or you can fluke a high roll and survive, and the impact is very significant. I don't mind luck/risk in my games, but too much hinges on this element. We've seen runaway wins (or more often one player just tanking ... then it's no fun for them).

Sigh, another KickStarter regret.

Now traded away, but I'd probably play it again if pressed.

Nice surprise of an economic development game with some nice specific mechanisms appropriate to the theme of developing the DRC. I particularly enjoy the Electing Ministers, Rebels Uprisings, and Pacekeeper activities amidst all of the building cities and industries. It's nice to watch the country grow as you put down rebel insurgencies (or try to).  There's enough variability with starting barons, transportation routes, and dimaond locations, to allow for different strategies during repeated plays. Recommended for solo play.

RATING: 7.9
Very interesting.  Socio-economic game in the vein of the COIN series without the military.  A bit of Power Grid in that you're building infrastructure and dealing with shifting external markets.  There's some screwage in how you interact with players but no direct conflict.

Like, Fief, there's also a touch of randomness (although not as severe) in rolling dice to take out Insurgents with your Peacekeeper forces.  Insurgents muck up your supply lines and make life difficult.

Intriguing and definitely excellent.

DRCongo explores a hopeful hypothesis that if enlightened industrialists worked to develop the economy of this mighty country, then it would escape the clutches of a crippling insurgency. Players build industries and expand a transport network of river, rail and roads. Oil, minerals and crops are produced and if sold via the Atlantic port of Matadi, players reap rich rewards. Players develop their own cities and hydroelectricity can be sold to these.

RATING: 7.6
Great ideias are put together in this game: Economic development blend with political influence and a fight against "insurgents" that keep poping up.
 
This is not, by any means, a light game, however, the rules are not so hard to follow once you get the hang of it. Still, lots of AP can occur, since you have to try to maximize your limited actions (to produce, to export, to upgrade cities, to start industries, etc) and do that in the best possible order to gain the most profit from the markets (sell while the prices are up and the cities have still no electricity supply) and the exporting routes are still open. Thus, the game can easily last for 3, 4 or more hours.
Besides, the "grey insurgents" are really annoying and a source of frustration, since they can random hit at any place and last for a random period, unbalancing the game. Furthermore, whoever stays close to the sea has a great (too much) advantage with the exporting prices, if one remembers that the original province is picked randomly. The game is not adjust for the number of players, since 3 or 4 players fight the insurgents better and their numbers are always the same, regardless of the number of players...
Summing up, it´s a great ideia within a very reasonable game that needs to be streamlined, get several rough edges cut and, above all, get its time shortened.

I really enjoyed my first play (Core Rules only) and I'm looking forward to exploring this game more.  I could see the rating increasing in the future.

edit. - We tried the Insurgents game and, WOW, what a difference that makes!!!  This really puts some serious challenge into the game.  Our next go will be with the full Ragnar game as that offers several ways to deal with the nasty little buggers.  Still loving DRCongo!

Don't let the listing of 2 hours fool you, this is a 3 hour game (so 4 + rules explanation on the first play). It's good though; the auction, trade routes, insurgents and diversification being required for first turn mean this game has lots of neat mechanics

But I think we all felt that for the last turn and a half all decent available actions had been used up so it would have been neater if the game had gone faster then

Long, heavy-ish economic game with random elements (that I like) making it not totally calculable (hello Powergrid), albeit players can take a while if they stress over every move as there are quite a few moving parts.

The board opens up as production facilities and infrastructure spread, while insurgents are a constant pain. The weaker white insurgents aren't too bad, but the tougher grey ones are a challenge, albeit also a potential source of points (and diamonds!) of you can deal with them.

The market is pretty cool, as are the government minister positions.

Having a starting position on the cost is beneficial especially if the other starting positions are way inland.

This is a economic Brass-lite game but much more thematic, including elements (insurgents, government, foreign countries) with the aim of disturbing and influencing. About the artwork, I like the pastel colors but the dark background of the map and the comic font for numbers and letters are extremely dreadful.

RATING: 6
DRCongo is caught firmly in between two stools. Thematic gamers will find the euro framework of setting up industries to produce goods to earn money to generate VPs too dry. Eurogamers will object to the amount of luck to a degree that a player can be taken out of the race for victory by an insurgent popping up in the wrong place and messing up a decisive dice roll. It doesn't help that DRCongo is slow-moving unless players are experienced (our first game took 4 hours) and the rules are difficult to follow. 

The main culprit causing confusion and delay is the insurgency system. There are many modifications to all game actions depending on suppressed or unsuppressed insurgent being in the area. It's difficult to figure out when a fight has to happen and when it's optional. A few original rules have to be mentioned positively, specifically the auction mechanism for ministers and the increasing money->VP relation at game end. The market mechanism works nicely and the transport system is solid.

Dividing up the rules into four parts wasn't a good idea. I can't imagine the game being fun without all systems thrown into the game. Beginners won't play this anyway and experienced gamers can cope with all rules at once. Comprehensibleness would have been greatly improved if all rules pertaining an item were in one place instead of four.

It's an ok game but I doubt that I will ever play again. Given the close scores (2 VP's between first and third player), the luck factor is too high for a game of this length. The experience itself wasn't immersive enough to justify playing DRCongo without caring about the outcome. There are too many better choices competing for the coveted full night heavy game spot.

Wow, those are tiny diamonds!  The box feels a bit flimsy, so have to be careful.  I like the game...a lot.  We of course played with everything thrown in, and I cannot think of playing without them.  I really like the insurgents, although they throw a lot of randomness into the fray.  The governmental positions can also be quite nasty and I can imagine bidding gets harsh in a 4-player game.  I also like the way the market works.  All around positive impressions.

It's a theme you can have a lot of fun with, and it's required because your game can be stuffed by the flipping of a card followed by a bad die roll so a fun theme wipes a little of that bad taste away. It starts off like Brass, building industries and shipping cubes to make money. Then rebels appear on the board (the card flip). If a head rebel appears early in an area you have a vested interest in, and you don't get lucky with the combat die roll, suddenly your money dries up. Then you can't pay for combat troops, or further investment and you're off the game pace. Harsh. The lesson is to spread your risk. But you need to concentrate as well to build and expand your cities, which are worth big points. I found it fun to play, but I had lucky die rolls throughout my one play to help make it so. I can easily see it going the other way.

Only played the basic game, according to the owner that's only half of the rulebook. The basic game is OK, but it's not that I had a wow-feeling after playing it or felt a need to own this game. Scores were extremely close together, which is a bit logic as you by/built point after point. Only cities are double points, so you certainly want those!

INITIAL ASSESSMENT: 
terrible rulebook

Game demand 4 players. 

Unsure of long term replayability. 

2 player 'core' game = not worth playing
3 player 'insurgent' game = not bad, but a lot of it (vps) hinges on die rolls. 


---
CURRENT ASSESSMENT: 
Only the "full/complete" game is worth playing. the "full/complete" game is not bad with 2 players; sweet spot might actually be with 3 (but perhaps 4). With 2 players, the goverment acts as a kind of schizophrenic third dummy player, which is interesting. 

A problem: the game is very unforgiving. This is especially problematic as a poor insurgent die roll can completely devastate a player, which can really be no fun. 

The game has some interesting elements, though. Even with the variable set up (via the ID cards), the game seems to typically play out in the same basic way. The finance minister is certainly the weakest minister, especially as the game goes on and everyone is forced to diversify their industries. 

Still, such a terrible rulebook! They need to write a complete one for the "full" game (instead of the modular current one)

Excellent game - interesting theme. A tight economic game with the unpredictable variable of insurgents turning up to mess with plans, although players do have options to enable defences to be built. The election - sorry - auction(!) of government ministers is interesting, as is the operation of the government, almost as a separate "player" in the game, with it's actions being taken by whichever player has been elected as, sorry - has bought, the Interior Minister. The game revolves around developing cities, building industries of 4 different types, building export routes, and selling the output of those industries, hopefully to the higher priced International Market, or to the cheaper local market if all else fails. Looking forward to further plays of this

Players act as industrial barons attempting to exploit the untapped resources of the Congo and to turn that wealth into investments in the cities of the country. The challenges faced are not just a fickle market and the cost of production  -  the countryside is beset with rebels who will stop your economic activities, to reach valuable foreign markets infrastructure needs to be developed and to create local markets you need to develop urban centres.  Government help is at hand – but at a price, and you will be bidding against the other  industrialists for the help of the finance ministry, the army and the ministry of the Interior (infrastructure). Controlling these departments at the right time is essential to keeping production running and to impose some peace upon the map (that suits you – remiving military units from a territory dominated by an opponent is just of the nasty tricks that can be played in the Congo. Players also have their own private security forces to call upon – again at a price. They are used to help keep insurgency down in areas you wish to exploit, but can also be used to gain victory points if they help defeat rebels elsewhere.  Each turn, event cards may be purchased to aid you or hinder others. Money is tight in the game, and precious victory points can be traded for cash.
 
This this is an intense economic game with all the Ragnar hall marks of a rich and unusual  theme and lots of cut throat player interaction.

Nice looking game, but there are some production problems including microscopic diamonds (that needed to be replaced) and a solid insert which unfortunately doesn't hold the punched components (what were they thinking?).

Also, illogical choice of color schemes (some resources that are similar to player colors, huh?).

Rulebook is a bit of a challenge, but is actually better than the usual Ragnar game. Four layers of play so you can build the complexity (note: the solitaire game requires all four levels).

There are some interesting design concepts here, and overall this a fun game.

Very good indeed. Played base game only, excellent market/network system. The second edition could be stunning, perhpas with a new setting.

Rather too many restrictions - counters, spaces, money vp cap, city sites - that made us a little baffled as to what constituted mid and end games. Eventually you have nothing to do except produce and sell, in our case for perhaps three turns. Reminiscent of the autopilot end game of 18xx but with a money cap it floundered and we stopped early.

I would install a house rule for a fifth optional action to produce only which saves having to remember during the four.

The transport system is effectively unexplained in the rules!

And Mr Dicken you should know better than to award a ten to yourself!

tl;dr: pretty good start

What a stupid name! Why is the DR in there? OK, I know it stands for Democratic Republic, but either write it out or just call your game Congo.
OK, on to the game. Keep in mind these thoughts are only about the core game.
So far most of the games from the Ragnar Brothers that I have played were interesting and different, so I was looking forward to trying this one. I was surprised to see I only needed about 5 pages of rules for the core game. Too bad they could use some (a lot) of editing, but I got through them. The core game is actually a fairly simple, streamlined medium weight euro. It also leaves out any of the combat elements I understand do occur in (some of?) the other versions. Use money to build resource factories, deliver those resources to markets for more money and use that extra money to generate more income or points. It all works great and it was pretty intense, even with only 3 players vying for position on the map. There is good tension building from the very beginning.
We quite enjoyed this, and I look forward to exploring this more.
But such a shame about the stupid title, poorly written rules and ugly art.

Theme is excellent, mechanics are too. The auction is unique (well I haven't come across it before) and works really well.  Jumped straight in at the deep end and it was worth it.

An excellent thinky game, can't wait to play again.

The central I place you topple mechanism is simple yet intriguing. After several plays on the medium sized board I have hardly begun to understand how to play Carnac well.  This I take as a good sign. 

Huch & Friends has done a nice job of the production and artwork.  The bakelite pieces have a cool, tactile quality and a decent heft.

Άλλο ένα σύντομο abstract παιχνίδι για 2 άτομα. Έχουμε 28 όμοια κομμάτια (σκεφτείτε 2 κύβους ενωμένους) με τις πλευρές τους βαμμένες άσπρες και κόκκινες. Διαλέγουμε χρώμα και ξεκινάμε. Καλής ποιότητας μπαμπάτσικα components.

Στη γύρα μας τοποθετούμε ένα ‘μενίρ’ όρθιο όπου θέλουμε στο ταμπλό. Τώρα ο αντίπαλος πρέπει να το ‘ρίξει’ προς μια κατεύθυνση και μετά παίζει αυτός. Διαφορετικά μπορεί αν θέλει να αρνηθεί να ξαπλώσει το μενίρ μας, αλλά σε αυτή την περίπτωση εμείς ξαναπαίζουμε. Τα ξαπλωμένα μενίρ δεν ξανακουνιούνται.

Σκοπός μας είναι όπως βλέπουμε το ταμπλό από πάνω, να φτιάξουμε όσο το δυνατόν περισσότερες περιοχές με 3 και πάνω συνεχόμενα κουτάκια στο χρώμα μας. Επίσης στην αρχή του παιχνιδιού διαλέγουμε σε τι μέγεθος ταμπλό θα παίξουμε, για πιο χαλαρό ή σφιχτό gameplay.

Interessantes kleines Spiel, das mit drei Spielfeldgrößen geliefert wird. Die Spielfeldgröße beeinflusst das Spiel erheblich, so dass von einem hohen Widerspielwert ausgegangen werden kann. Einziges Manko sind die dunklen Spielsteine, die ein Spiel bei gedämpfter Beleuchtung schwierig machen, aber das führt nicht zu Punktabzügen. Die Spielsteine haben Hive-Qualität und sind aus Bakalit gefertigt, was ein haptisches Erlebnis sicherstellt.

What a terrific little game!  Clever, original, elegant and fun.  Despite the fact that it's completely unlike any other game I can think of, the basic gist of gameplay is very easy to pick up.  Doing well - not so much!  

So far, I've only played on Boardspace.net, which - while obviously better than nothing - is clearly not the optimal way to experience such a 3-dimensional game.  Put some nice chunky hardwood pieces in my hand, and my score is instantly a point higher.  This NEEDS to be published!

Carnac is a unique new game from Emiliano "Wentu" Venturini. It is a grouping game, with an opposite win condition to games like Nick Bentley's "Ketchup". The most groups wins, with tiebreakers settled by biggest groups. The uniqueness is in the mechanism. Players put down a piece that their opponent gets to "tip" over onto the playing surface. The single win condition leads to wildly changing strategy during the game - do you make more of your own groups, or try to connect your opponent's groups into one big group? Second player seems to have an opening advantage on the smaller boards. There is a question as to which board size is best. I lean towards the medium size board currently, but maybe the larger one is more appropriate. Several of us believe that Carnac will prove to be a classic in the years to come.

This is a fairly interesting abstract with lots of brain-burning decisions to make.  If you are so inclined to find someone who enjoys these types of games, you're sure to find challenge here with repeated plays.

Like the very best of games, the rules are simple - place a stone; your opponent can then tip it and place their own stone, or choose not to tip it and forego their turn.

What Carnac brings to the table is the need to think in 3D space, something that doesn't come easy to a lot of people, but this is a game that can help you exercise that part of your gray matter.  The temptation is to create the biggest dolemn you can, but the true heart of the matter is to have more of them than the largest one.  The size only comes into play as a tiebreaker, so if you can remain focused and make several distinct, smaller ones, you'll be in a better position to win.  This also introduces, then, the strategy of tipping stones over in order to link your opponent's dolemns together in order to minimize their board impact.  The possibilities are quite fun to tease, especially considering that you can place stones down in whatever orientation you like.  Second-guessing your opponent's move is the name of the game here.

Carnac isn't the best abstract to play in terms of strategic choices, but it's worth spending some of your time playing.  With three different board sizes in the box, you'll find plenty of challenge in such a small and affordable package, and for that you can't go wrong.

Stonehenge:The Board Game :) This is a 3D abstract strategy game of using your megaliths which are standing stones, to form dolmens which in reality are megalithic tombs with a large flat stone laid on upright ones (but in the game a group of at least 3 adjacent squares of your player colour). The person with the most dolmens wins the game. The first player places a stone standing up, then the next player must tip it over in order to be able to place another stone also standing up, or forfeit their turn. Play continues until all stones have been placed or there are no more legal moves. There is one board included in the game but you can play on one of 3 different board sizes – small, medium and large – which give you different play experiences and changes your strategy slightly from board to board. I think the small board might be my favourite but they all play equally well. 

The game is quick and easy to set up, easy to learn, plays super fast, and is very fun. I liken it to Quarto a little bit, but whereas with Quarto I could never seem to 'see' the moves, I can think a little bit in advance in this game and have a good chance of defeating my opponent who is ace at abstract strategy games. Although it is available to play on boardspace.net, the interface is a bit clunky for this type of game and to be honest there is nothing like playing in person with those nice chunky pieces! They have a really great feel to them. Everything is of decent quality and I guess I would say that the only thing I think is missing is lack of a nice draw bag so you can take the pieces with you, as the game has the potential to be very portable (if slightly heavy). Simple enough to implement via a custom order, but a missed opportunity nonetheless. I [i]really[/i] would have liked the pieces to be little stone versions of the giant version but no doubt that would have added unnecessary weight and expense to the game. A very approachable and likable abstract that is worthy of your time.

An interesting abstract that feels good in the hand with all the Bakelite blocks!  Quite puzzly and spatial and a little difficult to grok the first time around. I'm sure it gets better as you play more games of it. But as it stands right now it has a very good 3-dimensional thing going for it and it all comes together nicely. Enjoyed!

Abstract with an interesting multi-purpose move-offer mechanism. On the small board the game is a judo match where you want to avoid the centre and separate your groups. The large board seems to offer a more strategic scope at first but this is let down by the limited number of pieces.

Remek kétfős absztrakt játék, kimondottan egyedinek mondható (legalábbis nem nagyon tudom mihez hasonlítani). A kivitelezés is nagyon igényes, ez persze viszonylag magas árcédulát eredményez. Három táblaméret közül választhatunk és mindegyik elég más stílust igényel, a közepes tényleg jobb az elején, a kicsi nagyon szűkös, sokkal agresszívebb stílust hoz elő, a nagyon pedig lehet egy picit békésebben is pakolgatni. Nem az a játék, amivel nagyon gyakran játszik az ember (legalábbis mi), de megérdemli a törődést. :)

RATING: 8
A two player game with three different sized playing areas on a single rectangular board each posing different challenges and strategies.  Because of the quick play it is possible to play on each sized area in a single session and because of the strength of the abstract game you will want to try each.

The falling Carnac stones is an interesting mechanism and the balance between wanting the monolith to show your colour or the opponents is very interesting.  You may spend large parts of the game forcing your opponent to develop dolmens of their own colour which may seem counterintuitive at the start.

As you progress the game evolves in tactics and strategies where you will discover (probably not to your surprise) that the largest board plays very different to the smallest.

An interesting game which can be produced easily at home and an interesting tribute to the Carnac stones of France.

When so many 'new' games are in reality anything but (microscopic variations on other people's ideas, very often, masquerading as 'hommages'), genuine originality is a life-saving breath of fresh air. And Carnac is self-evidently the mutt's nuts in this regard.  It is the badger's nadgers.  The jackal's tackle.  Living proof, like Slither, that a single inspired touch of dynamism is all that's needed to make an otherwise static game really come alive, it's a subtle product of the interaction between its defining elements: principally, the form of the pieces, the move mechanism, and the win condition.  I'm sure Wentu would have known it was a go-er with or without the playtesting. Congratulations through gritted teeth. :)

I have now played on all board sizes; yes, it lives up to the blurb.  On the small board, the strategy is very much about joining your opponent's dolmens, while keeping yours small; on the large board, it's more about splitting the pieces and preventing the dolmens from forming; the mid-sized board supports a mixture of strategies.

Nice abstract game ...quick playing solid production ...I would love to see a nice all wood version of this game but I imagine it would be too expensive ...but similar to the games produced by Gigamic. But a good game added to our growing abstract collection. Still not found anything that topped my Gipf collection so far though ...They remain our all time favourites ...

This game looks interesting. I'm going to keep my eyes open for any new infos.

Update: I just played on Boardspace and I like the look and feel of the game. However, even on the Medium board it seems like the game ends too soon and the 28 pieces seem to be swimming in too much empty board space. I think the game would do even better on a tighter, optimally sized board accommodating at *least* 40-50 pieces instead of 28. Couldn't that number easily be used on the "full-size" 14x9 board? The game would still not be overly long, yet there would be more pieces to fully realize strategically placed earlier pieces and which uses most of the board.

update - rock solid abstract which has me addicted.  Plenty of depth to keep you coming back.  

original, subtle, cool.  Rating may go up as I plumb this things depth, but I can already tell it's a winner.  The offensive and defensive considerations in play as groups are built, defended, and connected, are a treat to work through.  You might be a Giant tipping rocks....but you better be a SMART Giant!

RATING: 6
Only played at boardspace. Clever abstract with an "offer" mechanism. Pieces are like two cubes stuck together, with faces showing one or the other player colour.

Player A puts a piece down, standing up; player B has the option of tipping it over to cover two adjacent spaces instead. If they decline, player A moves again; if they tip it or it cannot be tipped, it's player B's turn.

The winner is the player with the most groups of 3+ spaces.

Enjoyable and unusual, it would be very nice with chunky pieces. Not my favourite genre of abstract, though, and I find the core mechanism inelegant.

Based on a preliminary few plays, this game has caught my attention. The potential for dastardly connections planned a few moves out seems real and delightful. However, only repeat play will reveal if the game has another level of depth, for which I'm really hoping.

Nice abstract 2 player game with a Bretagne theme. Strategy seemed to elude us on the first play. I won by accident. There's probably more depth to it if you play more often.

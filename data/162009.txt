Whilst I like the old VG Civil War this is very similar but far more playable without becoming simplistic. The short 1861 scenario can be played in an evening even if you are new to the game (there is now a even shorter version of this scenario with 3 instead of 4 action cycles per turn). When you become familiar with the game the longer scenarios can be played in an evening too. The campaign game is also very playable (and you can play shortened versions of that too). I've played quite a few games and still haven't felt the need to add in the advanced naval rules but I will try those next. This is probably the most playable strategic game I know of (of any period) and I'm not a big civil war player. Having now played with naval rules this does give the Confederacy some protection for their coastal forts.

Beautiful components, especially the map!  This game has a great feel and is not overly complex.  I like the initiative mechanic. You have to think in terms of it not being an automatic I-go-u-go sequence, so cannot count on getting a turn immediately after your opponent's turn.  My games thus far have used the Basic game rules (misnomer, in my opinion -- should be called the Standard game).  Both sides are under a lot of stress.  The Union has an unrelenting time table for advancing and the CSA, of course, have too few resources to stop the Union everywhere.  The Advanced rules (should be thought of as Optional Naval rules) add more chrome by giving more detailed treatment to ships, ironclads, flotilla's, etc., with the additional level of complexity.  I will try those eventually, but it is a very compelling game with just the standard rule set.  There's a lot of depth here and the strategies and counter-strategies within the community are still being developed.  I would not credit any early claims that one side or the other has an overwhelming advantage.  Many will say this is the Union.  In my experience, the CSA is winning games most often.  But, it remains to be seen what really strong play from both sides will produce.

RATING: 9
One hell of a wargame. And very balanced until the very end.

The order system based on the dice differential is genius. I wonder why we don't see that in many of the newer designs.

And I like how the Union VP benchmark abstracts the North political will to pursue the war allowing the players to focus on the maneuvering and fighting aspects.

A "new classic" that will probably never leave my collection.

RATING: 7.5
Top-notch components featuring probably the best grand strategic-level map on the conflict I have ever seen. Clean, concise rules (despite the errata and Q&A that is developing) that are a pleasure to read and help one to dive right into this game. This title is exactly what I and many others have been waiting for, for a long time - that is, the beautiful birthchild of Victory Games' "The Civil War" and GMT's "For the People." It incorporates elements of both games, polishes them, and adds its own individual stamp to create quite the gem.

Despite the fact that I haven't yet gotten a full game under my belt and the small issues I have with some of the scripting (which can be immediately forgiven once one starts to play), I am going to give this a "10" at this time. Further play may affect my rating, but I don't really think so. This game is indeed a masterpiece in design and scope, supported by a designer who continues to fine-tune the system to allow for an excellent blend of gameplay and simulation value - something I haven't seen since the Victory Games title brought me into the hobby proper 3+ years ago.

***

*UPDATE - 3-10-16*

Involved presently in a team/staff game over on Consimworld. Rules continue to evolve due to outstanding dedication by the designer and designated development staff. But the fact remains that this game was not playtested enough and/or with a large enough group prior to release. Presently the Union seems overpowered (the latest living rules may help with this, as they put some "fixes" in place for 1861). I am lowering my rating (based on what the ratings represent on the BGG scale) to an "8" at this time. However, onlookers should NOT be wary - this is still a great game that will only be getting better!

*** 

UPDATE - 6-21-17

Unfortunately, I have to lower my rating once more (again, based on what the ratings represent on BGG). I started a couple games now that the rules update is finally complete, and just didn't feel the "spark" that I feel for other games I enjoy. The post-release developer for this game has put in a LOT of hard work, and is to be commended. Yet, at the end of the day, I can't put my finger on why I don't yet enjoy this game as I should. 

I think a lot of it still has to do with the unfinished product that was released initially, and the patchwork that had to be put in place. This patchwork MAY have unbalanced the game in the OTHER direction (the Union in vanilla was a juggernaut, now it has been neutered, with MANY advantages being given to the CSA player...some of them somewhat unrealistic), OR made the game TOO scripted. In all fairness, I have not played a full game with the new rules so my points aren't completely concrete - but I just am not "feeling it" at this time.

I was a playtester for the new rules, and a team captain for the first staff game on Consimworld before the rules were updated the first time. I continue to support the game - it's just that maybe I need to digest it more, and watch from afar for a while. My rating may change in the future.

***

UPDATE 12-7-17

Bumped up my rating back to a 7.5 - the game is as final as it's going to get, and I think all of the hard work from the designer and developer is starting to show. This is definitely one of those games where you need a lot of play, and it takes a lot of thought and pre-planning (especially once the game gets going). The game may be more balanced toward the CSA now, but that was probably inevitable given the vanilla release issues. Still, I find myself still compelled to play. Although the other major titles still have merit (even VG's Civil War, over 30 years later), this is still a great game and a worthy successor.

I have a lot of war games in my collection, and have owned a few hundred over the years, but have never written a comment about one here on BGG. However, I feel compelled to do so for The U.S. Civil War.

This is a TOP quality game: the components are even better than GMT's usual very high standard and are simply excellent - large and thick counters, a beautiful mounted board, and charts and tables on good quality player aid cards.

The rules do require some concentration as there is a lot of detail in here, but I find them very informative and well written, and the examples and map notes are the end are invaluable. In addition, the developer supports the game extremely well on CSW so, once you have the living rules version and the latest clarifications (there is little errata), you should be set to go.

The game once on the table looks fantastic: the board is suitably large, without being crazily so, and presents (to me) the perfect level of detail. Once you have played a turn or two the game plays very smoothly, and presents you with an amazing number of strategic options, all of which seem entirely appropriate to the situation being simulated. As mentioned, there is a lot of detail, but I do not see anything in here that is "chrome for chrome's sake": the game, to me, encompasses everything that is necessary and appropriate to a proper strategic-level military simulation of the civil war.

I used to own both VG's "The Civil War" and GMT's "For the People" upon which this game is based, but I sold them off. I will not be parting with "The U.S. Civil War" under any circumstances if I can help it!

This was my first strategic level Civil War experience. I don't think there is another game that currently has a chance of knocking it from its perch as my go to choice for this scale/genre. There are so many different decisions to make based on army strengths, leader abilities, supply constraints, victory objectives, etc. that it gives the player a unique feeling of actually having to plan how to campaign in the larger scope of the game.

Rules need to be edited and released as a second edition as the errata is extensive, but it is easily playable as is.

This game is apparently getting a ton of grief on CSW; here's a tip: avoid CSW like the plague. That place goes toxic even faster than BGG. Complaints about the rules are totally groundless; this is a very solid rules set, even the somewhat tricky advanced naval rules (which I'm lukewarm on; I'd definitely suggest playing without them at first).

I've played this a number of times now, and I've found TUSCW to be the traditional excellent work that Mark Simonitch does, limited only by the relative weakness of the topic, from a gaming perspective.

I found this to be a vast improvement over both The Civil War and For the People. Mark gives credit to both as inspirations, which is fair, but this is its own game and is far more than just a reworking of those games. Both of them were great ideas with massive problems; this is classic Simonitch, highly playable, graceful and elegant with a great feel for both its topic and how to make it work as an interesting, fun game.

---

Played once - the 1862 scenario - and throughly enjoyed. Do yourself a favor, start with a yearly scenario, 1862 and 1863 seem best, and skip the advanced naval rules. Too many players are jumping in feet first to the campaign game with the full rules and not getting a great experience, which is totally predictable. My experience with the 1862 scenario was great - tense, lots of back and forth, a highly-focused game which throws tough choices at you and doesn't force you do to meaningless micromanagement. The supply rules are a little tricky, but once you get your head around them they're not hard. The game really captures the dynamics of the Eastern theatre in a way that For the People didn't.

I've heard of some people having rules troubles, and while I can't speak for the advanced naval rules, we had only some minimal trouble with them.

---

If you were learning from the last beta of the rules PDF, be sure to read the published rules. They are different in a few important ways.

---

I usually don't think of the US Civil War as a particularly promising gaming subject, especially on the strategic level. But Mark Simonitch is the best, bar none, so I'm actually quite excited to see what he's come up with.

I actually do not share the general fondness people have for the old VG game The Civil War; I felt it was long, overwrought, and with several subsystems that just didn't work very well (the leader management/promotion system was particularly ridiculous, although I understand the gut-level appeal). I think there was something there, although the original was not it, so I'll be curious to see if this can deliver given it's clearly building on that old system.

Love that it's got a mounted map board :)

Stragegia ludo pri "La Usona Enlanda Milito" (1861-1865), unu la plej ampkesaj kaj – laŭ la recenzoj – unu el la plej sukcesaj strategio-simuladoj pri tiu konflikto. 

Oni povas kompari ĉi tiun ludon kun "Senkondiĉa Kapitulacio : la 2-a Mondmilito" de Salvatore Vasta: ambaŭ ludoj havas klarajn regulojn, relevative simplajn mekanismojn, sed ankaŭ implikitajn kaj profundajn strategiajn eblecojn. 

Tamen "La Usona Enlanda Milito" de Mark Simonitch ne reprezentas la politikajn aŭ ekonomiajn kondiĉojn de la milito : se oni deziras lerni pri tiuj perspektivoj, oni elektu la ludon, "For the People" (kiun aŭtoris Mark Herman, kaj kies interna arkitekturo inspiris la dezajnon de Simonitch).

Highly provisional rating.  I played through the 1861 short scenario and it was incredible.  This game has everything I liked about Eric Lee Smith's masterpiece with some sneaky updates.  It will take many plays before I can really rate this game and talk about it intelligently, but this is one of the most promising hex-and-counter wargames I've played in years.  I could see this game surviving in my collection a long time. 

It also seems like it could be really easily adapted for team play.

I've played both VG Civil War and For the People and this is a nice hex/counter blend of those.  I love the leader rules of VG version while GMT's is scripted.  Not fun to play the Conf. as they are playing not to lose too badly, there is no foreign intervention or political points factored into the VP conditions.  Essentially the Union has a vp track that they must keep pace with or they lose.  I may add some house rules to add fun w/leaders such as not removing any and adding casualties.  Game is the most stunning components, map, etc. ever.

Just too much of a simulation for me. The complexity of the rules makes the game too fiddly and not flow smoothly like the lighter wargames I'm used to. And that was without even using the advanced naval rules. And all the rules exceptions regarding the coastal hexes is just ridiculous. 
I prefer the CDG format, event cards, and political will that For the People offers. Because I'd rather just play FtP, I really have no desire to play this one again. The reward to effort payoff just isn't high enough in TUSCW.

RATING: 7
Very tentative rating with one play in so far where I won with the Confederates.

Map is gorgeous, the counters and player aids look great. The rules look great, but keeping up with the errata on CSW has been a drag.

As for actual game play? I'm definitely...undecided. Mechanically, everything seems to be work (at least, with the errata), and we have had some interesting moments. The ebb and flow of the game has felt more or less historically plausible so far, so that's good.

Overall, the game play has been somewhat...flat? I'm not sure how else to describe it, though I don't want to sound too negative just yet. As for specifics, I don't know that I'm a big fan of the cautious general rule (this could have been done better), the basic naval rules (I suspect the advanced naval rules are the way to go), or the General activation rules. There's a tension and flavor the VG game has that seems to have been drained out of this one in the name of simplicity. And, frankly, I don't think it's that much simpler, though it's faster at least.

And, like [i]For the People[/i] and other strategic ACW games, I think the 1861 scenario can be too brittle. This is due to a combination of the low counter density, the Union numerical advantage, the ease with which Generals are activated and rallied, the cards, and the activation system. If the Union gets a series of high activations differentials in the early turns, you could see Richmond fall early. It may only happen once every 4 or 5 games, but that's enough to make me want to start in 1862 for anything but a tutorial session.

UPDATE: Second complete game in, again I win as the Confederates at the end of turn 16. I guess I have to give it a thumbs up at this point, as I wouldn't bother playing that long if I wasn't enjoying myself at some fundamental level. There's lots to like, as you move your forces around the board, making a lot of difficult decisions along the way. Where to attack, who to attack with and how to keep yourself in supply while doing it, all within the confines of the action differential rolls. The Confederate player will spend a good deal of time using his cavalry to cut Union supply lines, while the Union tries opening up other avenues of supply from the soft underbelly of the South via amphibious invasions.

That said, the playing time isn't that much more shorter than the VG game, which is unfortunate, and will probably relegate me to PBEM/Vassal play pretty much exclusively. Plus, the rules weight is a bit heavier than it ought to be, and the errata has gotten a bit out of hand. Most of the rules confusion stems around the river and supply rules, and tracking supply paths can be tiring once you get into the mid to late war stages. But, if you can get your head around them, the payoff is there. It does require regular play, though.

Components and board are just stunning, but unfortunately for me, game play did not match the production values.  Unbalanced and too few forces to play with considering the maneuvering space you have to work with.  Seems it went into production too early.  I understand some of the rule changes have been fixing some of the flaws.  For The People is still my preference between the two.  Maybe I will pick up another edition after it has had a few years to get the bugs worked out.  Some of the mechanics are outstanding.

The game is beautiful. If one could house-rule some of the leader historical entries/deaths, I'm betting that this game would vastly improve for all of those who like to play around with 'what if' scenarios. Otherwise, it's just a matter of how badly the South loses- a simulation. The naval rules elevate this game to a complexity that is not worth it, to me (otherwise good). That being said, this might be the best game at this level of the ACW, but I fear that it won't hit the table much with so many other games calling & such challenging rules.

Update: sold. Played a few times & it becomes too much of a simulation. The North always wins if they deter Southern cavalry raids. How much fun is the Confederate player going to have knowing he has little chance of winning? I suppose 2 players can switch places to see who can pull off a better victory as the North.

RATING: 9
An effective update of Eric Lee Smith's 1983 classic that reduces its complexity (somewhat) and irons out most of its nagging problems. It does lack some of the old design's tension by getting rid of the impulse system. Supply rules are a tad involved. It has some involved naval rules that are getting to be heavy on the errata, but are a must play as the basic naval rules favor the Union far too much. Yet, the rulebook is clear and the design is tried and true. 

One weird thing: leaders do not die in battle. They get replaced and promoted and enter the game on a strict schedule. The idea of reducing overly complicated leader rules is admirable; too many ACW games lavish tons of time because the personalities tower over American military history. Yet, I think Simonitch went too far in the other direction.

Why is John Brannan in the game instead of McCook, Crittenden, Logan, etc? Also, some leader ratings seem off, but when it comes to generalship we split a lot of hairs of Civil War generals. Or should I say facial hairs?

Also, the game is over if McClellan wins the election because he will start peace talks, something he never would have done. 

In the end, this game ranks right up there with Lincoln's War. It is easily among the best in a crowded field populated with classy designs from such venerable men as Smith, Herman, and Poniske.

Fairly good game that really makes you feel like you are operating at the strategic level. Always too much to do and too little to do it with. The game does feel unbalanced for the Confederate player but I guess it's historically accurate in that regard.  Components and map are all very well done. I like the addition of the cards to throw some "spice" into the action rounds. Rules could be cleaned up a bit, but not too bad.

Update-----------------------

I'm still on the fence with this game. The components are great, the map good, and the strategic tension palpable. But I found the rules confusing  I found the river control and corresponding supply rules a constant challenge to wrap my head around and the inability to move 2 & 3 star generals using strategic movement was a constant bone of contention for me.

Just not my game. It has good gameplay and many strategic decisions that make sense with the history I am just not a big fan of civil war games and this one is pretty similar to for the people and if i was going to play a civil war game that would be my choice ahead of this game.

RATING: 6
I wanted a good Civil War, but I prefer something in a smaller scale and not grand operational game, as the rules are long and had to be rewritten. Two naval rules, wasn't working for me. I didn't care for the supply rules or how to figure who controls a river or supply path and a few other things but the components are nice but this game just wasn't for me. So I am still in search of a good Civil War game but I think I'll look for something on a Company or platoon level size. 

I think I may have found what I am looking for with the game called Thunder in the Ozarks.

RATING: 8
My first game of this type and hence it was a bit difficult to grasp the game play at first. After some testing I'm however surprised as how logic and relatively smooth it is.

Elegant design. I'm not so concerned about how historically correct the game is. That's probably because I'm European, which doesn't make this particular war that important. On the other hand few games about European or even world wars are particularly accurate, since they usually adopt to our western dogmas, twisting the purpose of some famous events. Back to TUSCW: to "win" as the South still means playing unhistorical to beat history.

Maybe I'll need to trade it, not because I don't like it, but I have no one to play with and it takes too long time.

Despite its many flaws, Eric Lee Smith's Civil War is one of my all-time favorite games.  The US Civil War brilliantly builds upon that foundation, fixes all its flaws, and adds an amazingly elegant card mechanic that creates a tense decision space for the allocation of resources to generate game effects that play a pivotal roll in the game and simulate those unusual or rare events, such as forced marches, well-planned campaigns, and amphibious invasions, that often shifted the course of the war.  On top of all of this, the production quality of the game is amazing with a map that is both gorgeous and loaded with amazing historical detail.  This game does not attempt to replace For the People and its political/strategic will mechanisms. Instead, at its heart, The US Civil War is a strategic and operational war game.  In that space, it immediately becomes the standard by which all others will be judged.  Simply brilliant.

Mark Simonitch's "US Civil War" is to the canon of Civil War themed games, what "Shelby Foote's The Civil War: A Narrative," is to the canon of Civil War literature. It's epic and well designed. Still, I would prefer to play A House Divided with the historical optional rules.

RATING: 9
Edit: Pretty provisional '9', I have only played solo. Still, I think this one is destined to be a classic, played many years from now. (and I suspect there will be some common house rules applied down the line, as players learn to exploit the game, very much like the old Victory Games classic) It feels like the ACW to me. I especially love the genius supply rules and the river/ water movement rules, as much a PITA as the latter are to internalize. I think about this one all the time when I'm not playing, so that earns a 9 from me.

Just received, no comment other than it's eye popping. Takes a different angle than the awesome For The People, in that it's about the military conflict, and doesn't really attempt to cover the politics. I have such a buzz anticipating playing this. The map is simply amazing. I know mounted maps aren't everyone's preference, but thanks so much to Mark S. and GMT for the mounted boards in this one. It really adds a lot for me.

A marriage of Victory Games' "The Civil War" combined with GMT's "For the People" makes for one awesome off-spring! It has the depth of play of the VG game without the side stuff like the Far West theater which nobody ever paid attention to anyway. It also doesn't have some of the gamey aspects of FtP which experienced gamers mercilessly utilize. 

I have only played a couple of scenarios but I am already sold. This is the American Civil War game I have been waiting over thirty years for. It blows everything else out of the water.

For the past 15 years I've had a game of VGCW going on-line almost without pause.  This is the first game I've seen in over 20 years that could tear me away from that classic title.

Update - Had to revise this down, unfortunately.  I find the level of scripting intrusive on the feel of the game.  The naval rules are at war with themselves and while the developer has taken on and performed herculean tasks he's (justifiably) interested more in settling matters within the existing rules rather than continuing to revise and improve the game.

I could end up rating this anywhere from 8 to 10. But won't yet.

Impressive first three plays.

Overall, it's a very refined wargame with a focus on using the detailed map geography and your 'supply trains' carefully. My only concern (apart from the huge game length) is how random it can be, as a long-pondered strategy can quickly evaporate with a bad dice roll. Also, the retreat rolls give the escapees a lot of latitude about where they flee to, which can be a frustrating 'reset' buttno that makes you wish you'd never attacked in the first place.

I should first admit that I still find the rulebook frustrating (even the latest May 2017 'near final edit'). It contains many rules exceptions and a lot of cross-referencing to other sections. If you can assemble 20 bits of flatpack furniture, you can handle this - because that's what learning the rules might feel like.

The map is a big, beautiful treasure trove of possibilities including detailed terrain with endless logistical opportunities. It even includes niche historical (and playable) details like where the Confederate saltmines can be blocked.

This is a pure wargame but it remembers to reflect the politics of the War. It intentionally abstracts the politics, so that players can focus entirely on logistics and manoeuvre. In particular, there are interesting 'border state' challenges and there is a lot of pressure on the Union player to make quick progress.

There is a healthy ebb and flow to the game, reflecting seasonal weather changes and including semi-regular clean-up phases where you can reinforce and reconfigure your forces. Players receive a slow supply of random, secret cards that contribute to the flow because they typically bolster attacks unexpectedly etc. I love the way that expending your last card (until you eventually get more) is a risky decision that makes you more predictable - allowing your enemy to relax a bit.

It's interesting how the Confederates always get to do their strategic repositioning phases after the Union phases, so are usually more able to react quickly and make the most of their inferior numbers ... albeit being inferior on sweeping naval movements etc.

Randomness seems set at the right level. A trickle of randomness tends only to become crucial in big breakthrough battles. Trying to decide when to fight creates delicious tension because, unlike most boardgames, there are no 'catch-up mechanisms' to help the loser back to their feet.

The only peculiarly abstract design in this otherwise very thematically logical game is how the various generals will appear, die, get promoted etc at their historically pre-ordained times. Thankfully it isn't entirely abstract: they can still be relocated to 'sectors' where they never fought (in real life); players still chose wherea they appear within the designated sector; and they can be knocked out of the game for a while if their army is destroyed. It can still be a chore to plan for their arrival - but maybe it will become a fun thing once I've played more and are more familiar with them.

This is one of the most entertaining historical simulation games I've played, and I've been enjoying war-games since c. 1968 when I discovered the old Avalon Hill game, Stalingrad, at a local hobby store. Here are the features of The US Civil War that I think are outstanding:
• wonderfully interesting, high quality mounted map designed with the supply rules in mind; its fun to study on its own, and I've never seen a game like this that has done a better job of melding the logistical rules of the game with the map design in order to recreate the historical strategic dynamics that shaped the civil war campaigns. 
• fascinating variable action phase system augmented by special action theatre of operation cards
• original reaction movement and initiative mechanisms
• love the combat results system, which takes into account force size and generals, and does a wonderful job of reflecting historical-like outcomes
• terrific job on the rulebook; enjoyed reading it, good examples; minimal special case rules, so once the system is understood players can concentrate on strategy without worrying much about what they might have forgotten
• really enjoy the designer notes, comments, and discussions concerning some of the map areas
• strengths and weaknesses of both sides are well modeled; e.g., Southern generalship vs Northern numerical superiority
• clever victory point system that keeps the pressure on the North to maintain an offensive posture, which in a simple way models the political driver that forced many of the strategic decisions during the war. 

The result is a game that does a masterful job of delivering a strategic level view of the civil war that provides a little insight into why the war unfolded as it did. The civil war as portrayed here is very highly abstracted to make for a fun game, while maintaining overall historical outlines. It's an impressive achievement of balance.

[1 play] I try to follow the BGG scale with my ratings. I could probably give this an 8 if it were not for the length of the game and the phrase that I would "never turn down a game". I would. This is a game that you have to have the time and the mindset to be ready to play. It is an investment to learn, there's a cost to my enjoyment looking up stuff too frequently be it rules or CRTs, and it will always be a big chunk of time.

Disclaimers done, I liked it quite a bit. It is well thought out. The map is amazingly beautiful and I think I could help someone understand a great deal about the ACW just going over everything the map takes into consideration.

I had fun learning this and I will enjoy going deeper on my next play.

Initial rating based on two scenarios and an ongoing campaign game as the Union.  It's a superb game for the Union.  If it's as good to play as the CSA than I'd up my rating to a 10.  It's remarkable in recreating both sides' dilemmas.  I'll update this upon further play. 

After several plays I lowered my rating BUT I'm aware that Jim Dauphinais' revision of the rules set repaired the problems we found.  Since those are addressed, I removed my rating as it surely should rise with Jim's fixes.

How can a game go from "instant classic" to the poster boy for house rules?  CSW game folder is a cess pool of vitriol, designer is an absentee landlord, lucklily the developer is doing a good job of carrying the burden. 

How did this turkey make it to release without the full campaign being properly playtested?  What strategic ACW gamer doesn't play full campaign starts??  

I don't appreciate having to pay to playtest, even if the playtest kit has a mounted map.

TUSCW is NOT VG's Civil War reimagined, and little of the innovation of FtP is here either.  The one redeeming feature of this sorry excuse for a "new classic", is I totally appreciate what finely crafted masterpiecs FtP and VG CW really are.

I don't know maybe it's me,  it's just not sinking in on this game.  Maybe I like tactical more than this big strategic level game.  I will give it another chance, but for know I am putting it away until I read a play through or until someone posts a play though on you tube.  I haven't given up on it, but having it sit on my table for the last 3 1/2 to 4 weeks without much happening trying to figure it out,  I've had enough for now.

Rating likely to go up after more plays

Impressions. First and foremost, I learned quite a bit about the Civil War from the game. I did not realize how important the West was and really was where the war was won. Sure the battles in the east get the renown - but they felt more like two elephants pushing on each other not getting anywhere. Secondly, I did not realize how complete the blockage was.

On the game itself. Very much like it - there is a very "puzzle" feel to conguering the south. i.e. to Capture Chattanooga, you need to force the Rebel TN army to move - and in order to do that, you need to capture Pulaski and in order to do that..... So each turn was spent thinking about what level I was going to push to force. As the South, I definitely started to feel the attrition - by Fall, It felt like I was just barely scraping forces together to respond to Union threats - and could see 1964 being a rough year (The Carolinas and GA were pretty much open).

I do need to get better at:

1) Attacking with large stacks - not sure of the magic here - but I never felt like I was using the large stacks right - they felt more useful as deterrents (the only way to win is not to play (aka attack). Further, I could not see how I could get to Gettysburg as the South without some damn lucky rolls.

2) Cavalry - I dont think I used them correctly. Every time I would cut LOC, the other side was able to bring up a force and cut its LOC - making avoiding battle moot. (likely misplaying rules here)

3) Invasions - and perhaps this is simply a historically accurate thing - but the only time I was successful in invading was Galveston/Houston. Everywhere else was cut off and crushed

4) Use of the Navy - and perhaps this is because the Rebels had very little navy left. It just seemed like an excuse to get +1 DRM.

Definitely a keeper and will play again.

A bit like Empire of the Sun in that you must learn the geography and supply rules over repeated plays before being able to play strategically. I'm still in the learning phase, and each time you end up impressed by the design. The turn setup and accounting slow things down, but combat and movement are fairly quick. Love the sweep of the narrative and how the designer has held close to theme. Battle results with demoralization and attrition feel about right.

Awesome. The operational game to have on the entire US Civil War. Keystone wargame - it takes a hell of an effort to supplant an epic classic - VG's TCW - this does it.

My VG Civil War game will now have an honored retirement.

Really want to like this, but the May 2017 rules changes have really put me off.  It's not that the changes are that horrible, but I get the sense that they will just create other issues that will make the game less fun, e.g. South can't build forts in West because of only one card drawn per turn.

Mark Simonitch has taken all the best features from the old Victory Games "Civil War", thrown in some concepts from "For the People" and taken into account all of the strategic Civil War games that have come before. This is the best simulation currently available that covers the entire war. A 'masterpiece'. 

Update: Spring 2017 - With the new updated rules the game has corrected some of the historical 'anomalies' that could result from over active Union naval activity. I'm playing it now with the new rules and it is a much better game and simulation.

The play balance seems more even, but I would need to play more games, as both sides, before I could change my score. I still think it is the best strategic game covering the entire war, but, the game will always bear the scars of having needed more development time. However, this does not take away from the game in any manner.

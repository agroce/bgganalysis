A silly family style roll and move game with a bluffing twist.  I like it fine enough but I have several games that fill the same requirement that I like more.  The reason I still have it is my parents and girlfriend enjoy it and wanted to keep it around.

Light roll and move type family game. Kind of a kitchen sink design with roll and move, bluffing and a dexterity element throw in as well. Let's see how many different game mechanics we can shoehorn into this game! But it works fairly well. It usually takes a couple of games for the bluff element to really sink in with non-gamers and young kids though. But the game is light, quick and fun.

Because of the period the game came out and the use of pokerdice, nuggets and theme, this game looked a bit like dice town. But although the game has a lot of the same elements as dice town, it isn't far from as good. The poker element could have been better if there was an element of giving the pokerdice to the next player and had to decide if the hand was right or not. Then there would have been a much bigger competition element. So it should be fun, but that did not work here.

For as silly of a game as this is, it's got a TON of technicalities.

"wait, so if I'm in jail, does this mean..."

"So, the card says..."

"Wait, if I'm ahead, it's two gold to reroll in the desert, but if you're in last place, the first re-roll is free...."

I'm sure no one actually plays this game right, because it's not a thick euro.  It's supposed to be bluffing and calling BS on everyone.   

02-03-12: Some rules addendums.  

*Everyone should get a chance to win this.  Not just the two dueling, or the one that sails to the end.  So whoever gets there and duels, still has to move normally.

*Two gold in the desert to reroll is so much of a hack anyway, this one is the first to go in streamlining the rules.

*People get to move within their space however they want before a duel.

A ridiculuous amalgamation of mechanics.
- Poker dice where the hands form movement/scoring opportunities
- Expenditure of Gold for rerolls
- Bluffing Mechanics that only penalize you for calling someone out and being wrong
- Using the dice as marbles in mini-shoot outs

Overall this was an extremely annoying game and when we starting playing 'bowling for Indians' I was pretty much done.

Nothing made me happier than not being in the final two players who then spent five minutes shooting at each other until one of them 'won'.

Never again

RATING: 4
A race game with poker dice. Looks very much like Dice Town.

The dice rolling and bluffing part was done much better in Bluff IMHO. Dueling and fighting Indians (or rather Native Americans) is rather innovative and can be silly fun, however in a kind of "Carcassonne the Catapult way". 

We played  with 3, but the game might be better with more players.

In a nutshell, there seems to be not too much influence on the outcome of the game, but it might be a fun drinking game with the right cowd and at least 4 players (and it seems, the authors might have been drinking while developing, too ;-)).

This was a pleasant surprise.  Playful them that flies in the face of the PC crowd.  

I enjoy the way the dice are used to create poker hands. But the thing that makes the game really fun is the role of bluffing and someone calling your bluff. 

I'd like to trade for a copy.  This works great as a light, fun, family game.

Coloratissimo e molto divertente!
Molto simpatici ed originali i duelli e la sfida agli indiani.
Diciamo che è un gioco di percorso con una forte componente di bluff ed anche destrezza nei tiri per colpire l'avversario.
Da il suo meglio in 5 giocatori.
Nel suo genere lo reputo una perla.
Consigliato! 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Durante la partita di Pony Express quasi muoio dalle risate. Giuro piegato in due!!!   Lisci clamorosi nei duelli, bluff, contro bluff, controcontro bluff.... 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
provato insieme a Sava e i suoi due pargoli, credevo fosse un gioco per bambini... ed invece è risultato molto divertente per tutti! Grande ambientazione, bella la grafica; dare la schicchera al dado per colpire gli indiani di turno oppure il rivale in duello è divertentissimo.

Sounds outstanding.  I'm imagining something with the same general feel as Jamaica, with the added element of bluffing!  Dice + push-your-luck + bluffing + flicking + cowboys = home run for my lunch group.  #1 on my wish list right now.

UPDATE: Bought it, played it, and it's just as fun as I hoped.

RATING: 9
This game fell a little bit short of my expectations. I didn't realize just how much the game hinges on the bluffing elements. And because of that it doesn't have that Pull-And-Play elements that I really desire from games. It takes a little bit for new players to first learn the game, then practice a bit and then feel comfortable enough to start bluffing and then comfortable enough with their opponents to start trying to call bluffs. Now all that said, I do really love the game and want to play it some more. It is simple, straight forward and one of the few bluffing games that I really like which is a genre that doesn't appeal to me that much.

2015-07-28 : Fun & silly bluffing/dexterity style game with some tactical depth - poker players do have an advantage in this game

RATING: 5
It's got hardly any bluffing, big runaway leader problem and unbalanced cards (most cards are pretty worthless except for the move X spaces cards). Pretty much a game for 8-year olds as it says on the box but nothing to appeal to adults.

However, there are two cool things about this game - the dice and the "shooting" mechanism of cowboys and Red Indians. It's an interesting mix of carrom with playing pieces as obstacles - silly but in a kinda fun way.

Wow!  Opened this up, and thought, "This is Dice Town!"  These very same components are used in Dice Town: cup, dice, gold nuggets.  The cowboy games both have Indians (Dice Town's expansion), and both take place in a Wild West town.  Graphics are not that dissimilar.  However, both the designers and the publishers are different.  

It's different!  We had a lot of fun--duels & shootings are dexterity matches with dice!  Bluffing with poker dice is a major part of the game. Penalties are numerous and often result in Jail Time!!! 

Really great wooden Indians & cowboys.  Rules are easy and the game is quick.  We played with 3, which was fun--but it is obvious to us that 5 players will be a blast.

Jogo bem light e festivo. Cada jogador deve rolar 5 dados e tentar fazer uma combinação, estilo poker, onde cada uma delas permite andar uma quantidade de espaços no caminho. Estes dados são rolados secretamente, então outros jogadores podem duvidar do jogador. No caminho tem uma série de eventos: pegar cartas com poderes especiais, pegar um trem, minerar uma pepita de ouro, avançar no caminho, duelar com outros cowmboys e enfrentar índios. Este dois últimos ocorrem dando um peteleco nos dados tentando acertar os adversário do outro lado do tabuleiro.
Um legitimo filler.

It gets major props for trying to have a bunch of wildly different mechanics involved.  Ultimately, it is a simple race game.  The dexterity elements make the game if you are in the right mood for chaotic fun.  Unfortunately, the treatment of native Americans in this game is offensive, plain and simple (and I don't get offended easily).  You "shoot" them for money and bribed them with liquor.  No cool.  A bizarre game that I would probably pass on next time.

This is a race to the finish game where bluffing is the main mechanic of the game with some dexterity thrown in for some silly fun and laughs.

This is a great game to bring out with some friends for some light silly fun. Everyone I have played it with thus far has had a great time playing. Game play is around an hour give or take a little depending on the amount of players. The game components are very nice and very similar if not the same as some of the components from Dice Town. Though they look similar the game play is completly differnt.

The dexterity part of the game. Where you get to flick dice at other players (shoot out) or flick at the indians fits well into the theme of the game and is a lot of fun.

There's nothing heavy about this game. It is just a very fun light game to be played with family/friends or the party crowd. I recommend giving this a try if you get the chance. There's a lot of fun and laughs to be had with this one.

A little too long for its own good, though I suppose experience with the game would speed it up a bit.

I like the bluffing element as well as the dice bowling part, which feels thematic and is wacky enough to be fun, but still requires a bit of skill to do well.

I am a little troubled by the restrictions on who can call the player's bluff, as in my experience it is quite risky to call out another player, and we seemed to avoid it more often than I'd like.

Not the type of game you play all the time, but every once in a while, with the full complement of players, it's a lot of fun!

Mettiamola cosi: E' un gioco dell'oca, in cui si avanza in funzione di quale combinazione di Poker riuscirete a far uscire dai dadi (si esatto, i dadi hanno i simboli delle carte da poker).
E' un gioco di bluff e smascheramenti perchè i vostri avversari non vedranno tutti i vostri dadi e voi potrete cercare di truffarli... ma se vi scroprono si muoveranno al posto vostro...
Fighissime le sfide che si creano quando due cowboy si incontrano nello stesso posto.
Ci sono zone apposite dove metterli e bisogna "sparare" letteralmente prendendo a schicchere il dado.
Stessa tipologia di sfida contro i gruppi di indiani.
Insomma se vi piace il poker, il bluff e le sfide questo è un bel giochino da fare in 40-60 minuti...

Pony Express riders in a race from Missouri to California! Pros: lots of laughs and take-that, great cartoony artwork (think Yosemite Sam), interesting poker dice/bluffing upgrade to the old roll-and-move mechanic. Works better with four than three players (more duels, more innocent bystanders in the way during duels and injun shootouts). Cons: Quite chaotic, lots of fussy little rules and exceptions, a little too long for what it is. Ultimately not my kind of game. [2 plays; sold]

Thanks to this game, my six-year-old now knows the difference between a full house and a straight, has beaten the Indians (red meeples, naturally) using the 'firewater' card, and can look me in the eye and tell me she has a four-of-a-kind when in fact she has just two pair.  She absolutely loves it.  Me?  I'm going to hell.  

I ordered the German edition from amazon.de.  No issues playing with the English printed card translation sheet from BBG.

Game where the winner might get to be decided in a dexterity showdown match cannot be bad, right? Pony Express is a combination of racing, bluffing and dexterity game. The game is chaotic, random and really fun.

Movement is decided with poker dice: You can reroll them if you pay and naturally you can try to outbluff your opponents. If that backfires, the opponent gets to move. If two players get into a same square, then they have a duel which is naturally solved by having cowboy meeples on the corners of board and by flicking dice towards opponent trying to hit him... 

There is some charm with this game even though it really shouldn't be type of a game I usually like. One good thing is that games have taken 45-60 minutes with 5 or 3 new players so it is fast enough game for this type and doesn't get to feel too long. It's a very fun game.

Most of the components are the same as in Dice Town. The added components, i.e. the indianeeples, are very cute. The bluffing part works, as does the outrageously silly dexterity part, but as a game this just isn't as interesting as Dice Town.

A race game with mechanics borrowed from Ciao Ciao and Crokinole!? Roll your poker dice secretly. Either roll a good poker hand or lie about you rolled, because the better the hand, the further you'll move along the race track. The player closest to you on the track gets to call or not, with penalties for getting caught or getting it wrong. Spaces on the race track offer different rewards (re-roll tokens, etc) so you might try and call something innocuous to land on a reward that will help. If you land on another player, or on an Indian square, you shoot a puck from one corner of the board at a target on the opposite corner, shooting around the tokens on the race track in the centre, for reward and penalty (miss a turn). Which sounds like fun, and it is for the first little while, but it gets repetitive fast and there's no depth. The only replay might come if people are looking for something weird and are happy to play something mindless for 45 minutes. I guess there's a market for that, but not much of one in my house.

I didn't believe this combination of dexterity and bluffing could work. Well, it does.
Don't take this as a very serious boardgame. No, it is tactical bluff and a portion of luck.

A totally hilarious light game with all the essential components to have fun in a group: wacky dice, dexterity and luck. Probably the best "party game" so far, easy to teach and play. Length is also good, since it takes something like an hour to play it. The more the merrier.

The box is unnecessarily large. Half of the current would've sufficed... 

Really great game, btw!

I think that unfortunately this design may become a victim of the right attitude and translation hurdles experienced in my first play with four. 

By right attitude I'm referring to the possible need to assess what actions/events you desire which fall within the movement range for your meeeple BEFORE rolling the dice in order to get an exciting emotional payoff with the dice result. However, instinctively the dice are rolled first (hard to overcome if you are regular Bluff player) then the table of results is referred to which slows down the calls and may be 'telling' as to whether you've pulled off the necessary roll, though the latter aspect can be used to fool the opponent.

Couple with this assessment of the favourable spots to land on is the translation hurdles: firstly players need to know the iconography, so unfortunately this makes the game intro too wordy instead of being just a few rules and getting into the game. This wordiness won't bother the players and gamers (but I don't they think would tolerate the design) but will probably put off the casual players/family (the intended audience I suspect) which is a real shame as the game has genuine fun aspects in the bluffing and fun spectacle in the 'crokinole' parts.(My first example shot and injury put the fear and chuckles into my opponents, and my massacre of the injuns won't be forgotten so easily).

The other translation issue is if the casual/family player isn't familiar with the poker hierarchy then again this is another aspect to consolidate into the right attitude (along with the space iconography and resolution) to quickly enjoy the first impression, because I believe the game warrants a place in the collection as it brings something different to the table.
I think the game may shine with just 3 players, reducing the incident of imprisoning bad shooters as well as turn order being quicker.

Overall once the hurdles are overcome I think PE is very well themed and has the potential to have more long term fun and subtlety than Bluff, which I was hoping I would no longer need (guess Bluff will still stay to provide an 101 guide to keeping straight faced as well as catering for 4 - 6 players). I also like the catch up mechanics (the 3 spaces in Sacramento and free first rerolls for last) even though explaining them becomes verbose.

I would have liked less exceptions to many rules you have to explain but fingers crossed the visual and physical fun will ensure another play with casual/family player who aren't turned off by the wordiness of the game and the contents of this comment box.

Cute and fast with significant luck. Not much room for lying compared to Liar's Dice'. The price to get-out-of-jail should perhaps be reduced to 2 gold.

I'd play again but don't need to own.

PS: I LOVE the 'political incorrectness' of the game because of the people who will get irate so they can rail against a silly parody of the 'Old West'.

Juego bastante flojete y caro... 36 euros de puro aire. 

La única gracia del juego son los duelos... y poco más. A su favor debo decir que es de los pocos juegos que yo creo que pueden funcionar bien jugando a beber con chupitos ya que las situaciones dan pie a ello y además aumenta la dificultad de mentir en las tiradas y de apuntar en los duelos.

No creo que el juego salga mucho a mesa salvo cuando queramos beber. Sin lugar a dudas es mucho mejor y divertido su hermano Dice Town.

You just don't see games like this anymore. Probably for good reason. The theme is a bit offensive at times, and you're always chasing down game pieces. It feels like a flashback to those wacky hasbro games from the 90s. Still, I give this high ratings for unique dexterity elements and the hilarious player interraction.

Uma grande paródia, um jogo que foge ao controlo do jogador, mas que é esse mesmo o objectivo dos autores, ou seja, não é um jogo muito técnico, é ideal para relaxar um bocado e dar umas gargalhadas, com uma enorme pitada de bluff e/ou de sorte, ou não fosse um derivado do poker de dados...

One of the better recent yatzy-related dice games. The innovative dexterity mechanic which is used to solve the duels is great. The bluff element for declaring the poker hands works well as thematic element. Had fun playing and looking forward playing again.

With the right family crowd this might be an okay game. It's a cross between Liars Dice and Crokinole, but with a sudden end and a ton of downtime. Not for me, but might be fun with a suitable gaming crowd.

TRADED FOR Shadows over Camelot, The Village, Innovation

I actually thought this game was Dice Town when I bought it, having a similar box and design and the mechanics were close. I was pleasantly surprised to find it added a dexterity aspect to the game with gun fights and killing Indians. The bluffing mechanic is still there which is why I bought the game to start with, we get a kick out of it. A few of the cards are totally overpowered and usually the person who draws the most of them ends up winning but that doesn't stop us from playing.

A fun game but not sure the board position makes it any more fun than Liars Dice. Also, the gunfighting, poker game, and Indians play a much smaller role than I thought. EDIT: Played again and this time the gun fighting played a much bigger role meaning the game was much more fun. So fun that I used expletives I usually reserve for hitting my thumb with a hammer!

It's got some interesting dice-rolling and bluffing, like Liar's Dice, but also with an object of racing across the board.  You do also use the dice to try to hit objects on the board, so it's got a dexterity element.  It's good for some light fun and while it's a bit long for what it is, I do admire the unique blend of mechanics.

Enjoyable family game that my kids enjoyed a lot due to the duels and shooting the Indians. Add a dexterity element to any game and my kids will like it. I think this game would shine with more people (more duels) and, with the bluffing element, adults should enjoy the game as well. Very nice components. I love the artwork as well.

Pony Express shares art and componentry with the more widely distributed Dice Town, but Pony Express is the better game.  Both attempt to be fun filler, but Pony Express froths with silliness and even adds an occasional dexterity exercise.  Bluffing on poker dice is an unexpected source of comedy but it works.

I've played this twice.  The first time, I jacked up the rules in a major way, and three of us ended up rotting in jail for most of the game.  It was not fun.

The second time, though, with the rules correctly played, it was a weird and very enjoyable game.  Luck, bluffing, and dexterity--wha?  Yeah, and even a sliver of strategy thrown in for good measure.  It is worth a play just for the novelty alone, and is a pretty distraction.  The one knock against it is that it can run just a bit long for what it is.

Nothing will stop you on your quest for speed and victory, neither the Indians lying in wait, nor the pretty saloon girls who want to charm the gold from your pockets. You're the best, the wildest, the quickest and the luckiest rider in the land... At least you think you are - but all the other riders feel the same, so watch your back and get moving! Be the first to grab gold from the mines, duel opponents in savage gunfights or beat them at the poker table, and use your brains, bluffing skills and equipment to clear the way to Sacramento and deliver your precious letters.
Whether you ride like the wind or eat dust on the trail, this game will be wild!

Didn't really do it for me. Took the jail mechanism from Monopoly(Bad choice). The poker symbols on the board are too hard to read. 

Only fun thing about this game, was the dexterity part. Trying to kill indians or other cowboys but flicking a die at the was silly fun. Other than that, not fun

Lanza los dados y anuncia tu mano (de poker). Si no te pillan en un bluff avanzas según lo que permita la mano anunciada. Ataca a los indios, extrae oro, visita el salón (paga tu consumo), roba cartas, toma el ferrocarril, bátete a duelo). Gana quien llegue primero con la correspondencia a Sacramento.

GAME: Deadlands: Doomtown
RANK: 1642
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've got unplayed decks for several factions. Cards cross all releases. Some Jokers
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very entertaining mix of Magic and Poker.  There are a few weaknesses that stem from it being an early TCG (hard to tell card type, set, or rarity, for example) but it is still very fun.  If only the cards were easier to come by.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A great CCG with lots of interesting deck strategies and an awesome mechanic that involves creating poker hands with your deck to resolve gunfights.  However, the game does have a few drawbacks.  A "turtling" strategy where one player simply avoids fighting at all costs is feasible in this game and is not fun to play against (or even with).  Also, because the victory condition is based on which characters each player has out, a disastrous result for one player can end in a single turn win for an opponent.  This can be avoided, but the game does have a very wide range of play times, from only a few minutes to several hours (if you stick it out that long).

Update 9-26-2015: The original has been entirely replaced by the new Doomtown Reloaded.  I don't feel the need to play this version ever again.

It's fun as a game, the poker mechanisms are fun and well integrated into the game. I'm also a sucker for shared area control in CCGs.
Unfortunately its collectable...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is an odd little game.  The first time I played it was confusing.  Combined with bad strategy on my part and a terrible card distribution = not a lot of fun.  The second time, I shifted my initial strategy, got a sweet draw, and did pretty well.
It's an odd concept: combining poker with an old west card theme, but it's kind of fun.  It's not one I'd seek to purchase, but it's one that I could certainly play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
There are some really interesting mechanics in this game but I've come to dislike any ccg where you play locations and move around between them. I don't think it plays to the strength of the ccg format to do so. I didn't play a lot but it seemed like there were some really unbalanced cards.

Best CCG ever! Great setting and great mechanics. Best just to use the first 9 releases if playing for fun, some balance issues with the last few sets. Always checking eBay to add to my collection.

A weird setting, but the poker combat makes sure you really do have to think about deck contruction and strategies in the game. A nice story arc, but one which went on for too long.

I played this a couple times but didn't like it.  I love Deadlands, and I love Magic and V:tES, but I found few CCG game designs compelling.  I used the cards to make a kick-ass art-filled poker deck.

This is another spawn of the golden era of CCGs, with a very unusual theme and a clever and intriguing combat system based on poker hands. I had only a quick experience with it at the end of its life, but it was interesting enough to make me desire to play it again sometimes...

Shootout at High Noon
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Doomtown is my favourite CCG. It has a build-your-own-board aspect, nearly combining a CCG with a boardgame (but not quite). The game uses poker hands as its combat mechanic, and all cards (except the joker) have both a value and a suit.

Though decks can be creative featuring duplicate cards, and stacking is an important mechanic for some styles of play, I've found I prefer to play the game with bicycle decks - one each of A-K for all four suits, and two jokers if you've got 'em. It feels like a better game to me - less gimmmicky and cheesy.

Doomtown was innovative for its time, but I haven't played any CCGs since, and don't know how well it's stood up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A pretty good CCG with great theme and some cool mechanics based on poker; unfortunately, it's a CCG...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
If it wasnt a CCG then it would get a higher rating (possibly a 9) - game breaks with some events, so best to play with decks only allowing 1 of any card, or even better a legal poker deck (1 each card/suit)

Looking for offers of full USPS fixed-price shipping boxes of cards.  This would be approximately 2,800 - 3,000 cards.  Offered lots should include at least 1 rare per 15 cards.
Only interested in cards from the following sets:  Boot Hill, Ashes to Ashes, and Eye for an Eye sets.

Can be combined with cards from other titles in which I am interested to get a full shipping box (but should still have an appropriate number of Rare cards).  

Will bulk trade my MtG cards at 1:3 (1 of my MtG cards for 3 of your Doomtown cards).

I have the "Shootout at High Noon" intro set.  The rules are somewhat difficult to understand, but that's probably because I have never played any CCGs before.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of the best CCGs ever to be designed. What to mention first? The genius idea of doing combat (shootouts) via poker and seeing how many people the losing team lost by what difference there is between the poker hands? The chess-like maneuvering aspects? The multifaceted deckbuilding where you need to balance between cards you put in as well as their values which will decide what poker hands you make? The fact that players cannot lose, but only win, making this a perfect multiplayer card game?

No two ways about it, one of the most ingenious and enjoyable CCGs ever created. If you can't find any cards or people to try it out with, then come join us online in OCTGN (http://dbzer0.com/blog/doomtown-on-octgn ) and you won't regret it.

RATING: 9
This is one of my top 5 CCGs of all time. It's set in the "Weird West" Deadlands universe, which means Wild West...but with Hexes and Gyrocopters and Mutants! It has a very innovative and perfectly thematic method of handling shootouts, using the suits shown in the corner of every card. Each player draws five cards of the top of the deck and this number is modified by the number of posse members utilized from adjacent locations. The player that makes the best poker hand from these cards, wins the shootout. The great thing is that you can actually cheat and pull like 5 aces, but if the opponent has a cheatin' card, you're busted. There are some really creative cards in the set, as a whole, but the starter decks were pretty weak and sometimes unbalanced. Love this game, though.

I've mostly played with the preconstructed decks but the game seemed ok, almost like a mix between LBS and 7th Sea. A bit longish in the build-up phase which made the game feel a bit tedious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Based on theme and creative ideas [poker hands combat resolution, cheating, low-hand initiative, etc] injected into the game, this would be the Greatest Game Ever Made. But sometime between opening up the packs and awarding the title we'll need to evaluate how the game plays, which is in a word 'predictable'. The tired resource system, the myriad of distracting little abilities, and predictable buildup of forces to a huge curtain-dropping finale have been done, done and done. It is a shame to waste such amazing ideas on such a flawed foundation, but there it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The best ccg I've played (and I've played way too many). The poker mechanic used to decide shootouts is great fun and fits wonderfully with the theme. If there is any justice this game will return to print in the future.

The rulebook doesn't do all that great of a job of explaining some of the game concepts.  The conflict resolution is neat, using elements of Poker.  Some of the factions (Sweetrock, for example) were a little unbalanced at first, and have since been revised.

This is my all-time favorite CCG and the only one that really managed to clamp onto my wallet like a lamprey.  You control a small cadre of colorful Weird West characters who vie for control of the California settlement, Gommorah.  The settings, fiction, and characters were solid and the evolution of the game was great.

Unfortunately it was undone by a switch to a punishing rarity scheme halfway through its run, and by the bewildering database of errata that one had to maintain for high-end play.  I have trouble even recalling the basic rules these days, but I still remember the names and abilities of my favorite characters!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
An excellent game with a solid mix of creative combat mechanics, strategic character movement, and resource management.  The ultra-cool Deadlands theme doesn't hurt, either!  Speaking of the theme, Doomtown has to be one of the most thematic card games ever; you truly do feel like you're controlling a band of Wild West misfits as they vie for control of a toxic town in the middle of a wasteland.  While playing Doomtown, I've been known to twiddle my mustache, evilly.

One caveat with Doomtown is that it tends to overwhelm new players, who in turn spend most of the game turtling on their home deed and drawing the game out to a slow anticlimax.  The benefits of an active, aggressive play style aren't immediately obvious to those unfamiliar with Doomtown's mechanics.  For experienced card-floppers looking for something immensely creative, though, it doesn't get any better than Doomtown.  

RIP, Doomie!

I have played a couple of games of the CCG and it has significant appeal.  I like theme and the deck construction possibilities where ever card has primary function and counts in random poker hands.  The gameplay lends itself to many different strategies and can be very tactical.  It suffers from the problems of all CCGs, person with most cards wins ETC.  Also the barrier to entry is pretty high you need lots of cards to build a coherent deck and the game appears to be out of print.

RATING: 10
This is the GREATEST CCG ever created!  It is, by far, my favorite & is the reason why I never played MAGIC: T.G. again.  The story driven expansions is what killed it (this also happened to 7TH SEA CCG) & the release of the PINEBOX editions didn't help either.  But with all this put aside, the game is brilliant!  The use of poker hands as a combat mechanic is genius & the deck limit of 52 cards (like a standard poker deck) is another stroke of originality which puts this CCG at the TOP of my list of must haves!  I have thousands of cards & almost EVERY faction which was released to make sessions different everytime.

This game has a great mechanic where fighting was determined through playing hands of poker.  It works so well with the theme and is a lot of fun.  It also adds a lot of strategy to deck building.

I SO wish there was a non-collectible variation to this game. It's just so dang-blasted fun. I love card games where the cards act as two things: in this case, the poker hand and the actual nouns/verbs running around the town. Great representation of the western 'high noon' stereotypes. Yeehah!

I'm embarrassed to admit that I became obsessed with collecting all the cards, and I won't tell you how much I spent on it.  But I got down to having every card except two Promos, and I just wouldn't pay $40 for a small piece of cardboard.  But WOW! did I love this game!!

The best CCG I've played. Theming is good, the game is full of flair. Each faction has a distinctive feeling. If it was just for that the game would have been just OK. But what makes it OUTSTANDING is that your play deck must have 52 cards and to resolve combat you deal yourself a hand of poker! So deck building has now 2 layers : you must have cards that work well together AND cards that allow you to get good poker hand so you can win combat. Cheating is even allowed! It's a shame that the game is now out of print.

One of the best dead CCGs. Certainly one of the best CCGs ever. The game is set in the 'weird west' an alternate world where the civil war didn't end and the earth is rife with mystics and hellspawn. Each card has a hoyle suit and value. Conflicts are resolved by playing 5-card draw. Best hand is dead man's hand ( Aces and eights) Aces are low, kings are high. The game was story driven - characters changed, some died, an entire faction was wiped out (the Flock)

Am more interested in the supernatural/undead/weird elements than the old west angle.

This is a good game, I think, with a lot of great ideas. I'm still not terribly clear on the strategies or on how to build good decks, but it's worth learning. It seems like it could be a pretty deep game and flexible, too. The Pistol Whip card seems overpowered, but I've only played four or five games.

I have enough cards to build a few decent decks, so I hope to introduce this to my main gaming buddy.

I'd be interested in trading for some useful cards to flesh out my collection.

RATING: N/A
Unplayed. I don't like the concept where better game cards also have higher poker hand values; in that sense I think that Warhammer CCG has the upper hand (what is the disincentive of not putting a bunch of ultra-powerful aces in your hand?? The cheating cards have mostly mild effects). Still, looking forward to trying it.

I love the backstory to this game, but find its CCG aspect to be frustrating and demoralizing (yes, I dumped a small mint down this rathole; I even bought some custom poker chips--see [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/842534/deadlands-doomtown]photograph[/url]). I lean toward playing with so-called "Bicycle" constructed decks even though this takes most Cheatin' cards out of the picture.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

CCG with some twists.  Innovative combat and deckbuilding mechanisms.  After one play there do seem to be a variety of different builds.

RATING: 6
While there were a few nice ideas here (poker hands anyone?), every game I played ended in the following way:
One player gets the upper hand because of one (1) important character. The other player calls out that character. First player realizes he'll loose without said character, so he commits all his characters to the shoot-out. Second player sends in all his characters as well. Who ever is left standing wins game. Fun the first two times, boring after that.

I liked the wild-west theme, but was spending so much time in the mechanics and the minutae of the cards (noon actions, hex actions, shoot-out actions) that the theme dissipated.

I am well beyond the patience, and likely ability to spend hours on deck-building - and this game screams for patient and careful deck-building. Collect lots of cards, select just the right ones for a posse you like, meet with your friends and battle it out against their carefully chosen decks.

I can't do it. I won't do it. So back to somebody's closet it goes... but not MY closet.

Without a doubt, this is the best CCG I've ever played.  I wish it would make a comeback. The combination of the poker hands made with the cards for shootouts and the need to balance good poker values with good actions, good deeds, and good dudes makes it a very satisfying game for deck-building.  There are also plenty of ways to win which leads to lots of interesting choices during play. 
The western with supernatural theme is also well-executed and the game is a blast to play or even watch.

The only CCG I ever really got into. I loved the goofy premise & setting of the game, and the combat resolution with poker hands, and the "cheating" hands, etc.  Creating a non-cheating deck was a challenge.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Interesting game set in the Weird West. Shootout mechanic using cards as poker hands is fun and innovative.

Got rid of my cards in anticipation of the reboot, which is also very good.

Great thematic build and battle system.  There is a lot of euro economics in this ccg, while still having the great asymmetrical themes.  Sadly, the game can stall out for some players which can be a bummer, and even worse, the game frequently will devolve into one big shootout where a lucky draw will determine everything.  I wish the commitment to battle was a bit less all or nothing.

Own almost The Entire Thing (tm) - all the cards with variant/alternate text, promos, etc., etc.

I think they should have re-started the game with a *new town* (now there's a thought!) after the mega-quake.

Toughest deck I've ever seen was an Indian deck - too many 1-Influence guys and the ability to 'call in' guys during made them extremely tough to deal with, either in Influencing control of the town or in a shootout.

excellent game!

Yeah it's a CCG. But it's out of print and can be gotten pretty cheaply. Played a ton at work. 50+ plays. Love the storyline. We play that you can't hire dudes from other outfits and restrict to two of the same cards instead of 4 (Double Barrelled Derringer variant). Much fun. Three player games can go for 20 minutes to 4 hours (four lunches). Two player games usually last 20 minutes. CCGs played without all of the degenerate stuff are a lot of fun. Playing with only outfit dudes makes the games more interesting and really brings out the theme. We also split up the outfits so that an outfit is owned by one person. Also made a ton of cards and put everything in sleeves to get what was missing.

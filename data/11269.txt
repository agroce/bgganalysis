I have a strong preference for WWII operational games.  This one offers so many new concepts from the earlier AH/SPI WWII games.  Too many to list.  It takes a couple of plays to appreciate the tactical nueances.  I continue to look for other operational games that use the same gaming mechanics.

The game is less complex that what it seems at first sight. After a couple of turns it will flow nicely. The two CRT tables add a nice feature to the game, not so much in terms of combat result but of general options that the Mobile or Assault imply. However, e assault movement will be used only in an advanced state of the game when the units artery close to each other. The supply lines are tough and difficult to trace sometimes. Keep an eye on them all the time. Armored units are not that many and play a crucial role in the game. Make sure to use them wisely and to not sacrifice any of them if not strictly necessary.
The coordination factor is the major novelty of the system and it adds a nice notch of realism to the game. Rules are clear with minimum examples but with an always useful extended example of play in the playbook.

RATING: 7
Got at bargain price on GMT winter fire sale.  Based on 3 plays of Soltzy only.

Solid graphics, neat scale, and fluid situation in the Soltzy battle.  All in all a solid and potentially excellent game.  

But my praise is limited due to the over-wrought rules (nice phrase I stole from another review) and charts; one might charitably say they are thorough.  They are. But my core take is they make the system seem more complex than it is, and read about 25% more wordy/ponderous than they need to be. This is a a 5.5 - 6.5 complexity game that as presented comes across as a 7 - 7.5.

So once I get cooking after a few turns, it hums along nicely, albeit long -- about an hour a turn when all the formations are really fighting.  There's no getting around this in a chit activation game, because your 8-9 activations are all 8-9 mini turns -- with successive attendant terrain cost re-lookups, combat drm lookups, etc.  

But the bigger hesitation for me is that each time I play, the rules review and game start up is hampered by the over-engineered rules layout and charts/summaries. Still, now that I am getting my arms more wrapped around the thing, I'd love to get more games (with more armor involved) in a series.

RATING: 8
Only played on the Soltsy map up to now. The game can feel a bit slow and overly detailed at times (up to 6 die rolls for combat + some before and after) but it creates a beautiful storyline in the process. Talking of beautiful: The counters and map also qualify for that attribute.
Scenarios seem interesting, I didn´t play enoughth to be able to talk about balance.
If you want a deep imersive wargame on a small scale (2km/hex) it´s definately recomendet. Also: At the moment it´s surprisingly cheap. Just be warned, that this is quite a step up from the Standart Combat Series or A Victory Lost.

RATING: 9
Played Staraya Russa finally, I think it's not as tight a situation as Solstoy (although Solstoy is a great battle). It almost feels like it's at the wrong scale, a little bit too much traffic control, too many random units to manage for what you get out of it. At Solstoy it works, but Staraya Russa is going to run 6+ hours for the short game, *looong* for the long game, which is not great. The German steamroller that crushes the Soviet flank isn't hugely compelling gaming either. It's still a great system, but I'm not sure I have a huge desire to try Staraya Russa when I have Kasserine and Bataan! - or Solstoy - available.
---
UPDATE: Just a few tips on playing scenarios 1 & 2:
Scenario 2 is a good afternooner, but scenario 1 is long, about 8 hours. I quite enjoyed playing it, but by the end I felt like we were getting sloppy just because we'd been playing for 8 hours or so. When I play it again I think I'll do it over two sessions, just to break things up a bit.

The Solstoy situation is great because so much is going on - the initial drive for the city followed by the Soviet siege, the rearguard action to keep the supply road open, the possible left hook from the 6th Motorized, Soviet offensives on several fronts ... good fun, and a very dynamic and interesting situation. One of the things I like about vonBorries' games are the optional reinforcement groups that you can take at a VP cost. Both sides have some here, and in scenario 1 a lot of the early German game should be about making sure the Soviets *can't* take their very powerful optional group without immediately losing. The two later groups (steps for the Soviets, some very powerful air units for the Germans) are really tough calls. Both are powerful, but both come at significant cost. 

I think what sets this game apart from most similar wargames is just that a pair of good, interesting, but lesser-known battles were selected, plus of course while RtL is neither short nor simple, it is quite playable by wargame standards. vonBorries also keeps a solid, consistent core to his games, so while Kasserine and the Barbarossa games play differently, there is enough commonality to keep things under control.

Vance von Borries is such a reliable designer. After playing a number of wargames this year that were such crap, it was a real joy to play Roads to Leningrad. Great situation, similar enough to previous games like Kasserine to be playable, lots of interesting player choices, a number of different tactical approaches. Several playable scenarios. The impulse system feels great here (I'm not generally a fan of chit-draws) and limits downtime. Graphically very nice. Like Kasserine, not something I'll be able to play that often, but a game I'm likely to continue to enjoy for quite a while.

I thought Kasserine was an excellent game but this game has improved on what was great in Kasserine. I'm not really a big fan of the activation chit system but it is used to great effect here in simulating the different op tempos of the Germans and the Russians. At the same time, the chit draw lends uncertainty and surprise to the ebb and flow of battle. And again, as in Kasserine, the ER system plays a worthy role here in preventing unrealistic odds calculation in battles. Aesthetics- wise, RtL is also very pleasing to the eye. All in all, this game is worthy of a 10.

RATING: 8
This rating is based the experience I have after playing the first scenario. First, the rules are complex. There is lots of minutia which might have been better to abstracted into the system. For example, both side have different rules when and how many times they can use aircrafts (and which types) in a turn. Since the aircrafts doesn't have such a big impact in a separate combet, I think this might have been abstacter into a more simplier rules. Althought I miss some of the meatier aircraft options that the Kasserine system had. I would have liked to see using aircrafts disrupting key artillery units (maybe the option isn't proper for this battle but I liked that in Kasserine game). My first turn took more time than the three following turns combined because I had to check every rule separately during the first one. After the system is learned, the turns are played very quickly even when there are lots of units around - I think this is one of the beauties of impulse system. The game has lots of good stuff going on. The impulse system and two different CRTs makes German and Soviet forces very distinct with minumum rule fuss. The components are very beautiful and I like the big hexes and counters. The only problem I have with the map is the fact that the victory point locations aren't high-lighted. It is very irrating to check player-aid to see the hex-number and then try to find the hex to see which hexes should be targeted. I also like the fact that the first scenario starts with very few units. And now my final verdict: The game seems to very good and of high-quality. The problems are minor if you are willing to put some effort into learning the rules.

Terrific! Large hexes and large counters. Playing several scenarios, I find that both sides were equally matched. The board, quality of counters, and the rules are typical of GMT's excellence. Some compared this game to Kasserine. Although they have similarities, RTL is much better. If you are into WWII games, you won't be dissapointed buying this game.

Game covers the battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russa, with multihex combat and air and artillery assets coordinated by HQs. Maps and pieces are attractive, with well-written rules. This only rates an 8 due to a perceived imbalance in favour of the Germans in the Staraya Russa scenarios.

Minus:
-All in all it is good but there is a small but:
There is lots chroome and although it adds realism, imho this bogs down the game more than I prefer.
-Secondly the military situation depicted is interesting but I am concered with replay value as the options are rather limited due to the severe terrain restrictions.

Conlusion, a good -possibly even great game- hampered by the type of battles; obscure battles, which is fine but  the terrain does not allow many options.

This is a great design with great quality components and deserves at least an 8 but I unfortunately did not get warm with the battles depicted.

Sold it.

Both games feature desperate defenses and crushing attacks by both sides. The system highlights the features and issues related to assymetrical warfare. The Germans have powerful and mobile but fewer units and are often blessed with two activations to one for the Soviets. They must use the principles of manuever warfare to the utmost in order to win. The numerous, lumbering Soviets rely on their waves of infantry to pound the Hitlerite's weak points while using their few mobile units to stretch the Germans.

Despite its lofty operational goals, this is really a game of hypertactical micromanagement.  There are very few interesting decisions to make at the scale the player is supposed to be operating at and so the game turns into an exercise in managing die roll modifiers and the expenditure of assets.  The victory conditions are poorly designed and subject to being "gamed" by the Soviet player (who will often hold his artillery & armor back to deny the Germans precious victory points).

This is a detailed operational level look at two battles between the Germans and Russians in 1941.  The forces are different, but fairly evenly matched with the Germans having the qualitative advantage and the Russians the quanities.  Both sides get to attack and defend, and there are many tough decisions for the players to make.  The chit activation system makes it solitaire friendly, but it's a bit bigger (longer to set up and play) and too complex for my tastes now.  If I had a few hours for a FTF game with someone, this wouldn't be the game I'd choose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Kasserine's engine, streamlined and with activation chits, makes for a good solo game and fast FTF play.  Scenario #1 victory conditions seem imbalanced in favor of an experienced Soviet player, and Scenario #2 more so.  Traded the game before playing the other half.  There was nothing inherently wrong with the game, but the system was a little fiddly and became dull.  Positives: chit activations make for fast play and easy solitaire use; components for GMT games continue to get even better and RtL's are excellent, with color play-aids, a very clear rulebook, and a lengthy example-of-play (I never had a rule question come up, very good!); there is a free Cyberboard gamebox available that uses graphics supplied by GMT.  If you're space-limited, a solitaire player, or a panzer-pusher, this is worth trying.

Very simply, one of the best games of 2005.  I am a fan of Kasserine as well, and this system feels very much like it.  What I like: the scenario choices (great historical battles that were decisive - good motivation), the lack of downtime because of the AM pulling, and the weaponry involved.  What I don't like: Germans have only won 2 times (out of seven games).  I haven't won as Germany yet. :-(  Still getting a feel for this one.

Very good game. The German often must renounce a deep advance in order to defend against a probable heavy counterattack. The Soviet experiments the sacrifice of the infantry sent to destroy the armored units.
The automatic coordination is a fair rule and a disrupted unit is in big trouble ( whit the -2 DRM and the limit brought to +/- 5 ).
Whatever side you are playing, you always face a hard choice : sacrifice mobility to build tougher defense or pick the mobile sequence, gaining terrain but exposing your flanks.

Really nice looking system, and the game is one of GMT's best, as far as components go (love the maps!). I haven't had a chance to play yet, but really look forward to it. Detailed operational system, most divisional components being battalions. My main concern are possible 'gamey' tactics possible by the Soviet player, mentioned by a couple of others here, but I'm wondering if house rules could address these. Not all that complicated, but the rules *do* push 30 pages (counting illustrations, etc), so be aware what you're getting into.

Only last night I set up scenario 1, checked out some rules-points I was no longer clear on (if I ever was) and have been playing all morning. very good game with interesting decisions to make by both sides.

Comments after two plays of the Soltsy scenario (one as Soviet, one as German)

What I like:

The quality of the components: Great map, big and clear counters, well organized charts, very handy setup cards and the superb expanded example of play.

Very little errata.

The Game system models well the difference between a highly trained and maneuverable German army and a more numerous, but lacking coordination Soviet army.

What leaves me a little bit unsatisfied:

The way Artillery and Air units are used in the game system: No independent fire to disrupt enemy units or interdict hexes.

Mobile CRT still quite bloody for armor units, even at 6:1!

VP hexes not highlighted on the map

No rule to retreat towards your HQ or supply source first, if possible: I pushed back a Soviet unit which was able to retreat towards my mapside, thus still threatening to cut my supply! :-/

My gaming experience:

Game play is quite long and I understand it might annoy some players, but it is not a problem, as far as I'm concerned.

In order to win (at least in the Soltsy scenarios) the German must thoroughly optimize his play, while it's easier to play the Soviet efficiently enough to prevent the German from winning. [This could limit replayability...]

...But it's also quite frustrating to play the Soviet: The ability of the German to react and reinforce his units under attack makes you feel quite powerless – unless you manage to durably cut the German supply...

The relative complexity of the rules requires some commitment, but I've never found it was too much for the reward...

Date of comment: April 2013

Sold because I could not duplicate history with this game system: May be I'm too bad as the German player, but I decided to give up this system on the Eastern Front: RtM seems even more difficult for the Germans! :-/

Rating based on single play of Scenario 1, a swirling knife fight until rain set in, with the Germans surviving the first wound and going on to win after smashing 21st Tank Corps.  Great adaptation of the Kasserine system.

RATING: 7
Prefer Roads to Moscow because the situation is more interesting and the terrain in RtM allow for more channels to attack from but this one is a good game to learn the system with. Soltsy is the better of the two because it is better balanced but Staraya Russa is smaller, so it lends itself well as a solo game to learn the system. 

Von Borries rarely designs a bad game and this is proof of that. Recommended.

The scale of this game is perfect IMO, I wish this system was expanded to cover more battles, it would make a great serie. From a historical perspective, you get to see how a division operates with all its sub-elements, how it moves, deploys and fights. A lot less abstracted than having a single counter represent a whole division. You get all the operational goodness you could dream of without having to play a monster game.

Some people say the rules are fiddly, I don't agree. They're involved but not particularly hard to grasp at all. The main hurdle is the choice you have between two CRTs and two different sequences for each formation activation : mobile or assault. It can be a bit disconcerting at first because it is not a very common concept but after a couple of turns, you get the hang of it easily. 

This system portrays really well the opposing forces, fast and flexible for the Germans and a lot more rigid and less coordinated for the Soviets without gimping them artificially.

You have a lot of options and you're required to make A LOT of choices which is great IMO. Every single decision is important and the combat sequence as well as the CRTs are brilliant. It is not simply a matter of moving stacks of units and adding combat factors, you have to decide how to spend the command points of your HQs and leaders, Manstein and Voroshilov, to coordinate artillery, multi hexes attacks, fight on the move or in an assault, CAS, decide to make a no retreat defense, refuse combat, or have units react to an attack etc. 

It might sound a bit daunting, but it is honestly fairly easy and personaly I really like the fact that the combat sequence is detailed and gives you a lot of options to influence the outcome.

RATING: 4
Interesting game - and very different from other East Front productions I've played (rating based off 3 FtF plays of first 2 scenarios).  Both sides have great opportunities to attack and defend and the Germans can very well be stopped by means other than "General Winter" or some other added rule.  The components are top notch.  The system is a streamlined version of Kasserine that plays smoother and quicker with a bit of tension due to chit draw.  My complaints - this game seems very open to some "gamey" tactics that aided the Soviets and took away from a historical approach such as an ability to essentially 'hide' units that provide the German's with VPs (for example - HQ, armor and arty units abandoning leaving the line and infantry if it looks like the Germans are about to break through) and having parts of Soviet divisions (i.e. regiments & battalions) operate very independently (and effectively when they cut the supply lines) from HQs which they never did / did well at this point in the war.  I look forward to more games in this series, but will not pre-order and probably not buy until I read some player AARs and see some changes.

Not sure what to say after one game...one the one hand the game is both over-wrought and given to wild swings in play.  Not sure if a German road-clearing exercise needed an expensive boxed game though.  For a truly historical game this one should have had some hidden/fog/limited inteligence rules.  The basic historical ambush will never happen.  The rules and gameplay are a bit stolid.

This game explains in an accurate and still playable way the differences between the lager and unwieldy soviet army vs. the smaller and nimbler German army. &#8211; The Germans have an inferior mechanisation level and much fewer units but a superior command and control system making them deadly both on offensively and defensively.

I am not sure about some of the scenario 1 comments on game play starting with the play notes in the box.  Many people seem to think the Germans will sieze some objects and then go over to the defensive.  I believe the system favors attacking and the German strong point is mobile force that can pack a strong offensive punch if the move to go after weak points.

Sitting and waiting for the Soviets to come and get you is fullish in my view.

Just picked up thru eBay -- looking forward to working through a very robust game system -- wish I had Borries' Kasserine game.  The components are outstanding -- the turn record cards alone grab your eyes.

Unable to rate yet, but after a partial play of scenario #2, I like the system a lot. There's a fair amount of complexity, but it's mitigated by the chit pull system--as a relative newbie wargamer, the chit pull is a mechanism I love for keeping my decisions manageable. There doesn't seem to be a flood of exceptions for everything, and it just feels well thought out and developed. Well done. I look forward to more plays.

Prepped, read, stickered and waiting for a good chunk of time to put on the table.

Really excellent system. Kind of a lighter version of Von Borries East Front Series. Much smaller scale too of course. Smooth rule set and fun to play

Very good sequel to GMT's Kasserine. The random activation system is a love/hate thing.

edit: Kasserine is the better of the two.

I feel this is just too complex. There are too many rules for exceptions/special cases.

If you like that kind of thing it's a good thing, I don't hence the 5 rating

Why did I buy this? Did I really expect to have that much time, and find an opponent? Well, it looks very nice.

Uses very similar rules to other von Borries games, but he has tightened them up a bit.  Solstoy is a good scenario whose interesting roads and terrain creates lots of areas of conflict.

Too much rules for what it tries to do.

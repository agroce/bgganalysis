I do not see all the depth or strategy that many report. My aircrafts are destroyed at almost any attack, they can not manage a small 2 fighters escort. Never done 2 rounds of combat. After few days I have no pilots anymore and have to look at raids for days as spectator. RAF game on this theme is much more attractive.

RATING: 8
Another WWII solitaire game, this one covering the Battle of Britian at the operational level. The player controls when and where to commit planes for the defense of Britian.  Includes nice touches like managing pilot fatigue and the repair of damaged infrastructure in addition to shooting down planes. The rules are surprisingly well written and clear. Fun diversion when you don't have an opponent.

Printed from Interweb stuff. A built for solitaire that kept my interest - enjoyed it quite a bit. My only niggle is that it needs a lot of space to set up.

Varias campañas no registradas.

Para jugar en solitario en cierta época pudo resultar interesante y novedoso, pero ha envejecido mal y es un juego con múltiples carencias que acaba siendo repetitivo y simple.
Solo se puede manejar 2 cazas como inglés y el raid alemán consta siempre de 5 aparatos entre cazas y bombarderos (siempre al azar). Esto resulta sumamente limitado. Pronto todos los raids diarios resultan similares y se cae en el aburrimiento. 
La IA es completamente aleatoria y hay pocas opciones de juego.
La versión para 2 jugadores peca un poco de lo mismo, siendo un poco más divertido (no mucho) gracias a las decisiones del jugador alemán.
En definitiva, demasiado aleatorio, sencillo y repetitivo.

It's an exercise in constantly trying to find the right balance between caution and risk. And constantly praying for the dice to be kind. Often it is frustrating and fun at the same time. I've learned not to challenge those six plane raids; they eat my lunch almost every time.

Anyone who has read Derek Robinson's Piece of Cake and its depiction of coordinating the intercepts of bomber intercepts between the ground control boffins and the fighter squadrons would appreciate this game - "Make up your Teutonic minds!" grouses one of the characters as the bomber formation zigs when he thought it would zag.

 The system is simple and smooth with plenty of meat on the bones to keep it interesting and tense.  The movement mechanism for the Germans and the combat system are both well thought out.  One of the best solitare games I have ever seen.A great game!Update: since obtaining RAF, this one does not come out too much now. Still a good game but, if I want to fight the Battle of Britain, I'll go with RAF.

Another of AH's attempts to create a solitaire wargame, this one was better than most, on par with Patton's Best but a far cry from Ambush! The Battle of Britain seems to inspire solitaire games (see RAF also), but it's possible that the topic just isn't suitable for gaming; none have been particularly successful or interesting IMHO.

Nice light game of Battle of Britain. Tactical options are somewhat limited, and things can go really well or really badly with little input from the player, but overall a nice resource management game (pilots and fatigue) covering the conflict. Good for less-experienced players, but still fun for grognards if you don't want a detailed treatment. A more focused treatment than RAF (which covers the Luftflotte 3 bombing sectors). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty fun solitaire fare.  The rules are nothing to write home about, but you get the point quickly enough.  The components are pretty nice as well.  However, the best part of this game is that it really gives you an appreciation for how difficult things were for the Brits (tip: don&#039;t go chasing 109&#039;s without your wing-man).  The only real problem with this game is the somewhat long set up time.

On my first try, both my spitfires were shot down while I managed to bag only a He-111 and send a Do-17 home.  What I look for in solitaire games is an immersive experience where I can picture the action as it unfolds.  This game offers more than B-17 and I find I do have to decide carefully what to do each turn.  Everything is not cut out and obvious as it may seem at first.  The decision to let a raid go by in the hopes of catching them at better odds is gamble you are continuously faced with.  I like this quite a lot.

RATING: 7
One of a select few solitaire boardgame I found compelling enough to complete not just once, but several times. Focus your attention on the critical and interesting elements of the campaign with only a minimal amount of housekeeping and process. The system is vulnerable to abuse (for example, leaving one point of damage on a target to prevent the Luftwaffe from bombing it, then repairing it overnight to steal a couple victory points), but when played as an experience rather than a quest for a high score, it will take you back to the summer of 1940 quite nicely. Easy to play and has exactly the level of detail I desire.

Bought in 2007 due to theme and some great AAR's here on BGG. I have RAF and I thought this might make a nice change from the grand stategic view down to the individual pilot and plane level.

A good game but not as engaging as RAF. Has its moments and it is fun charting the rise and fall of your few pilots.

Solitaire game set during the Battle of Britain.  The player plays two RAF pilots going up against the Luftwaffe.

London's Burning is a very good solitaire game covering the Battle of Britain, focusing on the attacks on London and the surrounding area from 13 August 1940 - also known as "Adler Tag" ("Eagle Day") - to 15 September 1940 (for the long scenario).  It is an easy game to learn, but VERY difficult to win, as you never seem to have enough fighters available to truly make a difference (two fighters at a time never seems to be enough to turn the tables).  Nevertheless, it is very enjoyable.

I didn't care for this game at first. Played it several times and gave it away. Move ahead about 5 years.  I had my interest rekindled after reading more positive reviews. The person I gave it to still had it, and had never played it.  So it came back to me and now i think it's a very enjoyable game.  It's not the most realistic but that doesn't matter. As a game, it's fun, engaging and doesn't take too long.  I made the mistake at first of comparing it to RAF Solitaire. They are two completely different games. Different mindset and different expectations showed me what a little gem this game is. So glad to have it back in the collection!

A fun game where two planes are abstracted for all the planes.  It gets tough when you can't keep both planes up because you don't have the pilots.  Taking off and lining up your attack, which is a big part of the game, can get tedious.  For a more serious and better game, play RAF.

Have played the first two turns to learn the flow and it goes pretty well.  I can see parts getting a bit repetitive, but once you have a collection of pilots and things start going belly-up, I can imagine the stories get good.  I still don't think I am handling pilot fatigue correctly yet: I mean, how can you be rested the day after being rescued from the English channel when your plane went down?

I love this game! Overlooked gem... probably best appreciated by the kind of player who enjoys DVG style Air Leader games. GREAT Vassal mod too... I play about 1 to 2 days in a session and game play is right under an hour.

Very atmospheric game of Britain's desperate defense in the air.  If the dice fall the wrong way during an early raid, you're up against the wall.  One of the few solitaire games I've actually played more than once.

Along with RAF I enjoy this game too, they are so different. I am not sure if the German plane mix is historical. I like it since it is plane to plane.

I've only played it solo, and I just can't keep England's skies safe.  Good theme, good implementation.

This one goes up to 9, because the two-player variant is also a lot of fun. Excellent [i]hidden gem[/i]. Can easily be played with casual gamers, too.

Interesting little game, which portrays the Battle of Britain on a tactical/operational level. Lost twice, but seriosly kicked the Luftwaffe's butt after starting with two Spitfires pilots, who became aces after three days. :angry:

I need to get this one back on my shelf again. I like it. A solid solo game.

This is fun to play as a two player cooperative game.  The AI of Germany is entertaining to watch unfold.  This is certainly almost all luck, but it most definately gives you the illusion of control.  You really feel attatched to your boys as you build them into ace pilots.  So the theme masks all of the die rolls.  Really most of this game is just playing odds on the chart, but I love the fog of war, the interception, the hit placement and ammo usage.

We play that if you hit the gunner twice then the planes don't get a shot back (but they aren't taking any real damage).

Really, this works well as a fun team experience.

A cleverly-designed, fun multiphase game of WWII fighter combat and defense of England.  Good in both solitaire and two-player mode.

Nice solitaire game.  Not so great with a German player. There's too much control over the attackers, then.

Good little game to kill a rainy afternoon.  Recommend getting the issue of the General featuring it as well.

Will include General issue with trade of game...

Simply a great solitare game, real tension as you decide to intercept a big raid and risk your pilots. Just finished a long campaign which I lost near the end after all my pilots where killed. Get this game you will not regret it.

RATING: 8
Great game, tense and involving. Rules are excellent, very clear and concise with some good examples of play. 

I've left it set up and keep going back to it to play 'just another phase or two'. It's totally captivating.

Another very enjoyable solo game. Not as deep as RAF but if you want a shorter game were you can battle it out in the skies above England this is a must have. Be warned... your pilots are very vulnerable and can die very easily. Pick and choose your battles carefully and try to always maximize your attack position for better dice rolls. It is better to take some damage here and there then lose pilots recklessly. You can always repair damage but if you lose to many pilots - especially at the beginning of the game - you are lost. Great game and a must for solo gamers who are interested the Battle of Britain or WWII aviation in general.

Ok, but not great. I would actually label this as more of a euro, than a traditional wargame. Sure, it is about war, but in a slightly Hollywoodish way. It does not really give any strategic clues as to the campaign was thought.

Nice, simple solitaire game of the Battle of Britain. Note quite the depth of RAF, but has more personality.

Though with high degree of abstraction, Ben Knight succeeded to show German Blitz and desperate effort of RAF.

Totally different from RAF from Westend games.

See my review.

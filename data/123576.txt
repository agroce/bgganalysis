A decent medium/medium-light filler.  While there's nothing particularly innovative (it reminds me a bit of Arkadia or a simpler version of Reef Encounter), it is an attractive game with simple rules and good player interaction.  I think 2 player will get samey relatively quickly but with the quick play time, I suspect this will get om my 2012 dime list (which is good for me).  I am curious whether I'll be able to introduce my 6 and 10 yros to the game.

Kind of an abstract filler game in which you move some sheep around and then just gather scoring tiles with openly known values according to which terrains contain more animals. The board and specially the animeeples are really nice, but overall the game is too light and doesn't actually feel fun or engaging. Just uninspired.

I really really wanted other folks to play this game before me so I could be warned off or encouraged to try it as needed.  I had a bad vibe about what little I knew (hidden information, screwage) and I didn't want to get stuck in a long awful game if that's what it was.  But somehow I got into our group's first game anyway, convinced that the game would be short one way or the other.  And in truth, it was both short and fairly decent.  The game plays a bit like a tarted up version of Quandary, with a little dice luck thrown in.  But it is fun and cute and I'm happy to report that I would play it any time it comes out.

Players are shepherds, trying to herd sheep into lucrative scoring pasture terrain.  Players on their turn take three actions, one of which must be to move their shepherd.  Movement is on a small, tight playing board, depicting five or six different terrain types, loosely organised into hexagons.  Moving a shepherd blocks the connection between two hexagons for the rest of the game, meaning sheep gradually get penned into hexes.  Other actions include moving sheep across the shepherd into the adjacent hex, purchasing a terrain tile to increase your scoring at the end of the game, and teleporting your shepherd to another area of the board.  Your final score is sheep in terrain multiplied by the terrain tiles you purchased.  Fun, fast, and tight game of position.  Very simple to play.  Good stuff.

Aranyos játék, elég egyszerű szabályokkal.
Azonban nem érzem teljesen kiforrottnak sajnos. A szabályok furák, a játék végére könnyen kötelezővé válik olyan lépések megtétele, amik csak mínuszt termelnek. Ráadásul ezt megelőzi egy olyan időszak is, amikor ugyan mínuszt nem termelsz, de értelmetlen lépéseket kell tenned. Így a játék kb. negyede értelmetlen. Ráadásul lehet olyan helyzet is, hogy egyáltalán nem tudsz lépni, de erre se tér ki a szabály. Ezeken felül túl nagy előnye van a kezdőnek, és az őt követőknek, mert ingyen bezsebelhetnek egy csomó "részvényt". 
Nekem közel állt volna a szívemnhez, mert szeretem a cuki, de vérremenő játékokat, ráadásul elég rövid is, de sajna nem kerek az egész. Mindezt tetézi az játékélményhez mért irreális ára.

After the first game where one can be slightly uncertain, it works pretty well in the end.

On top of all of this there are very nice production values.

Cute game with a nice presentation. Quick moving and with some interesting decisions. You move your pawn around the board, only affecting the areas near you, shuffling sheep from area to area, trying to get the most in areas for which you have the most stock. Light stock speculation mixed with a spatial element is something that just works for me, as with Arkadia and Acquire. Sheepland probably isn't quite up to those standards, but I'm willing to play more to find out.

Players 'invest' in areas of the board while trying to gather sheep in their areas and building fences to hinder opponents from luring them away again.
Sheepland is a Winsome game in sheep's clothing if it weren't for the die to move the one black sheep. Players form tacit alliances, leech on others' efforts and decrease the value of opponent's 'shares'. 
A good game but it's hindered in reaching its target group by a misfit between the cuddly theme and the abstract gameplay with negative interactions.

Sheepland has been described as "Reef Encounter Light" and this is a very telling description. Choose your scoring tiles and drive the sheep towards them, often by stealing other players' sheep.

Don't let the art and theme fool you. This is not the family/kids game it appears to be. In fact I think it would make a pretty poor gateway game despite the simple ruleset. 

It's actually an abstracted stock holding game in sheep's clothing. 

The core mechanic is one that will be familiar to players of 18xx, Chicago Express, Imperial, Acquire, Airlines Europe, Union Pacific and the like and at only 30-45 minutes per game it's an great filler for fans of the genre. 

If you've never tried this type of game it may take a play or two to wrap your head around but it's a great introduction to the niche. With a box 1/4 of the size of Paris Connection it may even be the best quick example of this mechanic which is usually found in significantly longer games.

Sheepland is a neat abstract game with a very cute theme. The board has 24 regions, four each of six types. Players purchase increasingly expensive stock in the different terrain (i.e. I buy a share in pasture), move sheep between regions, and set fences to prevent the relocation. Scores are determined by multiplying the sheep in each region by the number of shares of that type.

Sheepland is simple and has lovely pieces, but it was a bit dry and I doubt it is something we would play over and over again.

RATING: 5
A multiplayer abstract cloaked in a sheep theme. Your turn is mostly centred around choosing to invest in a colour that others are building up, or build up a colour that you've invested in, or a bit of both. Wasting actions to stop someone else building up their colour just leads to you falling behind other players who are also accumulating, so this isn't really a viable option either - this classic abstract problem isn't solved by the game, except that's it's hoping to come in short enough, and with a cute enough theme, to distract you from it. So everyone bunches up on points, and at game-end it's pretty clear what's worth spending money on and whether it'll net a profit. Given that the game leads to player-bunching, where doing something very clever isn't really provided as an option, it's not a game I felt needed further exploring.

--Mar2013-- Simple set/share collection game, with a bit of value mutation along the way.  It seems turn order is something one needs to keep in mind:  the viability of certain actions for the final player aren't the same as for the first player.  But there doesn't appear to be much skew in the scoring potential.  It's cute, fast, light, and has some charming sheeples.

Light stock-holding game. Players move their shepherds to road spaces between two regions, leaving an impassable fence behind. Each region is a terrain type, and one of the actions is to acquire a share -- each share worth a point at the end of the game for each sheep on that type. Other actions are additional moves or to move one sheep between the fields adjacent to the shepherd.

I picked this up because I like share games and, other than the dice-driven black sheep, it seemed like a Winsome in sheep's clothing. I'm not sure the incentive structure really works, though, and players seem too richly rewarded for picking up a bunch of cheap shares. The random movement of the black sheep can also cause significant swings.

It's OK.

Sheepland is essentially very simple family game, which has large tactical options. You walk across land with a pawn representing a herdsman and make sheep cross over roads, herding them together. You can buy shares of your neighbouring lands, which can be really valuable at the end of the game. Whole match lasts until you lay last fence on the board. Players are then rewarded according to number of sheep on tiles, where they have shares. There is only one luck factor in the whole game, when you move black sheep according to throw of the dice. Everything else depends solely on decision of players. Result is therefore totally your work and you have nobody else to blame for your success or failure. Each turn consists of three actions, which can be chosen by you, although you might get little heavyheaded, when it gets to rule about repeating one action twice. But the game itself contains really nice tactical concepts and players are constantly stealing sheep from each other. Sheepland is game, which deserves more attention, than it gets and not only with families, but also among advanced players. They can discover surprising tactical options here.

There are 6 different regions of the board and you get points by purchasing tiles for each of the 6 regions.  At the end of the game, each tile is worth 1 point for each sheep in that region.  The rest of the game involves moving sheep between regions and moving your shepherd around the board.  Each time you move, you leave behind a fence that makes the space blocked for sheep and shepherd movement.  There is also a black sheep that moves around the board randomly that is worth double the points.

It was kind of an amusing game.  The rules for your actions are a little more complex than maybe they need to be, and the other players had a hard time grasping the rules and strategy.  I'll definitely need to give this another play.

Three actions, but you want more.

An enjoyable filler.  Just enough decisions to make the 20 or 30 minutes it takes to play interesting.

Sheepland is in the category of games where players speculate on the value of "stocks," which will primarily be determined by player actions. The only random elements are what your initial free share is (out of six types), and the random movements of a black sheep that is worth a bit more than the normal sheep.

Buying shares and affecting their value both require moves, which creates tension and a need to strike a balance. There's also tension in that the cost of a share increases as they are sold. It probably won't do, to focus on building up the value of one terrain type, and only then spend moves to buy its shares.

On the other hand, I guess you can do rather well by not trying very hard to build value anywhere, and simply spending moves trying to buy up shares while they are cheap, hoping there are some winners in there. I think this may be a weakness of the design, actually, though I am not sure.

I don't like that the map is symmetrical. I feel this increases the feeling that you could nail down specific strategies.

I also don't like how for just a buck you can teleport your shepherd anywhere. I realize something is needed to prevent shepherds from getting trapped, but as it is it feels too open.

Reminds me of Clans, but I think this is more interesting.

Easy to learn, plays very fast and scales well.  Nothing ground breaking, but enjoyable none the less.

In a group of 4 experienced gamers and one other, I was the only one who could come close to groking this super simple game.  I do not think anyone really enjoyed the one time we played.

Mastery: (30 minutes as quoted)
Square box - medium (Gravwell)

The most delightful and lite [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/tag/shares/user/Vroenis]shares[/url] game yet!

Light-medium weight (2, shares, action rules).
Low player interaction.
Low theme application.

For a shares-investment game, this is such a delightful little production with fantastic art and components, short play-time but fantastic dynamic.

Played one of our gaming buddy's copy. Hubby and I enjoyed it as we were born in the year of the goat and also we are capricorns so we love any sheep or goat board games :)

Fast game, maybe lacks depth and replayability?

I wasn't expecting to like this game, but it's actually quite good. It's especially surprising the amount of interesting decisions squeezed into such a fast and short game (we're talking 30 minutes per game, tops).

It would have been an insta-buy if it wasn't for the (IMHO) steep price tag and overly large box/board/components.

Indiegogo pledge, sold to Raevon. Very good game that support up to 6 players. Each of the player have to farm for material to brew and complete customer(drinker)'s order at shortest time to get reward point instead of penalty. If you are not being well, you will have to meet the nasty boss! (of course sometimes your team mate will poke you in front of the boss too), which the mechanism is quite interesting!

I love the theme. The idea that you can roll "badly' is present, higher rolls do simply seem better. But there is a way to try to mitigate that, but it's not as well executed as in some games, like this games older, heavier cousin Rise to Nobility, or Alien Frontiers.

That said - I'm looking forward to further exploring the balance and game play options, it's a little silly and swing prone (e.g. some "bad" cards ruin your day, some do nothing) but thematically I really enjoy this one.

Great dice worker placement game, although I think I will modify turn order slightly because the do everything on you turn can lead to horrible slow down at higher player numbers.  The dice mechanic and places you have to put dice are varied enough that aside from the very first turn, there are no times where you can't do something productive with your dice.

:d6-1: 

Workerplacement, dice and a cool fantasy-theme. Ok as a multiplayer but the solo-version offered little when it came to dicethrill and the puzzle/strategy-part was nice but not enough - especially when the AI-players moves was already known when you started your turn.

I found I didn't really feel a thrill to take it out as a solitaire again and many of the other multiplayer-games I have are more asked for when we play here. A friend gave me an offer (full price - wanting to help out when he knew I needed money) and ensured me I was welcome to borrow it whenever I liked and that he would gladly play it with me.

This game is rock solid.  I only have one minor complaint (see point 3 below). I have only played it twice with my girlfriend so I can not comment on the 2+ player game play but I think it would actually be better. 
1) Theme is whimsical and the game does convey that you are in a bar trying to complete drink orders. 
2) To fill most orders you are often scrambling to complete them and there is just enough scarcity that makes it feel fulfilling to complete an order. Never did I feel down and out that I couldn't complete an order even when I got a bad roll. 
3) There is a "take that" element but at 2 players I do not think it is that prevalent. I did get a Mr. Nasty card but it said "Let you off this time" and another time, I had to return ingredients to the pile but I didn't really need that ingredient. I imagine that this could be debilitating under the right circumstances. There is definitely some luck to the Mr. Nasty cards. 
4) I would recommend playing with the Mrs. Nasty expansion every time because it allows more options and chances to get more ingredients and points.  The expansion is minimal and only enhances the game play. 
5) The art is great but then again, I am a fan of the Mico (artist) and love games like Raiders of the North.  

I would really like to play it with more players but not sure when or if that will happen.

very well received even by newbies!  then theme jumps off the board and while the rules can be a bit tough of a read the first times , they flow pretty well in subsequent plays.  The Secret Chamber expansion adds a much needed +/- for pips but we've enjoyed the game even without it.  Don't have to worry about a run away leader as there are several mechanisms to keep this in check.

nice components, great theme, art ties it all together for a fun 10 rounds of drinks :)

Kind of lukewarm on this game; tactically it's...  Okay, but there's really very little strategic depth to it at all.  Given how random it seems to be, wish it was at least shorter.  Feels a bit like tactical Yahtzee with nice art.

Mainly I suppose I'd tolerate playing it because wife gets to use her dice tower. >_>

I like dice placement games in general, and this one is easily the most thematic of the ones I've played. The mechanics match the theme perfectly and the premise is great. But... You've got the dice, then the card draws, and Nasty. That's a lot of random, swingy stuff to navigate. Some cards are far better than others, including the secret objective cards which can make a huge difference at the end of the game. I'd never play this with six players.

It's not easy working in the Cavern Tavern, preparing complicated drinks for patrons that range from trolls to elves.  Great artwork and expensive-looking components helped to immerse me in this original, very thematic worker placement game.  Dice are a bit hard to read but I quickly got used to it.   Can get a bit frustrating if the dice just don't roll the way you're hoping, and the many decks of ingredient cards are annoying.

I have been spoiled by my diceless euros and their minimization of randomness, but this one does do a respectable job of turning undesirable dice into an intriguing analytical challenge of prioritization. 

However, I nigh guarantee that there will be that one person in your group (you know the one) that will hate this game for the exact same reason and give up halfway through, which is what happened to me. It does drag a bit too long, the rulebook is implicitly-phrased garbage...but it is a refreshing concept in worker placement that is supported by theme and world-building. Probably will not see the table much (if at all) with 6 anymore, but with 4, perhaps.

EDIT: Traded away.

Interesting theme about serving customers in a bar. Also the whole dice as worker placement to collect ingredients before making your drink to fulfill customers' orders is fantastic. Unfortunately there is absolutely no dice mitigation in the base game and thus you get pretty much screwed everytime you have bad rolls. Luck can be so punishing in this game that sometimes its even better to get VP from chores and kitchen. Can't recommend this game really which is such a shame coz I liked the theme.

Fun dice placement game. It can move round quite quickly too so the game has good pace. There is more strategy to it than I thought there'd be. You can do things to mitigate some of the random chance and you do feel like you've won your points as apposed to being lucky with your rolls. 

That being said it's quite a light game with a relatively simple puzzle at it's heart.  After everyone's played it a few times I imagine it will just come down to the luck of the dice.

Purchased Tabletop Simulator DLC version. Hmm... It will take some coaxing to play a waiter in a pub, but it's well designed, the dice placement is cool. We'll see how it goes!

Strange theme, wouldn't leap at a tavern simulator and in general I don't dream about games in the "Family: Food/Cooking" genre, but I imagine this is kind of going for some of that Red Dragon Inn $$$, with a bit more mechanic. Certainly looks worth a shot.

A decent attempt at being a successor to Kingsburg, but the numbers and balancing just didn't seem to add up, and there was far more "take that" than there should be in a worker placement. The sequel seems very promising in that it may do what this game attempted to do. We shall see.

The idea is very nice, but the game seems underdeveloped - it's somewhat imbalanced and random (a low die roll is not given some bonus, although it let's you do worse things than a high one).I think it will be better with the expansion, but without it there is more looks than content. It still wasn't bad, but the feeling is that it could have been a lot better.

Egyik legrettenetesebb játékélményem. Kár, mert a téma, kivitelezés szép, érdekes, ígéretes. De sajnos csak 2 órányi szenvedés lett a vége. Amikor a tonnányi szerencsét még az egymással való kiszúrással is megkoronázzák... no, az nem az én világom. Biztosan nem ülök le hozzá még egyszer, mert ha set collectiont akarok játszani, ennél ezerszer jobbak vannak, ahogyan a kockalehelyezős kategóriában is. Talán a parti kategóriában el tudnám fogadni, csak kár, hogy nem ott indul. :D
A legfájdalmasabb az, hogy gyakorlatilag folyamatosan ugyanazt kell csinálni, túl sok gondolkodnivaló nincs benne, majd amikor 3 kockalerakás után végre megszerzel néhány összetevőt a koktélhoz, valaki más ellopja tőled az egyiket... Remek móka.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

At first, it was light fun. Then it started to drag. And finally it got nasty. Kingmaking ended the game. Six players is way too many for this game which took us 3 hours to play. NEVER AGAIN!

The following aspects of the game frustrated me:

1. No ability to manipulate dice results (or very miniscule opportunity to do so) puts you at mercy of luck of the roll 
2. Recipe cards are largely luck of the draw and you can get screwed easily since you are stuck with said recipe once chosen until its fulfilled or time runs out
3. Very little opportunity to trade ingredients if you have unhelpful ingredients
4. Secret objective cards may not be balanced well
5. Kingmaking can decide a game
6. The nastiness deck gives the Waterdeep equivalent of mandatory quests but not all nastiness cards are created equal. Another random element.

Very good, thematic dice placement game.  The secret objectives, Nasty Says cards, kitchen/chore tracks, and Wizard's den ensure that choices abound on every turn.  The Mico's art is terrific and it has great table presence. As a bonus, the Wizard objective cards make for a fun solo mode as well. It uses the colored dice as a sort of automa to block spaces and manipulate the wizard's den and Nasty's effects.

I got this game as an add-on to the "Rise to Nobility" Kickstarter, so my copy is the Kickstarter Edition. I'm not sure what makes it different from the retail version, but this version is a lot of fun, and easy to learn. With three players playing for the first time, we finished the game in about 2 hours, so it doesn't take too long to play through. 

I did notice that the backs of the Secret Task cards are different than the ones pictured in the components list, which was a little confusing at first. The component list shows the card back to be a key, but the cards that I have show a door handle with a keyhole. It's possible they used different card backs for the Kickstarter edition, but  I doubt that though, because all of the other card-backs were the same as those pictured. More likely it was a hold-over from an earlier draft of the game. It's not a big deal though, because once we realized that those cards were the Secret Task cards there were no other issues. 

I would highly recommend this game to anyone, and I'm looking forward to playing Rise to Nobility. If it's anywhere near as good as Cavern Tavern, it will have been money well spent!

A fun dice-placement game based on fulfilling drinks orders in a fantasy-themed pub.  This game has high production values for a KS project.  The game is certainly improved by adding the expansion (bundled with the game) that allows more dice-manipulation.
Weight wise it definitely on the lighter side, and there's obviously a fair amount of luck involved but all in all an enjoyable experience.
Probably best played with a maximum of 4 players not a full 5 (feels a little like 5th player has been tacked on - it was a stretch goal in fairness).

This one is great as gateway as rules are simple even for somebody who is not into board games - take the order, collect components to fullfill it, get points. Can it be more simple? I had some questions about rules, but then designers released additional explanations and now it's 100% clear for me.

The theme of the game is really well executed and I really like the art. I like the combination of dice rolling and worker placement. The downside to the dice is the random factor, but I really like the extra dice for the person with the lowest score to help balance it.

hat személyes játék, melyben egy fantasy kocsmában dolgozunk, ahol elfek, törpök és hasonló lények iszogatnak különféle italokat.
Tipikus munkáslehelyezős játék azzal megcsavarva, hogy adott helyre csak adott értékű kockák értékét lehet lerakni. Így ha adott nyersanyagra fáj a fogunk, akkor mondjuk a 6-ot kell odaraknunk, amit lehet egy kockával, vagy akár többel is. Nyilván ha több értékből rakjuk ki, úgy fogy a lehetőségünk egyéb helyekre lehelyezni.
A játék jó, izgalmas, bár hat fővel 3,5 órát tartott magyarázat nélkül! Vélhetően 3-4 emberrel jóval gyorsabb.

Game with 5 players is way to long for what it is. Like the idea ea of the game but seems to be overly complicated with the amount of ingredients to choose from and the choice of drink orders portion is not a favorite with turn order/timing giving from 1 to 5 choices to players depending on where you fall in order. Lot of luck party type game that overstays its welcome at 5 people. May be better with smaller player counts.

My one problem with the game is the higher dice placements weren't worth the value to use all your dice other than that very fun worker placement
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
No way this works with 6 - the recipe area needs to be driven by the number of players with an extra slot or two not a fixed number. Limited flexibility on what you can select.
There is no way to manipulate the your dice allocation, at least for half of the game. Also very limited ways to manage what you have to fulfill.  In a dice placement game that is fatal. The item cards are intended to help mitigate seem to be more expensive than they are worth. 
There are too many different items  to collect which exasperates the dice rolling placement action.

I don't mind games that use probabilities to mange the play but this gives you nothing to work with. 

Kingsburg pulls off dice placement much better. Where I think this falls flat is too many resources to chase, Not good lead time to pursue recipes. Heavy penalties for failure with limited mitigating factors. 

Thank goodness it was someone else's copy.

We're over this game.  We tried with 2 players and thought it might be better with more.  We didn't like it with 5 players either.

It lasts [i]way[/i] too long for what it is.  It's entirely too luck dependent.  It looks beautiful, but the game play sucks.

Theme is really great here. Essentially this is very similar to Kingsburg except it feels like it could use some more refinement and playtesting. With orders being so important to earn victory points it is a little frustrating that there are not enough visible orders on the board to select from (only 2 visible in a 4 player game [other than at the start of the game] and there would be 0 in a 6 player game). There is a way for an individual player to get a larger selection of orders, but this becomes less interactive then it should be. It would have made for a more interesting mechanic if orders were all left face up on the board and players could reserve a customer (just like in a restaurant), but could still fulfill other non reserved customers that come up. This would allow for more player interactions and a higher risk of not completing your personal order. The tracks as is feel too large with too small of a payout. You also need dice manipulation, like in any dice rolling game, as soon as possible. If you ignore it and allow your opponents to get it then you'll fall behind. With the limited amount of dice and how low on the track the dice manipulation is too punishing to not pursue. Orders are seem increasingly difficult for their payout and their punishments are way too high since you'll also have to move on the Nasty track and suffer penalties there as well. To sum up: the theme is strong and great, but the mechanics and balancing still need work.

Dice worker placement/set collection with an amusing theme. I think some players might find it overly simple, but you can teach it to new players quickly, so I think it can make for a decent gateway game. I wouldn't suggest playing it without the Mrs. Nasty expansion though, as I expect the game might be a bit too random for some folks. The dice modifiers in the expansion really help.

I found this game to be quite fun.  Theme and components are great.  Luck from dice can be mitigated by accessing the other areas that just require any dice to be placed there.  Might not be able to do exactly what you want to do every round but neither will your opponents.  I did not find luck to be all that troublesome at all.

A farely complex game about serving drinks and "food" in a fantasy tavern. 
You need to keep your costumers and your boss happy! 

It´s a dice worker placement which is very interesting. 
The value of the dice you roll at the begin of your turn determens what actions you can take. It´s also interesting that you can choose to spend multiple dice to do a big action (adding the die results together) instead of multiple small ones. 
The game can be a bit long because it´s a lot to think about during your turn. But it´s usually not a problem because everybody rolls there dice at the same time and when somebody else is taking there turn you can plan and think about your own turn. 
The board is very colourful and has a lot of things to look at, so you can spend a great deal of time just watching the game and enjoying it. :)

I dont understand the harsh comment this game gets from some folks. They say there is no Dice mitigation in this game and that is just not true. If u advance on kitchen and chore tracks u get Dice modifiers. These Dice modifiers can only be used in the kitchen and the chores areas but u allways get a ingridient while putting your Dice there. 

U also have the magic potion that can be used as any other ingridient, U have the option to trade one item for Another with other players and u have the option to steal one ingridient from Another player. Ontop of this u have your own special abilities on youre character card and the special item cards. How many more options do u whant exactally? Its almost like some folks has played the game without even understanding how the game is played. 

Its a really good worker placment game with great artwork and mechanics. Happy to own the KS version and now the spirituall sequal is up on KS "Rise to nobility"

Nagyon jó téma, pár bosszantó dologgal. Az alapötlet szuper, imádtam a kis béna törpémet, ahogy csetlik-botlik az asztalok között és próbálja teljesíteni a megrendeléseket. A dice management viszont ebben a formában már többször látott elem, sok újdonságot nem hordoz. Ennek ellenére a tematika tényleg jó, de durván straightforward a köreid fele, hiszen össze kell szedned vmit, hogy abból legyen vmid. (jó, ez az eurók 90%-ra igaz, de itt vhogy nagyon kilóg a lóláb, pedig nem olyan száraz a dolog) Ez a bő 1,5 órás játékidővel megspékelve már el tudja venni az ember kedvét, de én azt javaslom, aki tud, az tegyen egy próbát vele, már csak a grafika és a poénos téma miatt is.

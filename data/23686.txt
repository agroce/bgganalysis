This is one of the 2 best party games in existence (with Wits & Wagers). A lot of fun, great components, lots of funny gifts.

The only problem is that it can be too short (only 4 rounds usually) and theres no way to extend the game.
I'm thinking about playing a fixed number of rounds in the future (6) and using hidden victory points.

Se trata de un "party game" que consiste en acertar sobre los gustos del resto de jugadores. Parece divertido en los primeros turnos, pero se vuelve repetitivo. Suele gustar más a las chicas. Los jugadores tienen que implicarse un poco para hacerlo divertido. Como juego divertido para grupos de amigos un viernes por la noche puede valer, pero yo elegiría otra cosa.

Not that bad of a party game if you are playing with people you know well enough to know what gifts they'd like.  It's a big hit with non-gamers in my family, so it's a good choice when you can't bring out anything more complicated.

it is a funny game and simple to get into.  the board could have been designed a bit better: we kept moving the wrong bits the wrong way.  You can know someone and wield that as an advantage, but really it's a guessing game.

This game has dropped a bit for me.  It's still fun, but it can be massively frustrating to be so close to winning, and yet you keep getting knocked back at the last second.  For the first three or four rounds, the game is a lot of fun.  After that, it gets tedious...to me.  A lot of friends really like it, so it will keep coming out.  I still recommend it over many party games.

UPDATE: I think the experiences to be had with this game make it an OK game to pull out once in a while.  It's still frustrating that turn order can cause the game to extend beyond the point of it being fun any more.

Had a great time playing - not just the game (I had to think) but there was plenty of chat and a few surprises about what people do - or don't want.  The game itself is beautifully packaged snd easy to comprehend.  the pictue cards show a great range of gifts, from the awful to the fabilous.when first played it seemed a simple game but with time has shown there is more depth to it.   Certainly no two games are the sameTotally different to Carcassonne/Ticket to Ride/ Alhambra, but holds its own against them in terms of fun we had playing.  Better with more players then 3.Will certainly play at get togethers

Very fun game for a dinner party.  Everyone quickly understood the rules and the general premise of the game.  I think we all enjoyed some of the mixed reactions or even when someone says, "wow, you really don't know me".  We're planning another dinner party (as soon as the kitchen renovation is complete) and Gift Trap will definitely be on the agenda.  I can't say that I recommend it too much for kids but adults of any age have a blast.

I was surprised to find that I liked playing this game OK, even though I was the sole person in the group who knew the fewest other players well (and thus did end up last). Most gift giving or getting was meh, but there was at least one moment of fun or surprise each round.

It's no dixit, but it's rare to get a game that has a modicum of strategy that seats 8 players.

This game seems to be all fancy and no substance to me.  I really did not like it very much.  The first couple rounds were fun and sort of unique feeling, but it died really quick.  People started saying.  This is it?  This is all we do... over and over?  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
We've found this easier to score just using a pad of paper and keeping a positive/negative column for both giving and receiving (ie, ignore the board score track).  We often play a set number of rounds, as opposed to playing toward a target score.  A great, light game for playing with family and close friends.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Top notch components aren't enough to save this party game.  Choosing how to distribute the gifts seems like it would be fun, but the mechanisms kill the enjoyment.  And they even include bonus cards so you can make the game worse.  The most widely hated aspect of this game is probably the scoring which can be terribly fiddly.  Even if you have one person handling each side of the scoreboard confusion can still arise.  It just seems like it would be better in a light party game like this for the scoring to be more intuitive.  The other problem in the game is the fact that it feels like it wants to be a get-to-know-each-other game, but it penalizes not knowing the other players.  But even with people you know there will arise moments when someone gives a gift that another player ranked as "No Way" and this can lead to bickering over why they would give that gift or why the receiving player would hate that gift.  A party game that prompts more bickering than smiling is a humongous failure.  I only keep this game because I have family members who like it, for some unknown reason.  I do not recommend it!

In GiftTRAP, you assign gifts to your friends from a possible group, and try to match their likes.  To win, you have to be a good giver and receiver of gifts.

I'll admit it, I only ever bring this out around Christmas anymore, but we all have an absolute blast playing it every time.  I will never, ever win and I am at peace with that.  Always, always fun - the best party game I own by a large margin.

I am on a quest to find a party game worthy of playing for an entire night with re-playability.

26, Dec. 2010
This is the best party game that I have played yet. The theme about gift giving and receiving works wonders for holyday sessions. We played 4 times back to back, pretty uncommon for our group. I wonder about re-playability though.

I start with a rating of [-]8[/-]

We played with 8 people last night and it was a bit slow and chaotic. The fact that half of them I met for the first time also added to not enjoy the session. Definitely a game meant to be played by friends.

Absolutely bags of fun. The people playing need to know each other a little and the scoring (giver and receiver both score for the gift, but on different tracks) can confuse non-gamers. None the less, the game in its entirety is "choose which of these gifts to give to each person round the table, then decide which ones you want most yourself". Any game that can be completely described in one sentence is so simple that anyone can pick it up. Perfect for family occasions and dinner parties, but you must play this with a crowd who can laugh about it. If Auntie Mabel will take offence when you give her the face lift or the month at the fat camp, then play something else.

Personally, I still can not believe my wife and son thought I would prefer a leaf-blower to a baseball mitt or a 10-pin bowling party.

RATING: 8
There are many worse games than Gift Trap but there are also many more better: easily put, this is a bearable party game for non gamers, one you could play once with a good number of close friends and then place on the shelf again for the next handful of months with no regret.

Close friends are required, for they only would know each other well enough to guess the tastes and preferences of the others: and even so there’s a good chance one may completely miss them. All in all, it’s a pretty boring and frustrating game. (September 2011)

[b]Update I[/b] - After further playing it I’ve made up my mind about Gift Trap: it can be moderately fun if played with a suitable group. 

What does «suitable» mean is still debatable though: some argue Gift Trap works better with people who aren’t too close, because this makes the guessing harder; others (and I put myself among those) say it gives its best when the players have some familiarity with each other, because the game helps them know one another better while still allowing enough surprises: this also encourages table talk and jokes, which aren’t advisable when the players have only just known each other.

Behind each opinion is a different gamestyle: the more analytical, success-oriented, play-always-to-win gamers will favor the former whereas the play-only-to-have-fun-and-meet-your-friends lighter-side gamers seem to like the latter better. Anyhow, Gift Trap suits everyone, mainly the non-gamers.

This pondered, in July 2012 I raised my rating slightly from 5 to 6. (July 2012)

[b]Update II[/b] - Over the last year Gift Trap has gained a solid grip on my favorites list as it’s a light-hearted party game that fosters mirth and jokes among the players: undoubtedly it’s the perfect gateway game that even non-gamer women (usually the most difficult to persuade into joining a group to play with) seem to like and enjoy.

All I had to do to make it fun was to dump the official rules and switch to a set of home-rules: scrap the «every turn, every players gives and receives gifts from every other player» part and switch it to «every turn, the active player changes: he’s now the only one who’ll receive the gifts all the other players will give him». This makes the game much more lively and full of laughs.

Anyhow, even with this variant, depending on the group you’re playing with, Gift Trap can still be either a hit or a flop: as it usually goes, to enjoy it entirely the players - or at least some of them - need to let themselves go.

Thanks to the new home-rules, in October 2013 I raised my rating from 6 to 8.

A solid party game.  Played once with a family of five, which made the giving a little too easy and the game was over in two turns (we reset and played once more).  The scoring can be frustrating because this is a party game where you really do want to pay attention to the scores.  Scoring on a separate piece of paper may be a better option.  I'm looking forward to trying it both with more people and with people I don't know as well.

This one is really amusing! It's a great variation, and overall huge improvement, on the "Apples to Apples" style game, with a lot of fun to be had with the gifts, and the components are quite beautiful. 

Only gripe (and the one that led to it leaving the collection) is the scoring system is a bit obtuse, and for a party game to play with non-gamers, that complexity always felt like a barrier to entry.

Fun little party game.  Want to get some more games in, with more people.  Worried that that will just get too confusing, but maybe the game will last a bit longer.  With 4 people we seem to be done in 3 or 4 rounds.  Just too fast.  Want to clarify what I mean by too fast.  Just because it is over in 3 rounds. (Happened the same with 4 players and 6 players)  The scoring portion takes too long to figure out.

What a fun, unique party game. This is a game that will have everyone laughing, and can spark genuinely interesting conversation. I can see it being a great way to get to know people better. The production is nothing short of lavish. The box is clever and the everyone loves the little gift bags. The board could be a bit higher quality though. The only issue is that with people who know each other well the game is pretty much guaranteed to end in a tie (usually multiple ties). The advanced cards help this somewhat, but also make the game a bit more fiddly. I can also see the turns going on a bit too long with more than about 6 people. All in all though, a must-have party game.

I must say I find the exclusive cards to the multiple editions/printings of this game infuriating, though. I'd have much preferred (and would have shelled out money for) small expansion packs.

GiftTRAP is one of the better party games I've played, which is not quite damning with faint praise. I've searched for a good bit to find a decent party game, and most are a bit disappointing. But, with GiftTRAP, pretty much everyone can get into the theme of giving and getting gifts. Given the sheer diversity of cards in the box (ranging from a lava lamp, to personal tennis lessons, to your own cryogenic chamber), there's a ton of replayability.

The one knock on this game is that you need to play with a group that has some familiarity, otherwise the gift giving and getting is pure speculation. We've gotten a decent number of plays with this during the holidays, and there's a chance I bust this out with friends if we don't want to think too much.

Update: Eventually sold this one away. That's not exactly incriminating for the game. It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do. I just don't have an audience for party games, and this one was just collecting dust after my family graduated to more complex games.

Great party game for people who know each other or want to know each other. Tuned out to be fun to play but winning is not really an objective, it is just the time that you decide to play some more or go home.  Some good opprotunitied to throw in a "ringer" on your wife and make her blush.

Bought to give and play with Mother-in-Law.  She enjoyed it very much.  Wish the X-Rated cards didn't have normal items on the backs of them.  Otherwise, went over very great.

Found thrifting for $6.00 at GW new in shrink in March 2008.  Now wife has a copy too.

This is one of my daughter's favorite games.  Teaches how to be thoughtful of other people's feelings/interests as well.

This is a very light party game that's great fun for a group of friends.  Who knew that Greg wanted to learn to play the steel drums?  The strategy here is minimal, but the laughs are big.  My only caution is this might not be as enjoyable for a group just getting to know each other.  For that you're better off choosing Apples to Apples.

Components: Garish board, unattractive photographs, unrounded card corners, but with neat player gift bags and gift pawns. Adult-themed cards are mixed in with the regular cards, making for some uncomfortable moments as cards are dealt out in a family setting.

Experience: It is somewhat fun to guess what players would like to receive, and to rank my own preferences; it is also fun to debate someone's choices afterward. The points awarded/penalized for receiving gifts seems to be to ensure that players make honest choices about what they'd like to receive, which is a needed incentive, but it also means that a player can never win if the group doesn't know them well. With fewer players, the negative points can often entirely counteract the positive points, leading to a very long game. With more players, there is too much chaos on the main board to be able to follow what is happening (and therefore get to know people better), and to ensure everyone is scored correctly.

Played with good friends who all know each other very well so I thought it'd be fun. It wasn't.
The gifts are generally either too specific or too bland.
The scoring is way too fiddly and each round comes to a screeching halt while you try to figure out each person's score.

We didn't even finish the game before people had wandered off.

It's a great concept of a game and should have been a lot of fun, but it failed miserably with my group.

I like the concept, but the mechanics are a bit heavy and seem to get in the way of the fun part; talking about the gifts you would (or would not) like to get.  

For a party game, there are many others that I enjoy more.  In fact, this "party game" has so many rules and intricacies on the scoring track that I can only play it with gamers.  Heck, not being able to play with non-gamers takes away the while reason why IU like party games.

RATING: 8
Fun party game where knowing the preferences of others is key to winning, but (as with most party games) winning is not really the point of playing.  Rating as a 3-7 player party game only.  With 8 the game seems to bog down with the focus being more on scoring than on the fun of the game.

We had a blast the first time we played. Great original concept for a party game.

A few complaints: My copy (a newer edition) did NOT have any of the adult cards, and since we only use this game with adults in a drinking party setting, I was disappointed not to have them. The board is about as ugly as a board can be, it was terribly busy. I was also annoyed that the cards had another language written on them (just added to the clutter).

Otherwise, it is still a keeper!

An "okay" party game. It helps if you know the people you are playing with as you are trying to give the perfect gift to the right person while creating your own wishlist of gifts. However, most gamers boil it down to trying to guess what gifts people are giving them while trying to figure out what gifts people want. Also, some people get confused about the dual-pieces movement.

The balance between giving and receiving gifts is cleverly done. A good gift giver will not win if their friends cannot pick the right gift for them. This is a game for friends and family , but in a way this limits replay, since after a couple of games, you'll see either the same gift you know somebody really likes/hates, or you'll get a trend for their tastes. But it's still a great way to discover new things about people (you wanted GUNS??).

This is another game such as Apples to Apples where it is an ideal party/family game where you know the people.  (Don't enjoy at all with people I don't know.) There is light strategy to winning, yet from young to old, with a wide range of mental capabilities, all you have to do is hand out a card to each player and place a few tokens on the board.  Lots of fun and surprises.

GiftTRAP balancerer på grænsen til at være en selskabsleg. I GiftTRAP  forsøger alle spillere ud fra et udvalg af virtuelle gaver bedst muligt at matche disse med de øvrige spilleres ønsker. Man bedømmes såvel på sin evne til at gætte hvilke gaver de øvrige spillere er mest interesseret i som at modtage gaver fra de øvrige spillere, der er i overensstemmelse med ens egne ønsker. De mulige gaver tages på skift fra forskellige bunker, hvor gaverne i hver bunke har nogenlunde samme værdi. I én bunke kan gaverne f.eks. være rejser til eksotiske lande og store oplevelser som en prøvetur med en rumraket mens en anden bunken primært indeholder billigt skrammel hvoraf det meste nok af mange vil blive betragtet som hadegaver. Hver runde er der ni gaver, der kan fordeles mellem de øvrige spillere og hver gave kan naturligvis kun gives én gang af hver spiller. Da der kan være op til otte spillere i spillet og hver spillere udover at lave en top-tre liste over de gaver de helst vil have også hemmeligt har udpeget en gave, de i hvert tilfælde ikke vil have og som man bliver straffet for at give dem, er det slet ikke så let hverken at blive en god gave-giver eller modtager, som det måske lyder. Et rigtig hyggeligt spil, der vækker stor moro og kan spilles i de fleste typer af selskaber. Et spil i en genre, jeg sjældent kaster mig over, men som varmt kan anbefales.

GiftTRAP has been a moderate hit for me in casual settings such as with my extended family or with non-game-loving friends - especially my female friends, who unsurprisingly seem to be the better shoppers in this game.  I guess I must be hard to shop for, because although I often do well at the "giving" portion of the game, I often trail the pack on the "getting" score track.  Note to self: be less mysterious.

I recommend GiftTRAP to anyone who isn't immediately put off by the idea of a game about choosing appropriate gifts for the other players around the table.  Save it for occasions in which the players all know each other reasonably well.

For this game to shine, you need to designate two attentive and accurate scorekeepers. One will move the "getting" markers and the other will move the "giving" markers. Having one person do both leads to mistakes, and leaving the scoring to the group at large is not recommended because you want to keep the scoring as painless and non-intrusive as possible.

Fun party game of trying to guess which gifts your opponents would like, and hoping they give you the gifts you want.  Best when played with folks you know.

There isn’t much strategy here, but that is not the point.  Trying to guess which gifts your fellow players desire is the entire point of the game.  Gift Trap is simply fun, and evokes continuous outbursts of surprise, frustration and laughter as gifts are revealed.  The game is best when played with friends and family, otherwise it is truly little more than guess work.  Within the confines of a family gathering or get-together with friends, however, the game truly shines.  Gift Trap is truly a gift worth giving or getting!

this actually belongs to my wife, who received it from her favorite gamer geek! :-D

this is a really fun game to play with friends.  need to know the other players you are playing with.  players have two pawns, one for the gift giving scoring track and one for the gift receiving track.  cards picturing different gifts are layed on the board (dealing out a number of cards equaling the number of players 
 1).  each player decides which gift to give to each of the other players.  sometimes the choices are limited and you have to compromise.  then you secretly rank the gifts with tokens (rankings are 'great', 'good', 'ok', and 'no way').  then each player takes a turn "opening their gifts."  If you receive a gift that you want you, and the giver, get points each on the respective scoring tracks.  The more you want the gift the more points you score.  If someone gives you a no-way gift, it's negative 4 points.  If you didn't put a token on it it's -1 points.  First player to make it to the end of the give and receiver tracks wins the game.

It is recommended that you play with people that you know so you know what makes them tick.  Had a great time playing with my in-laws (married 30  years) and watching them give each other gifts they didn't want.  :D lots of laughs!

Thanks to Scott Nicholson for bringing this one to my attention.  It's a game that both my wife and I like.

Haven't played yet, but it seems a fiddly version of Whoknew, Whonoo?

Both games are absolutely interchangeable.

Later:

It is fun, but definitely fiddly. 

Kids will be turned off by the fiddliness and confusion. With adult supervision and direction they should be able to play fine though.
We played with (+ or -) poker chips instead of the scoring board. We played with seven players and it was way too confusing for them.

Instead of everyone giving and receiving at the same time, it could be done with one player at a time (like Apples2Apples or Whoonoo.) This would reduce some of the confusion for the smaller kids.

Or simply don't have as many players when playing with kids.

I would play this again any time - it is certainly fun. There are obvious design flaws, though (namely the order in which you flip over tiles - particularly in the three player version -, but other things as well); the rules aren't well written, the graphic design isn't good. So no more than a 7 from me.

May09: My opinion is only so great at the moment.  It's a "know thy friend" game.  But it just doesn't do that great of job of promoting conversation.

The scoring is also just about atrocious.  It's a party game people, it's supposed to be easy.  I had a tough time keeping it straight.

It does occasionally force you to decide who to give the awesome gift too, but more often than not it rewards you for being predictable.  I'm not as excited about party games that reward you for being predictable.

It's a great game with an interesting concept: you have to be both a good giver and a good receiver to win. Unfortunately it seems to be a little slow and fiddly with more people, and a little limited with fewer people.

For some reason, scoring was very confusing the one time I played this and the way it was marked on the board didn't help. Could have been exacerbated by the fact that we played with 7 players, so the board was crowded (information overload). This game reminds me a lot of the old TV game show The Newlywed Game. Play only with good friends as I think people could be easily insulted if they don't go into this with a sense of humor.

Like any game relying on personalities, you need to know your opponents pretty well. And like those games, the people with the strongest traits will score faster. Barring those observations, GiftTRAP is a clever, welcome addition to this genre, with a good interface.

RATING: 6
A pretty good original party game that is somewhat group depandant, it is probably better to know the people you are playing with but maybe not too well as choices could be too obvious sometimes, still not knowing the people in the game is the least ideal setting.  

The game is fun as there are some good interesting questions and discussions that come from them, also fun is learning about what makes some people tick as you can't help discovering some things about the people who you play with and also discovering what you 'thought' you knew which was wrong. 

Replay value is a little questionable within the same group as the cards become known. A good unique and fun party game that is easy to learn and teach for occasional play, playing in the right/ideal situation the rating would be more like a 7 or 8

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2011)

GiftTrap is a great Party/Family game. This is not my usual kind of game, in fact some friends mocked me for buying this, but I really enjoy it when I play it. I generally play it with non-gamers (my family) but also with some regular gamers who like the game. GiftTrap is like no other game I have played, it is very novel and creative, perhaps it works best with groups of people who know each other, but it also works as an ice breaker with unfamiliar people. The game components are gorgeous. 

When I play, I seem to do the “gifting” part very well, but receiving gifts is hard for me (or for my friends :D) so I lost most of the time.

I want to play it again soon.

After another couple of games, I still continue to love this. I have only played with the basic rules, not with the cards. I will read the rules soon and add them to my next game. I also love that the game can accommodate 8 players with no fuzz.

Great game, I won´t ever sell it.

I love the game, I think is great. 

On the other hand I played with the “advanced” rules but they are pretty easy. In general I dislike them because I feel that attacking/blocking players detract from the spirit of the game. I don’t think I will play with them again.

This is a light party game with an interesting theme/presentation and a scoring system that requires you to be good at both knowing what gifts to give others, but also to have them know what you think is best.

It is not one of those yelling/screaming games (from what I can tell so far), but a thoughtful lighthearted "hey that was pleasant" kinda game.  I would definately play this with non-gamers or casual gamers, but not gamers' gamers.

Bought this off of a recommendation from Board Games with Scott.  After several plays I'm underwhelmed.  Guess Scott and I have different opinions.  The strategy of trying to figure out what people will buy you and what to give removes the fun of actually giving people gifts based on what they want - you end up playing for points instead of playing honestly.  Scoring is awkward at best, boring and too complex for sure.  Best if you hand pick the gifts to make them all awkward or inappropriate.

Overall - this purchase was a bust.

I think this is a fun game to play with the family. It is creative the way you score points both for giving gifts that people want and for receiving gifts that you want. There are a wide variety of gift items on cards at four different price points to choose from. Only one price point is played at a time. The only issue was scoring on the two tracks for getting and giving sometimes got a little confusing.

I'm not too into party games, mainly because I'm not too into being loud or raucous.  But I've found GiftTRAP to be very enjoyable.  The production quality is very high, greatly adding to the experience.  My one caveat is the board, which because of its weird folds, ends up  with severe indentations/bumps at the creases when unfolded.  The gifts are fun and well thought-out.  It helps to know other people well, but I would imagine that it could also help to get to know someone better.

Perhaps my favourite party game. Knowing people you play with may be helpful, but you will also have to be able to read people. "Gifts" like Vasectomy and Nose-Job make it sometimes even really hard to choose which of the players have to receive possibly negative gifts.

RATING: 4
This is a kind of quiz game about how well you know the interests of the other people at the table. There is little if any strategy (as I define it). Perhaps it could work as a Newlywed Game variant where the theme is testing how well you know your friends. The game is quite long for what it is as it seems to take forever to reveal each player's score. This was particularly problematic in my eight player game. My rating here is mostly indicative of my lack of interest in party games. It may appeal to others, particularly if you have a smaller number of players. Rating for 8 players: 3

RATING: 8
Presents are listed on cards. You try to match each player with a present that they rate highly. You have to score in both giving the correct presents, and in receiving the right presents.

The Good: Fun party game. Some good laughs about why poeple gave or chose particular presents. Some people received the same gift from everyone, and of course it was something they hated. I have this crazy notion that it might actually help some relatives choose better gifts for you !

The Bad: Our game ran a little long for what it was - no one could quite complete in both receiving AND giving. Might need to lower the winning score next time. Also, probably best with mixed sexes as there are obvious male-only and female-only presents.

THE UGLY: You will have a hard time talking men into playing this game. It seems to have been designed with a bridal shower in mind. Each players components are stored in a very feminine bag. The confusing thing about this is that there are male-only presents included.

This game might have been enjoyable enough were it not for two major flaws. (1) because scoring is both positive and negative, it's possible for the game to never end.  (2) If several people all like and dislike the same things [i]and you know[/i] their tastes, you can still only make a couple of them happy while the rest drag down your score.  Blech!

Nice party game of giving and getting presents.  It's a lot of fun and easy to understand, but it needs to be played by people who all share the same level of previous knowledge about each other.  It can work with a group that barely knows each other (as an ice breaker about first impressions) or with a group that has known each other for a long time (as a real test of how well they know each other), but don't mix these people together.

A social getting-to-know-you party game.  This game seems to end too early and I wish it was twice as long with large groups.  I think taking out the +3 points disc would prolong the game for more rounds while still maintaining balance and the integrity of the game.  Part of the fun is talking about why people chose what and gave what and it seems too short for two rounds with large groups.

Very nicely packaged game w/good components, though the card stock is a tad thin.  Overall, a pretty entertaining and unique game.  I think there are some issues w/it though as rules on scoring are very vague.  Also, in the two games I've played, we've had ties w/no way to resolve them.  Advanced card game options have potential to either improve or detract from game (really, it almost depends on the game/round itself.)  Games were fun but the end was a let-down each time.  I'd play this but the authors really need to refine the scoring rules a tad.  And why the heck should you get penalized b/c someone gives you a bad gift?  Sort of odd.  This game likely works best w/more players than few.  8 is probably best.  However, it can get really confusing keeping track on all the different colored scoring markers on two scoring tracks (and all those tokens.  ugh.)

Didn't like this at first, but for a party/social game, it's growing on me. Several "gifts" are laid out on the board and each player secretly decide which gift they will give to whom, as well as secretly ranking preference for the gifts they'd like to receive. Players then reveal their tiles and move on the "gifts given" track for every gift they gave a player who wanted to receive that gift and move on the "gifts received" track for every gift they received that they actually wanted. A little tricky on the scoring tracks, but a fun "get to know you" game for friends or family.

Though I unwittingly wound up with the California edition as the result of a trade, it's still pretty fun -- we just have to pretend that we actually LIVE there so that the location cards aren't considered to be a trip from mid-America PLUS whatever weird present is on them.

One complaint: the board is crazy confusing. We always have a few moments in each game when someone moves the wrong present the right way or the right present the wrong way.

Ok for a party game. Funny though, despite being published by a proper board game publisher in Finland (the best there is), the rules are still typical party game rules with holes in them. Did they run the rules through a special party game filter?

A great party game, though I would think that it's best for either groups that don't know each other very well (though this may make for a long game!) or those that know each other very well.  When you have a few people who know each other well and a couple of people who aren't "in the know," it can get a bit boring to those not in the in-crowd.

Probably my very favourite party game, and the only party game I've bought in years. Players secretly choose from 9 photographs each round which gifts they'd give to the others in the group, and then rate which gifts they'd like to receive. Players earn points for guessing which gifts their friends want as well as for receiving the gifts they want themselves (being easy to shop for, so to speak). Fits great with a Christmas party theme.

With the right group, this game is just flat-out fun. It generates a lot of good discussion regarding what we like and don't like, what we value, etc. I thought it would only be good for people who all know each other, but the one time we played it with my buddy's new girlfriend, she won without knowing anybody else at the table!

In this party game, attempt to predict what others want for gifts, and select what you want as a gift. The gifts are selected from cards, with 4 decks of cards for variety. You select 4 different gifts, with different levels of desire for the gifts. You score more points for matching the right gifts with the right person, and conversely you could lose more points for selecting the wrong gift. The components are nice, it's a good change of pace, and easy to play. Best played with people you know, and with a large number of people. 

It is a fun game, but the rules could be written a bit better. Also, when a person looks at what the others gave them, it does matter in which order you do it, since your token cannot advance beyond the finish line, and you could lose points, so the order in which you reveal gifts is a factor. It is a decent party game, quite socialable, and has a nice idea, but doesn't stack up to other party games like Apples to Apples.

Another party game for 4 ( not 8!) that relies on the awkwardness of the git giving situation.  In this case the gift receiving of gifts that you don't want.  the game mechanics is weak and pushes the game play with limited options. The production is weak as well with stock photos on cards of the gifts.  At best play with people that you personally know well.

Yeah, the scorekeeper has to be sharp as a tack, but this party game is a pure winner, whether with people you know well or with people you just met (so long as they are non-aspy). It's fun as an activity more than a game to be won, in the same league as True Colors and Eat Poop You Cat.

Extremely annoying game. I hate the feeling when you get something as a present that you're not too fond of and trying to look like it's the best present in the world. Or vice versa, you give something to someone and you can read the disappointment in their body language. Hate it.

I can see that this game can be fun but it is not for me.

RATING: 6
First impression (4 players): It's a party "game" alright. You're trying to guess which presents your friends like. Get it right and you get gift giving points. If others know your taste well, get gift receiving points. In right circumstances it might be fun but it's a pastime more than a game. Update: Actually can be quite fun when played with close friends & family.

WARNING: Rating if playing with semi-unknown people: 3. There isn't much point if you don't know others at least pretty well. Might work as an ice breaker in some situations with stranger people but ....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A reasonably short party game, but there's lots of downtime during the scoring. Unlike most party games, this one is not annoying, and it actually manages to be quite fun occasionally. Anyway, feels more like a mass-market game than a modern board game, and I would not suggest this in a gamer-only environment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.9
Pretty good game when taken in the context of a party game.  Good mechanics for ensuring other players genuinely select gifts they would like.  The $$$$ (Highest Value) gift catagory is weak, as the difference in value between items is too great.  Also, some non-realistic items ("ability to fly") throw off the guess factor significantly.

Overall, a good game to own if you're having a party or a mixed group over to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Because it fits a very specific need (a game that can be played around the holidays, instead of playing 'dirty Santa') this game would be more highly rated if not for the quirky scoring system. It just slows things down too much. And because I will really only ever play this with causal gamers, or non-gamers, having an unnecessarily complicated scoring system is a real drawback. However, when I've run the game for others, handling the scoring without actually playing, it has gone well, and everyone has always seemed to enjoy it.

I like this game.  It is fun.  But I find the fiddlyness (is that a word?) of the game takes a bit away from it.

It is still quite fun and I would happily play it again.

Tried to play this with 6 adults ages 45-55 who we know somewhat.  The gameboard scoring mechanics made it very tedious. After one round we had to take a break and invent a totally new way to play it as a card game.  Much more fun if you deal 10 cards per person (some cards from each deck). Object is to get rid of your cards and collect gifts you really like. One at a time a player can offer a gift from their hand to another player until someone turns down their gift. Person who gives the most gifts and receives the most gifts wins.

Oh please! This isn't even a game. Only a means to spend some time. The game is way too much overproduced and the winning conditions stupid. I think the scoring system from -4 to 3 is really great but that scoring track and the fact that the game can potentially last forever is a big downside for me.

It's fun to see what some people would choose among the given alternatives but it's not fun enough to last through one game. I think that younger kids would love this as a party game.

This game wants to be funny, but I didn't feel it worked well.  It felt like it was trying too hard to make you have a good time.  The ideas are clever, I respect it, I just felt like it fell flat.

Es un gran party game, dudo que haya partida de este juego sin risas, conversaciones memorables, reproches, sorpresas y lo mejor de todo, conocer mejor a la gente. Muy divertido y de aspecto visual genial.

Como contras le pongo que suelen haber preferencias a la hora de dar regalos, muchas veces hay gente que se queda con la "morralla" de los regalos que nadie a dado aún, porque son los peores lo cual resta puntos. Y otra es que es mejor jugar con gente que conoces ya que sabes mejor que regalar.

I fail to see why the designers chose to punish the player who has [i]other people[/i] guessing wrong when giving them gifts. It is hard to come back from multiple people whiffing on your presents.

It is a lot of fun if played with people you know good enough. If you know them too good there will be less fun since you can attribute the gifts too easily.

With my family it was a silly really fast game. My youngest sister won it in three turns. With a bunch of folks that don't know each other it turned into a long slog of a game. The game plays best with 5 good friends. Watch out for some of the gift cards that could be considered insulting or too personal, e.g. liposuction or marriage counseling.

A winner!

RATING: 6
Great production values and a nice idea, but the execution falls flat. Since in this game you get punished for playing with people who you don't know very well and rewarded for playing with people you do (so you know, what gifts they want and vice versa), the game doesn't really encourage playing with a new group of people to get to know them better, which for me is what a party game should be all about. Sure, you I can also play with people I know well, but then I'd rather play some meatier games than party games. On the flipside, when playing with new people, the groans usually come from how inappropriate some of the gifts end up being. We played yesterday and I can only imagine what a girl must have felt, when almost everyone gifted her a "total makeover". Or the guy, who was gifted "dog walking service" but rated it as "no way!". The person who gave the gift asked "But I though you had a dog?". The guy replied "My dog died a while ago". Yeah, I think I won't be keeping this particular party game.

Update: Originally rated years ago, I was planning to sell it, but instead bought the "adult toys" expansion to it. Today, I gifted a "boob job" to a girl with a flat chest. Turns out, that out of nine possible gifts, that was the only one she rated as "no way", resulting in minus four points for both of us. Awkward moments aside though, I guess I am starting to warm up to the game. Very slowly though apparently. I am still not perfectly happy with it, but I guess I will keep it just a little while longer.

Is it better to give than to receive?  Why not do both!  Fun game that questions how well you know the other players.  Light, easy to explain, and amusing.  I won't be returning this present.

Played once.  This went over pretty well with some friends from church (not gamers).  My biggest caveat is that with 8 people the scoring was kind of slow.  Might be better with 4-6.  Also I plan to skip the "cheap" cards as the expensive ones seem more fun to speculate about.

Reminds me of a game from the '80's called Personal Preference where you had to rank four cards containing people, food, objects, etc. according to how well you think you know your opponent.  That game covers more categories than just gifts, but I like the way the scoring works here, although some house rules for breaking ties are needed.  One of the more interesting game boxes I have seen!

Another variant of the popular Apples to Apples game. In this game, instead of choosing the best card, you choose the best gifts! The one upside to this game is to see the huge variety of gifts and to see what your friends truly desire. This game works very well in smaller groups (4-5 players) but does not work well in larger groups (7-8 players) as the game gets way too confusing (you have too many gift options and too many players to give gifts to) and may entice players to just randomly give gifts.

Similar to games like Dixit, this game can easily lose its charm once you have seen all the available gifts that the game has to offer, thankfully the game has a huge amount of gifts.

Like a well-chosen gift, this game was a very pleasant surprise that experienced an early rapid rise in the ranks of our party games, only to be bumped down again by others, such as the crazy "Quelf".  Appropriately enough, it saw a LOT of play over the first Christmas/New Year's season in which it was purchased.  Everything about the game is so well done, from the perfect production which utilizes hundreds of photographs to make up the gifts, to the fun and easy game play, to the fact that some of the proceeds from the game go to a charitable organization.  The only minor quibble I have (Is "quibble" a word?  It must be since FireFox didn't underline it in red - although it did underline "FireFox"...) is that an eight-player game in which many of the participants don't know each other very well can go on indefinitely.  But other than that, as long as you have at least three other people to play with you, you're almost guaranteed to have fun with this one.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

[GiftTRAP Enterprises 06 edition] {Party, social; voting, simultaneous-action; optimal 6-8p} {basic 6.5, expert 6.5} GiftTRAP is a novel, interesting and attractive social game. It allows player to understand each much more. Well, it's even more interesting if you are playing with your girl friend or wife!

To start the games, I think the Yellow/Blue decks are better.

The expert rules are not really necessary. They don't add much to strategies or fun. 

The high-grade components are stunning though it becomes more difficult to stack!

This is a good try for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

This is not a serious game, it's a party game, but I like it. I love thinking which gift to give to people and I definately want to know what they think I would like.

Party game. The player that knows the other player AND those other players know them has the advantage. If you're a simple person (you like anything about sports) then you'll do well when people give you gifts. If you're not, then people can guess wrong and things can really hurt. You can either play it to win (guess what people are going to give you and then put your big points there) or play it to let people know you better.

GiftTrap is the gift-giving game that may be too gamer-y for its own good. Although scoring on both the give and get actions sounds logical, in practice it is way too confusing. A better production design might help. The math uses up so much brain power that it can be difficult to glean actual nuggets of insight from friends.  And bad guesses yield nuclear bad points, so this game is impossible to play with strangers.  It's a great fit for a tight-kint group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A fantastic party game concept, though be sure someone is super-familiar with the rules and can help people along, as the placement of the various Love It / Hate It tokens can get fiddly fast, especially with a lot of players.

RATING: 7
Good party game, quick game. Much "nicer" but less intense than e. g. True Colors. Plays with 8 (but takes too long then, my rating is for a three to five players game). Good entertainment for a short time, but not for a whole evening of course. Gameplay may be confusing with all bits and pieces that must be placed and moved - especially the two victory points ladders require some concentration. This game will probably not be any fun if you play for the winning.

RATING: 6.5
A party game, but a terrible game as a "mixer". You have to know the people you are playing with or everything is just a big fat guess and the game plays waaaay too long.

I do like this game more than the rating suggests.  It's just that it has to be with a group of people I know well and we have to be in a playful mood.

The problem with this game is that it needs more cards.  The game loses a lot o replayability without fresh cards.

I have had some great times with family and GifTRAP, though.

P.S.  The scoring really is not that difficult.  Once you see it done once it is very clear.

Update: Perfect Present is a game that can be found cheaply on eBay and the cards work perfectly. A lot of the presents are more fantastical (invisibility, etc). Even if you haven't seen all of the presents in the original, Perfect Present can be a nice way to breath new life into GifTrap.

Update: I think this might play best with 4. Three might be too few, but the more people the longer it takes and 8 people can make this go too long.

Update: rating moves from 6.5 to 7.5. I have been playing this with 4-5 people and the presents from Perfect. Present and have loved this more than ever. I would play with more than 5 but feel 4-5 is the sweet spot. I would be less enthusiastic to play with the original presents, however. The Perfect Present gifts are much more fun.

Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1.75

Unusual game with attractive presentation. I've only played once, but based on that I'd recommend it as best for a mid-size group (4-6)of people who know each other fairly equally (all know each other casually, or all know each other pretty well). Some of the items may be a little risque for some groups, but these could be removed from the game and still leave plenty of options.

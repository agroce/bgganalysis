Started playing in 6th edition.
8th edition is an excellent addition to the series with streamlined rules and a fantastic number of varied game types.

8th is the easiest 40k ruleset to get into. The game is quite deep, although the internal balancing issues put forth by the producer can skew the game quite a bit

I can't believe I bought this.

The stories these games tell are just too good.

I'm a casual player at best (who builds narrative lists) and resent the competitive players (who build lists purely for the win).

The 8th Edition of Warhammer 40,000 brought back some much needed life by turning the previous rules in 7th on its head. As a result, it's equalized the playing field significantly and armies that were once unplayable in the competitive scene are now coming back with renewed strength.

Games Workshop have dropped an absolute gem when this edition of the game. A far simpler less complicated system that still has strong tactics and styles of play. Much better than previous editions and more balanced.

My friend and I got into the 7th edition of the game, and although we weren't thrilled about having to buy new books, this version seems to be much better.

[u]Armies (so far)[/u]: [-]Astra Militarum[/-] Imperial Guard, Dark Angels, Tau

Mechanically there are much better games but the 8th edition is fun, fast, furious and overall the best experience Games Workshop has ever produced. The universe is still great and the lore is actually going forward now. This is the new golden age of 40k and the best time to get into the hobby as a new or returning player.

8th edition is the one that finally got me all the way into 40k after 35 years of playing other miniatures wargames. Had a false start with a previous edition, have always liked the lore. Lots of factions and factions within factions to choose from. Xenos/Chaos menace or the Imperium of Man. I'm having a blast with this game and since I understood the drawbacks (mostly cost) going in I've rated it highly. I'm not comparing it with previous editions since I don't have much experience with those.

The core rules are simple, the complexity comes in with a stat line and special rules all units have but the way they are presented along with the effects still don't add up to a ton of brain melting rules. Gameplay flows well and doesn't take up a whole day. The battles can get brutal quickly and you're all in no later than turn 2. 

It needs to be said that once you get past a starter set or the rulebook with an index/codex and a couple boxes of miniatures this game is *expensive*. Maybe the most expensive miniatures wargame there is. The flip side is that it is very popular and there are a lot of game stores with active player groups. A lot of online fora, blogs, & websites to check out as well. Then there's the list building. Anyone who doesn't want to pick their own forces should avoid this game. Anyone who likes diving into their factions forces to pick what's best will dig it. Immersion is possible. I am immersed.

Many of the changes players have wanted for years, and successfully stripped out the bloat of 7th edition while keeping the fun bits.

This is the only true tabletop miniatures skirmish game that I have played, so I don't have a robust frame of reference for this genre. That being said, I am impressed with the fluid, tight design of this ruleset. The accessibility and relatively brief gameplay is remarkable for a system with so many options and moving parts. Simple concepts like unit coherency and morale checks make thematic sense and add rich flavor to the game. I love the faction abilities, psychic powers, and the joy and challenge of creating your army. And of course, moving troops around the table and chucking handfuls of dice is an absolute blast. This seems like a major achievement for Games Workshop and a significant contribution to the hobby.

More streamlined than previous versions. It has the same 40K feeling without the fiddly bits.

By far the best edition ever.  With the new face of the company and the amazing support, this is a winner for the ages!

No so much a game as a complete hobby.  The barrier to entry can still feel high as it takes a while to get enough models for a complete army, but GW has done a lot of good work in making starter kits that lower that overall barrier.

I've not played significantly since 2nd edition, 3rd edition took itself too seriously, then dabbled in 6th edrition at 25th anniversary, but it just don't don't float my boat. However, just like other recent GW releases this is an actual improvement with the new edition.  It has slick gameplay and complements skirmish provided by shadow war (and nice to see space hulk surfacing again for true board game).  Coupled with the indexes it's a great system and I've managed to field armies going right back to rogue trader armies. It's very good... 


Stand by the above initia assessment and early does work wel with the freedom it allows you to build games however you want, taking best bits from 1st and 2nd while allowing you to fi last single units to huge armies wth everything in them. Iâ€™m really kmpress d with this. 

Death guard are my first new army in two decades as well,minis are great!!!

Always looking for more T'au, Ork, Necron, and Ultramarine minis.  Would also consider terrain pieces potentially.

Still have not played this game yet. I bought a starter kit with 2 armies, have not fully assembled them yet.

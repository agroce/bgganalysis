A great game that provides an exciting story to the battle. Though it may not be truly historical, the game brought the tanks from Russian Front to the table in a medium complexity brain burner system.

Game needs more playing to be familiarized with all the units plus-and-minus.

Felt that infantry units are overly defensive....

An oldie but a goodie. After a hiatus of many years (I first bought this when I was a teenager), I've begun playing it again, including at WBC 2015. Still own my original boxed set. It is "gamey" and some of the rules are fiddly, but it's still a pure tank game. Some of the nostalgia has worn off, though, and I've realized there are many wargames I'd rather play.

The first wargame I ever played.  There were easier ones to start learning with, but I didn't know about them. I don't feel it has aged well, however.  There are some rules issues regarding seeing the enemy and allowing them to drive right up to your units unmolested that keep me from wanting to play it anymore. But it will always be remembered fondly.

RATING: 8
It took some time for me to conceptually grasp the size of the units in this game. Now that I have gotten a couple (solo) plays of the regular scenarios under my belt it makes a lot more sense.

The interaction between different types of units (armor, infantry, and artillery) works very well and seems to highly reward a knowledge of proper modern combined arms tactics. The game really is less about shooting the opponent up and more about taking key positions and straight-up outmaneuvering them. You'll also need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of you and your opponent's force composition.

Moving this up to an 8, with potential to go higher in the future. Classic!

Once upon a time, this was the king of all wargames and made Avalon Hill into a successful company.  But the odds based combat tables and the bland board remind me of just how far away from 1970 we are today.  Still, the individual scenarios do require some good tactical decision making and can generate some wargame excitement.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The original game was a classicc, with a lot of detail about the units and tremndous tactical decisions.  But it used dated rules.

So, we didn't ahve command control or opportunity fire back then.  Units would run out into the open from obstructed terrain to other obstructed terrain and be invulnerable, even passing in front of enemy units.

Now, I've heard that grognards have modernized the game -- if they have, this could be a tremendous game.

Somebody out there -- make a modern version of this!! (I'm sure somebody already has).

Extremly dated now but at its time was played and liked a lot. Looking back now all the flaws in the rules were laughable, like the panzerbush syndrome darting from bush to bush and not getting hit. Also charging the guy with 100 trucks, if one truck survived, it could spot for the 50000 artillery pieces behind and you could obliterate every piece going :). Very poor components and artwork too. Should be looked at as the game that spawned tactical wargames.

OK, so this *is* a classic game which many of us have played in our youths, and is pretty simple and playable. But now, some 20  years later, it doesn't have a lot going for it. It has only marginal historicity value, and if you're going to play a challenging, simpler game you're playing euro stuff; and Columbia offers much better wargames in this category. Still, all that said, a simple, quick-playing brigade-level WWII game is still a gaping hole in the wargamer's library, PanzerGrenedier notwithstanding.

My dad introduced me to this game, which introduced me to wargames in general. His was the old version with the pull out sleeve. Unfortunately I gave it away at some point but managed to get a newer copy on eBay in recent times.

Pulled it off the shelf last weekend.. and it's still fun! Sure some of the unrealistic aspects of the mechanics (Panzerbush) can lead to odd tactics but take it for what it is. I generally don't play the boxed Situations, rather pull out a mapboard, some counters and think 'What if...'

This one started it all for me in 1975.  So attractive in a weird sort of way.  I think even then (I was around 10), I could sense it was not much of a simulation.  It covers something that, let's face it, cannot be covered well in a boardgame.  Would far rather play the computer game Combat Mission.  Someday I'll roll this out again, just for the sake of nostalgia.  Never finished a planned re-write of the rules.  In truth the rules are horrible and need a complete re-write.

RATING: 4
It has a host of problems that make it a game only, not a simulation, but even as a game half of the original 12 scenarios are unplayable because they are so unbalanced and another 3 are difficult for one side to play.

To me the biggest thing is that the Soviet infantry companies break the game -- a scenario has to be carefully designed to allow the German player a way to kill them, usually by including sufficient heavy artillery.

After that, possibly the worst issue is that the attack ratings on the infantry units are based on their "anti-tank" ability, which is just absurd.  Also, many of the artillery and assault gun units you would think would have good attack ratings against infantry are instead rated for their ability to attack tanks, making them weak or even useless in their intended role.  Coming up with some dual attack ratings for each of the units (and fixing the town defense rules) would improve the game considerably.

The twelve new scenarios published in the "Wargamer's Guide to Panzerblitz" were much better than the original twelve.  Also the "Boardgamer" magazine and "Boardgamer's Panzerblitz Special Issue" (published by Bruce Monnin), and the excellent counters and new maps created by Ward McBurney, add many additional good scenarios and flavor to the game.

Carefully scenario selection, along with a few house rules (and the MANY official rule clarifications), give this game some play value.  But really there is no reason to look for this antique there have been several decent games on this topic published since then.

This was the first wargame I got in 1982 for Xmas after pestering my parents to buy it. I played this extensively with my father, my friends and anyone who cared to play as a teenager and as an adult, yes this game has been superseeded but with the complexity of many games these days it is virtually beer and pretzel wargaming. I still have the battered box faded worn pieces (still all there)and tattered charts and sticky taped annotated rules. 

I am voting this high as this game is solely responsible for my passion for wargaming and for that it deserves a 9.

An important game for its time, with a nice variety of scenarios and units included in the game.   The basic mechanism of diving Attack by Defense is solid, but where the game suffers is in the amount modifiers.   First, you have to look up weapon and defense armor types on a cross-reference table.   Then you have to look up target elevation on another grid.   Then you have to figure out any terrain modifiers.   Finally you make a simple die roll.   The whole process is just so tedious, and all you really do in this game is shoot and then move units that didn't shoot.  So, yeah, an important game, but a bit of a grind to play.    Has certainly been supplanted by other more modern designs.

This groundbreaking and enduringly playable game is an inflection point of the art. The '10' rating is not a statement of modernity; rather, is the game worth playing and if so how much? The game is every bit as enjoyable as when it smelled like fresh ink, hot oil, and cordite.

It moves along and bookkeeping is slight. You don't have to keep track of loss factors, supply, or command.

Does PanzerBlitz give a flavor for armored tactical combat? After the German has exhausted his scarce infantry and the Russian presses resolutely past a litter of his own burning wrecks, is the proper time to ask.

The bottom line is, it's fun.

Youngsters will not believe how mind-bogglingly imcomprehensible the rules seemed when you first read them in 1972 after years of Stalingrad, Afrika Korps and Battle of the Bulge.  Seems pretty simple now, but it was a shock then.  Still fun, though rules upgrades from Panzer Leader and Arab Israeli wars make for a more believable game.

This is a great game and my first AH game.  More than a classic it has numerous scenarios that increase its playability.  While games have progressed, this has a solid elegance about it that takes into account various factors of tank designs of the time and simplifies those factors into credible and playable mechanics. Played more than listed, but that was before BGG. I am glad to see that its gaming quality is enduring not just for me but for others as well.

I had such high hopes for this game as a middle school or high school student.  The box was really good looking, and the counters, instead of being blue and pink like most Avalon Hill games, were in realistic military colors with silhouettes for the vehicles.  It cost $7, which was a lot for me in those days, but it was going to be worth it.

I was so disappointed when I set it up and read the rules.  One little bush could hide a whole army, and a vehicle could zoom past the entire enemy army without so much as a shot being fired.  I cannot enjoy a tactical game unless it seems at least marginally realistic to me.

Given the reputation as the first truly groundbreaking historical board wargame of WWII armored tactics and its longevity, it seems heretical to criticize this title. I personally prefer PANZER LEADER to this game, although I got this one first and still have very fond memories of it. But were I to play it, I'd want to use the PANZER LEADER rules.  

The box art is perhaps the most compelling ever created for a bookcase style wargame!  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Thank God I'm a freaking math genius. Otherwise, I'd have no idea why I won. It seems to me that either A) overruns are too powerful or B) I read all the rules wrong. I'd lean towards B, but the example in the rules seems to support my read of the instructions. Anyway, I'm not sure this is worth pulling out when I've got so much other awesomeness waiting around in the game closet.

Combate tactico en rusia durante la segunda guerra mundial. Un buen juego, pero con escenarios un poco desequilibrados.

Woah! Very glad to get a chance to play this classic 1970 wargame. The one that started modern wargaming! I bajillion rule look-ups made this 1 1/2 hour game about 4 hours. That was expected. Rules tried their best to add realism to a war simulation. Lots of good ideas and clearly the thought behind this game was leap years ahead of its time. Alas, the game world has had 41 years to improve on this and it most likely has several times over. Still, it was a novel joy to play this!

This was the game that started it all for me.  My first advanced game bought with paper route money.  It was about $7 as I recall and it was bought at a Target-type store way before there was even a Wal-Mart.  Had a very difficult time finding opponents but definitely played more of this than anything else.  Good scale, lots of variation in scenarios, and victory conditions meant you didn't have to wipe out the enemy to win.

Played this back in the day... when Panzerblitz was # 1 game in the (SPI) rankings list.

Interesting bit... my son was in Iraq while the Army was winding down this year (2011). One task was to lead teams checking out the facilities to assure they were clear and nothing significant was left behind. He got back recently and told me that in one unused Iraqi army building he saw a copy of PanzerBlitz. But, it was just the box and beaten up, no components. He has no idea how it got there.

This is the slipcase version that AH did in the early production runs. The game tables (combat, terrain) are printed on the inner lid which allows a stand up table reference.

This is my original copy.

RATING: 3.5
Revolutionary in its day (1970), kind of a merging of the miniatures world and the boardgame.  Having played after some time in tactical miniatures gaming, some of the rules, and situations that came about from the rules, just didn't make sense:  using trucks and carts to block roads -and thereby win a scenario; splitting artillery up against the defending hex, thus more defenders makes arty LESS effective (180 out of reality) come to mind.  But the biggest issue was what the hell does "dispersed" signify?  The other vehicles in an armored platoon can certainly move and return fire; it's more applicable to an infantry platoon, but even then other squads will move/shoot.  I was 13 at the time, and even now some 30 years later-I'm still not sure what Dunnigan was thinking. (For full disclosure I've never been a big fan of his books or games.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A true classic.  This is where "hexagons" where born if you ask me.

It has holes that is for sure (artillery is totally screwed up) and  I wish someone would remake THIS game.  Keep it simple enough to *both* teach and play in < 3 hours and universally generic so we can create scenaios using the boards provided (please do not try to sucker me into an expansion trap, I am way too old to fall for that thank you).  There is just nothing on the market today, nor has there been ever since that can match this IMO.

When I play this old dinosaur I have to use the newer tables and converted values to make it compatible with the updated system used in "The Arab Israeli Wars".  Makes this game a solid 9+ IMHO.

This is one of the most overrated wargames of all time.  Now I love Squad Leader, stuff actually gets destroyed or dies.  But combat results in this were way too abstracted and unfulfilling. It was almost impossible to kill stuff!.

The game's popularity was principally because of the Russian Front craze of the day and the paucity of available games on that subject at the time of its release. It also created a "snob" factor amongst gamers as its adherents liked to imply that they truly understood war and tactics whilst those of us lesser mortals who didn't care for it were dilettantes. This was part of the whole Dunnigan arrogance of the day.

Squad Leader sure cured all of that...

I give this an 8 because it was one of the first wargames I owned and one that radically changed how I looked at games.  Coming from Afrika Korps, Gettysburg, and Battle of the Bulge, the counters in PB blew me away when I bought it when I was 10 years old.  I think many younger gamers cannot grasp the major shift in gaming that PB represented in the mid-70s.  PB paved the way for SL and ASL for me and for that, I thank it.

This was one of the first Avalon Hill board wargames I ever played. The production values are significantly higher than the SPI games of the same era. The maps are board mounted, and the counters are coated and a lot of them are nice, chunky 5/8th inch square. Altogether it made you feel you had got your money's worth and merited the term "bookcase game" as you weren't ashamed to put it in your bookcase.

The rules are relatively easy to understand. The game relies on the classic five factors (attack, range, defence, movement, target type) plus the good old, odds-based Combat Resolution Table.

A good solid game which provided me with many excellent sessions back in the day.

RATING: 6
Perhaps the most paradigm shifting wargame of all time. The first wargame to my memory where the graphics were such a large part of the appeal. Individual tank silouettes on each counter, the fantastic layouts for the scenarios, and well-colored, mounted maps really set the standard for wargames, even today. Also of note are the play-tested and balanced scenarios, which is occasionally missing from today's rush-to-revenue productions. I also really enjoyed the inclusiveness of the tanks represented. However, as a game the hobby has really obsoleted this effort. Panzerblitz is a bit unsophisticated with regard to movement/opportunity fire/activations. Ultimately, Panzerblitz earns its place in the wargames Hall of Fame.

Mother of all tactical tank combat in WW2.  This game is classical and has a great impact in the history of wargames.  It proves that wargames can be popular and can be realistic at the same time.  It can model reality and it gives some sense.  It is a thought provoking game. Looking forward to MMP edition.

A classic in the wargame genre and for all the right reasons. While it does rank as one of the lighter wargames, it still have enough depth to engage the players in the game and provide plenty of tactical choices. Geomorphic map boards and a slew of units greatly increase the replayability of the game. This is a worthwhile game for any wargamers collection.

RATING: 2
A classic, and groundbreaking - in 1970.  Superseded by better designs for at least 25 years (even with Panzer Leader rules refits).  I'm not angry at the game as the rating might suggest, it's just that it has been completely and thoroughly bypassed, and in case someone says "but Panzerbush has been cured" - that's only one of many problems that lead to a completely artificial style of fighting.  By the standards of today I'd almost say PB is a "war themed" game rather than a historical wargame.  I suggest looking for West End's Tank Leader series or Avalanche's Panzer Grenadier instead.

This game is just so iconic. This game is the Beatles of war gaming. It's hard to imagine what gaming was like before it and it's influenced in the genre it created can still be felt.  And as a game it still shines. This game still plays beautifully today. It is a solid and fun game that doesn't get bogged down in fiddy rules.

A copy of this classic can easily be purchased on eBay for a very reasonable price (along with its younger sibling Panzer Leader). I even found a never played unpunched copy.

I am very disappointed with the reboot of this game. If you are looking for a more modern game covering similar scope and size I highly recommend Lock 'N Load's White Star Rising.

Panzerblitz is a wonderful game of armed conflict on the East Front.  It is an old game, but the tactical challenges have aged well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Dunnigan introduced many good ideas in Panzerblitz, but his CRT and unit ratings screwed with the results. (1) The CRT encourages players to search for 'one more factor' to hit 2-1 or especially 4-1 odds. (2) The artillery ratings are inconsistent; one rating scale gives three times the attack factors of the other rating scale (for the mortars, infantry guns, and some field artiillery). (3) The early T-34s are overrated. Even the T-34c should only rate 9-A-5/9-11 or so. Apparently the miniatures version (T-34) in an early S&T corrected this.Shows that tactical games need not be terribly complex. Panzer Leader simplified some rules (stacking) while complicating other rules (airpower, indirect fire, opportunity fire).

I can see why this one is a classic with a devoted following.  It is very accessible, very playable, and fun.  Lots of nice variants, fan sites, and old articles to sift through.  Cool stuff online from old soldier, imaginative strategist, etc. 

That Wargamer's Guide is pretty sweet indeed, as is the Boardgamer's issue. The BPV DYO charts by Byron Henderson are pretty awesome. LEGS.  Can even be retrofitted with some of the PL or AIW rules if that's your style, though it's not really necessary.  It lends itself nicely to customization.

Another nice thing is that there has been 47 years worth of rules clarifications and FAQ, so if you're learning the game, chances are someone has already ironed out an answer to your question.  

There are modern platoon scale games that have supplanted PB for many people, but the rules simplicity and capabilities of the original game should not be underestimated.  Not to mention I find it more aesthetically pleasing than many modern designs.

Bottom line: It's cheap, simple and fun.

One of the first war games that I played as a kid (Midway was the first).

 Second Generation AH (Avalon Hill) game and the first of the new very sharp looking  bookcase designs. 
 Just that cover had you wanting to buy it. 
The cover design was copied to this day on the highly regarded other Eastfront wargame "Case Blue".
  While very popular with my friends who liked "Heavy Metal", Panzerblitz never really caught on with me. 
 A Questionable CRT (Combat Results Table), too much going on in the way of one player's turn 
(Opportunity Fire, Defensive Fire, Movement after fire, Ect)
 Left me indifferent to the game. Plays really slowly.
Not my cup of tea. 
 I liked the graphics, and varied pieces including the Russian stuff and the rare 
(for that era of boardgames) Eastfront Scenarios. 
  "Panzerblitz" came out in 1970 riding on the success
of the 1970 War Film "Kelly's Heroes" and its final battle scenes involving close quarter 
fighting against very impressive looking German Tiger Tanks .

A great wargame. The simplest pure wargame in the bookcase series. The technical manual on the various vehicles is alone worth the price of the game.

Somewhat fiddly with certain rules, like elevation and so on, but basically a really good design in its time, one which others have offered variations for. 

I was somewhat put off by the typically overly formal A-H war game rules. I almost always find I have to rewrite them, and in this case I boiled them down to fit on 2 pages, in 11-pt. Arial Narrow type. 

At the time "Panzerblitz" came out the designer, Jim Dunnigan, was trying to do some different things from some other war games of the time, so in that sense, in terms of its design and time frame, it's rather a classic. 

Acquired in trade, June 2008.

My six rating is based upon my current view of the game.  It's not a young 'un anymore, and it doesn't work well using just the rules as written.  However, in my youth, it was a 10++++.  Also, I think that it gradually improved with PL and especially AIW, and that there is a neat game here when its brought up to the AIW rules standards.  That's the goal of my Allied-Axis Wars variant which can be found on the BGG PB page.

I'm only commenting on the basic original game rules and scenarios.  Hard for me to get into.  Many of the scenarios are extremely unbalanced.  The noted lack of opportunity fire is frustrating.

So it's dated and so it's prone to unrealistic tactics and so it's scenarios are unbalanced; this is a terrific game of tactical armor warfare. Squad Leader is better in almost every way but also so much harder to learn.  Components are far superior to what SPI was delivering and all the 'upgrades' that SPI attempted never made for better games.  Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader are the games to use to bring worthy wargamers into the WW II tactical arena.

Brilliant game, that set the stage for tactical wargaming. Most other games are reactions to this singular game. They seek to correct its perceived flaws, or to expand it in one way or another.
It does have some flaws. The line of sight rules are atrocious. The tables of organization and equipment are flawed. Its own counter mix makes any claim of offering a unit mix for 1941 dubious.
The strengths? Leaves out opportunity fire as a mechanic entirely. If you want to avoid units creeping over open space going from cover to cover, then maintain some units in said cover. It also helps to realize that in a 250 meter sized hex, there would be micro-terrain which would also offer cover even in open spaces. Variety, a vast number of scenarios are available. Add on counters are somewhat expensive, but give you the ability to expand what is in the box. And unlike most current tactical games, you can be good to go with one box! No more tackle boxes, just a single box you can tuck under your arm.
Look into the various rules sets, and decide for yourself what options you want to use. This game is available, inexpensive, has a short playing time, and is easy to store. It doesn't get much better than this!

A vintage classic. A best seller when it was released. Today it is a bit obsolete. Easy rules (just one sheet) and fast deployment. It is a precedent of all the Squad Leader System. A must have for any Wargamer enthusiast.

Jim Dunnigan, George Bradford, Alan Arvold ... contributors to this outstanding board game and war strategy covering the Eastern Front in 1943-45.   This is a great board game of armored warfare during World War II.  It's a timeless classic.

RATING: 6
A wonderful game but dated.  Some of the scenarios are not in the least balanced; if a fight seems unfair, it is.  Feel free to adjust victory conditions or remove a couple counters from the force that is too strong.
Another problem was the PanzerBrush strategy where tanks would skuttle like cockroaches from one bit of cover to the next.  Not a problem for us since we used the Panzer Leader rules once that game came out.
Having said that, I had a lot of fun with this game.  I would have rated the game as a 7 back then, now it is less.

For an old hex and counter game this is one of the easier ones to learn. Suffers badly from you go, I got syndrome. You just dash your units from cover to cover and you enemy cannot do anything. 
Still fun game with light rules for the era.

RATING: 7
A very good clean system which has outlasted most of its numerous imitators. Not nearly as unhistorical as widely thought (even the dreaded Panzerbush Syndrome can be defended) & to me the platoon/company scale is probably the smallest at which battles still have some resonance to reality (as opposed to seemingly random collections of squads & individual vehicles). Anyway, this one is all good clean fun, although I prefer Panzer Leader.

RATING: 4
I still play and enjoy Panzerleader and AIW, but Panzerblitz is just too unrefined.  That game needed some additional play testing.  It is shocking for such a widely distributed and old game how many areas have people playing it differently.  The Russian companies just destroy the feel of the game.  Instead of burning men the Russian infantry are indestructible rocks.

PanzerBlitz, armored combat on the Eastern Front during WWII, at the platoon and company level. Designed by James Dunnigan and sold to rival Avalon Hill in order to gain operating capital for SPI. The game was like no other at the time (which wasn't too unusual because there weren't really all that many games in print); the counters were larger, 5/8", and had more information on them than was usual, including a silhouette graphic of the vehicular units. The innovative geomorphic map sections, which could be laid out side by side or end to end, in any order including upside down, were introduced in this game. The game came with a set of 12 scenario cards, and also provided guidelines on how to design your own 'Situation 13' scenarios. I own at least 10 copies of the game, along with all manner of variant kits, and PNP third-party maps and counters. I've devised house rules, and adapted concepts from similar games, to keep the game up to date. I've designed campaigns and solo rules to feed my addiction. There's a campaign set up on my game table right now. The games get 7s because they are dated, and this is what I would rate them for other players if asked, but they're both closer to 9s to me - nothings perfect.

First tactical wargame I ever played. Quite dated by today's standard, but I think that any player's journey into tactical wargames should begin with the game that created the genre and set the standards by which all games are measured now. 

Additionally, the rules are very simple and straightforward, making it very attractive for beginners.

Its I-go-you-go mechanism has a chess-like feeling that I love, and that requires you to think lots of moves ahead. Great for tactical thinking!

Its flaws (panzerbush syndrom, lack of opportunity fire, scenario imbalances) have been overstated, although some reburbishing can be made by using some optional rules available in the BGG.

RATING: 7
A remarkably innovative game which was plagued by two problems. First, the IGO-UGO turn sequence allowed "Panzerbush" tactics wherein moving units could rush across open terrain and then park behind obstructions in order to avoid defensive fire. Second, reliance on traditional "defense factor" measures and odds-based combat, which leads to "all or nothing" results rather than the attritional type of damage suffered by units when in contact with the enemy.

The first problem is largely fixed by using the opportunity fire rules from the Panzer Leader sequel. The second was never addressed.

I have played this game for the first time in 2015, so my rating cannot be blamed to base on nostalgia.

Agreed, this game has some weaknesses which mainly have to be contributed to the playability (e.g. very simple hiding and spotting rules). But overall, this is a very good Simulation of combined arms and an excellent playable game. It's plain amazing that something like this was already available in 1971.

When this game was first issued in 1970 it changed the landscape of the gaming fraternity. The concept of taking different units with different capabilities and using them like a team to achieve an objective was a great idea. 
When I first saw the rules, I thought I would never get through them, but over time this became second nature. 
The original 1970 edition had heavy black and red backed pieces. Later editions had only a lighter black and white backing.
The game came to life again after the General article "The Pieces of Panzerblitz" (perhaps the best wargame article ever) came out and people re-opened the box. Many reported that they were not playing it right and that the article helped them to finally realize the pros and cons of each piece and how they should be used in the course of play. A real boon to the game!

Of great historical interest, and probably still good if you're into the classic hex-and-counter wargames.  Rules are overly verbose and hard to read, but game system is relatively clean.  A lot of number crunching and trying to get your forces to that golden odds ratio to take out a few of the opponents troops.  Games (even so-called "classic hex-and-counter tactical wargames") have come a long way in terms of playability since this.

I owned this game while my buddy owned Panzer Leader, we would play one or the other, but, then we would play we components from both games. We had a considerable amount of fun playing the all nighters on the floor. I think both of us are too old to play on the floor nowadays, I still think of those games with fondness though. I gave my PanzerBlitz to my friend when I started my mid 1990s purge. I've recently made contact with this old friend, I wonder if he still has both games...

I noticed I had not left any comments on PanzerBlitz, so I am making up for that injustice.  What can I say that so many others have not said already? Not too much. What I will echo of others comments: If you think this game is dated and more modern games outshine it- guess again.  This game, while it has many original flaws, can be backfitted with newer rules- opportunity fire, unit morale, better Combat Results Tables and Weapons Effectiveness Charts.  All you have to do is look for them in the files section of PanzerBlitz or even Panzer Leader on BGG.  Is this a classic? Most definitely. Will it play more realistically with updated rules and some revised counters? Absolutely.

Chalk this score up to 'fond memories as a kid'.  We didn't play with a LOT of the more advanced rules, basically just move-and-shoot, but it seemed to work okay.

Compare this to AP's "Panzer Grenadier" system, and it just comes up short in every catagory.  It was fun for a while, but there are simply better games out now that cover the exact same topics with higher quality.

This is another of Avalon Hills all time classics. It's sort of squad leader one step up the organizational chart. Platoons instead of squads.
Geomorphic maps that can be rearranged to create different terrain. Ranged fire. Line of sight.
But this was more about tanks than your average foot soldier. 
It was a big favorite in our game club. And most of the members owned one (or more). Like Squad Leader, a lot of players made bigger games by adding more maps and more counters.
Many years ago I traded mine for a new generator for my Harley. Sometimes I wish I hadn't. But that generator cost a lot more than that game.

An epic wargame with tanks in the eastern front during the WWII.

Innovative in it's day. You can see the influence of this game in games made to this day. Open to play a modifies version over Vassal/Skype.

Maybe I am jaded, but this game doesn't seem to have aged well in the face of newer tank games.  Perhaps it's the lack of opportunity fire?

Somewhat dated, but still lots of fun.

A classic yes, but as a game falls short. Terribly gamey and unrealistic. Much more generic feeling than say SL/ASL. But boy, the cover is so iconic!

I'd have to say this is the game that got its hooks in me and made me into a gamer.

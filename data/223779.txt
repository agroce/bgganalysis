A game of moving colonists from Earth to Mars in a two step process.  This is achieved by playing cards, either from a hand of two or from two other cards in your preparation zone.  Each card has different from hand and prepped actions.  Colonists arriving on Mars are allocated to one of four buildings, triggering that building's special ability.  If that sounds interesting, well it isn't.  The best card to play is always obvious.  Your success is dependent on drawing better cards than your opponents.  Good luck.

Production quality is fine and the artwork is OK.

First play: All over in 30 minutes so no harm done but really a pretty random experience that I wouldn't want to repeat. High number cards will let you place settlers on the buildings and low ones won't. That seems to be the factor that determines first place.

Didn't enjoy this game after one play, so difficult to make a full assessment of the game. Just wasn't my cup of tea at all, sat on the shelf unplayed for a few months before trading for something else.

RATING: 5
Interesting mechanic of the double usage of the cards, not enough developed. Luck in the draw is too high and with a single action in your turn it is difficult to plan a "combo" of your cards, especially when playing in more than 2.

This is indeed a sturdy, replayable, strategic and short medium to heavy weight filler. I'm extremely pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a more 'cerebral' way to pass a spare 30 or less minutes. I'll be getting quite some play out of this in the future.

2017-12-18 : First play. I initially thought this was going to be another little engine building game but it turns out it's a "spot the best combo given these 4 cards and the board situation" game. And you either get good combos or you don't. As a filler it's an ok game, but nothing special.

[b]Comments:[/b]

Quite puzzly little game that's portable and quick to set up but you can get quite absorbed by your own little puzzle to take note of possibilities for interaction which is a shame.

[b]Why I got rid of it:[/b]

I suspected when I started playing this game that longevity would be a problem and indeed it was. My motivation to get this game to the table dropped off quickly. It tried to incorporate multi-use cards, a mechanic I normally really like, but they just weren't interesting enough and games started to feel very samey after a while.

What a tiny neat game! The core premise is you want to bring all your colonists from Earth to buildings on Mars, using your spaceship - and cards, of course!
The game uses multi-use cards which have an effect when you play them from your hand and another when you play them from your prep module (tableau). The thing is, you can also play a card from an opponent's prep module. They still get the ability on the card but you get the additional effects. This can lead to situations where you place cards on your prep module, waiting for them to be stolen.
If you think colonizing Mars is a peaceful endeavor, think again! The card effects and  player interactions can get quite nasty.
The box is already very portable, but it can be even more if you leave it behind.
The play sessions are very quick, so it should fit lunch breaks very well.

Don't get fooled by the name & box size - this is a solid fully fledged area control & hand management game with a neat sci-fi theme; minimal component-wise, very tactical gameplay-wise, clever design-wise, very good overall. You will be impresed how much game you get out of that little box!

The blurb on the back of the box claims that this game is "fast paced and wildly dynamic....a heavy weight filler". But it is little more than an attempt to cash in on the fashion for Mars-themed games. Apart from the art on the box cover and cards there is nothing here to relate the game to colonising Mars. Names on the cards and meeples rather than cubes would at least have given an indication of some effort to paste on the theme. Moving Cubes with Coloured Cards would be a more apt title for this clunky and dull game. It fails to be anything it claims to be: it is not fast-paced, not at all dynamic in the usual meaning of the word, and is certainly not heavy weight. I suppose it is a filler in the sense that it can fill a 20 minute gap in your exciting life with a relaxing dose of boredom as you...slowly push your 7 cubes from one card to another.

The game rewards planning several turns in advance, has some interesting new mechanics and plenty of choices. It's a little luck dependent, even with drafting, and there are no real strategic options. Satisfyingly thinky filler, nonetheless.

This game surprised me on the upside, providing more interesting decisions than I was expecting on just reading the rules, and much of it is to do with the card interplay. You're racing to move your cubes from Earth to your spaceship, and then from your spaceship to various buildings on Mars so as to gain VPs. This can be done using generic actions, or faster through card effects. Cards have a top effect which can be used from hand, and a bottom effect which can be used when you play it from your tableau against a building (which also provides the main means of getting your colonists onto buildings, other than directly through effects). Much of your game is spent trying to work out the best way to use the cards you draw, and consequently which of the multiple scoring avenues you wish to pursue. In a nice get-out, the game also provides the option of using another player's card against a building, giving them the card effect, but you get the colonist (maybe) and the building's effect. The action and effect variety means the game packs a pretty fair punch for its weight, which comes in neatly around the 30 minute mark, and the game does some interesting things in its mechanics and effect interactions, including referencing both the front and the backs of the cards. There seems to be a decent amount of luck involved in how much the cards you draw will help or not, especially as the game is shortish, and its nature will tend to have the VPs relatively clustered. But the luck feels acceptable for its weight, and I enjoyed the constant decision making on what cards to keep in hand and what to place in my tableau for their respective effects. I'll be happy to pull this out again in future.
(Disclaimer: I received a copy for helping Englishfy the rules, but wasn't involved with the final edit, nor with the card effects.)

Still unsure on this game. I want to like it more. Can't decide whether it isn't very deep, or if I just haven't discovered it's complexity yet. At the moment it seems like decisions aren't particularly important/interesting but this might change as I play it more and learn more about it.

Bought this because it was cheap and has clean graphic design. The game has modestly intriguing interaction of mechanisms, almost entirely abstract with only the barest effort to link the actions to the theme. I think it'd be mildly more appealing if the "projects" had some kind of title at least, to afford a little illusion that the game is about building a colony on Mars - but the real test is whether it is a game worth playing. After an initial test 2p game, I am moderately optimistic that the gameplay had a bit more bite than too often is the case with micro games. If not, I don't regret the purchase, and will continue to be interested in trying out whatever this publisher brings out next.

tl;dr: nice little game

This game is by no means a big strategic game, but it certainly is bigger than the box would lead you to believe. It features an interesting mechanism where you have to choose to play either one of your 2 cards in your hand and perform the action, or one of the cards in your prep module (face down on the table) to perform up to 3 actions. Or, and this is pretty cool, if you don't have the colors you want, you could opt to play one of the cards in other players prep module. They still get to do one of the actions, but you're certain you'll be able to do the action of the location where the card is played. This game still has a significant amount of luck, but this mechanism helps mitigate that a bit without hurting the other players too much. After all, they still get to do the action on the card in question.
All in all this works really well in a reasonable amount of play time. Cool stuff!

A nice little game that has as much going on during its short playtime as many much larger games. I can't agree with the comments that the game is dull clunky and that it's not fast-paced: it's very engaging, with just the right number of player actions, and cards that can be used in two different ways, resulting in some interesting choices during play. Game-end is reached pretty quickly, so you can't hang around. I think this might be part of the 'problem' that many small or micro games face: they don't allow players to fart around crafting the perfect strategy and this is exactly what a lot of players want.

My only criticsm of the game is that the text and icons on the cards are way too small.

Another fabulous looking production from DoW but everything from them except TTR has left me a little disappointed and it is a bit shallow. Only the traitor element makes it interesting. The rest of the gameplay is a bit slow and repetitive and doesn't give you the feeling that you have too much control over events. Update - Battlestar Galactica has made this obsolete

I do have to be in the mood for this, but usually enjoy it when it makes it to the table. Games that wind up with no traitor usually fall flat - it's a bit on the easy side for us. Thinking of getting the expansion to spice it up a bit. Always seems to feel longer than it actually is - not sure if that's a plus or a minus!

I dunno.  This one to me seemed like it was really just a bunch of mini-games pasted together.  There is some strategy for the teamwork aspects, based on which knights are in the pool.  The theme is fairly well expressed, but overall I wasn't satisfied with the combination of gamelength and involvement and fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great co-operative game (who knew there was such a thing?) with a twist (the Traitor), and although the gameplay mechanics are relatively simplistic, this is not a simple game.  Great theme, visuals, components, and concepts, and this is a game with a ton of opportunities for quality expansions.  Definitely a must-have, especially considering it plays 3-7 players.

Own the [boardgame=35704]Merlin's Company[/boardgame] expansion.

I'm totally a fan of the coop game, but the non-linear "mini-game" nature of this game just removes any tension. I suppose with a dash of role-playing this would be more fun, but otherwise the whole enterprise seems pointless.

A beautifully looking game for sure!!! This one is unique amonge the coops.
A slow paste game, however it has its magic and the decisions are on the soft side (always room for the traitor to manover in) It deserves its popularity.

Great memories of this one with Chris as traitor!  Got for Christmas 2007--Thanks mom!

While certainly an enjoyable, casual game, I think the cooperative with traitor element has been done better in a game like Battlestar Galactica.  

Also, it's frustrating that some players spend most of the game just throwing away cards.

151117 I actually quite like the bioterrorist version of Pandemic.  So screw it, no interest in Shadows.

120909 In contrast to scotland yard this is an absolute clusterfuck.  I can see why people like it, but it felt like a very methodical exercise in building up hands while running around squashing problems ala Pandemic but with a traitor element.  I'd rather play Scotland Yard, Panic Station, or Pandemic over this any day.

[I]tl;dr: It's hard to beat Shadows in the co-op realm. It provides more gameplay and decisions than simpler co-ops, without being too difficult to beat. The traitor mechanic makes every game fresh and keeps you doubting your friends.[/I]

Shadows over Camelot is the best co-op game out there, with the possible exception of Escape: Curse of the Temple. You all play the role of knights of Arthur's round table, tasked with protecting Camelot from the forces of evil. Only catch? One of you may be a traitor!

Using cards, quests, teamwork, and planning, you must get white swords on the round table and defeat evil (which is trying to put black swords on the table). Each turn you will progress evil by drawing a black card, adding a siege engine, or losing a life point. Then, you will be able to take a heroic action to try to complete a quest. 

Shadows is a very popular game that has never been a miss when we've brought it out. Though there are a lot of rules to go over, it's been a hit even with non-gamers (a few have gotten overwhelmed). Because it's a coop, there's a lot of ways to help different players -- the presence of a hidden traitor makes everything even more fun! 

This is a great alternative to Dead of Winter and thematically is right up my alley. Though the theme isn't super rich, the board game graphics are immersive and everything makes sense within the theme. Some of the quest items you will recover are Excalibur, the Holy Grail, and Lancelot's Armor, and the knights each have special abilities to help them win quests. 

A few wrinkles to what is otherwise a 10-rated game for me: first of all, with new players the game can go long. Though it accommodates 7, be prepared for that to take a couple hours -- I prefer things with four or five. Secondly, if one player decides not to cooperate, it can ruin the game for everyone (has happened to me, which soured me on the game for a while) -- but then, that's inherent to all co-op games.

Overall, Shadows over Camelot is one of my favorite co-ops, and a game that we have gotten our money's worth from.

Pretty cool co-op game. The traitor aspect is way cool and totally changes the feel of the game (adding a good deal of tension).

The game mechanics sometime feel a bit too simple, though, and the game can feel repetitive.

Heavily weighted towards the traitor, but a great game for building tension and team dynamics. The collective groan that emerges when evil demands that all knights abandon theior quests and return to Camelot is proof the game works.

I was a little disappointed by this game, because it is only a fancier cardgame (like the cooperative Lord of the Rings) and not as intersting as Battlestar Galactica. As the traitor I had no chance, to really disturb the Heroes and after I revealed myself, I had almost nothing to do anymore and just observed how the game won against the heroes in my favor. I think all aspects of the game are much better redone in Battlestar Galactica.

One of my group's favorite games! We have only ever played it with the Merlin's Company expansion, so I can't very well rate the base game alone. But I can say it wasn't easy to win before, and it certainly hasn't been easy to win after adding the expansion. Sometimes, the game just mercilessly hates on us, and we have no chance of winning.

However, we have beaten the game twice and unfortunately the accomplishment felt like it had lost some of its flavor the second time. It wasn't easy, and we had to earn it, but it did feel like, "been there done that."

RATING: 6
Rating based on one play. I was the traitor, and it's a boring role to play in this game.  The other characters get to fulfill quests and do some trading, which is more exciting. There's no incentive to even pretend you're good. You're essentially best off actively playing against the other players from the very beginning, and then continuing as a traitor when you've gotten far enough. It's still a fun game and I enjoyed myself, but I can't imagine choosing to play this game over my other co-ops (Dead of Winter, Pandemic, etc.).

No, it's fine. It's just that after we finally beat the board - I'm not thrilled about the game anymore (it's trivial to beat the board with 6-7 players, seems impossible with 3). But a few in the game group still love it. It also scales well and is gateway in complexity. So we'll be playing again.

RATING: 7
Definitely one of the most enjoyable co-ops. Most of the bad qualities of a typical cooperative boardgame are absent here. By this I mean that all players have their own will and most importantly can act on it. There is no one mastermind pulling holding all the strings in hand just basically everyone what they should do. This is achieved through with one simple rule. You are not allowed to explicitly discuss the contents of your hand cards. I also enjoyed how tension quickly began to build up on multiple fronts creating a feeling of desperation. This also leaves room for the Traitor to do some subtle moves. The DoW version of the game has a very good production value, too.
 
What I didn’t like however, was that moving your figure on the board counted as an action. Sure, it balances the game, but that makes it more of a design issue. Spending your turn just to move is very unsatisfying. To fix this, the game balance would need to be shifted. I am also a bit unsure about the player elimination. It is not only bad choices that can lead to your peril but bad luck plays a role also. Hence, I think player elimination is a bit too brutal. A major punishment would be a better choice if only everyone can keep playing.

I absolutely love playing this game. I enjoy cooperative games in general – but here it is the wonderful theme that gets me. I love the Arthurian myths. I have never lost a game of this - either playing as a knight or as a traitor. Granted, the traitor once revealed is extremely powerful (mwa-ha-ha) but was so much fun to play. They totally suspected it was me, and rightly so, but by revealing me I became so much more powerful. 

Even when we play without the traitor mechanic the game is great (and we mostly play without the traitor... which could be my fault, I make a very good – or is it bad – traitor.) My favorite knight in game is Sir Palamedes – because I'm the type of person to sacrifice a life for the team - he fits perfectly with my style of play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First play through and it was very enjoyable.  The theme was great and the production quality was very good!  The traitor mechanic is definitely exciting.  Despite all the fun I had playing it, there were a couple of frustrating aspects:

1) It felt difficult to get white cards for me.  Seems like I was always struggling to get white cards.
2) #1 was exacerbated by the fact that in order to get more I had to travel back to Camelot and in doing so face a potentially disastrous "Travel Card" (Merlin's expansion).

I think these frustrations were aided by the fact that:

1) I had picked to do the Grail quest solo - meaning that I wasn't getting cards from completing quests because the grail quest is a long one.
2) The traitor was actively working against me completing the grail quest - unbeknownst to me until the end.

Definitely looking to add this to my collection.

This is a very good co-op game to play with most of my friends.  We join to beat the game but not compete with each other.  Very elegant game pieces, acceptable game length, easy to learn and high re-playability!!  Moreover, the traitor element does make it tense and more fun!  Being a traitor, one must role very carefully not to disclose his 'real' purpose.  Being loyalty, one must be alert always when dealing with other knights!  Like another game at the same time!!!

I was really excited about getting this game! My friends and I had never played before. We picked the characters that looked the most interesting, started into the game, and it went absolutely horrible. We could not win no matter how hard we tried. Apparently, we had picked one of the few character combinations that it is literally impossible to win with. There are blogs and forum posts about it (we found this out afterwards). Unfortunately, since that was our first time playing, and it went so poorly, it really turned us off from playing again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent co-op game with the traitor element. I generally don't like games that come down to player politics or dice rolls (settlers of catan) but this one gets it right by making the politicing about finding out the traitor. Much of the fun comes from all the accusing around the table!

We find 2 traitors too much though and limit it to 1 or 0.

The fact it can accomodate 7-8 players is awesome too

+ The pressure from the game, along with the threat of a traitor, makes for a very tense battle of tug-of-war.
- A bit long on playtime for what the game is.


Why it's previously-owned:
When I think of playing this game, I only think of the boring card management piece.  If we want a game about traitors or backstabbing or paranoia, we have better selections for those.
I gave this away to my friend to build his own awesome collection of real games.

I really enjoyed Shadows and want to play more (but cult of the new keeps getting in the way!). I love the use of poker hand style mechanisms. The only pity is that it can be hard for saboteurs to do so secretly (we tend to have to tell the table what options are there for new players) and it can feel restrictive (with movement taking a whole turn). Other games are more elegant but this earns its place as a good quality semi co-op.

RATING: 5
I love the theme but the game drags a lot, with players often doing little to nothing during their turn. Being a co-op doesn't help matters—that style of game just isn't my jam. The cool traitor mechanic helps mitigate that a bit, but not enough to bump it up to a 7 rating.

RATING: 6
I haven't played this enough to have a proper reaction, but my first play through was rough. I played Battlestar Galactica first, years ago, and had high hopes for this co-op game, expecting the theme to be more broadly relatable, the mechanics easier to pick up and the play time of sixty minutes to be more palatable to my new gaming group. And generally, that was true. You're essentially hopping around a giant board trying to create or place poker hands-- three of a kind and a pair, two pairs, a straight, etc.-- with the game's cards. However, every player's turn is also a turn for the evil, and the luck of the draw can be occasionally devastating, but more often than not it's just a frustrating game of tug-of-war where evil always has a leg up because the knights just do things too dang slow. 

If you want to move to a quest, that's your one action. Meanwhile, evil gets to set one of your quests back by a card. You want to contribute to the poker hand? You can only play ONE card, and that's one action. Evil may then immediately counteract you or play another card elsewhere. Where this ends up going feels like an inevitable snowball in evil's favor, and that's before you even mix in a traitor. Until I learn the tricks to it, or general strategies, the game is just too slow and tilted toward evil winning to be appealing or exciting. Sure, if we squeaked out a win in these poor odds, we'd feel really excited, but I don't see that happening often. That's a shame. 

We're going to try our next round with house-ruling every player taking TWO actions per turn, or at least not counting moving to a location as an action. That may snowball towards the good side, but as it stands, the game feels unbalanced already. Not recommended at this time.

Overall good game - especially with the right group that gets in the spirit of things.  Traitor is a huge plus, although I could see playing without it if you were playing with kids.  Only downside is the possible endgame where you want to lose a quest to get more black swords.  If you still have more white swords, however, you win.  This can be easily fixed by variants suggested on this website.  Components are beautiful and game is just plain fun - definitely not a brain burner.

It is definitely a good game. However, compared to the Lord of the Rings, it somehow feels more "mechanical" for me. It lacks the suspense and constantly mounting tension of the LotR where you often barely survive but still have the chance.

In Shadows over Camelot, players becomes subjects of King Arthur who tries to win enough quests to win the game.  Each character has their special abilities and players have to collaborate to win the game.

In the game, there are many quests which the heroes are able to take part in.  Some quests are continuous quests which after the completion of the quest will restart the quest all over again.  Some quests are 1 time quests which the quest will usually be awarded with some artifacts which will help players in the game.

Though most players are your friends in the game, 1 of the players may be the traitor in the game who is out to sabotage other players.  Players can call accused each other as the traitor but penalty would be given if accusations were made to the wrong person.  Win enough quests to win the whole game which the traitor will really try hard to prevent it.

Good points: An interesting game which players collaborate to win the game together.  There are many quests in the game, which players are able to select the most appropriate quest (depending on the hands of the player) to complete.  Flipping over the dark cards (one of the bad actions) can be exciting towards the later part of the game when players prayed hard not to encounter certain cards.

Bad points: It is really hard to win this game.  After playing for quite a lot of times, we can only win the game once.  My friends and I kept playing the game while we lost, but after we won the game once, we are so tired that we never played the game anymore.

Shadows over Camelot is a game similar to Pandemic which players collaborate to acheive the winning objective of the game with a slight difference.  It is similar because players have to do a bad action then followed by a good action.  The bad action will prevent players from winning, but the good action will help players win the game.  The difference being that there may be a traitor amongst all the heroes.  It adds uncertainty to the game and follows more or less the storyline of King Arthur which makes the game more interesting.

Fun game but we played without a traitor which ruined the game a bit. I wasn't the one reading the rules and perhaps it's possible to play without a traitor but I feel you should house rule it so there is always someone ruining your missions. That's a very big part of the game I think.

Evil game of co-operative crisis management with the added factor of a secret "traitor" in your midst.

Popular with my friends and family it has shot to the top of my most played list and will remain for the near future at least

Difficult enough to be challenging and interesting, but not so difficult that it's frustrating and makes you want to give-up or quit.
Co-operative, but the players can split up and perform different tasks so that each feels useful and contributing.
Option for a traitor makes things super interesting, werewolf style.
I'm a big fan.

RATING: 7
Much more of an 'experience' game rather than a game that you play in a competitive fashion. An enjoyable game but not something with much staying power in my mind. The only interesting part is that there might be a traitor present. Otherwise you're just playing cards without much thought. The decisions are fairly obvious for the most part. If you are looking for a coop game with the possibility of a traitor then Battlestar Galactica is a better choice.

A fun game, but feels impossible as you play! It takes so long to do anything and the evil spreads really quickly (especially with more players!) and you feel like there's nothing you can do to stop it!

This game is gorgeous to look at and a lot of fun to play, especially because of the whole "are you the traitor?" aspect to it. 

The game is challenging if the knights don't work together closely but not so punishing that you never win. Many of our games have come down to the wire with the outcome of a particular quest being crucial for a win or loss.

Days of Wonder has produced a fantastic game - I only wish they had released more expansions, possibly with more quests that you could decide to swap in or out as you choose.

Perhaps still the best implementation of cooperative play.  By limiting communication it eliminates the puzzle-like feel that full knowledge brings to other designs.  The traitor adds terrifically to the game, although he is quite constrained in what he may do.  Very well themed too.  Concerns about play balance with the range of players and with and without the traitor take my rating down a notch.

The end game is very weird in this game.  Three of the four games I have played, the good guys win by fighting off seige engines while waiting for the dragon to burn down Camelot to get us to 12 total swords.  The other game, we won by actually killing the dragon in a huge mob.

The game where we killed the dragon highlighted another serious problem with the game, which is that it is hard for the traitor to do anything negative without obviously being the traitor.  It turned out the idea to kill the dragon came from the traitor, which leads to the funny mental image of the traitor suggesting all his friends go kill the dragon and then being shocked when they come back alive.  However, it seems that the only thing the traitor can do which doesn't immediately expose themselves as the traitor is to make bad suggestions.  At all other times there is an optimal decision and any deviation immediately exposes the traitor.

A solid 7 after one play.  Although I'd like to rate it higher, the fact that we ran through EVERY card in the white deck during a game left me feeling that the game would not hold a lot of "suprises" with extensive play.  That being said, this is a very enjoyable co-op game and it was very tense since the players had to practically flirt with death most of the game to keep the quests moving in the right direction.  Too bad you need at least 3 to play.  Still a 7 after a second play.

If you have a large group and you want to band together this is the game for you. I have played this game with 3 and with 7 and it comes alive when you have a larger group. Very fun and can be tense. Good for people that want to spend time with friends and communicate without the competitive element of most board games. There is also a traitor element in the game that adds a whole new element in that you don't know who is a friend and who is actually against you.

The game has very special atmosphere. I have lowered this from 9, because I'm starting to feel that the traitor wins every game with less than 5 players.

I have to try this with 6 players a few times.

RATING: 7
A good game all around. The cooperations in this co-op game is brilliant as well as incorporating the traitor element into that cooperation. Each turn you "advance evil" before taking your turn. And there really isn't any action you can take there that isn't going to make you look the traitor. And probably the most brilliant and devious aspect is that there might not even be  traitor. 
Sadly we rarely get a chance to play with more than just the 2 of us or maybe 1 or 2 more. So it's a game that won't see much play time so it's hitting the trade list. But if you get together regularly with 4+ people don't miss this classic in the genre.

{3 plays, 7, 4 & 2! player} First game (7 players) was fun, despite it's 3+ hours length in which MUCH of that time was spent spinning our wheels.  What was more fun, though, was the 1+ hour discussion of the game afterward in which we maybe decided that the game wasn't worth it, despite it being GORGEOUS.  Played it two more times (4 player, 2 player!) and it was already feeling a bit samey to me.  Much more thematic for me, however, than LotR, but just not nearly as good.

Although I have played SoC several times, it has been with the same three people and without a traitor.

Basically a set/trick collection game with a medieval theme attached to it. Not fully cooperative as one player can secretly be the traitor who is trying to foil the knight's plans.

Nachdem ich so viele gute Reviews gelesen und angeschaut habe (besonders das von Tom Vasel) habe ich mir das Spiel gekauft. Die deutsche Version ist Anfang 2013 so gut wie vergriffen, von daher habe ich die Gelegenheit genutzt als es als Neu angeboten wurde.
Das Spielmaterial sieht sehr gut aus. Die Spielpläne, Karten und Figuren laden wirklich zum Spielen ein.
Das Spiel ist ein Koop-Spiel für mindestens 3 Spieler (mit der Verrätervariante sollten es wohl besser ein paar Spieler mehr sein).
Ich werde das Spiel wohl hauptsächlich solitair spielen.

The theme and artwork take this game a long way, and the mechanic of poker-style hands to match up with quests is really clever and makes the game very accessible, but I don't like the pacing (too often a player sits in the same place and drops a card for multiple turns at a stretch), the downtime, or the weirdness where the players have an incentive to run out the clock by intentionally failing quests if they've got an ironclad white-sword majority.

If you have never played a cooperative game, this one makes for a good introduction, especially so for those wanting to play with family that includes children and/or non-gamers. Many will find this a fine family game. However, once you branch out to more sophisticated co-op games (Battlestar Galactica being my favorite), you will find this game exposed and lacking.

This game is fun I guess, but man, an evil Lancelot? That... that's hard for me to take man. See, I read this 'Once and Future King' book back in highschool, and it was dreaaaaaadful.

There was a threesome there somewhere.

I have now played with five people and it is a really fun game with a few more adding to the dynamic. Trying to work out who the traitor is is great fun although it can be a little too easy to work out with certain players who cannot hide their emotions.

Played now with six and I have got to be the traitor (game 12 and 13 respectively). Still think that this is an incredibly fun game.

Very good cooperative game that plays up to seven players and creates a lot of tension because of the potential traitor among the group.

The tension and suspicion is encouraged by some clever design. Playing sets of numbered cards isn't all that thematic or interesting. However, the fact that in some cases you can choose to play a card face down to draw a new white card creates tons of suspicion.

Good game, nice design. I usually don't like thematic games, cooperative games, etc.. but Shadows over Camelot is quite good, not last too long and my mates like it (very much more than me!). However after some number of games it becomes been boring to me. Despite my mates laments I decide to sell it.

I've had a complete change of mind after playing the game again; this is a good game, straightforward and a fun cooperative struggle against almost overwhelming odds. (Well, if they're not overwhelming, then the game makes them seem so.) I'm really looking forward to playing this more.

RATING: 7
This is a really solid game. Don't let everything going on intimidate you, it's actually really simple and allows for a pretty flexible strategic plan. The potential traitor is what really adds to it though by adding a hint of paranoia to the whole experience.

Based on only one session it seems to have the inverse excitement curve to Betrayal at the House on the Hill where it starts off really intense as everyone is struggling to complete the major quests but once those are done it's kind of just grinding out the repeatable quests until they're complete. The traitor also doesn't have too many ways to actually betray the group. The only thing the traitor can really do is play sub-par.

A solid cooperative game with very good bits and presentation.  The introduction and possibility of a traitor makes this unlike other cooperative games.  Easy to draw players into the game.  For first time players, it may be best not to use the traitor, but it should be required in subsequent playings.  Card draws will impact the outcome and players will have to adjust to the situation.  Keep game play moving or the game will drag and take longer than desired.  [GTI Code: TGCL]

I heard about this game forever, but only got around to learning and playing it in 2015, to find that it is, in fact, outrageously fun, and deserving of the hype. Cathala and Laget knocked the feel of the legends out of the park, and I enjoy the simplistic card mechanics and the thrill of choosing which Quests to pursue, or enemies to clear, all the while wondering if that Traitor is out there... The production values are great, components good, and it's not hard to teach anyone of age, even if a few of the mechanics do seem a little scattershot.

I love this game.  It is like Battle Star Galactica (Light).  There is still intrigue, but not quite on the same depth level as BSG.  This is also easier for most new gamers to pick up.  I have had hours upon hours of fun with this game and have probably played it over 20 times easily.  I also love the theme of King Arthur, so that is also a plus.

Great game, always willing to play!

I'm not a fan of co-op games to start with, and I ended up as the Traitor in my first (and so far, only) game of this. I had a couple of issues with understanding what was going on, and a couple more to try and make any 'poor' plays seem less problematic. The theme is the one that makes me most inclined to take part but the length is reducing my interest.

I hated this game the first time I played it.  I was the traitor, but I played it totally straight.  I kept waiting for my big moment of betrayal, but it was ultimately unnecessary, because the good guys lost to the game.

After playing it more, it grew on me.  Now I like it just fine.  We still argue on the best way to divvy up the quests, so our lack of group think allows the traitor to spoil things without outing himself.

Very fun and thematic team game, with a traitor - or not.

The possibility of a traitor is especially fun when you have border-line unscrupulous team-mates, who, despite being on the good guys team, will not trust other team members to get the 'treasures', and so will act super-shifty, despite being on the 'good guys' team.

I've had games where the traitor was playing just a bit sub-optimally, and the rest of the team fell into anarchy without his help.

Overall, with the right group of people, a great game.

Could have been a very interesting game, but on my first run through, without a complete explaination of the rules, I wound up being the Traitor and not knowing how to properly play, at the same time feeling like an outsider and a liar.  It did not set well with me for a game that many people seem to really enjoy as a coop game.  For me, there was nothing Co-op about it.  I may play again, but I would have to be assured that I am not the traitor so that I can get the proper feel of the game.

UPDATE: Played again as a loyal with a full table.  Enjoyed the game more the second time around and can see how a traitor can work in this game.  Might actually play again, even with the hopes of being the traitor.

One of the first games with the traitor aspect.
Up to 7 players and 1 may be the traitor.
This is a cooperative game where players play against the game, however one of them may be a hidden traitor sabotaging the parties plan.
You go on quests; excalibur, holy grail, whenever you win a quest you gain benefits, namely white swords that enable you to win the game, or black swords if you lose the quests.
The components are very good, and the game is very interesting.

RATING: 9.5
A touch stone game that I traded away and regretted to the extent that I have required it again. Yes, there are newer and, argueably, better coop/semi-coop games out there today, but SOC was something of a progenitor to several very good games that have borrowed from its mechanics. 

The reasons I have taken it back into my collection: it looks great, plays quite quickly and can always be relied upon to draw non-gamers into a slightly more involved game with the near universal outcome that they are keen to play more games. It also has that Days of Wonder knack of being a visual and tactile treat to bring to the table.

I own a handful of games I can think of (Zombicide, Bootleggers, A Touch of Evil, Pandemic and Flashpoint) that have the capacity to inspire interest among both gamers and non-gamers alike, and offer an experience that is equally satisfying to both groups. That is high praise indeed.

Beautifully looking cooperative (mostly) game that works even with non-gamers that can wrap their head around a few simple rules. I would propable not play the basic game with 7 players since the single traitor that might be present is somewhat underpowered compared to the rest noble and honest knights. Slightly longish but worth the effort,especially if you like the theme and the traitor possibility intrigues you.

Most games were obvious how it was going to end before the game finished, but I've had fun. May need to play with the "Must get a white sword to end" condition to keep it tense. Several of my plays have been with my 'motivation' variant.

If you have a full game, once you've played a few times it feels like it's fairly easy to win (at least, it seems that way to us). I suspect we need to start playing with the squires variant (and perhaps motivations as well).

Very conflicted about this.  On the one hand, the components are typical DOW -- freakin' excellent.  Gameplay is engaging.  However, one problem the game has is that it lends itself to a lot of kibitzing, so the game tends to drag when it shouldn't; however, I'm of the opinion that you really have to play it with 7, preferably 8.  Another drawback is the depth of the rules for people anticipating a lighter sort of game.

The success of this game seems to depend on the strength of its social interaction more than its mechanical design.

With the right group, this can be a fantastic game.

Sadly, I have actually played a game in which the player who was the traitor literally never did anything but help the knights of the round table and still won.  That kind of put a bad taste in my mouth.

Too much downtime.  Also, I think that if all the good guys play completely perfectly, that the traitor has almost no chance of winning because any poor play sticks out like a sore thumb.  So to maximize your win percentage over many games you would have to play sub-optimally when you are a good guy, so that you can sneak in a bad play or two when you are a traitor.  But that requires repeated games...and why not just play Battlestar Galactica with its hidden cards?

RATING: 2
When I first purchased this game (it was my first plunge into hobby gaming, after many, many years of M:tG), I thought that it was brilliant, simple, intuitive, streamlined, and engaging.  I was in love with the game before I ever even played it due to the traitor aspect.  This game started out as a 9 for me, but the more I played, the more bored with it I became.  Our actions became predictable and repetitive, and it seems as if this game really does play itself.  My coop game of choice is Arkham Horror, and now I have Pandemic to pull out when I need a gateway co-op game.

If you still enjoy this game, then you probably haven't been in a 7 player match where you are on grail duty.  That is not a game.  The replayability on this fades quickly.  If you must play it, don't use more than 4 or 5 players, for the love of all that which is good in gaming!

A beautiful game by Days of Wonder with impressive components. Game play is fun as you try to beat several quests before the quests beat you. The addition of the traitor makes it much more interesting. I'm beginning to really like this game mechanic of hidden agendas. Bang! is another game that has it but here it is more subtle.... A wholly enjoyable experience for the whole family!

I really like collaborating to beat the game...and the traitor, if one exists.  The psychology that comes into play wondering if a traitor exists within your merry band, and who it may be, is an outstanding element in this game.  I have yet to get dealt the traitor card, but I hope it's soon, as I want to experience the strategies of foiling the quests, and to see if I can get away with it without being accused.  The art and bits augment this offering as well.  [Father's Day Gift]

Great cooperative game - with a twist - a traitor.  I love games with secret traitors.  This has more of a game to it than the resistance, is far less complicated, long, or fiddly as battlestar galactica.  Over all, I think this game is a fantastic middle ground between the two!

This game improves exponentially when playing with the possibility of a traitor.  The rampant paranoia and player-watching that occurs is fantastic.  Feels almost like a more structured version of Werewolf.

[i]Posted: 7/11/06, Rated: 8[/i]

At first glance, [i]Shadows Over Camelot[/i] presents an impressively daunting façade.  King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table sally forth to triumph over the forces of darkness.  With such lavish production values and so many [i]parts[/i], it was a bit difficult to sell this game as being easy to learn.  Our perseverance was ultimately rewarded.

[i]Shadows[/i] is essentially a set collecting game, one where players work together to build sets one card at a time.  Sometimes these sets are like [i][gameid=1115][/i] hands: build two pairs, or a full house.  These familiar analogies made it easier for me to explain the game to new players.

If that was all there was to the game, then it would be average at best.  Of course, there is more to it.  [i]Shadows[/i] was the first cooperative game I had ever played, where players were trying to beat "the game."  When that goal started to lose its steam after a few plays, we introduced the "traitor" role: each player draws a "Loyalty card" and keeps it in secret.  There are more of these cards than players, and one of them says "Traitor."  One player [i]might[/i] be a traitor trying to thwart the success of the other Knights, but there is no guarantee that the role is actually in the game!  This simple wrinkle adds a healthy dose of paranoia, and can induce some incredible mood swings -- usually from elation to utter despair.

The richly-colored game boards, and the molded pieces help to foster a sense of wonder and adventure.  I can definitely see the allure of painting the game pieces, like the ones seen here:

[ImageID=93329]
I decided to pick up a copy of [i][gameid=20229][/i], and the painted figures do enhance the game experience.  It becomes easier for players to associate with their characters.  Role-playing can be cheesy, but it also adds to the game.

Combine a novel idea for most players (a cooperative game) with superlative production values and a fantastic theme, and [i]Shadows of Camelot[/i] is a grail of a game.

Good cooperation game, with the traitor twist. Can end up in a ridiculous way if all knights play safe and defeat siege engines when white swords are safe.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A cooperative game - Arthur's knights try to protect Camelot, but there's always the possibility of a traitor in their midst.  A great cooperative game, and the traitor is a fine twist.  Best of all, you can play it in an hour and a half, and it's tense all the way.

Over time, the game soured a bit with my group, as they felt they had established a dominant strategy. I think there's still a lot of fun to be had in managing risk and clever card play.

Battlestar Galactica has done the traitor mechanic better at this point; I need to test some house rules to smooth out the traitor. There's just too much variance in, say, a 5-player game, between having a traitor (nearly impossible) and not.

Blech, I just don't understand this "game."  In the realm of co-op games, this is at the bottom of the barrel.  Its predecessor by several years, Lord of the Rings, did the co-op thing much, much better.

At the risk of sounding like a Knizia fanboi, he is just leagues ahead of other designers.  I'm not guaranteed to always like his games, but I can be sure the game is tightly designed and balanced out of the box.

Shadows doesn't seem like a finished game, save for its presentation.

One of the most painful near misses for me. Fantastic theme, fantastic artwork, co-op with traitor mechanics sounds awesome. But the actually mechanics are a bit thin and don't always feel thematic. Often times it just feels like collecting and playing sets of cards. And there's isn't much room mechanically for satisfying subterfuge if  you're the traitor. Not that's it's a complete bust but this is one of the only times where I wish someone would copy this theme and put a meatier game into it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Beware, this is NOT a board game, its a card game with a box full of beautiful but unnecessary componants. 

Lots of downtime once a player embarks on a quest as you have nothing to do but lay an ordered set of cards. The randomness of the card draw seems to void the potential for any applied skill. 

There is a danger that once a successful routine is found then that would will set the mould for future games. Experienced players will become frustrated if new comers didn't toe the line for ideal combined play. New comers  may become irritated at being 'advised' what to do.

If this was packaged in its simplest form as a card game with some rule tweaks I might score this a 6. As time passes my resolve to never play this again strengthens along with my beief that the game misfires on all cylinders.

The more I play this game the more it bores me. First time I played it I would give it 7. After a couple of tiresome games I would rate it six. Now after having easily beaten the game 3 times in a row I have had enough of the game. It is like playing patience just with many players putting up the cards.

SOC is such a good game! There are better co-ops out there IMO (LOTR, Pandemic). The thing that makes SOC so good that those games don't have is the Traitor. Every move every knight makes in this game is questioned because of the thought of the traitor. It makes for a very social experience. And when you're the traitor and you convince your right hand neighbor to put the next-to-last seige engine on the board, priceless! I love it!

Good game, but for me the fun of this game is trying to determine who the traitor is (or may be).  I understand the complaint of some people that this game is nothing more than moving to a quest and then spending five or more turns playing one card at a time (which can be boring), but I enjoy spending that time trying to determine who the traitor is, as well as routing for my fellow knights in their attempts to defeat the other quests.

Really fun with 6 or 7.  Any other player count and this one falls flat.  The extremely short turns make it work well with a large group, and strategizing as a group is really more useful than strategizing alone because you are personally restricted by your cards.  Asking for a team consensus on moves is a good idea, unless the traitor sneaks in there.

Beware loyal knights of Camelot for there may be a traitor in your midst. But if you are stout of heart and strong of arm you may prevail and spread the light of justice far and wide.

I find this game to be painful. The theme is excellent, as ae the pieces, but the gameplay is boring and repetitive. The bigest plus for the game is that it often gets very tense towards the end. 

But frankly, I'd prefer to beat myself vigorously in the head with a hammer. It's just as painful, but it doesn't take as long.

A great cooperative game for up to eight players with the Merlin expansion (which we barely use besides the extra player). The traitor mechanic is much fun! We generally don't even try this game unless we have at least five people, as it's so much harder to win otherwise. I love this game, and it's such a great feeling when you win! It's a bit polarizing in that people who hate to be told "now, we're probably going to lose" don't like it.

An excellent role-playing style experience.  The cooperative aspect makes it a huge plus for me, and the traitor adds a lot of intrigue to the gaming experience.

It seems too easy in large games... we've played a couple games with the traitor never being revealed, and we won fairly easily.

It's probably more challenging in smaller games... but in my opinion, the decisions are very basic and there's too much downtime for the simple decisions one has to make.

I'll play it if everyone else wants to... but I'd never recommend it.  Interesting only the first time.

We played it with my regular gaming group three times.It feels more like a card game where you sit and look at a board...and the aspect of the traitor and the co-op didn't make it any less so...

This is the great grand-dad of two very popular genres.  First it helped usher in the popularity of co-ops (along with Knizia's LotR).  Second and more importantly the game brought the hidden traitor/semi cooperative game into the lime light.  People are quick to dismiss this as a themeless Euro where all you're doing is playing poker hands.  The simplistic ruleset is KEY for players to quickly internalize so they can get to meaty traitor aspect.  Sure the game might have been outclassed later by games like Dead of Winter and Battlestar Galactica...but it is by no means irrelevant.  It's very simple to teach and works well with almost every player count.  This game is a bonafide, modern day classic.

Many people on this site really enjoyed this game the first few times but quickly lost interest.  With me it was the opposite -- a lukewarm game or two, followed by a steady increase in my opinion of it.  I really enjoy it now.

The traitor makes the game, but I find he has too hard a time to negatively affect the game much without it being blatantly obvious.  This is especially true if you play with no extra loyalty cards -- if you know there's a traitor, it is very easy to spot him unless he's laying low, but in that case he can do almost nothing to hinder the loyal players.

I recommend playing without a guaranteed traitor -- say, one more loyalty card than players. There should [i]always[/i] be the possibility of no traitor, so you can't be so certain of your suspicions.

I do like that, after a game, you really feel like you accomplished something, that a story had been told.  The game will always be talked about at length afterwards.

This was surprisingly fun.  Almost wish I didn't trade off my copy.  Our first game we were so scattered on what to do that we just got crushed.  No real leader and I think this game you somewhat need one.  It was tense as the evil built up and overtook the knights.  Much better than Pandamic, but a lesser game than LotR.  I think. 

I would definately play this again, but only with six or more people.  But, I wouldn't want to play this on a regular basis, to keep it fresh.

First cooperative game I played. A fun game with no optimal strategies as far as I can tell, which helps to eliminate the 'alpha-player' problem that some people have with games like Pandemic.
It can be frustrating to be able to do so little on your turn, but at the same time this means that it will be your turn again that much sooner. Plus, everyone is always interested and involved in what everyone else is doing.
Overall a very fun game that works well as a family/gateway game and as a serious gamers game. Just make sure to always shuffle in a traitor.

My first coop game.  Very hard to win.  Knights complete quests to save Camelot, if they fail, Camelot falls.  Teamwork is key to winning.  Game components are outstanding, they don't come better than this.  Complaint: After a couple plays it feels like I'm playing group solitaire.

Our first co-op. We moved on to BSG, but Shadows is still fun to go back to, as I enjoy the Arthurian theme/flavor. Always a memorable game session.

RATING: 5
You would think after seeing Lord of the Rings that Days of Wonder would have an easy time making at least a moderately enjoyable cooperative game.  It was not to be.  This game is just boring.  Tons of downtime, little cooperation and mostly trivial and unengaging decision does not a good game make.  To elevate this game I think the black cards should have options that, while all painful, requires a choice from the player.  I find this suggestion unique as few German games ask for such decisions.

Nothing truly wrong with Shadows Over Camelot; it elicits neither disgust nor praise from me.  A truly mediocre game.

One of my first games. Lots of fun, game feels overwhelming at times because there is so much to keep track of (in a good way). Part of the rating may be because I'm crazy about a King Arthur theme.

RATING: 9
A game that is easier played than described. We had the devil's own time making sense of it until we played. Then the basic mechanisms integrated well, gameplay was smooth, and we could concentrate on strategy. This is a game that really comes alive with many players.

RATING: 8
The Traitor mechanism makes the game.  Yeah it's a glorified card game, but it's tough and later in the game every turn becomes crucial, which typically means lots of good discussion.  

I think this game is even more fun when you're the Traitor, much like Fury of Dracula is more fun as Dracula, or Last Night on Earth is more fun as the zombies.  Or maybe I'm just antisocial.

RATING: 7
I have yet to play this with the traitor so I imagine that once I do play it that way, my rating will go up. Really good cooperative game although I think they could be a bit more explicit on the table talk rules. Keep in mind that I don't play cards that much so table talk rules etiquette is a foreign concept to me.

Lavishly produced, this cooperative card game plays very much like Knizia's famous Lord of the Rings game (and seems to me to be about as good). But considering that it IS a card game, some might wonder if the product justifies the expense of the miniatures. I'll need to return to this one to answer that question, but my impression so far is favorable.

Lots of fun.  I have always loved cooperative games and found this to be one of the best I have ever played.  My two youngest sons watched the first 3/4 of our first game and then asked to join.  King Arthur (my wife) knighted them and they entered the game just in time for us all to lose together.  Even losing, everyone went to bed on a excited high.

Both of the designers were present at the evening and there was a magnificient big  maquette present where you could play the game on.

I've actually sold this one off.  I really enjoyed the first couple plays but realized that I had no interest in replaying it after three plays.  A pretty cool game in lots of ways but it lacks a compelling mechanic for me.

My buddy Ted should post his home-made mods.  He's painted all the figs beautifully and, even cooler, made his own Sir Puss-In-Boots character -- he begins the game with 9 lives instead of 4.

Very fun game wth the use of a traitor.  The amount of players greatly changes the effects of the traitor, but does not diminish the enjoyment for me.  At some point it becomes a puzzle and not a game as the traitors optimal play are obvious.  Tense game.

Excellent co-op game. My fears over the poker hands were completely unfounded. Once I got my head around the style of play it went very smoothly and everyone enjoyed themselves.

We've now had two group games and next time I'll propose the traitor should be potentially included. Very nice game and not too hard to teach. Lots of fun and a great theme.

It's just gone up from 8 to 9 because I'm still playing it with friends and family and it's still a rewarding experience.

More and more fun with this game. A real family and friends favourite and I'm not getting bored, still lots to do.

Best cooperative game I've played, and unlike some others there's some varability from game to game. Top-notch components and design.

Supporting up to seven players, this game is ideal for larger crowds and on nights when the group is more interested in bluffing, bargaining, and socializing than beard-stroking.

The co-op game with a twist. You have to play this more than once to get to grips with it (which is why I probably suck!) but I can see why this is a well liked game. However, for me, Pandemic is a better co-op and is shorter too. Shadows wins out with a larger nuimber of players though, I played it with 7 and it was great fun.

One of my three favourite games. A co-op where you have to beat the game, where there may be a traitor in your group, where tension builds and winning feels like an achievement. THe only thing I don't like is that winning can be a little formulaic with a few games under your belt.

RATING: 5
Really want to like this one...and I do...kind of. The production values are excellent and I'm a sucker for collaborative games - I'm just not sure how many meaningful decisions are involved. Don't get me wrong, the game is usually a lot of fun, but after a couple of 4 player games where we were thrashed I just don't have the urge to pull it out anymore. The traitor aspect appeals, but the fact that we can't even win when he/she *isn't* meddling with our plans (and the suggestions that placing siege engines every turn is a surefire strategy for the traitor) just leaves me feeling a little 'down' on the whole thing.

I ranked it a 9 because packaging shows little forethought and I am a stickler for details.

Juego de traidor oculto, entretenido aunque a muchos jugadores pienso que es facil ganar y a pocos es facil perder. Y el papel del traidor es demasiado sutil con el que puede tener en otro juegos de este estilo como Galactica o la Resistencia.

RATING: 7
This game was easily an 8 or 9 when I first started playing it. The game play was great with only the abstractness of playing number cards to complete quests being my only dislike. (how does playing number cards have anything to do with knights?) 

However, after playing Battlestar Galactica I can't help wondering why I would play Shadows over BSG.  BSG just does everything better, particularly theme and mechanics.  About the only thing shadows does better is you can play three games in the time it takes to play one game of BSG.

So while not a horrible game by any means I'd chose BSG over it anytime and it still scratched the same itch.

RATING: 9.5
What a great game!  Unbelievably difficult and the thought of having to draw a black card actually distresses people!  I kid you not I have a friend who it physically shaking and will put his head down when drawing a black card.  It really amplifies the anxiety during the game.  And we haven't even played with a traitor yet!

I can say with confidence this will go up in ranking when a traitor is added.

5 player game. Was the traitor. Won after placing a siege engine during advancing evil on my turn after 11 were out on the board. Seemed a bit too easy for the traitor to win.

I gave Shadows Over Camelot an 8/10 because I enjoy it and it's really fun. It has a few problems, though. It can't be played with just two people, and I don't find it very interesting with three people, so I don't get to play it as often as I like because it's sometimes difficult for me to get groups of four or more together. The random nature of the battles means that the game can be lost from dice rolls, rather than from lack of play skill. I wish there was a way for non-battling players to contribute to the success of a battle (a logistics card, perhaps?).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Decent cooperative game. Very pretty graphics with nice bits and relatively rich in theme. Play can seem quite procedural after a while as the variety of calamities is limited and the order in which quests are done a bit scripted . Contrast with Battle Star Galactica for example.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not a great game, but can be amusing with the right group. The good action/evil action mechanic really sets the proper mood. Good theme.
My main problem with the game mechanically is what happens when you reveal the traitor. If you accuse the right person, you get a white flag. BUT, the traitor is then free to openly oppose Camelot with no loss of ability. When they are still "in cover", at least they have to pretend to help out every now and again. It seems better to just let the traitor stay hidden!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

One of the few games we have for 8 players. Hard to win if the traitor is not revealed and it's hard to reveal the traitor if you play it casually with chatting and beer drinking.

Nice co-operative game, I think I prefer it to LoTR, just because it plays quicker and the traitor possibility adds to the experience. Quite tough 3 player, especially if you also allow for a traitor. Might not stand repeated plays if we 'solve' it, so rating might fall. *** Update, rating has fallen, this game works if the traitor gets into the theme and doesn't go all out to stop the knights from the start but stays 'hidden' for a while, otherwise it's just too easy to help the system to win.

RATING: 10
Even though it's fairly limited on its own, this is the perfect way to introduce your friends to cooperative gaming, and it's so much fun to play with selfish people who are not yet used to the concept of cooperative board gaming. I think this game blends the perfect amount of challenge and accessibility, making victory realistically attainable, even if you have to resort to desperate measures for the sake of your comrades.
While the there's only a few different quests to embark on within this game, you won't have to worry about the experience becoming too repetitive due to one aspect of the game that always makes it interesting, and that's the prospect of a traitor being present amongst your group.
It's the brilliant addition of a traitor component that keeps me coming back to this game. The constant, looming distrust, and fear of fully committing your resources to any one player that can bring your team to victory, due to the prospect that they may, or may not be a traitor, is what makes every single game interesting and fun. Without that singular, brilliant addition, this game might be a little too limited to fully recommend.

That being said, its limited quests can easily be fixed if Days of Wonder would just release a few more expansions for this game that added more board pieces, but so far the only expansion available only adds new cards and characters, which are all great additions, but don't do much to breathe new life into the game if you aren't already in love with it. I really wish they'd add more quests, and new board pieces.

Just got this game over Christmas season.   No other game like it - it is as if you are playing against a computer  and it is extremely hard to beat.

This is a must have and it offers pretty decent bang for the buck.  We love this one.

Awesome Game!  Heavy in theme.  You are one of a group of brave knights heading of to battle dragons, save relics or even save your home... Camelot!  Do you have what it takes...?  

This is a great game for a family get together, or when maybe you have a few more than four players.  

Assign the knights.  Takes turns...Evil Action-Good Action.  Quickly respond to Evil actions building by on quests or removing those dreaded catapults.  This game is different from any other game but refreshingly so.  I can't think of another like it.  

This game is a cooperative game and works well at introducing non gamers to games not so much like: Risk/Monopoly.  



Some players that I know have become bored quickly of this game but if you really sink your teeth into it, this game has curve balls to throw and can be a really fun hour.

Even though a few others came before it (Lord of the Rings comes to mind), this is the game you can blame for the number of cooperative games you see today.

I used to enjoy this game, till I realized that we don't ever seem to lose anymore (though that's probably due to the drought of no traitors being drawn the past few times we've played).

Never quite fathomed cooperative games much, and this one has some character to it, quite elegant and reasonably balanced but in the end, seems little more than draw a card, play a card, draw card, play a card.

RATING: 6
A fun semi-cooperative game (one possible hidden traitor). I agree with BGG wisdom that 3 is too few players; I have also played a 2 player game with each player running two knights, which worked OK to learn the mechanics but wasn't as tense as a full game.

More cooperative and semi-cooperative games have come out since this was published. I still like the mechanics fine, but all the sub-games get complicated to explain, and the theme doesn't do much for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Good job of putting lots of thematic elements into the game.  Lots of options.  My initial impression is that it's very hard for the loyal knights to win.  Looking forward to playing again.  Update:  This seems to be a slow game, particularly when played with more than five players (of which some are newbies).  On one hand, I like the concept of the game and some of the elements.  On the other, it can really drag, differences opinions about appropriate communication limits can be a pain, and the big deck of cards can make things really (overly?) random at times.  Rating of 6 is based on 3 plays with a lot of players each time.

SoC is a fun collaborative game though it does have replay issues if you tend to play with the same people again and again.

I agree with those who say that it really boils down to the play of one player -- Arthur.  If he does a good job of funneling cards and leading the group, then the group should do well.  Arthur can convert the game from a cooperative activity to everyone do as I say.  The traitor aspect makes a difference; use it.  A game that I will play on rare occasions, not a regular staple.

Quite a fun board game. We played twice with 7 players each time. Seems quite built around the mechanic of giving the traitors ways to screw the team without seeming obvious. That said, the 'good' guys in our plays didn't come close to winning and I don't think the traitors had too much to do with it: just bad luck and it's hard to win.

RATING: 8.5
I really love the cooperative game/traitor mechanism. This game is a pioneer in these aspects. Always and over the whole course of the game interesting - even if it is not your turn.

Most likely there will be one big tight moment near the end when you have to discover traitor(s). The game gains a lot from the Merlin expansion and the possibility of 2 traitors. Best player count: 7 or 8 with expansion.

All players should know the important cards like Fate, Guinevere, Avalon and the journey cards in the Merlin expansion.

As a traitor you feel a bit restricted at times. Battlestar Galactica handled this aspect better later. Anyway I always really enjoy the game - whether I'm a traitor or not.

I avoided playing this for the longest time since I already enjoyed playing the LotR coop games. Now owned after playing an enjoyable 7 player game at BGG.CON 2008. Though Shadows does have some similarities with LotR, the theme and layout are different enough to allow for a nice change from the latter. If not for the traitor, the game would not be near as exciting to play, as the approach to victory seems to be apparent - crowd as many loyal knights into the Grail quest early and get Excaliber. Seems easy to win when there is not traitor. Probably should pick up the expansion.

RATING: 9
So. What's best about this game? Definatly the ever present feeling of impending doom. You never seem to catch a break as a loyal knight, always lacking behind the forces of evil. But still, it is actually possible to win. This game has gone from an "8" to a "9" for me - not many games does that...become better and better the more you play them

While the game is based on matching poker hands as "challenges", I like how it all works out. The traitor mechanic, one of the original, of there might be one, but not necessarily is done really well in this game. If you like the King Arthur theme, highly recommended. Surprised me by how much I enjoyed this game.

RATING: 4
This is much more interesting than  Lord of the Rings  (which I find linear, lacking in theme and math-intensive) but, as a fellow co-operative game, and sharing several similar mechanics (heroic self-sacrifice, random nasty events, etc) I'm still unconvinced.  As a roleplayier, I love co-operative gaming but I'm not sure board games have achieved that properly yet, to my mind.  This does have truly beautiful pieces though; they're really quite exceptional.

RATING: 7
11/23: From the few plays I've had so far, I generally like SoC thematically and gameplay-wise. However, I hate the traitor role for a number of reasons.

As the traitor, I had the hardest time playing sneakily while still trying to hurt the loyal knights. So hard, in fact, that it wasn't fun for me at all. I now dread drawing the traitor, which in my opinion, should be the role you look forward to drawing! If you try to really hurt the knights early on (siege spam, etc.), then you're outed immediately (once it is possible to accuse), and you usually win from siege overrun. However, if you do this, then you are not really keeping with the spirit of the game, and you're ultimately ruining the game experience for everyone else. If you go the sneaky route, you are eventually outed because the other players notice you are traveling too much, offering bad advice, going for Lancelot's armor first, tossing quests, dumping cards at the sword quest, etc. etc. It's way too hard to operate in the darkness (cards are revealed to everyone, etc.), and it's way too easy to win by ruining the game.

In the end, the traitor's problems are my only real complaint. I love the teamwork aspect, the theme, and the fact that you can play this with a large party, so I'd definitely recommend it. Maybe someone that loves SoC will mod the traitor's role someday? I'm sure there's something you could do to give the role more options than just "playing inefficiently."

VERDICT:

One of the better co-op games around, and I recommend it for bigger groups. The traitor role feels incomplete, or at the very least, fairly impotent (especially if you play with a group experienced in SoC). That being said, I'm still usually willing to play it. 

7/10

This game is really cool.  The cooperative angle throws some players off at first, but once the game gets going, this aspect becomes much more appreciated.  The Traitor adds a nice twist, making this one of the most tense games I own.  Great fun, winning is more illusive than it first appears.

Played for the first time with the family.  Everyone seemed to like it, but we were also "cheating" a bit.  They suggest NOT playing with the traitor for the first game or two and I second that notion.  A lot to get used to in the beginning.  But we were also all sharing our hands with each other which we really should not have been doing.  It seems like it will be REALLY hard to beat the game without that level of "cooperation" (especially once there is a traitor in our midst).  We will see, I guess.

UPDATE: Played a few more times and I really do like this game.  It can be hard to get to the table as you need some time and also need everyone to agree to play it.  I would say you need at least 5 to play...7 is better.

RATING: 4
We mostly played this not as intended, as we usually just told everybody what cards we had and what we were planning to do. In general that's what I like in co-op games: everybody talking about their options, suggesting plans, and together coming up with a strategy to win. With this kind of table talk this game becomes much too easy and boring. You don't have much to do on your turn and in the end you can even guarantee victory several turns ahead: just calculate how many turns you need to finish and then stop drawing events, talking damage and placing catapults instead.

Having a traitor in the group makes the game more interesting, but the traitor himself often didn't enjoy playing much. It's quite difficult to sabotage without revealing yourself. And after being revealed, it's boring to be the traitor.

I realize this is not how it is meant to be played and I'd like to try it again with "in character" talk, but it irks me that it's so vague in what exactly you're allowed to say.

Excellent for 4 players without a traitor, 5 with or without a traitor, or 6 players with a traitor.

It really requires the players to work together, employs some interesting elements by giving each knight a special power, and it has a great pace starting off kind of slow, but escalating quickly.

Despite the fact that in all the games we've played thus far (not many unfortunately) the forces of evil have triumphed, this has been one of the most enjoyable games to experience that any of my group have played for a while.  Full of action and fun, this game is great!

Update - having played one game where the forces of light whomped in a victory and had time for several games of tennis in-between questing I wondered if we might have figured the game out.

There is only one game that does everything better as far as cooperation and saving the kingdom goes and that is the early republic scenario of Republic of Rome.  But at the same time, the simplicity of this game is enough for players to quickly learn the system.  Also, the game is much less formulaic than Knizia's Lord of the Rings game, plays that magical 7 players number, and is just a lot of fun period. Probably the closest thing we'll see in the near future to a streamlined version of Republic of Rome.   I don't think the replayability is there (correction - the replayability is not there!) though but we'll see.  Without a traitor, the game falls very flat.

Thematic, intense, beautiful. Shadows over Camelot is all these and more when it comes to talking about the greatest cooperative game, but... is it? It puts so much on the table (literally as well) while still being light enough to introduce to newer players. The miniatures are beautiful (it's a shame I have no artistic talent) and the artwork is amazing, showcasing the level of quality that Days of Wonder put into their games. The main gripe is that the game is boring for the traitor unless they can really embrace the theme, and it can drag a lot as everyone tries to stall a loss. Everyone else has decisions to make and discussions to have except the traitor.

Close cousin to Knizia's "Lord of the Rings" but not as good.  The components and artwork are beautiful, the theme is strong, and the traitor mechanism is a lot of fun.  The first couple of plays are fantastic and exciting.  There is not much variety in the card decks, however, which makes the game repetitive and mechanical after only a few plays.  Everyone should try this game because it truly is a blast the first few times, but I'm not sure how well it will hold up to extended play.  I hope Days of Wonder has some expansions in the works to create more variety!

The game flows well enough, but the decisions seem artifical and just driven by the game.  At least the traitor adds flavour.  The evil deck does make the game very tense.

Fun, fun game.  Played with a great group of guys.  We laughed a lot, role-played a little, defeated the traitor in our midst, and overall created a very positive experience.  But if I never played the game again, that would be okay.  I'm not sure what it is, perhaps the "role-playing lite" in the middle of a very structured Euro doesn't work for me?  But if this game isn't transcendent with the perfect group for this type of game, then I am not sure how I can regard it any higher than a "6".  I am glad people like it, though, and the production values set a new, higher standard for components.

I based my rating strictly folllowing the provided rules. This is a gorgeous game. I truly wanted to love this when I finally bought it (after months of yearning). I've played this now 6 or 7 times with various numbers of people. The first few plays were fun only because of the novelty. It was my first cooperative game experience. The last time I played was with a full complement of players, a few of which were new to the game, and it was dreadfully boring. One of the players actually fell asleep.

Now my 15 yr. old son recently played this with two of his buddies and they loved it. One of his friends went so far as to say it may be his favorite game yet.

UPDATE: The thing that makes Shadows over Camelot unduly frustrating is the fact that Knizia's Lord of the Rings exists. Given that Shadows over Camelot makes so many mistakes that Knizia clearly showed designers how to avoid, it's frustrating to see Shadows stubbornly refusing to learn from what has gone before. It's a mediocre game as it is, but the existence of a 10-rated game that is so similar is so many ways, except that it works, makes Shadow's failure all the more inexcusable.
---
I may have actually been too generous in my review. As we've been playing more, I've come to the concluions that this game - in addition to its mechanical problems - simply isn't fun. It's mind-numbingly tedious with large numbers of players, and the number of decisions you get to make is tiny. Decide to go after the grail ... and you don't have to think again for forty minutes. Days of Wonder and Fantasy Flight have apparently figured that they can compensate for mediocre gameplay with overproduced bits; don't tell them they are right. I am profoundly disappointed with my fellow-reviewers for the unvarnished praise they have heaped on this game.

I wonder how much this has to do with the fact that the Arthurian theme is really just not that compelling anymore. Taking advantage of some of the recent re-imagining (like Gillain Bradshaw or Monty Python) would have made a more engaging game, I think. These days, Arthur is more interesting for its historical place than as drama, and games need drama.

Boy, this game leaves me feeling like a cheap whore.  All the pretty bits and the intrigue of the possibility of a traitor makes me feel like this game should be more interesting.  But the longer the game goes, the more I want it to be over.  How can it be so dull when there are seemingly so many rich touches?

I think it boils down to the fact that, really, it doesn't matter what you do.  The bad cards will do what they will and you will conspire with your fellows to make sure you've all made the best moves possible, but the game will end and you will feel like there's nothing you could have done to have changed the outcome.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Shadows over Camelot's lavish production values and distinctively French artwork has "Days of Wonder" treatment written all over it, adding to the already positive buzz concerning this company.

The cooperative gameplay - not entirely unlike that of Knizia's LOTR - benefits greatly from the added twist a possible traitor in the knights' ranks provides.

Whereas Knizia's design is more linear in character, SOC sees Arthur's valiant knights fighting on multiple "fronts". Juggling these various threats and opportunities is part of the fun and prompts plenty of discussion round the table.

Whereas LOTR in my experience encourages one general to direct and coordinate strategy to some measure, SOC sees more independent play. 

I strongly recommend playing with n+1 loyalty cards. Without the traitor dimension the game is reduced to a puzzle lacking that delicious psychological dimension.

However, SOC isn't entirely without problems. I fear the endgame MAY turn out to be anticlimactic, say if victory is assured and the knights actually WANT to lose a number of quests to lose the game. Certainly, LOTR does better in this regard. Mordor almost always is full of suspense.

Furthermore, the late game may well see many knights on catapult-bashing duty. Not terribly exciting, really. Particularly if you're waiting for a couple more black swords for the game to end. Really a problem I'd adress with a set of variant rules were I to play this game regularly. Were this not a problem, I'd rate this game higher.

Now, which of these two siblings do I prefer? Hard to say. I love the traitor role and the ambiguity it provides and the multiple "fronts" (reminds me of some of my favourite wargames, btw) in SOC. Yet for me LOTR scores somewhat higher in the theme category and does a better job telling the story. The quests in SOC, as well as their rewards and penalties, are somewhat too Poker-inspired for my tastes to quite satisfy my Arthurian appetite, if you see what I mean.

On balance, LOTR feels more like a puzzle whereas SOC plays more like a game. After all you're not only playing against the game, but there's possibly also that evil traitor out there...

Cooperative game. Sounds good at first, nicely designed, but the half-dozen of games I played thus far always ended in arguments and hatred amongst the players. The game depends on its nice design and King Arthur theme. It is all theme, no play.

Somehow some "cooperative" players always seem to know what everyone else has got to do, or everybody is openly discussing their hands (=cheating). However, even if all players manage NOT to EXCHANGE too much game related information through out-of-game gossip, I think it is kind of boring to anticipate the strategy of an evil random card deck...

Just knocked it down to 6 from 7 after a quick play.  It was interesting and novel when it came out, but now I would rather play some of the other cooperatives than this.  It does have a lot of theme, so for a group very much into theme and RPG mechanics it should work better.  The traitor adds an aspect not in some of the other cooperatives I've played.

The game is particularly complicated and long considering it's a pretty shallow game of set collection. 

Also, unlike most traitor games, being a traitor in this one becomes extremely dull once you are revealed as there is very little you do from turn to turn.

I really enjoy Shadows. I love hidden roles, agonizing decisions, tons of tabletalk, and lots of tension and this game has it all. Whether you're the traitor trying to remain hidden until just the right time, or a loyal knight trying to figure out who the traitor is (and even if there is one to begin with) while struggling against the game itself, this game is filled with tension. It's always enjoyable to watch things heat up toward the end of the game as everyone gets more accusatory and the loyal players are scrambling to find the traitor. Shadows might be a little simplistic in terms of mechanics, but getting into the spirit of the game and the tense atmosphere make this one a keeper.

Knights of the Round Table? Traitor possibilities? Sounds great. The game play is a little flat, but I think the theme makes up for it. It's a theme that I'm not super familiar with, except for Monty Python... :)

This game is fun and balanced (if there is a traitor or an overwhelming possibility of one). The interaction is great, the game is totally innovative. The production value puts this game at the top of my list in terms of aesthetics.  Now for the problems with this game, or more to the point the people playing it. This game is not cooperative. Whoever says that is a fool. You can't play this game cooperative. If you don't play the game with the traitor, the game is totally uninteresting. Sometimes, you have to lose to win without a traitor. Huh? Sounds like the game is 80% finished, and broken without at least an overwhelming possibility of a traitor. If you play the game with the traitor or the idea that anybody could be one, it is not cooperative...it is everyone for themselves against the traitor. My problem with this game is people don't play it the way it should be played. I think players should keep their mouth mostly shut, and their eyes open, instead of the other way around. You should pick the traitor out of the lineup of prospectives based on their actions, not on their thoughts. People seem to talk way too much and ruin the experience. This has gotten to the point where people have talked so much and crushed the game so badly that they have to play with this Squires variant. The problem is not the game, it is the way you play the game. It has to be, because the game is way to simple to be glorious one time and a horrible experience the next.  People should play their hand, and talk about who is the traitor, instead of "Hey, I have a 4 fight card in my hand." One of these days, I will pull a group together that understands this and end up playing a great game.

cooperative games must be played with the right group in order to succeed. I really like co-ops and so does one of my gaming groups in particular (as well as my younger brother whom I game with frequently). I played it twice with my family and it was a big success! We did play without the traitor as they aren’t really gamers, and even though I’m sure the game is much better with the added tension of the traitor, I still liked it a lot. I have since tried it with a couple of friends and they all enjoyed it too. 
I think it’s a very different coop game than the “usual” Pandemic/Forbidden Island/Flash Point: Fire Rescue/Defenders of the Realm etc. which is obviously a good thing as I don't need yet a co-op like those. This one certainly isn't!

I liked how you needed to decide between three bad things to happen before you could do one good thing, and I think the rule that you aren’t allowed to talk about which cards you have on your hand is great (even though it’s sometimes obvious to the others which cards you have when you say something…).
I loved the different types of quests which feel unique. Furthermore, the tension of which black card you draw is tense. The only negative is that the game might run a bit too long and that the ending can be a bit anticlimactic as you can actually plan to win by losing a quest… Still, it’s a great game.

Four plays so far (7 / 8 / 7 / 5 players). The true knights lost horribly each time. The game is too long for the 'fun' it offers and decisions are relatively few and far between. The possibility of a traitor is the best thing about this game and is the most interesting role but I'm not sure that unmasking him really benefits the group as he can be openly evil at the cost of a couple of swords.

April 2009: hitting the table all the time; students here at school are requesting it every weekend and recent games have been some of my best gaming experiences in years. Some of my best gaming experiences ever were with this game. 

UPDATE AFTER LEAVING THE RESIDENTIAL HIGH SCHOOL WHERE I PLAYED IT: All and all, I think my group took it so far, so overboard, and so passionately over-the-top that I don't know if I can come back to this as a player again. We were sweating, swearing, worked up, disgusted, elated and it was almost too much. And I wouldn't trade those experiences in the slightest.

The game morphed into a true test of masculinity and self-worth when played with the ruthless 'gifted' teenage students I lived with for several years. Bringing the game to the brink of personal battle was done as a test of one's metal and trustworthiness. At the extremes it became Klingon knights-of-the-round table. And it was glorious. But regular Shadows was becoming 'almost' too easy and adding the Merlin expansion was just too hard with so much inherent group tension.

At this point, I would rather teach the game. I don't think I played at all in my last year at the school because counselors aren't supposed to break students and I think I still had a gear or two more to my game. Maybe I'll play with adults next. And mixed genders! Even if I still think the game shines brightest when played with a cohort of bright, competitive, stressed-out teenage males. The game where we almost all had to give our lives on the last turn to barely, barely edge out our very first victory remains my greatest single moment of gaming elation. We were lost, ...but providence honored our sacrifices.

07/2012: At this point, not getting play since I am no longer living at a boarding school. Dropped rating because I don't feel drawn to play it, but it will always have a place in my collection. 

10/2015: Saving it for when I can bring it out to a new group. This will be fun when my sister's children get older.

This was the first hobby game that I ever got. It was a gift from a one of my best friends in 2005. For years it set on the game shelf beside Star Wars Monopoly and Sequence and Life. Now it sits on a shelf with it Days of Wonder brethren. It doesn't come out too often as it is a little too heavy for our usual game bunch and not great with two players but as it was the first game, I have a strong affection for it. Plus the art work and the bits are all fantastic.

First (and only play so far) was without a traitor, so my rating is based on that.

I get the general impression that a lot of the cooperative games have a tendancy to play themselves, and such tendancy is directly related to the amount of table-talk that is allowed.  Not sayinig that is bad or good, but different.  Shadows over Camelot is fun, for sure, but is another in what may be an overused mechanic - i.e. "beat the game together".

I have a strange feeling that playing with a traitor at the table can result in a much different play experience.

Not a huge fan of collaborative games, but this wasn't bad.  Played this four times over the weekend, two without the traitor option and two with.  I think the viability of the traitor option depends on the number of players. In one game, with only three players, I was the traitor and found it pretty easy to win against the other two.  I could see that a traitor against 4-6 loyal knights could be an interesting game, but I don't think two loyal knights really stand a chance against a traitor.  Once I had gotten Lancelot's armor, I played the Fate card which allowed me to reveal myself as the traitor, as I felt it would be easier to win with the actions available to an open traitor than it would be in hiding.  A valid gameplay decision, I think, but it doesn't seem very thematic.

Also, the endgame suffers once you have enough white swords to win; just stay alive and avoid getting too many siege engines, and you can let black cards pile up on the Black Knight and Dragon Quests to get sufficient black swords to end the game.  Definitely not thematic.  It's as if the Knights of the Round Table were lounging around and saying, "Well, we've completed enough quests this year.  I don't particularly feel like saving a village from a rampaging dragon today."

Out first exposure to it was as the last game of the night, post-midnight and all a bit knackered. 15 minutes into the game we were all wide awake and on the edge of our seats. No joke! It reached the point where we would rather sacrifice life points then turn another of those blasted black cards. Even though we lost, the after game postmmortem extended right on into the wee hours. Fantastic.

RATING: 6
Shadows Over Camelot is the first game I owned that was collaborative with a traitor mechanic. And at the time, I loved that concept.

The successful games have been with friends that allow themselves to get into the theme a bit and don't treat it totally like a numbers puzzle. Plus, the traitor element is essential to prevent someone from being a bit too heavy-handed with their advice and guidance.

It's great with the right group, but it's the enthusiasm from other people that gets this to the table, and not my own. I'll happily play it, but I'm looking to other options currently.

Update: I eventually traded this one away. Space Alert and Escape are my go-to collaborative games, and if I want a traitor, then The Resistance and Shadow Hunters provide that same experience in a much quicker package. This game just sat on the shelf for too long, so I ultimately traded it away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I was surprised by how much I enjoyed playing this game and I agree with the others who have played it before that it really depends on the group. Since you know there is a traitor among you it definitely adds to the tension in this co-op game. I found the game to be rather difficult as we barely had 3 swords before we lost. Maybe we got all the bad cards up front, but I do feel luck of the draw between the two decks can really swing this game. I would happily play this again, but I feel it needs a group of gamers to work well as I'm not sure how some of the non-gamers I am around would pick this up given the secretive nature required.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is simple enough to pick up relatively quickly but can be a real mind game when it comes to trying to exposing the traitor (whether real or imaginary).  Depending on the players and the luck of the shuffle, it seems to play differently every time.  It's held my interest for longer than I thought a game of its type would.  As with many cooperative games, planning is definitely a must at the beginning and throughout the game--and it can help expose the traitor.

The main problem I have with this game is that some players try to "quarterback" the game excessively, which takes the fun out of it for me.  If everyone playing is at about the same level of vocalness, it works much better.

The best quote I've heard during a SoC game was directed at King Arthur right after he revealed himself as the traitor:  "No wonder Guinevere is sleeping with Lancelot!"

One of my favorite co op games. Terrific theme with beautiful miniatures. The traitor element is unique and fun and surprisingly well balanced. The game has a tremendous amount of depth yet is still easily picked up by novice gamers. It will take a few game plays to understand the nuances of the game and to know what to look for with a particularly defensive traitor, but that only makes the game better in my opinion. Being a big fan of Arthurian legend, it can be a little stressful to see Camalot in such dark times, but if a game makes me passionate, that can't REALLY be a bad thing, can it?

Very enjoyable cooperative game.  The element of the traitor adds a great level of tension.  Haven't played enough to see if the cries of "too hard" or "too easy" are justified.  I certainly don't see the "too easy" argument.  I'm more inclined to think a traitor with only a few players makes the game very difficult to win.  However, instead of taking on lots of rules, I think it's just best to avoid playing this game with only three or four players.  The game seems to click better with more players, anyway.  Five or six might be the sweet spot.

Update: Still fun, but for semi-cooperative games, I would always play Battlestar Galactica instead of this one.  That said, it isn't as easy to get BSG to the table as it's quite a bit more complex.

The first time I played this, I felt like I was indifferent to the game but willing to give it another shot because I was playing with a random crowd of people who were either baffled by the rules or teetering on the brink of a nervous collapse.

Fast forward two years or so, and I give it another try, with a group of people I am confident are neither dimbulbs or emotionally stunted rageaholics and ... nope, I just don't like this game. Like Pandemic, it's a jumped-up set-collection game. Unlike Pandemic, it lacks the stripped-down elegance, speedy run time, and knife's-edge tension that makes for a quality co-op experience. It's 45 minutes of fun in a two-hour package. The game itself went down to the wire, but there were long stretches where I was limited by the shape of my hand to obvious and uninteresting plays (since the quests are slow, incremental progress in, for all intents and purposes, moving a marker up and down a track) on my turn, which is an experience not practically dissimilar to [i]downtime[/i].

The possibility of a bad guy in the mix adds a bit of spice but I think the difficulty of making a good game with the traitor mechanic is understated -- you have to design a game where the traitor can subtly but not undetectably bring down the team, and you have to balance the risk and reward of unmasking him/her. Ideally, you would also create incentives for everyone to muddy the waters. A game like this [i]could[/i] work in interesting ways but I have yet to see a game where it [i]does[/i].

Personally, I find games where the opportunity to defect (in a game-theoretic sense) is an organic decision by the player in response to emergent incentives (cf. Republic of Rome, Incan Gold, Article 27) to be more interesting than games where you simply get assigned a white or black hat from the get-go.

I see little reason to play this game in a world where the Resistance series (which even includes an Arthurian themed game ferchrissake) exists; The Resistance is itself an overrated game but it distills the interesting part of Shadows into an appropriate running time.

I've played this game 3 times since owning and overall I'd say it has been very enjoyable.  My only initial concern is the table talk can ruin the spirit of the game (and the challenge).  With the right crowd this can be lots of fun and the traitor aspect does give the game that shadow of uncertainty, which works well.

Simply a great co-operative game in that you have the choice of playing fully co-op, co-op with a traitor or co-op with POTENTIALLY but not necessarily a traitor. Solo play (with several loyal knights) is also possible and can be made challenging enough to keep you on your toes.

Unlike some other games, Shadows over Camelot is not unforgiving, so you are allowed to mess up some things and even the worst black (bad) cards cannot spoil the game for you just after it started. (I know of games that CAN ruin all your setup work by poor card draws early on.)

To make this game work optimally, some roleplaying is required. Getting just the right amount of roleplaying may be the greatest challenge. It generally depends on your playing group how much you want to introduce.

I loved this game the first few times I played it. However, my love quickly faded away, and I now find the game   boring. It's basically the same game every time. There are not enough changes to make me want to keep playing it. (10+ plays)

Another cooperative game with a "traitor".  It always kind of leaves me wanting more from it.  I mean, I don't really feel satisfied after I play it.  I don't really know what it is but I always feel like something is missing.  I guess I want more depth and feel disappointed that that is all there is to it.  Can be pretty fun with a full group if they are rowdy and loud.  The worst thing that can happen to you is to be the traitor.  After you are revealed it is lame because the best strategy is just to add more catapults.  Too bad really cause it is a cool theme and great components.

Fun co-op with a traitor mechanism.  This game has held up pretty well over the years and is a lot easier to teach to new gamers than BSG or Dead of Winter, in my opinion.

This is a "party game for gamers" and even though I tend to prefer playing gamer's games, I have played this game more than any other in my collection. The Traitor mechanic makes this game a wonderful party game and I have been known to play this game several times a night until early the next morning when given the chance. 

If anyone starts to find this game becoming "too easy", start handicapping with everyone drawing one black card each at the beginning before the actual oath of the round table to give the game a head start...or just buy the "Merlin's Company" expansion. :)

GameStorm 2015 Math Trade fodder. One of my earliest post-BGG gaming era purchases. Sort of sad to see it go for that reason. But it never sees the table, and I doubt that it ever would have. Buh-bye.

---

High production value on all the bits, as usual for Days of Wonder. The cooperative aspect is welcome amongst non-gamer friends and family. Everyone will feel like they're being slowly crushed to death, but at least it's at the hands of circumstance rather than another player who may be better than you.

Unless of course there is a traitor in your midst. The traitor is ultimately the redeeming quality of this game. Without it, you're just working together to beat the system at tug-o-war.

I bought this one and went through all the components, read the books and so far am ambivalent. Part of me is excited but part of me fears this will not have a great replay value. Because this game requires 3 player minimum (and preferably more than that) it could be a while before I play it.

The first time I played through we ignored two key rules. We didn't play with the traitor and we didn't notice that the second hero action in a turn is not allowed to be the same as the first. The game was easy. We quickly filled up the white swords and had to grind to fill the table to end the game. It kind of sucked.

I just finished my second and third plays and it was way better. The traitor is awesome, though I think it could still be left out in small games. We did a random draw on all 8 role cards so that there was some chance that the traitor wasn't included, but he still showed up in both games. The biggest change, however, was the second action bit. Without being able to double up on quests, the game is much harder. We lost both games. We were close on the first one, but evil surprised us with a 2 seige engine attack, which filled up the board. Good tension. Good fun.

RATING: 6
This game is difficult to rate for me. I've only played once and I enjoyed it a lot. I think (as usual) the Days of Wonder components and presentation are fantastic. I also really enjoy the cooperative nature of the game. 

But I played the traitor in my first game (which was great). I dragged my feet and squandered a few things a couple times, then ultimately revealed myself through obvious actions when I thought it would serve no further purpose not to. The thing is...in hindsight, I could see nothing I could do as a player/traitor that would be as disruptive as simply declaring immediately and adding siege engines every turn. There is no actual incentive for the traitor to pretend to be a player, other than the joy of the roleplay. So...while I really enjoy the game, I think in some respects its broken. I'll have to review the articles and see if there is a sensible fix for this.

I've enjoyed a few games of this now, including one that will live in gamer infamy for a beautiful and timely betrayal on the part of a cagey player, but all in all I think this game is much too easy for the good knights to win and there are not enough interesting or powerful things for the traitor to do.  Ah well, it's a flavorful and entertaining exercise for the most part... too bad it isn't more strategically interesting.

I think I don't like cooperative games.  I can't say this game wasn't worth playing once,
but I doubt I'll play it again unless backed into a corner.
It might be fun to screw with people though, by setting your own personal victory conditions, by say, playing just poorly to get them to wrongly accuse you of being the traitor after a certain amount of time has passed.  But that would just be cruel.

Didn't like it at first and put it on the shelf for several months. Now it's one of our favourites. Suspicion and verbal accusations abound in our group. Even after several dozen sessions, we still don't have a consensus on the "best" move for loyal knights in every situation.

I was really disappointed. I was hyped and this was not that good.
I think it is too easy as a traitor also really boring. You don't really have to think about strategies just throw catapults on them.
On the other hand good components from a more than 10 years old game and engaging atmosphere.

Update from 6 to 5.
Since BSG exists this is very unlike to see table in our group. If I add the fact I sold Dead of Winter for the same reason which is a very good game and I gave a 7 to it I lower this 6 to a 5.

To sum up how Shadows Over Camelot makes me feel, I have one word- hoodwinked.  The first couple of plays were golden, and I thought the game might even be great.  The theme was there, there was intrigue, and it was challenging.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that the game looks dynamite and is very accessible.  However, after playing it several times, I started to realize that without the traitor mechanic and the cooperation, it's really just another rummy-derived set collection card game.  There was also a point at which I realized that the game with an incompetent traitor was impossible to lose and a smart traitor is completely unbeatable if he realizes that playing catapults every turn will win the game every time.  The traitor element is much better handled in Saboteur or Cash & Guns.  It's really a shame, because it seems like this should be a great game but it just isn't in my opinion.  I certainly understand the appeal of the game but I think gamers looking for depth and replayability would be best advised to go elsewhere.  I cringe every time I hear someone say "anybody up for Shadows"?  I'm not suprised it's so popular though, given the apparent mantle Days of Wonder has been christened with and the appeal that glorified childrens games have to many of the folks here on the 'geek.

Want to play this more, but it's tough to get five or more people together when something bigger isn't already planned.  Terrific looking game, and the play is tense.  There probably isn't much replayability here, and after a dozen games I don't think that this would come out much.  But I've only played a couple of times, and I'm ready for more.

Review Pending: I don't want to offend anyone, but with all the card combinations, it feels like rummy. Of course, in rummy, you can't claim the Holy Grail, to save the life of King Arthur in his battle with the dragon, so that he can kill the invading Picts, and save Camelot from evil. 

Fun game. Plays well with new people.

Finally, a difficult coop game. The game presents several different defeat conditions, and with the potential traitor element the game really does a god job of avoiding the alpha gamer syndrome. However, the down time between turns just knocked the energy from me. Maybe I need a different game group to enjoy this one. I'll (reluctantly) play it again, but I won't buy it any time soon.

To be honest, this game has not been explored enough for me to give a full opinion.  It's only hit the table two or three times total.  I'm not sure my group really understood the social dynamics the game is built around and instead played it as a rather dull co-op with one of the players being incompetent.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Seemed good for a while but winning rarely came down to any good strategy on my part but was more based on the experience or competence of all the non-traitor knights. Without breaking the tabletalk rules or bending them to the point where they may as well not exist, this game proved difficult to win with the group I game with. I'm sure if I played with just experienced logical gamers it would be a very different experience. I wonder if that will ever happen since it lost its shine for everyone in the group pretty quickly.

We really likes this one early on.  The problem is that as players get more experienced, the harder and harder it becomes to be the traitor without being discovered.

Too much sizzle and not enough steak!
First play w/ 6p was just okay.  There was a certain point, even before I revealed the traitor, that I felt there was no way to win the game and that our demise would just be dragged out for several more turns.  I was right.  Not happy about it.  Feels like something is missing.  Feels like very little progress is made on each turn.  We completed no quests and won a single war with the Saxons, but that's it.  Not having a traitor would have been just as difficult.  You have several options on your turn, but most feel unproductive.  Even if you are able to add a single card to a quest each turn, I feel it's not enough.  Perhaps it's the age of the game design, but I doubt it.  Something is missing...  TRADED

I was surprised to find that the rating for this game actually went down for me after more plays. First off this game really looks great. The bits are all amazing with attractice cards, and great minis. The game itself is fairly straight forward and easy to learn. Quite streamlined, but still a lot going on. The possibility of a traiter also really adds a fun twist. After multiple plays, however, the weeknesses of this game show through. The theme really seems somewhat detached. What I mean by this is that the quests don't really have much to do with each other, and practically any theme (or no theme) could just as easily have been attached. You are essentially trying to make regular playing card hands in order to win. The theme isn't bad in the game, but it isn't as rich as it first appears. The feeling the game gives you is of being pulled in many different directions. The problem is that you pretty much have to go where you have the cards to go, or make due if you are forced to go somewhere. There aren't any real big decisions in the game. Overall, I still enjoy this game, and it still deserves a decent rating. I don't, however, believe that this game is as good as everybody first thought it would be or the hype presented it to be. You'll like it, but my guess is that you probably won't love it.

Unique game. Don't play if you don't like cooperative games - or at least hope you're the traitor

You can also play purely cooperatively, and not even use the traitor.
This game seems pretty hard to win, unless eveyone "helps." Better not to tell each other too much about what you're doing.
I don't know if this will have long-term staying power.

RATING: 6
Tough game to rate, since I love most of the individual elements but don't feel they mesh into a partiuclarly astounding game. I may be missing the entire point here, but I think the traitor is this game's weak point. I don't like the idea that either player X will win, or everyone else will win - I prefer either full cooperation or full competition. The possibility that you can die and be taken out of the game is one of my pet peeves - I want everyone to be in the entire game. These aspects wouldn't be too bad by themselves, but the game itself is pretty mean, and some of the event cards are really, really vicious.

That said, when everyone's cooperating, I love the game...

I was quite impressed with this game the first couple of times I played it.  After a couple more playings, my ardor has somewhat cooled.  It has some possible downsides: (1) it can take a while to get to your turn and then there's not a whole lot for you to do, (2) once the traitor is revealed, the game can become obvious/slow/tedious for that player, (3) it's possible that the strategy for the loyal knights can be "solved" - in any event, there's a question of whether the game has extensive replayability, since we seem to see all the white cards every time we play.  Having said all that, I still enjoy the game and would be willing to play and it's still on my "buy/obtain" list (though a bit lower than it was).  I'm more aware that a good portion of the enjoyment of the game will come from the players, so it will not succeed in all groups.

This game would be ranked higher if I ever got to be traitor.  The last game we ended up winning with no black swords and even still I had a good time.  Now with 9 plays, still haven't been the traitor.  But it is fun.  Play with people who are willing to role-play a bit, or it will turn into a fairly dull game.

This sat unplayed for over a year waiting for my kids to grow into it.  On our first family playing, we played it twice.  

On the second game, we introduced a traitor.  It turned out to be my eldest son.  I didn't know it until the last round when I stared him down and he had a big smile on his face.  He won.  I'm so proud.

Great group game.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** El shadow of Camelot no cabe duda deque es una copia decente del Señor de los Anillos colaborativo del Knizia. Personalmente me ha gustado un poquitín más el SoC ya que existe el traidor o similares y pueden jugar 7 personas, y yo diría que más ya que no creo que haya problema por meter más fichas. También esta bien eso de que alguien se incorpore a mitad de la partida, queda chulo y en casi ningún juego se puede hacer. Este es un juego que mucha la gente lo odiará, y yo mismo dudo de que sea un eurogame, lo tildaría más de party.[/COLOR]

I use this game to introduce people to cooperatives.  The basic game is very good, although easy for the loyal knights and hard for the traitor.  The variants included make a more difficult and more enjoyable game.  Plays awesome with seven people.

RATING: 7
Beautiful bits and board as always from DOW. Great fun for the first few plays. Unfortunately there isn't much variety in quests or cards - the few possible quests in the game are essentially very similar "card laying" exercises, and after 4 plays we already began to feel we'd "been here before", and replayability will suffer badly for us as a result. An "almost great" game which somehow just fails to grab me due to its inherent lack of possibilities. Would have been a "6" for me, but those great figures and bits give it an extra 1. Nice to add to your collection as a birthday gift, but if its your own money there are far better games out there.

2005-07: Played five times so far.  Have yet to introduce the traitor into the play as have only played with three people.  Fun and challenging.
2005-09: the traitor definitely makes things more difficult.  Only played with traitor in a four-player game.  Word on the Geek is that you need five.  Want to try that!
2006-04: playing with five is definitely where it is at with this game.
2006-10: this game seems to have run it's course with us.  It's just not getting to the table anymore.

Lowered my rating on this one after playing with the traitor for the first time. We knew fairly early who the traitor was and were not able to do anything to stop him. We were playing with 4. I think in the future, if playing with a low # it is best to wait to hand out the cards.

This is a semi-cooperative game.  There could be a traitor who wants the group to fail (get more black swords around the round table).  But as a whole, we try to complete the quests by gaining cards and fighting hoards and whatnot.  It's an okay game, but felt like it outstayed its welcome.

Now that I seem to have a winning strategy for this game, it goes a lot faster and good wins an awful lot. 

It will need more plays to see if it will actually work with a single traitor now we know what we're doing. But this is better than never getting near an end because of not knowing what to do!

My first co-op game which gave a very memorable experience. So much so ,that I also purchased several other co-ops. But this has a special place in my collection. With the added traitor element in the expansion our gaming group was exuberant. The component
and graphic quality was top notch and we played the heck out of this game. Gradually Pandemic took the throne ,but
we all have fond memories of our "Round table" plays.
Battlestar Galactica never did tempt me though.

Really need to sleeves this game, black card's edges get easily marked after a few light plays. The Mayday Games purple Standard USA Card Sleeves[MDG-7040] fit the cards and they easily go back into the insert. Expect this on any used game you purchase. The cards are good quality, it is just that running the black color to the edge of the card that is the problem. 

Note: MayDay Games sleeves are cheap to buy, you can within a pack get one or two that are too tight. Two packs will be needed and give you extras. And no, I am not B&M-ing like some, these things can't be easy to manufacture and have all of them to specs given the material and how close they fit cards. I am amazed how well they do. You want sleeves that fit with some slack, poke you when you play, more than double the price, then buy FGG. Very tired of seeing, being told of that long over beat debate.

So so so long i didn't want to play this game. It looked complicated and not that much fun. Than i got talked into playing it...best decision ever. This game takes hidden roles the way i like it. And to know that there is always a traitor among you is so much tense. Accusations, judging looks...and all that with tons of fun. Gameplay itself is easy to understand and playing as traitor does require lots of skill to go undetected while undermining the quests.

RATING: 3
I pretty much only play this game when my extended family/brother wants to play it. They love this game and have made me play it for maybe 10 years now, and I think I'm about done playing it forever. Its just really boring for real gamers and too complex for non-gamers . There are simpler and better social deduction games. If you have too many players you always have at least one player start getting bored and stops paying attention, and you constantly have to remind them its their turn, which is super annoying.

I can hardly blame anyone who gets bored, however, because you have such limited actions in this game. Are you out of cards but want to fight the Black Knight? Go to Camelot. That's your turn. Draw cards. That's your next 3-4 turns. Go to the Black Knight. That's another turn. Then lay cards down one at time for 4 turns, assuming you have the right cards. The traitor and loyalty thing is really dumb too. The traitor can't do practically anything out of the ordinary for three quarters of the game or its obvious its them. After that, they can turn the game from a win to a loss in one turn without really any counter play from the loyal knights. Its dumb. 

And don't get me started on the whole "you aren't supposed to tell others what you have in your hand" thing. It turns into people constantly dropping hints about what they have, but making sure that hint is not TOO obvious or it would be against the rules. But the hint was good enough everyone knows what you are talking about. Completely stupid. 

I can see why people love this game. I just really don't. Every time my group wants to play it I suck it up, but inside I'm secretly groaning.

I enjoyed the fact that each turn involved making a hard decision as to which would be the lesser of evil actions.

I don't see how this is a game. You stay on one place taking one card at a time each turn and you spend whole turn to move (since that is all you can do on a turn) and then stay on one place placing one card at a time each turn.

There are some decisions you can make (a little more when betrayer is in the game) but it doesn't change the fact that you are basically helpless. All you do is collect and spend cards. Btw those cards have no mechanics. They are just numbers and you have to match them. And if you want to react to something that is happening on the board, you have to spend at least 3 turns to do it (1. move back home, 2. move to the location where you want to do something, 3. play a card). If so happens to be that you don't have the card you need, only more turns of doing nothing.

Played this elsewhere a number of times and liked it enough to buy it - and then found that I was never in the mood to pull it out. I think it's a play-time issue - while [i]Shadows[/i] can be fun, it takes long enough that fun-per-unit-time is lower than many other games. (That plus the Grail quest, which annoys me from a design perspective - everything else is "what do you do with the cards you've been dealt", there it's "oh, I got these cards, so I guess I ought to go play them".)

I must admit, I was drawn by pretty bits and rich theme. But, it's not as fun as Arkham Horror. Although it's kinda fun a game world in Arthurian legend, I couldn't help feel a little bit empty when playing it. Unlike Arkham where you need to do couple of things to close the gate or something, in here, to progress basically you just discard a card. It's the adventure feeling that lack, not to mention the release of Battlestar Galactica, which is better in EVERY regards.

Production: Quality components. Days of Wonder sets the new standard for how to produce a game.  The artwork is immersive, and the figurines are so much better than would have been token equivalents.

Play: Having only played once, and as the traitor, I do not have an accurate sense of this game. I dislike being in this role, and so my experience has been colored accordingly. Many have expressed a problem with cooperative games that the decision-making can be driven by the most experienced player; my gripe is rather than the game is not intelligently plotting against us, but rather randomly (or by some predictable probability) throwing challenges at us. My one playing of this game didn't suggest to me that it is an exception. (3+1+3) (1 play)

A cooperative game with the possibility of traitor amongst the Knights of the Round.  Relatively easy to learn, tough to master, this game will chew you up and spit you out if you don't work together.  The paranoia of trying to ferret out any possibly traitors creates a great tension, and everyone is engaged the entire game, making sure to catch any potential slips by a guilty party.  The theme here is wonderful, and as always, it looks beautiful on the table.  A delight to play.

RATING: 7
I'm not real fond of co-operative games. In Pandemic, one person generally controls the game and everybody follows. That aspect can exist in this game, but doesn't have to. Everyone can be working on their own objective, with the help of other players and still feel like you're making your own decisions. Adding a traitor to the mix is a nice aspect as well. It's not difficult to learn and gameplay isn't overly long. Theme is maintained.

RATING: 5
There really just are not enough "interesting decisions per player per minute" (my ultimate way of viewing a game) in Shadows, so its lightness overcomes it. The inventive cooperative-but-with-a-betrayer mechanic was good for its time, though done much deeper and better later on by Battlestar Galactica. In the end, though, this game wants to be played with a lot of people (more like 7 than 3), but that party aspect also makes it harder to like, because a given player has fewer turns in the game, and each turn has just a few things to do -- maybe one interesting decision. So while I admire the originality of the design, and there is some subtlety here, there ultimately isn't enough mental engagement for me to give it more than a 5.

I love playing Shadows Over Camelot because semi-cooperative gameplay is my favourite. The game is beautiful and the theme is really interesting! My complaint with the game is that the heroes can just ride the coat tails of their past successes to victory without doing much for the last couple rounds or so without being too threatened by the traitor, so it's often anti-climactic barring evil card drama. With more than 4 players, the Merlin's company expansion makes it much more difficult and exciting. Any less than 5 players with the expansion can be extremely difficult for the heroes.

Shadows over Camelot has excellent flavor, art, and cooperative gameplay. However, the "single action per turn" mechanic feels limiting sometimes, and the game can drag on, especially if several turns in a row oscillate the game state. I kind of wish there was a "ko" rule, where the board state could not be repeated on the next turn. That said, I really enjoy the way the game throws multiple challenges so that the players have to manage their collective resources, and I feel that it is really balanced in terms of who can do what. I would highly recommend this game to a seasoned veteran of other cooperative games such as Pandemic or Arkham Horror.

Edit: After playing this game once a week for two months as a start to game night (it has rules for people to join/leave as necessary) this game has lost a lot of popularity, because there always seems like something else people would rather play. It is a nice game to have in the collection, but not a must buy.

Anyways I hope to get to this again some time but it's a little more hard core (not the mechanics, but the game play).

This game is very fun to play!  S.o.C. is made up of 7 mini-games, or quests, which are really quite simple.  Each player works together, or individually, to build hands (sets) of cards to defeat quests. This, at its very root, would be boring but due to the level of interaction because of the chance of there being a traitor, this game is soooo engaging!  Our first game consisted of LOUD accusations, laughter, and surprises.  We all immediately wanted to play again!  2 games later... and I was so glad I purchased this game.  I can see why this game has held its own for so long in the cooperative genre.  If you've not enjoyed cooperative until now, try this game... it is fun!

I really was not that impressed with this game. I might of hyped myself up before playing this, but I felt like the option that there might not be a traitor is kind of lame. I played this a couple of times with different people, and I always keep giving it a shot, but it always falls flat on me. I think every time I plat it that maybe this time will be different because I am playing with different people, but alas it always puts me to sleep... Just not my game.

RATING: 9
One of my favourite titles, a challenging coop game that can sometimes have a traitor in their midst. Plays best with a group that gets the theme and concept and has fun making teasing accusations amongst everyone, and has some good decision making too even if that might be a touch more on the simpler side. Recommended to everyone who likes coop or fantasy, and doubly so to both.

You and your friends will band together to defeat evil!

By making poker hands.

Dishwater-dull gameplay is enlivened by the possibility of a traitor working behind the scenes to screw you all.   Unfortunately, the rest of the game is so repetitive that it's difficult to care until you get down to those last few moments, where one traitorous act could be the difference between a final white sword and a black one, and, and, and...

Oh, Kevin, it wasn't you?  But you were acting so suspicious!

I'm just not willing to play an 80-minute game for 5 minutes of good stuff.

The artwork and the pieces are stunning.

RATING: 5
About as good and bad as Battlestar.  I love the theme, but the gameplay does not contain enough "interesting decision" moments.  It is like a game that puts you on rails.  Prone to leader quarterbacking.  This one is slightly better than BSG, but only because the game takes less time.

Shadows has mostly been replaced by Battlestar Galactica for me, especially in our gaming group.  Still a great game, though, and a great game to introduce non-gamers into gaming.  Hated the expansion, though... happy to stick with the base game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Shadows is a great game that allows the group to beat the game.  This is a great game for "beginning-medium" board gamers.  The hardest thing is for people to understand all the scenarios and how to work as the "team."  Adding the traitor and other levels of complexity make the game more interesting, but can also just add to the headache of the gameplay.  The diabolical nature of the traitor is not nearly as "cool" as it should be, but does add value to a cool game.

Played for the first time and it was great. I was really concerned since I am a big Fan of BSG (I don't get play enough though) and a lot of people say that BSG is better. Yes it is better, but SoC is so much easier to teach and to get casual gamers to play since it is much more accessible. Also the play time is shorter which makes it more likely to hit the table with my gaming group. Will try to get a few more plays in before buying the expansion.

RATING: 7.5
Despite the problems some have outlined, I am interested in the coop and traitor aspects of this game.
UPDATE: many plays  in I have to rate this a 6. Its a shame really, but as soon as the traitor is discovered the tension and fun of the game is gone. In fact if the rules automatically ended the game somehow once the traitor was discovered, this game would rate much higher, like an 8. I have tried variants for the knights, and the chrome on this game is absolutely first rate. But seriously after the traitor is uncovered, this game grinds to the finish line. If you find a variant that adresses this, consider the rating raised.

Shadows Over Camelot is a fun game to play with people who are big fans of the Arthurian stories and legends. In it you play as Knights of the Round Table in hopes of saving the kingdom. Sometimes though the game might have a traitor (I was my very first time playing.) I will play this game if I have enough people that are willing but sometimes the game unfortunately sits on my shelf because not a lot of people where I'm from are big fans of Arthurian legends. Still a great game if you can get enough people. Preferably about 4-6.

RATING: 7
Finally had a chance to play this. Enjoyed it, though it did seemd to have some oddities in the rules and mechanisms...  
The "you may not share precise information about your cards" part seems to be a bit weird for a (semi-)cooperative game. It seems to be the worst possible solution to the issue of needing to provide cover for a possible traitor.
The quests aren't all that interesting mechanically. The "puzzles" are very straight forward. Play a card. turn is over. On the other hand of course it's nice and streamlined but it really made me think about more interesting ways of collecting sets or poker hands (which in return might have given more possible cover to a traitor).
The end game was a bit unthematic and dragged on a bit...  we managed to get to 7 or 8 white swords but then still had to get  the roudn table filled up...  which made us accept the failure of quests just to get up to the full 12 sowrds...  arrghh!  that was weird!  
Despite some shortcomings (seemigly so, on repeated plays perhaps these things would turn out to be non-issues?), i really had a good time playing it and thought it was a worthwhile experience.  
Willing to play again anytime!

RATING: 7.7
The theme, the production, and the concept behind this game (cooperative with maybe a traitor) are awesome.
Emotions run high when player´s knights are battling to resolve the quests before Camelot is under threat.

Unfortunately, the game as a couple of serious problems:
With few players (less than five) is almost impossible to win and there is no traitor (which takes out part of the thrill), so the game is only worth to put in the table if there are 6 or 7 players.

Simpler than Battlestar Galactica and plays much quicker, this game gets right to the point with quick player turns and awesome art and components. The simplicity is not to be underestimated and I am hoping there is a lot of strategy for the betrayer in this game despite some obvious ones that can get easily detected besides negotiation power.

I'm not attached to the theme but it works decently well here.

One of my favorite games, this is a coop game that can play 3-7 (which is always nice) and one of the best parts is that people can join during the middle of the game and it doesn't affect anything at all!  The traitor mechanic makes the game much more tense and interesting as you are always keeping an eye on the other players to see if they are doing anything suspicious.  Definitely on top of my prefer to play stack.

Traitor is the best element.  Must have players willing to role play and have fun.  Over analysis and rules quibbling just drains the game into a boring excercise.  Not sure about replayability, maybe with some card & quest expansions this will be no issue.  Great theme and a winner for a group of young boys infatuated with knights, swords and the like.

RATING: 7
I had a rough time rating this game. I wanted to like it more but there's a couple of problems I had with it. The traitor aspect of it is really essential (which rubs some people in my game group the wrong way) - without the chance of a traitor in the group, there is one overriding strategy that mostly works. Also, the rules were a bit "fiddly". We made several mistakes in our first few games that I only cleared up after reading the FAQs.

That said, my group was fairly lukewarm to it initially and have warmed up to it. I feel the Merlin's Company expansion adds a much needed variety to the base game.

I have played numerous co-operative games and Shadows over Camelot is still my favorite one of the lot. It's not just the possibility of the traitor.

This is the one co-op game we have which doesn't suffer too much from "Hail to the Chief" syndrome. Since everyone's cards are hidden, and since your cards determine which quests you can effectively pursue (and since there can be traitors), each person has more control over their individual roles than something like Forbidden Island.

Top notch materials.
Gameplay is a little bit flat: great knights playing poker combination to defeat evil and complete eroic tasks.
Additionally, players have to make (obvious) decision only once every 2/3 turns. The presence of the Traitor is the only thing that prevents one from falling asleep during a game. However, the traitor element negates its value as gateway game.

I like Lord of the Rings better, since it fatures more dynamic and deeper gameplay.

Excellent cooperative game. It has a nice variety of quests that require players to pay attention in the planning stages and really work together to follow through on those plans. There are really some tense moments, and difficult decisions to make, once the evil power begins to escalate. This seems to have more replay value than its spiritual cousin, Lord of the Rings. Playing "in character" can be quite fun, but after a while it tends to bog the game down a bit. Excellent artwork and bits, in typical Days of Wonder fashion. This one was definitely worth the wait. Recommended!

The game is interesting but for me and my group.. lacking of variety.
I couldn't be able to specify exactly for what reason but my belief was the simply.. play one card and move on; It was rather removing the excitement of the play. Somehow it felt... restrained.

Probably i felt it simply repetitive. I do see why someone could like it but i prefer something with a higher choice of actions.

Had this game awhile, and like the components and the moves within the game.  The "player drop out" mechanism is just more of a "skip their turn without a lot of problems" mechanism... you could probably do the same thing in any coop game without a lot of issues (provided you didn't do it intentionally for an advantage).  We have quite enjoyed the game.

RATING: 6
I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  I thought the game was simply ok.  To be fair I thought the same of LotR when I first played it, but now like it a lot more (especially with 2).  Accusing the traitor before the last turn can be bad, as you give them a pretty brutal power to use over and over.  It still suffers from being almost impossible to find the right balance between being too open with what cards people have (making the game too easy and boring), and playing with no talking at all (making it too hard and boring).  Perhaps there should be a "price" paid for playing a card or trading a card with Arthur as the result of something someone said. I'd play it again if there wasn't something else going on that I wanted to play more, but I can't see myself requesting to play myself.  Gorgeous bits for sure.

My favorite cooperative that I've played - great theming (down to the "shadows" - impending doom is the dominant vibe with so many ways to lose piling up each turn), and the mechanics forestall any kind of "quarterbacking" phenomenon among the players.  

The traitor is also a great idea, even if it seems like adding insult to injury - even a semi-crafty traitor has a good chance of sinking everybody's chances, especially when the penalties for making false accusations are high.

Shadows over Camelot certainly isn't perfect, but it has lots of atmosphere and is a lot of fun. It also has a real sense of story, which many other games lack. The traitor aspect adds a lot to the game. Somewhat obsolete now due to the release of Battlestar Galactica, which improves upon the basic concept here. However, Shadows plays more quickly and is a more consistent experience than the more erratic BSG. When BSG is good, it's much better than Shadows. But BSG can also be much, much worse than the worst game of Shadows.

This game is very cool for the novelty and the great production value.  Unfortunately, the game play is lacking.  This is initially hidden behind a bunch of rules that don't add much depth.  I have played this game 3 times and my esteem of the game has gone down after each play.  I recommend playing it a few times for the novelty but I would not recomend buying it.  My last experience was so bad and tedious that I'll do my best at this point to suggest alternative games if this one is on the table.

After playing a 3-player game with no traitor it seemed a bit scripted and predictable but after the first game with a traitor the game got very tense and fun indeed.

Only played once. When you get into the game, you stand amazed and surprised how the well-conceived is this game; the figures and every detail of the appearence on the game (nothing strange in a Days of Wonder game) and also the game's mechanics. It's 3 hours of lot of concentration and fun.

RATING: 6
Once in awhile this is a great game to experience, if played correctly.  I am intentionally rationing myseld on this one to avoid burnout (and to avoid finding an optimal solution).  You need to do a bit of roleplaying to make this be its best, and you need to be a bit vague about your cards.  None of this "I need a really big card" nonsense either, that's just a code, keep it vague or this game is too easy.  Amazing bits.

RATING: 6
Only one play, but with 7 players it seemed like the game was a bit easy for the knights to win.  But winning isn't everything - trying to figure out who (if anybody) is the traitor is a lot of fun, and I think the co-op aspect works really well to help "gateway" some non-gamers into the hobby.

I was quite disappointed by this game as I thought it would be so much better. The graphics are stunning but playing the game is not. Feels like a watered down Lord of the Rings with the possibility of a Sauron character.

The traitor rule gains a point on its own, but it seems kind of out of place.  Like, they went and made a co-op Camelot game, and then some suit said "add some confrontation, this game blows" and so they tacked it on.  Galahad is suddenly evil and wants Camelot to fall?  What?  Seems out of place, but is the best rule.  Put a traitor rule in Arkham Horror, where it would fit.

RATING: 7
I think this probably the best co-operative game I've played.  It's not the kind of game you'd want to play all the time. But it generally gets some good discussion at the table.  Playing with a traitor is a must!  The paranoia and accusations at the table as to who is the traitor is the best part.  This beats out Lord of the Rings as it is more thematic, more replayable, and has better components.  I've yet to see the good guys lose, but the games have been close.  I wish I could draw the traitor...just once!  Heh.

RATING: 5
Players take on the roles of Knights of the Round Table, and try to navigate Camelot through a series of ongoing trials and tribulations.  Players take turns to first advance evil in some way (hurting Camelot), then doing some good deed to quash evil.  Evil is defeated by completing quests and repelling invasions - richly themed stuff boiled down to playing certain melds of cards on different areas of the game boards, and you really don't get a say there - you look at your hand and it tells you where to go.  Beautiful bits, but really a Lord of the Rings knock-off that is about half as good in terms of game play.  Great as a party/social game, but I'm not sure it was targeted there.  It gets played 3 or 4 times a year, mainly as a beer and pretzels game.

Ah, the traitor. After many discussions about and plays through this game, my friends and I have decided we cannot play this with each other anymore.

The box includes maps, playing cards, player aids, miniatures and few counters of fine quality.  Clear rules and innovative mechanics comprise an intriguing theme and fun interaction between players. The game competes against the players. For every move a player-knight takes there is a counter action from the game mechanics. So, the more players the better and more chances for success. Players are bound to defend the kingdom from Evil. In order to achieve this they have to complete quests like the search for relics, challenge the Black Knight, duel with Lancelot, participate in wars and lift the siege on Camelot. The knights united can easily beat any threat even when faced by bad luck and nasty coincidences or is there a traitor among them! Nice recreational time from Days of Wonder.

I enjoyed shadows.  I love the theme, and it was my first cooperative board game experience.  It is a little too easy though, unless you add a traitor in which case it becomes almost impossible.  I think we've had maybe two games where the traitor didn't end up winning regardless of who it was.

Medieval Arthurian goodness, with a hidden traitor....that actually can't do anything... The game is quite good until your group realizes that the traitor can do Sod all...any attempts for the traitor to sabotage anything will result in nothing happening or the traitor getting caught, while if they remain hidden the entire game they have a slight chance of winning.

On the Plus side its a good game to bring out for new people as they will enjoy it and not clock on how to beat the game....ohh and the pieces are lovely, specially if you paint them up.

I like cooperative games.  Even better a cooperative game with a potential traitor... ooh the intrigue.  I've enjoyed this game a number of times now, and with experienced players the good guys win a little too often, but throw in a few newbies and it's always a tense finish.  Perhaps Merlin's Company adds some difficulty.

I recommend Pandemic for those who like cooperative games that go down to the wire every time.

Okay co-operative game, but it feels a little "samey" the more you play it.  Fantastic looking game, and the traitor certainly helps the replayability somewhat, but I wonder if this game isn't a wee bit over-rated.  It's really just a glorified set-collection card game with a fancy board.   Excitement goes downhill rapidly the more you play it.

I like this game (loved it at first).  The cooperative part really gets people involved, and there is some good tension that makes the game fun.  The problem is, after you've played it a couple times, it's not any fun without the traitor.  And, it kinda sucks playing with someone new, because you almost dictate their moves. If you don't everyone will lose.

If you meet at least two of these conditions you MUST try this game at least once in your life:
1. Watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail
2. Enjoy playing co-op games (ex: Pandemic)
3. Interested in Arthurian Legend
4. Like to randomly accuse people of things
5. Enjoy getting into character when you play games

This is a great co-op (with traitor mechanic) that follows the Knights for the Round Table in multiple quests/adventures (ie: Holy Grail, Excalibur, Lancelot, Black Knight, Tournaments, Dragons, Saxon/Pict Wars). Give it a go if it at all seems interesting to you. It has gorgeous artwork and great miniatures to play with as well!

The mechanics of this game are very simple once you play through, but in the 3 player game we played, the game proved a good challenge.

I like CO-OP games since they are rare, and allow players who are always out to win to work in a group for a common goal. We did determine quickly exacly which quests we had to win and which we could lose ot still win the game (which changes the game play a bit although still good strategy in my mind) and did not play with a random "traitor" but still, it took a lot of cooperation and planning ahead with each player to ensure victory, the core of any good Co-OP game.

This is the only co-op game I've ever really liked.  The whole traitor thing made it a hoot to play as the paranoia tortured the whole group.  Even so, the game just didn't catch on with my groups, so it got traded.

Currenty ranking as my #3 game, Shadows over Camelot is a game unlike any other that I've played thanks to it's traitor mechanic.
Other than that, the game is filled with an inviting theme of Arthurian legend ,great player interaction and a challenging gameplay, one that you will probably loose if you don't work together to complete your quests and find the treacherous traitor that is secretly sabotaging the knights to gain victory for camelot.

Indeed S.o.C is a game that you'd want to bring back to the table again and again for you and your friends and family to enjoy.

The theme is irradiating from the box and you feel immerged in the time frame the game's in.

One aspect really positive is yours "acts of heroism" doing things in the behalf of the companions!

Shadows over Camelot has some comparisions with Reiner Knizia's Lord of the Rings co-op game. I am not quite sure which one I like best between the two. 

Beautiful artwork, theme and presentation. Not as fun as I first of thought. Mechanics needs some work. Hand management. More of a card game than a board game in my opinion. The board is just to show where you can go to, do there and what you get for your efforts. Replayability not as high as I would of thought.

**After playing Shadows over Camelot more, I prefer Lord of the Rings than Shadows over Camelot.**

Rating 7 down to a 5.

Update:

Replayed Shadows over Camelot. I enjoyed the game we played. We had lots of fun. Had a better feeling compared to the other games I played. Maybe it's because of the player's I played with.

A great "cooperative" game, perhaps the best.

An excellent feature is that players are not FORCED to actually cooperate, but if they don't, they will lose. The "traitor" feature is superb and really makes the game special.

The mechanics are fairly smooth except for the awkward way in which players are forced to describe cards without actually saying specifically what card they are talking about. I'm not sure what is gained by forcing a player say "I need strength - but not maximum strength...", or whatever, instead of just saying "I need a 4".

The "Bits" are absolutely first-rate and I also enjoy making all the obligitory Monty Python quotes.

So far I've found nothing to fault in this game. It's design creates a constant tension and you can feel the shadows closing in on Camelot as you work to align the Knights to stop the impending doom and also unmask the traitor. I suspect replay quality will be very high, especially if the traitor is used. The production quality is far and away one of the best I've ever seen in 40+ years of buying games. This game is almost underpriced at $49.95 and it will easily make my "money back guarantee" list.

Thus far, played one 2-player game. Didn't see the point with 2 players. I can see how there might be a game there with more players and a traitor, but I'm not entirely convinced. It seems like you'd mostly be playing against the system, not the other players. While I enjoy playing against some other systems - Roads and Boats, for example - this one seems too random for that.

Good.  Yes, it's ridiculously overproduced, and yes, making poker hands has absolutely nothing to do with Arthurian legend.  But it's generally fun.

Unfortunately for Shadows, it's been totally shown up by Battlestar Galactica.  It's kind of like those slam-dunk contests in the NBA ten years ago, where everyone claps at a nice-looking dunk or two, and then Michael Jordan shows up to let you know how it's supposed to be done.

Got this game just so my kids would have one that would force them to work together. In that regard it's a roaring success. Not only did they cooperate with each other (and me), but they laid down their characters lives in vain attempts to forestall the inevitable. It's been a while since I've found a game that will hold their attentions equally. Obviously, this plays easier with more — having the traitor in play with three is just deadly.

This game is really fun when accusations are encouraged!  Unfortunately, I've played a few times where people weren't really into the accusation game, and one player started telling everyone else what to do on their turn.

RATING: 4.5
Initially, a fun game to play, but as your play options are very limited (not a good sign for longevity) the game becomes mostly, processional . A turn is essentially draw (bad action) & play (good action), with each player's action being mostly obvious. Also, the game doesn't come to a natural conclusion, but requires the players to end it themselves in a very >forced horrible< rule book. I've dropped my rating from a 5 to a 4.5 as a result.

A co-op game from Days of Wonder. I liked it quite a bit when it first came out, but each couple of plays made me drop the rating another point. It just doesn't grab me like Lord of the Rings, which I feel has more tension (as well as a theme that works for me more than SoC). In LotR, I feel palpable tension, but in SoC, I feel like I'm just laying down poker hands.

Sadly, I want to give this game about an 8 or 8.5 but I can't.  The best part of the game is that it accommodates a 1-8 people and you can have a purely co-op game or one with a possible traitor.  There are a few things that hold it back for me the most effective strategy for the traitor is being openly traitorous and laying siege engines every round which is especially detrimental in a game with a low amount of players.  There seems to be a lack or things to do or I just find it to be repetitive.  It's fun but could have been so much more.

One of the best cooperative games out there, full of flair (although basically abstract, like Knizia's LOTR) and astonishingly quick to play. The traitor role works very well and adds to the excitement, and the cooperative element never gets too "cosy" or boring. The physical quality of the game components is great and the game is beautiful to behold. Could be easily expanded with more characters, quests, etc.. Recommended!

RATING: 6.5
Excellent pieces and a fantatstic theme in a gorgeous package.  But, although the game has a lot of tension and turns are quick, it really does bash you around each and every turn and sometimes your only option is simply to move!  Even without a traitor, this is tough game to win and usually requires player elimination (self-sacrifice) to complete the quests.  Usually I find Camelot falls and the end game is a bit repetitive with half the team fighting the besieging forces.  I think it works best at the 5-6 player level, but does require coordinated player interaction. Some knights are more powerful than others (i.e. essential), but I think the traitor has the easiest task (and is perhaps overpowered).  There is also a far bit of metagaming involved, where some quests you'll try and lose just to ensure 12 swords are obtained.  And maybe co-ops are not for me; it is tough, especially as the beseigers grow and fellow players make unwise plays.  Collectively we all lose (exc: traitor), else, maybe I'm not very good at this game. 

Although the self-sacrifice elimination works thematically in the game, I don't really like it and I find the idea a bit dated (you all still win collectively even if all the knights die but one, doesn't make sense to me) and so I don't believe Shadows would receive its acclaim if launched nowadays.  The traitor was a great original idea the designers came up with though.

I'll revisit this after playing Battestar Galactica and Dead of Winter (where killed players are reincarnated into new survivors) some more.

My favorite co-op game. However we don't pull it out when we want to play a co-op game, we pull it out when we want to play a 7 or 8 player game. In theory, the more players, the more down time. In practice, the more players, the merrier.

RATING: 7.5
Played twice and both games were highly enjoyable.  I won as the traitor in the first game and lost to the game in the second, so it's not an easy game to beat.  I successfully accused the traitor in the second game about 2/3 through, but post game discussions revolved around whether it's a good idea to out the traitor at all since they can take cards away from players, and even more damaging, place siege engines during their turns.  I read one article that suggests outing (assuming you know who it is) the traitor at the last moment to avoid the two black swords, which seems like a good idea.  What about as the traitor, coming out early on instead of hiding?  Can you do more damage after you're revealed placing sieges, or staying hidden (in order to stay hidden, you have to play pretty darn efficiently pretending to be a loyal player, and this only helps the loyalists)?  Regardless, this is a great game of camaraderie.

RATING: 6
A classic design of a mostly-cooperative Euro. The saboteur is a gaming mechanic that is still hot, and it's clear that the originator of the coop traitor nailed it. Kudos also go out to Days of Wonder for an amazing job making this prototype into a stunning production. It's a beautiful game. Even 5 years after its initial printing, the game still has a presentation that would be considered top notch today. 

SoC gets a 6 from me because of the group-dependence of the title. With the right group, this game is a blast, but in contrast, this style of game could be ruined by a different atmosphere. Still, this design demands to be respected.

[8 plays] This is fabulous and has become my favorite cooperative game.  I think it holds up well to repeated play, and seems to have enough diverse aspects that it isn't likely to feel like the same thing over and over.  And it has a very successful cooperative spirit, with the whole group working together to figure out who should deal with which of the many threats next, and a great thematic sense of impending doom.  Good level of difficulty--it's challenging to win, but not impossible.  It's also a beautiful game.

No he jugado muchas veces pero las 3 ó 4 veces que lo he hecho me ha parecido un tostón.De lo mejor que tiene el juego es la presencia del traidor, cuando eres el traidor (yo nunca lo fui y quizá por eso no vi la gracia del juego) debe ser más divertido.Se trata de un juego cooperativo (todos contra el tablero), pero es tan dificil ganar que aunque el traidor no se descubra y juegue a favor de los Caballeros de Arturo es casi imposible ganar. Nosotros nunca lo hicimos.Hay muuuuuuuuchos juegos a los que antes jugaría, aunque no descarto darle alguna otra oportunidad porque no puede ser tan malo

Too lengthy for what it is, a rebadged and simplified (!) rummy. The cooperative aspects are a sham (it might as well be solitaire with multiple hands) and the traitor mechanic is weak (be subtle and only affect close games or be bold and be found out immediately). 

I suppose if the paper-thin theme really excites you, you might get some dividends on what you put in, but there are much better co-op games out there (e.g., Battlestar Galactica).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One of the better co-ops, certainly in artwork and theme. Several ways to go about winning and the game is definitely a challenge. Probably only won once or twice out of 7-8 plays. This handles up to 7 people which is great but like a lot of co-ops it can suffer from one player making most of the decisions, esp if they have played before. If you can find the right group this is a good one.

RATING: 7
(As of [b]6[/b] plays) Not as fine-tuned a cooperative experience as [GAMEID=30549], nor as thrilling a traitor experience as [GAMEID=37111]. However, the gorgeous components and popular theme make it a decent, if not stellar, addition to the co-op/traitor genre. Even more fun if your group gets into the spirit and insists on saying "prithee!" a lot when playing it.

Cooperative game with attractive theme, high production quality, and very accessible for new gamers.  Very high fun factor and tension, especially towards the end!  The cooperative aspect works well, and results in a strong social component.  This game has produced some of my most fun gaming experiences ever. Having a "traitor" makes the game especially interesting, and adds a complete other dimension to the game.  

Some claim it is not ideal for consistent repeated play, except with different groups, but it has to be admitted that it is a great gateway type game and very accessible.  See this review for who will find Shadows Over Camelot appealing: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/168987

Miniatures can be painted to improve it.  I have painted all my minis - here they are still in progress:

For those looking for a more serious gamers game with cooperative play with a higher replay value and deeper gameplay, Lord of the Rings is arguably a better choice.

If I'd never found BGG and was stuck playing Settlers of Catan and Shadows Over Camelot, I wonder how long I'd last? In any case, SoC is a game like Settlers that was very fun for a while before I knew any better. Once I found better games, I moved on from each of them. In SoC's case, it was, of course, BattleStar Galactica. Playing the traitor in SoC is not nearly as interesting as it should be. You can't do much while concealed without being obvious, so you basically just play along until you decide it's best to reveal and start placing siege engines. Not the most interesting of positions. 

Otherwise, I enjoyed the cooperative aspect of the game as SoC was the most sophisticated coop I had encountered up to that point. BSG improves on the design by leaps and bounds to the point where I'd steer people that way and away from this one. Fun for a brief period, but this one's been obsoleted.

I love, love, love:
- the tension of the push and pull between good and evil
- that the quests are pretty varied in their requirements for success and their bonuses for winning vs penalties for losing each one
- the option of a traitor, but why the heck would King Arthur possibly turn on himself/his kingdom?
- the paintable minis

I dislike:
- the Poker-style mini-games--could've been more creative for sure
- that some of the evil cards are severely punishing

Final verdict: Not a bad game, but it's not for us. Up for trade.

Mechanically and timing-wise not very different from Knizia's Lord of the Rings.  Definitely plays quite fast, though the role-playing element can make it bog down considerably.

Easier to play than LOTR, and easier to get people to play. The constant state of suspicion just adds a wonderful element, and DoW outdid themselves with the quality of components.

I have played SoC only once.  It was at times tense and exciting, but my own character's involvement felt rather superfluous, dull and repetitive. SoC supposedly plays best with more players, but it really seemed to drag when we played it with 7.  It took forever for my turn come up, which was then a quick, almost pointless activity, followed by more waiting.

I should probably give SoC another chance, but I find myself avoiding it when faced with other more desireable choices.

Awesome theme and interesting game play with each knight bouncing round the board attempting 'quests' which require different card combinations.... unfortunatly the game isn't quite there for me, doesn't inspire me and make be want to play it.

There is a hidden traitor aspect, but not all that much that the traitor can do that will result in either a) them staying hidden or b) affecting the game negatively.

The game appears difficult enough without the addition of this traitor, but perhaps this was simple due to a bad shuffle.

I like that a 'bad' thing happens at the beginning of every turn however once the grail/excalibur are claimed/lost them pretty much everything adds siege engines to the board and the game becomes a complete slog.

I much prefer battlestar galactica to this for a satisfying hidden traitor game

(Language dependent - get a copy in your language). I was surprised at how well this game worked, and how much fun it was. Once you get past the rules reading, which did take a while, the game itself moves quickly. The Progression Of Evil was nicely balanced, the inevitable build-up of enemies at the gate caught me out. I was expecting a much easier ride. Our traitor lead us to a terrible defeat (you treacharous bastard Mike!), and the whole mechanisms of quests, swords, life points, accusations, siege engines all worked very smoothly. Some slight quibble of the Special Powers being a little imbalanced, but the team aspect was good and you were not forced to do as others suggested. I put this co-operative experience much higher than the Knizia LOTR, which to me seemed like a solitaire game played by several. In Shadows Over Camelot, you really have to work as a team, knowing there is a possible viper in your midst. I strongly recommend this game. The cards and rules explainations make the game heavily language dependent, and I'd set a good 3 hours aside for playing, but get this one under your belt, it's another winner from DoW.

I feel like I've played this enough times to feel like I've seen most of the general patterns of play, and that's after less than a dozen games!  I guess that this game is a little bit more balanced than the Lord of the Rings co-op, but at 0 vs 3 expansions, it feels a lot smaller, too.  This is a cool game, but I am pretty well tired of it for a while.

We had loads of fun playing this the first few games, and still do in fact.  But I don't want to break it out very often.  It took us a while to get good enough to beat it, and now that we finally did, we will start using the traitor.  I want to spread this one out to keep it interesting, but I'd usually rather pull out a different game.  Definetely need the right group in the right mood.

Loved this one at first because I like the concept of the hidden traitor.  However, there just isn't enough secrecy/ambiguity for the traitor to do much damage undetected, either he is obvious and gets called out, or he doesn't do any damage and has little to no impact on the game.  Perhaps this would be different if we could stick to a strict 'no talking specifics' rule but that is hard to do in a co-op.

The ultimate in team games, DO NOT play this without the traitor.  The possibility of the traitor is what makes this game.  Otherwise, it is just an exercise.  Like Werewolf, and Diplomacy, this is a social game, and convincing others to do what you want them to do is the meat of the game.

Played 5+ times. Being that this is a high-profile co-op board game, it is inevitable that it will be compared to the only other game of that type, Reiner Knizia's Lord of the Rings. The first thing I'd compare is complexity. Lord of the Rings has a fair number of little rules to remember, and so does SOC, but Shadows is just a bit easier to get the swing of and is easier to set up. LOTR tends to force the players to work closely together (which I like) while SOC allows players to do pretty much whatever they feel like doing, independant of the other players (which can also be nice) but which renders SOC less sociable and interactive. Don't get me wrong, some co-op is still needed in SOC, but not as much! Both games are good, but I feel I should address the "hype". A lot of people say SOC is much better than LOTR which I can't quite fathom. They are both interesting and unique pieces of game design, each with different strengths, but to say SOC leaves LOTR in the dust is a bit of a disservice to the gaming community. I find them nearly equal in appeal, with LOTR being more of a team game and having greater intensity, but SOC scales to higher numbers well, and is a bit easier to grasp and quicker to setup and play. After 5 playings, I believe that the short-term replayability of SOC is actually quite poor, with virtually no long-term replayability -- it is not as replayable as LOTR if you have the expansions for LOTR, and even base-game to base game, it can't compete with Lord of the Rings.

RATING: 7.2
Not only was this one of the first Euro-type games (meaning not Clue) that I played, but it was the first co-op game I had ever played.  Everyone just told me what to do, and I did it, without really understanding what was going on.  I still liked it a lot.

After a 4 year break, I played it again tonight--ever so much better than I remembered.  In the last few years I have played some really excellent co-op games (Pandemic, Space Alert, Red November, Last Night on Earth, Ghost Stories, or a 5-player Fury of Dracula)and this one ranks right up there.  A really good co-op game--especially with the Traitor and the max number of people. 

On Bruno Faidutti's Best Games List.

Edit: After playing a dozen games, we never cease to have fun, always centered around who is the traitor if any.  It is really an inspiration in the game that perhaps there might not even be one.

Challenging and engaging.  If the players can manage to keep quiet and not share information too openly, the game offers lots of drama and tension.

The first time I played this, I was just getting into gaming and had yet to be bitten by the co-op bug, so I found it pretty underwhelming. I had the opportunity to play a couple more times a few years later (after having played Battlestar Galactica, Arkham Horror, Pandemic, Lord Of The Rings and others), and was surprised at how much more I enjoyed it. It became one of my wife's favorite games, and now it's in our collection. Looking forward to many future plays.

[Hand Management, Set Collection, Cooperative, Werewolf Ripoff] [6P:4/3] One play, rating is leaning towards a 4. Maybe a 3. Depends on how bored I get next time around. Days of Wonder strikes with yet another beautifully produced shallow game. This is a card game with a superfluous (albeit beautiful) board. The playing of poker hands has no place in the Arthurian theme and thoroughly invalidates the entire atmosphere and feel of the game. What, too lazy to reconcile the mechanism to the theme? Inexcusable lack of attention to detail in terms of design. At the moment I don't see the replayability problem; I however do see a general weakness in terms of the overall design of the game. Likely will be a 3; Shadows over Camelot has no business being mentioned in the same sentence as Knizia's Lord of the Rings. ***UPDATE: Confirmed. This is a 3. Have found that Shadows over Camelot is even useless as a gateway game because newbies don't know what the heck to do when they get the Traitor card. Pass on this and get Lord of the Rings, it's a vastly superior game.

You have to play this in the right spirit - doesn't do the cooperative thing as well as LOTR as there is a sameness to the threats (so individual play can be quite mechanically repetitive) and a less obvious tale to follow.  Thus I still question the longer term replayability but in all honesty there are enough games out there that should never be an issue

Boring. If you are the revealed traitor double boring, you get to steal one random card from someone.

Providing an entire different gaming experience, this title is mandatory in any medium size game collection.
There is great fun and sometimes some tension when partners disagree on the right strategy. The traitor factor is quite smart, keeping everyones eyes well open and alert throughout the game (accusations and false accusations are produced in abundance...)
Despite the clever gaming mechanism , the strong theme and the fantastic quality of the components, at the end you felt just having fought the game and not your partners. This element alone discourages more plays, as my gaming friends like to know who's the best at all times.

Avoid like the plague. The concept is great, but two big flaws destroy it. First, it is almost impossible to win. You MUST have a certain strategy to have at least a chance and then it is too easy to find the traitor. Secondly, after the traitor have been exposed, there is no reduction of the harm he can do, making it unneccesary to expose him.

Lovagos pandemic. Najó, szerencsére nem, csak ettől féltem egy kicsit. Tisztán coop módban játszva is más, mint a pandemic és ez jó. Gyönyörű a kivitelezés, hangulatos a játék. Nagyon könnyed a játékmenet, ez különösen a túlbonyolított szabály elolvasása után volt meglepő. Nem gondoltam volna, hogy egy 30+ oldalas szabállyal megáldott játékra azt fogom mondani, hogy gyakorlatilag bárki le tud ülni mellé, de ebben az esetben tényleg így van. Külön jó pont a ki és beülési lehetőség, bár nem, tudom hogy fogjuk-e valaha alkalmazni.
Egyelőre csak coop módban próbáltuk. Úgy is szórakoztató volt, de azért érezhető, hogy hamar ki lehet ismerni a játékot, és nehézségi szintek hiányában így valószínűleg nem tud hosszútávú szórakozást nyújtani. Mindenképp ki kell próbálni árulóval is, mert úgy csilloghat csak igazán.
7.5

Kipróbáltuk jó sokan árulóval. Jó kis játék ez. Elég pörgős nagy társaságoknak is. Elég egyszerű, hogy bárkinek meg lehessen tanítani és végig szórakoztató.

This is probably one of the most unique games I own. All players are working to defeat the board game itself! It's great with a medium sized group of 4-5. The addition of a traitor is also a lot of fun. There is nothing like making an accusation to find out you just screwed the whole team! Awesome fun, and always a party favorite. If you like the genre of knights and old English tales this is a must.

Shadows over Camelot can offer quite a bit of tension - if you take it as a story-driven experience. Unfortunately, there is little assistance from the game on this as the main mechanism is a fairly dull card collection exercise, so it becomes exceedingly group dependent.
It shares some similarities with the cooperative Lord of the Rings board game but that one runs in a fraction of the time. There is of course no traitor in LotR which is an important (yet optional) part of SoC but then again Battlestar Galactico deals with that in more interesting ways, while the treason in SoC feels very mundane and unexciting. SoC is a somewhat simpler system but still takes a good while to complete which relegates it to a rather small niche in spite of its good looks.

I have played this twice now. the first time long before I had an account on BGG (as with many other sessions not listed here). That first game had no traitors. We won. It was playable, but we agreed it needed more attention to judge the game. Recently, the 2nd game we played did have the potential for a traitor. It turned out we didn't have one, but the added tension was still nice. The problem was that to end the game and 'win' we discovered it was easier to sabotage ourselves to pull off the win. This severely yanked us out of the theme/spirit of the game.

Meh.  Everything that Battlestar Galactica does right, this one does in a shallow, less interesting way.  There is not much a traitor can do with getting caught (in fact it is probably better for the traitor just to reveal and place siege engines anyways).  The tasks themselves are pretty lame.  The production is fantastic, but the game just doesn't hold up.

CONTRAS:
-Tras jugar unas cuantas partidas, se descubren trayectos a seguir y lugares a los que no compensa ir, lo que provoca repetitividad
-Con el traidor y más de 5 jugadores es extremadamente difícil ganar
-Al no haber edición en español, es necesario tener a mano traducciones de las cartas con texto para los jugadores que no dominen el inglés

I still have not made up my mind about this game. My game group went crazy over it when first released. We played it 5 times in 2 days. They wanted to play it more. My hesitancy was whether or not we had finally "solved" it. The first 3 games were blowouts - the Shadows and its treacerous Knight overpowering Arthur's loyal Knights. However, the last two were blowouts with the White Knights blowing out the traitor, 11-1; 9-3. In both cases the Traitor was revealed. Now that we know how to win easily as the Knights, we have to develop a "Traitor" strategy. Perhaps the game will have staying power. I sure hope so. The interaction is fantastically good. Now if only the game will prove to be a tough enough competitor.

Well - it's a year later and it has lost lots of its luster with me. I find it still challenging, but not half as fun. Mainly, I don't like cooperative games. I find it's more of a cooperative puzzle than competition. I love to compete and "win" a game. And when I win, I want it to be against a living, breathing person, not a system. Nevertheless, it's still not a bad game. AND, the ladies in our group have recently fallen in love with it and are playing it 2-3 times a week! They beat it last night with 7 players and NO traitor. I'm still ambivilant toward it. I don't mind playing it, but it's not in my top 10 list.

Wonder about longevity, especially within the same group....we will see after more playings.  Have dropped rating from 9 to 8 after three playings.

EDIT:  Played this again where I didn't get stuck on the grail quest--MUCH more enjoyable.  I hate the Grail quest!  You feel much more like you're participating in the game when you're helping with lots of different things.  Bumping rating up, I have a newfound liking for the game again.

Have only played a few games with two plays controlling 2 characters, but I like what I see, and intend to play it properly in a like-minded group when I get the chance (18/12/08 Rating 7).  Update: Played with 5 players and a traitor, and a good time had - increase rating to 8 on this basis (I would like to play it again) (2/7/11) UPDATE: another play, and it seems this game is no longer the attraction. The silly process of completing quests earlier but still needing 12 cards makes it possible to win by having to lose the knight quest before the last catapults arrive makes it a hollow thematic win. And It's not much fun for newbies to be Sir Kay. Rating drop to 5 as unlikely to play again for a long while (Aug 2013).

I think BSG is my go-to game for this type of game. Often, I felt like the game was playing us without much involvement from the players. Turns go by quick, so it actually works fine with 7 players, but several turns went by where I was just being screwed by the game and with no ability to prevent it.  So a little too much randomness for my likes. But still, a fun game, with nice DoW chunky bits and fast turns. I would play again.

This game is really good but can be difficult for the Good side to win. I love the tension that the players feel between balancing resources, co-operating with each other (not knowing if there is a traitor and, if so, who it is), and the constant Progression of Evil that needs to be mitigated. This game has a really great theme and some cool game mechanics. I like playing with 7 players (or with 8, using the expansion).

The components are spectacular. Often a very tense game, and really quite easy to learn. Loses half a point because it doesn't keep me thinking, so down-time can be a problem.

A great game overall, and far superior to Lord of the Rings (it's closest sibling). The cooperative aspect works fantastically due to the fact that danger comes from so many angles at once, forcing the players to divide their efforts.

RATING: 7
Shadows over Camelot is a game that entirely depends on the those playing.  it offers a cooperative gaming experience with a rich theme.  There are flaws in Camelot which can be fatal to the design, but most happen with lackluster play leading into too much card information shared between players.  If players are willing to "play" along then Shadows can really be a wonderful gaming experience, and just slightly behing LotR for cooperative play.  The addition of a posible traitor makes all games a little more tense, as suspicious eyes roam the table and false accusations come with heavy cost.  Critics will pan this game for basically being play cards on tasks repeat.  However, the assurance that with each black event draw the ongoing tasks will get harder and some will need attention more than others actually leads to some interesting decisions within the group.

Siege engines are a$$holes.

4 plays (3, 4 & 5 palyers) in and it runs a dream - everyone who has played it has loved it. The look, feel and blending of game to background is tip-top. The game balance works brilliantly... which I was surprised by. Feeling you have to do 10 things at once to survive.
The components support the gameplay well... so there is no need to refer to the rules.
I feel one or two weaknesses will creep in as it is played more - like most games, but that is what "house rules" are for.

RATING: 6
Fun game, however the bulk of the fun comes not from the mechanics of play, but from the behavior and interaction of the players.  The description: "Werewolf with a board" is most apt.  This game would be boring without the possibility of a traitor. This is another "experience the theme" type game... best with the group who are in the mood for play-acting and imagining.  Way too long for what it is... I traded it away.  Knizia's LoTR is the better choice if you are looking for a cooperative.

Holy sweet mother, what a compelling, different game we have here!  Unlike other games in my collection, it's collaborative - with a twist.  Has elements of Fury of Dracula in that people work together against a "bad guy", but in this game, you don't know the identity of the traitor.  In fact, you don't know at all if there is a traitor.  The neverending feeling of impending doom makes for a great atmosphere.  I wonder, though, if this game is possible to win.  Only played once - let's see if it ages well!

Starting to wonder what it will take to win at this game.  Last game, the win felt like it was in the bag, but at the last moment, the siege engines overran us. 

Feels like the only way to win is as the traitor!

I'm definitely getting a little tired of this game.  Too many plays too quickly!

The longer I am away from this game, the greater my urge is to play it.

a nice questing like coop(or semi coop with a variant) game based on the classic king Arthur letterature. players are honourable and skilled knight(the famous ones from the legends)with eventually king Arthur himself, who tries to repell all sort of invaders and famous villains and enemies of Camelot avoiding the destruction of the court and the reign. this game features a card sistem that represents the military forces that follows the knights or their own strenghts. a very good game for 3 to 7 players

WOW! Is all I can say.  Fun, exciting, and mildly stressful.  Time flew by.  For me it was the hit of Gencon2006.  Borrowed a copy for a few weeks over Christmas break and it was a good time. I introduced this to my wife, some friends and our kids (no traitor.)  Wife still does not enjoy it as much as others have.  Her primary complaint is "there is too much going on at once."  I think everyone else had a great time and said they wished to play it again.  I let everyone work out their own turn but this game did have moments of collective analysis paralysis.  Lots of interesting (hard) lessons to be learned by adolescents (or anyone for that matter): being prepared, sharing, picking your battles, sacrifice, teamwork and synergy as survival traits.
Update: After a year this game, it is wearing a bit thin.  With seven it is taking forever with experienced players.  Near the end the "bossyness" in some players comes out, and the traitor is always the slowest of all players.  The last few of games have been unrewarding.  Perhaps it is a fun game to learn... but not play... does that make sense? It is now on my wife's refuse to play list; her complaint now is that "it really doesn't feel like a game."

Juego semicooperativo -es decir, cooperativo con traidor- que ha sido superado por títulos posteriores, como Galáctica. Sin embargo, le sigo teniendo aprecio y disfruto jugándolo. Quizás sea por la atractiva temática de las leyendas artúricas y por su cuidadísimo aspecto gráfico.

Las mecánicas del juego son sencillas y funcionan perfectamente. Ganar no es demasiado complicado si los jugadores usan la cabeza (hay reglas para endurecer la dificultad). El papel del traidor es importante, pero lo cierto es que en este juego tiene menos margen de maniobra que en otros, por lo que su influencia en el resultado final se verá algo limitada.

I don't think the systems of the game are brilliant, and I'm not in love with it.   But I like that people can slip in and out of the game if need be and it doesn't ruin it, and that people don't end up with hurt feelings and are betrayed.

Shadows Over Camelot is a beautifully produced game with an attractive theme. My husband and I love many cooperative games, but we just don't like how this one feels while we are playing it. Because a black card is drawn every turn and can apply to any of six different quests, we feel like we are always in the wrong place and have the wrong white cards. We don't like the feeling  of falling further and further behind with every turn. I am rating the game a 6 because I recognize the good qualities of the design; it's just not for us.

One of my favorite games. Co-opertave (sometimes) play, trying to finger who's the traitor, and simple game mechanics make this one a delight to play. Not only does it look great, but it's fun, engaging, with very little down-time, as player's need to work as a team.

Not fan of the traitor mechanics, and it seems it's much more powerful not to hide too much as being discovered really makes the game harder for loyal players (basic strategy of siege machines each turn seems very efficient).

The best co-op game out there!  Amazing.  After quite a few more plays, I have found that the game can get too easy.  Playing with a bunch of experienced players we definately win way more often then we loose, even with a Traitor.

RATING: 4
The first half of my first game approached the margins of "entertaining," but I will actively avoid a second game.  Especially when we could play the masterful Lord of the Rings instead.  There are simply too few meaningful choices, and too little variety in the decisionmaking.  You travel to a quest and then spend several turns mindlessly cranking away, laying down the required cards.  Progress is so sluggish and incremental that players are more likely to feel mild malaise than tense excitement.  The lavish Days of Wonder production is not enough to win my affection.

Rating is after 1 play-- and the traitor wasn't in the game, as it turned out. Lovely bits, nice balanced mechanics, some good tension. But it doesn't feel like *I*'m playing the game-- decisions are group decisions, and it's lots of play a card, wait, play another card. Will play some more-- probably having a traitor would add a lot.

RATING: 5
It is an okay co-op game, but the (secret) traitor mechanic is somewhat weak.  It really has a small window for optimal players at 5-6, any more and the traitor doesn't matter, any less and the traitor doesn't even need to disguise his intentions.

Love the theme.  Captures the round table myhtology of Arthur Pendragon beautifully.  Mechanics are smooth and easy to understand.  Seemed a bit too restrictive in what you could do at times eg you move to a quest - felt like a bit of a waste of a move.  Apart from that a truly inspired game.

Co-op games with a potential traitor are generally better than those without. But the basic turn mechanics of SoC are just so boring. Good for a couple of plays, but too many in a short period of time will feel very samey.

RATING: 6.5
Only one play in so far - a fairly strategy light game, but the social aspect, both in terms of cooperation and the threat of a traitor add some fun. It adds a gap in my collection, but the lack of in-depth strategy makes it lose some points in my rating.

RATING: 6.5
An "experience game" that I trot out a couple times a year. I don't think it will stand up to repeated plays -- already some optimum paths are emerging, after only a contest or two -- but the point of the game (as I see it) is to be slightly drunk and have a light role playing experience with an Arthurian theme. And in that the game succeeds on all counts.

RATING: 5.5
This is a fun coopertive game in the same mode as LoTR.  However, I never feel like I'm enjoying the game as much as I should be.  One of the frustrating things is to have to spend a turn moving to/from a quest.  When I've already sat through a number of other people's turns, it's frustrating to do so little on my own turn and then have to wait again.  In LoTR communication is encouraged, so I usually feel like I'm a part of anyone's turn, Shadows has a vaguely defined limit on table talk, so I don't feel anywhere near as engaged.
I haven't played with more than 4 players, or with a traitor, so perhaps my rating would increase if/when that happens.

Wow - I've only played this a few times, but I anticipate this being a long-time favorite. Easy gameplay, beautiful decision making and an amazing twist with the Traitor. Just one of the best games I've played. Beautiful board/bits - nothing to dislike about this game. [A year + later] I've played this quite a bit, and still enjoy it very much, but am slightly less enthusiastic about it now. With the group I play with there's a certain formula we use that either works (when there's no traitor) or doesn't (when there is). That's taken some of the fun out of it... still a quality game though.

Shadows over Camelot is more about socializing, communication and cooperation than a game. With the right group this can be a fun waste of time but may be also very unsatisfying. The quests are ridiculous because of being Poker tasks like having a pair/triplet/flush. When did they play Poker on Camelot?
Revealing the traitor to early in the game does the knights prone to lose.

This game is suffering on it's replayability.  If I don't play with the loyatlies, forget it, I won't play at all.  I think that the questionning over the "is there a traitor" is a necessary addition to the game.

I'll play every now and then but it's definitely not my first choice!

By the way, my rating went from 9 to 7 after playing alot of games...  it's definitely a good game, but don't play it too often!

This game as far as I know was one of if not the first game to implement a solid hidden traitor role in a board game. The game is easy to play but the decisions can be mind bending.

At one time this was the best co-op game in my collection. It has been surpassed by Arkham Horror, Pandemic, Red November, and Ghost Stories.

Without doubt the most unusual and innovative game I have played this year.
I usually dislike cooperative games, but thanks to the traitor rule does this game raise itself above others in the genre: you need all the help you can get to fight off evil. But who can you trust? You know that there can only be one traitor - so how come they all behave suspiciously?

RATING: 8
A game where you really have to work hard to win.  Just as you think you're getting on top of things the traitor pops up and ruins all your well laid plans.  We won this once, and now when I look back at it I think maybe we got a rule wrong, and probably should have lost, which makes me want to play it again and do it right, but I know the traitor would ruin it for me, so I don't.

RATING: 6
Pay no heed to the naysayers - unless you're an absolute balance fanatic or a scoring freak, or otherwise cannot stomach the very thought of cooperative games, this game is a joy to play with a proper group. However, playing without the possibility of a traitor takes practically everything away from the game, so don't do it, it's truly a waste. 

Update: after going for a few of months without playing (we played it intensively for awhile), we decided to take this out for a go, just the other day. Surprisingly, I found the game dry and repetitive. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood. I've since played it another couple of times, and was left with the same impression. It seems odd that my opinion would change so drastically, but it did. Knocked back a full 2 points.

Had a great first play.  It was fun trying to help with quests.  I like Coops anyway, but trying to feret out the Traitor was a tense little twist.  We finally got to just before end of game leaving us only one black sword at end.  Love to get a copy for my group some day.  

The game was pretty, not oversized, so it doesn't need a massive table.  The figures were all very well sculpted.  I also liked the individual player powers for even more flavor.

I do like a good semi-co-op and this is a good one!  I especially enjoy the drop in/out mechanism.  I also enjoy getting to be in character and not refer to the cards!  "Say, Sir Lancelot, do you have a strong army you might want to come and help me take out the Picts with??"

RATING: 7
Very cool game, and not nearly as complicated as I thought it was going to be.  The gameplay is simple, yet there is a lot to take into consideration.  The game is more random than I would normally like, but it all evens out because you're playing cooperatively and MUST work together anyway.  The element of a potential traitor in the midst is what makes the game great, and it's done very well, though the game mostly sucks if there's no traitor... I recommend dropping a card or two to guarantee that there is one.  It's one of the best-looking games I've seen as well.

I know there are shortcomings to this game, but my 15-year-old has enjoyed it with his friends, and our entire family has enjoyed it together. At one time, we set up a table with castles, miniature knights and other pieces in an attempt to emulate the great game board in the photos on this site.  We decided we didn't need the extras to enjoy the game, but we'll probably do it again.

After more plays, I've decided I only like it okay. The replay value isn't as strong as I originally thought. The mechanic of requiring each player to perform one bad and one good action every turn is fantastic. It makes it easy to suspect and distrust any player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I agree with comments saying this is a card game played with a board rather than a board game but that is neither here nor there in my opinion. I love the theme and I love the miniaturess you get in the game. Certainly it's visually stunning. I can see how people are commenting that it lacks replayability and can get repetitive but for me that's probably not an issue as I only play games twice a week and have a vast array available so it's not likely I'll be overplaying any one game at all.

I do like cooperative games and as mentioned I love the theme so this one is a winner with me. It doesn't require huge amounts of thought as your best course of action is usually fairly obvious from the cards in your hand but that suits my usually gaming group who are more into games that are either thematic and visual or fairly simple.

This is a very tough co-op game.  I think the traitor mechanic is almost unnecessary since the game is tough enough without someone trying to sabotage the whole thing.

This was a relatively fun game without all that much strategy or thinking involved. It was an easy way to pass the time, and although it's quite complicated, in retrospect, I'm sure it'd be easy to teach to new players. (We played 5 players, and although one guy had read the rules, nobody had played before.) I did like the fact that everyone sort of plays against the game, and not really against each other, except that I drew the traitor card, and was consequently the only one to lose. hehe.

RATING: 9
This game ticks a lot of boxes for me... It's semi-co-operative, with a traitor mechanism (a la [gameid=9220], only in a much more lavish game). The Arthurian theme is really good, and opens the door to lots of fun with quotes from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. 
The overall mechanism is pretty straightforward card play, using ideas taken from poker and the like, however the black and white cards are an excellent idea, as is the idea of balancing bad and good actions each turn.
There is also the whole metagame of working out who is the traitor, with plenty of table talk encouraged.

Have played this over 20 times now... occasionally with 3 or 4 players and no traitor, but more often with up to 7 players (and 8 sometimes with the Merlin expansion)... and it is an incredible game.


I actually bought the set of painted knights from Days of Wonder before Christmas (2005), hoping to get the game either for Christmas, or purchase it afterwards... Actually got 2 copies for Christmas, though my brother exchanged his one for Railroad Tycoon.

Really nice components, especially when painted, but : Played twice, and bored to death both times. Use one card from your hand, then turn over an enemy story card. Repeat over and over again. 
We thought the traitor would make the game more interesting, but you are not allowed to act the best ways to win as traitor, because the rules and designers think that would be destrucive game play :) Instead you have to be nice to your opponents and not block the most valuable positions. 
Even worth is the idea to include roleplaying style. You are not to ask for a number 2 card. Instead you ask for a weak army, or a very weak army if you need a number 1 card. Guess what: 3 is a medium army, and 4 and 5 are (very) strong cards :) And the rules tell you to talk like a noble knight.
Age should be 10- (minus not plus) or 12- a great game for little kids, that love playing knights.

I've only played SoC twice, and those plays were back to back or nearly so. It's cooperative, which is a strike against it in my book, but if there is a Traitor in the game that brings it up in my estimation. I doubt I'll ever feel a need to own this one though.

This has had replay over years at game gatherings at our house. The "hidden traitor" mechanic makes it a hit with (at least) the early teen crowd. And the challenge of winning makes it replayable over and over.

The most enjoyable aspect of the game seems to be characters and the roles. That may be down to the kind of friends my kids bring over, but it's a definite draw.

The only down side to this is that the girls who come over do feel left out because the only ladies in the game are either evil or very tangential. I'm not arguing for the sort of changes that Peter Jackson made to LotR to be "up to date" with modern audiences --- heaven forbid! But it is a factor in gameplay enjoyment.

A terrific cooperative game. Heck, the last time I played this I started off by going on a Holy Grail quest and ended up getting bogged down there for the whole game until finally beating it... So for the whole game I really had very little to do... And yet, I still really enjoyed being part of the game and was totally invested in it. I love the concept of the possibility (but not surety) of there being a traitor and the idea of racing/fighting against the game itself in order to win.

A bit disappointed with this one. You spend several goes in one spot laying cards from your hand and then get trshed anyway! Not much skill involved there... Co-op (aside from having the same goals) seems to amount to swapping a few cards. Fun for the family but not much more serious than that.

The game is beautifully produced, but in essence it is a card game in disguise, as the various boards only serve to provide some info on the quests and placeholders for the cards. Player actions are very simple, and there is a number of decisions on which quests to pursue, which evil to suffer or when to use the Merlin cards. However, the gameplay is too abstract to be engaging, and it never feels very strategic or deep. Most of the time, the players' hands or special powers set the best course of action. It's mildly fun to try to figure out who might be the traitor, but the probability of having one at the table is the only thing that scales with the number of players, causing the difficulty level to vary from game to game.

This is a great way to introduce players to the concepts at play in cooperative board games.  An average game is about half the length of Battlestar Galactica.  Also, Shadows over Camelot is less complex than Battlestar Galactica, which you can always introduce to players later.

Don't get me wrong -- I like Battlestar even better, but Shadows over Camelot is a great place to start.

A játék gyönyörüü.

Globálisan jónak és szórakoztatónak találtam a játékot egy parti után. De ehhez kellett a megfelel%u0151 társaság is.

Viszont bizonyos küldetések végrehajtása nem feltétlenül nagy élmény. Pl kezemben volt 4 lap Lancelot ellen, 1-2 köröm azzal telt el, hogy megszerezzem az ötödiket, utána teljes fegyverzetben kivonultam a hídhoz, s evvel együtt ugyi 7 fordulóm ment el a vele való "küzdelemmel". Az én quest-em nem volt nagy élmény.
Persze kedves árulónk még nálam is rosszabbul érezte magát. Hat lovag ellenében kellett volna cselekednie.

Várom a next partit.

Disappointing. The miniatures, thick cardboard and good artwork can't hide the tepid, tedious gameplay.  What could have been an epic adventure-style game is instead a dull exercise in set collecting.

This game is especially bad for the traitor.

A much more in-depth version of Avalon in some respects.  Arthur and his knights are fighting the armies of Mordred in order to save the Kingdom of Camelot but yet again, one of the knights has turned traitor and seeks to scupper the plans of the heroes.

A good game for teamwork and getting to know your fellow players.  Works especially well with the expansion.

The rules for this game try to solve the usual defect of coop games (experienced players ordering around inexperienced players a puppets) by forcing player to keep their cards secret from one another. In practice, this is a difficult taboo to enforce. Players will still naturally try to communicate the strength of their hands by using vague language ("I'd be good for this quest"), and the inability to accurately express card quality gets compensated by a lot more discussion, using aggravatingly fuzzy terms. ("I just put down a tough card, but not a really tough card. It's not as bad as the last one I put down, but it's still worse than average", etc, etc)

The production standards are high, and it's close enough to being a Euro that you can sell it to non-geeks who would flinch when offered something with dice and armies. I recommend it as a compromise game that suits a number of tastes, though none perfectly.

Played once. Seemed better in some regards than Lord of the Rings (another grand scale cooperative game) especially because of the possible existence of a traitor. Thematically, certain parts seemed a little strange. Sorry, Camelot is under attack by 11 catapults, but I need to travel far into the woods to fight a single knight, apparently because he is wearing black armor. Even so, for the most part, it was a fun balancing act of how much to commit to the various parts of the game all the while considering who was about to stab you in the back.

The comment above is from 2007. I played again in 2016 and felt that this game has largely been outshined by later released. Battlestar Galactica and Dead of Winter are two that come to mind that are generally stronger than this one.

Update 11/30/05: 8 to 7 Both times we've played this since I've owned it the endgame has been very unsatisfying.  In both instances we were actually hoping to fail quests to fill the round table since we couldn't afford to leave Camelot to successfully complete a quest since the siege engines would kill us.  In both games we ended up losing.  **Update 1/11/06: 7 to 6.  I don't see us playing this one anytime soon.**Update 9/13/06: 6 to 5.  Continues to slide.**Update 11/22/06: 5 to 3.  I really doubt we'll ever play this again.  Tedious exercise, way too much downtime and decision-making by committee.  In short, this game is a horrible CF.

If you like cooperative games this is the one for you. Can support a lot of players. Great for the board game enthusiast family. The traitor adds quite a bit of flavor to the game too.

Art is beautiful. Theme is fun and is carried out wonderfully through the games mechanics.

RATING: 9
This game can run kind of long for the gameplay involved, but it's still a fun.  The traitor mechanic makes you keep guessing who is good or evil the whole game because you don't know why someone went on that quest or why the keep laying face down cards.  Only game I know of that still plays well (not perfect) if joining the game late or leaving the game early.  Best in larger groups with guaranteed traitor (2 if you're a pro).  Expansion is fun, but not necessary.

RATING: 6
The first time I played this, we played it as a straight co-operative game, with no Traitors.  That was a relief, because we barely survived to win the game!  With potential traitors, we would have wasted too much time second-guessing each other to win.

I think this works well as a challenging co-op game.  But on the whole, I prefer Pandemic.  I don't like it that a player can lose all their life points and thus be out of the game; in Pandemic, everybody lives or dies at the same time, so it's truly co-operative until the end.

This is a fun game.  Having somebody constantly making accusations really makes if fun.  I, of course, am happy to be that guy.  One very bad experience with an alpha gamer so far.

Played over 40 times.

Played with 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 players.  The game scales really well, not to mention players can enter or leave the game at any time, thus removing the need of running a filler while waiting for late arrivals.

In order to experience this game at its fullest, it is critical one aderes to the rules in that no specific information is provided.  General comments are fine, but no details can be provided.  Thus, "I can fight the Dragon but cannot defeat it" means that a player can play some cards but does not have all the cards required to win that Quest, thus help is needed.  What kind of help? (i.e. which cards?)  That's what can't be told.

The game can be difficult to win without a traitor, and can quickly become impossible to win when there is a traitor in your midst.  You must observe every player's actions in order to see if there is indeed a traitor.

During the "Progression of Evil" phase, the player has to choose between three options, all of which are bad, so picking the one which is least damaging to your cause can be nail biting!

When playing the Knight's action phase, you must try to maximize your EVERY move.  One wasted move can have nasty consequences.

Selflessness goes a long way as it can help another Knight, who in turn may be able to help you.

Since the priority of the different quests varies from game to game, there is a lot of replay value in here!  Each Knight's special ability mixes things up even more.

An awesome game!  Kudos to DoW for another winner!

[Initial Impression: 7]
I really enjoy the collaborative aspect of this game, as does everyone I've played it with (some of whom initially said, "What, no winner - how can that be fun?").  It is especially appealing for occasional gamers and friendly groups. Without a traitor, the game can be quickly "solved" (after 2 or 3 plays) by learning which quests to complete and which to allow to fail.  However, the traitor adds excitement and mystery to the game (especially since different players have different traitorious styles). The highlights of play include the mindgames and traps set by loyal players who are all suspicious of one another, the moment when the traitor is finally revealed and the resulting race to recover from the sabotage.

This cooperative game is a lot of fun.  Everyone is a knight of the Round Table and you work together to complete quests.  The game is challenging and the possibility of a hidden traitor keeps the game from getting too stale.  I've played this game so many times because my college buddies love it.  This is also why I'm burned out on it.

I had to lower this one to a 9.  Over time, I've found that this game even with Merlin's Company doesn't hold up against Pandemic with On The Brink.  The traitor mechanic is interesting, but games like Battlestar Galactica handle it more elegantly.  This is still a fantastic co-op game with being easy to teach and play, as well as heavily thematic.  Though as a fellow gamer pointed out, you often don't have a lot of choices on a turn and the strategy becomes pretty obvious.  The games don't tend to flow much differently, so each experience is relatively the same, and if you omit the traitor element, it can be downright easy and rather boring if the cards fall in your favor.

Still, it's the only game I have that can provide the tenseness of a traitor element and play in under 90 minutes.  It does provide an alternative to Pandemic, but I cannot give them both a 10.  This one has to fall, despite still greatly enjoying the game.

Picked this up on a whim when out and about on a weekend break with the family.

Only played a two player variant so far as an exercise in teaching the rules (we each had two knights), and won handily.

It's an okay game.  It's easy to teach and play, but felt a little 'flat'. I haven't felt too compelled to dust it off since, and probably won't unless we have 3+ players and can introduce the traitor mechanic into play.  I could see it potentially gaining another point or so in my rating under those circumstances - we'll see.

My first co-op board game. I find it fun, but there are some basic strategies to follow for an optimal game that you rarely deviate from.

RATING: 7
This is a visually attractive game, and is in the rare category of cooperative games.  I like the theme and ease of play.  It encourages a healthy dose of Monty Python quotes and rants! 

The down side is a difficulty to balance witheld information with shared information, and the feeling that the cards sets are just a variation on Rummy.  Also, like many cooperatives, you feel that it is entirely luck driven.  When (If) you are the traitor, you find your actions to be innefective, and your strategy difficult.

The traitor mechanic makes the game. Otherwise, the (other) mechanics (put a card on the board, flip over a card...wait...wait...wait...rinse-and-repeat) are not particularly enthralling. That said, I'm a total sucker for semi-cooperative games.

BSG does a much better job of giving the traitor more interesting things to subversively hinder the team. However, one great thing about Shadows is that there is a lot more motivation for the traitor to stay hidden the whole game, which in my experience leads to more instances of tense late-game situations in which winning or losing actually depends on uncovering the identity of the traitor. BSG, on the other hand, loses some of its luster when all the cylons are revealed.

Hm. Not entirely sure about this one. It did offer some excitement, what with the possibility of one or more traitors being in the group, but it was another game which was a little too full for my tastes. Playable, but not nearly as much fun as several shorter games I could play in the same time.

RATING: 2
It's more of a cardgame (a little bit like poker but without the fun: playing streets, pairs, full houses...) then a boardgame which makes it too expensive in my eyes. Plus I don't like a game where everybody plays together against the board (except one traitor).
When I look at the scores for this game, I must conclude that there are a lot of players out there who think the theme and the design are the only important things in a game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A great game just for seating the awkward number of 7.  

Seriously, though, it's a fun game.  While I don't think it's all that and a bag of chips like others do, it is a lot of fun...though I don't know if I'd call it either strategic or tactical.  It's educated guessing and a lot of luck that allows the good guys to win.

(11/08/2008) Retrospective comment: First play at a wedding reception party. First time playing a cooperative game--extremely fascinating and tense. All 7 players were newbies, so one of them didn't know how to play the traitor. So good that we all played it again. I would buy the game for myself, a year later.

(02/11/2012) Comment after owning the game for several years and a few plays.

With really cool bits, superb production values, and accessible game play, Days of Wonder has been consistent with the quality of their games. Shadows Over Camelot has intrigue, tension, and immersion in the theme. Although it has extremely simple rules--there are only two steps, with a limited number of actions in each step, it is easy for the newbie to get bogged down in analysis paralysis. With seven players, there's plenty of tension, but the speed of play drops considerably with new players.  Unfortunately, after ten or so plays, the game's appeal starts to wane, as it is seemingly easy to figure out the game (or perhaps the traitor wasn't doing his job correctly? -- a common problem with new players) for experienced players, and there seems to be too much downtime for such a simple game. But that's just me. I don't mind introducing players to the game, but I'd like a more meaty challenge. Because it is a cooperative game, it is prone to "follow the leader" syndrome, where the experienced player can hijack the game. For the uninitiated, it can be very cool experience trying to defeat the game, or just trying to survive it. But after having owned the game for some time now, I have never been able to re-experience the wonder and excitement of my very first game. As they say, you can never go home. It's a "7".

Update (02/04/2011): Sold! SoC has found a happy home with a family with five children! Looks like they will love this!

As far as cooperative games go, this one, besides being pretty unforgiving, isn't too different from the likes of Lord Of The Rings (which I prefer). Some aspects of this game feel a bit disjointed (as opposed to LOTR), particularly where everybody seems to go play their own game by going away on quests and fights with saxons and picts. There wasn't much sense of purpose or team play despite the many efforts to arrange some sort of understanding.

Boring. We had fun the first 2-3 times, but after that there is not enough "meat" to keep our interest.  The only thing that can save the game is The Traitor and the tension related to his hidden identity, but once he is revealed, the gameplay suffers a lot.  Bang! is much more interesting game with the hidden role system.  It is CHEAPER, MUCH faster, equally random, and far more fun.

This game needs to be played with the traitor and 5 people.  More people and it's too easy, no traitor and it's too easy, less people and it's quite a bit harder.  

This means I'm less inclined to play it as it's hard to get that "perfect" group.

RATING: 8.4
Nice game.  This seems overwhelming at first, but its actually very simple to play.  IMO, its best with 5+ people since each knight has different special skills.  Having access to these opens up strategies and tactics which is important since each player essentially gets one action per turn.  Adding the element of a (potential) traitor really adds an otherwise missing dynamic that makes the game edgy.  In the game are several quests which must, can, or should be completed.  Some are repeatable.  Each knight will choose a quest to go on and rewards are received for their completion.  Some quests can only be performed solo while most allow, if not demand more knights participate.  Knights have cards and skills to help accomplish each quest and this is where each knight's skill can facilitate completion of the quests.  Oh, and all the time, bad things are happening around Camelot so choosing to go on or stay on a quest will make all the difference. The components are really nice and the board and cards are well printed.  I have played several sessions but since each time it usually involves new players, we dont use the traitor card. I'm still waiting for it to hit the table with all who know gameplay.

Very different to Pandemic, the variety of quests give this co-op much more variety and the traitor mechanic seems more interesting than the bio-terrorist. This would be a good addition to our collection.

This was my first cooperative game, and I have to say, I think I like it! I am the competitive  type so I thought a cooperative game would bore me. I was wrong. The possibility of playing with and against a traitor is particularly interesting. The traitor this evening concealed himself perfectly. Looking forward to playing again.Addition: Repeated game plays didn't hold up....

Az első játéknál én magyaráztam a szabályokat, talán ezért is tetszett meg nekem a játék. Szórakoztató játékmenet, de azért kiismerhető a játék és akkor elég egyenes út vezet a győzelemhez. A negatív karakter biztos változtatna ezen, de azért ehhez a játékhoz eleve nem könnyű társaságot összehozni, pláne nem olyanokat, akik annyira tudnak vele játszani, hogy a sötét lovagot eljátszák.

Plays well between 5 to 7 players. Beautiful game pieces, excellent artwork and rich Arthurian theme. Rarely does a boardgame handle so many players as well as this. It has low downtime between player turns keeping everyone occupied. It builds tension equally for all players starting slow then building to a big finish (win or lose). A definite recommendation for anyone looking for a 5+ players game to add to their library.

Would be a great candidate for a Warhammer 40k / Star Wars  re-theme!

RATING: 8
One of the best coop game for large groups. Really fast turns, and lots of table talk. It`s an old game, but still fun to play. Great experience, one of the very few coop games that can sit up to 8 people (with the expansion). 

An interesting fact about the game is that people can jump in and out. If the group is already playing and someone just arrived, no problem, pick a knight and join the fight or just exit if you have to go, really cool concept.

After one game, I loved this.  It was my first cooperative game, and I thought it worked really well.  After a few more plays, though, it got boring very quickly.  You don't have many choices about what to do on your turn.  Games with a traitor seemed like they'd be fun, but in practice it was frustrating trying to figure out we were doing so poorly, and if someone was playing badly or actively working against us.  If I'm looking for a cooperative game I'd much rather play Arkham Horror.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Overall, I've realised I'm not a huge fan of any co-op games.  At least the traitor keeps me moderately interested in this one.

Update: I played this a few times with my family & it's really starting to grow on me.

Update: Played a few more times with different groups & it has become frustrating.

What about that variant where instead of a traitor everyone has their own objective as well as trying to beat the game?  Playing the traitor isn't that fun.

RATING: 6.5
Initial rating after 5 plays - 8: A great Co-op game with the possibility of a traitor makes for tense play and accusation flying around. After playing games like Dead of Winter and Battlestar Galactica, Shadows can(at least for me) feel too "basic," but it's simplicity makes it hit the table more often since it doesn't take 20-30 minutes to explain the rules('cough' Arkham Horror! 'cough')

Still a solid game, and one people really enjoy. 

Updated rating "6.5": after continual play this game has fallen from grace for me. 1 action per turn is just not exciting enough for a co-op in this day and age. Yes I understand the game is over a decade old, but it has not aged well in comparison to what else is out there. Still it's a great game to get new players to learn Co-op and hidden traitor mechanism, even if it's in its most basic form

We play SoC at lunch time when running our school holiday program, Kraftworks for Kids. The program is for kids aged 9 - 14. The older kids really enjoy this game. We pair up the beginners with one of the Leaders while those who have played a few games are able to play without assistance. Sometimes we don't finish the game by the end of lunch but it can easily be resumed at the end of the day while waiting for parents to arrive. Lots of fun!

RATING: 7
A co-operative game that makes a nice change of pace, with the added spice of a possible traitor. OK, each of the 'quests' is frankly a trivial mechanism when seen in isolation, but the constantly threatening atmosphere that is generated makes the game. Ridiculously over-produced miniatures contrast with flimsy cards, and I'm sure this would wear out its welcome with frequent play, but very good when played occasionally.

RATING: 7
Used to be a good semi-co-op game before BSG came along. The traitor aspect of it has its flaws and is by far the most interesting part. The rest is bit too much abstract set collecting but still a fun game. BSG does it all a million times better.

RATING: 7
It's not really my genre, but I've quite enjoyed this game the last couple of games that I've played.  It seems entirely likely that the loyal knights will lose, regardless of what the traitor does, and just about every action in the game is ambiguous.  Which I suppose isn't necessarily what I look for in a game, but it does make it possible to play as the traitor without feeling that you are acting like a jerk, which is nice.  Has a length advantage over BSG and I find the theme a little more appealing. (3 plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Production value is over the top as is the norm  with DOW games.  Unfortunately, after playing a few times, I find that I much prefer strategising how to defeat my opponents rather than a system.  

Great game for those that can't handle some friendly competition and/or a little smack talk to go with it.  :)

A fun multiplayer co-op game, with a traitor element.

While the gameplay itself is not that exciting (put down one card... next!), the atmosphere it creates is amazing!

Our first co-op game.  Difficult at first, and quite challenging with a traitor in your midst.  Somewhat repetitive after several plays, but due to random card hands and a variety of special powers, each play is a little bit different as you try to take maximum advantage of your knight's special ability and play as efficiently as possible.

First played September 13th, 2007.  There are a lot of options, so the explaination takes a while.  (heck we were still going over the rules and looking them up as we were finishing the game)  Two players had played it once before and explained it.  We played this as a 7 player game which was fun, however after an hour, it really started to wear down.  It took about two hours to play.  It was my first coperation game (that I recall) which was interesting in itself.  It seems to play pretty well after you've all played it once.  For what it was, it seemed to have a good balance of strategy and luck.  Arthur turned out to be the traitor which seemed to make it hard on the rest of us.  I'd give this consideration in playing if you know someone who has it.  Based on the length of time it takes and the complexity you may not want to purchase or play on a regular basis.  If you do play, try playing with 4 or 5.  DOn't play with the max unless everyone has played before.

Wow, I really liked this game in a guilty pleasure sorta way.  I thought all the decisions left up to a player were very meaningful and that the atmosphere was quite tense and uncertain.  Keep in mind my rating is based off of one playing and that I have been warned that the game has a propensity to sour.  Regardless, I'm salivating for another run at those dastardly Picts and that unsavory Black Knight!  Of course I also feel obligated to make the compulsory praise of component quality.  Days of Wonder really does the boardgaming industry a great service with its high standard of quality.

Update:  This game has fallen out of favor with a few more playings, one as the traitor.  I think the decisions you make are only meaningful in an illusionistic superficial way.  There is way too much downtime and the game is far too easy.  To win as the traitor, the loyal knights have to already be so very close to the verge of no return so as to be able to tip the scales enough for defeat.  SoC is 90% flash wrapped around a boardgame with pretty bits.  Flash, unfortunately, always wears off.

A great diversion from our usual conquest and military games.  It's nice collaborating and accusing eachother.  It's also got great theme, as well as awesome visuals. However, after repeated plays, it tends to drag.  Once you know what to do, alot of the fun is gone.  I still think it gets 20 or so plays before this happens, and I've well got my money out of this one.

To me, Shadows over Camelot is one of the best cooperative boardgame on my list. Unlike other cooperative games, Shadows over Camelot is not steered by a single player so-called the leader. Because of the existence of a spy, players cannot trust each other. The chain of command ,which is the weakest point in coopertive games, is not working in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Ideal Players: 4-6

Description: Protect Camelot from many dangers while completing noble quests. Cooperate with other players to beat a difficult game.

Pro: Great cooperative gameplay. Difficulty can be changed using the traitor. The mechanics play well with the theme. The motivation expansion adds extra flavor and variation.

Con: Must be played in-character to prevent open sharing of information. Too hard with less than 4.

Artwork is nice, Board layout is fine. The mechanics of the game seem way simple ,and all they did was put pretty art on it. 

Well played it once with 3 players and it seemed like we were doing well and it went downhill fast. In the end we lost due to 12 catapults. The quest for Lancelot's armor and the Grail quest are downright impossible. The Dragon quest is stupid for you have to get 3 sets of 3 and you can only play 1 card a turn. In more players you could do it if you have 3 players working on it ,but then 1 is a traitor so it won't work.

I was rather impressed with this one.  After reading the rules it seemed like there wouldn't be too many important decision to be made, but actually once we got into it the game was challenging and required some thought.  I especially liked how limited you were in what you could discuss with eachother, this kept the game very tight and certainly helped the traitor character.

A fun game that I would be happy to play again with a group of 5 or more, I think that a 3-4 player game would not be so rewarding.

Co-op plus trader? Amazing! Plays in an hour? Amazing. Very fun game I enjoy the theme, mini's and the modular board. I will Play this anytime it comes out to the table. Beats battle star as I can't stand that battle star takes 2-3 hours to play......Much better than Battlestar Galactica which takes way to long to play.

A fantastic cooperative game, and really the one that sold me on the genre.

Most every other (highly rated) cooperative game fell flat for me in that they just seemed to be glorified solitaire games that didn't really require other players to be present (I'm looking at YOU Pandemic), but this one escaped that trend due to a few key features: hidden information, restricted communication, and the potential for a traitor. Given these elements, the game truly requires good teamwork in order to be able to succeed, and is a blast in doing so. We made a house rule that all communication between knights must be done in one's faux "old english" speech and that makes otherwise potentially mundane discourse absolutely HYSTERICAL. We always have a great time with this game. 

I also like how well-balanced the game is. With some rare exceptions, every game we win feels tense and down to the wire, and each game we lose feels like we were oh-so-close. I love that, and it makes for a very satisfying experience, win or lose.

A fun game, but the traitor mechanic is not implemented nearly so well as in Battlestar Galactica. In this game everyone must damage the team every turn but in a (mostly) open way, so much of the opportunity for subtlety is gone.

I enjoy this over BSG at the moment, dont know in whose favour/disfavour this is though. I finally understood what  like more about it. It has something you can actually do in a meaningful way.

RATING: 7.5
Being a huge fan of mythology (especially Arthurian) I knew I had to have this game.  I love it.  I understand the game suffers when overplayed as the best way to win is shown, but as I play this one as a treat for something different, the optimal path hasn't appeared to me yet.

This game is more enjoyable if the Traitor is subtle about it.  If they are just seige-engine, try Lancelot's armor, repeat, etc... then it is not as fun.  If the game is 5 White swords, 5 Blacks swords, a final quest to do and no one knows if there is a traitor or not, then this is a blast!

RATING: 7.5
Cooperative game that may have one traitor character. For me, the most similar to this game is Battlestar Galactica: the game has many fronts that have to be fulfilled in order to win, which makes the game difficult by itself, but with the addition of the traitor, that should await for the perfect moment to fulfill his/her betrayal, the difficulty increases to a higher level.
Positive:
1. Difficult
2. Not as long as Battlestar Galactica
3. The missions that have to be fulfilled are very interesting
Negative:
1. Not always is there a traitor on the game (an in-house rule can solve that)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very very well-thought and well-oiled mechanics.  There's some concern regarding replayability, but if you don't play it often, it's ok.  To really enjoy this you have to speak in proper style, create a good, focused atmosphere and so on...
Traitor is an excellent idea and make this game better (always play with traitor) although it makes very very difficult to win for loyal knights.

A great co-op game very similiar to LOTR where you are playing against the game however here there is the possibility of a traitor. This adds a great twist and some tension to the game but I am surprised how little impact it actually has. Maybe I need to play more but so far I'm not a big fan of these types.

Update: Played a 2nd game 7 years later. It would seem unmasking the traitor is a mistake, since now he can openly hurt you, and randomly remove one good card each turn ALSO which can really sting, one sword does not seem like a good enough payment for this. I’m not sure how much an undercover traitor can really accomplish anyway, we might be missing something here but it looks like letting them pretend they are good is the way to go?Either way, certainly one of the first good co-ops to really hit the market.

As far as Co-op games go, this is one of the best. While Lord of the Rings is very linear this game is the complete opposite. Sometimes quests will have an obvious need to be attended to but for the most part you work together to defeat them and keep them under control.

Though perhaps a little dry and more involved than it should be for something that is so close to being a gateway game, Shadows over Camelot is still a fun game. The game's high degree of challenge often immediately starts the accusations of which player is the traitor as suboptimal moves become serious questions as to whether a player has bad choices or bad intentions.

What fantastic fun - I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. It's rare indeed for my group to want to play a second game of any title straight after the first, but they decided to abandon the plan of playing 5 player Axis & Allies for another pop at this one. First time through it seemed overwhelmingly difficult, but second go we came in armed with much more of a collaborative plan and it served us well.. up until the paranoia about who the traitor was got far too high and the accusations started flying. Arthurs Knights reduced to backstabbing each other - brilliant stuff. Can't wait to play again!

This game was fun until we beat it.  then we knew how to beat it and won almost every game.

Since the Traitor knows how to beat the game, he also knows how to screw it easily.  Traitor won each time.

Maybe we play it wrong...

Don't know if the expansions add a new dimension,
but since the release of Pandemic, I see no reasons to play this game

Cooperative game, where players represent knights of the Round Table, solving quests and fighting invaders in an attempt to beat the game system.

Unlike Knizia's LOTR I just don't find SOC to be terribly exciting. With many players, the traitor mechanism provides some excitement, but the downtime is excessive. With few players, downtime is not much of a problem, but now the traitor mechanism doesn't work well.

Balance questions aside, the game is just not very exciting to play, and players are not required to do a lot of decision-making. Personally, I much prefer Knizia's LOTR.

The game does an excellent job of creating atmosphere, especially when the despair cards build up.

I was skeptical, started warming to it, and then stopped caring as the game went on.

It is reasonably well balanced, and is quite a functional game, but the strategy involved isn't very interesting, the traitor position isn't very interesting or hard to suss out.

I can see the appeal of it, but I've played 10 minute filler with more interesting decisions in ten minutes than the sum total of interesting decisions in a 90 minute game of this.

We played with a full array of players - and no traitor! The traitor mechanic is one that I find appealing, but what I feel is less appealing is how players aren't allowed to directly share their hand... but can pretty much say what it is without calling it. It feels like I'd be trying to describe a small living thing with shortish hair that goes "meow"... what's the point when I can call it a cat?

Anyway, I like the variety of quests, the specialization that players must agree on, and I'm looking forward to playing it again.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2012)

I was not disappointed in the game as I really don’t like any Days of Wonder game out there. 

This game is gorgeous, but as most Days of Wonders game, the gameplay is too shallow for my tastes. The theme is great but, sadly, the mechanics are very boring. You don’t have interesting decisions to make, after you go for a quest you don’t need to think anymore in many turns. 

After a second play I realize this game is no fun for me, I enjoy the first couple of turns and then the game feels samey and boring to me. The only thing remotely fun is the traitor mechanic before he reveals (or is caught) himself as there is finger pointing and shouting (and that doesn’t apply to all games as there can be no traitor). For all these reasons I’m downgrading its rating to a 3.0. I will resist further plays of Shadows over Camelot but I can be convinced if there is no other option :D.

My favorite mechanic is hidden roles, but if I want to play something with it, I would play Battlestar Galactica if I have time or The Resistance if I don´t. For me Shadows over Camelot is a bad game, but (as most Days of Wonders games) can be great to attract new gamers to our beloved hobby.

One of the first games to introduce the traitor mechanic and thus, is iconic for that reason alone.  The poker/card playing mechanic is slightly odd as implemented and the opportunities for sabotage by the traitor are fairly obvious and limited by the actual mechanics of the game.

I think this is the most fun my group has had as a whole playing a game. We were all laughing so much about how many times we were getting screwed, and trying to figure out how to handle anything. I haven't ever had a game, where no one wanted to take a short break before starting it up again... this was the first!

1-8 players. Co-op game in which you play knights of the round table trying to defend Camelot from siege. This is a very difficult game and seems nearly impossible with traitors. Have heard I should try it without traitors.

Great game.  Clearly one of my group's favorite games right now.  The expansion adds a lot.  

The pace of this game is spectacular.  I have not encountered the "boss" problem of traditional coops with this game.  

The tension created by not knowing whether or not there is even a traitor in the game is exciting.

It might be the theme (which I love), but I normally don't like co-ops and think this one is great.  There doesn't seem to be an alpha player issue because the unknown cards each player holds.  The expansion was fun as well, and didn't add too much to the existing game.

Played this for the 1st time on the big board at ORIGINS 05 with 7 players and it was fantastic! I Bought it right away and painted the minis and added scenery to the board. THIS is a true co-operative game with an edge of paranoia because of the brilliant "iffyness" of a traitor. It's the best co-operative game I've played, I love the theme and the components are beautifull.

I really don't like co-operative games.  Lord of the Rings didn't grab my attention, nor did Betrayal at House on the Hill (which this game seems to emulate).  I doubt that I'll give this one more than a passing glance.

Played a couple of games now with 4 and 5.  A clever game that I think is best described as "Every turn something bad happens, and you have to stop it through playing cards, unless you are a traitor.  Basically there is a 'death clock' that you don't want to strike midnight."  It's interesting being the traitor although it feels passive in doing things sub-optimally and trying to find an active way to screw things up.  The reveal can be pretty good though on whether someone is the traitor or not.

Good game - if played with traitor otherwise this would only be a co-op game that is game vs. players.

After many plays, came to the conclusion this game is not as good as I had once thought.  One game can be all in the players favor and the next could be all in the games/traitors favor.  All depends on what evil cards come up when.  To random and becoming less fun.

2013-03-31 - This is a great game. I know some people think BSG took the mechanic and did it better, but the theme here is more universally appealing. It's difficult enough as a cooperative game that sometimes it feels like overkill to include the possibility of a traitor, but that's when the game really shines. There's so much to do on any given turn, that whatever you decide, someone is going to disagree with you and suspect that you're a traitor. The paranoia starts early, and colors every turn. So much fun.

2017-11-06 - I still like this game, but it suffers a bit with a lot of plays. The secret to being the traitor seems to be just play like a good guy and then reveal at the end for the 2 sword penalty. Still a great gateway game, though.

I haven't played with a traitor yet, but enjoyed the mechanics of the game and the tough decisions of the lesser of 3 evils. It's interesting to have a co-operative game that encourages self-sacrifice to achieve the win (which may be tough for some players) although the game becomes a bit boring for those who go out that way. Playable with just 2 players, but better with more. Looking forward to the added element of a traitor in our midst!

So, this is a bit strange. You play as a team versus the game. It actually works rather fine, and the forced evil gives the game a great flavour. Furthermore it handles the theme very well. It is not a game with a random theme... Somehow I have no idea where my game is.

É um jogo cooperativo. Tem um dos visuais mais atrativos que já vi, com imensos apetrechos de igual monta. O tema é belíssimo. Tem ainda a favor a figura do traidor entre a irmandade que é talvez o principal trunfo do título. No entanto, achei as mecânicas do empurra nas provas como bastante monótonas. Tem alguma dependência de língua. É difícil bater o tabuleiro mesmo sem traidor.

A well balanced game between good and evil where all players co-operate to attain a common goal.  The idea of possibly having a 'traitor' within the group, is brilliant!  Kudos to DoW for offering the (.pdf) rulebook on-line before the games release.  

We also have the painted set of figures from DoW "A Company of Knights"... and glad to have 'em.

A little too long for what it was.   Wait a few minutes to do something bad and then play the card you've been
waiting to play.  Wait a few more minutes, do something bad, play the
card you've been waiting 4 minutes now to play.  Repeat a few times
until you wait a few minutes, do something bad and then move somewhere
so you can play the next set of cards in your hand.  Repeat ad nauseam.

Gorgeous presentation, of course.  Rating could go up with more playings.

I have played this game with 3 and 4 players many times, and we've yet to have a traitor, so I can't speak to that aspect of the game, but we have fun trying to defeat evil.

First play impressions: enjoyable, but not as good as Knizia's Lord of the Rings - and not different enough to warrant owning both.  

Seemed really weird to try to figure out how table talk works - what's allowed, what's advisable, etc.  Table talk is so much easier in Pandemic and LotR.

Also, no traitor in a 6-player game.  But it seemed plenty tough even without.  If we had a traitor, we would've lost BIG time.

I think this is one of the deeper co-ops and offers various quests. Numbered cards allow you to beat some of the quests. There are also grail cards for the holy grail quest. You draw cards that cause bad things to happen every turn which keeps the game intense. This is probably a favorite co-op of my kids and I.

I am a fan of cooperative games and this one deserves it place in my collection, alongside Pandemic, Lord of the Rings and Defenders of the Realm.  

The distinction here is that one player may be a traitor.  However this is managed very well and does not ruin the game.  Firstly there is a chance that everyone is loyal!  Secondly you actually have to help the knights even if you are a traitor - you simply have to help them as little as possible without being obvious. Thirdly you cannot accuse someone until later in the game so the beginning of the game still has the entire group ostensibly united. It can be a little tricky being the traitor as a new player but otherwise I can't fault it. 

The game's theme is its biggest drawcard.  Who wouldn't want a King Arthur game in their collection?  Second comes the cooperative gameplay. The opportunities for individual heroism on behalf of the round table are bountiful; the opportunities for collective teamwork are just as obvious.  

I have also played the expansion and it seems to be everything you could want from an expansion.  However I just want the base game at this stage.

As an originator of the "cooperative with traitor" mechanic, this game has some very fond memories.

A really neat take on the co-op game with a traitor. I like the fact that everyone has to work together to put out all the fires that are constantly springing up. Because of that, the traitor usually has the opportunity to screw over the players, but can't in an obvious way since she'd give herself away.

I've played it a couple times and don't think I'll buy it. It's fun but doesn't have much variation. Sure the traitor adds some uncertainty but not enough to make the game play change much from session to session. Waiting for the last quest or two to fail just to confirm the win leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, I like the game, I just don't think it is great.

Initial play was with a traitor, then after we failed miserably we played the next time without one.  I don't think we've got to the point where we can handle having a traitor, as victory is still pretty hard to achieve.  I have the feeling that the high production quality of the game sort of masks some inadequacies of the game.  There doesn't seem to be too many options to explore, though I guess we haven't figured out the best way to cooperate just yet.

Update, 3/15: No desire to play. Completely replaced by superior games that offer more fun in a much shorter play time. Traded away.

Lots of elements to the game. Easy to play. Seems like [b]stuff gets done too slowly[/b]. Interesting how the traitor element works. Hard to play the traitor and not get caught. Gameplay seems almost too simplistic, reducing the ability for a player to make a great strategic move.

Mostly seems backwards due to the catapult element. You have to spend a whole turn attempting to defeat a catapult. And then you HAVE to do a negative thing (place down a catapult) or waste a Merlyn and your turn. Just seems like too much negativity for this game, not enough progress.

It's still decent for cooperative efforts and questioning other player's agenda.

Best Co-op game I have played. My favorite part of this game is the begining players enjoy this game, the ones that can't compete against those who are good at stradegy games, this game is simple for everyone to understand and is balanced when you have good players mixed with bad ones.

The game is well balanced, nice bits, the possibility of a traitor much improves the game, not all quests as exciting, however the game can be unrewarding to players who  do not get to finish the quest (ie the extra cards and life points)

After playing 3 games with four players it seemed that beating the game would be really difficult, even when we decided not to use the traitor. Hopefully there's no absolute best way to play this. My rating would drop quite heavily if there was. Repetitiveness has become a problem in the long run and after finally getting to be the traitor once this got quite boring.

I'm hot and cold on this game.  Cooperative games isn't my favorite genre by any means and this one, traitor or not, fits solidly in that category.  Every game felt very samey to me; we do our best to find the grail but ultimately fail, we accomplish some smaller missions, but slowly the catapults fill up and we lose.  The traitor can't really do that much damage because they are forced to contribute cards regardless of what they do.  Even if they put 1 cards down on the Black Knight usually we are able to beat him.  I am even less likely to suggest this game now that Police Precinct has come out and implements the traitor aspect so much better than this game does.

RATING: 7.5
Fun party game, mid range complexity. Not too long to play, even with maximum players. I wish there were more variation in the quests, and some of the quests seem nearly impossible to complete. The game definitely creates tension as you're playing, a race to get things complete before the bad stuff happens. In the end, unfinished quests seem a bit anti-climactic. Overall, a great game, though.

A lot of fun, the theme and components are brilliant while the mechanics are very simple. Playing time is near perfect at 60-90 min when the mechanics, complexity and fun factor are taken into account. A bit on the easy side for my 'gaming' taste, but with the right group and a laid back atmosphere it is part of a well spent evening.

One of the first widely known board games with a traitor element and still one of the best. 

I've played with people who thought that there was too little you could do as a traitor without being blatantly obvious. I disagree with them. The game just requires you to be more subtle when playing the traitor. And even playing along nicely (and just not to the best of your abilites) can do the trick for you as the traitor when the game ends and you can flip the white swords because you managed to make everybody believe that there is no traitor in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played twice, wasn't hooked. A big problem is that if you're the traitor and your gaming group is a bunch of sensible people and not a chaotic mob you must choose between playing along ineffectively or go all-out evil effectively, which defeats the point entirely. Nice bits?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Has proven it's mettle as the game that popularized the co-op genre. Loses points only because the theme has almost nothing to do with the mechanics, though a playgroup well versed in Monty Python will keep you distracted so you never notice.

I was really looking forward to this game from the comments and reviews, but when we played it with 7 players it just didn't seem to work very well.  I think it may just have been my expectations going in - I was expecting some sort of RPG-like game where the knights gained better powers and skills as the game progressed.  Instead it seemed fairly helter-skelter in that all the quests were going on at the same time and after we rushed out to win the grail quest the despair cards kept adding catapults (our catapult die rolling was horrid, too - mostly 7s and 8s); we ended up losing after the special black card Morgan caused 4(!) catapults to come out in one turn even though all 9 swords on the table at the time were white.  It's possible I just expected different things and didn't have a strategy going in that made me not enjoy this game as much.  I'd be willing to give it one more shot, but it was definitely not what I was expecting.

This game just is not a lot of fun anymore. When I first played it at a friend's house I loved it so much I bought a copy. After a bunch of plays, it just got irritating and boring. The Merlin expansion came out about 2 years later than it should have and even then it wasn't worth it. If you want a good (mostly) cooperative game, play Battlestar Galactica.

RATING: 7.5
After a bunch of plays now (many losses :( ) I can safely rate this game.  Forget what you read regarding "solitaire" and "the game plays itself, you just follow along".
If you have fun with it, try just a little to roleplay a bit, and have a good group of friends, this game is truly magnificient.  Difficult, if played strictly by the rules and not too much "chatter".  But winnable with a good group of selfless pals.
One minor detraction is that, if played by veterans, and played selflessly, the game could be "solvable".
Currently 12 plays and a learning game.  Will update to see if it holds up after another 10 plays or so.
Fun as all hell.
Updated 9/05:  Another few plays: Dropped by 1/2 point or so, as some of the shine has worn off.  Still fantastic, but after this many plays has gotten a tad repetative.  Overall still excellent.
Updated 7/06: After a hiatus due to small burn-out on SOC, I played again.  Still quite fun, but must emphasize how important it is to play with the "right" group...

There's never too many co-ops around. The quests are great, and the "Traitor-amongst-the-players" was introduced first time for me by this very game. The only real minus is the fact, that there isn't much to do for the traitor after his cover has been blown. This game had to be done, so that "BSG" achieved that level of awesomeness it did... :D Is quite fast compared to the more slower gameplay of "BSG", so it will propably still get many plays despite the fact, that "BSG" is out. At least I like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Salieri-like, this game has survived to see itself become extinct. The timers (sorry, quests) are of much less inherent interest than they are in BSG because in BSG, at least there's more than one strategy to raise your food/morale/etc., whereas here, it's move, get cards, move, spend a card, move, get cards, again and again, ad nauseum... 

I wanted to like this, but it's just too slow. You don't get to do enough every round, and not in a Martin Wallace way, more in a holy-shit-I-just-waited-half-an-hour-to-move-one-space way. The choices may occasionally be consequential but they're usually determined via groupthink, as per Pandemic. 

These various problems could've been addressed in an expansion. They could've given you two actions and given you more choices of what to do with each, or allowed you to either move and act or just act. There had to be a way of making it work. Surely DoW has a few people who've played BSG, right? Itself a far-from-perfect game, but one that gives you a great social experience instead of neat mechanics? But sadly, it seems from a cursory reading of the rules that all the expansion does is fiddle with one of the timers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like it, but it got too easy after a while, which limited the replayability of it.  That combined with a personal rule against using loyalty cards if anyone has never played before, means we almost never play with a traitor, and even if we do, we generaly have a problem that all he needs to do to make the game nigh unwinnable is keep placing catapults.  Fun but unbalanced in one direction or another.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Like many people looking at this game, I was hoping that SoC can replace Battlestar Galactica for us, which we've been playing for years now.

The game is simply too short, therefore limiting your options. There's barely enough time for one, perhaps two trips somewhere to fulfil an objective or fight a monster, or you'll spend half of the game battling with siege engines on the board while other heroes fight dragons, how exciting... After which the game is over, leaving you with a feeling that you haven't really contributed or achieved much. 

BSG lets you do something every move, your turn or not. Adding cards to skill checks, passing executive orders, making decisions as the admiral or president or simply arguing with everybody about the best next move. Playing SoC be prepared to sit for 10 minutes waiting for your turn just to remove a couple of siege engines from the board and move on to another player.

A huge disappointment.

After a few plays the base game seems to be a bit simple for the good guys, the traitor doesn't have that much power, but I have heard the expansion makes it tougher for the knights of the round.

Mechanics are pretty straightforward, set collection and teamwork.  Turns are pretty quick, I found the downtime to be interesting because we were all working together but some people complained that it dragged.

[LUP 07-Nov-2006]I quite like it for occasional play, but I don't get the feeling I would want to play it often or own it.  Melissa wanted to own it though ;-)

If extensively analysed the knights could probably win most of the time, if played in the spirit of the game my gut feel is less than five knights are going to have a very tough time, traitor or not.  With six or more they should be OK, but it does feel a tad doom laden at times for a game with absolutely no Cthulhu Mythos connections.

It's a Days of Wonder game, so as you would expect, the bits and pieces are excellent.

I just bought this game a few weeks ago and our group has already played it 5 times. We all really enjoy the game, but we haven't been able to play with more than 5 people. So far, the traitor has been identified in every game and it really reduced his usefulness. If you have a group that is willing to play by the rules and stick to the spirit of the game (e.g. don't disclose cards in hand and play the traitor covertly) then the game is fantastic. 

I really like how this game works to prevent one player from quarterbacking. Each player is able to make his own actions and the other players are just going to have to trust their decisions. 

Can't say enough about this game. It belongs in everyone's collection.

played this with 3 and 4.  The 4 player game is much better and it is very fun.  I am a fan of cooperative games in general and this has enough choices too keep me interested and trying to figure out the traitor is good too.  I wonder if a traitor could be entirely obvious however and still win?  More players probably makes this good game even better.
Edit: played with 5 and was perfect!  I suspect this might be the games sweet spot.  The traitor's power seems more limited with more players.  Very enjoyable game.

Based on 3+ plays.  Mechanically, SoC is hardly the strongest game.  The "limited communication" rule is infamously vague and tricky to implement.  Also, the individual turns often pass by without too much excitement.  Still, despite its  flaws, the game is fun to play when one is in the right mood, and the traitor rule is ingenious.

Have trouble trusting your friends/family? If not, you will after playing this game. Playing with a traitor is likely but you never know who it is and if you want any hope of winning, you'll figure it out. Just to mess with you though, there will occasionally be games without a traitor. This game disguises fairly basic gaming actions (play cards in a set or a run) with a fun medieval theme hunt for the grail, defend against the Picts and Saxons, fight Lancelot, obtain Excalibur, etc). The game can be quite difficult to win, especially with fewer people and even more so with a traitor, but when working together is definitely possible. But who can be trusted?

RATING: 9
The Good: My current all time favorite co-op or mostly co-op game. Can also be fun played with the traitor with the right crowd. The components are great. Winning is a BIG challenge, which is good as that gets it more table time.

The Bad: The rules are very long. However, it can be explained in a reasonable time. You have to be VERY careful in explaining the traitor rules, as once the traitor is chosen, he cannot ask questions without revealing himself. A special reference card really is needed for this.

Kooperatív játék a javából, ahol vállvetve küzdötök Camelot megvédéséért. A Pendragon legenda alapvető elemei (Lancelot, Grál, Arthur, kard, Merlin, Morgena stb.) fellelhetők a játékban.

A játékot közepesen nehéz kategóriába sorolnám, nem a hardcore gémerek kooperatív játéka az biztos, inkább családi vagy lazább baráti társaságba ajánlom, ahol azért a szokásos party játékokon kívül többre vágynak és esetleg végre nem egymás ellen küzdenének a győzelemért.

Mindenképp be lehet szippantani ezzel a játékkal embereket a komolyabb társasjátékok világába.

A játék nehezíthető a traitor játékmóddal, ahol 1 vagy 2 játékos is a "közös érdek" ellen fordulhat segítve a gonosz győzelmi esélyeit egészen Camelot pusztulásáig.

Aki hasonló, de erősebb, gémerebb játékot keres, annak a Battlestar Galactica ajánlott (5+ fővel az igazi).

This game was a huge success with almost everyone I played it with.  Its a game for people who haven't played a lot of board games before.  It produces a sense of teamwork, but can also be devious with the traitor in the midst!  I love the fact that you never know if there will be a traitor or not. I am starting to become more and more attracted to players vs game system games.  They can be a lot of fun, however because the game system isn't dynamic, then the strategy to win often isn't dynamic.  However you still feel sense of accomplishment. I would like to have this game eventually.

Az első próbálkozás kicsit felemásra sikeredett. Egyrészt érzem, hogy nagyon hangulatos játékról van szó, de másrészt igen kevés dolgot tehetünk a körünkben, amitől persze elvileg gyorsan pörög a játék, és gyorsan újra sorra kerülünk, de ha egy helyszínre elmegyünk, akkor ott úgyis elidőzünk, szóval minden bizonnyal jónéhány körön keresztül lapokat pakolgatunk ugyanoda. A játékidő el tud húzódni, és úgy elég zavaró, hogy meg lehet halni, azaz ki lehet esni a játékból. Ráadásul én úgy képzeltem, hogy ezt simán megtanítom kezdőknek is, de most hogy játszottam vele, ezt már nehezebben tudom elképzelni, ráadásul a nyelvfüggőség is gond lehet.

Still not really convinced by collaborative boardgames - there's only so much challenging opponent-AI that you can get out of a random deck of cards, and the base mechanics here don't seem creative enough to set up an interesting "can you win in X turns" challenge.

All I ever ask of this game is that it doesn't make me play the traitor. I mean, hey, I play it when I want to play a cooperative game. Forcing me to only pretend to cooperate takes the fun out of it for me. But otherwise, whee! One knock is that this can be a hard game to explain - a player pretty much needs to know all the options and all the board areas and the traitor rules and everything before starting, and it is a lot of explaining.

Other knock: This stupid game almost always makes me the traitor. What did I do to deserve that, I wonder. Had to drop my rating because of that, and because I always seem to wind up in a game with at least a couple of players who just take too long on their turns. Turns should be lightning fast, decisions are rarely difficult, but when you have other people who just can't do the thing that they are clearly going to do without first staring at everything for 2 minutes...well, you wind up waiting 5 minutes for your 10-second turn, and that's plain boring.

It's ok.  I feel like I have to rate this one a '5' since every time I play it everyone else seems to enjoy it more than I do.  Some of that is familiarity and again I've just never liked it enough to own it or seek out to play it.  For a game with a traitor element I far prefer Battlestar Galactica.  I find BSG far more thematic and the gameplay much more interesting.

RECOMMENDED INSTEAD:  Battlestar Galactica.

RATING: 6
Acquired in 2005. I've only played five games and I think part of the problem is teaching it to newcomers. This often means not having a traitor (which makes the game much more interesting); I think three out of my five games were this way. I think my rating will go up after more plays with the traitor included. It just doesn't hit the table often. Lord of the Rings is a much cleaner design for a cooperative game. The components of SoC are superb. It's a beauty, as expected from Days of Wonder.

Great cooperative game!  More than any other game I've ever played, it generates a real dramatic tension in its endgame, as the knights of the round table work furiously to complete quests while certain defeat lurks around every corner.  It has a great, well-integrated theme, cool gameplay, an absolutely beautiful board and bits, and reasonable play-time. Truly a great game!

RATING: 5
The bits and theme are excellent and the game is good.  The addition of a possible traitor to a cooperative game gives the game a "Werewolf" aspect.  Is there a traitor?  Who is it?  Days of Wonder has another hit on their hands.(May 2005, Kublacon)  

UPDATE:  Not much strategy to this game.  It's almost a party game as the interaction between the players is the important part of the game.  A good game when you don't want to think much and just have a good time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice quality components in this one, but as with other Days of Wonder games I just find it a bit too stripped down and simplified for my tastes. There are times when it's OK for a game to be fiddly, if it enhances gameplay. With Shadows over Camelot I feel like they could have had a more engaging game if they had been willing to increase its complexity.

RATING: 4
Beautifully produced but below average cooperative family game. This is not my favourite game system, although I like Lord of the Rings a lot. Gameplay is very straightforward and not really engaging. Battlestar Galactica is much much better! ***** Remarks on the first plays of SoC: * play 1: 7 players, no traitor present (the loyalty of one of the knights was questioned, resulting in one of the few black swords), the knights won, not much suspense, rather easy victory. The sense of looming defeat, like there always is in LoTR, was lacking. It felt rather easy to beat the game system. * play 2: 7 players, with traitor (myself), the knights won, but it was a very close victory. By the way, once you are revealed as traitor, the already limited thinking you had to do as knight is pretty much over. Probably not a smart move to reveal yourself with the fate card ...

This game is beautiful to look at and exquisitely frustrating to play (but in a good way, really). It's well balanced and requires good teamwork, but some randomness and a lot of frustration if you don't get a good team player (or have a really good traitor) can make the experience less than fun at times.

An great idea for a semi-co-op game with a traitor element. Playing with people new to the hobby and aren't used to bluffing/sabotage may not know what to do if they're the traitor. Still fun, nonetheless, but definitely not for everybody.

I like to play in Camelota (not behind  often, because is quickly bored, but once in a while) with persons which want well to play and do not deceive. The greatest delight gives the uncertainty, whether is the traitor or else has not  him. On the other hand often I feel disappointed with these that somebody him was, but with her own game excessively did not make difficult (not all they are ideal saboteurs ;) ). For me the optimum-quantity of players to Camelota is 5 persons; at 6 and 7 he is too easily. The very fine game, where players must act jointly, to win.

RATING: 6.9
This game is easy if the traitor is a really bad player, or if there is no traitor. When the Traitor is remotely strategic (with just he slightest bit of skill) the game is very very difficult. I have lost pretty much every time when someone talented is the traitor. But all that aside, this is a very fun Co-Op game. I enjoy the co-op style every once in awhile. It's nice to mix things up.

I love traitor games. Played this 4 times, been the traitor three of those times. I love being a traitor, but I also like playing with the 'good guys'. I'd play it again just to see the look of desperation on some peoples faces when the traitor is revealed (and it wasn't who they expect).
Shrewd backstabbing ftw!

EDIT: Compared to Battestar Galactica, the traitor mechanic in this game is actually quite weak and uninteresting. Once revealed, the traitor has no more interesting choices to make and is far more easily countered.

When Shadows was released, there were very few coop games. Hence the rave reviews it got.

Nowadays, coop games, or coop with traitor games are everywhere and Shadows' flaws are painful.

The traitor is just too damn powerful. There is no way to snuff him out and once he is revealed, he is even more powerful. That's why we stop playing with traitor rule.

But even in full coop mode, the game suffers from several flaws. The worse being that the knights maximise their chance of success by doing very dishonorable things :
- All knights without important items (such as the Graal) should suicide themselves to reduce the number of bad cards per turn.
- Once you have enough white swords, knights should try to fail quest as fast as they can before catapults make them lose the game.

For the perfect "coop game with traitor", check out Battlestar Galactica

Cool concept.  It's odd playing a game where almost everyone is on one team.  I liked the game personally, but you have to be in the right frame of mind with a few other folks.  The game is really much too easy if when the Traiter does not get selected.

The only slightly redeeming aspect of this entire game is the possible presence of a traitor. Unfortunately, every time I have played this game, it has led to everyone second guessing everyone else's every move. A lot of people seem to say that this game is more about the experience than anything. For me, the experience was down right terrible. I wouldn't touch this game again with a ten foot pole.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
After a number of viewings and one full play-through, I remain unimpressed.  The theme seems thinner than a cooperative game should warrant (e.g., LotR), and a lot of the choices seem rather limited.  Players can't make many meaningful decisions to help each other, which seems to be the core of a cooperative game.  Since there's a cost to move from quest to quest, they usually just focus on their own activities.  At best, they can coordinate (sort of) the playing of number cards to the same area, and therein lies the problem: it feels like you're just playing number cards rather than fending off invading Saxons.  Even with role-players trying to get into the spirit of things, they couldn't dispel the reality that we needed another 4 card to complete the straight or another 3 to finish the full house.  It just takes too long for too few interesting choices.

Zero replayability.  I can't understand how this game is getting so much praise and interest!  Last week, my gaming group played it twice in one night.  Those games we played were somewhat fun (I would have rated them perhaps a 6-7) but it will now never come out again.  I believe all 6 who played feel as I do.  It's not really a game at all.  It's an event - one that is done after just 1 or 2 tries.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Shadows over Camelot is a cooperative/semi-cooperative hand management and deduction-based board game for 3-7 players.

Each player represents a knight of the Round Table and they must collaborate to overcome a number of quests - ranging from defeating the Black Knight to the search for the Holy Grail. Completed Quests place white swords on the Round Table; failed Quests add black swords and/or siege engines around Camelot. The knights are trying to build a majority of white swords on the Table before Camelot falls.

On each knights' turn they take a 'heroic action', moving to a new Quest, building their hand or playing cards to advance the forces of good. However, they must also choose one of three evil actions, each of which will bring Camelot closer to defeat.

Moreover, one of the knights may be a Traitor - pretending to be a loyal member of the party but secretly hindering their fellows in subtle ways, biding their time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment...

Sometimes a little long for what it is, however.

Simple to learn and set up, this game strikes an uneasy balance between cooperation and secrecy between players. The rule to not reveal hand contents feels somewhat forced at times and leads to a bit of frustration.

The other problem is that there is little replay value and it is hard to make variants and alterations because everything is bound together.

"I'm not the traitor!  You are too!  No, I'm not, you are!"  It's one of my favorite co-operative group game.  Not knowing who, or if there is a traitor is a fabulous mechanic.  I also believe firmly, after playing numerous times now, that the game system has a hitch or loophole, or at least has a highly solveable optimal strategy.  I'm in the camp that believes in exposing the traitor as early as possible is best...  As the current rules are written, the optimal strategy as I see it, is to distribute grail cards evenly, go after non-solo quests (Grail & Excalibur quests), take black cards after only taking 6 siege engines.  After 6 siege engines, every knight accuses their left neighbor (before any quests/white swords are won) w/o penalty.  This will flush out the traitor every time w/o risk of giving the traitor a trophy or better position to cripple the team.  However, this one optimal strategy can possibly be fixed/curtailed with a slight rules adjustment which would decrease it's primary path to success.  With a rules adjustment (such as 1 black card/siege engine for each incorrect accusations when no white swords are available).  Now, obviously, this is NOT really the way to play this game as it was intended but my mind couldn't help but try to find the chink in the armor.

I love the dynamics of this game where it is a cooperative endeavor to beat the game with a strong possibility of having a traitor amidst the group.  However, this game CAN be difficult for some people in that they take things personally which extends into real life beyond the game..:-(  Also, with more than 5 players, I would recommend that one would insure there is a traitor in the midst as I'm becoming convinced its relatively easy to beat with many players and no traitor.  Developing paranoia is a must!

08/2015 After 4 plays rated it a 7/10. Shadows Over Camelot looks gorgeous, plays nice and simple and is filled with tense moments. But I've had yet to play a game that excited me or had me on the edge of my seat. I need to play this with the right group.

02/2017 I never found the right group. Played it as a six player game once. Game was too long. A lot of rules to remember for casual gamers. Just beating the game is hard enough, but we never won with a traitor in our midst. Not my favourite genre of game. Sold.

This is an excellent cooperative game with tense decisions and plenty of opportunity for discussion of options on a given turn.  Of course, the possibility of having a traitor in the group adds greatly to the fun.  In the usual Days of Wonder fashion, the presentation is wonderful.  I would have to admit that there are occasions when one's next few turns are obvious and the downtime can drag.

Age and world of Camelot. Although I find the game does capture the feel of the world right, the system looks a bit aged fast.  The game has its moment when people talk and with a right group, the talk can be sun and intense, e.g. accusing the traitor correctly or incorrectly.  The overall game system wants you to balance risks faced by the group constantly.  Each player gets to do an evil phase, in which the evil forces would rise in the various quests. Each quest requires a different card formation to complete (except the Holy Grail). Depending on the number and types of cards in the hand, the players therefore chooses the quest to compete. The basic system is easy to get into for everyone but I don't think there is too many variations for you to deal with.  I agree with some observation that the game might get bored once you find it repetitive, just waiting to see what happens in Camelot and go to deal with the more urgent issues.  In our two games, one was accused incorrectly as traitor while the other one was accused but every one knew he was the traitor.  Still, not much you could do about it but to see the siege engines going to 12 winning the game for the evil.

This game was quite fun the first 2 times we played it. We have played it 4 times total as of today. I can imagine our group playing this game many more times in the future, however I feel the re-play value is fairly low. Will get the Merlin's Company expansion after a few more games and the re-play value diminishes significantly. 
Every time we played we played with 4 players, minus one time we played with 5. We won half of the games, and got close one time. Rule book is easy to understand and our first play through took about 2 hours with 4 people. Every one of our games take approximately 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. I really like the consistent gameplay time cuz it's easy to plan. May rate this game higher after a few more game plays.

It's a hoot with everyone suspicious of everyone else, even in games where there is no traitor. The core mechanics are fairly simple and repetitive so that it feels like a bit of a slog against the luck of the draw to get 12 missions complete, but the fun is all in the traitor element and the social interaction. Socially it's my best game and we just start the game with say 2 white and 3 black swords to speed up the game.

I've only played this twice, and both times I found it challenging (almost too much so) and tense, and that was without a traitor! I hear that it doesn't really stand up to multiple plays, but from what I've seen it's a fine co-op game, certainly more interesting to me than the Lord of the Rings game. (UPDATE: As co-ops go, I still prfer others to this one.)

A good cooperative game. The game is not really complicated, but it takes forever to explain because all the quests work differently.

Finally, the theme actually gets in the way of explaining the game.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite games.  It's cooperative, and it's one of the best coops to teach to people new to board games.  Love the miniatures, love the hand management and different quests, I think it fits the theme well, and the traitor plot really adds a twist to it, especially since you don't know for sure if there will be one.  Sometimes it can be really difficult (or perhaps impossible) to guess who the traitor is.

The only downside to this game is that the basic mechanics of the quests and the game overall are simple enough that, once you've played several times and you're a gamer, it becomes obvious what to do.  So I'm waiting through several other people's long analysis-paralysis turns to do my 5 second turn.  I look forward to getting the expansion someday, but I'm not so sure that will fix this for me.

Nevertheless, it's coop, so having my turn be gloriously deep in strategy isn't the most important thing by far.

This game visually is wonderful, too.

Hey - this game is better than I expected. I thought I'd be lowering the score after the first play but the opposite is true. Many people criticize SoC for being a card game in disguise (I believed I would be one of them after having read the rules) but the truth of the matter is that you simply don't see and feel this mechanic while playing. You and your fellow players seem to automatically start role-playing their knights etc. and the atmosphere is brilliant. And boy, is the game hard - especially with a traitor. Even though you have to play cooperatively you really get a sense of accomplishment if you manage to win it (of course we failed the first time around, but we were more or less on the right track and that alone felt good :-D).

My first real experience with a cooperative game. Solid, although with some odd bits that make it  harder to pick up than i would like. Good fun that will get better with more experience. Not the second coming that it seemed many people once thought it was, but nothing to be sneered at.

UPDATE: After a play of Pandemic, the relative flaws of Shadows are much more apparant. Pandemic is about as deep, I think, but plays much faster and with less reliance on fiddly rules.I won't drop SoC's rating, but further play is really going to have to show me something I didn't see the first time around.

First time playing this, I loved it. The artwork and components are phenomenal.

However the game shines best with the traitor element.
The game runs a bit long if you are more than 5 players and I had lost attention from some non-gamers while playing this at 7 players.

It's best at 4-5 player with traitor or else the game is too straightforward and has some very obvious strategies for the knights to win.

-------------------

Over the time, we find this game is not really interesting. The mechanic is very simple but no themes. Also the action are not very interesting. My gaming group don't enjoy it and are often distracted when we play.

I'm thinking this game is probably good for people who hasnt played many other games.

This game is pretty abstract feeling, with lots of victories just being a matter of set collection and accounting of numbers, and for the most part no special powers of enemies or things in your face to make you feel like something in particular is after you. I do like how they did the traitor mechanism a lot more than Dead of Winter though, in that it isn't reliant on a personal objective for the traitor to work. Also while the game is abstract, there isn't so much incessant searching, and the game is pretty streamlined.

heavy game with lots of rules. Need to play 1 game without traitor b4 u understand the game mechanics and flow of play.

The idea is good and the board is cool, but it was the players who were defeated, not the game.  It somehow happened that King Arthur was the traitor each time, which meant lots of wasted turns trying to move around.  Left with an overall feeling of not really being satisfied.

Another game that I want to like.  Going by the rules comunication is very difficult between players as our group read it.  Even without a traitor in the game it is ruthless.

I'm still looking for the cooperative game that will finally win me over.

Very thematic, but the rules require caveats to prevent the traitor from breaking the game (specifically, the "don't play outright evil").  Even so, loyal-vs-traitor player strategy can be summed up as "Play loyal.  Don't look at your loyalty card; just play loyal."  An unrevealed traitor will nearly always win.  As such, secret loyalties are better done by other games.

VERY unusual game.. I'm very pleased to see a co-operative game make it into the mainstream - the only other co-op I've got is "Space Future" and .. well, you know what I mean if you've played it.SOC basically has you and your compatriots attempting to complete a series of quests to save camelot, by each taking one beneficial(white) and one harmful(black) action each turn.  The black cards form a randomized timer on the various quests, ticking down to doom.  The rules are simplistic, which is good, because they have to handle combat as well as other types of quests.   This is another game like Arkham Horror that would benefit from a SERIOUS rewrite of the rule books to make plain the rules in a much shorter time - they are straight-forward and consistent, logical once you understand them.  The purpose and handling of the traitor frankly baffled us, however.A game like this has to make a decision between playability/simplicity and faithfulness to its myth, and for me it seemed overly focused on the 2nd (e,g War of the Ring.)  It's a hard balance to strike, however.  Personally, I found it a little too simple for my tastes, but given how many different things it does and how long it takes to play, I don't think they could have done it differently.  The game board, and pieces however, give the impression of richness and one does feel a bit odd when one lands on this colorful board and are told "you just play any white card, 6 times, you're done."  They could perhaps have simplified the number of types of quests for a bit more texture in the ones they kept.Regardless, some minor weaknesses aside, it's very very playable and colorful, doesn't take too long, and was fun, and of course, gold medal simply for the fact of making a mainstream cooperative game that doesn't come out handicapped or silly (re: Space Future)

I have played this twice, great f*cking game! after the first few turns we were really hard pressed to keep ourselves alive and in the game, trying to pick the traitor was an interesting aspect with any bad decision or shifty look came a host of people claiming you were the traitor, none with enough conviction to make a full accusation. I killed my own knight in a mad dash to destory a siege engine at one point, laying down my best fighting card, a two, thus giving myself a 1 in 8 chance of winning, i lost and the traitor placed the last seige engine shortly after... great fun, but hard work. A difficult game is like a difficult woman, it needs plenty of attention and romance before it becomes "willing". fantastic game.

This is a beautiful and lovingly produced game that cleverly retells the King Arthur stories in a way that provides plenty of fuel for the imagination. But although it'd not devoid of tactics, each player's turn flies by so quickly, and success is so utterly dependent on the order that black cards are drawn, that it can sometimes feel a bit too much like the game is playing you.

Used to be one of my favorite games, but alas, it has worn-out it's welcome in many ways.  I dropped my rating from a 7.9 to 6.37 as a result.  I find it too hard to explain to new gamers, and becomes a non-fun discussion fest over optimal moves with experienced gamers.  I hope Pandemic with it's shorter playing time can suitably replace what Shadows once was for me.  I still find the Traitor aspect brilliant... there may, or may not be a traitor amoung us... very cool.

UPDATE: over time, I felt this game was a.) too hard to explain to non-gamers, b.) a game that was too easy for push gamers to try and steer the moves of inexperienced players, and c.) not enough of a challenge for experienced players to want to play it anymore.

I gave it away right before the Merlin expansion came out, would love to try it again with the expansion.

One of the first games with a traitor mechanic.  The game requires you to advance evil by playing a black card, placing a catapult or losing a HP.  Then you perform an action to counter the advance of evil.  The actions are very simple with basic card play.  The game mechanics are pretty simple and it is hard not to like this game.  The only difficulty is that it seems optimal for 5 players.  If you have 6 or 7 it is too hard on the traitor and if you have less than five it is very hard on the loyal knights.  One nice aspect is that players can join the game late.  

One of my favorite games and if you can play with 5 it is a great game.

One of the greatest games I've ever played. Since I played it for the first time I just fell in love with it. For a fan of King Arthur it's a must-have, if you are into adventure games with teamplay and a nice twist (the traitor!), go for it, it's definitely worth it.

Another cooperative non-game.  If I want to play an rpg, I'll do that.  This is neither an rpg, nor a boardgame, nor a particularly fun experience.  The traitor seems like a clock, not really a player with real choices.  The other players don't have many more meaningful choices.  I might actually prefer to watch the hands go around on an analog clock than play this again.

Picked up in 2006 (Christmas 2005)

Difficult to succeed with less than 5 players, which made this game a bit of a turnoff for my wife and sister. I like it although I believe that there will be limited replay value with my family. It still needs a few more plays this year before I would consider trading it away and then there is the possibility that it will be a great game for my sone when he gets older.

Traded my original away and I am regretting it tho I suspect it is mostly for the production of the bits. I think that the game itself would get stale fairly quickly.

90 minute game. 
Min 3 players. Best with 5
These two points (above) suggest that the game won't get much play.

Mixed reviews as a family cooperative game. Although they do seem to be overwhelmingly positive: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/97023/shadows-over-camelot-revisited-why-when-and-how

Some comparisons to Battlestar Galactica.
Some have said the game is boring. But this is typically a seasoned game who wants something meatier.

Videos suggest that this might be fun BUT it sure seems complicated.
Pandemic and Forbidden Island may be a lighter/easier way to go in terms of cooperative play.

This review confuses everything: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/308846/will-my-friends-want-to-play-soc
Easy to learn (good), 2 hours to play (bad), fun (mixed feelings), etc.

This review seems to seal the deal (i.e., get it and it will be enjoyed):http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/119271/whats-all-this-then

Everyone we have taught this to has loved it.

We probably played this over a 100 times with family and friends. People love the coop mechanism.  

Has been put on the backburner for a while, but sometimes comes out as a couples game - we each play two knights without a traitor.

Beautiful bits but not really a good game. No tough decisions, lots of (card driven) luck and for me no high replay value. The typical eyecatcher (Buy me! Buy me!) with poor game mechanics. The traitor is the coolest thing of the game. Oh, and don't play it with 7 players: Such a light game where you have to wait hours and hours untill it's your turn...

Great experience.  It's too easy without a traitor, but it's still a brillant play every time.

This is a good game, but since BSG came out it may have been permanently retired.

We've played this several times with some players who don't always make the most thoughtful moves, and the result is that traitor or no, we've never won the game. Playing a few more non-traitor games will likely help that situation somewhat. The game is typical DoW style, with gorgeous artwork and great quality bits. Doesn't get to the table very often.

Great with a good group. I sometimes play it with a kids gaming group, but I have banned it from the table because none of them can be bothered to remember the rules, and I end up playing 8 different roles myself. They like the theme. They don't get the mechanics and coop. I did play with a great group in Australia. 

Update : I go to a gaming group in Dunedin and this is great fun with them.

RATING: 10
[Played more than 100 times]

I've played it (with any number of players; included solo with an house rule) several times and I've enjoyed all of them. Besides, it has been extremely well-received by my friends (five of them have bought their copy!).

It's unique because it is: 
1) cooperative;
2) simple enough to be liked by non-gamers, but interesting enough to be liked by gamers as well;
3) for 3 to 7 players (scales well and may be played with 2 or solo with a simple variant);
4) "open" (you may join or leave the table at any time).

Besides, I like:
1) the "Traitor" mechanic (it adds a very subtle psychological aspect and more tension when playing; it also helps balancing the game since it is more likely with more players);
2) the non-linearity granting much more variety and possible strategical approaches than Knizia's LotR;
3) the randomness used to give variety, but still leaving several choices to the players;
4) the balanced gameplay and the possibility to adjust the difficulty level as desired (e.g. to make it harder play as "squires", start with less life points and/or cards, put the "Mists of Avalon" in play during setup,... to make it easier play without Loyalty cards, start with more life points and/or cards,... );
5) the setting (Knights of the Round Table);
6) the great bits and artwork;
7) the good replay value (granted mostly by: the traitor, the variety due to cards, the possibility to raise the difficulty as explained above).

Average game lenght for us: 90 minutes.

Overall impression: it's an original, interesting and well realized game.

I've been looking forward to playing this game forever, and only recently I started a game with my 7 and 10 year old.  Sadly, the experience was a big let down.  The premise of the game (medievil, cooperative - work together to beat the game style) seemed to have so much promise.  But in reality it played weak and not strategic.  In fairness though we only got 1/4 of the way through the game, so I may not have given it enough of a chance.  Great board game bits though - some cool statues and treasures in the box here.  Hoping to give this another try with the right audience.

OK, so I like knights and anything with the round table since I was kid. This taps into my childhood fondness over king Arthur, Merlyn, and Excalibur. Pure joy...and there is a traitor *geek scream* however the culprit isn't the traitor: the missing details in the rule book are. We eventually worked out what we were missing and went on with our journey(s). Still a fun night and the traitor still did not know she was the traitor. *sigh*

RATING: N/A
In most games, players compete against each other to achieve victory. Shadows over Camelot proposes a journey of a very different kind, where you and your fellow players, as Knights of the Round Table, will collaborate to jointly defeat... the game!
At first glance, this task seems simple enough. After all, shouldn’t a band of young and noble Knights - fleet of foot and sound of mind - easily defeat a game that plays itself? Alas your quest is further complicated by the ever-present possibility of a Traitor in your midst, biding his time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment...
But enough words... Don your cloak, climb astride your warhorse and gallop into the Shadows to join us in Camelot!

Ugh!  Nice shiny bits but really just an overproduced card game.  Feels like Gin Rummy with everyone else telling you how to play your hand.  The Traitor is the only enjoyable element.  Gets old fast...

     The best coop game i've played.  As the ad says: a good game for those who used to playing fantasy RPGs but no longer have the time. The sense of each character contributing something to the overall success of defeating the game is provided as well as intrigue and extreme paranoia due to the addition of one player possibly being a traitor.

RATING: 7
Looks incredibly beautiful, plays surprisingly tense for a game that we thought to be cooperative - by the way, the tip of playing the first game without a traitor is a good one. We played right out of the box without detailed knowledge of deck composition and got smattered without the traitor doing anything much to oppose us.
Our second game convinced us of that again, although we were only a grail away from victory ... and finally, a close win in the third game - guess we have to introduce the traitor now.
Played 5+ times.

When I first played this game, I immediately loved it.  This is probably because it was the first coop strategy game I played.  After several playings, I'm less enthused.  The play gets stale, as there are few options in any given turn.  This is particularly true during quests, due to the large penalties for leaving early.

The jury is out on this one. So far just the one game, but your options seem pretty dictated once the game gets under way and the evil cards start to fall. The traitor mechanism is nice - it adds some fun opportunities to interact and taunt the others. this rating will either end up an 8 or a 6.

Update 2006

Gave this to my sister for Christmas and it turned out to be an instant hit! We played 5 games over the New Years weekend and had a blast every time. The game is difficult no matter how many play and each victory (and loss) came down to a final few player turns that could have gone either way.

Well done Days of Wonder!

Update 04/14/2007

Time to re-evaluate this one. I find myself not wanting to play this much anymore. It's like the game has been "solved" or something. There is a set pattern to completing the quests and unless you have a really good traitor, the end game will ultimately be determined by the Evil cards that come in to play. If you get a few nasty ones in a row when the Knights are weak... game over. I'm dropping this to a 7.5 for the time being.

Update 03/20/2009

Played this one a couple times after a long hiatus. I had a lot of fun but I'm still dropping the rating down a half a point as I found myself not as drawn into the game as I've been in the past. The game feels a bit scripted at times - the Pict/Saxon quests are rarely done to by the knights, the Black Knight quest even less. It's just so important to finish the Grail and Excalibur quests as quickly as possible (although there is something to be said for keeping the Excalibur quest at a "status quo" don't get additional seige engines).

We have yet to win this one, but we have a great time anyway.....have yet to introduce the traitor as we find it tricky enough!UPDATE-----Finally won in a five player game with no traitor although the Gawain character got bored just providing cards for everyone else to do quests!Introucing the TRAITOR next time! UPDATE----- Win this when we have King Arthur playing, Introducing new players ATM so still no traitor. UPDATE---- Finally got to play with a traitor; One of the greatest gaming moments ever! My wife turned out to be the traitor, A real blast to play with the game won and everyone convinced there was no traitor  (5 player game) my wife revealed her card and turned a 7-5 win into a 7-5 defeat--FANTASTIC!

Got this one along to my gaming group and despite the fact that there were 5 of us and we played with the traitor, we were all loyal and misplayed one rule that made the game a bit too easy, hope to get this one back to the table soon.
Played with the family and despite there again not being a traitor we only just made it; 11 siege engines and picts and saxons hammering at the gates! (3 and 3)

[b]Our first game (we played without a traitor) took us several hours to get through. Ok, we had a rather unfocused group, but it still seemed like it lasted longer than it should. Lots of rules, lots of pages to read, for what is essentially a rather light game. I'd like to play it again, though. Preferably with a traitor.[/b]

Wenn kooperativ, dann bitte Schatten über Camelot mit einem Verräter unter uns! Episches Thema, spannende Interaktionen und einfach ein tolles Abenteuer! Das Design und Artwork auch überragend! Allein für den Status, ein Spiel zu sein, bei dem du mittendrin einsteigen oder aussteigen kannst, ist Schatten über Camelot eine wahre Perle! Wenn Spieleabend mit fünf oder mehr, dann bitte auch Schatten über Camelot!

RATING: 1.1
I made the mistake following the advice of the rulebook and to play the first game without traitor. It was a boring game, because between 6 players we achieve 7 swords and, like it was obvious, we decide to combat the catapults and to hope the black swords arrive to finish the game.  
So boring it was that now I will make an effort to convince to the other ones that with traitor it is better.
I'll try to get a new chance and after that i'll change my vote. 
UPDATED: reading the rules clarifications in many threads I think it would be possible to have a better approach to this game. Scale from 1 to 2.
UPDATE: After another play with differents player and including the traitor, the thing was better: more fun and difficult (traitor win with 12 siege engines). So, going up to 4.
UPDATE: with other difficult game of 4, I reach the conclusion that ithere is not fun when each one is devoted to a futile activity: to put cards in an even double or in a line of Grail. Several rounds making the same thing to anybody has a good time, more when the Evil advances relentless.  
In synthesis, what I see for the time being is: or it is very easy and they no longer give desires of playing it again, or it is very difficult that neither they give desires of winning it in another opportunity, because when not being an individual challenge it doesn't exist the element and personal pride to achieve it, being reduced to a fruitless and boring collective effort.
4 to 3.
I'm thinking that i paid too much for this items ($55 to Chile) for the so few games that I will probably play.
I would prefer to like it to justify the investment and to surprise my friends with a game that has such a pretty appearance (my initial bias was so positive that I translated to Spanish all the Specials Black and White cards and the Special Power of the knights and I put them in BGG).
FINAL UPDATE: the last game with 5 player 1 traitor include. Boring. From 3 to 1.
The worst investment i have done.
Negative aspects: a lot of factor luck, boring repeated actions; few alternatives for the player, slowness  
Positive aspect: new experience, for not repeating.
Before our last game i played for the first time Saboteur: this was for all of us a great discover, with a lot of fun. Very easy to learn and to play. Fast. Discover the traitors or saboteurs was much more amusing that the same thing in Soc.
Aug. 1Âº: Sold!
Somebody has told me that I am very hard when putting a 1; but the description for that Rating is exactly what I feel.
Ok, to avoid to hurt the susceptibility of less and less people, I go up it at 1.1. 
Esto es lo que puse en el comentario del juego en mi colecciÃ²n de BGG.

CometÃ­ el error de seguir el consejo del manual y jugar el primer juego sin traidor. ResultÃ³ un juego aburrido, porque logramos 7 espadas y, como es obvio, decidimos combatir las catapultas y esperar que lleguen las espadas negras para terminar el juego.  
Tan aburrido estuvo que ahora deberÃ© hacer un esfuerzo para convencer a los demÃ¡s de que con traidor es mucho mejor.
ACTUALIZA: leyendo algunas clarificaciones en los foros, creo que podrÃ­a hacerse algo mejor con este juego. Lo subo de 1 a 2.
ACTUALIZA 20 JULIO 2005: tras un nuevo juego con otros jugadores e incluyendo al traidor, todo fue mÃ¡s entretenido y difÃ­cil. Lo subo de 2 a 4, porque puede mejorar, aunque la repeticiÃ³n me parece que puede aburrir mÃ¡s que en otros juegos.
ACTUALIZA: con otro difÃ­cil juego de 4, llego a la conclusiÃ³n que no se pasa divertido cuando cada uno se dedica a una fÃºtil actividad: poner cartas en un doble para o en una fila de Grial. Varias rondas haciendo lo mismo a nadie divierte, mÃ¡s cuando el Mal avanza inexorable.
En sÃ­ntesis, lo que veo por ahora es: o es muy fÃ¡cil y ya no dan ganas de jugarlo, o es muy difÃ­cil que tampoco dan ganas de ganarlo en otra oportunidad, porque al no ser un reto individual no existe el elemento desafÃ­o y orgullo personal para lograrlo, quedando reducido a un esfuerzo colectivo infructuoso y aburrido. 4 to 3.
ACTUALIZACIÃ“N FINAL: con 5 jugadores, traidor incluido. absolutamente aburrido y al tacho de la basura.
Aspectos negativos: mucho factor suerte, acciones repetidas y aburridas; pocas alternativas para el jugador, lentitud  
Aspecto positivos: experiencia nueva, para no repetir.
Agosto 1Âº: vendido
Alguien me ha dicho que soy muy duro al poner un 1; pero la descripciÃ³n para esa nota es exactamente lo que siento. Pero bueno, para no hacer sentir mal a cada vez menos personas, lo subo a un 1,1

First cooperative game that I've played and the paradigm shift is something of an adjustment to make.  It definitely has some flavor of role-playing to it, which can add to the fun more or less depending on the group.
I drew the traitor role my first time playing, and was not able to sabatoge the group.  I'd like to try again.

RATING: 5
1 play. The concept is unique, the gameplay is extremely well balanced and therefore it is deserving of some of its acclaim. On the minus side, the gameplay is essentially playing cards and is extremely limiting.  Because this game is co-op, it often feels like the game is playing itself and you have very little control. I have no itch to play again, but would try again if suggested.

SOC is a rich, gorgeous game with an absolutely brutal pace: Things look okay for the first couple of turns ("Twelve siege engines? We'll never get there...") but get ugly quick -- in a good way.

With multiple quests demanding attention, the prospect of a traitor in your midst, and a constant war between using/saving life points and gaining/using cards, there's always more you want to do on any given turn.

Having played this with the traitor, I'd love to try it as a pure co-op, Pandemic/LotR-style.

Shadows is a good cooperative board game heavy in theme but lacking in complexity.  I enjoy playing shadows as a light game with many players.  The main game mechanic of laying down sets or runs of cards is a little too simple for my taste.  However, even though it is a simple game it is very fun to play with friends especially with the traitor aspect included.

RATING: 8.5
Fun game! Everyone I played with really enjoyed it...maybe more than me? I had really high expectations, so maybe that played into it, but it didn't quite knock my socks off the first play. I think part of that might be due to the fact that I played the traitor, and I wasn't sure how to play it very well. I lost big time. Bottom line, if you have intelligent gamers playing this game, it's really hard to play the lone traitor (particularly if the player count is 6 or more). 

That said, what I did like was:

-Components: gorgeous and solid boards and bits
-Theme: Can't go wrong with King Arthur and the round table
-Variable player powers: These could have been more impactful on gameplay, but they were still interesting.
-Scalability: I could see this playing well at any count from 4 to 7. Not many games with this much meat can play well with more than 5.
-Accessibility: In the same league as Pandemic--a true gateway, considering how you largely are just playing poker hands.

So I definitely liked a whole lot more than I disliked. The group had a great time, and it's certainly unique. I give it an 8.5 for now. I'm hopeful this will go up with future plays.

This was a very fun game. Played for the first time with five players.  I liked how the game simulated the struggle between good and evil and it felt as if the game could go either way. Cooperative play was fun. There wasn't a traitor in our game, but the fact that one of  us could have been, made it interesting. I can't give this game a ten until I play it a couple of more times.

Beautiful components, but game play is a bit lacking. Really a card game, mostly a take on poker hands.  If it weren't for the trader element I don't think this game would be very interesting.

This is a interesting coöperative game, but the traitor adds some much needed tension to this game.

Everything in this game looks great, but the very abstract 'quests' get in the way of total immersion. 

I'm in favor of the rule that says you may communicate with the other players, but can't explicitly ask for a specific card. The game just feels to mechanical and boring otherwise.

Loads better than Lord of the Ring. I do think, however, that the game could bomb in a group that can't 'get into' it.

Three brave knights (5, 8, and 38 years) set out to save Camelot.  I decided our first game, and possibly all games, will be co-op, i.e. no traitor to try and get the boys working together.  The boys quickly took to the rules with only minimal prompting about the turn order and actions.  The next game will go even better.  Any special card (white or black) was put out on the table for all to read which overcame the 5 year old reading issues.  Younger kids will not have any problem with the game and it was an enjoyable experience for all.  I already hear requests to break this out again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In Shadows Over Camelot players take on the role of King Arthur's knights of the round table.  The game is co-operative, though there is the possibility of a traitor within the loyal knights' midst.  On a players turn they choose to go out to help accomplish one of a variety of missions, whether it may be going off to fight invaders, or questing after some object of import.  They also have to do something that will negatively impact the group.

The game uses poker hands to accomplish missions, which isn't really thematic.  Also, most missions have a real tug of war feel, as you do something to get closer to succeeding in the mission, but then something bad happens to take the mission's success further out of sight.

The idea that there may be, but not necessarily be, a traitor adds a nice feeling of paranoia to the proceedings.  Though not short, this isn't overly long for a big game either.  For that reason this is my game of choice for a co-op with hidden traitor.  While not as thematic as Battlestar Galactica, the fact that it is 3-5 hours shorter is a huge plus in my books!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The groups enjoy this game alot. Mainly the accusations of traitor.

A few observations:
1. Replayability Issue? This game is getting pretty old.
2. Putting Siege is like the suckiest Progression of Evil.
3. The game is like a timer of inevitable defeat unless the knights can complete enough quests prior to that end. Variant of Knights do not win if final quest fails is good.
4. Seems like traitor always go to Excalibur to burn good cards.
5. Holy Grail quest is suckiest (read: most boring) if attempted alone.

Update: Sold.

Some people think it's component heavy, which it is, but I like it in part because of all the different types of things you have to keep track of.  Definitely a steep learning curve, almost everybody I know gets slaughtered the first time because they neglect to look at the backs of the cards and take into account that getting the items makes the game much harder.

Players seemed overwhelmed when I first brought this out.  We quite liked it once we got the hang of it.  Players requested a second game immediately afterwards, which is always a good sign.

Enjoyed the co-operative nature of this game and the game play.  A nice balance of play options per turn which gave rise to many dilemmas.  Should we focus on the Holy Grail or take on the Saxon Army?  And what about that Black Knight? A nice one for seasoned board gamers.
Update: Enjoyed this game even more as I got to play the traitor last time.  I didn't get caught until they thought they had won; then I snatched victory from them at the final hour... bwahahaha.
Update: I've now played this about 6-7 times and still really enjoy it.  Whether it's playing with different people maintains the interest, or just the nature of the way the cards come out I'm not sure.  And as long as it stays fun, I don't care :)

I really like this one, it has a lot going on. You can work together, but also independently at the same time. My only gripe is the player elimination.

Played 11 times.
Last Played Jan 2, 2009

This was a lot of fun.  I like the co-op play.  We didn't play with a traitor, so it will be interesting to see how that changes the game.  Played it 2 more times.  We finaly beat the game  .  But we have yet to have a traitor in the game.  Can't wait for that day. 

Finally played a game with a traitor.  Everyone but me was new to the game and I was so distracted by trying to help people understand the game that the traitor EASILY won.. it was so frustrating.  Now I want to see a traitor in a vetran game. 

We played twice and the first game there was no traitor, the second there was a very subtle traitor but he was found, but too late we still lost.

Just played this with Merlin's company and it was amazing.      It was the first time we have ever completed all the 'one time' quest.  We had a traitor but still managed to pull of a victory but it was VERY close.

RATING: 8
Fun and easy going, yet challenging co-op experience with a traitor element.

The goal is to gather poker hands around the board to stop evil things from happening, while gathering white swords around the round table.

Also the point is to find the traitor ASAP, before he/she can ruin everything :)

A wonderful cooperative game with the most amazing components. (Especially when you add the seperately pre-painted miniatures.) It oozes theme, and the mechanics support it well. Plays surprisingly fast for something that appears to have so much going on. Love the traitor mechanic. I only wish I had more people interested in playing more often. But then it might loose its bright shiney; I fear the replayability is low.

So far, I've played three games--but with different people (except my son who has played in every game) and we've never played with the traitor yet in order to give people an idea of how to play.  I'm hoping that's why its been a bit flat except for the first game I played with my son where it was a close run thing.

UPDATE: With the right group (and with the traitor) a totally different game--a blast

Finally got a chance to play this one, was worth the wait. The mechanics and the uncertaintity of who the traitor may be keeps you guessing....and the game mechanics actually makes you an unwilling participant to sabatoge your own cause every turn.

We misplayed our first two games; we misread the rules for the quest action on the holy grail making the game a touch too easy.  The past four games have been much tougher with the proper grail rules and using the squire / 3 life point variant.

Six games in and I am already starting to feel burnout; the novelty seems to be wearing thin.  I love the components and I like the fact players can enter and exit at will, however, I have avoided playing the game during the past two game  sessions.  I will enjoy playing it a few times per year.  But on the other hand, I can usually say that about most of the games I own.

Lots of social interaction as the players try to determine who the traitor is (if there is one) & play against the game mechanics itself. The theme is perfect with the notion of the questing knights though it breaks down when the knights co-operate as a team in some strategy (so our house rule is that discussion on game tactics is only permitted if in the same location). Like to play the game though.

The "squire" variation is fun. Another interesting option would be if no one draws a loyalty card until they're a Knight, afterall, I'm sure Mordred was good once too (just loyal to the old ways)

Rating based on 3 plays, one with 4 players where we were all slaughtered without even finishing a single quest, a win with 5 players and no traitor, and one with 6 players where I was the traitor King Arthur and lost.  I would gladly play it again.  All in all, it's a beautiful looking game that can suck you in, but I don't know that the added complexity gives it anything over something simpler like Pandemic unless you're in the mood for the theme and a traitor.  If in the mood for the theme, this is excellent.

Shadows is great fun for various sizes of gaming groups, and one of the few popular cooperative games on the market.  As always, Days of Wonder does a fantastic job with the game design, which is a huge boost in a medieval fantasy game.  The gameplay remains challenging and fun, although it can suffer from the more-experienced players doing too much to guide others, rather than letting them play as they see fit.  It definitely works better when the players have similar experience levels.  It's rarely easy and the difficulty scales extremely well with various numbers of players, which greatly adds to the level of entertainment.  The fact that great fun is usually had and that it accommodates a much larger number of people than most games keeps Shadows on my list of favorites.

Still trying to find the best way to explain this to new players AND the best balance of "information sharing". I don't want to make the game too easy by enabling communication of what each player has in hand but it seems that people constantly try to game the system to accomplish this. Perhaps it is just me but this appears to be cheating the system and diminishing the fun/challenge of the game. 

Still I don't have many coop games and I really like to play this one.

Played this with my regular crowd and we all loved it.  Tight, tense, and exciting till the very end.  In our crowd, we all kibbitz, give advice and rag each other throughout every game we play, so this one is perfect for us.  It might get old after a ton of play as strategies become more obvious, but we're enjoying the trip so far.  Tremendous production values make for great eye candy.  Quick turns keep the action flowing around the table.  It's a little squirrely trying to explain the rules, but just don't try to explain absolutely everything right away, as most of it will become apparent through play.  Exceptionally brilliant co-op game for the right crowd.

I guess I could update this. 

My first two games of this were two 3-player games. It was OK and we were promptly trounced. The second game did go pretty smoothly and took less than an hour. We did get the hang of it, but still lost 6 white swords to 6 black (the first game fell to siege engines).

Updated: pretty fun when there's some familiarity with the game. A solid 7 it seems.

My third game was a seven player. It was OK, but there was a lot of down time. I would be willing to play again to see if the game progresses more smoothly.

My rating could go up.

Update: Hmmm I had a lot of fun this last time with the game: 2 back to back 5-players, one traitor, one not.

RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell: Knights of the round table co-op game. Jump from rummy mission to rummy mission collecting good points before the game sneaks up and ends.

Played as: 4 player (w/ trader)

Pros: Variable player powers add the right amount of spice to otherwise simple mechanics. A lot of good stuff going on around the board to make players sweat. The option of a traitor adds something worth playing for when the board starts to offer less challenge.

Cons: Theme felt a little pasted on and even though there were plenty missions, didn't offer enough interesting variety from one to the next to match it's 2 hour play length.

Other: My one play was with a traitor and I think I would have preferred to just focus on beating the board off the get go. This might have affected my initial impression and the rating I gave it. I can see the traitor being a big plus with some more experience just playing the board. I'll certainly play again given the option.

Best Use: A nice medium weight / length co-op game.

Somehow this game reminded me a lot of playing bonhanza - without the trading. Your actions in the game are pretty much limited to whatever white actions card you draw, and of course these are drawn at random. As such it feels like the game is playing you rather than the other way around. The only meaningful decisions are taken in the black action phase, and there is not enough in there to keep me coming back (maybe if the game was 60 mins that would be ok). My other main concern with the game is game balance. After playing 4 times (with two traitors), it seems that winning without the traitor is hard enough, and impossible to win when a traitor is there. 

Maybe I'm just not a cooperative-type person :)

RATING: 8
Such a unique game - plays equally well with 4 players as it does 7, though turns can get a little long with a full 7, especially if one of them has a hard time tracking whose turn is coming up, etc.

Turns should be VERY quick, often less than 20 seconds.  Each hero has a nice special mechanic which is valuable.  This is on the easier side of co-op games, but if you get a good traitor in your group - it can be really well done and just as you think you're coasting to victory, in a surprising turn or two, it's over and you're left in shock.  Very fun and unique cop-op.

The miniatures are great quality and were fun to paint.  We find the board layout a bit awkward - not sure on solution, but so many separate boards just feels odd, but it makes sense why it's that way.

Although the co-op aspect is interesting (sans traitor), the game seems simply too easy when playing with one or two players who know the game inside and out.  Having a traitor is almost required to make it more challenging, however the traitor almost definitely should have played the game before--limiting new players' introduction.  Interesting how the "minigame" quests seemt o work in tandem, but not enough to actually invest much interest in the game.

Way too easy with 6 or 7 players, perfect with 5, reallya hard with 4, impossible with 3. You HAVE to play always with the traitor, or else the game is way too easy. Luck doesn't play that big role, as some here complain. The theme fits well, not too much downtime... The problem is that a player with a dominant personality can take over the group, almost playing alone. The game has its flaws, sure, but I think it already became a classic.

Nice quality on the art, on the components, fairly easy to understand and explain... and yet while simple, I wouldn't call it a light game; but at the same time it's not too long. A really fun coop, challenging, but not impossible... has a POSSIBLE traitor...

The only thing holding it back from a 10 for me it's the fact that the mechanisms mimicking poker can feel sort of out of place. I'd rather try to do something different to represent a duel with the black knight than playing 2 pairs... Only that, and even in that regard I'm being picky, because once you're playing, you won't feel it that weird.

If you open the box and see the Quest and the rule book, then you get a little bit nervous. But its easier than you think and a very tense game even without the traitor. Great artwork, the only criticism is the definition on table talk and maybe that its a little bit long

RATING: 5
This game is really enjoyable when played with the right people (people who get into the theme and spirit of the game and who like to quote Monty Python).  If you play with "serious" gamers who think this is a heavy strategy game and forbid any table talk, it's one of the worst games ever.

The best cooperative game I played.
Usualy I'm not very fond of cooperative games, because they tends to be boring, but this is not the case in SoC. The game plays well aginst the players, who are always close to be overwhelmed by evil forces and have to choose carefully wich fiend fight.
There's a thing I like much in this game I never found in other boardgames: players do (if they want, of course) heroycs deeds - they sacrifice itselves, they risk, they fight against theri odds - and winning being "heroics" it's a fine feeling.
Traitor add some flavour and suspect to an already good game.
Winning as "good" is not easy when you play in 4-5 players. IMHO best played in 6-7

Here's a game that I can imagine differs a lot depending on the group playing.

The last game of this I played was by far the most enjoyable, despite the fact that we lost horribly, purely because of the attitude of the players.

Great theme, but one of the most convoluted games of any title in my collection.  Especially for this particular publisher, I was mystified as to why it appeared to take a degree in Advanced Physics to understand what to do turn to turn!  And then when you finally figured out how to do something, forget about actually trying to win the game.  You need to have the coordinated effort of the Navy SEALs going into combat to even have a shot at victory.  With so many other co-ops around (and my gaming groups' relative ambivalence toward this genre in the first place) this was the perfect candidate for selling.

My son requested this one for Christmas one year after playing it with his cousins. He loves the game and I think it is pretty good---excellent theme, design, and decent gameplay. It is not overly accessible, though, and finding players is perhaps his biggest hurdle. He can count on me, and generally his 10 year old brother, but after that it gets slim at our house. Therefore, generally this game only gets a couple of plays a year. He needs to see his cousins more.

RATING: 8
A rather challenging but nonetheless entertaining game which requires dedicated teamwork in order to achieve a victory. It's a bit like multi-tasking since you have around seven quests going on at once and if you're only playing a three-player game, then it's a little difficult to catch up on all of them - as a matter of fact, it's impossible. This is one of the factors that makes this game interesting: you have to make big decision which will have a big impact on the outcome of your game. You have to choose which quests to abandon and consider lost, since you can never win all of them. As you play this game you seek to complete the most profitable quests for which you have the corresponding cards, abilities or whatever. However, it is quite challenging and you will likely lose a considerable number of your games. Still, this makes the game even more intriguing, since you then try to look at what you've done wrong in order to improve for your next game, so as to increase your chances of victory. Shadows over Camelot is a game which really encourages teamwork and makes you appreciate it a lot. The replaybility of it is not very low as your choices depend on the cards you receive and on the various events that take place every turn as "evil progresses". Besides that, there is always the ever lingering possibility of a traitor amongst you who makes the game at least three times harder!

I love that this game! Players play co-operatively against the game itself and the inclusion on a traitor in the midst is really what sky-rockets this game from a good game into a great game! Make no mistake; this is not a simple game. Also, this game is HARD! We played and got our asses kicked even without the traitor but going up against insurmountable odds and winning by the skin of your teeth makes these types of games fun and exhilarating. Artwork and pieces are gorgeous too! The only real downside is the complexity of this game. Even though the rules are well written, it’s still a little hard to explain to new players. Also, it's at long game that will require about a 2 hour commitment. Otherwise, it’s highly recommended, especially for groups who enjoy a little back-stabbing and a good challenge.

Shadows Over Camelot with the Merlin’s Company expansion. After explaining to your non-geek friends what a “hit point” is, the rest of the rules explanation go relatively painlessly. Old-school D&D players will take to it like a pig in mud.  The cooperative nature of the game is a nice change of pace for the night, but the challenge remains intense with the possibility of a Traitor. One of our favorite parts of this game is the possibility that there may be a traitor in our midst. One of everyone ELSE’S favorite parts of the game seems to be accusing ME of being said traitor. Shadows frequently lasts only about 90-120 minutes, but can go over 3 hours.

This is a fun fun game.  Great theme.  I find it works best for me now when there are some relatively new players and we ALWAYS include an unknown traitor as it is simply too easy for us to beat the game without a traitor.  Very fun theme which has left us many clear memories of remembering specific traitors and their gameplay.

More a card game on steroids than it is a board game. The replay value is extremely poor. There literally is only one strategy and the game plays the same way every time.

A cooperative game in which one person may be a traitor.

Boy, is this game exciting. Ultimately you're just trying to match certain patterns of cards, but you're doing it while going on quests and battling evil.

Highly recommended!

Edit: after more plays, you NEED the traitor for this to be fun.  Co-op is 5.  With traitor is 7.

A nice co-op with a "traitor" element.  Fun to get into with the right group, but with the wrong group, it could be less-than-pleasurable.  Mostly due to some wonky rules regarding the traitor and table-talk that you just have to accept in order for the game to really shine.  Also, the rules take a lot of time to explain, but once the group knows what they're doing, gameplay can be nice and quick.  So, not a perfect game by any means, has some flaws, but in the right context, it can be a good time.

And to those who say Battlestar Galactica replaces SoC, I will say this: it may indeed be a superior game in depth, strategy, fun, and virtually every other way, but any game that takes between 2-4 (or more) hours will never get asked to be played again in any of my gaming circles.  We can knock shadows out in 1-2 hours.  So there you have it.  Maybe I'm settling for the lesser game, but at least I will get to play a game.

Nov2009: I ve played almost 10 games recently with my 7 yo and 10 yo sons, and they both liked it. My 7 yo even won as a traitor once, revealing himself in the final turns. So this game is fun with adults but also with kids, and very young ones!

Finally got to play a couple times, very fun game. While we've had a few skin-of-our-teeth wins, we haven't lost yet. I may purchase Merlin's Company to give the difficulty a little nudge.

Playing some other, more difficult co-ops has made me a little less fond of SoC. I like that Pandemic and Ghost Stories really try to kick my ass. Shadows sometimes really drags, too. Our last game went ~3 hours. 

Battlestar Galactica has made Shadows obsolete.

RATING: 7
I love the concept of a cooperative game, but didn't much get into the Lord of the Rings coop game. This coop seemed really  hard the few times we have played it, possibly because we desperately wanted a traitor to be present and accounted for.   Also, one complaint that possibly might be cleared up with more plays: it seems that as long as the traitor is "pretending" to be good, they can't be adding catapults on each turn and hurting your progress.  So, even if you know who the traitor is on the first turn-- is it necessarily good to expose them?  You almost cripple their powers by keeping them on your side for a while, which somewhat hurts the theme of a traitor.

Shadows is a very interesting and unique game.  The whole cooperative mechanic mixed with the possibility of a trader keeps things interesting.  Unfortunately, the traitor almost always wins, as he/she seems to have a very imbalanced advantage.

A fun game.  It's kind of been over-shadowed by Battlestar now in my group, but I would like to play this one again sometime.  I've still never won a game.  And I've never been the traitor.

9/26/14.  I finally got to play the traitor -- and I still have never won.  Close game and I was able to stay undetected while falsely accusing someone.  I thought I had it because the last two spots would have made it a tie with the undiscovered traitor flip, but apparently there could be an extra sword added to the wheel (I still don't understand why) which gave them the advantage.

The game is still very pretty to look at (well, DoW),  but game-wise... Well...
Occasional bright moments, mostly boredom and even feeling like a chore when the end is nigh. I get it, it was one of the first co-op games, so it definitely deserves a place in boardgame history... but sadly, by today's measures, it hardly deserves a place in boardgame collections. Unless you're a die-hard fan of Camelot.

RATING: 6
At first, the rules seemed too dense and confusing. However, once we started playing, within a few turns everything was quite clear, and then we discovered just how intense the game could be.  This game lulls you into a sense that you are in control, and before you realize you're losing to the forces of evil!  As a knight you struggle to beat back hordes of Saxons, Picts and the Black Knight, while trying to capture the Holy Grail and Excalibur.

A wonderful game with a ton of great story flavor. The game play is easy once learned and in the end provides a rich, and very dramatic flow with a totally unknown ending.  Very much fun.

Okay, admittedly there isn't a ton of strategy here but Days of Wonder does such an amazing job with the components that I'm drawn into the theme.  Of the few games I've played so far I haven't seen the huge balance issue (too easy or too hard).  In fact almost every game was in doubt throughout.  Shadows over Camelot will likely get more plays in our home than Lord of the Rings ever did.  It is easier to learn and the traitor aspect really adds to the tension.

All I can say is WOW.  The game is very good, it looks good too.  At first sight, the game seems complicated, but once the basic rules are taught, it goes very smoothly.  It calls upon some simple card tricks games, so almost anybody can relate to that.  I don`t know why, I have seen almost all the "bugs" people are talking about in the forums while playing and yet, the experience, the fun is still there.  Everyone to whom I taught the game enjoyed it a lot.

RATING: 7
Shadows Over Camelot is probably my favourite of the hidden traitor coop games.

Players must all work together to card manage a variety of problems the Round Table has to face before the game is up.

Not being able to give exact information on your hands makes trust and negotiation important. The traitor(s) can take advantage of the game's features to ruin chances of victory and encourage distrust.

I imagine with the wrong group this would not work well, but with the right group it can have more diplomacy, heroics, mistrust and strife then an episode of Game of Thrones!

The expansion is almost essential.

Due to the imprecise rules (what kind of talk is allowed?) and the one-against-the-rest mechanism, I would not consider this to be a proper game. However, if played with the right play-actors, I believe it could provide the background to an interesting improvisation exercise.

The theme is there in buckets, but after a few plays, and also after playing Battlestar Galactica I must say this is the inferior game.  the traitor mechanic doesn't really work, and the quests are just too simplistic.  Dropped from a very enthousiastic 9 after the first 2 plays to a 6 after a few more...

This game has really dropped off a cliff since I started playing Battlestar Galactica. Shadows just doesn't stack up that well in comparison. I'll still play it and have a fun enough time, but the game really feels "solvable" after a few plays. This may be an easier game to learn and play, but I love how BSG manages to get everyone to suspect everyone else without any effort on the players' parts. Plus the fact that this game borrows so heavily from Knizia's Lord of the Rings made it an easy game to get rid of. Still fun, but not nearly as engaging as BSG.

Would rather play Battlestar Galactica.

It was a fun game with which you can enjoy with friends while drinking. The theme is captured wonderfully, the minis are well-made with the high quality cards; however the gameplay is heavily depends on luck, except from the 'Finding the traitor' part. It is the hook of this game, and that's why I gave it a go. 

This game is co-op, it's indeed hard if players don't work together, especially when you're not feeling lucky, the game may be really irritating.

I enjoyed both Avalon and Dead of Winter and wanted to see how this cooperation with hidden agenda game played in comparison. Unfortunately Shadows over Camelot fell flat since the gameplay failed to engage. Either you draw new cards or you move to a quest where you play them. The theme appealed to me but made little sense with its convoluted connections to the Arthurian legends. Perhaps it works better if played like an RPG but as a boardgame, Camelot is indeed a silly place to quote Monty Python.

RATING: 9
I think this game is perfect with 7 people, as a matter of fact, whenever I have 6 friends over the first thing that passes through my mind is "I should get the Shadows over Camelot".
The game however has some flaws that makes for the 9 instead of 10, for instance:
- After a couple of plays you'll always know if there is a traitor in the group after 10-20 min of game. This bust the fun of COULD be a traitor, and either grants you that in fact there is a traitor or that the rest of the game will be annoyingly easy (and you can't even say let's end the game because there is no traitor, because there could be a traitor that does not know how to play).
- There is only one traitor and it has the same power independent of the number of players, this makes the game EXTRA hard with fewer players, but also ruins the fun because it's easier to detect the traitor. With 7 players the game is quite balanced, however the traitor doesn't have much power and depends on luck to win the game, but this is balanced because most likely you'll not figure out who's the traitor until the very end.

Fun cooperative with great art and a nicely integrated theme. We played it quite a few times, until we discovered the key to winning the game every time - and that was when we lost interest. No, I won't tell you - you have to figure it out yourself.

I played it again, with a different group and a different angle, and the game became excellent fun again. Upgrading it to an 8.

Shadows over Camelot is responsible for the renewal of my interest in modern board games beyond MTG and the occasional game of Citadels; and will certainly remain a milestone in my gaming group, thanks to its ludicrous production values and compelling theme. It has, however, several flaws that I can't honestly overlook:

- The difficulty relies quite heavily on the player count, which wouldn't be an issue if SoC was a purely cooperative game. We go from 3 players, which is probably unwinnable for the good guys if there is a traitor, to 7 players, which is almost unlosable for veteran good guys regardless of the presence of a traitor.
- The official communication policy is messy. The reason why the rulebook tries to set one is that giving away the contents of player's hands would make the traitor's job (hindering the game plan under cover) impossible, but having no idea about their contents would make team coordination impossible. You're left with this bastard system where you're pseudo-roleplaying sentences that are really convoluted, thus you can't sensibly describe more than a couple pieces of information every other turn without entering downtime town. Meta-gaming social etiquette as a gameplay restriction seems like poor design.
- The amount of rules to be learnt is disproportionate relatively to the simplicity of a game turn. I mostly blame quests there, which are basically "tug of war", "biggest total after reveal wins" and "race to make a flush" but take a lot more explaining.
- Some parts of the rulebook are poorly laid out. Every time I want another info than the full ruling of a special card, I have to pause the game a bit.
- The rewards and penalties associated with a correct accusation, an incorrect accusation and the traitor staying hidden the whole game aren't exactly intuitive and it's hard to ask for them without being accused of felony.
- The traitor has no strategic reason to bluff cooperation at all. Holding a couple special cards from the recycling discard and being sometimes slightly less efficient than the other players, in the hope you're trusted one critical turn with something important, is not as powerful as being openly damaging from the very beginning by losing quests and blocking spaces on purpose. Then if we compare the 4 swords swing gained from being undetected the whole game (at the price of granting several white swords before that point by playing loyal) to openly blocking spaces and choosing the worse outcomes every time at the mere cost of 1 sword when you get accused, the undisguised way will on average generate more black swords (which is not even close below 6 players) or simply openly threaten a loss to catapults from the get-go. The *actual* incentive for cooperation is that a revealed traitor is boring to play. Again, the game working on a tacit meta-game consideration seems like poor design.
- Discarding cards to regain bravery as an action is incredibly clunky, in the sense this bravery will likely be respent for the action just spent anyway. I suppose it's a hack around grail cards bloating your hand in the endgame, but having this mechanic and accusation as basic actions while you seldom ever use them in practice hardly helps with teaching the rules.
- Games of SoC are relatively same-y, because the same threats always hit the same locations, just in a slightly different order that doesn't change the process of dealing with them in any way.
- Overall, the density of interesting decisions is quite low; your hand of cards more or less dictates the quests you're proficient at. The relative obviousness of player behaviour was possibly designed with the intent of making players able to detect potential traitors without getting a headache in the process. And it's possible to be involved in other players' decisions regardless of checking whether they look loyal, but you can easily witness that anyone's turn often comes down to "draw a black card, do my thing, pass".

In conclusion the game mostly works and I will still play it with my crowd, but more out of habit than excitement. Oh, yes, a word on the expansion, which suceeds at making the game harder (for the good guys) without making it more fun in the process. The base game already features simple variants if you desire such a thing. Skip.

Very much like LOTR (close to Days of Wonder getting sued I guess). Brilliant idea, flow, game time (~2hrs), production value.
Though, like many other cooperative games: too easy to beat! We didn't play with the traitor though, but we never had the LOTR feeling of helplessness at all. It was just a designated path towards victory. If you have 7 white swords around the table, wouldn't a lost quest be sort of rewarding for you as well?!
(Edit): Now we have played with a traitor and it was well balanced! Though, still the sword flipping invites to exploiting

When thinking of a co-op game, most people turn to Pandemic. I like Shadows much more. While it can have a traitor, the game plays as a co-op game. It's built well enough to allow players to drop-in and drop-out as needed so it works great when one person is running late, or leaving early for game night. I love the theme and the game plays well into it. And it's TOUGH. Much more so than Pandemic. This might be less exciting for some, but I love it. If there is a better co-op game out there, I haven't played it.

Since I got my start in role-playing games, I really enjoy the cooperative aspect of this game.  It definitely has that adventuring feel to it, and the theme comes through very stronly.  I also think the mechanics do a very good job of scaling across the player range, and allow players to join and leave as they choose.  I also like that the game is hard for the players to win; it's a real challenge, and victory feels rewarding because of it.

I am concerned that the traitor is too powerful.  It seems that there is no real incentive for the traitor to hide himself, as constantly placing siege engines should be more than enough to overwhelm the good knights.  Add to this the fact that the traitor is more powerful when he is revealed, and it seems like the traitor should be played in an obvious way.  The game is still fun and a good experience, but the strategic level may not be there.

Great co-op game with a great theme, artwork, components, and miniatures. If you love the mythology of King Arthur, you'll probably enjoy this game. It's fun working together as Knights of the Round Table, attempting the various quests, keeping the Picts and Saxons at bay, and preventing siege engines from destroying Camelot. I would love to play with a traitor, but the game is hard and long enough without one that we usually keep that mechanic out.

One of the first games I owned and also one of the titles who lured me into the board game hobby, it's surely one of the reasons why this game is a true classic! I know, Battlestar Galactica is considered "way better and meatier" (if that's a word) but these are simply 2 different games and thus you should not compare them. I can play BG with some people while I can play SoC with almost everybody. Very nice artwork, the theme is there and I share some very good memories to many game night we had with this game... Shadows over Camelot is definately a keeper for me (and so is Battlestar Galactica, when I want a heavier game on my table).

If it was just a straight cooperative game the game might rate a six or seven, it would be good but not brilliant.

And the fact that the game can be played fairly quickly makes it even more friendly.

RATING: 7
Cooperative game themed in the period of King Arthur. Everyone plays a Knight going on different quests, such as the Holy Grail or finding Excaliber; quests are resolved by playing certain combinations of cards. During their turn, a player must do an evil action (draw black card, lose a life, add seige engine) and do a good action. Game is lost if there are more black swords than white on the Round table, there are 12 seige engines or all Knights are lost. The marvelous twist in this game is that someone can potentially be the traitor, and they win if the loyal knights lose. Without the traitor, the game is an okay system cooperation game (7 out of 10), but with the presence of a traitor (8 out of 10) the game is tense and exciting as everyone is looking around suspiciously. It's a fun game, but with 3 players, it is too easy for the traitor, and if there are 7 players, it is too hard for the traitor, so there needs to be some balancing variants, some of which are suggested in the rules.

I'd like to try this out. I'd get it if

1. It didn't need 3 players to be fully implemented since I can only rely on 2 regularly.
2. It didn't compete with other semi-coop games of which I have several
3. I didn't already have so many hidden traitor games.

It looks like an amazing game and I'd like to get it but with chaos in the old world on the way, there's only so many games that require 3 players that I can get.

-------------
UPDATE: Cou'dnlt help myself. Bought this along with Merlins company and company of knights. Looks amazing. Can't wait to play.

UPDATE: I love this game. Played it solo, played it two player full coop. Played it four player with 25% chance of no traitor and also played it 4 player with 1 traitor for sure. It shines in all these ways especially this last. Its a strategic game that has the suspicion and bluffing element but its light enough that new players can jump into it fairly easily. There are definite strategies that should be taken; some people have said it's "solved". I wouldn't go that far, but the theme, components, flavor and bluffing/suspicion element make all of that come alive. This beats battlestar for my collection.

Very disappointed with 1st game. A bad purchase?

Why was I disappointed? 

It felt more like I was playing with plastic figurines than being transported mind and body to King Arthur´s Camelot. The game felt simplistic and contrived, probably because you have no freedom in driving the story, you must follow the script set before you.

We shall see next time... if there will be a next time.

Awesome Game.  With the traitor--a very social and fun group think game.  Great Strategy elements as well for the strategy gamer.  Good for 4+ players IMO. Kudos for originality, fun factor and beautiful quality game.  Can't Go wrong.  On the downside you may get stuck on a certain quest the whole game (such as the grail) because it makes tactical sense to help the knights--but some games may be BORING if this happens to you.

I enjoyed it the first 3-4 times I played it, but it slowly got more boring with each play.

The bluffing mechanism was great, but the rest of the game just seemed too carry on a bit too long before the conclusion of the game.

An interesting game; the cooperative element is neat, as is the traitor thing, but the game itself is too simple to support repeat playings. The roleplaying aspect of the game is fun, but not really fun enough - I always felt like we had to 'fun it up' with the roleplaying, and that the game itself wasn't really pulling its weight. After three sessions, I doubt our play group will be getting this one out again soon.

Stricken between a 6 and 7, this game is decent. Downtime can be a bit high between turns, but the theme comes through. I don't honestly think there's much "game" or mechanically interesting things to do, but the gameplay is okay. I really dislike some of the design choices in this game - players are incentivized to NOT complete certain quests and just keep them in limbo lest the black deck's cards' effects start stockpiling catapults. I think that's a poor design choice, and I wonder if it was intentional for that to change the traditional strategy to this game so.

Play: 2 ish

Played 4 times. With 5, it was pretty difficult even without traitor. With 7, the game is significantly easier to beat.Problem is that most decisions are pretty trivial. You know you never go for dragons and always go for holy grills. Seems unbalanced. Also downtime is significant. Once you are involved in quest, you just play obvious cards for next 20 minutes.... sigh.After all, every game seems same and there are no replayaability to it.I much prefer LOTR which I still enjoy playing a lot.

The Knights and their special powers are NOT created equal, multiple black cards of the same type getting clumped together in the draw pile is disastrous, special black cards not being evenly spaced out is even worse, and the eight-sided die that came with my copy rolls sevens and eights with astounding frequency.  None of this changes the fact that the game is a blast to play.  The forces of good and evil both make progress on every turn, which makes SOC immensely superior to the Lord of the Rings co-op game with its damnable stack of good and bad tiles.

Very interesting concept, where the players work together to defeat the game.  We found our first three-player game (with no traitor) to be VERY difficult to win.  We simply didn't have enough options between us and faced a lot of setbacks.  I think this challenge is actually a good thing if you are playing with highly cooperative players who have a little experience with the game.  Probably not a great game for people who like to analyze everything every turn, because it leads to too much downtime for everyone else.

Fun to play many times, but with less than 5 the traitor does not work well in our experience. Once you play a few games it becomes easy to win without a traitor. If there is a traitor with less than 5 then you have almost no chance of winning (unless you are the traitor). I also do not like that catapults come out after completing the grail and excalibur quests. I realize this makes the game more balanced, but catapults are so hard to destroy it is as if it would be silly to beat those two quests. 

Despite the flaws this is one of our favorite and most played games, the game play is engaging and devising a strategy is fun. Also the artwork and theme are really cool.

RATING: 3
The game definitely works, and it is certainly accessible to non-gamers.  That said, when I'm picking games to bring to an outing I keep passing this one up after only three plays.---update---Degraded to a 5.  This is a cardgame posing as a boardgame.  Not a very compelling cardgame at that.  The traitor idea is neat, but I'd rather play werewolf.  The fighting back evil forces that come from the deck is neat, but I'd rather play Knizia's Lord of the Rings.  Figuring out how to cooperate in the best possible fashion is neat, but again I'd rather play Knizia's Lord of the Rings.  The components are beautiful, as we've come to expect from DoW, but this one is all sizzle and no steak.  The options on your turn are way too restrictive, which makes the game artificially tight.

---update---
down to a 3.  There is a fine basic system but there just isn't enough here to make me want to play this again.

Take on the role of a knight of the round table in this mostly cooperative game... with the possibility of a secret traitor in your midst.  The decisions to be made aren't too interesting and the social deduction doesn't actually add much to the game most of the time, but with a little light hearted role playing it's pretty fun.

Truly a great design, not just one of your usual "why don't we call this solitaire puzzle a co-op, maybe we can shift more copies by riding the hype" type of rip-off that saturates the market these days. You also don't grow a beard before it's over like in BSG and much more accessible, too.

Game looks gorgeous, component quality is fantastic, theme is very well done. A lesson in contemporary game design.

When I bought this in 2005, I rated this a 10 as it was my first co-op game. The concept was completely new and the traitor mechanic was very exciting. The luster wore off quickly as I realized it was just poker with a traitor mechanic and lots of pretty pictures. Will still play with 5 or 6 if the group is into it.

e: Yeah, no, I'll never play it again.

Role playing just doesn't seem to suit me.  

I liked this better than Arkam Horror, but the reality is I'd only play this if a group were into it.  I found that I have the most fun in RPG, when I just really get into the roles, speak with an accent, act up, and crack jokes.  With the right group, the social aspect can be fun.

After botching up the 1st 2 games of Shadows Over Camelot, we all decided that the game was nothing special. No matter where you go on the board, you're pretty much doing the same thing. Never tried it with a traitor, but I never like those kind of 'suspicion' games anyway. Don't know what else to say. Um, pretty components? The game was just okay.

The knights of the round are trying to complete different quests, which are essentially playing cards, one at a time, in poker hands on the board.  The game moves slowly and it never feels like the knights get ahead.  The traitor aspect is nice, but not enough to make this co-op much fun for me.

The game is not as predictable as reviews lead on if played with 5 or 6 players: 7 makes it too easy for the knights w/o squire rules, 4 or 3 makes it too easy for the traitor.  I'm a BIG fan and after countless plays, this game's strategy still seems fluid enough not to drag play, although I still haven't seen a knight attempt the Black Knight.

Also, like Settlers, Shadows is a great gateway game.  Maybe it's the acronym.

The problem?  BSG exists.  And for a gamer posse, it's simply a better 5-6 player "traitor" game.  It has completely replaced Shadows as the coop-minus game of choice in our group.  But it's perfect for younger audiences like my nephews, and it's a great intro to coop-minus-one games.

Has the most common broken game mechanic out there -- limited communication. You can't say what the number is, but you can talk about it vaguely. Anybody who isn't an idiot can figure out exactly what you are saying and the only way to fix it is to never communicate which makes the game too hard. We were playing with expansion cards and the game was over shortly after we got our first white sword. It turns out there is a card that draws two siege engines. I guess it was funny that we all thought everyone was the traitor even though there was no traitor.  If a group is looking for a game that is basically the opposite of fun (where everyone loses badly and quickly while yelling at eachother) this is a great game. Despite this, I'd play it again -- its very fast and entertaining in a Walking Dead / everyone you love will die sort of way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Semi-co-operative game. It suffers a little bit in comparison to Battlestar Galactica; considerably less paranoia and more teamwork.

I would usually rather play BSG, although this is a little better to teach to newbies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This a good cooperative game with a twist. If you play with the traitor, you can never be sure when you're going to be stabbed. It seems like it's best to concentrate on one or two goals at a time, since spreading yourself too thin accomplishes nothing. There seems to be a fairly standard way to beat this, so it might get dull after too many plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.45
The components are top notch, Days of wonder style. Thick cardboard, nice illustrations, miniatures... the best of the best.

The traitor/loyalty idea has been adopted by many later games, some of them very recent and popular (Dead of Winter and Battlestar Galactica), and I cannot say it's been improved a lot since then. In SoC though, the traitor must do his best not to be discovered, because his ability to influence the game will be much more limited (and boring) when operating from the open. But I cannot say this is a flaw of the game, it just forces the traitor not to try his luck too much.

Time has been kind with this title. It still plays nice and it's a good option for a cooperative,maybe not as good as others, but it's much shorter. 

Like most others in its genre, it's not really scalable (5-7 players) and time between turns feels a bit long. Also, its mechanisms are a bit too easy to master and I'm afraid it's not going to be very replayable for veteran gamers.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Every time I play this game it is usually with a new group of people, so for ease of teaching I have not yet had a chance to play with the traitor rules.  Still, it's a good game to play for the people who like their gameplay cooperative and not ridiculously hard like Ghost Stories.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My feelings about this game are a bit mixed. It's a bit long game played with 6-7 people. It's been fun every time though. Even with traitor-element it is mostly only a good social playing ground more than a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A mess of a game, where none of the pieces (quests) seem to mesh with one another. Overwrought and over-rated. I really do not see what the big deal with this game is. If it were not for its theme it would have next to no appeal to me. This was a game I really wanted to like, but it fell very flat. With only a couple of tweaks to the game's rules would this a much better game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very good cooperative game with absolutely gorgeous components and artwork.

The endgame is often quite disappointing, you just keep drawing black cards until the Round Table is filled with swords. Also, feels too easy with seven players but is reasonably tough with fewer players, especially when a traitor is present.

I wonder about replayability, though. This might get stale if played very often. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Co-operation as it should be. The players are doomed if they don't work well together. The possibility that one player is traitor is essential for the athmospere. Theme is nice and bits and pieces of high quality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
For trade: like new.  Played twice.

Super high quality components (typical Days of Wonder style), lost in an abstract masquerading as a thematic game.

Admittedly, I have only played this game twice, and both times without the traitor.  However, understanding how the mechanics work, it seems highly unlikely a traitor could go undiscovered for very long (assuming they actually do anything to thwart the rest of the players.)

Frankly, the game is hard enough to beat without the traitor.

A very similarly styled game: Battlestar Gallactica.

Whereas BG has a spot-on theme, great mechanics, and a superb implementation of the traitor mechanic, SoC has a pasted-on theme and mostly weak mechanics.

Cooperative game with beautiful boards and components. Like any coop game I feel it might lack long term replayability, but the traitor adds a nice element. I have yet to play the traitor.

E' un collaborativo, dove bluff e doppio gioco (nella versione con in traditore) la fanno da padrone. Io non sono un amante di questo tipo di gioco, e quindi alla fine mi annoio un po', anche le eventuali vittorie non regalano la classica soddisfazione. Più si è e più è bello.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The collaborative element is a winner. Perfectly playable with two (take two or three knights each, natch), and easy enough - despite the imposing appearance - to teach granny. Gorgeous, gorgeous art work in all elements of the game. Those complaining about the general shallowness need to lighten up and bring a bit more RPG to the cause, as hinted at by the manual! 

Upgraded again after it proved to have more legs than Pandemic. Probably the only co-op I really need to own.

Great game. Cool theme. I love all the bits. It's a fantastic game to invite a bunch of non-gamers to play - which is exactly what I do with it. It's cooperative so people don't feel like they have to think to hard, but they do anyway so they don't let down the group. We're now 0-2 when we play with a traitor, although this last one was REALLY close.

Played with the OKC group who claimed they never lose. I was the traitor and won. I've still yet to see the knights defeat the game when there's a traitor!

Amazing mechanics. Plays relatively fast and has great flow. Cathala is a genius when it comes to taking preexisting archetypes and re-imagining them in an important and fresh way. The card play keeps the game simple to play and teach, but the theme doesn't necessarily suffer from that. As a team you feel like you are running around the board putting out as many fires as possible, all the while knowing that someone might be sabotaging all the hard work.

Do I feel like King Arthur? Probably not. 

Do I feel the tension, the camaraderie, and the inevitable  triumph/defeat of our team? Absolutely.

So if you have played games like Dead of winter and Battle star Galactica.

I for one find this game to be a lot of fun with or with out the traitor issues.

This is Awesome! I haven't played a cooperative game yet I didn't like! You know I never have gotten into the Camelot/Medieval type theme...ever! But this game has done just that and more! This game is great for 2-players, but only gets better with more! When you get a good game going and the traitor aspect of the game comes into play...that's when this game really shines! It took us awhile to get to a really good game like that...I think that was due to us teaching the game to new groups of people! You are a knight at the round table or even King Arthur himself! You must go on quests to help retrieve Excalibur, the Holy Grail, special armor, defeat the Saxons or Picts, etc. all before time runs out. Every battle won means a white sword on the round table, every battle lost means a black sword...booo...unless you are the traitor that is! 

So far this game seems to take the same pattern of event play (i.e. Excalibur, then grail, then whatever other quest until you win...or lose)! I hope this isn't true...will play more and see!

An okay co-op plus traitor game, though Battlestar Galactica does it better. BSG fired Shadows before I even owned Shadows.

Also I fear SoC may be scripted and thus less replayable. Your decision set is highly constrained by your cards and where you are. Moving around is extremely inefficient.

I think this was my first co-op + hidden traiter game. I like Battlestar Galactica a lot lot more than this, although it is a lovely game. The major difference between this and BSG is that calling out the traitor is a gameplay option with real consequences: if you're wrong, you get screwed. The strength and weakness of the BSG system is that you have to out yourself as a traitor, and everyone else can just make assertions. (Obviously that changed with the introduction of executions in BSG.) Aaaanyway, Shadows is pretty nice. Dunno when I'd ever choose it over it's prettier younger sister though.

It's not exactly a thinking man's game, playing cards out in order, together or separate. But the traitor meta-game is always good fun, and the discussions around best path are entertaining. It has the advantage of playing with 6 or 7, hard numbers to find a good game for without splitting up.

This game is just awesome, it is seldom a weekend at which this game doesn't come on the table. This game is mainly a psychological defiance. You don't know whether there is or not a traitor in the game, and this uncertainty is what makes this game what it is. In fact, the traitor (if in game) can't do that much more harm then any other player could, what is important to the traitor is doing certain actions at the most critical times. But the simple fact of uncertainty makes all players somehow play in a very enclosed way, always analysing each other trying to detect the traitor among them. And if one of the players should make a wrong move accidentally, it immediately triggers the "side look" syndrome on other players. He may not be the traitor, but one wrong move was enough... so, despite being a cooperative game.. it's not as linear as that.. you need to try it to get it. So... please do when you get the chance.

Decent co-op game, though after enough plays the strategy is well known.  Most games now end up with more than enough white swords, with the players simply attacking siege engines until a few neglected quests end (as the black swords won't do enough damage to cost the game.)

So the first time I played it I joined in the middle of a game at a casual event concert. Very cool. However I must say that the TRAITOR MECHANIC RUINS THIS GAME. I would much rather play this game without a traitor; it's hard enough as it is. As a traitor it's very easy to win with just dumping a siege engine after every player's turn and it's so resource intensive to just fend them off it becomes very unfun when that happens. With no traitor I give 7. Without I give 5. So I'll officially leave a 6.

One of my favourite games ever! Its hard and with a Traitor element especially if that Traitor knows how to play and waits for the right moment to mess things up for everyone else it will be a blast.

One of the best artworks I have seen ever in a game along with Archipelago and Cyclades. The Arthurian theme is one of the best themes for me since I grew up playing Stronghold and Stronghold Legends and it captures it beautifully. 

Elements are cool everyone against the game which is really hard and harsh to the players but here is the fun part the game is co-op and all the knights are trying  their best to win the game or do they? But one of theme is secretly a traitor who works for Mordred and his dark forces. And no one knows who the traitor is and this adds so much mistrust between the players and soo much fun and replay value since you never know if there is a traitor or there is no traitor at all.

10/10 A must have for any game group out there!

My first coop, and still a highly respected one.  Shorter than battlestar (good), hidden traitor (good), lots of fun (good), a bit too much groupthink sometimes (not so good).  Still very much fun, and I finally got to play the traitor (I smoked 'em!).  After our last play, though, I'm not sure we'll play again for a while.  Traitor got so owned.

RATING: 8
  That`s a very nice game, full of Arthurian flavour. It plays a bit like a RPG so it needs right people to work properly. Wrong players can easly spoil the whole fun and atmosphere. I sold it mainly because of lack right company to play with. Pity.
  So it`s a very good game but only for people who can forget a bit about the mechanism of the game and set on role-playing.

Great initial game.  1st game we played without option of a traitor & we won (but it was close).  Good co-operative game.  You need to be playing strategically and co-operatively to win. Excellent production value. Beautiful components. 

On third game we played with traitor option, but through luck, it turned out no one was the traitor (6 players). 2 people were accused however and that definately had an impact on play (negatively). I really want to play with an actual traitor to see how that impacts this game!

Subsequent plays could definately increase this score.

A nice cooperative game in the vein of "Lord of the Rings"

It's good for a co-op, but that's not saying too much.  Really fun, once or twice.  Then one or two players basically end up running the whole game for everybody.  And the traitor should never lose.  Everyone wants to be a sneaky traitor.  Instead be a cruel horrible traitor.  I want to be traitor.

While not neccesarily highly strategic, and indeed a difficult game to beat (especially with a traitor involved), I give this game a high rating for its fantastic level of interactivity and the deep immersion into its theme.

RATING: 7
Un gioco divertente e molto ben fatto: ha i punti forti di Arkham Horror (il gioco in cooperativa) senza i difetti (una certa pesantezza delle regole) e con una ciliegina (l'infame che rema contro). C'è sempre il dubbio che chi compie una scelta sbagliata non lo faccia per distrazione, ma perché è la mela marcia. Si è sempre frenati dall'aiutare i compagni, temendo di avvantaggiare il traditore. E si dubita di ogni mossa altrui. Il gioco permette alla mela marcia di fare danni passando da eroe. Eccezionali gli ultimi turni, quando le azioni di tutti i cavalieri vengono passate al setaccio, in un crescendo di paranoia. Se si fa finta di non di sentire l'odore di astratto salire da sotto le illustrazioni medievali, e si ha la compagnia giusta è un gran gioco. Come genere cooperativo c'è di meglio in giro, ma rimane comunque un bel gioco.

My enjoyment of this design grows with each playing. The "traitor" aspect makes this game shine, regardless of the number of players (I've now played with 3, 4, 5, and 6). On several occasions victory seemed out of our grasp, but we were able to pull out a win in the last moments. Great game. (Although a traitor in your midst almost always spells defeat.)

Once you figure out how to beat the system, it's less of a challenge. The only real game to be played is for the player who's the traitor. The other players more or less play on automatic pilot.

In our group, the traitor only has managed to win only once. Maybe the game doesn't really work for us, but as a result, we don't see it as a real challenge. But it's fun!

This is one of my favorite games. It is usually quite fun, but a bad group of players can make the game really difficult. People who do sub-optimal plays and refuse to listen to the group can cause misdirected suspision and cause incorrect accusations of trechery. If players are not good at working as a team, then they shouldn't play this one. No one will have any fun. On the flip side, this game can be really easy with strong players and no traitor. This game also has a good deal or shiny pieces and great art.

I'm not a huge fan of cooperative games, and like most of the genre, this one is way too hard, even without someone trying to sabotage your efforts.  Even completing quests is often negative, because then cards related to that quest that are drawn become even more deadly.  The prohibition on sharing information about cards is really hard to enforce, as people gave clues that essentially gave it away.  The components in the game are absolutely fantastic, I'd be hard-pressed to think of a game that is more visually appealing.

My only real quibble with the game would be the vague 'what are we allowed to say' rules.  It seemed like we were always trying to make judgement calls on what sort of information could be allowed.

I expect this score would drop with repeated playings, but for now I can hardly wait to play it again!

I thought I'd be more impressed with the game. The theme was more than awesome, the game included great figures and nice artwork. My problem was that this is made to be too analytical. With awesome theme like this, current mechanics didn't support the storytelling side enough. The gameplay was WAY too mechanical. 

Too bad that this was such a mediocre experience, since not enough games are made of this theme. Well, the mechanics weren't bad, only quite repetitive and predictable. Few special action cards won't help in this...

One of my favorite games with easy rules and very approachable, particularly as traitor mechanic is optional (although game will not reach full potential without it). Beautiful game with excellent components. Different abilities allow players to contribute in different ways. Recommend playing without traitor until group is familiar with rules and mechanics otherwise, an inexperienced player may be confused for a traitor and affect overall enjoyment. Good theme, but not applied too heavily. Quests are solved essentially by playing sets of cards, so easy to understand, but may be thematically disappointing to some for its abstract mechanic. No walk in the park, but probably easier to win than Pandemic (and the traitor will win if the players lose, so there's always that.)

Possibly THE best cooperative game to play with children.  Teaches teamwork, strategy, goalsetting and even has a traitor element to help with deduction and motivation.  It is not surprising I find this to be one of the best family games out there.  Only (mild) weakness to this game is a lack of depth for those of us that need our brain burner meds on an IV drip.  With kids, it is just the right amount.  And if you are that bored, just deal yourself the traitor card ;P

First time we played, King Arthur was the traitor- which was hilarious.

I liked our first play of this cooperative game, which has King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table heading off on quests and defending Camelot, which is under seige. Like many co-ops, this appears to be easier to defeat with more players.... with three it seemed very difficult to keep up with quests.

I'm looking forward to trying the traitor mechanic too, which will make the game even harder.

Co-op with what seems like a cool theme.  To be honest, the theme falls pretty shallow to me.  This game feels more multiple puzzles going on simultaneously.

I also enjoy the traitor mechanic although I think it is done better in Dead of Winter.  My wife doesn't care for traitor mechanics so I don't get to play this often.

A great cooperative game that is easy to learn and quick to play.  Anyone could like this game, as long as you have someone to teach it to you.  After a few more plays of this game, I still really like it, but it's harder than expected to get new people to like it.  There's something about the reading of the cards and the lack of action that just doesn't hold the attention.  The traitor is the "hook" that makes the game work.  Still, it can be a little predictable sometimes.  I think the game could use one more good "hook".  I hear there's an expansion in the works . . .

RATING: 8
A great game with 4+ Players and a good co-operative mechanic that builds real tension. You realise quickly that every action counts.

Can be played solo but this eliminates the traitor which kind of helps with the tension.

Plays in about an hour and not for dummies so you probably want Adults playing. I like the Camelot theme and the artwork and production quality of the components inspired me to paint them.

A great game for great company.

Might as well just play rummy and save yourself some money. Yes, it's very much a card game in disguise. That doesn't make it a bad game but it loses a lot of points for being dishonest for the sole reason of a higher price tag.

It also comes with lots of quality plastic figures that are all useless. Every single one of them could have easily been represented by a token piece.

Bon jeu coopératif où les joueurs doivent apprendre à se mettre d'accord. Cependant un algorithme existe. Une fois trouvé, la partie se gagne assez facilement. Il est temps alors d'introduire un félon pour mettre un peu de piquant.

Very nice (mostly) collaborative game.  Played with 7, the good guys seemed to win easily, but it would clearly be more of a challenge with fewer players.

RATING: 8
Fine game that requires different strategies with different numbers of people.  There are some balance issues, I believe.  With skilled players, the traitor has little chance in 7 player games and probably has a great chance of winning in a 4-player game.  Regardless, I always have fun playing this one, and I suspect the "squire" rules help in making the quests more difficult in bigger groups (as Alexfrog has mentioned).

It's interesting to me that I like this game, since Battlestar Galactica fell flat for me.  I really enjoy the cooperative elements of the game, and the various quests that can be completed.  I also very much enjoy the fact that the traitor is a lot easier to mask than in BSG.  In fact, you may not have a traitor at all.  That uncertainty adds something for me that was lacking in BSG.

A lot to learn for a first time player, but I really liked this game's atmosphere. While it may get a little "old" after multiple plays, who cares when the game looks this good. [Update: 2nd playing of the game didn't change my opinion. I still had hard time grasping all unique special powers of each character. And game is just too long.]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Tense, difficult co-op game that has the thrills of BSG but at only 90 minutes. Sure the card poker mechanic isn't as thematic as cylons and attacking starships, but Camelot is easier to grasp and has gorgeous artwork and components. 

Plus it's short length means it will get to the table more often. So it scratches that traitor-cooperative game itch and is generally more satisfying than The Resistance, Saboteur, Werewolf. So certainly a game worth trying. Have to try Dark Moon and see how it compares to this and it also offers that much-wanted BSG fun under 2hrs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice and very simple coop. The traitor mechanic feels nice, but I think this works better in games like "Battlestar Galactica". The role of the traitor after the mid game can be very limited. A good thing about this game is that it will easily fit 8 players, without them dying of boredom between turns, since the mechanics of each turn are so simple.

Mixed feelings about this one. There are elements of it that I really enjoy; the traitor mechanic, and the fact that it supports many players, with people essentially able to join and leave on the fly. It almost feels a little analytical, though, and the play of the game really depends on finding a good balance of table talk, as players talking openly about which cards they have and need takes all of the challenge out of it. Also has nice bits, board and box, though once assembled, it seems that the lid ot the box doesn't close when everything's inside.

An unusual card-driven cooperative boardgame.  Best with five or more players; and I'd reccommend not using the traitor for the first few games.  On the one hand, there are some mechanics that still concern me, such as the preponderance of seige engines after you snag Excalibur.  And it's crucial that the group observe the communication rules, otherwise the game is far too easy.  But I gotta admit, the enthusiam my family shows for this game is undeniable.

RATING: 8
A fun co-op game that is still challenging after 3 plays. One was a fairly easy win, but the others were losses where the order of the black cards had the loyal knights juggling resources and quests, trying to keep a step ahead of evil...and failing. Update: The squire rules have kept this one hitting the table after we had gotten adept at winning with 7 knights. This ability to increase the difficulty should keep the replayability up.

Repeated plays have caused the ratings to rise.  This game has a lot of tension...the constant suspicion and mistrust of allies, the uncertainty of the results of your efforts over time, the several different end-game clocks you have to juggle...good stuff.  Not a deeply strategic game, but an unusual and tense one.

Wow, great game for a lot of people and very accessible to new gamers.  I gotta admit, I like my gaming sessions to be more fun than mentally damaging, and this one's great for that.  Plus, there's a lot of interaction when there's a traitor about!  A great game, love that it can sit 7 (now 8!) and it still doesn't have to too long to play.  Very pleased to own it.

Also, Merlin's company I think will help make it more balanced and less dependent on total player control of each other.

Beautiful cooperative game. High production quality. Needs a high number of people to play, or it will be very hard or unfun; it does have some balance issues. Playing Shadows over Camelot is a fun, and (with the traitor) often tense experience, but I feel it lacks depth and replayability and feels mechanical without offering interesting choices. It also often takes too long, and the game can drag when you reach the endgame.

Shadows over Camelot is probably a good game for a large group, with non-gamers, who might be engaged enough with all the social interaction going on, and aren't as bothered by the lack of choices and variety. But, the rules can be quite overwhelming on your first play, so I don't think it will be succesful as a gateway game. You might as well play werewolf.

The traitor is a brilliant idea, that could have been implemented a lot better. And it's the game's only highlight (ok, I enjoy the fact that it's non-linear too). The games of Shadows I played were fun, but when I'm in the mood for a coop game (not that often), I can't see myself picking Shadows over games with a more immersive feeling.

Several plays in and you can definitely see the bones of Knizia's Lord of the Rings co-op game underneath all the chrome/armour. I appreciate that the traitor element really provides the social fun which LOTR lacks, but SoC has some chinks when I compare both designs. The most noticeably thing is how textual in rules explanation and execution in Camelot, whereas Knizia has stripped his design almost bare, which I'm all for, for pace sake. Already after the first game, knights were already discussing some short term strategy, where as the hobbit's life involves more long term planning and thought; and with LOTR you can finish the game once someone is eliminated. Played mostly 4 player sessions which feels about right, 5 players would be a stretch turn based wise I think though I would like to try 3 player.

This is an entertaining cooperative game with the twist that one of the Knights could be a traitor. This feature makes the game much more interesting, adds tension by making the players suspicious of one another and keeping them guessing whether there is a traitor and if yes, who?

I'm not particularly fond of cooperative games, so I'm being very generous with a 5. I'm yet to play Lord of the Rings.

This game was ok for the first two thirds of the game, but the instant that the traitor was named, the game seemed to really die out.  It felt very repetitive and I immediately realized the terrible win condition that we only needed to collect 7 white swords and then defend the castle indefinitely, which is what was done.  Will not bring this game to the table again, but I'm not a huge fan of strictly co-op games anyway.

Admittedly, it IS strange using a full house to defeat Lancelot, the game works pretty well and is not necessarily easy.  That said, I do agree that most cooperative games put people in a weird group-think, and it isn't as satisfying to 'win'.

The cooperation required to beat the game makes this the most interactive and social game I've ever played. The amount of colaboration means that there is virtually no down time because everybody gets to throw in their 2 cents on every move.  Of course the spectre of the traitor is what makes the game re-playable. 

The only downside is that while the game is fairly straigh-forward, there are lots of little rules that could make some non-gamers go into convulsions. A must have.

Thought it was okay at first, but after one play, we pretty much "solved" the game.  It isn't particularly difficult, especially with five or more players.  The traitor mechanism seems a little tacked on and counter to the theme (King Arthur is a traitor?  Uh, alright). 
That said, it was fun while it lasted.  If my group ever needs an ego boost, I'll whip this out and we can stomp its guts with minimal effort, and then move on to something more challenging.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Can be quite slow since you frequently know what you're doing for a number of turns in advance (e.g. Black Knight quest). Overall, it requires a group really willing to get into the theme. If even one player plays it as a mechanical game, it tends to spoil the fun for everyone. In that sense, it's a tough game to find the right group for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
My favorite co-op game. Every other one I have tried or own misses the element I think makes this one the best: Personal reward and gain. Your knight personally gains from solving quests, and you can even receive great items as rewards. This causes a lot of treachery, even when we know there isn't a traitor.

There may not be a lot depth to this game, but who cares!  There are still plenty of tough choices, and it makes for a very tense gaming experience.  Of course, what really makes the game is the traitor element.  This lends a feeling of paranoia to any loyal players, who will be scrutinizing everybody else's moves for any hint of treachery.  On the other hand, playing the traitor well is definitely a challenge and requires a lot of subtlety.

Players take on the role of knights at the round table and aim to keep Camelot secure from the Pict and Saxon attacks while embarking on quests to defeat the Black Knight, capture Lancelot's armour, The Holy Grail, and Excalibur, all of which endow the knights with special powers. 

Like other Days of Wonder productions, Shadows over Camelot has a high production value with a brilliant game board and detailed miniatures.

A game that moves smoothly even with seven players, everyone contributes to the game, and player turns aren't very long, and the whole game only takes around 1.5 hours even with 7 players with half of them new to the game.

This used to be THE GAME I wanted to play more than any other. Then I read about how it was 'broken' and cooled on it. That was dumb of me, because after finally playing it, it's perfectly fine. For the first third of the game, it looked like we were going to steamroll the forces of darkness. Two incorrect accusations later, the second third of the game consisted entirely of evil kicking us in the face over and over. It looked bleak through the final third of the game, at which point we barely held on, and it all came down to picking out the traitor.

We got him.

That was a great session.

Liked it when it first came out, but it soured quickly.  Being the traitor and winning as the traitor made me feel like a jerk.  Of course, if you enjoy being a jerk, you might like this.  Much better if you play without the traitor.

Fun coop game. The balance is really very good considering all the different quests and other variables that are in the game. If its too easy, you can also easily just start with a few more "bad" cards. The traitor makes the game a lot of fun with a bigger group.

Played this one a few times and enjoyed it, but find Dead of Winter to be a game better suited to my preferences. Still this is a bit better for those looking for a bit lighter and easier of an experience. Feels like the traitor has a difficult time in this one, but that is just my thought on limited plays, so may well be wrong.

SoC was my gateway game and it really got me hooked on boardgaming. I thoroughly enjoy the cooperative aspect of the game, which is very refreshing. 

This is always the first game that I bring out to play with non-gamers, and I have always received positive feedback about it. SoC has also gotten me looking for more cooperative games to play (Pandemic, anyone?)

11/01/2013: Lowered rating to 6 as it doesn't grab me as much anymore. Good introduction game to demonstrate cooperative gameplay mechanic, but I do find that the gameplay gets pretty boring after a while.

RATING: 9
Awesome cooperative/traitor game. I love the theme and I think it works well with the game. There is no downtime, considering this plays with up t 8 players. I am yet to play the expansion and reckon this might climb up to a 10. One thing I am not sure of is to what extent the traitor can do stuff to influence the game apart from remaining hidden, as compared to BSG for example. There is always one more thing to do than you can and the game is both exciting and tense. I like it.

EDIT: Played it four times in a short time now and while I still think this does not deserve to sit in the back of gamers' shelves just because of BSG, it does not hold up all too well after multiple plays within a short period of time. The traitor's options are too limited and so are the knights, in my opinion. Also, the game is too easy to win (Yes, I would like to try the expansion).

This game is awesome. I love cooperative games, and this one is cooperative -- but with a traitor twist. It's always fun to see how people react to being the traitor, and it's fun to play because there is so much happening on the board and so many different fronts that need to be managed that it's easy to sabotage. On the other hand, when you aren't a traitor, it's still fun because things always feel as if they are on the brink of spinning out of control, and it takes a lot of group planning to figure out how to best approach the problem -- especially since you can't directly talk about what you're going to do. Love it.

This game is okay, but if I am playing a traitor game I'd rather play BSG. There isn't enough for the traitor to do to actively hurt the rest of the players.

Great for the interaction and the possibility of a betrayal.  Keeps the game fresh with the right people.  I can see other people not liking this if you played with mostly quiet people as you'd be basically playing rummy and poker against another deck.  The communication is great to prevent the alpha player from taking over, which is what I hate on coop games. There are some fiddly rules,  but it's one of my favorite games

RATING: 7
A very interesting dynamic in that this is a cooperative boardgame.  Lots of player interaction but in a way that is very tense for everyone involved... especially if you have a lot of type "A" personalities.  The theme is evoked primarily through magnificent art and player interaction more so than game mechanics.  In other words, most of the time, you ARE taken in with the theme... but the immersion is about 85% complete.  Sometimes there is a nagging realization that crops up where you are cognizant you are playing what is essentially a card game.  

But liked I said, the game has much tension (which is very surprising for a cooperative game) and most of the time you are well immersed in the theme.  The components are outstanding.

RATING: 9
Best game of 2005.

People say that they get tired of the game - well, it hasn't happened to me yet, and I can't see it happening either.  What you have is a neat co-operative "beat the system" game, and I can see how you could get tired of that.  But there's also a "Werewolf" type game running in parallel.  Even if you have a foolproof way to beat the game system (unlikely, due to the random card distribution in the decks), you still have to deal with the Werewolf - sorry, Traitor.

AND it's a really top-notch production.  The only citicism is the plastic box insert isn't perfect.  And since getting the oainted knights, I don;t have anywhere to store my Quest artifacts.

I've played this game over 50 times and have NOT ONCE played with the traitor. I love the idea of a traitor mechanism, and this was one of the first games to offer that feature. However, it is kind of flawed in its execution. The traitor seems to be more powerful if revealed and so it makes little sense to even try to hide the fact. WITHOUT the traitor the game can be hard enough and is easily modified with various starting health, optional "squire" phase, etc.

RATING: 5
A role playing game, without the creative freedom, in card form - with a board attached, so as to get a boardgame classification. Plenty of eye-candy to attract the bowerbirds of boardgame collectors.

Bowerbird:
1. any of various birds of the Australian region whose males build ornamented structures resembling bowers in order to attract females.
2. informal; chiefly Australian; a collector of unconsidered trifles.

Loving fantasy and medieval art, architecture, etc., I am a clear sucker for such themed games; however, the eye-candy in this game was not enough to make me wish to possess my own copy, let alone play it more than once or so per year once I actually got to sit down and play it.

The game can be fun, but it just takes too long. About 30 minutes of fun, 30 minutes of thinking, after which it starts to get tedious. Downtime can be a drag.

Perhaps my rating will go up when I play the game a few more times; then again, there is a possibility that the rating could go down each time I play it. I both like and dislike the game... a few more goes will decide the tilt of the scales.

RATING: 8
Very interesting game. The quality of the components is through the roof. Unfortunately, the gameplay suffers from balance problems, and too-limiting of options. There just aren't enough choices to make. LotR is a much stronger game from that standpoint. I think SoC's biggest flaw is that the Traitor has little ability to actually affect the outcome. It's so obvious if they are doing any unheroic actions, that even the Excalibur quest is suspicious.

Update: After a completely different play, the game impressed me with the menace the engine can provide, even with 7 players. It beat us with sub-optimal play even without much Traitor influence. It showed me that you have to be efficient to easily beat the game.
Raised score an entire point.

I absolutely love this game but my gaming group...not so much. What really drew me into the game was the theme. I really enjoy playing as one of the knights of the round table.

On the other hand, a few of my friends felt that they didn't have enough flexibility in the kind of actions they could make each turn. They actually ended up having their knight sit in the same spot and keep playing the same cards every turn; not a very satisfying experience for them.

To this day, I have not been able to see how this game plays with traitors because most groups I played with had trouble beating the game without traitors. I think that having that additional level of gameplay would break up the tedium of "I sit on the grail quest and keep playing grail cards every turn because we keep drawing evil grail cards".

Nice cooperative game with a little twist (traitor) that makes a huge difference. The potential traitor stirrs up the gameplay quite a bit and at least in our gaming groupe there are constant discussions who the traitor might be. Apart from that gameplay is basicaly card management. But it's tense to discuss the strategy and it is not so easy to win this game. But there are some people who find the gameplay totally boring since your actions are quite limited when you are at a quest: you simply lay a card down. I believe it is only interesting if you care about every move your comrades are doing and if you take part in the discussion what would be the best move next. If you don't care what's going on with the rest of the gang, it's boring.

The game does inspire some fun team interaction as everyone (except perhaps a traitor) is playing against the board.

Yeah, it looks great. I was pretty excited to play it the first time, too, what with the cooperative play and the comparisons to Lord of the Rings. It's fun. Nice game for both youngies and euro hardcore. But there's just not enough to think about on your turn. Turn over a card, play a card. Stop. That's it! The traitor adds to the tension, but I just can't see my plays moving into double figures. I'll enjoy it while I can.

My enjoyment of the game is slowly declining. The first couple times you play, you are amazed with so many factors.

It's a cooperative game, it fits a lot of players, it has RPG elements, quests and rewards. The art is great and there's just a lot going on.

As you play it a lot however, the game becomes fairly mechanic. The traitor mechanic is the only redeeming part at this point.

Explaining this game to new players is a headache. The overall game is fairly simple: do a bad and a good action on your turn, 12+ swords with white a majority wins the game.

There's just too many side rules like, "if you leave a solo quest, the white cards disappear.", or "cards in the game must be discarded face down.". etc.

Very good game, now one of our group's regular go-to games.  Simple mechanics make it easy to learn and good for players of varying skill levels.

One oddity is that the game becomes much easier the more players there are.  Our four-player games, played without the traitor rule, were such difficult nail-biters that it seemed like adding a traitor would make things absolutely impossible.  But on our first 7-player game with a traitor, the good guys won handily.

An excellent cooperative game with great integration of the Arthurian Legend theme.  Game play and choices are limited.  The traitor element isn't as significant as Battlestar Galatica's cylons, nor the characters as distinct as the BSG characters.  A good change of pace from BSG, but aside from theme and being a little more co-op friendly (and far less paranoid), probably wouldn't be recommended over BSG unless the BSG player count wasn't right for a good game.  High-quality components.

's O.K.  The main game is really in deducing who the traitor is.  The rest of the play is largely dictated by events and cards in hand.  Sumptious bits don't really offset a thin theme.  The game offers very few decisions to the players beyond deducing the traitor.  Dull.

In Camelot, there are quests and actions the group needs to accomplish or the group will lose the game. This leads to experienced players essentially 'playing the game' for inexperienced players in the same way aggressive soccer moms re-live their childhoods through their children: it's just no fun for the person being controlled and, honestly, just bolstering the controller's dimentia.

SoC is mechanically bland, drags on too long and gives players very little true decision making. Traded away our copy to prevent in-fighting amongst the group and frustrating game nights.

I've always wondered at the expression that a game "takes too long for what it is". I mean, it is what it is, how can it possibly take too long?

Then I played Shadows over Camelot and came to understand. Played with a decent number of players this is two hours plus of assembling poker hands with the odd dice roll thrown in. It's great for about the first hour and bit, and then it starts feeling, well, too long for what it is.

RATING: 5
This is a nicely themed semi co-operative game with a lot of interesting stuff and a fun, tense endgame. But the problem is how it actually plays for the rest of the game.

It can easily last for 2+ hours. During that time you might find yourself just sitting in one location on the map discarding a card each turn. That can literally be almost everything you do, apart from discussion with players.

Other parts of the game are better, such as helping other players make decisions (albeit based on scant information) or trying to discern which players are traitors (ones with a secret goal to saboutage the others).

The game has fun moments and some surprises. There are plenty of interesting cards that make magical, heroic or awful things happen. It satisfyingly raises the tension towards the end of the game, when players invariably find themselves on the brink of disaster because of all the evil enemies emerging from the board.

I'm not happy with the co-operation system. It involves an essential - but VERY awkward - ruling that permits you to only *broadly* describe what you have in your hand of cards (which is hidden). It is very difficult to apply that rule consistently and it is very open to individual interpretation. Many players will try to hint heavily about what cards they have in order to help the group win. In our group certain supposedly vague phrases inadvertantly became code (i.e. "I can continue on this quest for A BIT longer" or "MUCH longer" or "I will have to stop VERY SOON" etc). That can get frustrating for a traitor player, whose chances of winning plummet if players share too much detail.

Other games have done a similar thing better. Even the arduous Battlestar Galactica is better, if you can stomach the way its deduction process involves a lot of memorising what colour cards people have played etc. Dead of Winter, though not a favourite of mine, is probably better.

Oddly, I still seem to have this game in my collection after many years. I think that's because it does one particular thing very well. It provides a slightly chaotic 'romp' through arthurian dilemmas, which is a very appealing thing.

Love the game.  Must have a group who is willing to play "in the spirit" of the game; if naturally Chivalrous, that's all the better!   Very easy to incorporate some optional rules to spice it up... with 4-player, we give each person randomly 2 cards (I have the 8th Knight) and let him pick which one to play.   Some of the variant quests people have added are unique and fun too.   We particularly like the HUNT FOR THE QUESTING BEAST, and have special rules making it Easier to work on that quest when there are LESS players in the game (less players = tougher for Knights to win).

One of my favorite game. It is a cooperative game so, that make for a different kind of game. The twist is that, one of you can be a traitor which is trying to make the others lose. Looking at the other, wondering if one of you is the traitor or not makes for a very interesting game!

Good coop game. Easy (enough) to explain to new players. Game is much better with a traitor, but advised to try with experienced players. Good measure of luck (or bad luck) keyed into the game, by the draw of shadow cards.

It's definitely NOT a silly place.  A serious and challenging coop game with a traitor where players try to save Camelot from various threats by completing different kinds of quests.

Honestly this is really nothing more than cooperative Rummy.  The theme is neat and the components and artwork are absolutely phenomenal.  But there is a disconnect between the mechanics of the game and what it is you're supposed to be doing.  What does collecting four sets of 3 cards have to do with slaying a dragon?  Lord of the Rings outshines this game in the sense that the gameplay mechanics are intimately tied to the theme.  A nice attempt, but ultimately I think this game is too abstract to have real lasting power.

Shadows over Camelot is amongst the very first co-operative games. Each player controls one of the Knights of the round tables, and must undertake various tests (which essentially consist of trying to assemble poker hands) while various timer mechanisms tick away to the final victory of the dark forces.
Yes, Pandemic is more elegant, and Battlestar Galactica does much the same thing but with knobs on. Despite that Shadows is a genuinely clever and involving game.

A very good cooperative game, that suffers from only one real drawback: the gameplay doesn't mesh with the story.  We're just moving to places and dropping cards.  We might as well be cavemen fighting dinosaurs, scuba divers fighting sharks, or aliens fighting godzilla.  The game mechanics don't mesh with the story at all.

That said, it's still quite a fun game, although the 'traitor' aspect sometimes puts people off.

(04/21/2008) - Got this today as another part of a buying spree on Pozy.com

(07/07/2008) - [8.5] - After playing two games of this today I am hooked. Anyone who thinks this game is only about making poker hands is sorely mistaken. The traitor mechanic is absolutely brilliant and is what really gives the game life. I have very minor concerns about replayability but doubt they will become an actual issue.

This had a higher rating, but with the introduction of so many more cooperative and hidden role games to the hobby, it has fallen a notch. Production values are incredible, theme is amazing, but setup, explanation of the different quests, and the chance of a new player getting the traitor and not knowing what to do makes this difficult to bring to the table. I will say the high player count and the fact that people can join mid-game do make this unique and will keep it in my collection.

RATING: 4
What I most enjoy about this is the ambiguity I can create in my behavior and gameplay. I spent the last session, where I was loyal, behaving erratically; this was in order to lay the groundwork for future rounds as the traitor. If they were so sure I was the traitor and they were proven wrong, will they be so quick to accuse me in the future?

A great, fun cooperative game. THe knights of the round table fight together against the advancing forces of evil to maintain the security of Camelot.

Loads of fun with the right crowd of people.

(+) The game can host many players and still keep everyone involved for the entire game time
(+) Beautiful artwork, very appealing game and theme
(+) Accessible game: you can play this with your family, your colleages, ... Also occasional players will be interested in this game
(+) The traitor mechanic is very well done, and it's this mechanic which makes the game truly shine
(+) Very high 'fun'-level in a game which still offers some strategic thinking and planning

(-) At the end, it boils down to drawing white and black cards. With luck, the order in which they are drawn raises the chances of the party of Camelot, otherwise they will have a hard to impossible time to defeat evil, no matter what the actions of the traiter might be
(-) With multiple players, the effect of the traitor gets 'dilluted'. Multiple traitors are required in such cases, but this will inevitably result in low chances of success to the party of Camelot, as single player quests do not scale well with the player count and defeating multiple traitors is quite an impossible task :)
(-) After multiple plays, my guess is it would become very hard for a vicious traitor to remain in the shadows. Still, this is a problem we haven't encountered yet, as loyal players often also tend to play a little... strange - always resulting in joyfully misty distrust and deceit

Pretty fun cooperative game with a traitor twist. It can get really metagame-y at times, and the ease in which alpha-gaming can take over the game can be a damper to the fun.

Rules (especially those pertaining to hiding information) can be relaxed a bit for a more casual, introductory experience; however, having a traitor negates this back into a tense experience.

Definitely will play; however, would be more prudent in which kind of group this is brought out to.

One of the finest cooperative games available, Shadows over Camelot both benefits and suffers from the limited scope given to a player's turn.

ok, maybe this game IS over produced. Maybe you can have the same game with a bunch of cards. And maybe you can grown tired of this game. I think I'll never disocover this issue, because I have so many games and so little time to play them.

And... hearing words such: "Yes, I can battle the Saxon but I think I won't be able to beat them AT ALL, maybe King Arthur can help me?", is too much fun!

SoC is a great game, but the game group has a strong impact on the fun you get. With the wrong people (=not nice) you will find it boring and rather unpleasing. It's a great cooperative game, and with a lot a player (6-7) there's the almost sure presence of the Traitor that spices it. Even if you have to struggle versus the game, you'll discover it is very difficult to win, and you'll have to do your best to overcome.

RATING: 5
Nice game for a larger group.  The addition of the traitor adds just a touch of spice to an otherwise cooperative game.  Players really need to play in character to avoid the excessive information sharing to help keep to the spirit of the game.

It's unclear to me that it's really all that fun to play the Traitor (which always seems to happen to me).  On the one hand, playing sub-optimally while trying to appear to be playing optimally is not easy to do, and if you're doing that, you're probably not playing badly enough to actually hurt the Knights' chances much.  If, on the other hand, you play badly enough and are suspected, it isn't in the Knights' interest to accuse you until the last possible instant, since unmasking the Traitor bestows considerable power upon him.

Add this to the list of cooperative games that still haven't achieved what I think cooperative games are capable of.

I tried it a second time, and it's ok. What I dislike is that the game takes too long to play. Quests take too long to complete, and I find that the game itself lacks a certain "spark" that makes it fun.

The special abilities of the knights are not all created equal -- it would have been nice if the specials were usable every turn, as opposed to triggering on (relatively rare) events.

There are better co-op games out there now. This is not worth a purchase.

Too mentally exhausting, I suffer from analysis paralysis while playing.  If you enjoy a feeling of despair while playing a game, you may enjoy this.  I enjoy other co-ops more.

Even when winning, which happens ~15% of the time, I just don't enjoy getting there.

Played once. Too bitty and didn't involve us - we did play without a traitor though by the luck of the draw - also we couldn't see that there was a sufficiently severe penalty for false accusations of betrayal in the early stages of the game so we all accused everyone else and that destroyed any 'tension'. No one has wanted to play it since.

Great co-operative game with stupendous components and theme, Shadows over Camelot is a boxload of fun.

I'm never usually a fan of cooperative games. Whenever I play them, I feel like I'm on cruise control or autopilot. Other people are making all the decisions for me, since they're more experienced in the game, or they just have a control fetish.
Nevertheless, I get the appeal behind cooperative games. So many frustrating Monopoly arguments from my childhood is living proof that sometimes conflict in games doesn't add to the experience, it destroys it.
Shadows over Camelot however doesn't feel like most cooperative games. You are your own person, I feel like, moving your dude around different quests while trying to help out your fellow Knights of the Round Table to stem the tide of evil.
It has quite a few good systems, and it doesn't just pan down to trading with your partners in order to finish all the tasks. Each person at the table will assume a specific role, no matter what, and each will contribute to finishing the game. Most likely in death, but whatever. Its still a fun game.

The right crowd helps a lot, but without the right crowd its painful. Most the time its just a painful excuse for pretty components to be called a game.

--10Jul2005-- Looks like a good game - after 4 plays in one week.  With us, seems a bit on the easy side for the Traitor.  Interesting to see how the rating holds up over time.
--Dec2006-- Not so well.  Down to 6.
--Dec2008-- Down to 5.
--Aug2010-- In fact, in retrospect, this game was the beginning of my current "always play before buy" rating for Days of Wonder games.  I bought this one because I'd really enjoyed the previous DoW offerings:  Pirates Cove & Mystery of the Abbey were cool silly fun things.   This one got several plays in a row, and we've carefully avoided it since.
--Aug2011-- Traded away.
--Jan2017-- And not missed at all.

This is a great game for a large group of players.  The traitor mechanic is great fun, and the components are awesome.  I am wondering how many times I will play though with out some type of variant quests.

**Update.  After a couple years now and several plays, I find this to be particularly boring.  The traitor mechanic is ok, but has since been improved upon by other games...   this one feels stale and scriptable.

I'm not a great fan of co-operation games and this is no exception - I often find the it feels a little like the game plays you.  It also seems that with 4 players that with a traitor it's impossible, without a traitor it's too easy.  I am playing it a lot, as others in the group like it, but it's never one I'd choose.

As I was looking over my games that I want to trade I noticed a small blemish on this game. I guess while it was sitting in its box for over 3 yrs, one of the side boards stuck to annother. As I tried to gently pull them apart I noticed some of the paper/print came off. It is very small and only on a side board, not the main board. Even though its on both sides you only see one side at a time. I have uploaded some pictures so you can see what I mean.

This game is great with large groups (5+ players) and gets better each time you play with the same people.  The bluffing element to the game really starts to shine when you’ve had experience playing with everyone at the table.

This game is fun for new players as well – the rules are easy to learn, and new players can sometimes be the most successful traitors.  (Your fellow knights will be asking themselves “Is he inexperienced or the traitor?”.)

A cut above Lord of the Rings as coop games go; there's more to do, players are less at the mercy of Lady Luck, and the Traitor is a wonderful mechanic.  (Though, admittedly, it's hard for the traitor to have a great effect without giving himself up, when there's a full table of 7 players.)  I'm still not convinced of the game's staying power, but I think if I don't play it more than once every month or so, it'll stay fresh.

I like the game, but it ranks this high because it is one of the best values for my game dollar that I have in my collection.  Everyone wants to play it, and it's provided hours of enjoyment.

My crowd has played about ten times now and is still learning about the game, and about each other.  The Traitor card adds a fascinating twist that keeps the game interesting even after you start figuring out how to win.

Fun times. I'm not too big on some of the individual powers and sometimes it feels like the traitor element was tacked on. Also, if you're the only traitor sometimes its hard waiting for your turn to come around if you're revealed. Other times questing for the grail is a big bitch and god knows trying to save Excalibur is a pain in the ass. Still, its challenging and a lot of fun.

RATING: 8
I love Days of Wonder games.  This one is a lot of fun even though we have figured out how to beat it practically every time, even when there is a traitor.  I suppose my gaming group should play with the optional "squire" rules to make it a bit tougher, but then we might all lose (except for the traitor).  

I don't have to think back too far when I played this for the first few times, when we lost horribly every game.  We played it several times over several weeks until we finally beat it.  We finally won for the first time when my little brother made some huge mistakes as the traitor by telling us he was the traitor.  He thought he had the card that revealed the traitor to the rest of the players detriment, but he was confused and had a different card (don't remember which anymore).  Anyway, because he let us know he was the traitor, and he didn't have the right card to reveal himself, we voted against him that very next turn and got a white sword.  We all teased him and told him that we couldn't have won without his help.  He got soooo mad.  It was hilarious.  OF course we had fun at his expense, but isn't that the point of overcoming the traitor?

This has ended up being eclipsed at its own game by Battlestar Galactica, but this is a better game for people who want a more straight cooperative experience, with a little bit of uncertainty thrown in with the traitor. Good family game, and lower complexity than BSG, but it lacks the depth of its younger brother.

*edit* After many years of never wanting to play this again, I recently landed another copy in a trade and was surprised to discover that after all these years, Shadows Over Camelot still holds up pretty well. There is a dearth of family-style traitor games, but Shadows Over Camelot fills that spot quite well. There's enough narrative detail to enjoy it, but the gameplay from turn to turn is very simple and straightforward. Battlestar Galactica is still the better, more engaging game, but as BSG's less relevant license and situational greatness become liabilities, Shadows Over Camelot shows its quality all the more.

If you are the traitor (I was it two times) it's fun. But I have the assumption that every game could proceed in the more or less same way. It's too scripted I think and that's what makes this game boring if you play it a lot. You can't do a lot of things.

A játékban a kerekasztal lovagjainak bőrébe bújva kell felvenni a harcot Camelot sötét erőivel. Ebből eredően a játék kooperatív. Pontosan csak részben mert nem minden lovag lojális az igaz ügyhöz. 
A játékot 7 lovag tudja játszani (köztük Artúr király). Minden lovagnak van speciális képessége mely egyedibbé teszi a játékosok körét. Igaz kisebb létszámnál is élvezhető de 7 játékosnál igazán izgalmas. 
Minden játékos körében van egy rossz és egy jó fázis. Előny (vagy az árulást tekintve hátrány), hogy lehet választani a rossz fázisban 3, a jó fázisban 4 lehetőség közül. 
Egy szerencsétlen setup-ból pár kör alatt el lehet bukni a játékot de normál esetben az árulónak nincsen könnyű dolga. Igaz ha a többi játékos nem keresi akkor a felfedetlensége előnyt jelent neki a játék végén.

RATING: 8
Shadows Over Camelot is a semi-cooperative game where the players are knights of the Round Table; there is a chance that one of the players is a traitor, working against the Round Table, but it is by no means guaranteed.  Each turn the players may take 1 free action or may sacrifice a life point and take 2 actions, but they must always draw a card from the black deck which represents the opposition's actions.  The knights must complete quests thereby winning white swords, but if any quests are lost they gain black swords.  At the end of the game if there are more white than black swords the loyal knights win, otherwise the traitor and/or the game wins.

Since the role of the opposition is played out via a deck of cards the players must coordinate their actions in order to win the game.  Many quests will ebb and flow, and this will add great tension to the decisions.  A wasted decision can spell disaster.  On their turns the players must choose to move to a quest, or play a card from their hand on their current quest location, but if they cannot play a card on their current quest they must move.  Players must think ahead as moving can be a tiresome waste.  Players may also accuse someone of being the traitor, but they are penalized if they get it wrong, however if there is a traitor and he is undiscovered he may convert 2 white swords to black and thus tip the scales.

This is a great cooperative game that has seen many a knight die, a few traitors win, and required active participation by all players.

Seems rather similar to Lord of the Rings in many respects. The fun you have is entirely dependent on what the players bring to the table, which is true of any game I suppose, but this one really relies on a fun group. That doesn't necessarily make it a very good game in my eyes. Another concern I have with this game is the re-playability in terms of variation in the game and in terms of how experienced players will approach the method of playing once they've developed a winning strategy. Finally, the theme doesn't really excite me (I consider the whole theme of King Arthur to be a giant yawn), and therefore the game is running an uphill battle to excite me in the first place.

Without any doubt, [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=132&Itemid=1]Battlestar Galactica[/url][/i] is based on this design.  Nevertheless, that game is for some reason a lot more thematic, tense and involving, while [i]Shadows over Camelot[/i] is kind of simple and abstract in comparaison, despite the magnificent ambientation of its great components.  It is, however, an enjoyable game; just not one to play in a regular basis and probably only if [i]Battlestar Galactica[/i] is not around or if there isn't enough time to play it.

One of the best written cooperative games out there.  Appeals to both gamers and non-gamers alike as players take the role of a Knight of Round Table, trying to complete quests with their compansions befor Camelot falls into darkness.  The twist?  A traitor may be amongst you.  This game uses card management, knowing when and where to play the rare, but powerful cards, and when to hope your weaker cards will succeed.  Absolutely beautiful board and pieces.

What a great cooperative game-- then again, I'm kind of a sucker for players v. board games. I loved the Aurthorian legends, so I love to play them out, naturally!

This game is hard to classify for me.  It's a co-op with a hidden traitor mechanism, however the traitors could very easily remain hidden the entire game, I feel there's no design space spent on finding out who the traitors are unless a traitor player is given a very good opportunity to plant a knife in someone's back, at which point it becomes painfully obvious.  Still a game I'll play though, one of the few games that seats 8 and still feels like a board game.

My wife and I generally do not enjoy straight-forward, traditional cooperative board games. For one, the "alpha gamer" problem can be very annoying; hey, it's my turn, so don't tell me what to do. Also, we usually don't feel very satisfied by either winning or losing: if we win, then we all win together which just isn't as interesting (probably because we are selfish).

But I knew Shadows Over Camelot would be different. However, the main question was "would it be different enough for us to like it?" Answer: yes! It is really great.

We played our 5 times over the course of 3 days, teaching new people in 3 of those 5 games. The actions are simple and generally go pretty fast. The quests are abstract, but the graphic design makes them feel unique and interesting, some being solo and some needing multiple people to be successful.

Yet really it's the traitor that matters. This is so great. Who is the traitor? Do we even have one? Everyone has to make shady moves at some point in the game, so it works really well for the traitor to hide in the shadows.

After a couple of plays, I asked my wife if this seemed more like Pandemic (which we don't really like) or more like The Resistance (which we have really enjoyed a lot in the past). We decided it feels more like a hidden identity/bluffing social game than a normal co-op game. And that makes us happy to have it.

This is a pretty fun game, that grows on me with each playing. The traitor is what makes this game work, otherwise it  would be a fairly standard co-op. Good for occasional play. [Update: Sometimes, when the cards are against you, the game falls comepletely flat. It makes for a boring game for the traitor, too, as they don't have to do any work and the knights are still doomed. This is problematic.]

Update: Some of my best game experiences has been playing this game.  I knew we'd like it, but I couldn't guess how much.

Who thought playing community poker hands could be this much fun?  Of course, the card play has almost next to nothing to do with the game.  There are some scalability issues with the game I think.  It seems easier to beat the game with more players and nearly impossible to beat it with the minimum of 3 players.  I personally find it hard enough to win the game without the traitor, but it's the traitor that makes the game truly unique.  It's very, very difficult to beat a traitor who knows what he's doing, but of course it can be done.  A lot of fun.

Shadows is a punishingly brutal game for 1 or 2 players and simply really difficult for 3, but at 4 the game becomes unnecessarily easy.  If your game group plays with 3 or more, buy the Merlin's company expansion to increase the difficulty.

Almost up there with Knizia's Lord of the Rings game but falls short for me, paradoxically for the very reason that others prefer it: the essentially non-linear storyline.  It raises the bar yet again for this sort of game though.
Has gone down a point for the broken end-game.  Has gone down another point because it's now got boring.  Although it's a high pick when I find people who haven't played it yet.
In a recent discussion we concluded that the game only really works if everyone thinks there's a traitor but there isn't one.

Very very pretty.  I like the paranoia engendered by the clash of selfish interests, group interests, and the overhanging possibility of someone being the traitor.  Suffers a bit from downtime issues, from anti-climactic endings, a little randomness, and most especially from the vague "how vague do I have to be when discussing things" issue that also plagued Knizia's Lord of the Rings.  An "experience" game, but one of the better ones.

Cooperative game that's dripping with theme. One of you might be the traitor, though. Great components, and I really feel immersed in the theme when playing. I'm going to keep wanting to play this until I get to be traitor at least once. Weakness of the game is gamers get bored with not being traitor, and non-gamers can get intimidated by being traitor on their first play. Also not a fun game if people don't get into the theme. Depends a lot on who you play with, and combined with the large player complement, it's hard to get a good group to play this.

As a general rule, I do not particularly care for cooperative games that involve a traitor element.  This one is no exception.  It gets something of a pass for being playable without a traitor.  However, I've never played that way because people seem to think that the traitor makes the game more interesting.  If that is true, I expect that the rating will go down if I actually ever play the game without the traitor.  [06/28/2009]

Nothing really wrong with the game, but nothing really right with it either. For what is basically a very simple game, there is just too much rules - too much stuff that adds nothing to dynamics of the game. Game flow is too static - this is mostly a co-op and you're having 3 decisions per game, you're just doing one thing over and over again. The traitor element doesn't seem as strong as in BSG for instance, focus here is not so much on what traitor does, but how to discover one (or two). It's a game where good parts (interaction) are buried and hidden under many layers of relatively bland mechanics. Not as overbloated as BSG, but not 1/4 as intriguing either.

For those who enjoy a good co-op, Shadows over Camelot is a near perfect marriage of the abstract onslaught of Ghost Stories and the deeply thematic "don't know who to trust" zombie apocalyptic Dead of Winter.

This game is extremely easy to pick up.  The rules are simple and easily explained, although there are a lot of them.  Gameplay is pretty straight forward and at first it seems like its simply a "luck of the draw" type game, but after 3 games its clear that there really is quite a bit of strategy involved.  

However, this game is extremely difficult.  In the first three games we played, we lost all of them!  The end of the game can get extremely tense and for us it boiled down to this question : "Which way do we want to lose this game?"  That said, this game is a blast to play!  

This was my first collaboration game and the change from competing against everyone else to all trying to work together was extremely satisfying.  I highly reccommend this game if you ever get the chance to play.

All parts of this game - figures, cards, the board - are very beautiful. The idea of all the players playing against the game itself is nice, and it works better in SoC than for example in the FFG's Lord of the Rings. I have played games which are "greater", but I usually pick SoC from my bookshelf if I have guests who would like to play boardgames, but don't know too many of them. SoC is simple and quick enough, it's not too competitive (not too serious minded), but there's always much fun when playing it. A very nice game!

RATING: 7
Cooperative game with a twist. First the components are almost excellent; I just wish that the cards were of a regular size so protecting them would have been easier.

The game play is really cooperative, no collective quest can be done by one individual easily.

The communication part must be worked out at the begening; being in character helps a lot.

And finally the paranoia touch is really great.

[4 plays] Not very deep, but a fun social adventure. The strong possibility of a traitor in the midst is the thing that really creates the experience. I didn't feel the need to own this game myself any more, so I sold it, but I enjoy it well enough to get involved almost any time if it is suggested..

I wish the card mechanic was somehow more suited to the the theme than basically forming poker hands, but I still think it is ok. This game has lots of motions, bells, and whistles - but the overall tensions and rewards could be probably achieved for me quicker and better with Pandemic, poker, or Werewolf.

Most recent play 12/8/12 with Michael, Corey, Corey's buddy Sandy, Brian P, Carter, and Donovan. Something about Michael's happy nonchalance placing siege engines gave him away as the traitor to me very early on. Following through on my vow from the previous game, I accused him as soon as it was legal to do so. He was the traitor indeed, but our overall play wasn't helped by the reveal and we lost fairly rapidly anyway. I'm afraid I made the game less fun and tense for everyone, which is a shame that the game can be legally broken this way if an early correct accusation happens.

2nd most recent play 3-14-08 with Carter, Donovan, Alex, Michael, and Garrett. Alex was the traitor, and I was 95% certain, but I failed to accuse him before the game spiraled into the drain.

This is almost a great game. The components are wonderfully evocative of the theme, but otherwise the theme is thin, in terms of actual gameplay. The cooperation element is welcome, but the traitor function is problematic. A small game with a traitor is impossible to win, and a big game without a traitor is too easy. But some players don't want to be the traitor, and a traitor who has been successfully accused should be eliminated instead of becoming an ongoing hassle.

The last time I played, we had seven players... the game ended in a flurry of inaccurate accusations of the traitor, and Camelot fell even though we didn't actually have a traitor.

It's a simple game with beautiful components. It's little too easy for loyal knights to win, and traitor doesn't have a lot of options for sabotage so expansion is essential for long term replayability.

Игра не вполне оправдала надежды. Думал будет посерьёзней, однако как и все прочие игры от DoW, здесь всё достаточно просто в механике и недолговечно в плане "надоедаемости". Возможно, что при игре большим, чем 3-4 человека, составом игра предателя будет самодостаточней. Пока же сами его цели и механизмы действия довольно просты. При игре втроем, если не выпал предатель, то как правило игру обыграть несложно. В обратном случае, проигрыш практически гарантирован.

Decent enough game, but after just ONE playing on normal mode (i.e. No traitor) it seemed too simplistic.  It only took one play which resulted in a loss to figure out what to do and what not to do.  4 games after that we won landslide victories in our favor.  I guess my expectations were raised after reading multiple session reports of people who had played and played and still not achieved victory.  Oh well, you win some, you lose some.  ;D

The game is MUCH better played with a traitor. It adds a completely random element and makes you second guess everybody else's motives.

But it still feels a little too much like the game is playing itself and I'm just a spectator in the process.

Unusual activity-based co-operative game. Mechanical in feel with card management. Not particularly tension-filled despite fighting against the deck and the limited number of actions given. Numbers do matter. Greater numbers of players will tip the game in favour of the Round Table while fewer will assist the traitor if there is one. There is probably an optimal number of players for balance. Game is highly overrated.

After several plays, with or without the traitor, this game is hard.  I think that being a little too eager to finish quests before they are necessary did us in, as completing them doesn't stop the onslaught of black cards.  And if you're reading this, I hate you Morgan.

My first play was the only one to use the traitor.  We had it rough trying to manage all of the possible quests and it turned out to be a good test of teamwork.  In the end, we suspected a traitor but couldn't afford to be wrong in accusing him.  We should've done it anyway...

I wanted to love this game, but honestly, I'd rather play most any of my other games first. SoC, to my thinking, is mostly a card game disguised as a board game (which isn't a bad thing - this is just a neutral description of what it is). Players attempt to get runs, pairs, and full houses before the game does nasty things to the Knights of the Round Table. The game is gorgeously produced, but this just doesn't make up for the gameplay and the large amount of downtime. Given the lightness of the game, it also just drags on for far too long for what it is. I love Arthurian legends, high fantasy, etc. But I'd play plain old Rummy or something similar before playing SoC again (hence, I traded it away). Now, granted, these comments are only based on one four player game, so give them whatever weight you feel appropriate. But from where I stand, I've played enough games to make a pretty keen assessment for myself. Being forced to play further games would have only driven my rating of the game down further - so I got out while I was ahead.

I am sensitive to the point that this is an "experience" game. Despite all our fun quoting Monty Python and making medieval jokes, the "experience" just wasn't that great. For an "experience" game, I'd much rather play Plunder or Pirate's Cove (piratey goodness, arrrgh!), replete with jokes about pinnaces, "arrrr, matey"s, and piratical derring-do - or Lord of the Rings, which provides very tense, thematic fun.

Update: Well, a second play with more people who know the game better sees my feelings about the game drop EVEN further. I feel as if, during this second play, I saw the game at its best. That said, my biggest problem with Shadows is the lack of meaningful decisions. There are no "deliciously difficult choices" to be made in this game, from my perspective. Couple that with the fact that one's turn often consists only in moving from the Round Table to a quest or playing a single card (with no immediate effect), and watching other people make similarly banal moves, and you get a recipe for ho-humming. Even with a traitor (or more correctly, the possibility of one), Shadows just has no where *near* the tension for me that Knizia's Lord of the Rings does. The latter game I have played a bunch of times now, and get so much more out of. When Shadows was released, many people made the claim that it borrowed things from LotR: the corruption track becomes the black vs. white swords, and so forth - but they are very different cooperative games to my mind. Objectively, after two plays I'd say that SoC is a better game than I first thought - perhaps on a purely objective scale it would get a 6 from me. But I don't want to play it any more than I did after my first play. When this game debuted on the Geek, it was quite the darling. I obtained it right after it was published and didn't see what the fuss was about. Ironically, I kept wondering how so many other people could find SoC so fun and engaging, and I could not. What was wrong with me?!? The hivemind of Geekland now reveals, of course, that I was/am not alone.

There seems to be a lot of tough choices, and though there is randomness, it seems that mastering the strategy of determining where the best place to go is will be a large factor.  The traitor factor keeps things interesting.

The rules seemed to be a bit quirky and intimidating for what is essentially a family card game.

I increased my rating after the second play in which I played a seven-player game WITHOUT a traitor.  That was interesting, and the game isn't supposed to be that great without the traitor.  It's a good coorperative game for the right type of gamers.

Game was fun for awhile, but after playing it enough the game started to get old and the length and other mechanisms starting to hurt it.  The expansion helped its life and I got a good amount of plays out of it but it is never played anymore.  Other games do the traitor element better like Battlestar Galactica and Dead of Winter.  

The traitor element is just poorly designed.  If the traitor gets lucky and gets the card to reveal themselves early on then the game is lost.  They can sit there adding catapults every turn and I don't think they can lose.  Otherwise they are playing the game out and most of the time the game doesn't care if you play as a traitor or not.  I have helped the other side as much as possibly even as a traitor and they still lost.  Playing the traitor is just really boring.

[b]Pros[/b]:
-Like the knight theme, and how it relates to the variable player powers
-The traitor can be easily masked during the game just due to the luck of the draw not being in a player's favor

[b]Cons[/b]:
-Traitor in a coop
-Can drag out, especially for the traitor if they're not very good at what they do and they've been revealed

[b]Rating[/b]:
-Might be better if it was created to not have a traitor, but the way the game plays out, it kind of requires one to add some excitement to the game

RATING: 7
I do like this anyway, also thanks to the outstanding Days of Wonder components, but the traitor mechanics is perhaps too diluted (depending on the number of players). My impression is that the potential for a memorable game of this is there but the conditions for it to occur happen with rather low probability (games with no traitors end up being rather dull).

RATING: 7.5
Quick turns make this game work with a lot of players. The chance of a traitor keeps this co-operative game interesting and leads to a lot of fun table talk. It's simple familiar rummy style battle system and familiar Arthurian theme makes it great to introduce younger friends into the genre with. Days of Wonder is great at choosing "Gateway Games" to develop.

Traitor aspect only works if everyone is on the same level.  Not an ideal situation when you have new players in the group. This game starts very strong but can bog down toward the end. Turns are fast and it's easy to teach so it's still a go to for cooperative games for me.

I can appreciate the role this game has played in the history of board games, but it just bores me. You basically just create poker hands in the slowest possible fashion. The only tension comes from a potential traitor that grinds the game to halt when revealed. Not even a Days of Wonder production can make up for that.

RATING: 5
When I first played this game I thought that this game was dry and systematic. I knew that this was undoubtedly an effective and efficient system, but I also felt that the game could run a bit clinical.  

After the first playing I didn't realize how group dependant this game was. I was surprised at how something that should be light fun, in contrast was so cold. 

Then I played this with a completely different group, it was loud and fun and silly.  Lots of accusations and still down to the wire.  Excellent tension as we beat back the odds. 

Ultimately, it is a great experience game, based on a boring contract rummy mechanic. It requires verbal, gregarious people that don't expect much in the way of gameplay.

I'm not sure how the replay on this one is going to be, but this will be an excellent game to pull out a friend's copy once a year and play over a couple bottles of wine.  

(Still, as far as co-operative games go, Arkham Horror beats this, hands down.)

UPDATE: I have nothing against this game, but I have no desire to play this again.

It can be a little bit frustrating to play for a few hours and then lose against the game itself but I find when that happens everyone starts talking about what went wrong and discusses strategies and then just wants to play again to see if they can win. I hope to play this many more times.

This is the definitive co-op game for me.  The gameplay is simple, but there are enough threats on the board that there's quite a bit of tactical considerations.

Cooperative game with a hidden traitor mechanism.  The game looks intimidating at first, but the gameplay is actually fairly simple and fun and serves as a good way to draw people into the hobby.  I tend to think of this as a lighter alternative to BSG and Dead of Winter.  One drawback is that I think this game would actually get less good the more plays a group has, since suboptimal play would be a dead giveaway for the traitor.

Oh, and it has *great* components.

RATING: 8
This game is great! We had a full seven players for our first play through and it didn't drag at all. The way the game forces you to further evil's aims, even if you are loyal adds a great level of challenge in uncovering the traitor. :D

Not a game to play with folks who get frustrated/angry easily, but this game is an overall great, fun and challenging co-op!

Although I have played SoC several times, it has been with the same three people and without a traitor. In addition, I always get stuck with the thankless duty of fighting catapults outside of Camelot. I suspect that adding a few more players and the traitor mechanic are going to pull this rating up (as will the new Merlin's Company expansion, woohoo!) 

UPDATE: Still playing the one-man counter-siege and finding that SoC becomes exponentially easier to beat when you're running it with experienced players - even with a traitor. Sometimes I make suboptimal moves just for fun. 

I can't say for sure that I like the base game enough to drop another thirty bucks on the Merlin expansion, though, even if it toughtens things up significantly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It was fun to unofficially accuse each other of being the traitor and to joke about tavern wenches etc., but the game is mechanically simple and too easy for the traitor to win. Many have mentioned before that you can often guess you are going to lose before the loss takes place half an hour later. Don't think I will play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be on the first play, but it's grown on me with each subsequent play. It definitely requires teamwork - especially with many players. One player can't possibly win a quest playing one card per round if seven players are drawing black cards each round. I did like how close my first game was at the end. We had to engineer a situation to finish with 13 swords so that we could survive a traitor revelation. I must confess that the game is starting to wear a bit after several plays. It may be time to toss in some expert rules. On a recent game, we seriously curtailed table talk to the point where we didn't voice the need for help on multi-knight quests nor hinted to Arthur what cards we needed. This made the game more difficult, and the traitor won.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Especially fun with a good group, Shadows delivers a lot of excitement.  Interesting that there might not be a traitor at all.  A good challenge!  Beautiful production.  I feel like perhaps I am not enjoying the game as much as I first did, just because the effort that you put into an action sometimes feels like you're just doing something negative.  But it's just such a gorgeous game it's hard for me to let go.  *Update* - I'm letting go.  Too long and not enough substance, and while the traitor element is fun it's just not as amazing as I want it to be.

This game is a blast and it can be a nice change of pace to play a game where you're not competeing against everybody.  Also the traitor can completely change the way the game plays every time depending on their actions.  The traitor also adds a little paranoia to the game having you question certain choices made by your team mates.  Just a great game you can sit down with and not worry about trying to out manuever and out think the other players (unless you're the traitor).

The endgame is tedious and overlong, the traitor mechanic is interesting in concept but poor in execution (would be much better if it was an actual player choice and not just a card draw), the need to keep cards hidden and never talk about specific numbers is awkward at best, the rules are poorly explained.  The only things going for the game is the art and well-made physical components.  Both Arkham Horror and Lord of the Rings are better done co-op games.

An excellent collaborative game.  The theme is great, and the group I play with has painted the miniatures, making this an even more beautiful game.  I like how you're trying to beat the game and the traitor, and it is fun trying to figure out who exactly is the traitor.  I might have this a little high, as after a couple of plays, I'm not quite as crazy about it, but it still is fun.

A co-op game, with a traitor.

I played it solo (with no traitor), and I like it but it was difficult because you really need at least 4 knights to do all the various quests at once.

One of the first cooperative games. Many others have been released since; and with more exciting puzzles to solve, like Pandemic, Shadows shows its age. It's very methodical and altogether too easy.

This is polarising my opinions at the moment. 2 plays: the 1st was great fun, the 2nd felt like a slog. It appears that the second play was slow-going as we had a traitor in our midst.

After 16 plays I will still almost always play this, so it's up to a 9/10.

I've played it twice and the second time I was the traitor, which resulted in an easy win, albeit a hollow victory, so I lowered my rating a point to a seven.  It takes a decent chunk of time to play and this time I didn't feel involved enough. Not a bad game if you have a group of several people.  Visually striking for what that's worth.  I wonder if a third playing will reveal that there's no meat here, kind of like ordering a steak at a restaurant and the plate is all dressed up with a tiny fillet in the middle.

RATING: 6
This is a cooperative game with a hidden traitor much in the same vein as Battlestar Galactica.  There is one key difference with that mechanic that sets this game apart from other games like BSG though, no matter how many players you play with there is always a chance there is no traitor in the game.

In games like BSG you know there is at least one traitor among you and you know how many possible ones there can be.  You might not know who or even when they start working against you but by being observant and discerning enough you should be able to figure out who they are.  In this game there is always a max of 1 traitor and with any player number may not be any.  With more players there is more chance of there being a traitor of course because more of the 8 role cards are handed out, but even with 7 there is still that chance.

This gives the game a sense of delightful paranoia because catching the traitor before he is revealed can be beneficial to the team but accusing a fellow knight of being a traitor has serious consequences.  So not knowing if anyone at all is even working against you has you double-guessing the signs you see and perhaps even seeing signs that aren't there and I love it.

Past that the game is standard cooperative fair.  Players each have a special ability, spend a certain number of action points on their turn, and are smacked around by an event deck each turn.  The game is won by obtaining sword tokens and these are obtained by completing different kinds of mini-games on the map.  This is entertaining enough but the real game is the mind games of trying to figure out if there is a traitor and if so, who.

Even without a traitor, this game is HARD.  If your game does have a traitor in it, it may be almost unwinnable because you are not only playing against the game but also this player and have one less player on your side and who knows how long or how badly he has been sabotaging you.

Everything I've said above is true but I've become less and less a fan of this game with each subsequent play.  I love the "there might or might not be a traitor" mechanism in the game because it does create the delightful feeling of paranoia even when there may not even be a traitor among you.  I just wish it were attached to a better game.  The decisions aren't as interesting as I would like them to be and this game has a lot of downtime when it isn't your turn as there is very little else to do.  Plus it tends to take quite a while, which is never a good combination with large swaths of downtime.

I like the conversation part of the game, I don't like the unbalanced mechanisms that make Shadows much more easyer to the traitor than it is to the loyals. I guess it would have to be like this but, eitherway, I think it shouldn't be that obvious.

The rest of the game, apart from the "negotiation" is tedious and boring.

This game is extremely well-balanced, and kudos for clear rules and the amount of attention and care given to the art design, which in addition to being beautiful offers any number of little visual aids to playing the game and remembering what's what--though the rules are pretty easy to learn. Some aspects of the game come off to some as little more than a card game akin to rummy or multi-player solitaire, but there's so much debate about what to do next when we play that we don't mind. Easy to learn, easy to teach, and always a suspenseful ride. Plays just fine solo.

RATING: 7
Not a bad experience.  It's a good co-op because it's light enough for most people to pick up, yet treacherous due to the traitor mechanic.  I've seen quite a few games lost because of errant accusations earlier in the game.

The thing holding it back, ultimately, is its simplicity.  Playing full houses and straights isn't much of a game mechanic and decisions are often obvious.  Got 3 or more grails?  Go to the grail quest.  Got nothing that matches?  Go to the Excalibur quest.  I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with that, but the game feels very samey after a while.  It mostly boils down to lack of interactivity.  The game feels like it would be more fun if you had more to do than just lay cards down.

So-so game. My brother-in-law really likes it a lot, but for me, it just haven't really clicked. I think it's just way too random. I get zero sense of accomplishment from winning, because I feel like we where just lucky this time around.

Maybe the traitor element could be interesting, but I don't really see how it would fit in the game? It's just an endless battle against the damn catapults, and how adding a traitor to that fight would make it any more interesting is beyond my understanding. I haven't read the rules for the traitor mechanic though, so it might turn out I'm vastly mistaken.

As far as cooperatieve games go, this is much more an experience game than Lord of the Rings. But even then, the experience and tension in LotR easily beat this. The traitor is often hailed as being what makes this game great. It doesn't. It's just what's necessary to give this game some tension and preventing it from being flat-out dull.

I never liked this game as much as everyone else did.  The theme always seemed a bit random to the mechanics which is not what I want in a traitor game.  So it was fine, but the theme was pasted on, so why not go with a traitor game where it is not.

RATING: 7
A thematic, gateway, collaborative game that is ideal for larger groups. This is great fun and very interactive. The only issue I have with it, is that it gets somewhat repetitive after you play it a few times. So it ends up not being played as often simply because it becomes a second tier choice for the evening. But not so if you have a large group (say 6 players). I always play it with the traitor, which is what makes the game tremendous fun. The fact that you may have a traitor among your fellow mates, makes all the difference. The components are top quality and beautiful. There aren't many other games quite like this one! Guaranteed group fun.

This is a great game for the right group, but I'm not sure that's my group.  We found the game to be a real struggle, even without a traitor, though so much is determined by randomness in terms of the cards and dice that perhaps we just had bad luck.  Be that as it may, it's not popular with my regular gaming partners, so I'll probably not be playing again for a long time.

RATING: 8.5
This is a very cool co-operative game with a delicious little twist.  The twist, of course, being the possibility that one player is a traitor.  And what a remarkably well-done game it is!  Everything from the design of the game itself to the physical components has received a lot of tender loving attention to detail, which of course is standard fare from Days of Wonder.  The first glance at the 2 rule books might be initially intimidating, but after a single read-through of both books I felt like I had such a good grasp on the game that it seemed as if I had already played it.  The fact is, learning the game is surprisingly simple, even though the rules could have been slightly better organized between the 2 books.  It is mastering the game that is the deceptively difficult part.  After a 7-player and a 6-player game, both with traitors, and a traitorless 4-knight 2-player game, I still have not achieved a victory.  [Edit: I finally won a game with a traitorless 4-player game.]  And I'm glad it is so challenging - I would not want it to be easily beaten.  My only quibble with the game is the fact that a revealed traitor is still quite powerful, which doesn't leave enough incentive for the traitor to remain undiscovered, and the role of the undiscovered traitor then becomes fairly boring.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

Decent enough card-engine co-op game with typically absurd Days of Wonder overproduction. It's OK, I just don't understand why you would want to play it: as clearclaw's comment here says, it's just flipping cards and doing pointless things while the game plays itself.

I'm not averse to playing against an entropy generator, but Camelot has none of the elegance of Pandemic, nor the brilliant immersion of Space Alert. The traitor mechanism does add a little spice, which is all that saves the game from an even worse rating.

Played just once, and I could take it or leave it.  I'm not usually into light, "fun" games...if a game isn't food for the brain then I don't really see the point.  If I wanted to be immersed in "fun" settings and play styles, I'd play video games which do that sort of thing much more impressively.  I'd play it again if a group really wanted to, but probably just to play with the beautiful components.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't challenging or interesting in any meaningful way.

One of the best cooperative games I know. Not deep or meaty but fun especially in bigger groups and also with people who don't play that much.
The nice 'we the knights' feeling gets dampened by the abstract play mechanisms though (draw cards, play 'poker hands') and one can get stuck at a quest, so the next ten turns are pre-determined. Thatfor I deduct 1 point from the rating score.

RATING: 7
Very good theme play.  Fairly easy to learn, but easy to play.  Game play offers many choices and is challenging.  Many of the characters have interesting abilities.  Game play is heavily dependent on the dark forces card draw - the game can be too tough and very short at times.  The traitor element adds another dimension to the game without being overpowering.  The components are of excellent quality - mounted board, plastic playing pieces & somewhat durable cards.  Rulebook is clear.  Game length is not consistent.

[several plays] It has been a fun game to play.  A good unique cooperative game.  A few times it has been super tight games down to the wire game.  This means there have been very fun exciting finishes. It has a good simple interface for how the cards and quests work.  However, at some point the fact that it is a game about drawing and playing the right cards keeps this game from being great, and being a game I want to play all the time.  At its core it seems like it is mostly a card drawing exercise to get the right combinations of cards to defeat the quests.

RATING: 6.5
[DoW 2005 edition] {Medieval; cooperative with internal competition, secret identity, variable-player-power, player elimination, hand management; scalable} SoC is a very good gateway game. It has a strong theme and is very true to the original story. Players are just engaged in the game. Excellent player interaction: full of chats, cooperation and even intrigue. It needs a very good teamwork, esp. with more players, to win. They have to plan their actions and properly assign knights to quests.

It takes some time to teach the rules but the players can master the rules after first few rounds. Usually, the first play is a mess but it's getting better and funnier with more plays. 

I prefer playing it with this variant: turning over white swords, instead of adding black swords when losing a quest. It makes the game more tactical and exciting.

SoC is scalable. With more players, it becomes more difficult to control a quest because black cards appear faster in a quest and the knights may not react in time. With fewer players, it becomes easier to control a quest, but the power of traitor is stronger. Therefore, regardless of the number of players, SoC is alike challenging. 

The traitor shall have good bluffing skill in order to win. It's a good rule that a traitor is not out of game even if he is revealed; o/w, it's much more difficult for a traitor to win. Besides, the knights have to judge if it's good to accuse a traitor even though they know who he is.

After three tries, I guess I'll just have to admit that I will never be a fan of cooperative games.  This on is particularly odd, with the traitor, but still the "game system" is terrible easy to beat and the traitor is easily smoked out.  It was a nice try and thought but in the end, the game just doesn't make the cut.  There are of course worse games out there, but not many that people on BGG speak rather highly about.

RATING: 7
First cooperative game that I've enjoyed. Less processional than Lord of the Rings, excellent theme, components and the ganging together to complete certain quests have created  great do or die camaraderie in the group. The the Strategy is very deep but there is certainly enough to challenge the group. The order in which the black cards appear together with the combination of white cards that you get make for a surprisingly different game most times. Excellent roll play and theme; superb components and a great mid weight strategy game.
While it takes the most enoyable aspects of patience as a basis it develops this hugely into a more varied, strategic, co-operative and altogether satisfying game. 
It's certainly not intensive stategy. However I like how some of the turns flow fast when you know what you need to do and others require more careful consideration.
The fact that you can see all the quests building up on each turn adds to the sense of impending doom.

My only concern is whether there is enough in the game to make it last.

Played once. Seemed quite long for what it was, lots of AP, although maybe down to a learning game. It felt quite non-dynamic, not much happening compared to other co-ops (e.g. Pandemic).

Very basic co-op game with a traitor. There are a few interesting things, but largely it is way too simplistic to be interesting. Also, the traitor can be pretty boring if found out early and there can be some pretty big swings in luck overall. This might have started a genre, but ultimately there are much better games out there that do similar things but with more interesting decisions.

I have only played this with my kids but they picked it up quite well. So far we haven't used the traiter- I know it's the whole point- but I think I need another adult with me to manage the younger players before venturing into this side of it. Nice bix and bits, bit confusing at first wether another player can put a card on someone elses quest etc. I like the theme- it seems to stick well to what little I know of the legends of the knights of the RT. Looking forward to the difficulting changing and the suspicions when the traitor is amongst us!
Ahhh...have just played a few games with the traitor and it was great fun. He won both games but it was close. Only prob is my son can't help guessing who it is as soon as the cards are dealt.
And again... played with wife and two sons. The youngest one played a very innocent traitor and even though he was uncovered it was too late. Wife thinks the game is  bit gloomy- it is! but gloom +  suspense = fun in my book.

Played with three players and was not convinced. I even like the cooperative LotR game better, and that means something. Gameplay seemed random, erratic and chaotic to me. I was missing a big storyline. Instead, the players are trying to extinguish the fires here and there as they spread, never really in control of the game flow (which is, in my eyes, the big difference to Knizia's aforementioned LotR game). Will play again, but only with more players, and moreover, with a traitor. Hopefully we can get more out of the potential then.

A solid cooperative game. Having a traitor makes it less prone to "analysis bullies", which plague most coop games.

Also, I don't like coop games.

Really enjoyed for the first few games, but I've sort of lost interest.  For a cooperative game, Arkham Horror blows it away.

This is a lot of fun if played with the right group.  The possibility of the traitor adds a lot of tension.  I have had very tense wonderful times with many groups.  The gameplay can actually drag on a little bit when people aren't paying attention.  Most of the interesting decisions are made as a group periodically.  There is not very many interesting decisons made when it is your turn.  Having the traitor really takes this game to another level.  The theme helps a lot with the game.

I absolutely love the theme, but find the game almost painful to play.  It feels like I'm actually obligated to finish the game after I've agreed to play it.  I'm really hoping that the upcoming expansion makes this game at least somewhat exciting to play.

This is a really solid game that I bought because I wanted a game for a group of non-gamer friends and they had expressed interest in a cooperative game. They all loved it. It has great strategy for new and advanced players and I think there is a degree of replayability though I think too many times might get repetitive. Looking forward to getting the expansion though and I think that will add enough variation to keep it fresh for a long time. Also I think some of the variants here will help a lot.

If you play, like me during my first game, the traitor character it's amzing. Every round I made actions against loyal knights well hidden behind my status and spoke. The game seems really simple and it's based on cooperation between players who tries to avoid too many failures on quests avaiable. Graphics is WONDERfull and seems quite wasted for the amount of space required over the table. If you like big production but not high complex game, this is for you. Its linearity and limited choice every round make it one good family games or at least an accessible game with an evergreen theme. Anyway dark side will ALWAYS win!

I really enjoy this game, and am usually willing to play, but  the experience can vary greatly from play to play.  I have had games that came down to the very last card and OMG! We Won!

RATING: 4.8
Weird that for most, BSG retired this. For our group (who played BSG first) this is a refined, streamlined version of BSG...

I like this so far.

Update: it seems very solved after only a few plays and frankly, collecting poker style hands of cards isn't that much fun. After additional plays, the playing of cards is really dull and if you end up on grail duty, you might not actually get to do anything for 2 hours. That's pretty appalling. This game also seems to be the worst contender yet for Alpha player syndrome.

Rating down from 6.4 to 4.8

I like this game well enough.  It's so hard to win, the knights have to work so well together, but the addition of the traitor makes it difficult.  A lot of intrigue.  Can be made harder with a house rule whereas no discussion of the cards in hand is allowed at all.

Battlestar Galactica pretty much makes this game obsolete to me.  The only redeeming quality this one has over BSG is the play time.  

Also, my wife will play this one, but has as of yet, not played BSG.  So that's one of the reasons it remains currently.

An interesting co-op game.  The sense of overwhelming evil combined with the potential for a traitor make for a hectic game.  Much like in legend focusing all energy on the Grail quest causes the rest of Camelot to go to pot rather quickly.

RATING: N/A
+ great "King Arthur of Camelot" theme
+ the possibility that one of the players may be a traitor drives people crazy during the game !?
-- It seems especially tough to win because it's so overly costly to travel and to draw cards and both is essential to do anything at all.

Coop

I have over 20 games of this under my belt with various people and each time it was a hit.  I had to go out and purchase card sleeves as the cards were starting to get worn out.  Although not as easy to introduce as Ticket to Ride this is a game that works GREAT for new boardgamers once you get through the first few turns.  If you plan on trying to play this cerebrally - forget it.  This is a game of twister, not chess.  It is more about player interaction and subversion than min/maxing the cards.  If your group plays socially - this is a game you should simply NOT let pass by.

Update:  Time and more coop games have moved this down my rating.  Still a good gateway game for introducing to new players but I prefer to pull out games like Pandemic or Ghost Stories over this one now.

SoC has a very good mechanic and you really need to play as a group to reach the victory, otherwise the evil will defeat you for sure. This is good but there is a risk: playing as a gruop one player could leads the others that would become drones in his hand, and this is not so funny.
Moreover Knights' special ability are not well balanced: Kay or King Arthur abilities are more incisive than Palamedes or Tristan ones.
Good game for good gamers.

I like it better than Battlestar Galactica, it is a little lighter and shorter.  That being said, it is still long and your decisions are, if anything, more limited.  I do like the fact there are fewer tactical things to concern yourself with so you can take the game less seriously.  Overall though it is still not what I would describe as a must have game.  While this lasted maybe 3 hours and similar size BSG games last for 4+ hours I really really wish both games would be more in the 1-2 range.

YES!  YES!  This game is AWESOME!  I played it once; it seemed really daunting at first appearance.  It appears as if it will have a huge learning curve, it really doesn't.  Oddly it%u2019s almost a sort of basic cardgame with more going on.  I saw very few things about this game that I didn't enjoy, everything worked well, and everyone had a good time even though we lost.  I love that the traitor is has so little chance of being there but you always question the other players actions.  The pieces are very well produced and eye catching. I would vote for this to be the best game of 2005 simply because I had so much fun.

Addendum: Played it again and won this time, still alot of fun.  I do find it a little too long though.

This one was on my want-list for quite some time. I finally bought in Essen 2005 and played it a few times.
The game is all right, but in the end I was very disappointed. I had expected a bit more than that. It´s just about collecting abstract cards to beat "quests". Don´t let yourself be fooled by all these nice miniature and the beautiful board - there is nothing in the game mechanics to represent this! Utterly dry.

Most reviews and sessions (and praise and criticism) about SoC talks about the fact that it's wonderful the first few times it is played with a given group, then becomes stale.  But if there's a game that truly engages each new group that sees it, to the tune of immense fun, even if it's only for half a dozen plays, is that not worth it?

I think it is.  And my current game group is in that entranced phase.  I'm considering increasing my rating, but this is good for now.

Shadows is a fun and unique cooperative game, and I'm a fan of cooperative games.  I suppose comparisons to Lord of the Rings are inevitable, and I much prefer Lord of the Rings.

After reading the rules and the discussion here I thought I'd like this game more than I ended up liking. Gorgeous and extremely original game which works best with more players than we had (3) - we didn't use traitor which, I think, keeps the game more interesting and involving. A bit too repetive and I don't see myself playing this constantly. But still, definitely an interesting game.

Battlestar Galactica beats this by miles.

Gotta say I enjoy this cooperative game much more than the Knizia LotR game, and not just because of the traitor, which does add a nice twist to the concept.

My family has yet to win a game but it's fun none-the-less. We start every game with a new strategy only to be crushed by the game. We'll win eventually. I've read realistic reviews that the win rate may be around 40% or so. Here's hoping.

An average co-op game with the singular unique idea of having there be an unknown number of traitors, which can lead to great or crushing games. A lengthy process for a series of set collection hunts and overall automatic actions. The ideas are sound and interesting, but it feels like it drags on a bit too long. While fun, Avalon feels like a game that does the same things in much less time.

Shadows Over Camelot has the most accessible theme of all of the modern semi-cooperatives.  The board's various quests give the cheerful impression of an amusement park!

After several years, this is still one of the strongest cooperative games on the market. It's fairly simple to teach, has the original traitor element (that is easy to remove for newcomers), and glorious production values.

I really like the basic idea of a cooperative game with a potential traitor but I didn't have much fun playing it.  Card collecting is just too simplistic and boring for this type of game.  It feels dumbed down for mass appeal.

UPDATE 1: FFG's Battlestar Galactica is looking like it might be the type of game I want this one to be.

UPDATE 2: Yup.  BSG takes the same basic contours but is a much richer, thematic, and nuanced game.  I see no reason to ever play Shadows Over Camelot again.

Great cooperative (maybe) game with many roads to victory ... or loss! Never knowing if the traitor is in the game leaves a lot of room for speculation. That shady rule about saying what you have without saying what you have is going on my nerves though. If one says "Have Merlin, need grail" or "Art thou on your way to seek out the wise grey-bearded man? I'd most pleasantly aid you on your enduring journey, if thoust are willing to spare a hint leading my way to the blessed cup of immortality" is basically the same.

Like Cosmic Encounter, this game seems to depend on the strength of its social interaction more than its mechanical design. The mechanics are easy to understand and explain, making it appear to be well suited for gaming groups that enjoy lighter "family style" board games and the social elements of gaming.

A rare combination of a cooperative board game that is actually well-designed.  All players play the good guys, and can choose their poison about how the bad events affect the game.  The potential traitor is what puts the real twist on this fun game.

RATING: 7
Days of Wonder usually hit a sweet spot for me.  The games have a good enough mixture of mechanics and fun to keep me interested, but are sufficient accessible that I can table them in any company.  Shadows over Camelot is no exception.

The mechanics here are pretty bare-bones, and if people take too long agonizing over the small number of decisions that are made the game can get a bit tedious, but on the flip side the game accommodates 7 (with drop-in/drop-out at any time), and moves enough of the interesting information onto the cards and into the player's hands that there isn't the same scope for one player to quarterback the whole team (c.f. Pandemic, for instance).

As with any "coop-with-a-optional-traitor" games, you have to decide whether to put in a possible traitor on a first game.  For Shadows, the mechanics are simple enough that a first-time player who pulls the traitor card is probably going to be able to be an effective traitor without having to ask rules questions that will obviously reveal his disloyalty.

Includes Merlin's Company expansion

Culled - First wave; Comics Place contribution

Why we culled it: SoC is a powerful sign of its times. It is a co-op game that wears its theme in great detail, and it serves as a wonderful soft entry point to the hidden-traitor mechanism. It is very much a classic co-op - The board is a puzzle rigged to defeat you, and it does very well until you solve that puzzle. Then the game becomes a walk in the park for the quarterback who ushers the team to victory, and a chore for the rest. Hidden traitors spice up the game to some extent, but the traitors lack a robust playground to do much relative to games with similar systems. SoC is perhaps the best gateway into games like BSG, but once you're playing BSG, it loses most of its relevance. I donated it to a game shop where it sees a lot of play, so I'm happy.

This is not a game.  There are no real decisions to make, no problems to solve, not even a clever mechanic to enjoy.  It is shameful how much hype this title has garnered, and it demonstrates an enormous gulf between gamers who wish to actually "game," versus those who seem satisfied with spectacle and atomospherics.

Good cooperative game.  Works well with 2 players (no traitor) even though the box doesn't list 2 players as an option.  Only played with the traitor once, and it was intense!  Playing without the traitor does get relatively easy after a while, but it's still fun.  Good components and nice theme, though it loses some appeal after a while, since the mechanics are fairly abstract.

RATING: 6
I really enjoy many aspects of this game after a first play through especially the decisions with advancing evil. Playing Dead of Winter before this has given me an appreciation for this as a more simplified/streamlined traitor game. I'm looking forward to playing this more. 

*Update* The first time my group played this it was fun at times but dragged, at first I put this down to a first play but after a second play I've come to the conclusion the game just isn't that interesting. The game is very simple perhaps too simple and it often leads to players feeling like they have no really decisions to make on their turn. The game also fails at having any tension as the pace of the game is so slow at times that you can see you've failed 7 or 8 turns ahead and its just merely a formality. The game is also far too long for what it is and I think many other social deduction games such as the Resistance can give you the same fun in a much quicker time frame. This game is hitting my trade list I'm sure many people enjoy it but for my group its fallen flat.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I liked this one and want to play it again.  Had a different feel than most co-ops.  I felt free to do what I wanted unlike a Pandemic type game where there is much more looking to the best player for what to do.  I guess the potential hidden trader is what causes everyone to do more of their own thing.

This game is so fun, when played with the right group. You almost have to use the traitor mechanic to make reach the game's full potential but even if don't it's not a bad game. The game creates a nice atmosphere for humorous interaction and entertainment. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good game, however some things that bother me:

1) Best played with more players, however there is much downtime, for little action. As an example: having 5 grail cards, or having a full house means you'll mostly be spending your next 5 turns doing the same action
2) Traitor seems pretty easy to spot
3) Can be a little to 'gamey' ie: Once we needed to fail a quest ASAP in order to win the game(just to fill the table with swords)

I think this game plays so well. The "almost" cooperative mechanic is great, and builds tension during the evil sections of the game. The decisions of how to advance evil(which everyone good and bad must do) can get pretty dicey towards the end. There is a drop-in and drop-out mechanic that not many other games have.

Nice idea (the traitor) poorly implemented. It's really difficult to see what you can do to be nasty and get away with it. I mean, it should be more interesting for the traitor to stay hidden, and I'm still not sure this is the case.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great classic. The traitor mechanic is everything in this game so make sure you have a high chance of drawing one. The different characters are fun. The card play is okay. The theme is cool but the mechanics are largely unrelated to these. Strategy gets a bit repetitive in this after many plays. 

Between this and Dead of Winter - I strongly prefer this with 4+ players and DoW with at most 4 players. This one flows very smoothly regardless of a high player count. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fantastic "introductory" semi-cooperative game (a game where it's the group vs. the board plus a secret traitor). Your enjoyment will be greatly enhanced if your play group gets into the flavor of being Knights of the Round Table and going out on glorious quests. Otherwise, the game play can be kind of dry. You basically just draw cards and then decide what the most efficient way to play your cards so that they match up with the quests.

Once people are comfortable with this, they should "graduate" to the granddaddy of epic semi-cooperative games, Battlestar Galactica.

Great game that is fun to play from time to time but won't get pulled out EVERY game night.  It might get there though if the replay value proves itself to be high.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A fine cooperative game that I wouldn't mind getting a copy of. The tension in this is a magnitude less than in Battlestar Galactica, but it's not as vicious as that game. Possibly a game I'd play with the family until the girl is old enough for a game with traitor roles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Haven't played a really good game of this.  Each time it either drags on too long, the traitor doesn't understand his roll, or it's been anti-climatic.  Doesn't strike me as a 'fun' game.  I think if I had more plays, I would be able to compare my current experiences with better ones, but for now it doesn't rate hight on my list. 

I do love the artwork and the quality that has gone into the game.  It makes me think that it could be an exciting game.

Love the (random) traitor. Not knowing if there is a traitor and who it could be is really fun. Rest of the game is fun, though the poker-style hands and the end of the game being a bit boring drag it down just a bit. I prefer BSG and DoW over it, but it's still one of my favourite games and I'll gladly play it. This game always brings out the Monthy Python quotes and role-player in me.

I love the production quality of this game.  The components are beautiful and the theme is really well done (and immediately understandable by new people).

The balance is pretty good too.  We lost the first couple of games - just trying to do everything at once.  But now, even with some beginners playing, we can pretty much get it each time - although it can be a close thing.

I still haven't played with an experienced traitor though - waiting to see how that changes the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really enjoyed playing Shadows; it seemed to strike the right balance with its difficulty level and fun factor.

I think the real success of this game is that the Knights must work together in order to achieve the objectives.  If they try to run off and do each quest piecemeal, they are toast.

I've played it with Merlin's company, and enjoyed the traveling cards, Merlin's presence, and the new Knights.  

Update 11/20/09: I've heard it said in various reviews and comments that Pandemic is a superior cooperative experience; rubbish!  Shadows over Camelot may be a little older, but it is a much better cooperative game that rewards strategy and gives you waay more options as a player.

A cooperative game, everyone can just sit down and enjoy a little entertainement as everyone together reaches to victory and be happy. Not on this game.

An OK game. I would play it if offered, but I can't say much more.

The traitor mechanic is weak (it is rather easy to discover him/her, as the subpar actions are easier to see than in Battlestar Galactica, for one).

The gameplay isn't bad, just lackluster and slightly boring for me, specially if the traitor is out - then the game can became really easy (a bad thing for a cooperative game).

A fun semi coop game thats super hard. Mechanically, there isnt much going on you're playing cards down one at a time. But when you add the traitor into the game, it brings so much to the game. The core to this game is that player interaction. The more subtle mechanism in the game can lead to great, what i like to call, advance techniques where there are many actions that you can do that can go both ways as a honourable knight and evil traitor would do the exact same way; adding to the semi coop feel to the game.

Jury is still out on whether I like this game, or am annoyed by it.  It is actually easier to beat then most co-op games, and I get tired of everyone constantly accusing everyone of being a traitor.  It just seems that the traitor can effect the game, but really not enough to be freaking out at the beginning rounds of the game.  With that said, it is still a fun game, but not the first game I am grabbing out of the game closet.

A former 10 for me has fallen. Maybe only due to my own changing tastes, as I get into heavier longer games. Played with the same group a few times, and the same things start to happen even though it is more fun to try to hide being the traitor. played with new groups all the time and being the traitor is too random. 

I don't know. I still really can't find anything wrong with the game--to me it is great game on my most treasured traits: interaction, interesting decisions, and fun. allows for really clever thinking.

I guess it is just that it has a hard time finding an audience. too heavy for nubes, too lacking for a seasoned group to pull out repeatedly. I love it, but others seem more tepid and that makes it hard to play enough.

This is my favorite co-operative game.  I do like pandemic alot, but it gets just a little repetitive and cumbersome always placing those cubes.  This game doesn't really have that yet all these legions and bad things keep piling up against you and you have to go to different missions to battle and beat them back.  The traitor adds a great variation to the game as you don't know if there is one or not.  The game actually is pretty simple but looks like it is complex.  Once you have the idea, it is an easy to play game.

In most games, players compete against each other to achieve victory. Shadows over Camelot proposes a journey of a very different kind, where you and your fellow players, as Knights of the Round Table, will collaborate to jointly defeat... the game!
At first glance, this task seems simple enough. After all, shouldn’t a band of young and noble Knights - fleet of foot and sound of mind - easily defeat a game that plays itself? Alas your quest is further complicated by the ever-present possibility of a Traitor in your midst, biding his time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment...
But enough words... Don your cloak, climb astride your warhorse and gallop into the Shadows to join us in Camelot!

Not sure if I like it more than LOTR, as a cooperative.  We've mostly played it with three, which might be part of the issue.  I want to be traitor! Hmm... now that I have the expansions, I definately think LOTR is the better coop game. UPDATE: Brought it out with a new group, who loved loved loved it. No longer for trade--they'd kill me. Still, for me the rating goes down.

played 6 x's.  Good with players new to this game, new to gaming, and/or when you're in the mood to sacrifice replayability for theme.  Fun but fades fast once you get it.  Great game to play with my kids and their friends.  

NEVER a good reason to place battle cards face up; take the extra card, traitor or not!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
First thoughts:  Fantastic.  Somehow better than Lord of the Rings, because the theme and the game itself are more open to interest from others.  Plays quickly and well, with enough battling the game, ability to try tactics and intrigue in the traitors actions to provide a great balance.
However, it takes a couple of plays for folk to understand the dynamic etc, which is needed before adding the traitor.  These couple of plays can make or break it for people and can feel like hard work.

Second thoughts:  Hard work to teach newbies.  Only really works when everyone knows what they're doing and when 7 people have that, is this the game they'll want to play?  Somewhere, this SHOULD be a great game.  Somehow, it just doesn't work out that way.  I'll keep trying tho and kinda like it...

Brilliant design, excellent production, perfect theme. Looks complicated but systematically easy to learn and manage. Gameplay involves teamwork, intrigues, and smart decisions. Suitable for more players, say 7. Repeated gameplay within the same game group will however make the interest level drops because players tend to cheat or exploit the game systems. Suggested to play with different game group, with guranteed fun and tension.
I give this game a decreasing rating. Hope a future expansion may address and fix the game problems.

Played twice (with four and five players) and really liked it. Ultimately, I think it is better that Lord Of The Rings (that other co-op game), mainly because you really feel like you are spreading your forces thin across many battles and constantly have to choose where to step in next. The art on the boards and on the cards is beautiful and the feeling of control is really much better than I anticipated. It is rock hard though...even without a traitor! I do have some doubts about its replayability.
UPDATE: After my third game, I had enough. Been there, done that. There are definitely better co-op games out there.

I wanted to like this game in the beginning, really wanted it, but not anymore. 5 plays later, this game is just too much hype. The cooperative mode is fine, but to expect people to kinda talk about what they have and try to conceal it is silly at best. In addition, the game is quite tough for newbies and losing in order to win the game is really bad. Hmm, on second thoughts, I think I will pass on buying this game.

OK, I finally manage to trade for this game and will give it another go. It can't be that bad, right?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Man, do I have mixed feelings about this one! On one hand, the overwhelming feeling of gloom and despair are really captured by the mechanics of the game: so much goes wrong or is just barely averted. 

On the other hand, the very fact that the game is about struggling vainly against overwhelming odds means that I hardly ever feel happy or accomplished when I play and win/lose. It's such a soul-crushing exercise in despair (even when you win a quest, it makes other bad things happen faster) that I hardly ever have fun. 

This wouldn't be a problem if I only ever played this and Red November (and even then, at least Red November is humorous!), but the fact that I can get better game play and a feeling of hope and accomplishment from Pandemic just makes SoC an absolute slog.

It's a well put together game, but it personally takes away any joy I have in playing games, which is the main reason I do so!

I thoroughly enjoy this game.  The traitor mechanic adds a lot in terms of the suspicion of other players.  Games are often, but not always, tense at times.  When this tension comes at the end of the game and you pull out a win, this game provides a game moment like few others.  
Be warned, though, this is not a pure strategy game - it is more of a cooperative adventure game in the style of Lord of the Rings (obviously) and Betrayal at House on the Hill.  If you're looking for something along the lines of Puerto Rico or Princes of Florence, this is not it.

With my group not being great fans of text, zombies or sci fi, this is our traitor co-op, though co-ops aren't really favored either. A decent game, not greatly interesting or exciting, and will rotate out at some point. Though I have no idea what would replace it.

Much as I like the competitive element of boardgames, I'm also a sucker for a good co-operative game, and SoC is most definitely a good one. Really well put-together game, theme is good and fits really well, some hard choices for players to make, and throughout you have the undercurrent of a possible traitor in your midst. Brilliant! I notice it's just picked up a Special Prize ('Best Fantasy Game') in the prestigious Spiel des Jahres awards for 2006 - well deserved IMHO.

RATING: 9.5
I absolutely love Shadows over Camelot. The reason why I like it so much is because of all the player interaction that is involved and the hesitations you have because somebody might be the traitor. 

Everybody is a knight of Camelot with a special role and you go out to compete task to get more white swords than black swords. Some tasks are solo while others are cooperative. It seems from the very beginning that things are going against you, however the game would be too easy if there wasn't a traitor. It's actually not that difficult to play the traitor however and you can be very subtle while still ensuring the other team loses. Each quest does not use great mechanics, most are either getting poker hands or discarding certain cards, but I don't think that's really the point of the game. 

The point of the game is trying to figure out who the traitor is because they are doing sketchy things and to try to explain why you are doing what you are doing. My favorite coop for sure. Been playing a bit much lately though, so will need to slow down as to not get burn out. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I played the game twice, each time with 7 players.  The knights lost both times, first due to lack of cooperation (no traitor) and second to wily play of the traitor snatching victory at the end.  Very much enjoyed it, look forward to our next session.

RATING: 8.5
Great game.  Gets better the more comfortable people are with it.  It can be a bit of a drag and baptism by fire for first timers.  

I have to agree with so many of the comments.  Beautiful, engaging game.  Fun, frustrating mechanics.  Rage inducing time wasting trying to tell if that one weird friend of yours is the traitor because he's behaving like he might be, but he may just be weird and WHY WOULD YOU BEHAVE THAT WAY IF YOU'RE A GOOD GUY, YOU JACK***!?!?!  

Very fun times.  Always excited to get it to table,  I bought it long ago based on reviews that called it "An Essential" for co-op fans and I think they were entirely correct.

I absolutely love this game and its artwork. Playing co-op adds such a different level of strategy and with so many ways of losing, you really need to work together. With shadows over Camelot i just think with so many different quests going on at the same time and every game its constantly changing counts for making it fun every time. it is possible to lose and win with any number of people. All adds up to one sweet game

RATING: 7
Seems like it should be fun but the last few times I've played it, it just left everyone feeling kind of disappointed. That was with 4 people. I think you've got to have 5 or more people for it to play well with the traitor. With 4 it's just too hard to overcome the traitor constantly adding catapults, and not that fun for the traitor to do the same thing each turn once they're discovered.
It can be fun to play traitor-less, but once you know the game well it'll be too easy.

It almost always makes for a light-hearted but tense game that everybody enjoys.  Great for introducing new gamers to the hobby, particularly those who have a predilection for fantasy themes.

(after 1 7p game)   7 Knights (all grown men), no traitor = 2 hours of fun.   If you like Knights and the Days of Wonder series, you'll really enjoy this one.    Would make a great game for a group of teenage boys.  Probably plays better with more players.   Want to play again - doesn't have to be right away since the rules are easy and the play aids with the game explain a lot.

[I never add it to the basic game]
I dislike it as much as I love the original game.
Mostly uninspired new kinghts, the Travel deck is just a bunch of random effects trying to remove some strategy from the game, the new Special cards are a varied mix (ranging from nice to decent to abysmal), Merlin is another random (and I suspect potentially abusable) feature.
Recycled artwork and little content for a vastly overpriced product.
After the long wait, it's a severe disappointment.

I'm a little torn as to how I want to rate this game.  It was fun, and I enjoyed the experience, enough to want to rate it a 7.  It just made me realize -- after thinking that the game had a similar feel to Arkham Horror and Pandemic -- that cooperative games are all similar in nature.  I suppose that's the nature of the genre, that you have to have bad events that pile up over time to make solving the game a challenge, but it makes me wonder what the next big breakthrough in cooperative games will be.  The traitor element makes it a little more interesting, but I wonder if there's enough that he can do to muck up the progress of the knights, since the knights won in the one game we played.

as i heard someone mention on an old episode of the dice tower, i'd rather this game always had a traitor instead of there just being a chance. even so with my group this game is way too susceptible to "do as one player says" and if you don't traitorous accusations abound. i'm always worried what will happen when that one player IS the traitor (so far it hasn't happened)
in the co-op genre battlestar gallactica is better if you want a traitor, if you don't want a traitor death angel is better.

My first three plays of this, with four players, were gripping. My fourth play, with six, was considerably less enjoyable; downtime increased, as did the interest of one's own role in the game -- with less players, each player has more demand to be flexible which leads to more involvement in the game. I think this plays well with four, and it's a good game, but I'm no longer sure that it's a /very/ good game.

In most games, players compete against each other to achieve victory. Shadows over Camelot proposes a journey of a very different kind, where you and your fellow players, as Knights of the Round Table, will collaborate to jointly defeat... the game!
\13\\13\
At first glance, this task seems simple enough. After all, shouldn’t a band of young and noble Knights - fleet of foot and sound of mind - easily defeat a game that plays itself? Alas your quest is further complicated by the ever-present possibility of a Traitor in your midst, biding his time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment...

But enough words... Don your cloak, climb astride your warhorse and gallop into the Shadows to join us in Camelot!

This is a fun co-operative game, and is fairly quick, compared to Lord of the Rings, and Arkham Horror.  Though I played with many groups, it seems to be straight forward once people grock the winning strategy, so it's more fun with inexperienced players, or with players who like to experiement.  As with all co-operative games, it's better to play with people who know all the rules, rather than playing with one person guiding everyone's actions.  Knowing the rules makes for informed participation.

Only played once. Has a lot of potential.
I need to play with a traitor to get the real taste. Meanwhile, a 7 to not drop the rating.
Update:
Played with the traitor, it was nice. Added another element of strategy to the game (which it needed). Sadly, the match drags a litte too long, and the rules about what can and cannot be discussed are terrible and poorly explained in the manual, which compromises the fun factor.

While trying to put into words why this game didn't work especially well for me, I realized why I like Pandemic so much. In Pandemic, you don't know exactly what's going to happen, but the reshuffling of the used cards to the top of the piles means you can make a reasonably educated guess. Shadows just feels extremely chaotic to me. I've never played with a traitor, and I'm frankly not sure I'd want to, as I've never beaten the game just by itself. There are a lot of good things going on, but I almost feel like it would've been better off focusing on on fewer quests (maybe with fewer possible players as well) and making it more attainable. I do like the triage feel to Battlestar Galactica, so I don't know if I can quantify why this one leaves me more cold, especially as I don't think it's a bad game, just not as good as the other options I've mentioned.

When I first started playing, I thought it was pretty awesome.  But the more I play, the more it seems that the order in which the black and white cards are drawn does far more to determine the winner than any amount of good or poor play on the part of players.

I like it enough to work through the various weird issues: messy communication rules, screwy incentives for the traitor, the endgame of winning by filling in black swords. In comparison to LOTR: not as complex, not nearly as deep, not as cooperative, not as thematic, not as tense, not as dramatic.  The biggest issue, though, is just how little there often is to do on your turn: there needs to be more options for participation. The expansion failed to touch this.

Despite all these things--and I hate that they're obvious--this is a good game. Everyone wonders a bit about the balance, the incentives, etc., but they've also demanded replays. Akin to Betrayal at House on the Hill, SoC is a truly great idea with some kinks in the execution. Some fan-based expansion ideas are really intriguing, and the game is malleable, which is a feature and a bug.

RATING: 6
This game can almost be treated as a party game since it plays so many and is so quick and easy to teach.  I think it's great, but all of the game's critics are right: The decision density is very low.  Over the course of the game you will have many turns in which you will not have to think very much at all.  The game is still very fun despite this thanks to the traitor mechanic, which adds a significant amount to the meta-game.

One other mechanic that I like is that, unlike many other co-op games, you get to choose your "evil action" each round (from three possibilities).  This adds some much needed decisions and gives the players more control, which is also very good.

Overall, the biggest problem to me is that the game is just too easy.  I read many reports by groups that have never won and it boggles my mind.  The traitor has won exactly once in about ten games for us, and games without a traitor are a breeze.  Are our traitors simply ineffective or does everyone else just waste too many actions?

I really do dislike this game.  It gives the illusion of activity, but your actions are pre-ordained for many turns when you show up at a quest.  Very few decisions, and what decisions you do have are dictated by the poker suits you have in your hand.  Yes, poker suits.  Did I mention the theme is non-existent?  Traitor aspect is the most interesting part of the game, and that doesn't salvage it.  The first time I played it, I was amazed that you actually would try to lose quests to end the game... This is a significant problem with the theme.  Communication rules are a serious mess also, people can't show each other their cards but they can talk in "code."  

Played 4 times. Bleh.

Very pretty game - Days of Wonder production quality is as usual thumbs up.  The beginning always feels fine,  buthen things start heating up.  Endgame is tight,  and I'm the traitor aspect makes things nerve-wracking.  The actual quests are just "play the poker hand",  the only die rolling is fighting siege engines in Camelot.  The table talk is always hilarious though,  especially when people get vocal about there accusations.  People's actions can get railroaded by too much "That's what the traitor would do" advice though.

Depth-wise,  the game is carried more as a group puzzle - individual actions are pretty small.  The die rolling is just a bit of extra annoying random factor.  The traitor hunting game is what carries it mostly - don't expect fancy strategic choices to carry the day.

Outside of Hanabi, this is probably one of my top co-op games.  There is an optional traitor element, which is always fun.  And the game is tough as nails.  I have heard great things about the Merlin expansion, but have yet to try it.  Word of advice… go ahead and just house rule in that you can say what cards you have.  The game is co-op, let it be full co-op.  That way you won't have to make up a code to communicate your hand.  

I have recently downgraded this game from an 8 to a 7.  I still enjoy the game, but there is just something about the poker hands in this game that just takes me out of it a little bit.  Still good, still recommended, but I may be moving on.

I like Camelot, but I like LotR better. Mostly because there is more tension in LotR. Trust me, this has nothing to do with the fact that I own LotR. Might go up .5 in ratings. I like it and will play anyone's copy, but won't buy it myself.

Played for the first time at BGG.con 2006. The game was fun and everything went great. But the traitor wasn't comfortable being the traitor... So she literally traded a card with me and then played the winning card that guaranteed a win for the rest of us. I'm sorry she didn't at least say "Hey, uh, I'm the traitor. Maybe I shouldn't play this game winning card. Would that be okay?"

This was my first try of a co-op. My impression is that interest in the game as a game lasts until one figures out how to beat the system. Of course, I have only played it once and so may be mistaken.

Still this game makes me even more skeptical than I was that co-ops are for me.

This is a very big and fun game. I can highly recommend it! 
I really like the idea of all players playing against [i]the game[/i] and not against [i]each other[/i], like you are used to! And to know that the player sitting right beside you can be the traitor gives the game a little extra spice :D

The first time I played this game there were seven of us (the maximum numbers of players). It had a little risk of getting dull when you had to wait so very long for your turn to come. So I would prefer 4-6 players !

Very good game.  Love the theme, and love the quality and look of the components.  I especially love the possibility, but not certainty, that there's a traitor in your midst.  I don't think it would be as fun if you were guaranteed to have a traitor in each game.

I have a slight concern that it might not have strong replay value, but so far it's been a lot of fun.

A cooperative game where you and your fellow players, as Knights of the Round Table, will collaborate to jointly defeat the game.

Alas your quest is further complicated by the ever-present possibility of a Traitor in your midst, biding his time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment...

Arthurian Co-op game.  Travel to different parts of the map and face various challenges using cards from your hand.  Attempt to cooperate with other players without being allowed to refer to your cards.  You lose if you fail a majority of your missions, if too many catapults gather outside Camelot or if everyone dies.  The game is set up to allow people to drop out or be dealt in at a moment's notice, which is quite nice.

RATING: 7
What sets this game apart is the traitor aspect (which has been used in many games since). There's plenty of options to sabotage, without it being too overly obvious.
I like that it takes a lot of people and just scales with it, and even allows people to just drop into the game after it's already started.

The first time I played this it was because two wonderful people we know brought this over for game night. Few of the newer co-ops can really compare. This is a beautiful game, with components I would be happy to just sit and look at.
As for the game, it is a co-op and one that holds its 'Arthurian' theme well. The prospect of a 'traitor' gives the game a new kick, but without it, the game still would hold a top spot on my best games list, if I had one, which I don't.
I would recommend Shadows over Camelot to anyone who looking to play a co-op game with a small or large group.

When initially unveiled, Shadows over Camelot was rightfully recognized as an impressive package that significantly broadened the cooperative genre.  Though largely a numbers game, SoC made tremendous thematic headway with its high-quality production, special powers, heroic actions, quest variety, tense discussion, and a traitor who can't wait to celebrate your death and failure.

As the traitor, though, I do wonder whether there's much to do besides dispensing bad advice in a convincing tone.  But hey, ask my wife: Questionable advice comes easy for me.

Finally, be sure to mind your manners and take the "keep it to yourself" rule seriously.  The games definitely loses its charm and respectability if players are permitted to hint at the contents of their hands.

Played several times (with 3 to 7 players). An interesting game, beautifully produced. I like that the traitor might be there - or not - however games without a traitor are probably less satisfying, at least for me.

I have played many times now and have enjoyed it each time. The traitor does win most of the time, but I have played where the board easily beat us with no traitor. The game is usually exciting because the players always seem to be one or two turns away from doom, so it is a constant challenge to turn the wheel before we plummet over the cliffs. :) - Lately my compatriates and I have beaten the game with no traitor, and I have finally donned the role (much to my happiness).

I like the theme a lot in this game and the idea that you are playing against the game itself.  Also, works well for larger groups and is easy enough for newer gamers to learn.  The downside is the group think.  You will likely have one or two players trying to tell the other players what to do because some strategies work a lot better than others.  Even if the more experienced gamers are not vocal, they will be frustrated by the actions of new players.  Often I don't know who is the traitor because many of the loyal players are playing (unintentionally) badly enough that they might as well be the traitor.

If you play with all experienced gamers, than it is too easy to win, without adding a lot of handicaps in which it becomes more a game of luck with the draw pile.

Game does a lot of things right, but ultimately falls into the "good" not "great" game category in my opinion.  I love the co-op & traitor element; however, it feels you are far more prone to the luck of the draw then you are an effective strategy.  Battlestar delegates this portion of this type of game better.

That said, it has great theme, components, good replayability and is generally a fun game.  Just not something I would tell someone it is a "must get" game.  You are not going to have a lot of reminiscing with a game like this as you would with Battlestar.

RATING: 7
A solid co-op game. You honestly don't even need/want the traitor in there unless you have 6-7 players (I guess 5 is acceptable). It is difficult enough. DOW, as always, knocks the production quality out of the park. So much theme, when you ARE the traitor, the slow build of revealing yourself is very nice. I will always be down for a game of Shadows Over Camelot.

Shadows over Camelot is, along with The Resistance and One Night Werewolf, by far the biggest hit with my friends. Co-op, not too hard of a game, stunning components and look, and (best of all) the potential of a traitor. There's a lot of talking, consulting, accusing and overal nonsense, and that makes it fun! Being able to play with 8 players is a good sign, as well as the possibility of people dropping out or coming in mid-game. Most of the time, people are constantly involved and turns often take just a few seconds. This is a great design. Too bad about the mediocre and disappointing expansion. I wish there would be another one, but that's probably never gonna happen. I'm actually messing around with some variants on my own, because I notice the game is getting rather simple for us, even with 2 traitors.

Disappointing.  Nice bits and presentation, but it can't hide the pointless, tedious gameplay (draw a card, move Excalibur, play a card, move Excalibur.  Rinse and repeat).  What could have been an epic adventure-style game is instead a dull exercise in card collecting.  

The best part of this game is that it finally does end.  Oh, and there should be agreement on the maximum number of bad misquotes of lines from the Monty Python film established before the game begins...

One of the better Days of Wonder games. This one also looks great, but - shock horror - actually has a game underneath the shiny exterior. The main problem for me is the traitor: why bother unmasking him, as that just tends to bring you a whole world of pain. Far better to leave him unmasked, but keep an eye on him.

This is what the LOTR cooperative game should've been.  Even without a possible traitor, this game is a blast to play and feels like there is an actual game with decisions going on, rather than people flipping over cards and watching something unfold as in LOTR.  The traitor is an awesome mechanic and was a lot of fun playing the one time I drew the card.  Top notch box, components, etc. too.  The only problem with the game is the difficulty, which is high by default and is raised to impossible if there is a traitor.  Once revealed, the traitor should also be much less powerful.

Difficult one to put my finger on.  At times it's a ton of fun, other times its more like an argument session, as everyone tries to make one another play the way they think the game will be best played - being a cooperative game and all.

The first two tries at this one resulted in frustration for the players. Unless the players understand how to make wise decisions and budget thier actions appropriately, things go down in flames quickly.

The game is at it's best with 5 or more people. The more the better, with 7 it's a great game for non-gamers, almost a party game.  Non gamers like the traitor dynamic and understand the poker-hand similarities in the combat quests.

With every play our group likes it more, provided we can get at least 5 to play.

(Trade Interest: low/medium, offervalue: 40) originally i liked this game even better than the LOTR coop game... but after times and a few plays, i find it a little boring.  the traitor aspect was a good idea, but seems poorly executed, and mostly just annoying.

It's an interesting entry level coop with a traitor element. It's not strategically challenging but it's theme carries enough weight to overcome that. Hand management is the only real challenge it feels like, even though you can lose to the enemy forces.

Large amount of game components, making setup a little bit of a hassle. Gameplay was reasonably straightforward. Replayability is suspect as the game revolves around figuring out the traitor and preventing him/her from causing too much damage.

I'm always going to prefer Battlestar Galactica, simply because it's more social, there's more ways to be shady beyond card-denial, and the evil players have to activily WORK to win the game whereas here it sometimes feels like the traitor wins by default. Plus, it's another one of sloppy rulebooks that I can't stand, made even worse by being triple-subdivided for no reason. Oh, and did I mention that its ruleset paints itself into some really strange corners: healing yourself by discarding identical cards that cant be verified because they have to be face down; and secrecy rules that defy all common sense.

And yet...there's no denying it's a trendsetter when it comes to Co-op with a Traitor Games, and it really looks fantastic on the table.

Cute, and reminiscent of Minion Hunter and LotR. Could be devilish fun with the traitor, but can see how new players mixed with experienced players would feel uncomfortable -- they "best" action being constantly pointed out, and the new player relegated to the role of a robot as everyone else makes his decisions "for the good of the team." Great production value, great theme integration... But definitely not for everyone. However, with a good group and the right attitude, a great experience.

What a great low complexity cooperative game, with a possible traitor. I think this must make a great family game, but have personally only played it with gaming buddies.

Another excellent co-op game, each player has to do his move the proper time in order all work together to keep Camelot without problems. One of my favourite board games ever, with beautiful board design and with the Merlin's Company expansion, the game becomes even better.
Highly recommended to everyone who like to work all together against the "system".

Shadows over Camelot is an awesome and fun game.  We played it 5 times in a row!  My wife extremely loves it and just wanted to keep on playing.  However, we played with 2 players and it felt extremely difficult to win.  We love that there is a lot more to do than Pandemic or Forbidden Island and never gets stale.

We played with an extra life per knight and we were able to win!

This game is the reason I started purchasing board games beyond Hasbro. A coop game with traitors, and the mechanics working against you, making it harder to achieve victory. Challenges and suspicion blended together, as well as a lot of talk to figure out the traitors. A definite must have, and one of the best board games that can carry over 6 players.

Fun game. Sucks to be the traitor, though, once you are revealed, since you have virtually nothing to do anymore in the game. I also dislike the poker-ish aspect of the game. But the rest is good fun, the special cards in particular.

I could take or leave this one.  The bits are great (Days of Wonder!) and you can't beat the theme... but I didn't really feel like I was on an epic quest, just that I was playing a really slow game of the card game war.  The heart of the game is in the player interaction though and I find I have more or less fun with this one depending on the group.

With the Merlin expansion, I am no longer worried about this game getting dull any time soon.  It is still a solid 8.

I really enjoy co-operative plays, this was a chaotic but decent first try.  The only thing I didn't like was having people that simply cannot remember the sequence of turns and thus had to ask what they should do every time.  It really prolonged the game unnecessarily and resulted in a lot of down time.  I can see replayability being a problem if your sessions are too close to each other, since the variety of quests, cards and actions are limited.  I'd imagine expansions may broaden the scope of the game, but for now I'm glad to own it and would definitely want to try this with different groups and players.

My first playing of this was tense, exciting and fun (I was the traitor and wasn't discovered until the very end).  I would have given it an "8".  The second playing wasn't nearly as fun.  The traitor was pretty obvious and was discovered early.  As a result, the game dragged on as we attempted to just fill the table with swords one way or the other (we already had enough to win).  Brings the rating down to a "6", and I'm glad I had this experience before I purchased it.  Now I don't feel as though I need to own it.

Lots going on, but a lot of times I felt like I wasn't really choosing what to do, but just doing what the cards I held allowed me to do.  In that sense it was less of a cooperative game and more of a game that plays itself out however the cards dictate.  The only wildcard is the traitor and in my opinion that just makes it more frustrating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is an odd one.  The traitor mechanic really is what makes this game good.  Without a traitor, the game makes a decent co-op game that gets easier the more players you add to the mix.  On the other hand, when you mix in the traitor, the group dynamic really changes.  
Great game,

This is a good game for a lot of people, but it has a snag to it.  I think that hard-core gamers won't be huge fans and casual gamers probably can't get a ton of enjoyment out of it.  But the traitor aspect is nice and adds a Battlestar Galactica element to it.

Definitely bad with low player counts.  Would almost say you have to play a full count to almost ensure the traitor is in the game.  Playing 3 was a total bore as we just assumed that no one was the traitor, and if we'd been wrong, the traitor would have won without difficulty.

A great theme and great looking board with an interesting twist involving a potential traitor in the midst.

Upgraded to a 9 - and then downgraded to an 8 again. I really like this one, but I want to like it more than it deserves. It's an interesting mix of abstract Eurogame mechanics onto a theme-heavy cooperative game, but the immersion when you play is weak and the number of choices you have on your turns are too few - if you already are on a quest, you just play another card onto it. Still like it, though.

I enjoy this game, when you first start playing it it's pretty hard, either people will solve one of the missions too fast and then too many catapults will be added, or they will ignore a mission and it will fail very quickly which has the same effect.  This game is all about finding the balance of pace along with team work.  We play where the only thing we can say about gameplay is what quest we are planning to visit, but not about what help you need or how long you will be there.  That small change stopped it from becoming too easy.  The fact that written on the card is the turn order and all the options in the order is great for helping new players, or players who are playing after a long break too.

Yuck, i soo wanted to like this game but it has only nice components. The game itself is boooring booring. You collect poker sets and pass half of your 5-sec lasting turns. Almost no decision-making and even the traitor's choices are mostly to *not* play a card and that's it... And btw: way too expansive. (and p.s. i gave it a lot of chances, we played it often to see if it was that bad - but my group agreed: no one liked it)

Кооперативная евростратегия. Есть и тема, есть предатель, есть и механика.

Cooperation game in which you can play as a famous knight of the round table. One of the knights can be a traitor, which adds a paranoid element to the game.  Great components and good theme. 

This is one of the best coop games for new players. 
After several plays I however see some problems the game has : 

*deterministic roles of some knights (blue is especially prone to this) 
*quest balance : whoever goes to fight the black knight is doing kind of a traitor action. 
*the game says you can't say what's in your hand, but allows to give hints, basically telling what's in your hand. I feel that the less talk there is the better the game gets.

Pros:

Excellent components and artwork.

Plays up to seven players.

Well executed co-op mechanics with the chance of a traitor (which I like even better than knowing there's a traitor, like in Battlestar Galactica).

Cons:

The mechanics for much of the cardplay feel like glorified poker hands. The transparency of the combinations shows too well, is what I mean: 2 pairs, full house, straight...

The game can feel slow. When your entire turn could literally be "travelling" (i.e., pick up your figure and put it right back down again in a new spot, nothing else), it can try your patience to have to wait for everyone else to play before you can actually DO something.

Only played once so far, with 7 players, and on the quite literally fabulous board that is more at home at a miniatures convention, but this is a brilliant game (which I bought directly after playing).  At one point there was no way we'd loose, then the traitor revealed himself and there was no way we'd win, and it went back and forth like this until the traitor finally got us.  Damn him  :)  Superb game

Edit: Several more plays now with a variable number of players, and each time it has been a hard fought battle and thoroughly enjoyable.

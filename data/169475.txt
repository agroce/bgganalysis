RATING: 10
The artwork in this game is amazing and the 3D ghosts are just super rad! As a big fan of ghostly things like Scooby Doo and The Ghostbuster, I just love this game!

Each day a bunch of guests book into a Haunted Hotel which has nine rooms. Each player plays a ghosts (Red, Blue, Black, or White) and each night they attempt to scare off as many guests as they can, earning themselves spookie points. This is done by the players rolling dice to inflict terror onto the guests. Even the most fearless of guests may have a hidden fear or phobia which can be used to the ghosts advantage. There are a bunch of other helpful mechanics in this game such as Scare Tactic Cards, Spookie Favour Cards, Terror Bonus Cards, Phobia Tokens and Ghostly Barrier Tokens. Players use their earned spookie points to purchase these extra special abilities.

When there are not enough guests left to fill all of the rooms, that is when the game ends. The ghost with the most spookie points wins.

Ghostel is a great group game to play. Easy to learn and fun. Winning relies on luck and strategy. Your dice rolls will help you to gain points but if you only relying on getting the top score you can miss out on the points for second and third/fourth place.

I recommend playing with a group who are willing to be a bit silly and make ghost sounds as they move across the board.

Novel dice-placement game.  Looks lighter than it is, there is more to it in terms of strategy.  Solo mode should make this a nice, relaxing game to unwind with.

Surprisingly great game.
I thought this looked fun, but it is much more than that, lots of depth and can be almost chess like in parts. Many cool cards to break rules. 
Reminds me a bit of Monsters Inc...... "we scare because we care!"

Great fun game.

Nice easy gateway game. Enough strategy and complexity that I enjoyed it, while still keeping a fair aspect of chance for those more used to that style of play. Surprisingly cooperative feel to it as well.

A goofy art game with interesting theme.
The mechanics are quite simple that anyone can learn them and play fast.
Since it is cooperative it is interesting the combinations one can do.
Quite a nice game that I backed on Kickstarter.

Nice majorities die rolling game, where players are ghosts trying to scare guests out of a haunted hotel.  Players take turns placing three dice in any of nine hotel rooms, each inhabited by a guest.  If the dice total exceeds the fear value, the guest flees, payout out points based on pip totals to the players.  It reminded me a lot of Blue Moon City, with players cooperating, and alliances are rising and falling, and was kind of fun.  However, it suffers from the same issues as games such as Stone Age - you MUST roll well or you are doomed.  It felt long too, but we may have been playing with too many guest cards in the deck.

I enjoy the idea of trading points for benefits, but the game really feels like it's just getting going, and it's over. A little too formulaic for my taste.

One I see hitting the table often in the future - easy to teach, fun to play. A clever mix of helping each other out, whilst still riding your "teammates" achievements to victory!

Somewhat luck based, but that doesn't stop strategy from coming in. For example, one turn I had (by far) the lowest value "terror dice" - a 3, a 1, and a 1 - but by playing them strategically on cards other people were focusing on, I ended up earning more points than any one of them did that turn.

Would DEFINITELY recommend.

A highly enjoyable game that's easy to learn and also has enough room for strategy to be accessible to players of a wide range of skill levels.

The artwork is stunning and the game has great replay value (plus those 3D ghost meeples are adorable!)

To a certain extent it does come down to dice rolling. Cards can help or not really. Mostly I use them to change when I start compared to others. I would love to dig down into this further strategy wise. I have lost 3 times by under 3 points.

Too heavy to be a gateway game yet too simple for a gamers game. I'm not sure who it is aimed at.

RATING: 7
First Impression: Ghostel is a light and fun game, but also really solid. My ranking is based on how much I want to play it, given my penchant for heavier games. For a gateway or family game, it is really good and the theme (tongue-in-cheek spooky, not horror) is one that should resonate with a lot of audiences. I am sure to get many more plays with some of my more novice gaming partners and would recommend it to anyone looking for lighter fare. That cultist John looks like he isn't going to spook easily.

RATING: 7
A cute little 2-4 player worker placement game.  The theme and heavy pieces really shine.  Although the theme is 'scary', it's appropriate for all ages.  As for the gameplay, nothing groundbreaking, but definitely a solid combination of mechanics that keeps the game interesting enough.  Would definitely recommend for 3 or 4 players, not so much for 2 players (it's just 4-player mode, which each person controlling two ghosts).

Really enjoy this little game. It is easy to learn and fun to play. My whole family plays and loves it. It is fun at any time but real good to play around Halloween. Get that Ghostie in there and scare away those pesky guests.

Not a bad game, more interesting with 4 players, some thought required with added chaos added. Light and fun.

An awesome game! Pretty fun with two players, but I bet it would be even better with three or four. I love the ghosts and the artwork! Gameplay is quick and strategic, but not paralyzing.

This is a good family weight area control game (with exploding bases, as per Smash-Up/Guilds of London). I think some of the cards are simply more powerful than others and with bad luck, you can easily end up left behind. The fact you can spend points to buy cards could have meant a toss up between gaining cards, or keeping points. But really, except very late in the game, as long as you have enough points, you'll always spend the maximum on cards every turn.
A bit too random for me to play as a strategic game. But it's good light fun and ideal for Halloween. You can easily add extra players with a few spare dice and an extra row of cards under the board.
Includes cultists expansion and creepy girl (name escapes me) promo

This has been a game that we go for just about every chance we can.  My wife and I love the two player variant and it's been great when we've had more around the table as well.  It's straight forward, yet has a lot of fun strategy.  It's definitely turning into one of our go to games!

Que jogão!!! Tinha tudo para não interessar: Tema no universo do fantástico, dependência linguística (que até é muito pouca e dispensável), mecânica essencialmente baseada no lançamento de dados e ser carote. Surpreendentemente, Ghostel revelou-se um jogo contagiante, bastante estratégico e diferente de tudo o que já viramos, além de ter uma arte bestial e uns fantasmas do melhor que por ai se encontra. Irresistível!

The quality of the elements in the game are so nice - really love the 3D ghost player tokens! Game play is a lot of fun and the artwork is great, too. Also glad to receive the Cultist expansion, which can give you a bit of an edge so make sure you play with it! 

The only downside for me is that it's 4 player max, really wish it was 5! :)

Great dice placement for family's and a bit of crunch for gamers. Outfox your opponents and attempt to be the scariest ghost of them all. Guests have scare values that need to be achieved. Ideally you want to be the only presence present.
Cooperation is needed though to bag the big points. Game bending cards add another spice to this spooky speculation scare fest.

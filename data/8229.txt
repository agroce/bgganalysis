Clever, fast game that manages to feel tense and fun.  I like the simplicity of the design and speed of the game.

Is it my imagination or are a lot of hidden numerical value games cropping up all of a sudden?  Classics like Y's are being supplanted or supplemented by Francis Drake and Armadora.

RATING: 6
Light, quick game with bluffing and screw-your-neighbour elements.  For what it is, slight danger of AP due to (i) some tactical depth in fence placement (which I like) and (ii)  whole-game bluffs: counters are placed face down and revealed only at final scoring (which I dislike).

RATING: 5
I played this game in its rethemed edition: I understand why a publisher would want to do this, but the game worked perfectly fine as a pure abstract without such overt visual candy. The basic idea is simple: players fight over the control of gold mines where a fixed amount of gold is to be had. You can think of this gold simply as VP as you don't actually do anything with it. On your turn you either place closed influence somewhere on the board, or up to two wooden fences which create areas including the gold mines, and limit the reach of the placed influence at the same time. It's adaptive gerrymandering without really knowing where the population to gerrymander is—not something you see every day. You cannot divide an area smaller than 5 squares any further: this is an obvious measure to prevent destructive race-to-the-bottoms which would seal off the mines for all involved. The game ends when players pass.

It's rather a devellish choice you're faced with at the beginning of the game because you simply have to guess what the final configuration will look like, so it's best not to pull out the big guns straight away. This creates a good 'story arc' to the entire thing. The only disadvantage I experienced was that the amount of closed influence gets so large at some point that it becomes hard to keep track of it. I'd like to think that an Ys-like solution, where half your influence is closed and the other half is open, works better here... but perhaps it doesn't because it becomes fairly easy to calculate what you need to win a specific area.

In the advanced variant some mildly asymmetric powers are introduced which give the game a bit of bite. They won't destabilise matters, but they will cause some areas to behave a little differently from the rest, which is a nice touch the design can easily cope with. 

All in all a nice little game. I might purchase it one day.

Components: Sturdy wooden pieces, a nice board, and thick tokens. I think that there should either be artwork and pieces to support the gold-mining theme, or that the theme should be dropped and the game be as abstract on the box as in play.

Experience: A nice game of tactics, with a few clever moves to be made along the way. The small board and abundance of tokens make for an interesting mix of placement, timing, and bluff.

But mostly random, and mostly boring.

The decision making in the game is incredible given how few options you have each turn.  Every little move matters, and the bluffing mechanic also adds a fun twist.  This is one of our staple "15 minute games" and we almost never play only once.  My only true complaint about this game is that I always need to flatten the board out for a few minutes with some heavy books before we play.

Played 10+ times. Good little filler game that is more than the sum of its parts. Why oh why did this game opt for such an abstract look? It claims to be a "mining" game, so why not give us little pastic mountains instead of wood cylinders, and miner graphics on the back of the chips? That little tweak would have made this an ideal introductory game, but, as is, sinks down to mere "good filler". And the drabness makes it hard to convince people to try it! I am going to redraw my own map...

Formerly known as Nuggets, Armadora is an area control game by blind bidding tile placement. Armadora is an upgraded edition from Nuggets. In Armadora, there are four different racial special features. However, the basic mechanics are still the same. It is ok game, just not my cup of tea. I like open area influence mechanic more.

I bought it because it was on clearance and so I didn't expect much from it.  So I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  It's a small and quick area control game with just enough strategy to piss off your opponents.  It's possible to totally ruin someone's strategy with the perfect FU wall placement. And the end of the game has a nice reveal moment to show who wins a territory.  It's the right size and right level of complexity for a fun, and quick game.

The drawback to this game is the lack of variety in the starting board.  There needs to be some way to randomize the starting locations of the gold.

Decent fun and plays fast. But... rules as written support the two player game. The 4 player game is lacking. They probably could've fixed this by including a double-sided board. One side with big squares for 2 players, one with smaller but more numerous squares for 4 players.

Racial powers are good fun though.

Potentially a fantastic little game, let down (as "Nuggets") by atrocious material design. Unfortunately the remake "Armadöra", while better looking, is no improvement at all. By fixing the gold squares (they are now always the same) it takes away most of the variety and fun. The idea of special powers and reinforcements leaves me cold, too (luckily they can just be ignored). It is frustrating to see what is essentially a gem of a game ruined by bad decisions. Done properly, I would rate this a "9".

An area control game with okay components.  I wouldn't beat down the door to play this game, but I also wouldn't object to playing the game if someone else brought it to the table.

The game in its basic mode is really quick, but it does have some substance once you add in the more advanced rolls.

(I do wish the board would lay flat.  The bends do make the pieces more likely to slide and position is important)

It is simple enough in that you really only have two moves to choose from per turn, but what you can do with those two moves can get you thinking. Played well with 2 but better with 3-4. I would have paid $15 for this after playing it.

A very sweet little game. A 2 player filler favorite. It is like Samurai but better, since there is no randomness and instead a nice bluffing element. I don't mind the naked appearance at all, there are so many bad games with nice graphics out there that I find it refreshing to play a good game with poor graphics for once, like a glass of cold fresh water after a long day eating nothing but chocolate.

Update: After 20 more plays or so I raise this from 7 to 10 for being best in its category, that is, a hidden-information 2-player abstract strategy game

Update: My comment about the simple graphics refers to the first "Nuggets" version obviously, not the "Armadöra" version.

You either play your face-down tiles (with strength points) or play two fences, the aim being to form fenced-off corrals (2 fences per turn) that will contain the victory point gold mines and just enough more strength than your opponents in that corral to win the VPs. It's a game of hoping that you've guessed right where everyone's played dummy low-strength tiles and where they've played their higher strength tiles. There's plenty of pussage with placement of the fences, splitting opponent's tiles from the gold mines, and occasional opportunity for a clever placement which guarantees things, but it's a 10-15 minute opener in the main that doesn't provoke a lot of replay due to its reliance on guesswork. Best with 4 where you can share the joy or the pain with a partner.

I've only played this w/ two, both in person and a ton on boardgamearena.com. It is rules light (which I enjoy and appreciate) but also a fairly thinky, abstract style game. There's tile lying, area enclosure, bluffing, and variable player powers (in the "advanced" rules) mechanics. It just works. And it's pretty damn fun to boot. I use numbered yellow chits instead of the provided wooden cubes because this way with two the set-up and minimal bookkeeping is better -- tied mines don't need to be split and can merely be discarded. The fantasy theme, artwork, and component quality are all good. The game is presented in a small, well constructed box, which is a huge plus in my book.

Very abstract game of enclosing areas and claiming them with your various-valued chips.  Played 2- and 3-player, and we enjoyed both.  Simple elegant rules; interesting strategy and tactics.

A quick abstract game that's easy to learn and fairly fun.  Not my favorite genre, espcially since I'm geometrically challenged, but I enjoyed the bluffing aspect enough to elevate it above most games of this type.  I can see how Nuggets would appeal more to some gamers.

Picked up at B&N this year (2016) during their 50% off Red Dot Sale. I have heard Blue Orange games were on the rise however this one is one of their older game so I'm not sure what to expect. 

For $12 I will give it my best shot.

Early rating after one playing.  Enjoyed the partnership game.  The choice between playing two boundaries or one number tile turns out to be an interesting one.

[Winning Moves 2003 edition] {Gold digging; area-control with dynamic territory, secret unit} Nuggets is a small area-control game with bluffing element. It is accessible for different kinds of players even though the theme is very thin. It has good player interaction - players have to react promptly after other players's moves. Players have many decisions each turn but the decision tree is not huge and shrinks as the game progresses; therefore it's fast-paced. It's fun because players can bluff. Sometimes, a player may scream when he find that his opponents win a gold nugget by 7:2 or lose a gold nugget by 3:4.

Nuggets is one of the good backpack games :)  I can take it during travel although the sticks may move on transports.

If you like bluffing and area-control games, you should get this one. Otherwise, you may skip it.

A very small, simple area control game with surprisingly meaty, tense, and highly interactive gameplay. It packs as much punch in 30 minutes as other games do in two hours. This game is the real deal.

RATING: 8
Very surprising game.  It doesn't look like anything but there's a lot of chicanery in this small box.  You will routinely be causing problems for other players.  The board is small so confrontation is unavoidable.  This feels a lot like a Knizia design to me for some reason.

Quick little game of staking your claim, but beware of what your opponents might be doing. You have an interesting decision on some turns because you may either place one of your markers or place 2 barriers, but not both.

Blackrock continue to release clever fast little games and Armadora is another in that streak. A little bit of bluffing and guesswork and some clever tactical play make this a charming little entry.

I'm curious to see how the special abilities impact the game now.

[thing=8229][/thing] is a simple area control/influence and enclosure game, in which players put tokens in order to claim areas with gold, as the player with the most gold in the end will win. The actions in the game are: either put one token (hidden) on the board, or put 1 or 2 fences in order to delimit the area of influence for one or more of the places with gold. The limited area can't have less than 4 spaces, but can have more. Mostly like a hidden [thing=3][/thing] game, the players have the same units - several with power 1, some with 2, and one with 3 and one with 4. So, the you will want to take the most gold, and block the other players tokens to reach the most valuable areas by putting a fence between them and the area. Though, since the area can't be smaller than 4 spaces, this means that, in most places (if not all) there will be fight for the gold. Also, while the area is still "open" (not surrounded with fences - the outer areas of the board are considered "closed"), players can add a +1 power token to a unit (this doesn't count as an action) and, if playing with the special powers of the races, the player can also use them.

[thing=8229][/thing] should be played quickly, as you really doesn't have all that much information in order to nitpick and try to maximize every single action made, as the units are hidden. You only know that there is a unit there, and from which player it belongs to, but that is it. Still, for some reason, there are room for AP, as I came to found out, while a player can be pondering which unit to pick, the size of a area, where to put fences, and basically this. I won't say this will be the normal play, but sure can happen, sadly.

The bits of the game are good - and the box is properly made, being really portable. 

The gameplay is smart, light and tense, with the climax coming in the final reveal of the tokens - and I like when a game locks your attention until the very end of it - a player can't never be really sure if he is going to win until, well, he won, or lost. However, we played with the special powers for the races, and these seemed unbalanced: the elfs, being able to lower the value of two units is way better than the mages, that can look at two hidden units, and the goblins, that can put one extra unit, but face up. Can't say if this is game breaking, probably not, but there is proper scale in them, so I don't recommend playing with the special powers (or, if you want to, make the elf being able to shoot only once, not twice in a game).

Gameplay is like a hidden and simpler [thing=3][/thing].

Overall, [thing=8229][/thing] is a fine game - fun, engaging, quick to teach and to learn, with good bits, and all in a small box. Basically is a filler with meat on the bones - at least if played properly - meaning: fast play, not overthinking every move.

Would definitely play again should the occasion arise, but between this and [thing=142326][/thing], the latter is superior, and fills mostly the same slot. Still, players have, even with the hidden information, more control, as they have access to every piece and the area of influence for the gold are defined by the players - these points could make [thing=8229][/thing] a better fit for some groups.

Excellent filler boardgame. Play well with 2P, 3P, and 4P, giving very different gaming experiences. Clever use of bluffing element in a area majority game. The partnership game with 4P is trick, which you want to team with your partner at a balance of disclosing your secret deployments. Great quick game, with tactics.

quick and simple tactical 2p game (that can be played with more ^^)
the game has good flow (at the begining you study what the opponent is doing, double-guessing, then theres a race to block/close areas and get your best tiles in the best spots there, and tension is there for the final reveal), and is less luck dependant than other 2p games (Jaipur, Lost Cities & co)

[+] easy to teach, fast play, good flow
[-] don't care much for 3/4p

Perhaps one of the best Quality-Price game I've ever seen. Its components are not pleasing, but they are entirely functional. It's an area enclosure game, with lots of bluffing. Fun with 3, enthralling with 4. Its price should make it a must have.

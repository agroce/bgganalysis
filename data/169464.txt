My husband and I gave "each other" games for Christmas - a new tradition - and this is one I put on my wish list. We both love Pandemic and this looked like it had a fun, engaging theme. One play under our belt. We won even though we realized we had cheated here and there a little bit (it happens while we're learning) but I still count it as a win.  We enjoyed ourselves but ultimately felt like we didn't need to play it again.

Kickstarter edition with bonus quests, extra Ranger characters, and the custom dice pack. I laminated the mission sheets. A great game if you're a fan of Defenders of the Realm or post-apocalyptic games. It's easy to fan-mod for creating Fallout, Mad Max, or Gamma World variants.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent retheming of Defenders of the Realm, and they've added more to do which really fleshes out the setting and gives you so many more options in how to take down the enemy bosses. The components and art do feel a little more dated than some other apocalyptic games of late, but I wasn't at all unhappy with the components, and once players learn their actions it feels fresh and intuitive again, with a good balance of the random Raider draws and ways to mitigate yourselves against them. One of my favorites of 2016 thus far.

RATING: 7
Essentially the same game as Defenders of the realm. It has a little more story focus and I really like the addition of the mutations.

But all in all: You should your game according to the theme that appeals more to you. Mad Max theme -> go for Last Stand.
Fantasy: Go for Realm.

Both are excellent coop games. Check them out.

EDIT 2017: Last Stand is a little bit more swingy according to its difficulty. All in all it feels a little bit easier than REALM.

So all in all, Defenders of the realm is the better game for me. More brutal, it escalates much faster, more content to add and cooler heroes.

Nonetheless Last stand is not a Bad game at all. It adds cool New features and let players enjoy the adventure aspect of it. But it has to be less punishing to achieve that and that is the biggest Problem I have with the game in the longrun.

2017 Second impressions. Eleven plays in and still enjoying this game. This game combines 2.0 improved DoTR mechanics with lots of added on chrome (mutations, artifacts, scavenging) with a post apocalyptic universe dripping with theme and bigger, badder looking bosses.  The chrome gives more room for tactical choices and character growth during gameplay, but preserves the simplicity and quick pace of the Defenders system.  Plays a bit long (3 hrs avg for me) and game marred by typos and some subpar minis (the bosses are good though).  Honestly, my biggest gripe is we may not see all of the additional content Richard had developed for this game (Rangers, extra adventures and item cards, alternate generals and an extra Raider faction).

This is a good "American style" game with lots of minis and enemies who never stop coming where the players cooperate to keep the enemy forces cut back while working toward a greater goal. Well constructed, fun, and the minis paint up well.

It's a ramped up Defenders of the Realm, with elements similar to those of Eldritch Horror and Shadows of Brimstone.  So Defenders of the Realm, but with gear and mutations and adventures and unique and common items.  A mashup, but a pretty fun one!

Update: Played a second game, and it was a blowout for the good guys.  Need to play more to see if it's too easy or not.

Seems to do what mansions of madness would like to do, tell a story but let the players feel like they are in control and developing the story.  

In this game you can explore, fight, travel, work on objectives in the order you want.  I singer turn leaves with with many good options and a story develops around that. 
 
Unlike Mansion of Madness were you enter a room and pick in which order you want to look at different things in the room.  No meaningful way to choose and dosent make much difference in what you choose.

On the negative side: the plastic mini smell bad and the bright color hurt my eyes and conflict with the theme, the board art is boring but functional.  The other game art is better.

This has some production funkiness & sloppiness that reminds me of Earth Reborn in so far as the graphic design, manual & card layout, & straight up typos can blur the line between being thematically faithful to the trashy material but also just looking amateur and interfering with learning & absorbing the game. 

Underneath the funky layer and the kaleidoscope of Eklundesque typography is a very smart, evocative mashup of Pandemic (or Defenders of the Realm) and a Runebound style adventure system tied to a strongly implemented and mostly well written post apocalyptic theme.

I think the Pandemic framework can come close to feeling like a chore at times, interfering with (rather than fueling) the rest of the interesting pieces of the game, sort of outwearing its welcome, cracking under the weight of the more interesting material bolted onto and around it.

But I'm a Runebound fan, so I may be more interested in the "adventurey" parts of this game than was entirely intended in the design. The whack-a-raider certainly lends urgency to the game, and wiping enemies off of the board while making your way to a mission or boss and blowing up weapon depots along the way hasn't gotten old yet, but it often feels like a noose that chokes off the exploration aspect of the game particularly with fewer players.

I'd probably get to explore more of the adventure side of it if I were more comfortable with gauging the urgency of the Pandemic layer, knowing when I either have some breathing room or can work with both systems more effectively. I also think it's mostly designed as a 4-player game, which is unfortunate since I don't really have a 4-5-player group that would play something like this.

Edit 8/2017: Looking back at this game, I'm pretty sure I don't need to play it again considering how much mileage I've gotten from Runebound and Gloom of Kilforth, and the upcoming promise of FFG's Fallout.  Also, after the KS fulfillment afterglow has worn off, I've gotta say that this game really does not present itself well at all. It's a big box of ugly. I think it'll be taking the walk of shame soon.

what if fallout and mad max kind of postapocalypse genres decided to create a broard game? here we are with Defenders of the Last Stand, a postapocalyptic coop game wich puts the player in the clothes of rangers who try to defend what they think is the last spot on earth of human society and culture from 3 raider gangs and the mutants of course. each enemy faction is lead by a powerfull characther that the ranger must battle in order to succede. In the meanwhile the world is irradiated by the remnants of the atomic fallout left by the bombs and rangers must face even this while adventuring in old cities and abandoned places in search of old prewar artifacts and things that will help them in their survival. a great game playable even in solo but I recommend at least 3 players

This game was really fun. There are some apt Pandemic comparisons here, but the various "diseases", in this case post-apocalyptic factions of warriors, really have a lot of personality.

RATING: 7
Pretty good, but always felt like a bit more trouble than it was worth.

Heavily based on the Pandemic system, but with all sorts of thematic add ons to reflect the post-apocalyptic setting. This sounds fine in theory, but what you end up is Mad Max's Interceptor designed by Homer Simpson. The  elegance of the underlying game is dragged down by the insistence on adding as many bells and whistles as possible.

The additions are mostly pretty neat in isolation, but taken together it all gets a bit exhausting. Missions, that's cool. Adventures, kind of the same, but with different rules, that's cool too. Mutations, also very cool. Four different gangs, each with different personalities and rules. Yeah, that's cool. That's everything though, right? My head's starting to spin. No son, there's also gear cards, and relics, and monstrosities that all have unique powers. As long as the rules keep everything ticking along though, we'll be fine. Yeah, sorry, the rule book is pretty shocking.

That's a lot of chrome, but underneath, you're still pretty much playing a version of Pandemic. And it's one where the random interaction between the different systems can suddenly land you in the s**t, much more quickly and irretrievably than I'm comfortable with.

If you like the idea of a solid chassis with a ton of crazy extra bits welded on to it, then this might be up your alley, but for me, the search for the perfect post-apoc board game continues.

Think Pandemic, but you can do what you want. Go on an adventure and find a ancient artefact. Spend an action to go gambling to win more attack cards. Sabotage the leader of the biker gang. Eventually though you'll have to takeout the oncoming bad guys with a combination of dice rolls and card played from your hand. Like Pandemic, things can go bad quickly. 
It's a great game for the right group. It's never boring, but it's a long game. Also there's quite a lot of little rules, so someone really needs to commit to getting on top of the rule book and FAQs. And you all have to commit to the theme, dig the fluff - it's a core part of the game. This is high Ameritrash. I'm a big fan.

RATING: 3
As my other comments for coops. If game does not have either great theme or some other means to mitigate typical problems of coops (alpha player or fact that your actions are too obvious) it is not much fun.

this is somehow also plagued by graphical presentations which ranges from very good to really ugly (some cards), miniatures are mainly ugly without detail.

theme is not bad but sometimes stories are too silly...

I would probably enjoyed it few years back but I have changed my taste since then and games like Dead of winter, Kingdom Death, BSG give me much more enjoyment.

Re-implementation of Defenders of the Realm.

Defenders of The Last Stand is a post apocalyptic adventure game by Richard Launius (Arkham Horror, Run Fight or Die, Defenders of the Realm) and Jason Maxwell (Agents of SMERSH, Superhero Solitaire) for 1-5 players set in the Western United States more than 50 years after nuclear war. Players take on the roles of Defenders of the last known haven for humanity, called The Last Stand. Four outside clans leaders, along with their followers, advance toward the town, and players work cooperatively to defend The Last Stand. Menacing mutants also roam the desert threatening the city's survival.

Juegazo, gané la primera partida (a 2 jugadores) pero desde entonces se me ha resistido (a 2, a 4 y a 5). Veo un poco de mezcla de mecánicas de Pandemic y Eldritch, y me encanta. Me gustaba el puntito canalla de su predecesor por lo de semicooperativo, pero el habérselo quitado lo hace más lógico. Muy recomendable.

This is basically Pandemic heavily re-themed/chromed with adventuring included. Box is huge, plastic figures are low quality but sufficient. It was fine, but I probably would not have purchased it if I realized it was a Pandemic "clone". Moved it right along after my first play which was decent but a bit on the long side.

Like Defenders of the Realm (and very similiar to Pandemic), just a bit more complicated in every regard. Four different enemies, but one of them has special rules. More actions than with DotR, but you need the right cards. No improvement.

Great gameplay and story make up for sub-par minis. It's a romping adventure through the post-apocalyptic American west with unique good guys taking it to tribal leaders hell-bent on destroying humanity's last stand. It's based on the Defenders of the Realm mechanics, a mature engine that works hand-on-hand with the theme. Wonderful game!

This was a fun trip down memory lane for me. I used to love Defenders of the Realm, and Defenders of the Last Stand is essentially the same game with a different theme and some slight rules tweaks. My two favorite rules additions are the mutations, which allow you to push your luck for cooler player powers, and the ability to "sabotage" bosses by hurting them without having to fight them. Unfortunately, a lot of the reasons why I got rid of Defenders of the Realm are present here as well; long setup time, living and dying by the dice rolls, the cards just not going your way, etc. While I think this is the better game of the two, I think I appreciate Defenders of the Realm a bit more because the theme felt more fully-realized, strangely enough. This is a great co-op game, but I'm just not always up for a 2-hour co-op anymore unless it's going to keep me engaged the entire time.

Has a nice retro feel despite the bad artwork and the miniatures do not raise up to current standards. But the game got me. Great implementation of the post-apocalyptic theme, using a functional system. Provides good entertainment. I do feel the game might take too long with more than 3 players. Overall it creates a nice Mad Maxian story. Would be nice if some expansions were added. A definitely underrated coop. The rulebook is frustrating. Some rules are missing and some aspects are unclear. You'll find clarifications on BGG, though.

After one play, the game is really fun and the post apocalyptic theme (which I love)is carried well. It does suffer from some of the fiddly rules issues that can be found in other Launius games, but I happen to love most of his games. The minis aren't the best, but they serve their purpose, but some of the rules and components have typos (Hard Road being called High Road, characters referred to by wrong names, etc.) which is odd for an otherwise well produced game. I anticipate enjoying the game even more with further play, as our first play was slowed down considerably to refer to the manual. The inclusion of multiple scenarios increases the variety and replayability for a game that already has so many moving parts to make games play out differently every time. I only wish I had the Kickstarter version with the additional Rangers to choose from.

I usually don't rate unplayed games, but after opening the box and seeing the mediocre (but not outright bad) art and fugly minis (and I'm a sucker for minis), it tipped the scale for me. The mechanics weren't really my thing in the first place. I had hoped for more of an adventure game than a Pandemic variant, and although I realize that the good fluffy stuff is probably in the card decks (which I didn't break), my lukewarm response to the game combined with (to me) lacklustre aesthetics made me realize this game will never get any table time. Returned to the store.

My son enjoys this one a lot, however, I am not happy with the minis.  These aren't the quality of minis I'd expect from something made after say 2005, much less 2016.

Ameritrashers take a lot of heat for fiddly games, but we always had great miniatures and art to make up for it. Not here. Pastel colors on a board that is supposed to be an apocalyptic wasteland? Minis with quality that is barely above drug-store plastic army men?

One play so far, but enjoyed it a lot. Very flavorful. I was concerned it might seem too like Pandemic, but found the theme, missions, artifacts and adventures add a lot of options to the game that elevate it nicely. Definitely would play again and might be on the lookout for my own copy.

Needed a publisher to come in and clean it up, and cut the playtime down.

:) Theme that works great
:) Cool story missions
:) Easy to understand actions
:) Sandboxy, so a ton of replay value and potential for endless scenarios

:):soblue: Minis are a true mix bag. Some look great. Some are really poor and should have never been approved 

:soblue: Atleast 1/3 longer than it needed to be
:soblue: Player scaling seems poorly done
:soblue: I'm always gonna prefer no more than 3 players
:soblue::soblue: Rule problems and typos galore. They sadly left things in the game that were removed. So it feels like a beta in some ways

This is an exceptionally difficult game - to the point where all of the players (some of whom were experienced coop players) suggested it wasn't possible to win. I think we probably got a rule wrong, so I'm going to try and find out what and try again.

This game is Pandemic + Eldritch Horror + All kinds of quality issues.

The quality issues. Everything about this game is low quality from the miniatures, to the cards, to the rulebook. As someone who doesn't know a ton about miniatures, even I can see that these are much lower quality than any FFG game and most modern board games in general. The level of detail is low and they just feel cheap.

My cards have various markings on the backs, from blatant white streaks to lighter scratches that can only be seen in certain lighting. The good news is that so many cards have this problem that you won't be able to tell which card is coming up unless you learn each card's unique damage pattern.

The rulebook isn't quite as bad as, say, a Portal Games rulebook, but it's pretty bad. If you read the BGG forums you'll see that there are several important rules that just aren't in the rulebook. It's not that they're poorly explained or buried, they're just not in the book. The layout of the rulebook is also really amateurish. For example, the main scenario of the game is Scenario 2. That's right, the first scenario to play and the one that is the "standard" mode of the game is called Scenario 2.

To setup the game, you have to refer to the a setup guide at the front of the rulebook, flip to scenario setup in the back of the rulebook, and then some cards will have additional setup information. I've learned hundreds of games, and the setup and learning of this game took more work than almost any other, despite it being a fairly simple game at its core.

There are also various printing issues with the cards, where information on the back doesn't match up with the front (on the adventure cards) and a lot of inconsistent wording.

The gameplay. A lot of the mechanics feel archaic by modern standards such as spending valuable actions to discover a token and flipping it over to see that you've found "nothing." The balance of a lot of the cards doesn't seem to be very well developed, where some cards from the same deck will give you an awesome ability and some might just let you draw 2 cards from a different deck. There are also quite a few duplicates in the decks, which is anticlimactic when you go on an adventure and just end up with a second backpack or third.

With all of that said, the game can be fun. You move around the board and roll dice to fight enemies. Fighting the bosses is really cooperative because you have to coordinate and plan out your turns to be able to take them down. There's potential for fun, but the designer and publisher have done everything in their power to keep the players from experiencing any of it.

The player count may also be an issue. My initial game where I was able to squeeze some fun out of the game was with four players. At that player count you can go off and complete your missions, go on adventures, and do various tasks while the other players keep the enemies from spreading too much. The four of us trying to organize how to team up and fight the bosses was one of the most fun aspects.

I recently played a partial two player game where all of that fun stuff was gone. Because of the amount of enemies popping up all over the place, we had to spend entire turns just moving and attacking enemies. There was no time to work on our own missions or the adventures on the board. Fighting the bosses seems like it would be a lot harder because, unless I missed it in the rulebook, the bosses don't scale by player count. So two players would have to be able to dish out as much damage as four players. I say this was a "partial" play because we basically said "this sucks" after a few turns and packed it back up.

It would be nice if the game had been subjected to some form of quality control, and more importantly a real publisher who could polish it up into a really great production. From what I've seen, quality control and customer service are almost non-existent at 8th Summit so I won't be buying anything from them in the future.

So overall it's just bad, despite having some potential. Awful rulebook, no quality control, outdated design choices, poor player count scaling. 8th Summit is actively bad for the board game hobby.

There was a lot going on here. This game took forever and at one point I thought we were dead and then it went on another hour. Great theme and production. It's like pandemic and I prefer this over that if it wasn't for how slowly it takes to kill the bosses and just the time overall.

This game is HUGE.
Tons of minis, tokens, boards and decks, but man, is the set up time worth it.
As usual, Richard Launius puts the theme front and center, and the game immerses you quickly into its post-apocolyptic universe. It's full of tension and decision points that drive the cooperative play while almost eliminating the alpha player problem that many co-ops face.
The design is clearly built on Defenders of the Realm, but it's improved on that already great game exponentially. Many of the changes are subtle and simple, but add real gameplay improvements. For example, there are "gambling" locations on the map that let you take a gamble action. Thematic for sure,  but giving players another way to improve their hands in preparation for big boss battles opens the game up tremendously. And this is just one of many additions to Richard's tried and true design. If you have not played Defenders of the Realm, it may take some time to wrap your head around this one. But it's worth every second you spend to learn this game. The mechanical questions melt away quickly, and what you're left with is a game that creates a different (usually amazing) story for you and your friends every time. Many will have bad endings, but when that good ending does come, there simply aren't many better moments in gaming.

This is a must own game that will see tons of action in my group.

Essentially Pandemic + Mad Max + a little bit of Arkham Horror. Sounds awesome right?

Well it is, but unfortunately it also feels underdeveloped and has several glaring flaws. While the thematic realization is absolutely spot on, production quality is inconsistent, especially for an expensive kickstarter game. The board looks great, but the minis (aside from the nice looking faction leaders) remind me of cheap plastic toy soldiers for kids. The art is mostly good but the graphic design is atrocious and overly busy, with clip art like icons and unfitting fonts that reek of placeholder.

The worst part however is the rulebook. Its structuring doesn't make any sense and it contains many actual mistakes.

This is the kind of game that really needs a 2nd edition.

I did not KS this.  I bought it through an FLGS.  I knew going into it that the minis are total crap, and they are (when compared to CMoN minis which I consider a good standard within the industry for one-piece figures).  I do like the theme more than DotR so if you're a DotR fan and like post-apocalypse themes, you'll probably like this one.

I feel like there are much better games on the market that does what this does in far less setup, playtime, or fidliness. If you've played Defenders of the Realm, this just feels like more of the same (tons of cards, etc). For me, Defenders didn't really feel like a great iteration on Pandemic (Pandemic: Legacy knocked that out of the park) and this feels even farther away from something I typically enjoy.

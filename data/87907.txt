Incredible game, my best 18xx 'till now, the dragons buying parts of the corporations on the stock phase is a very good way to protect our corporation from the other players and injecting money before the players buying the parts for low prices. The mines are very interesting too.

First time playing an 18XX game. Pretty good game about company building (more than a train game) and earning profits. 

The train routes are basically how your company earns money and decides to pay out. 

Feel a bit like Imperial. 

Overall enjoyable business game with a train theme.

2/3/17: Interesting, but I have no idea how to play this well.

The dragon mechanic should make this good for 2 players.  On the other hand it pours a lot of money into the companies.  Loans are available, and between the loans and the dragons, it makes me wonder if you need to be much more aggressive in launching companies. 

Route building is a little weird.  You don't pay for laying track over rivers and through ridges, but you have to pay the distance costs when placing tokens.  

When you token a city, you get the traffic for the city plus and any dits in between the starting town and the city just tokened.  Revenue is based on accumulated traffic gathered by a company.  This reduces the route calculation requirements, but is not necessarily intuitive if you are used to other 18xx.

As you go through the phases, the cities get extra spots for tokens so there are spots to develop new routes.  It's less tight than I would have imagined.

Not certain how much variability there will be in repeat plays. It seems that some routes are more predictable and will be the same.

Some downsides.  
* This is a much bigger box than I'm used to for 18xx style games.
* I had some trouble with the colors, The brown and purple look similar in low yellow light.  And the black charter uses purple tokens.  
* Each player gets two maritime companies, and the payout is the same.  This leads to everyone's start being very similar.
* When calculating the costs for tokens, the costs are based on the hex edges.  In theory you should be able to look down from the top to see what the edge is, but in reality we found that we had to move the tiles each time.

reasonably quick, but all in all not a game I want to come back to after 2 plays.

the new rules are interesting, but the game doesn't seem developed enough to take advantage of them.

dragons+incremental capitalisation add a lot of fiddly and practicaly nothing of decision making over full capitalisation.

traffic system makes the game VERY flat, as companies started mid-game and forward are sure to be very weak until end of game. dumping a company is a no-option as there's no way to recover given away traffic.

what's left is playing with the absorption rules, but somehow it often turns out to be not worth the hassle - again, as if it wasn't developed enough to make this whole aspect of the game take more part in the strategy.


add to that color hue issues (orange shares are almost yellow, brown and black too similar, black exchanged for purple) and I am just not impressed overall.


(no issues with the coryo look itself, wish perhaps there was less gray and more actual color in the shares)

Although the rulechanges seemed promising, this variant was just one step too heavy for me. The complete changed version of riding isn't bad, the dragons are also well thought, but I couldn't follow always. So I prefer the more basic 18XX in the range of 1830

Beautifully produced, this 18xx title offers some interesting changes to the system that will make you rethink your approach. Playable with 2, surprisingly.

I love 18XX games, on the downside it's too long as every 18XX, that makes the game difficult to get to the table because we are busy men.

On the other side 1865 Sardinia has some interesting aspects as traffic cubes, that simplifies a lot the track of train routes to calculate company earnings.

It looks like the "meh" aspect of this game is the absorbing companies, although we never use it, we were reluctant because it gives a lot of freedom to a player with two companies to kill one for making the other highly profitable.

RATING: 9.2
After a 2nd game, this is a great 18XX.

It includes many innovative aspects that improve the game experience:
- The traffic chits system.
- The token station cost.
- The Dragons investments,perfect for 2 players.
- The absortion mechanic.
- The conversion from minor to major.

And beside, except for the box, the components are even beautiful! :)

Highly recommended.

Some different ways of approaching the 'norms' of 18XX make it an interesting change from more standard fare.  It's biggest problem is that it is labelled as being for no more than 4 players.

RATING: N/A
First game with experienced players: I got trapped on Corsica and couldn't merge with my mainland company (due to all stations being blocked). Without being able to do an acquisition, I was out of it the whole game. I also didn't get dragon investment coming in till very late game. The acquisitions and the dragon investment are both rich get richer mechanics for the companies involved. The game also makes it pretty much impossible to go bankrupt so I was sat unable to do anything for the later two-thirds of the game. Not fun, especially in such a long game. I think further games are likely to be more enjoyable.

played twice with 4ppl and, while I'm a fan of 18xx games, this one failed to meet my taste, the stock round is cold, shares do not drop, the dragoon mechanic is a bit no-sense and confusing, just a way to send money to the company and the cubes, well let them to Steam (that is a great game) and not to 18xx games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
When reading the rules, I thought the Dragons would be a great innovation.  But in play, the path forward started to feel pretty scripted. It was way too easy to get money into the companies. In the end, I think as an 18xx title this one turns out to be on the dull side. 

I only had one playing, but we couldn't really interest the group in pulling this one back out when there are other better received 18xx games out there. I ended up selling my copy, although I'd be willing to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After two plays, although I like the game, I think is not a good introduction to the system, not only because of the traffic system, but because the mergers and the mayor/minor conversion are difficult decisions IMHO.

Works well with 2/3 players.

This is an innovative game with a number of interesting features.  It certainly does eliminate the route-tracing every turn.  However, it seemed to require doing odd things that didn't feel right to me in an 18xx game.

Our first play took 3 hours 45 minutes with 3 players.

Sardinia pertenece a los 18xx aunque realmente es una variante, tiene muchas cosas similares pero también un par de particularidades.
Por un lado aunque está particularidades dan cromo al juego, también le hacen farragoso y con un alto nivel de mantenimiento. El resultado es que como 18xx es un juego muy interesante, pero como juego de mesa es muy largo, con un alto nivel de mantenimiento. 
Como 18xx los Dragones (inversores extranjeros) le dan un punto interesante, pero el tema de la capacidad ferroviaria no la llegó a disfrutar, aunque simplifica el juego en esa parte, se pierde una gran parte de la táctica y estrategia en la creación de rutas para optimizar tus trenes, una parte que para mi resulta muy divertida.
Paradójicamente Sardinia reduce y simplifica una parte del mantenimiento, pero las minas, la conversión y adquisición de compañías y los dragones le hacen más largo de lo que debiera.
Nota; las reglas son de lo mejor que he visto en estos juegos.

RATING: 7
Traffic/capacity mechanism is a good one and one I'd like to see tried in more 18xx systems.  Track laying is somewhat formulaic, resulting in a similar map development each game.  Dragons and acquisitions are two tools that are really interesting.  I like the simplicity of acquisitions, the feel is consistent with the simplicity of the traffic system.  Dragons are a bit too easy to manipulate, but using them to catch opponents off guard can be a powerful tool.  Overall, interesting enough to warrant further play.

RATING: 2
There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

Another interesting take on 18xx.  This one has concepts of outside buyers putting pressure on the markets, and a limited radius on train operations.  Very intriguing.

I’ve recently acquired a copy of 1865 Sardinia using their gorgeous offer on the website. I’ve played it just once with a couple of newbies and I’ve found the game really interesting and challenging. The manufacturing is pretty good and the map is fascinating. The system is very gentle and each player despite the fact of being more or less inexpert succeeded in making his play. I won but the outcome was uncertain till the last operating round and the adsorbition rules proved to be an effective strategy toward the winning. I still have to play but my opinion is that the game is quite above the standard

RATING: 9
1865 was my first experience with an 18xx title, and I immediately was captivated by the system. I have this rated highly (9) for now, as I don't yet have enough context to know if it's a remarkable game in the series or merely run-of-the-mill. Still, I would gladly play it again if given the opportunity.

I will say that the Dragons (foreign investors) and traffic cube system for calculating revenues seemed fresh based on my general understanding of how more traditional 18xx titles function. I have since played 1889, and that impression was borne out.

RATING: 6
Our first game stalled a bit and took slightly over six hours, including rules explanation. With better play, it should be faster.

The game does many things unlike other games, and those are in general good ideas. The dragons and absorptions are fun, and the traffic system is great. Having free tile lays, but sometimes very, very expensive tokening is odd, but works, except counting the price of the tokens on a crowded board is not fun.

All in all a good and unusual 18xx game, where there's plenty of play right until the very end, the end game doesn't quite dry up like in many other games.

Indifferent.

RATING: 5.5
Gioco stancante e pensare che è pensato per essere una versione short dei 18XX. Si rifà al celebre 1830 ma con una tendenza 'buonista' che fa si che le compagnie che si svalutino molto poco. Il tutto tende ad allungare troppo la partita che, nella parte finale, si trascina senza permettere tra l'altro rimonte improvvise. Da rivedere con qualche house rules, ma se vi piace 1830 giocate a quello.

I like the innovations added here, and it is a good game, but the new mechanics considered as a whole don't add up to a top 18xx for me.

The traffic system simplifies the determination of the company revenues, but the game adds a lot of extra mechanics, so the game takes a lot longer than anticipated.

The decisions when to convert a minor to a major company and when to absorb companies are crucial.

1865 includes several new features such as maritime companies, mines, traffic cubes, dragons and absorption + state loans. Compared to many other titles the end game was also "intense" and not only tiny improvements to your runs and calculation on spreadsheet. However it seems that every players are repeating the same cycle later in the game as in order to get a better/permanent train for your "main" company (which has big amount of traffic) you'll start another company, buy a train for it next OR and absorb it to your main company during second OR. Downtime increases as every player is doing the same and the game does not move forward smoothly and it's not fun anymore. Have to play more to see if there are other ways to play.

Make sure that your first company will get a mine or two right from the start! I lost a three player game already during my first turn. I had PD and wanted to try something else and ended up to start a wrong company at WRONG par price. I was left behind from the beginning without any real chances during the whole game :(


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The game adds a lot of new concept on a classic 18XX formula. The dragons or absorptions are new interesting rules add on. The original traffic system main goal is reached: simplicity. 

The mechanics grants to play until the endgame with a good degree of unpredictability on the winner and very few chance to going bankrupt.

Good and balanced game for three player could also be a remarkable point.

The graphic and the overall look appears fine, with an attention to historical details like the money design.

The only complains, if I may say so, are on the external box somewhat huge and some color nuance difference between tokens, share and private companies cards but we can forgive them when we got playing.

My first 18XX game. I've no idea where it fits in the spectrum of good/bad/indifferent 18XX games, but I enjoyed playing it, partly because all four players were learning the system together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A really interesting take on the 18xx system - the traffic system makes running trains much easier, the variable cost (invariably high !) of placing stations can be challenging to manage, but rewarding in terms of traffic generation. 

The external investement of the 'dragons' can also be a very effective way of getting quick investement into promising companies.

Lots of interesting little challenges to meet within the game as well - such as the balance of the train roster and the need to connect directly to certain locations to convert from minor to major. All in all an interesting, well balanced, challenging game.

RATING: 8
Very nice, I especially like the fact that you do not have to count routes each turn. 

Dragons require a bit of pre-thought to correctly utilize.

RATING: 4
All the reserved tiles and the fact that you don't have to trace actual routes for your trains removes a lot of the interest one normally finds in 18xx games. You're pretty much left with the financial aspect. Unfortunately I didn't find that part very interesting, either. The Dragons are not that hard to manipulate and it is not at all clear that mergers are actually worthwhile in many cases - if you work out the math, in many cases a merger is just an elaborate way of getting a company some extra tokens. If I am running paying shares while you are just picking up tokens for later use, I will win, and so it proved in our game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Some interesting ideas, trying to reduce the tedium of late-game 18xx by eliminating route counting.  But it removes much of the interest around which trains to buy, even more than Poseidon, which is much shorter.  The merger mechanism is very interesting, though.

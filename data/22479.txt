I only have the Hellboy/BPRD set that works with both HorrorClix and HeroClix. It's still in the box, since I don't actually have enough stuff to play the game or know anyone to play against. Someday I'd like to get either the base set or buy a big lot of figures on eBay so I can actually try it out.

This is a great game. The addition of plot twist cards and the online scenarios are fantastic. PLUS no bits are overly powerfull and multiple strategies can be employed. A real step above in fun factor over Heroclix. The "cards" though cumbersome bc they can be lost or destroyed make it much easier to play a more complex clix game. Thumbs up.

PLUS there is a great spread of characters. The robots and sci-fi additions from the lab are great (aliens vs predator!!). Hopefully more movies will have product placement like screamers, starship troopers, nightmare before christmas, Terminator, or even Star Wars.

I own many many many clix minis but have never played a clix game.  I use them for heroscape custom units and was very excited about heroclix for that purpose. Then I bought a Great Cthulhu who may just be too big for heroscape, and got a few demo kits (talking to the reps that happen to be in staying in your hotel pays).  I'm very excited about the upcoming Aliens and Predators and the Aliens sculpts look great.  I'm listing this as owned (vs. all the other clix games) because I fully intend to keep some minis on their bases and play this one.

All three Alien Versus Predator sets: Queen, Aliens, Predators. No other figures so far, although I may get another box set for a different map. For extra AVP fun in the pyramid level, use the Mage Knight Dungeons Trap Tokens found in a file on the MKD page on BGG. They won't give XP but they will give you more obstacles and make the Hunt even more challenging.

Downgraded a point for collectibility, but I still like it. (And I ran local tournaments, if you think that colors my opinion one way or the other.) Takes the standard skirmish model of Clix, then adds little mobile victory points/power sources (a.k.a. Victims) to give an objective beyond straight fighting. Add in Plot Twists for extra flavor (and mini-scenarios, in the case of sub-plots), and everything just works nicely together. There are a few weaknesses (e.g. I think flying is somewhat overpowered, since so many of these slashers lack ranged attacks), but nothing that breaks the game.

Absolutely fantastic game. A vast improvment over Heroclix in every way. I can't recommend this enough. 
Each monster has it's own powers card which makes it easier to learn than HC and it means that monsters can be unique as opposed to clones of one another (a common Heroclix issue). For once, Wizkids have themselves an excellent game and I see it going far.

Update: Been playing this weekly since the day it was released, and it still has not got boring or dull. I can't speak of any other miniatures game that has had that effect with me.

As a horror fan this Clix game was right up my alley. Vast majority of figures were great looking. Loved how a lot of the mechanics worked (He's not really dead! Look out!), the plot twists, and hunting down jocks and cheerleaders.
Could results in some weird combinations of creatures on teams. Personally I made a few thematic teams with the figures I have so we can play from time to time.

RATING: 7
Essentially the same game as HeroClix, with slight rules modifications, mostly in the form of toned-down powers and victim tokens that are worth bonus points.  Actually, I can't help but wonder why WizKids didn't go through the trouble to make the two Clix systems compatible, as doing so would have made HorrorClix a must-purchase for fans of traditional HeroClix.

If you like miniatures and horror flicks, chances are high that you'll love HorrorClix.  The sculpts are *at least* as good as has been seen in HeroClix.  Although, you must wonder why shambling zombies often cost just as much points-wise as vampires.

Obviously, about the same as Heroclix.  The new rules do little to change the game flow and feel.  Still, a fun theme, and an ok game for an evening of light fun.  The collector aspect stinks.  In reality, all you need is a few boosters to add variety to the game - then stop buying them. I feel the potential for awesome miniatures was huge, but the ones produced were disappointing, especially ones from "Freak Show."

Has a few more bells and whistles than Heroclix, though the systems are close enough that it's not difficult to learn or teach. Some of the new mechanics are nice additions (like monsters that transform and having victims to stalk instead of just attacking your opponent) but I found this game to be SO much more collection-dependent than even Heroclix (and my distribution of figures was so poor) that I'm giving it lowered marks.

RATING: 7
I have the Base Starter Set, the Freddy vs. Jason Set, the Hellboy & The BPRD Set, and a few random singles.  This is more than enough to play a decent sized game, but I still find myself wanting more to play around with due to each monster/character having so much personality (WARNING: high collectibility factor).

The game is pretty cool, following a monster battle / monsters chasing victims theme.  The initial part of the game revolves around slaying/saving victims, as having saved/slayed victims (called being blooded) allows your monster to use certain abilities that make them immensly more powerful. This is a really cool mechanic for a horror themed game: coupled with the powers that monsters have, and how these powers get "activated" (usually by taking damage or slaying/saving victims) the system works really well and gives each monster a ton of character (must... resist... urge... to... buy... more...).  

There is a good deal of luck, and a few bad rolls in a row can be devastating. Mitigating for these situations using good tactics is a must. 

I really hope that [url=http://www.necaonline.com/]NECA[/url] (the new owners of the game) will put some money into this as they own the rights to a lot of horror movies and TV shows...

I would [b]love[/b] to see a Buffy/Angel set.

I have had some great experiences with this game. The mechanics might not be that interesting, but the miniatures and the universe are very immersive - especially the Carnival Expnsion.

I'm truly sad this game passed away.  It did a great job of capturing the feel of horror movies and had far fewer rules and mechanical messes than heroclix.  Also the fact that many characters were kept around 100 or fewer points meant that you didn't have any 300 point teams consisting of one 280 point powerhouse and one cheap tag-a-long that played many heroclix tourney's in my area.

Just picked up the awesome Cthulu mold even after trying to swear off Wizkids. Had to chime in after reading the "jump the shark" comment. I played two demos of this game and have to say, I'm not much of a fan of hero clix. Too   fidely for me (leads to way too many arguments), but this one had some fun boardgame elements. Instead of team destruction (aka hero clix) this one has phases of attacking inocents that are running all over the board , and than destroying each other. I think if Wizkids gets the licenses its going for this one has the potential to blow hero clix out of the water.

RATING: 5
The original thematic idea is nice but the execution does not live up to the expectations. There are just too many gameplay, production and support, and set composition issues.

The actual randomized HorrorClix miniatures aren't that interesting, and the fact that there are three copies of each figure in a set make them even less appealing. Luckily, the Action Packs are something completely different. Now, if they just could come up with a decent Buffy pack...

The cardboard bits are not of eurogame quality but at least they are a lot sturdier than in WotC's games. The character cards are smaller than MtG size but luckily they just fit in Dragon Shield Minis. The maps are printed on one side only, and very little effort has been put on artwork or terrain elements. The maps aren't folded properly either (except for the Alien Queen map), so they are a complete mess, and virtually impossible to get to lay flat on the table. So do not try to play this without a plexiglass sheet.

The Clix dial is a nice idea but not very user-friendly, meaning there's a separate tool for turning the dials. And the tool does not really help that much. They really should have done it like they did with the Alien Queen's Egg Base. Now those dials are sturdy and work really nicely. With a largish army, it is quite difficult to keep track of your special powers, since each color code means lots of different special powers.

The rulebook is not very easy to grab: There are lots of ambiguities and implicit declarations, and the glossary isn't very helpful since it's missing the most important parts on many of the definitions. Even when you finally manage to get some sense of it all, you still have to read the FAQ and errata (which is really long) carefully. It's a lot of work for a game this simple. Rating may rise to six if I ever get a good hang of the rules and find a really good scenario.

Hellboy pack - How can anyone afford to publish a total quality control disaster like this? There are seven miniatures in the pack, two of which have misprinted cards. This I could still live with, but four of the dials are misprinted as well! And on top of that, one figure has a flying base, even though it's not a flying unit. Luckily, it is possible to remove that excess piece of plastic using some creative violence, and after that it's easy to just glue the miniature back to the dial. The backs of the victim counters are not similar to the counters from the base game.

Alien Queen pack - Wizkids cheapskates strike again: The Queen and her minions do not have cards at all. Instead, all their data is printed on one thin sheet of paper. The Egg Base dials work like a charm but the Queen's own dial is a complete mess again: The values are not centered in the dial window like they should be, but halfway between clicks instead. Since the value sheet is glued to the base, there's no way to repair the dial. The Alien figures aren't very impressive but the Predator figure looks and feels great. Even though the minions are not included in build totals, there should still be more minion tokens than just the six included. The rulebook is not very well structured, it takes some effort to figure out the rules correctly.

Predators pack - The miniatures do not look quite as good as the single figure in the Alien Queen pack, but they are quite okay anyway. The map is a disappointment. Two minor flaws in the theme: The Apprentice Hunter has the Martial Artist ability, which is silly, since she is just a guide, not a soldier. Also, the nuclear device has a range of d6 plus 2 only, which is just a tiny fraction of the punch the real thing is packing. OTOH, considering the scale of the maps, the real nuke would wipe out the entire map, and then some. That, while perfectly sound thematically, might be rather silly gameplaywise ;P

Aliens pack - Has moving walls but otherwise nothing special here. 

Another annoyingly cheap move from Wizkids: All three AVP sets come with the exactly same sheet of six identical scientist victims. Now this is completely ridiculous. Why would anyone need 18 identical victim tokens? What makes this even more annoying are the facts that the Predator card #010 lets the Predator player look at three face-down counters, and that the backs of the victim counters are not similar to the counters from the base game. Now what's the point of checking face-down counters if they are all similar and you already know what's under there based on the back of the counter?

Map squares are 38 mm.

If you like the clix based games, Horroclix is a great
addition. Very well sculpted minis, very thematic, and
now that it's discontinued you can pick them up cheap.
The rules can be confusing at times, but gameplay is very
unique even among the clix games. 
Excellent licenses and clever creature designs really add
to the enjoyment. Where else can you have werewolves,
leprechauns , and Cthulhu battling Jason Vorhees, Freddy
Kruger, Predators, or a demented version of "Barny the

I haven't played it so much, but I like it; scenarios are the core of the game, but as it is the game ends usually with a mega-melee in the center of the map... not very strategic at all. The problem in my opinion resides in the movement: in a skirmish game like this one, movement should be crucial to create strategic and tactical decisions.
Anyway the game is easily customizable and with a bit of creativity it can become very fun - I created some 'capture the flag'-like senarios where movement becomes more important (check the Variants forum).

Miniatures are very well done and painted - I have the entire base set plus the Alien Queen and the Freddy Vs. Jason packs.

Cool game with great collectibles. Very affordable off eBay. Get collections for less than $20. Not as good as Heroscape but much more affordable. Much more! Great horror theme. Gameplay is okay, definitely need to use strategy. Absolutely can be played with Heroclix, adjust build totals though. You'd need several Horrorclix to gang up on one Heroclix. Some great abilities too. Rules can be overbearing sometimes but I tend to overlook some specifics. Killing victims is essential to winning. Cheap and fun, easy to play with a great theme. It might work better if the clix counter was on a card and not on the figure it self that way you don't have to keep picking up the figures during play.

Picked up at Five Below. Already had the Great Cthulhu  figure and the BPRD set, so now I can use those to their full potential.

While I haven't played more than a few games, this game seems like just another variation on the overproduced Clix theme.  The fact that there are cards that define what each ability on a figure does doesn't really add too much complexity... and the theme itself just isn't all that strong.

I did not enjoy this game very much...regardless of winning by a landslide.  Perhaps with more players there would be a challenge, but with two players who play games together constantly, and who can read each other like a book, it wasn't very fun.

They had the starter sets at Five and Below. It came with a plastic gravestone, an evil looking tree, and my favorite, a man with tentacles bursting out of his straitjacket. How could I resist?

This game started my interest in clix.  It is great fun.  The monster sculpts are great.

RATING: 5
Dull play and game mechanics, although some of the figures are really nicely done and horrific.

RATING: 9
This is a great game.  It captures the atmosphere of a Horror / Suspense Movie.  It uses the Heroclix rules as a base, surpassing them with rules for using victims, minions and good old fashioned monsters and hunters instead of Super-heroes

RATING: N/A
Great addition to the Clix line, but I still find the 'Clix' a bit cluncky.

RATING: 4
I have no idea where my copy of the rules and maps are for this.  I was mainly interested in it for its horror themed miniatures (zombies mostly) for use in other games like Heroscape.

RATING: 5
i played a demo of this game.  The miniatures are nice&cool, but i wasn't blown away by the gameplay, although i like the clix-system (crimson skies ...)

I really wanted to like this game, but it very much falls short in game play!

The game sessions are very drawn out and relatively dull.  Unless you make up for it through excitment, house rules, and an addition of RPG, I think it wouldn't appeal to most people.

The game components, however, are top-notch!  I really like the unique system used in all Clix variations, but it isn't enough to save this mess.

The collection aspect is also a downfall.  Having variations of the same pieces contributes to the annoyance factor.  

This game did have a lot of potential, but it was poorly executed.  It was another attempt for Wizards of the Coast to rape people of money.

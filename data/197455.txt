The fact that I own this at all is embarassing. There is zero reason to play this sorry excuse for a party game more than once, and the rulebook doesn't even do a good job of communicating the incredibly simple rules. 
The best thing I can say about this game is that it's easy to make a decent board game with this as a starter if you wanna take the time to design one.

Set collection game which involves rolling dice to determine what you can acquire. Plays quick, which is the best compliment that I can give to it.

Simple dice rolling game to collect sets of similar cards.

Every turn at least one new card is added to one of the museums. Then you may choose to try to roll to steal from 1 museum or take a temporary die.

You succeed stealing all cards at a museum if you roll the number shown or higher on ONE die. If you are successful, all temporary dice that you rolled that turn go back to the supply. The game ends when the deck is empty.

Fun and fast, but enough strategy to be interesting. Nice balance between the randomness of dice rolls and the influence of your decisions.

RATING: 7
This is a spectacular 'ice breaker' game for game night. Simple, quick to explain, faster to pick up, and a ton of fun. Plays through in about 20 minutes, and then you're on to a more in depth game. Use this to kick your game night off the right way!

RATING: 6
A fun-enough game of set collecting via press your luck dice rolling.  Thematically, it's actually pretty neat as you see the treasures build up in the harder to roll museums and you decide whether to try and hit it now or gather a helper and hope you have a chance to hit it before the other players do.  

Art on the cards is fun to look at, especially the artifacts and paintings that have unique art.  I wish the dice were bigger, they are really small and not that satisfying to roll.  

This is a game you can play without thinking too hard about.  It's best for groups who would rather talk while playing a light game, or as an appetizer or dessert game.

Another very light pleasant dice chucker.  Isn't going to set the world on fire, but it's cute enough and for a short game at the end of the night, it's not bad.  The art is lighthearted, it might not be everyone's style since it's a bit silly.  I think it's a bit unbalanced but after only one play I am not sure.  Lots of luck, little strategy.

Why? How much do you want to push your luck versus taking another die? My first and likely only game involved one pile of cards (around 9) that everyone kept failing rolls for several times around - winner was obviously the person who won those cards. At least it is over in 10 minutes. This isn't my type of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a great push your luck game with fun artwork. It isn't much of a challenge but if you want a simple, fun and fast game that isn't too taxing then Dice Heist is a good addition to your collection. My wife especially likes it as she regularly beats me.

RATING: 7
This is a good little filler with some strategy and fun "aww, c'mon!" moments when you roll poorly or an opponent rolls well.  Like any good filler, it also has that "Let's play that one more time" quality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a favorite filler of mine. The decisions are straightforward and little thought is required to play. I'm saying this in a positive way because the game isn't trying to be something it's not. Gameplay is consistently under 10 minutes. 

I'll bring it along on road trips because of its small foot print. Double sleeved cards and small plastic baggie with dice and fit perfectly in a deck box. Boom!, good filler and traveler.

Picked it up at GenCon50 on a whim. I like dice games and I like heists. lol. Played 2 player, worked well. The art isn't the best, but there are some funny elements in some of the pieces. I can see how it could get more intense with more players. Had a good time playing (even though I rolled terribly), will get it out again. Probably not heavy rotation, though.

Video review - https://youtu.be/EmNp1j3Cd4U

Dice heist is a fun push your luck filler. Four museum cards are gradually filled with goodies. On you go your will attempt to rob a museum or get some extra help from a sidekick (pick up another dice). If you decide to rob a museum you must roll the number on the museum card or higher.  If you do you rob all the goodies, and there are some bonuses for getting sets etc... Fun quick filler.

Simple dice-rolling push-your-luck, but with a soupçon of strategy thrown in.  Fun game, if rather on the light side.

RATING: 7
A nice quick and light set-collection game using a non-Yahtzee press-your-luck-dice-mechanism and has art thievery theme. Keep it light, fast, and cutthroat or else the game will drag. Humorous alterations of world famous artworks. Easy to teach and play.

Not good 2 player.

RATING: N/A
Very light dice filler. Each turn, you either add a die to your pool, or you roll dice to try to steal art.

Looks OK, but I don't like that often you'll come away with nothing at all. And since you play through the entire deck, it seems like it would run a bit long at lower player counts.

A game that does an okay job of playing with running the odds of dice rolls, sorta set collection a la Cash and Guns meets the dice rolling nightmares of Machi Koro, Settlers, etc.

This game is basically a dime a dozen. There is absolutely nothing that stands out to me. If you don't like pushing your luck with constant dice rolls and limited real decisions, don't get this game.

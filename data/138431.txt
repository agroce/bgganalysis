Very boring, extremely fiddely and overly long dice fest with a lot of stupid, complex rules for complexity's sake. The designers seem to have collected every mechanic they found interesting in similar games and thrown them all mindlessly together into a single game. The problem is that it doesn't work. Disappointing.

1st play: Very cool XCom themed board game.  It's not exactly Xcom, but it felt a lot like that, with customizable scenarios and 3-4 types of aliens in the first few missions.  Line of sight is very important, and it's way easy to get overwhelmed.  You don't have the cover mechanic necessarily, but LOS around buildings and stuff is important.  Tons of dice rolling, guns can run out of ammo or jam.  Very cool minis.

2nd play: Decent.  I don't play many heavy Ameritrash games and I like the theme of this one a lot. We've now seen all the aliens, and the missions are very hard. The playtime is a bit long, and there are a ton of dice rolls.  Happy to continue the story, but if we move on to another campaign that's ok too.

I really wanted to like this game. The concept was great, but the execution was not. I like to feel like I at least have a chance at succeeding when playing a game, and, after the first couple missions, I was not getting that feeling anymore. Even playing the sniper with the High Impact rule, I felt like I was not making much progress defeating aliens.

I'd rather play Zombicide.

RATING: 8
A well produced cooperative sci-fi miniature game with a campaign system to boot. I like the general gameplay and promise of the game. 

Rulebook is big and seems daunting but in reality things are not that complicated. Combat system is simple enough and is using some nice looking custom dice. The Aliens have their own A.I activation cards. Each alien has his own personality. 

The campaign system looks promising but truth be told the scenarios seems to be repetitive. The game is well produced with nice looking miniatures and board pieces.

All in all an enjoyable game. One of the best in this category but still not exactly perfect.  


Συνεργατικό Sci-fi παιχνίδι με μινιατούρες, campaign σύστημα και θέμα την εισβολή εξωγήινων στη Γη. Το campaign σύστημα κάνει πάντα την διαφορά. Η δυνατότητα να δεθείς με τον χαρακτήρα σου ανεβάζοντας τον σιγά-σιγά level από αποστολή σε αποστολή είναι μεγάλο πλεονέκτημα για μένα. Παίξαμε μόνο τα πρώτα 2 σενάρια μέχρι στιγμής και η δυσκολία φαίνεται να είναι σωστή. Κερδίσαμε μεν αλλά με σχετικό ζόρι και λίγο τύχη στις κατάλληλες στιγμές. Λογικά θα δυσκολέψει παραπάνω στη συνέχεια.

Πολύ θεματικό το παιχνίδι. Το rulebook είναι καμιά 40 σελίδες αλλά στη πράξη τα πράματα είναι σχετικά απλά. Οι εξωγήινοι έχουν κάρτες με AΙ που σου λένε τι κάνουν σε κάθε περίπτωση. Το σύστημα μάχης είναι απλό όπως και το LOS. Να τονίσω βέβαια πως σου αφήνει χώρο για τακτικές αποφάσεις. Δεν είναι δηλαδή τελείως απλό όπως το Mice and Mystics (που ανέφερα παραπάνω) αλλά φυσικά δεν είναι και tactical wargame. Κάπου στη μέση είναι τα πράματα. Για παράδειγμα να αναφέρω πως υπάρχει πχ facing, friendly-fire, ammo και άλλες τέτοιες όμορφες λεπτομέρειες.

Δεν υπάρχει μεγάλη ποικιλία από χαρακτήρες και εξοπλισμό αφού φαντάζομαι όλα τα εξτρα είναι kickstarter exclusive, αλλά τουλάχιστον οι χαρακτήρες είναι πολύ διαφορετικοί μεταξύ τους οπότε ΟΚ δεν νιώθεις ότι λείπει κάτι. Στην τελική κάποια στιγμή θα βγάλουν και καμιά επέκταση για αυτούς που θέλουν μεγαλύτερη ποικιλία.

Αξιόλογο παιχνίδι με ωραίο θέμα που στο βγάζει και στο gameplay, ενώ παράλληλα δείχνει να έχει και το σωστό (για μένα) βαθμό πολυπλοκότητας και δυσκολίας.

This is a very addictive game with cool concept and excellent material in the box. It can be described as a game somewhere between Doom and Gow in term of gameplay (it has a clear filiation with those games) and fiddiness.
It has its flaws, but it sure deserves a good score for a cooperative game. Not as fiddy as Arkham or Doom, a game takes quite long (2-3 hours).

Un cooperativo excelente. La IA (basada en cartas) hace que ninguno de los jugadores tenga que hacer de "alien" y es lo suficiente coherente como para que las acciones de los enemigos no sean completamente al azar. Está muy lograda y permite a los jugadores preparar su estrategia basándose en posibles reacciones de los aliens.

El juego escala muy bien independientemente del número de jugadores. Se puede jugar como solitario (con un solo personaje) y el juego sigue siendo intenso y muy divertido.

Una vez que se han aprendido las mecánicas básicas los turnos no son demasiado largos y todos los jugadores tienen cosas que hacer o aportar a las estrategias de sus compañeros.

Scratches the same itch for killing things and leveling up that the Pathfinder card game does, and certainly the choices are more meaningful.  The AI mechanic is decent, and the various alien "species" are well-differentiated in how they play, as are the heroes.

On the other hand, it's a real dice-fest, and not all that tactically challenging, so at this point (3 solo games in) I'm still not sure it will retain my interest in the long run.

RATING: 7.6
A few plays in I am loving this game. It is completely different than my usual preferences. I don't usually love this much luck or dice rolling. However, even with all the luck, it seems like there are real decisions and strategies in this game that matter. Plus, the campaign and character progression really put this over the top for me. The only negatives for me are that the rules are a little clunky and unclear in spots (which might be due to translation issues). I've only played this solo, but it has quickly become one of my favorite big solo games.

Update: I finally got rid of this. The game was just too long (including setup time) for the amount of fun I had playing it. I also got frustrated as the campaign went on because the game forced me to play solo with 4 or 5 characters, which became a headache to track. This is still a good game, but not one I would have played often enough to justify keeping.

Initial Impression: The components are an interesting mix. I love the think, chunky cardboard components and the cardstock used in the game. For me, the minis left something to be desired, as they reminded me of dollarstore plastic kids toys. Perhaps a good paintjob could help. The gameplay is fairly fun and interesting and I feel that the campaign is really where this game will shine. The biggest flaw which immediately became apparent is that the AI becomes very predictable as you learn the movement/attack patterns on the Alien cards. Had this been randomized a bit more it may have added to the playability without adding too much overhead. Perhaps a card driven system similar to what was used in D-Day at Omaha Beach? I would probably like to experience this game again at some point to see if my impressions hold water.

The best coop campaign story driven game out there. This game really is XCOM in board game form.

Fantastic game, fantastic support. I love it!

We only need a few more skills, items and weapons to make it a clear 10.

EDIT: The addons fixed everything. Now GD is perfect. Cannot understand why games like Descent 2 or Imperial Assault are so popular and this game is not. This game is a rockstar.

The only downside is the setup time. It takes so long to get a game of GD started, especially with the expansions.

I could be talked into this game. I could. But I just didn't find it fun. In the end, I just felt like I was constantly attacking and defending and slow like syrup making my way towards the goals. Which would have been fine in a short game. But this was long and we had to look up rules frequently and it felt very very fiddly. I could see myself enjoying this as an iPad game, but I don't think I'd ever enjoy it in real life.

Also, the graphic design is bad, it's hard to tell what enemy is what, and sometimes there's two of the same enemy on board. There was one power I was using totally wrong because I couldn't see a period printed on my board, because it was so tiny, but it changed the rules of my character entirely. Crazy.

great game! very thematic. good components (although my copy came with a mini without head. "ares games" sent me a replacement. excellent customer service). 

the missions (i played through 3rd one) are defiants, and very inmersive. good choice of actions, but a high luck factor. the campaing mode is great, achieving to improve agents and weapons, and when a agent dies, it hurts... and they will die, for sure, through the campaing. 

i'm sad because i didn't get the kickstarter. 

edited: updated from 8 to 8,5. it's even better while you're playing through the campaign.

edited 2: downgraded to 7,5, when i played with friends. not too funny.

Difficulty note: I know a lot of people play with the "friendly fire" rule, which seems totally logical. But it does actually make the game a *lot* harder - some of your best weapons are area damage and aliens tend to mix it up pretty aggressively. So I think I would recommend turning that optional rule off, just to keep the difficulty rational (later scenarios already can be quite tough) and give you some room to pull in elite aliens if you are so inclined.
---
I like this one, sort of the "best of" Ravenloft/Descent genre in a playable, interesting, and well-tuned package (I hated Descent and was so-so on Ravenloft). The mix of ranged and close combat works quite well. Nice minis, and nice "level-up" system for the heroes, but you can still play it quite satisfactorily as a one-off (in fact, the campaign system is boilerplate and not terrific, so the best way to play might be to do it in campaign sequence based on results but to gear up and prep agents as if it were a one-off).

A number of people have complained about the defense dice, which some players don't like as a technique. It does add another place to hook in special powers (nice), but it can also make killing things hard and combat a bit swingy, and it also can take time. In general I think it works here, but I do recommend the optional rule which limits defense dice to 5. This feels a bit more thematic. This has been adopted as standard as of the expansions.

Tip: be careful! It's easy to get the impression that the game isn't that deadly, especially since the enemy unit count starts low and you're rolling all those defense dice all the time, but you can't just wade in. A couple unlucky activation cards and your agent can get shredded by crossfire, especially in games with a larger player-count and more open lines of sight. It can be pretty deadly. You need to be tactically clever and take your time when needed. A lot of the scenarios are not so tight no time that you can't afford to move carefully. Also, understand how doors work. This is crucial to some scenarios, particularly the difficult scenario 5.

Caveat 1: the rules are sketchy, and don't cover some stuff as clearly as they should (or in a few cases, at all). If you're a fan of this genre you should be able to figure it out, but watch out for the pathological rules-lawyers.

Caveat 2: the play time can really bloat with 4 or 5 players. Scenarios with smaller player-counts can move quite briskly, but as you add players you often add a mass of aliens to wade through. I think the playtime might increase linearly with the number of players, which isn't great. Once you get the hang of it I think it's fine even with the full compliment, but I would generally say that smaller player counts (3, maybe 4) will play better, especially as you're going up the learning curve. You'll be missing skills, but more frequent activations seems to more than compensate. Like a lot of these things, smaller player-counts seem to make it easier on the players (Pandemic and Lord of the Rings are both this way too). Several scenarios require 5 agents, which should be clearly noted as 5 agents, not necessarily 5 players :) These missions are often bloody and it's good to have an extra agent for when someone dies.

Also, the skill add at level 2 is the big deal in terms of improving your agent's and team's odds. If you're playing later scenarios with rookie agents due to KIAs, you might want to up start them at Silver level, just to give yourself a chance.

Last thing: a win in scenario 1 (fairly easy) allows you to skip scenario 2 and go right to scenario 3. This is probably not a good idea. You need the extra experience and level-ups at this point, because scenario 5 is a total killer.

Anyway, this is the first entry in this genre of co-op slugfests that I've genuinely liked quite a bit. I don't know if it'll hold up to extended play, but looking forward to seeing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
A good game that holds up pretty well.  The mechanisms are solid and play is rewarding.  The campaign element is probably the best part as the scenarios are interesting and the story rewarding long-term.

What's holding it back is the fact that its setting and identity are not fully formed.  It clings to an X-COM nostalgic angle which works somewhat, but it feels like it's still building towards something greater.  I think the expansions will be the deciding factor on this game's legacy.

I was first introduced to this game when asked to demo it for a convention in 2014.  It is a streamlined dungeon crawler in space.  I like the way upgrades are handled by building up a hexed up character sheet.  The alien movement is interesting as well in that they jump from area to area instead of by individual spaces.  The "programming" of what they do at different distances is also clever and gives unique flavor to the different types.

I primarily bought this game for solo play: it's a cooperative game and the box does say "1-5 players", so I was a bit disappointed to find that not all the missions can be played with only 1 (or even 2 or 3) Galaxy Defender character(s).  In a cooperative game if I'm playing solo I will often play 2 or maybe 3 characters, but some of the missions in Galaxy Defenders need 5 Galaxy Defender characters to play!  That's a lot for 1 player to keep track of.  I haven't played a 5 character mission yet so I'll see how that works out.

Now onto the good stuff...  This is the first game I've played with a "line-of-sight" rule for combat, so that took a bit of getting used to.  However, it feels totally thematic so it helped me enjoy the game.

If you were to think of this game as "I've got to move there to pick up that token" then it could feel dull.  Instead I immerse myself in the story behind the mission and think "OK, I've got to rescue the scientists who have some valuable information to help us" and so on.

The Aliens AI works really well.  Each Alien has different movement and attacking characteristics, so it feels really cool and varied.  

The Close Encounter deck often spells trouble for the Galaxy Defenders with more Aliens spawning leading me to have a Hudson from the Aliens film moment: "There's movement all over the place".  Aliens is one of my favourite films and Galaxy Defenders has me feeling like I'm in the Aliens film.  Which left me grinning like a kid at Christmas.  I've seen comments comparing Galaxy Defenders to XCOM and Gears of War.  I've not played either so I can't comment.  I just know it reminds me of the Aliens film and that's good enough for me!

The missions often take longer than depicted in the missions booklet, but I'm still so immersed in the gameplay that I've not been noticing the time going by!

I love the detail of the artwork on the boards.  It really helps with depicting different terrains and helps with the thematic immersion.

Each Galaxy Defender has different weapons and special abilities.  So far I've only played with 2: the Marine and the Sniper.  I'm looking forward to trying out the others, which I'll have to do in the 5 character missions anyway.
 
Some of the rules are a bit vague but I've been trying to apply what seems like a sensible rule so as to keep the game flowing.

So far I'm having a blast with this game.  I haven't finished the campaign yet, but there's more missions to download on the Galaxy Defenders website in addition to the 12 that come in the base game.  So hopefully I'll be playing and enjoying this game for a good while yet.

Great theme that is executed well but I find there's too much to track in this game, that's why I gave it a low ranking. It's games like these I miss bonuses or hindrances and that makes me feel as though I didn't win or loose properly. Not a great feeling for me. To be honest, I don't know if I ever played an "honest" game, I'm sure I missed something here and there in every game. Again, the reason for a lower rank.

A very solid experience, streamlined gameplay, little to no downtime. What more can I say: Almost perfect. Replayability might be a little drawback -- there certainly is a random element in the card draws (especially close encounter cards) and the dice, which allows for some variance between plays. However, this doesn't look overly strong to me, so once you work out a basic strategy for a given mission, I'm not sure whether playing that mission will remain interesting.

What with 12 missions to the base game, and 12 to come with the expansions, plus any goodies the fanbase might care to create, this should be a manageable problem, on the other hand :)

OK, this is take 2 of my attempt to comment on this game.  I was "meh" after my first couple games, but after my last session with my wife, I think "get it" now.  There really is some interesting tactical depth here, along with a lot of theme and fun.  I don't love that the AI requires you to do some strategizing against yourself.  However, I came to terms with that by rolling a die to choose between options if the best course for the aliens is not obvious.  I think you need to be prepared to fudge things to keep the game moving along.  This would not be a good game for someone who needs for the rules to strictly dictate the enemy AI.

So as of now, I am really enjoying it and regretting less than ever letting my Space Hulk go.

On a side note though, this game is a serious offender when it comes to tempting people with Kickstarter exclusives.  Here they don't really even integrate with the game very well, they just give you some borderline i.p.-infringing models to play with if you can figure out how.

UPDATE Jan 2016. 4 missions in, and the game is proving to be super fun.  I attribute this to the excellent mission design. The game is very well balanced and has given us. A challenging, cinematic experience every time so far.  You really do need to be easy going about the alien AI though.  Just roll a die to decide if multiple options are possible.  
Mission 5 was loooong, but it was interesting in that time is one your side for once in this one.  You need to stall more than anything and avoid the big bads that show up near the end, because you are no way equipped to handle them! 

UPDATE March 2016
We finished the first campaign!  We did not play the bonus mission, because it looked anticlimactic.  Overall, I'd say the campaign was just the right length and the missions had nice pacing.  My wife and I really enjoyed going through this as a co-op, but I think that also limits the replayability.  However, we got 12 awesome plays out of this, and that's so much more than many other games!  We are also eager to move forward into the expansion campaigns.

Decided I wanted to give a tactical campaign based game a spin, and picked this up for a good price at MM.

The AI is good, if you position poorly, you are suitably punished. I'm giving this one a7 for now, I'll revisit as I get deeper into the campaign.  

The fact that I want to keep going is a good sign.

It's been a while since I've played this, but basically it it was extremely hard and I didn't like dice combat. I kind of knew I wouldn't like it, because it has a number of qualities that I generally dislike in board games:

-KS exclusives/add-ons that I won't ever get
-Lots of plastic miniatures (I like cardboard standees or pawns... unless it's painted mini's)
-Scenario-based

[u]The Good[/u]: 1) An intriguing sci-fi toolkit, in board game form. 2) Plays excellent solo. 3) Two promising Expansions on the horizon that look to add much to the equation.

[u]The Bad[/u]: 1) Replayability suffers due to a lack of random factors within a given mission. 2) Less tactical decision-making than I would have liked; yet still bogged down by a heavy ruleset - I feel like the direction they went with the map layout (areas, etc), however innovative, is to blame for this. Would have loved to have seen ways to take Cover, for example, but the map layouts prevent this.

[u]The Bottomline[/u]: Feels like this game is still in its infancy, and might not be truly realized until the looming Expansions hit. I can recommend this to solo gamers though, and depending on what the expansions bring to the table, the end product could be a [I]very[/I] solid sci-fi squad-based board game.

It was fun. Definitely too long for the choices you are making, and the rules are fairly unclear when it comes to alien activation, but I enjoyed kicking butt with my character and building her skills.

Update - Playing it solo, the game feels way better. The rules were clearer my second try, and playing multiple characters makes it feel much more tactical. Now I'm a big fan.

This really fell flat for me (solo play). It's a mix of a few things. Gameplay just isn't that fun. 

It feels like there are many situations where, through no fault of your own, you get stuck in an un-survivable situation for one or two characters. Which may be thematic, but does not make me want to play more. The dice system is a little too much checking back and forth for special abilities. 

And finally, I was hoping for some continuity in the characters. But the skills and tactics you get to customize your character are so limited, and death so common, that you don't get attached to the characters at all.

As a HUGE fan of both the original and rebooted XCom PC games, this is the closest thing in cardboard and plastic to the tactical ground missions on screen.  Only the lack of a strategic element knocks this down half a point.  Otherwise, an absolute must for any XCom fan!

It's cooperative and it's skirmish, so it has to be compared with my favorite game of this genre: Zombicide. Granted, the first mission does not include the search action, but then still, I found Z. to be quicker and more fun. I liked the modular player board but did not like for example that leveling up was not determined by your kills but by a regular dice roll. This felt not thematic. Otherwise OK game.Further plays may change my initial rating.

The dude at drivethru reviews called it Xcom Ravenloft, plus after watching Tragic's playthrough I was totally sold.
The game delivers as predicted/hoped. Very very happy with this one. Leveling up is fun and varied, through many weapons, devices, and skills, all upgradable. Being able to play campaigns that gives great narrative and multi-path scenario outcomes. All 5 agents, and even AI alien turns, are fun and extremely tactical to play. All have reasonably balanced, positive and negative skills and stats, each with interesting and specific class traits. 
Small niggles: large minis on small very busy boards can feel a bit weird. And those boards, at least in my case,  do warp a little. Finally upkeep is somewhat involved. But like I say, these are minor issues. Overall its hard to find anything major to fault. 
Now rating among the higher echelons of the 'one of my type of games' games. Truly as near as you can get to the tactical portion of X-Com, while keeping rules light and playtime respectable. Fantastic. 

I don't believe for a minute that that board/tablet hybrid, frantic scrabble around, rub your tummy and pat your head in 20 seconds type abomination coming from FFG, purporting to be X-Com the game. Will be, in the slightest! (i was right!)

Own everything. The great quality mini's, are now all painted to do them true justice. Top Notch Ares.

Reminds me of X-COM: UFO DEFENSE.  Nice game components, and a clean mechanics.  The campaign game is good.

Games can drag/be too long, and there is something which doesn't jive with the dice combat system.  Too often 4 or 5 hits are scored, only to be ALL blocked by the defense, which has a 30% chance per die.  If this is bad luck, it can really scrap what was, up to that point, a good game.

Unfortunately, this game will not hit the table as often as it should as one member of my game group finds it too long...  time to find new players  ;)

I absolutely loved X-Com: Enemy Unknown on the Xbox 360.  It was my favorite game of 2012.  Galaxy Defenders is basically that game in a box.  There are definitely some warts, though.  I like the idea of a separate rulebook and campaign/mission book, but why are there rules in the campaign/mission book that AREN'T in the main rulebook?  And the game is pretty tough, too.  The maps can be a little hard to distinguish where you can go and what blocks line-of-sight.  The miniatures are awesome, though.  I kickstarted it and was able to get all of the exclusive characters and they are very cool.  My wife really didn't like the game after playing it, though.  She thought it was overly complicated and she's pre-disposed to dislike games with a hex map.  In her mind, those two things are linked.  Hex maps are generally used by wargamers who generally have rule books thicker than the phone book.  She also didn't feel like it was "fun".  I agree that it wasn't as fun as I was antipating, but I think that is about the learning curve.  We did have to check the rule book A LOT (which was made more difficult when rules were split between two books); I think more plays would make it much smoother.  Unfortunately, we have too many other good games right now that we'd rather play when we have the time.

Really enjoy this sci-fi tactical combat game!  I can't give it a 10, because it is quite fiddly, takes a while to setup with the deck construction (more than M44), and takes about 3 plays to get the hang of it.  The rules aren't hard, but there are many.

I find the tactics very interesting with good choices that can greatly affect the outcome.  The components are great.  The missions are well designed with interesting variety that tweak the base rules.  

Caveat: It's better to play with the designer's 'High Impact' rule, which means defenders can roll no more than 5 defense dice.  That way when you get an awesome 6+ hit roll, you're going to see the damage you expect.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (June 2014)

WOW, initial impressions are very positive. I love this kind of game (tactical miniatures) and it has my favorite theme to boot (Sci-Fi Invasions). I felt like I was playing X-COM The Boardgame.

I have only played once but I would love to play the campaign. So far I felt the game was VERY difficult. I’m not sure if this was because I was a newbie but we got crushed.

The components are gorgeous, the minis very well done an I love the additional characters (Robocop, Predator etc) from the KS edition. 

So far, my only issue is the combat system. I don’t like that the defender throws as many dice as potential hits. Two times I managed to get 6 hits and the defender only got one wound in the first attack and the second one was totally neutralized. That doesn´t feels right. This is very different from every miniature games I have played but it feels anti-thematic that the “shield factor” can grow in proportion to the attack. After more plays I will see if this is really an issue for me or not. At least, this way the combats are pretty straightforward and quickly.

The playtime is on the longer side and this can be an issue if you get eliminated early on.

Bottom line, I want to play again soon. I liked a lot what I saw but I need to play again to form a better opinion.

This is a really fun cooperative dungeon crawl with a sci fi theme. I had some initial misgivings about the combat system. The fact that you can roll 5 or 6 hits and then have the target soak all (or even just most) of them without too much difficulty, can be disheartening. Over the course of multiple plays, though, I've grown to not mind it so much. The rest of the game is a lot of fun, and the campaign play is great.

Update: 10 plays in, and I have to bump my rating up to an 8 (from a 7.5). The game isn't perfect, and I even think I like the game play from some other games better. But the campaign is so compelling, that I just always want to play the next mission.

RATING: 6
GD is a cooperative game in which the heroes are trying to meet mission objectives against an endless onslaught of powerful aliens. The unique element to this one is how the alien A.I. dictates alien movement and actions. Every alien has a card that specifies what it will do when activated, driven by the distance of the alien from the closest hero. If adjacent, alien does X. If 1 area away, alien does Y. If 2 areas away, alien does Z... and so on. This gives players a pretty good idea of what might happen and can therefore end their actions in order to intentionally trigger certain behaviors in the aliens. This adds a tactical flavor that feels fairly unique to this system. It keeps from being entirely predictable by changing up (through activation draws) which aliens activate after each player action. So one hero might be shooting an alien group full of holes, but a different group of aliens keeps activating, ripping a different hero to shreds. With an alien activation between EVERY hero activation, sometimes a lot can happen around a hero before they get a chance to react.

The game also has a promising-looking campaign mode, but otherwise is pretty standard to the genre. Heroes have skills and weapons that they can improve and single use devices that can be replaced as more aliens are killed. It is a bit strange in the way that new equipment magically appears in a hero's hands when it arrives. The game is driven much more by mechanics than realism - and that might be to the game's credit. Ultimately, even though this game really has fewer modifiers than many in the genre, I still found it a bit much and a clearer rule book would have helped. I like these games more in theory than reality, which is why I keep trying them out. Claustrophobia is just about the only tactical combat minis game where I was not overwhelmed with modifiers and could just enjoy playing. The weird thing is that this kind of thing bothers me less in hex-and-counter war games because there tends to be more strategy involved. But for a primarily tactical game, my patience with modifiers seems to be far, far less.

A mishmash of various squad based games like Doom and Space Hulk. The game works and plays quickly, but some parts feel a bit strange (like aliens not activating for several turns or the high percentage of misses on dice). Of minor note is that the text on the cards are a bit wordy and the font hard to read.

Once you get past that, this game is quite fun. Its not too overwhelming for new players, the components are great and the theme of sci-fi movie parodies is immensely amusing.

Gears has no character advancement in any form which has me leaning to Galaxy Defenders as of late. On the other hand, I think Gears is a better game for solo play, even if you have to manage multiple hands. I've personally found it harder to manage two or three characters solo in Galaxy Defenders.

Galaxy Defenders - The Earth Strikes Back Kickstarter, Galaxy pledge

After playing 3 missions solo (controlling 5 agents), here are my first impressions:
 The miniatures in this game are awesome. Very sturdy and functional, but pretty too. I'm not a huge fan of the Arachnoid (it looks more silly than dangerous), but all in all, very well done. All other components are top notch too. The boards are a bit warped, but nothing a weekend under a few heavy books can't handle.
On to the gameplay: This game is X-COM. Forget about FFG's 'official' X-COM game, that's a management game. GD however is a very good simulator for X-COMs tactical combat. I really like it, but there are some complaints. Difficulty fluctuates wildly, and the dice can be brutal. It's not a lot of fun when you manage to roll 7 hits with the Sniper, only to have the alien block every single one of those.
EDIT: Incorporating the High Impact rule and actually reading the mission victory conditions properly alleviated many of my previous complaints :)

EDIT: Sold. Did not hit the table in over 2 years.

The game is relatively straightforward to play although there are some ambiguities as to what decision the aliens should make in their movement at times.  There are some additional rules that can feel a bit fiddly and there a lot of pieces in the game although not all are in play at once.  The alien AI is interesting to observe and interact with in many instances.  

So far, after the first two attempts, we've found the game to be very difficult.  Aliens move far and quickly making LOS in effect very quickly.  In some cases, I think charging certain aliens is the way to go as some prefer to shoot from a distance and will run away...others, you want nothing to do with them up close...or anywhere!  :-)  

The good thing is that people seemed to be interested in trying again although a different agent was desired in many cases.  

There was a comparison made to similarities with Gears of War but I'm not overly knowledgeable of that game.

Main downside is controlling the AI. At times, it can feel like you are playing against your own interests, but it is only a minor complaint.  Overall, I prefer the AI cards in Gears of War since they are pretty clear cut on how the Locusts should act.  However, they can feel a little stagnant compared to the GD AI cards.  In the long run, it may be a fair trade off to have more variety in alien encounters at the expense of sometimes working against yourself.

Missions are a little annoying - a lot of one-off rules for each scenario.  There's also a fair amount of set up time.  Maps are static.

After one play - Yes, similar to Gears of War, but a bit more lively, though complex with it. Lots of referencing rules on my first play, but happy with how different the aliens are and with the stacked card decks to give a good mission progression and difficulty balance.

Edit: Traded for The Great War; just too many rules going on, too much upkeep on the alien turn, too many inconclusive die rolls...Felt like I was playing on the alien side more than my own turns.

While the core mechanics are solid, the AI system is lacking a bit. Playing to the best of your ability for the aliens isn't always as easy as picking A or B and some guidelines would have been nice to include. 
The campaign mode also has it's problems because once a character dies they lose all the experience that they've gained and can only gain so much per mission, and characters DO die in this game. Easy to house rule, but I'm just not into that. 
For the most part, the game is extremely fiddly. Managing the AI is a pain in the ass sometimes considering you don't do too much on your own turn. 

I really want to like this game, and parts of it I really do, but overall it's just not worth it.

Solid co-op game set in alien science-fiction universe. I'm always tempted to play a ridley scott movie in the background while playing this game. I've played four times, and have yet to win, but I am excited to go back and try again. The rules are not too difficult, and I appreciate all the examples includes in the guide. Best part of the game for me is the campaign option (and free iPad app to track stats) which allows me to keep my character and his/her level ups through subsequent (and more difficult) missions. Fun game, hard to beat, but great challenge. 

**Update - Played the same first challenge several times, and I think I barely made it to the next. Unfortunately, because I could not string the challenges together, I stopped playing it and lost interest. You can always play the missions separately, but I was attracted to playing the whole game campaign style (building up the character, amassing weapons and such). Unfortunately it didn't work out, and I got bored.

Fantastic!  The core takes the guts of the D&D system games (Castle Ravenloft and its ilk) and combines it with the blip system from Space Hulk.  Add great tactical combat rules, a great campaign leveling system, and mostly great components (some of the maps are a bit muddled/busy - a very minor criticism) and the package is one of my favorite new co-ops.

Medium complexity cooperative ameritrash. XCOM theme.

It has a campaign mode and achieves the balance allowing players to level up only once per adventure.

This is a great solo/co-op game. The AI for the aliens works well with the area/hex system. Occasionally the player(s) need to make a choice for how the alien should move but it doesn't bother me. 

The two minor issues I have are: 

until you've played the game once or twice the aliens and alien cards can be a little difficult to identify. The rulebook just shows an alien image in the storybook for setting up the alien deck. So you need to know the figures or download the file that a user created here on the game page. 

There are multiple symbols on some die faces. Players can easily overlook symbols, especially when they get excited about counting hits (then overlook their weapon jammed).

I was already excited about the modular board, excellent minis, strategy vs alien AI hoarde and such but the execution of the thing was amazing.  We lost BADLY the first mission, but had so much fun doing it that it didn't matter.

This game is a hot mess, and I like it. GD is a cooperative Ameritrash game of tactical combat, and it is brutal. The aliens keep coming and keep hitting and are hard to bring down in my limited experience. There is a built in campaign system with new weapons, skills, etc as the heroes level up. So, why a mess? Mostly the rule book. After three plays there are still some fundamental things that are unclear, particularly regarding terrain/movement. Annoyingly, the rules are also filled with typos and strange grammatical errors. I’m having a lot of fun playing it, but it’s difficult to recommend it over something like Descent, unless you’re looking exclusively for the pure cooperative experience. 

After finishing the campaign, I've lowered my rating and opinion of this a bit. Like many of these pure co-ops (e.g., Mice & Mystics / D&D Adventure Games), the thing just gets too repetitive over time.

Bloated, slow dicefest with precious little real tactics or strategy.

With the right party, it could be fun, but the fundamental problem cannot be overcome: Rolling a set of dice for hits and then rolling [amount of hits] dice for defense is the equivalent of making something cool happen and then unmaking it. Constantly. You do this every time and it not only bogs the game down nor is it only unsatisfying, it's anti-satisfying. It drains satisfaction.

this game epitomized what can be bad about thematic dungeon crawl hack and slash board games.

It is fiddly even by those standards.  The early missions are ridiculously easy.  The game has hugely high variance mechanics, including how leveling up is purely random!  There are virtually no choices at all -- I played scenario 2 and never made a choice and never worries about losing.  AT least the scenarios aren't too long, but they are long given that there are no strategic choices at all ever.

I can imagine that there is a scenario that is clever enough and carefully balanced enough to warrant a 5/10.  But that's the best possible given the game engine.

I found both this one and Robinson Crusoe around the same time and I'm feeling quite fortunate these days.  This game works.

The character powers and upgrades are a blast and the scenarios have been well thought-out so far.  Painting the figures and keeping this one for a long time.  *Update* - 9 plays through and I feel like I'm done.  I've had to change the rating as well.  The setup and downtime has finally got to me. And it's feeling quite samey as we go along.  Hate to see it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The closest thing on the market to "X-Com: The Boardgame".  

Galaxy Defenders is a fully-cooperative scenario-based miniatures game ala the D&D adventure games, Mice and Mystics, Myth, Shadows of Brimstone, Gears of War, etc.  The game can be played with one of 12 stand-alone scenarios, or in a campaign mode where your outcome from previous missions affect future missions and characters can level up.

It's a good game overall, but it just gets too fiddly for me to really enjoy it as a solo game.  Too much time is spent resolving enemy AI, line of sight, dice symbology, etc, and playing through a full 5-agent mission can easily take 3-4 hours (much longer than the mission book's estimates).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Edit: My initial impression was that Galaxy Defenders was enjoyable and that solo play was a good alternative. However, my rating has dropped from a 10 to a 6 for one reason: Combat. 

I don't enjoy heavy luck in games; after four plays of GD, it felt like a dice fest. Because combat relies so heavily on dice, strategy only goes so far. In the end, winning comes down to if what you roll (to attack) is better than what the aliens roll (to defend). I'm not against dice. I like dice. I enjoy RISK and the Space Hulk card game because dice rolling is (for the most part) fair. In GD, the more hits you roll, the more dice they get--and the greater their odds of blocking your hits and/or activating a special ability to heal themselves or gain armor. So, let me get this straight: You attack an alien with "guns, lots of guns," but it's possible they'll be more powerful after the attack than before. Huh? How does that work? This shouldn't happen.

Overall, I didn't enjoy Galaxy Defenders. With lots of aliens on the board, you'll manage the aliens more than your own Marines (and the fiddliness doesn't end there). The game feels too much like work and not enough like fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This game hits all my sweet spots.  

- You can play it solo (when you do, it feels like you're playing X-Com)
- You can level up and get cooler gear
- Game is punishing but fair
- Campaign style play
- No overlord
- Great variety in the baddies
- Great variety in the missions
- Great minis
- Rules aren't too simple and aren't too complex
- Great co-op

Only downside so far is that the Enemy AI involves slightly too many choices.  The Xeno-Greys especially make you pause to think and I don't really want to think about the enemy AI when it's supposed to play by itself.  Other than that small nit-pick, I love me some GD.

Fantastic game with great theme!. Really enjoy the minis which add nicely to the atmosphere of the game. I already find myself scheming to get my hands on the expansions. Love the campaign with durable changes/upgrades to the characters. The deep tactical play with significant choices to be made each turn keeps me engaged from first to last.

2 challenges with this game - table space and play time. A fairly large table is required and missions can take many hours to play through. Probably best to be able to play a mission over several shorter sessions rather than 1 long one.

I like it a lot so far.  It's a nice co-op, probably susceptible to alpha player syndrome, but as I'm just playing it with my wife, that's not much of an issue.  The rules are poorly laid out, but once I got my head around them, they're not difficult.

I like the way the game runs the aliens.  The priorities on the Alien Cards give you something to work with; sometimes you can manipulate them to your advantage.  But since you don't know exactly when a particular alien will activate, it's not easy to do so.

Some of the missions require a certain number of agents, which is slightly frustrating - we'll each control 2.5 agents when we get to mission 5 - but the campaign seems well-designed so far, with leveling up providing a moderate boost to an agent's power.

Repetitive and not much going on sigh, creates no action stories/memories. Some few nice design ideas yet as a whole it's funless somehow (to me), very little decisioning or tactics, no strategy (and I don't mind dice/draw fests at all). 
Played 4 times to be sure to avoid it in a future. My gaming-feelings are influenced by the bright existence of Earth Reborn, to be fair. 
Regarding coop style, I'd prefer GoW.. 
Otherwise great production efforts and future plans for a title. Nice looking piece even with average sculpted pieces imho.

Good fun, plenty of scenarios, really enjoyed this BUT GoW is better.

Update Jan 2016 - sold. With Space Cadets: Away Missions and Gears Of War (and ToEE) on the shelf, there was just no reason to own this anymore as it just wasn't going to get played. Too much detail in this one, and this took away from the fun as it makes it tough to just pick up and play - with SCAM and GOW you can just open the box and get on with it.

RATING: 7
Base mechanics are good, but advancement is a bit dull, a few mechanics are flawed, and some scenarios have problems out-of-the-box (but are potentially improved by updated versions posted online).
Gameplay is generally fast and exciting. The alien AI is overall well done, and the different Agents have unique strengths and weaknesses. Excellent system if you want to use it as a toolbox to make your own missions.

Co-op game where up to 5 players are a tactical team of agents defending the earth from an alien invasion.  Each of the 5 different agents have different abilities.

The game comes with a dozen different missions with different objectives.  Different missions require differing numbers of agents.  Most of the missions allow you to play with almost any number of agents with a few requiring specific numbers of agents.

It feels like I'm part of the military unit in the movie Aliens when playing this game.  Each agent plays very differently in how they contribute to the team.  I've seen 4 of the 5 agents in action now.

There are a lot of rules, but with the quick reference card, the game went fairly smoothly.  Still there was a lot to keep track of.  I played it twice and there were still little things here and there that I forgot to do.

The combat and abilities seem pretty straight forward.  That's where the meat of the game, killing aliens, is.  There is a lot of dice rolling.  You roll to attack and then you roll to defend.  Often the end result of rolling several dice is that you may end up only dealing like one point of damage.  It gives you the illusion that you'll be laying a huge beating, when you roll a lot of hits on your attack dice only to have almost all of the hits negated after rolling defence dice.  It sometimes get frustrating as it feels like you should be dealing more damage when you roll so many dice.  One of my friends wanted to use a weaker weapon because then the enemy doesn't roll as many defence dice.  All this dice rolling does seem to make the game drag out.

Overall, I really like this game.  As someone who prefers shorter games, I would definitely want to play this again.  I'll just have to really set aside a whole night for this game next time.

RATING: 6
Great game, very good skirmish. AI is varied and campaign mode is better as the one in Gears of War (the most similar game to it), which is more a series of plays with fixed setups.

Two downsides: lack of a decent lexicon in the rulebook for reference purposes (though the player aids are great), and though it contains a leveling system, I would've preferred a leveling system akin to World of Warcraft: The Boardgame or Descent.

Varied maps, varied player powers, varied AI. If you want only one sci-fi skirmish miniature game, get this one.

[EDIT Apr 2016] Getting back to this game, we found the rules quirkiness/difficulty greatly increases after the first few scenario's, making us flipping rulebooks when we actually like to play. Also, playtime goes up without giving the accompanying satisfaction of better loot/more interesting monsters etc. I found I was longing to play Gears of War again, something which surprised me to no end. 

As it is, it quickly moves away from GoW playstyle towards the more involved Earth Reborn. However, I find that game superior to Galaxy Defenders and that means there is no reason for keeping this in my collection. Will be traded/sold.

Soooo... Galaxy Defenders is kind of a hot mess. Should that be surprising? It is a Kickstarter game after all.

We had a four hour game where our medic died after taking one turn. He was grabbed by the 6-legged arachnids and dragged to his doom. Whilst a mildly interesting story, it hardly made for an interesting game for that player who was out after about 15 minutes.

The killer robot from an earlier scenario turned up, close to the base, but without line of sight never activated. Hiding in the buildings seemed to completely nullify it.

Finally, perhaps because of the broken AI, the final few rounds were almost entirely without threat to the surviving players.

Despite all these major issues - downtime, massively early player elimination and a real lack of suspense (in a large part caused by a misplayed rule), I quite enjoyed it. I certainly have no need to pick it up though; Level 7 Omega Protocol does the same thing infinitely better. GD also over ran. It really should have ended an hour earlier, even with 5 players playing fairly quickly.

If you're okay with all of the above, consider Galaxy Defenders. But probably only solo it. I suspect that's when it is at its best.

Rating is probably a 7 if playing solo, a 6 based on how much fun I had (being in the mood for it and ignoring the massive downtime) and a 2 if I'd been the medic who died with over 3 hours left.

Need to play more to get a feel for the campaign mode.  Some of the mechanics felt a little weird to me like how some aliens might not activate for 5 turns while other aliens might activate 5 turns in a row.  There was a surprising amount of rules.  Seemed like we were looking in the rule book almost every turn.  But it has potential and I would definitely play again.

Played a second time with 5 people and it was way too long with brutal downtime.  Would not recommend playing with more than 3.

Nice miniatures, lots of great stuff in the box.
I have only played the first mission, but, it was really great.

Mechanism is simple yet rich. You are free to do almost everything you want. Difficulty is customizable and the game itself is not too hard but not too easy either.

The only con I see is the rulebook which is not that great to learn how to play. You got to be patient and retrieving a specific rule is quite annoying. (Furthermore, there are some mistakes in the kickstarter rulebook).

For [thing=138431][/thing] I did a short reivew mixed with session report. You can see it here: [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1138429/galaxy-defenders-short-review-mixed-with-a-littl]Galaxy Defenders - short review (mixed with a little of a session report)[/url].

To surmize: [thing=138431][/thing] is a cooperative and tactical battle game, having a sci-fi theme in which players are Agents sent to do all sorts of missions. The game that borrows things from many other games, in order to make something sort of new - the A.I. cards reminds the ones from Gears of War: The Board Game. The combat and movement are like the ones in Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition). The use of ammo and how to lose them is similar to the one in Doom: The Boardgame. It is like a big collage, but everything works together.

The first scenario took us around two hours (the estimated duration is 40 to 60 minutes, so you can see that we did fiddle around instead of doing what was necessary, but hey, it was fun!).

Anyway, [thing=138431][/thing] showed itself to be a fun game, with probably a nice level of difficulty. The components, as expected, are really good - the minis aren't the most detailed I have seen, but are still great. He have little problems with the rules - our main discussion was about the movement of the aliens, pondering with line of sight, distance, and the proper way they would act - but this was more a discussion as to made the best - most harsh - decision using the options A.I., than really a rules issue. I didn't learn the game through the rulebook, though.

***

After five plays, we aren't in love with the combat system: even if the Agent is able to make a huge attack, the defense always roll the same amount of dice as the total of the attack. Two times we had an attack of 7, but after the defense roll, both times only 1 point of damge was given! This can't be right - even when I considered the amount of luck involved. Also, the rule that the most wounded Agent always will be target (if the Aliens has LOS for two or more Agents, it will ignore the least wounded, even if they are closer, and will move to attack the most wounded), usually means that this Agent (and the player) has a bigger chance of dropping out of the game - I'm not a fan of character elimination, and the game wants to make this a even more likely event. No, no, no.

We found out that the designer offered some variants to fix these (and other) problems - like maximum defense of 5 (but this can bite you in the rear end later, as the Aliens in later missions will have bigger attacks), and the the Aliens won't necessarily hit the most wounded Agent, but will always go for the closest (which them can be the most wounded, but now you can actually try to position the Agents in a way to prevent this).

Anyway, the game lost some of its attraction to me, so I lowered its rating from 7.5 to 6.5. We will try some of the variants and see how they fare.

A bit disappointing...

Things I like -

- Love the AI for the aliens. Their behaviors feel clearly differentiated from each other. 

- Miniature quality is quite good, production quality good all around.

Complaints -

- I hate, hate the rule that defense dice are always equal to the number of hits obtained. All it does is make combat even more dicey than it already is. There isn't much you can do to mitigate die rolls.

- Rulebook is vague in places and very poorly organized. After reading the rules for facing ("human view") I needed to know how facing was determined after/during movement. It's not mentioned in the section on facing but is instead a note at the end of an entirely different section.

- Lack of interesting terrain or cover bonuses. Cover is one way to tactically mitigate dice, and it's utterly lacking here. You're either inside or out, and terrain either blocks line of sight or it doesn't. That's it.

If only someone had bothered to inform me that "Defenders" is secret code for "based on another game, but worse".

Defenders of the Realm = a dice-driven Pandemic that's been coated in plastic and stuffed into a piano box.

Defenders of the Stone Circle = a Stonehenge Anthology expansion that's more boring than rice.

Galaxy Defenders = a sci-fi translation of Castle Ravenloft's monster-activation and area movement system, but longer and less fully realized.

My plea to the next designer leaning towards a "defenders" game: Find a different line of work or buy a better thesaurus.

The game looks great, and features some very cool miniatures. I love how the rules are written, and even though an index would've been much more appreciated than the list of Kickstarter backers, you can find things rather quickly once you've gotten used to how it's organized (3 sections; General, Agents, & Aliens).

The gameplay is a ton of fun, but it definitely takes a few plays to just master all the procedures. Once you've mastered those, it will still take many games before you figure out how to play well. Yes, the game features luck, but there are so many neat interesting ways to mitigate the luck, but most take repeat plays to figure out. The dice rolling leads to much hooting and hollering. The campaign system is terrific, especially once I created a Google Sheet to track all the information.

The campaign included in the game is fun, and the game scales well from solitaire to a full five players with one Agent each, but the campaign is designed for exactly five Agents. Prior to the expansions, if two players wanted to play the campaign, one player had to control three Agents, and the other only two. Now, you can add some NPC Agents, and let each player still control the same number of Agents.

However, there were some issues in the first print run. The worst was fixed with a new rule called High Impact (which caps Defensive Dice at 5), please be sure to use this new rule.

1) Alien Targeting Priorities: Aliens always target the most Wounded, or lowest HP, Agent, even when incapacitated (i.e. Bleeding). This leads to players easily being eliminated from the game. You could easily fix this by simply having Aliens stop targeting Agents that are Bleeding, but of course, you also get better at avoiding this from happening the more you play the game. (This is helped a bit with the new Seize rules, that allows player Agents to carry each other to safety, and if you allow even grunts to do so, it may prolong their lives.)

2) Player Elimination: This is rarely fun, but in long game it's even less fun, and in the campaign mode without an included catch-up mechanism for leveling up it is brutal! (We play with a house rule that allows you to level up a number of times equal to the total number of Missions that the team has played, including the current one.)

3) Limited Actions: Your Agents gain new cool Tactics, Improved Tactics, and  Skills when leveling up their Agents. They also find tons of neat Devices to use during the Missions. However, they never have more than 1 Action per Turn, and all those things cost 1 Action to activate. (In the expansions Agents earn Free Actions.)

4) The Event Cards that teleport in more Aliens if they number fewer than the Agents seem to punish you for doing too well in the game, while the ones that just dump more Signals on you without any check on the in-game situation are just simply annoying. (The expansions offer some new Event Cards balancing mechanisms, but don't replace the Event Cards from the base game.)

5) Play Time: The worst offender is how the game is balanced to various number of Agents, which leads to the play time increasing exponentially with the number of Agents. One Agent in a 12 Event Card Mission will have 12 Turns, and at most 12 Alien Activations, while five Agents will see 60 Turns, and Alien Activations! That is just an insane difference. Take the Missions' listed play times and multiply them by the number of players for a more accurate listing. (The only fix for this issue is player efficiency.)

6) Mission Balance: Sadly the play balance with various player numbers impacts Missions where a lot of Movement is essential to accomplish your objective. In Mission #3 you have to cross 7-9 Areas, that is 21-27 Hexes, to get inside the buildings to search for the required Alien Tech Fragments. This takes 6-7 turns for Agents with Movement 4, so with only a single Agents this is 6-7 Alien activations, and with only eleven Close Encounter cards in the deck you may luck out and not see a lot of Alien action.

However, with just one additional Agent, you will now go through 12-14 turns, and therefore the entire Close Encounters deck, and with five Agents this is a sick 30-35 Close Encounter cards, meaning that you've gone through the deck three times over! (Fixed only by lots, and lots of repeat plays, and mastering the game's difficult strategies, and the best reactionary tactics to what it throws at you.)

All the critique aside, I adore the game!

A decent space marine game, but I was hoping for a bit more.  I liked that it was meatier than Space Hulk, but was hoping for a bit more on the tactics side.  The game reminded me of Doom more than anything else - especially if you were playing Doom with a solo variant.  The AI is pretty good although it can lead to some gamey moves if you know how the alien will behave.  I still find it incredibly annoying that sci-fi games routinely involve weapons that constantly seem to be jamming or running out of ammunition.  Why can't an advanced civilization develop a gun that can fire a dozen times in a row???  The rulebook is reasonably easy to understand although a few more examples or card/skill/device explanations would be appreciated.  Gameplay is decent, but it was not as interesting or tense as I was hoping for.  Seems hard to win so far.

RATING: 8
Pros:
Fun. Simple rules. Can play with anyone. I like the catch up mechanic. Set up is super quick. The pieces are very tactile. 

Cons:
The board is incredibly dull, but functional. A bit of colour on the board instead of grey would improve its curb appeal.

130923 Another gipf game.  Also an elegant abstract. And I don't know if or when I'd be interested in playing it again.  This rating is based purely on my inability to really appreciate perfect info abstracts.

RATING: 6
I can see the appeal in this abstract game, and it certainly looks beautiful -- but I need more plays before I can evaluate the strategy. I lost pretty quickly to a more experienced player (which is inevitable, especially in an abstract), but could definitely see myself playing again.

The best overall game in the GIPF Project and a great starting point for the series.  It is my second favourite (behind only ZERTZ).  I find the combination of positional play with the rings and seeming chaos with the piece flipping to be fascinating.  One of my favourite games and proof of Kris Burm's genius.  

My wife also really likes it, so we've played it quite a bit since we got it a few months ago.

Although I'm not really much of an abstract fan, I find that I've enjoyed this more than any other abstracts apart from Chess and Billabong.  It's fun to play, quick to understand and yet difficult to get a grip on - but crucially, not too difficult so that your brain hurts.  It comes over as a bit of a MENSA type game at times, but it's never so dry as to be dull.

There can be a bit of analysis paralysis, but generally not for every turn of the game.  I have found that my 8 year old, who is a pretty strong game player, can sometimes beat me at this.

If you want a picture of how this plays, think of the jumping elements of draughts (though things stay on the board and just flip), the getting in a row of Connect/Four in a Row (though here it is five) and the aesthetic qualities of Othello.  There's more to it than that, as there is balancing and quicker turn-arounds in the pieces, but that's a rough estimate anyway.

In my opinion, the best in the GiPF series. Breezy gameplay (not *too* thinky, just right) makes you want to have an immediate re-match, regardless of who's won!

The first time I played this, it followed on the heels of several plays of other abstract games that I generally like.  I can't put my finger on why, but it was hands-down more fun even though I understood what I was doing less.  I would like to get good at this game, and will play this at every opportunity to delve deeper through its layers.  X-in-a-row games and color-flipping games rarely hold my interest, but Kris Burm's combination of the two is brilliant. 

... Writing a year later, I have since played Dvonn and Zertz as well.  My review of Yinsh does not change, but I can place this in perspective of the other two.  Dvonn's strategy is more opaque, which makes it more intriguing to me.  This is more intuitive, but still with plenty of depth.  Zertz is also intuitive but less intriguing.  It seems to require less (how to put it?) lateral thinking... it's more straightforward and will reward whoever can program more moves ahead in their mind.

... Writing several years later, this is our most played game.  Maybe it is not my favorite game, but I suggest it the most often because it is quick to bring out and set up, has a satisfying playing length, and we are equally matched in ability making for a fun and engaging experience.

While the others (bar GIPF) seem to be about just one skill of abstract gaming, YINSH involves both positional ring play and the changing white/black tokens.

The only downside to this game as far as I'm concerned is the headache I get every time from thinking too hard! If you don't mind that and if you can live with the fact that it is abstract, this game is perfect. I would even say it is as good as chess (and yes, I am a chessplayer).
While the game is very chaotic in what happens on the board, there is still a lot of control. The best of the GIPF project I know so far (but I only just bought Pünct).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It plays well and most people seem to like it but, personally, I always lose at x-in-a-row games because I miss seeing that something is going to form a connection. There's never any tactical or strategic play that comes into my loss, I'm just poor at scanning and finding every danger spot on the board. So while it may be tactically or strategically rewarding for many players, I never get any of that due to a mental weakness for this specific style of game.

But I don't mind losing, so I'm generally happy to play it. Rating based more on how much others seem to like it than my personal impression, which is quasi-ambivalent.

Really?  Yes, this is an abstract, a famous one no doubt, and it is admirably spartan and minimalistic, but where-oh-where is the appeal or the...uhm...fun?  Gotta give this a 5 of 10.  March 2013

Okay, on the third play here in 2017, the game has some appeal when you consider it is fun to play with rings, and the game does have some admirable self=balancing mechanics.  Going to raise the rating to a 6.

I find it impossible to understand what's going on in this game or to see ahead at all.  Unlike in Zèrtz where such an admission would cause one to lose instantly and violently, here it doesn't seem to matter.  Maybe more play would change this.  Maybe.

One of the best in the GIPF Series.  With elements similar to Othello, player try to retrieve 3 of their rings.  With each ring removed the game play gets progressively harder.

Place a disc inside one of your rings, move that ring along one of the six directions until you get to an empty space (without passing over another ring) and flip each disc you passed over. If five in a row are your colour remove one of your rings from the board and you've scored a point, first to three points wins.

My first Gipf game, and definitely not my last.  A terrific, easy-to-explain abstract that is (surprisingly) exciting to play.  Having only played Dvonn and Zertz, I must say that Yinsh is easier to grasp and involves less calculation and "down time."  However, it still requires thought and concentration, especially when you realize how the placement of your rings affects and hinders movement.  My rating also reflects the rules, which are easy to grasp, and the pieces, which are of excellent quality.  A great introduction to the Gipf series.

An interesting two-player abstract. Players move five rings to leave tokens of their colour on the board, trying to get five in a row. They have to get five rows, but each row forces players to take one of their rings off the board, an interesting catch up mechanic.

A pretty astonishing find that exceeded my expectation. My parents that don't really enjoyed gaming actually like this. Plus it is simple and yet deep. Each play is pretty fast and bring 2 players, there is not much down time.

Initial Impression: I'm not a big fan of abstracts but this does it well. The components are functional, aesthetically pleasing, and have a nice feel to them. The rules are simple to teach and a game doesn't take long to play. The game blends othello's piece flipping mechanism with an interesting movement and jumping system. There's alot of tactical information to process in this game. Although it feels fairly chaotic to me now, I'm sure that patterns will become more apparent with repeated plays.

YINSH was the first game of the GIPF project we ever played. While not the best of the series, it was so well done that it conviced us to chase after the rest of the project whole-heartedly. As with all GIPF games, the board and pieces are of the highest quality. Game play is very good as well. A very clever idea to shrink the players number of pieces, rather than the board size or time options as with others in the project.

I love this and Dvonn.  I think Dvonn is a harder game to get any good at and this one is more accessible.  Cant decide which I like more but this one I will play with more people.  Looking forward to picking up a physical copy this year.

I'm definitely in the honeymoon phase with [i]Yinsh[/i].  The rules are clean and simple, without any of the "oops" scenarios like [i]en passant[/i] in [i][thing=171]Chess[/thing][/i].  The pieces seem to be well-made, although the board itself feels a bit off.  I think it's because the finish has been left as some sort of paper, without any lamination or coating whatsoever.  Any drink spilled on it will quickly be absorbed.

The game starts out feeling a lot like [i][thing=2389]Othello[/thing][/i], but quickly distances itself from that weaker entry by your ability to flip the markers of your own color to that of your opponent.  The ability of rings to act as blockers as well as "row guarantors" is very interesting.

I play this game with my seven year-old son, who absolutely loves it.  That recommendation in and of itself ought to be deserving of such a robust score, and [i]Yinsh[/i] deserves every point.  I look forward to future plays and exploring its depths of strategy more fully.

A fun quick abstract that isn't too thinky. The leading player having less rings combined with the fast changing board makes each game pretty close. I mainly play this with my wife, but my 4 year old was able to figure it out (although with him, we just play that the first one to get 5 in a row wins).

I like this game about as much, I think, as DVONN, which makes them the two top GIPF series games for me.  YINSH really is highly dynamic, and very fun to play, with pieces flipping from one side to the other, rings jumping around, and so on.  Easiest of the series to grasp and play, and easy to see why this one is so popular.

Pros :
- easy to learn, hard to master
- length
- excellent component quality
- multi-language rules

Neutral :
- would be nice if the board folded in six parts instead of four, thus making it more portable

Cons:
- unbelievably oversized box (only 10% of the box filled with actual game components !) 

Would rate it a 8 if not for the stupidly large box.

Othello-like abstract game that I found to be mediocre.  There is much more going on than in Othello, but still not really my cup of tea for an abstract.  Of course, I only played it once so I have very little to base it on.  The components in these games are really fantastic!

The best strategic abstract game I know. The flow of the game is really interesting, because the leading player is at a disadvantage once he scores his first one, or two points. Therefore you have to set up the end game, before starting the mid game. This makes the game very interesting.

Clean, easy to learn rules.  Games can play out very differently, showing this games depth of strategy. The key to me is the rings--they are used to add pieces and flip pieces, but possibly most importantly, to block each other's movement.

Yinsh is probably deeper than Dvonn, but not quite as accessible.  The game can feel quite arbitrary without some analysis of the consequences of various moves.  That can, unfortunately, lead to some considerable downtime for a two-player game.

Interesting abstract game.  Discs get flipped in Othello fashion from black-to-white (or reverse) when they are jumped by rings.  To win you have to make three sets of 5-in-a-row of your color... but the difficulty increases with each row that you make because you lose one of your jumping rings.

What a great 2-player game. I wish I had more opportunity to drag this out.  So easy to teach but very thought provoking and fun.  As a player starts winning sets, he loses rings so it gives the leader a slight disadvantage moving forward.  Seamus and I have had great games of this.

RATING: 10
Yinsh seems to cater to a variety of play styles.  You can play from the edge and turn it into a heavy thinking game, or you can play from the middle which causes a lot of shifts in the layout of the pieces and makes the game much more crazy and fun which is the way I prefer to play.  I like to to draw the wall huggers out into the middle where they're unfamiliar and constantly change the board around which screws with their mind!  Such a fun game destined to be a classic!

RATING: 6
Each move impacts where the rings are (which act as blockers) and what colours of disks are on the field. This is quite a lot to think about on each turn and is what makes the game quite brilliant. Options options options.

However, it's a lot to think about, more than I can handle it seems. I like losing games, however, I like losing because I played poorly in the turns leading up to my loss. In this game I frequently fail to see the easily blockable finishing move that's about to happen and then, lose. It doesn't feel good to lose this way, and it particularly doesn't feel good to win this way (after all, I didn't do anything clever, you just failed to see something that was right in front of your face).

My favorite abstract after chess.  Not as deep as that mighty beast of a mind-bender, but still fun and unique.  Losing a ring when you take the lead adds a nice self-balancing mechanism.  If you only buy one new-fangled abstract, I'd say this is the one.

Best of the Gipf series.  Obviously that's not saying much.  Kinda like saying Schempf was the most intelligent of the 3 Stooges.  I just can't get into abstract games that lack complexity in it's nature (chess, go, etc.) and don't have variable piece powers that create combinatorial play (chess, Hive, etc.)  I mean, seriously, what is the difference between these Gipf games and playing Chinese Checkers (Hah, for some reason it made me think of Punct, which is Gipf Chinese Checkers).  Because they are new, designer games with cool components and a $20 price tag? (Now I had to laugh because Tamsk is a $50 game)  Sorry, I just don't give a crap.

I'm not a huge fan of abstract games, but I do like Hive, Ingenious and the like. I do like Yinsh too, but it's strictly 2 player and my wife isn't a big fan of it. She tolerates it, but it isn't a game she would suggest which is the case with Ingenious/Qwirkle. Yinsh is a MUCH deeper game than those as there isn't any luck involved, but she likes a bit of luck in her games and therefore isn't as keen about this game. 

I like the Othello/Reversi aspect of the game, I like how you can position your rings so that you block the other player and finally I really like how you lose your rings and therefore a lot of influence on the board - this is a great catch-up mechanism!

My wife and I enjoy some thinly themed abtracts: Hey That's My Fish, Through the Desert, etc. But I was always a little hesitant to pick up a pure and "serious" abstract. However, a couple of plays of Yinsh on the computer convinced me to give it a shot.

I'm glad I did, as my wife really seems to like it with four quick back-to-back plays. She loves games with rather straightforward rules, very little fiddlyness, but tough choices. Yinsh fits the bill. I love the "classy" look of the bits, and because we don't approach it like chess, it offers a quick and nice brainburny couple's game for weeknights.

I find this superior to Dvonn and Zertz.  Along with Ingenious, this is one of my favorite abstract games, a genre I've admittedly never been quite as attracted to.  There is considerable depth in this title, yet I feel that I can approach it easier than Dvonn, which frequently leaves me with the feeling - what should I do now?  In Yinsh, I feel that I have the tools with which to both grasp strategy and tactics without giving it a deeper level of study, which Dvonn might possibly require.  Still can be a brain-burner, though.

What a delightful game!  YINSH is rare for me in that its aesthetics contribute to my enjoyment rather dramatically.  The feel of the solid, smooth, and surprisingly heavy pieces, the sounds of dropping the discs into your rings and flipping them over, and the appearance of the board position all feel 'just right' and add some lightness and spark to what might otherwise be a somewhat dreary affair.

The chaotic nature of YINSH, where the board position can and will completely change with just one move, has the great effect of scaling very well to its players' skill levels and/or interest in analysis.  YINSH seems especially well-suited to the chess clock method of handicapping, where the stronger player is not given as much time to analyze the situation.  Then again, the game can be set up and left around the house for a weekend, with players making their moves at their leisure.  Or, if both players are interested in a quick 20-minute competition, they can play casually, just remembering to keep the pace relatively quick.

A fantastic abstract that's wonderfully deep.  Since I grew up on chess, abstracts are always close to my heart.  The problem with most is that they are simply chess variants.  This, however, is not.

probably the funniest of the series? It seems to be the most approachable one, and the  easiest to understand due to the chaos. 

Very good balancing mechanic of losing control on the board when you score. 
It is also very exhausting played few times in a row

I'm not usually to keen on abstracts. So this is pretty highly rated for me. The components of the GIPF series are nice. Very simple and clean like abstracts should be. It is a brainburner and think there is real depth with so few rules--which is the most important qualities for abstract for me.

I've only played a few times, and don't feel that I have a handle on the basics of strong positioning yet.  I'm also not generally looking for 2-player abstracts these days. However, at one time I was very immersed in chess...so I can appreciate the simplicity and tension of Yinsh.  I think if an enthusiastic opponent surfaces some time, I can see myself playing this a lot more and the rating rising appropriately.  As it is...I just don't have much opportunity to play it.  After a couple playings, I prefer Dvonn...but that is very tentative and likely to change as I understand Yinsh better.

RATING: 6
YINSH seems to be a very tactical exercise, with a lot of blocking plays and calculated angle choices. The rings seem to have a very large movement range in this game, which makes the board change considerably from move to move, but part of the skill in playing it seems to be restricting the ways your opponent's rings can move while positioning yourself for the kill. 

I find it interesting how taking rows early can turn into a serious liability because your number of rings is reduced, which makes it easier for your opponent to manoeuvre and score themselves.

If you like abstracts this is definitely recommended, for my tastes, it's interesting but not amazing. I would never turn it down, but it is not something I would recommend in most situations. I much prefer the cruelty of ZERTZ and the odd time use of TAMSK to this.

Likes: Simple rules, even for an abstract. Lots of subtle things going on. The game has a nice catchup mechanic with that scoring takes away one of your pieces. Nice quality pieces too.

YINSH is pure strategy, but feels chaotic based on how quickly the board can change.  Unlike Chess, it seems pointless to think more than two or three moves ahead which makes this game very fast-paced, rewarding intuitive playing.  Games are usually close since winning a row of pieces in your color puts the other player at a tactical advantage.  Along with Go, this may be one of the best abstract games ever invented.

RATING: 8
I was introduced to YINSH at Essen 2004 and bought a copy there too. It can be described as a combination of Othello and Gobang on steroids. You create rows of five stones in your own colour as in Gobang, but are only allowed to place stones in 'rings' which after a placement need to be moved elsewhere. In addition, any stones skipped between the stone you placed and where the rings end up are turned over, revealing the other colour&mdash;a clear nod to Othello. If you have five stones of your own colour in a row, they are removed, as well as one ring of your choice. Whoever wins his third ring wins the game.

YINSH is a strong and beautiful abstract. What I've always disliked about Othello is that the board has strong and weak fields: because a corner cannot be taken it is automatically a desirable place to occupy. YINSH does not know about such fields as it is the rings which form the end of a row of stones to be turned over; [i]and[/i] because a row of 5 is removed from the game. These simple changes give the players a very strong feeling of control over their own destiny, both from a tactical as well as from a strategical point of view. And then there is a great little bite in that the better player has to [i]keep[/i] playing better in order to win, for he will have less rings on the board. 

If you like abstracts, this one is a must-play at the very least.

Components: Same great pieces as in the rest of the series. The board is subtle and attractive, and leaves enough room between pieces to manage the flipping.

Experience: Deliciously tense. Strategic strongholds form, which are unflippable, but which will disappear if used in a row of five. This game combines some of the better elements of Othello and Pente.

The removal of a ring after completing a row helps keep the game close. The air theme works well, as the contours of the boards shifts back and forth rapidly; but when a row of five is removed, it's also like an icepack breaking apart, and suddenly there are more possibilities on the board.

GIPF series rank: 2 of 7. Tossup whether I like this, DVONN, or TZAAR the best.

This is one of the better Gipf games, in my opinion.  It is difficult, but you can keep track of what is going on, and you can definitely find the "right" move, along with a lot of wrong ones.  This game definitely punishes bad moves harshly, but the fact that as you get closer to winning you get weaker mitigates this somewhat.  

The components of this game are very beautiful as well.

DS: With Yinsh, we enter the realm of Earthly Games - as Zertz and Dippy are the only ones close enough to perfection that I grade them above a 9. A 10 would mean there's never going to possibly be a better game ever, so a 9.5 is about the highest grade I can give.

This actually goes for all the Gipfses: I'm incredibly proud of my signed complete original set. I missed out on Tzaar, but I don't know what I'm missing so that's fine ;). Looking forward to the new Punct, actually. I might pick that one up, even if just for old time's sake.

Yinsh combines n-in-a-row and flipping elements from games like Reversi along with a negative feedback rule for the winning player. It has some low hanging strategic fruit for the beginning player but still retains a little too much "randomness" and unpredictability from the flipping of the pieces. Like most GIPF games, the playable area decreases as the game progresses.

Summary:
--------
Yinsh is an abstract game for two players. It is the fifth game in the GIPF series. The board for the game is made out of lines that form an oddly shaped hexagon.

The players each possess five rings in their player color (white or black). During setup, the players alternate the placement of their five rings around the board. After that, each turn you put one double sided marker (white on the one side, black on the other) in one of your rings with your color facing up. Next, you move that ring in a straight line, stopping on a space that isn't occupied by any marker. All the markers you moved over are then turned over to the opposite color. Once you managed to form a line of five markers of your color, these and one of your rings are removed from the board.

The first player to remove three of his five rings wins the game.

Comments:
----------
* This game is rather easy to explain. There is nothing in the rules that seems illogical. After about five minutes you are ready to go. The game itself is not as deep as chess, but I would say it has about the depth of Abalone.

* I like the built in catch-up mechanic. Everytime you manage to get five markers of your color in a line, you have to remove one of your rings. Although it is your ultimate goal to remove three of your five rings, each one missing limits your options. You have less rings to block your opponent and fewer places to bring new markers on the board. The game is kind of self-balancing in this regard: If you want to remove one of your rings, you better make sure that you don't cripple yourself too much.

* The bits are excellent. They look nice and have a very nice tactile feeling to them.

* I had fun playing Yinsh although I have to admit that it makes my brain hurt. I guess, I'm not the perfect audience for pure abstract games. But if you like them, give this one a try. It seems to be a winner.

Fun and nice production values, but I'm not sure if I'm a consummate enough abstract fan to get well practiced at these gipf games.

Yinsh is an extremely good game, and without a doubt one of the best games in the GIPF series. Personally, I like DVONN and TZAAR a little bit more, and perhaps I also find TAMSK more interesting (though of course, a completely different game). Yinsh seemingly takes the whole idea of GIPF, and improves upon it by adding a twist with the jumping rings. I somehow cannot exactly wrap my head around the strategy, but enjoy the game none the less.

I'll play Salieri on this one--I don't think I've won more than 20% of the games I've played (most of them against Isaac, who started playing when he was 6 and displays a remarkable intuitive grasp of abstract games), but I recognize the genius in the purity and conservation of the game design.

My first Gipf game, and I'm not in a hurry to get the others. This one will occupy me for a long while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Simple to play connectivity game.  Players take turns placing a marker inside one of their hollow ring pieces, then moving the ring to another location.  Any markers leapfrogged during ring movement flip them over to their reverse colour side.  If players can form a chain of five of their markers, they get to remove a ring from the board.  First to remove three rings wins the game.  Very nice abstract game, where early success is penalized by more restricted options (fewer rings).  Great stuff.

RATING: 7
After two playings I think it might be my favorite of the Gipf project.  Still not a big fan of 2-player abstracts-- I like learning them and exploring them enough to find some of the subtleties, but I don't have the energy to really learn to play well.  This one seems to play to my strengths somehow; I felt like I had more of an intuitive grasp on it than the others.  Plus it has the nicest components so far, although the board is dull.

I'll be the first to admit that luckless abstract strategy games are not my forte. Even bearing that in mind, this is one game that could make a convert out of anyone! 

Each player starts with 5 rings, that cruise across the board, blocking the other players rings and leaving behind tokens. The rules combine various elements from Othello, checkers, chess, go, and pente (!) into a fast and clever  experience.

RATING: 7
2-player abstract game, which seems easier to “get” than, say, Zertz or even Dvonn, due to the straightforward victory condition of needing 5 pieces in a row: an easy pattern to plan and look for.  The way that pieces can get flipped and the board changes is quite interesting (reminding one of Othello).  I also like the way that the leading player has less rings to move around, thus giving the trailing player a small catch-up bonus.  There are a lot of non-obvious options for players every turn.

My first - and possibly only - GIPF game, and it finally got played after months on my shelf.

This game is a beauty of a thing.  It is quite obviously abstract, but the strategy is very rewarding.  It also plays quite quickly, barring AP, which is a plus, as we got quite a few plays in our first session.

Very simply, both players start with five rings on the board (chosen by the players wherever they like) and you basically plop a marker in your ring and then move it.  If you hop over any pieces, you flip all of them, not just your opponent's.  If you make a row of five of your color (or your opponent does so for you), you pick up those pieces and then remove one of your rings from the board.  Remove 3 and you win!

Therein lies the genius of this game - the better you do, the harder a time you'll have of it as each time you score a row, you remove one of your rings, and rings are the only pieces you can actively move.  You essentially limit your options each time you score a point, and it is a viable strategy to score one for your opponent just to deprive them of one of their own rings.

The components are beautiful and the board is simple.  The only complaint is that the column/line numbering makes no sense, so hopefully you aren't the type to document your moves, a la chess.

RATING: 8.75
I played YINSH seven times in person.  YINSH is a very interesting Abstract Strategy game. YINSH has the possibility to be a 10 with more plays. 

YINSH is one of my most favorite 2 player games.

The last three games played were real thinkers compared to the first game. It's fun to see the different possiblities as the game progresses. There are lots of things to consider and think about during your turn. After all, you don't want to give a huge advantage to your oppenent during the game. If you do, you will might lose the game very easily.

YINSH makes me want to see other abstract games which are out there even if it's not what I like the most in board games. I also notice that lots or much abstract games are 2 players games.

Yinsh is my favorite abstract by far. I am considering looking into the other Abstract Strategy games in the series. Yinsh is my favorite in the series.


7 plays since recording games played.

One of the better abstracts, but it can be really tough to see more than a couple of moves ahead. At least for me it is!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
It's simple to explain (always a plus) and a lot of the basic strategy of the game will be obvious to even new players. The mechanic of using your own playing pieces to mark your score is nothing shy of genius, disadvantaging the lead player and keeping things competitive for all. I am always wiling to play this one, and love introducing it to new players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Yinsh is quite the brainburner.  The games I've played have been very finely poised with no certainty about who would win until the last few moves.  The pieces are really nice quality and I think this one will get a lot of play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun abstract that plays quickly. This game needs a severe re-theme, as it is incredibly ugly, but it works so well it doesn't matter. I love that as a player gets ahead, they become a little less flexible in their movement, always worth a replay.

15-30m, 2 players. 10+ plays.

My favorite of the Gipf project so far (although DVONN comes very close). Reminds me of Othello, but with a nice ebb and flow to it -- the board fills up, empties out, and fills up again. I also like the rings as a handicapping mechanism -- the person in the lead gets fewer pieces to move.

RATING: 6
This abstract really caught my eye in the top 50 which caused me to buy all of the GIPF series.  I haven't played them all but I feel like YINSH is going to be the head of the pack when all is said and done.  Very interesting mix of Othello and Connect Four.  Having the capability to play it on BSW is another plus.  This may not be the deepest abstract out there but I feel like it's probably the one that's the most fun.  That said, abstracts aren't my preference.

RATING: 8
[Abstract] [2P:8] Fluid, elegant new age abstract reminiscent of Othello. Players control five disc-spitting rings which reverse the colors of any discs they jump over. If there are five discs of a player's color in a row, that player takes that row and one of his rings off the board. First player with three rings off wins, but with less rings, it gets harder to get five discs in a row. Excellent 2P abstract. Too bad I suck so badly at it. Losing doesn't detract from the pleasure of playing. At least not too much. I've already blown several 2 to 1 ring leads... sigh. Prefer to play with a 7-minute timer per player to up the tension. *** UPDATE: Really enjoying Yinsh. I think playing Reiner's Ingenious has helped in "seeing" Yinsh better. Won't change my rating until I've played a real live copy of the game, but this rating is likely to improve to an 8 eventually. Intention to acquire. ***UPDATE: Ok, I give. This is the most fun I've ever had playing an abstract. Yinsh beats the socks off chess or go or ingenious or anything else simply because of its personality. And it's schizoid, too, changing from free flowing, river redirecting, lighting crashing flashes of light, to close in, mud roiling, bone breaking trench warfare. It's anything but boring. Until I try its brother Tamsk, this is the best abstract out there. ***UPDATE: Now that I've tried TAMSK, YINSH is a strong second place in my ranking of abstracts. That's still damned good. It's just that TAMSK is awesome.

Great abstract game.  The only part of it that I don't care for is having to place my pieces on the board at the start of the game.  I feel like I should be employing some sort of strategy in the placement, but with such a large blank board in front of me I get agitated trying to think of what the best move would be.  We just place them down at random and start playing.

I already love Othello, so any game that builds on that gets a star in my book.  However, Yinsh builds on the Othello substrate and actually improves it.  Of particular note is the built-in handicapping mechanism for the lead player. I love games where critical game pieces also double as goals or resources and Yinsh balances this masterfully.

I haven't played many pure abstracts that I found as elegant as YINSH.

Played twice with my wife after teaching her the rules.  I love how the board can change so much in a matter of a few rules.  It looks amazing and allows for a lot of strategy.  This is a great abstract game.

Some of my students have started to really enjoy the strategic depth to YINSH.  There is a great deal of complexity, and I love how it becomes harder to stop your opponent when you get ahead and have to remove a ring.  

If it were up to me, this game would replace copies of Connect 4 in classrooms.

Thoughts after a couple of moves: it's like gomoku X reversi (othello)!
But then, after a few games, it's so much deeper, how you have to use the rings for attack, counter-attack and defense, and the balancing mechanism of losing a ring when you win a row.
Great abstract game, bye bye gomoku and reversi!
I will probably bring it to every game night from now on, in case I need a 2-player filler...

YINSH is fascinating to me, despite the fact that I don't understand it beyond a very basic tactical level. I'm enjoying the complex, beautiful, and sometimes unpredictable way that the board can develop. I don't know whether I'll ever develop a more intuitive grasp of the game, because the decision tree is so broad and the board patterns are so unstable. While it's sometimes frustrating feeling so bewildered by the game, I think I like it that way.

RATING: 7.5
The most free-form of the Gipf series; the board has more vertices than any game except Pünct, the pieces have a greater range of movement, and the situation has more potential for change from turn to turn. For this reason Yinsh is the game for which good play is the least dependent on experience and the most on raw talent and creativity, though it might appear chaotic to those more used to the claustrophobia of the other games. All in all another great installment in a great series. Viva Burm!

RATING: 7.5
I like this game a lot.  Too bad I usually lose.  The mechanic of losing strength as you get closer to victory (you must remove a ring for each line you create) helps to keep both players in the game until the end.  [And can make taking the early lead undesireable.]  Another positive addition to the GIPF cycle of games.

Another wonderful abstract in the Gipf series. Someday I'll have them all, even though I rarely get a chance to play them.

It has some similarities to both Pente and Othello, but it is a very different game.

The board for YINSH might just win an award for the most boring looking board in existence.  But once it gets populated with all these rings and discs, the game really comes alive.  It's black vs white at its finest.  If you enjoy games like checkers or chess, this game might be right for you.

I'll be lazy and paste my DVONN comment here:

"I respect good abstracts like this because:

2) no attempt to throw in a lame "sophisticated" Euro theme, or a "look, we're blowing stuff up" theme.  It is what it is.  And it IS."

Yinsh seems a bit deeper, but can get a bit long as both players develop mad skillz.

While I usually don´t play any abstract games (as most of them are just not my cup of tea), this one is one of the best abstract games I´ve played.

Very clever, deep and "balanced". Balanced? Yeah, as the player has to get 3 of his pieces off the board, while you have less options with fewer pieces!

What I like most about this game, is the overview. You can always see everything and of course, plan ahead, but unlike many other abstract games, you won´t be lost in all those options you have.

One of the best of the GIPF games, YINSH comes on like Othello on steroids, with increasing handicaps as you get closer to winning the game. but the handicaps mean you'd better be watching closely or they will turn the tables.

Players select an initial board position, and then move their 5 rings about the board, using them to flip discs as they pass over them, and stopping at other rings or at the board position the player selects.

When players create a line of 5 similar discs (somewhat similar to a Mill in nine Men's Morris), they remove the line and bear off 1 ring of their choice, with the 3rd ring borne off winning the game.

But as a player bears off rings, they limit their ability to stop their opponent from doing the same.

Both in the ring motion, the self-limiting factor as players bear off rings towards the win, and the endless scanning for what the opponent is headed for next, this is a fun, but tough game which stays close and exciting for players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is surprisingly fun and addictive!

I'm not the biggest fan of abstract games, especially very stark looking ones.

But YINSH has the ability to draw people in from the first move, as the rules are so simple to grasp.  

The fact that your playing pieces get removed as scoring counters means that getting closer to the finish line really taxes your reserves.  Clever, simple, fun.

Yinsh is a game of pure strategy. It is fun to play and gets harder for the person who is winning, giving the person who is behind a chance to catch up and possibly win the game. As the game progresses, there become fewer rings and it is harder for the pieces to capture one another. Better make sure that your piece is in the center of play for this one, you don't want to be out of play and off to the side!

[b]Update:[/b] Wound up buying it. It's so engaging and clever. There's this dance between the two players and you're fainting and misdirecting and if you're lucky, your opponent will go in a direction that opens you up to create a row. A very, very clever game. Am really digging the other GIPF games, too.

This is a great little abstract strategy game which plays relatively quickly and is distinctly different from Go and Chess.

I love this game. It is a very dynamic game, where the movement of the rings allows you to both work on making 5 in a row on one end of the board, and attack someone elses five at the other end of the board. As any good abstract, there are many different viable strategies, and this is a game where you don't need to spend hours playing to get the full enjoyment of it. The game will be more enjoyable the more you play, but it will be fun from the start.

I don't have enough experience with abstracts to say whether I like them in general; I do know that I often find two-player games to be frustrating and unfulfilling.  Not so with YINSH.  Thus far, I suspect that it is eminently replayable and I find the development of the board over the course of the game unaccountably fascinating. 

EDIT:  I still have a lot to learn about this game--the rings actually serve multiple purposes and using them to manipulate the board is what really makes this game interesting--and losing them as you win is (as many others have commented) a very, very clever element of this design.

RATING: 7
First played February 7th, 2008. Taught in <5min, played in ~15min. This two player game is strategy weighted in the strategy/luck scale. After playing Gipf previously I had some ideas of what to do. The game has some similarities, yet it's different. The object is to be the first to have 5 chips in a row of your color. The board is a grid of triangles. Each player has 5 rings which are placed on intersections before the game begins. These rings serve as entry points for your chips and a mechanism to alter color of chips on the board. Once you place a chip inside the ring, you can move it along a line in any direction. You can't cross over your opponent's ring and must stop at the first open intersection after crossing over chips, otherwise you can move it as many intersections as you like(staying on the board). If moving it crosses over other chips, it flips each to the other side. Once you get 5  in a row of your color, remove 5 chips and then remove any one ring from the board. Removing the ring then makes it more difficult to get your next set of 5 since you have one less "blocker" as well as entry point. I'd recommend giving this a try if you know someone who has it, otherwise give it consideration for purchase if you like abstract strategy.

The movement in this game is what I like best. I like putting the little circles inside of the rings and then moving the rings.

The rings can also be moved to block your opponent very effectively. You have to be carefully in how you move or you could end up giving the pieces you worked so hard on to the other player with a simple jump on their part.

Great logic game.  I can see why it's currently in top 100 of the bgg ranking (among logic games lower only than Go).

The possibilites and repercussions of every move are mounting here, yet the rules are very very simple.
This game is difficult to master - it's very hard to work out an efficient strategy (the game is more on the tactical side).  But probably I still played too little.

Final verdict: I LIKE it (and generally I'm not hot on logic games).

A good abstract strategy game, feels like a convoluted version of connect four combined with Pente and Othello but more like Pente with a little more to think about. 

I was hoping for a little more depth, however this does get you thinking/planning and my plays after the intial play did reveal a little more than I first seen.  The style of thinking is very similar to Pente where you need to work towards setting up the intersections, if you like this game you should like that one too, it is a little lighter and faster than this however. Dvonn certainly seems more subtle than Yinsh and maybe has a little more depth.

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 7.5 => 8.5 Okay after game 2 & 3 the depth has revealed itself here really adding to the game, still not the deepest of games here but it is a very good fast moving and FUN game. Several moves can be planned ahead, maybe less than chess but this is a great dynamic game playable in 25 minutes or so with very little AP which is great for an abstract. 

Yinsh has depth but moves fast as it is the most fluid of the series keeping it FUN, this rises it above the others for anyone looking for the fun aspect. Brilliant balance in this game as when you take a lead you must remove one of your rings making it harder for you thus evening the playing field so to speak.

Grid Movement - Pattern Building
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another Gipf Project game. Has shades of Othello, but much more interesting. You have several rings in motion that change the colour of the pieces when they fly over them. The board is constantly changing.

RATING: 7
Nifty. Works like Othello crossed with Go-Moku, but it feels like neither. A brain-burner that I still don't have a good grasp on.

RATING: 8.8
Bokkensprong 20/04/12 met Ward (en Ward met Kobe). 
Beetje zoals dammen, maar dan moeilijker omdat markers steeds van kleur wisselen als er een ring over springt. Tof abstract denkspel voor twee spelers. Korte "blitz" speelversie mogelijk (wie eerst vijf op een rij heeft, wint).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
So far an all-time great game for me.  For an abstract, it has a great narrative arc.  There's plenty of back and forth action.  The leading player, while closer to victory, is at a ring disadvantage, weakening their position on the board.  And there's just enough chaos to create a mistake every once in a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is my favorite 2 player abstract game. It's tops in the Gipf series of games, imho. I only own Dvonn, Yinsh, and Zerts. All quick fun and a mind bender if your into that kind of thing.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (May 2013)

I wanted to play this game for a long time. As expected, the game is easy to learn, hard to master. The rules are pretty easy, you can teach the game under 4 minutes. The gameplay is very deep, you have many options so you have to carefully consider each move. I really like it.

The game´s components are also pretty nice.

Abstract games are not my favorites, but lately, I want to play them more and more (furthermore if they are connection games). Yinsh has the potential to go up in my ratings with more plays, for now I want to play again and I (probably) will buy the game.

After a couple of games, I’m enjoying Yinsh a lot. I still suck at it and I’m not able to pass over the tactical aspect of the game, I still cannot plan ahead but I’m getting better.

I want to play more, so I’m upgrading its rating to a 7.0

RATING: 7
There is breadth here I was not expecting. There's the expected depth, but the choice of plays and manouvres that started to become apparent only during the game was quite astonishing. Preserve a line by leaving one ring at the end of it. Build from the edge. Block your opponents' rings with your rings. Block options from three of your opponents rings with just one ring of your own. Deliberately set up one of your own colour between two of your opponents so that your opponent is (needlessly) reluctant to turn your key piece. And with final satisfaction, set up a string of moves to go from zero to three in just four steps.

Modernized othello. Very chaotic abstract, with board changing every move. Very clever and intriguing mechanic of rings being the actual "pieces" and counters being the "effect". Rated a tad lower than other gipf games because I feel players have less control over strategy; but that may just be my lack of skill. And it's certainly a thrilling ride.

More strategic than DVONN and ZERTS and on par with GIPF.  YINSH, by all appearances looks pretty and innocent enough, however, it seems to feel more like a chore to play than the others of the 'Project GIPF' series.

Perhaps the Gipf entry that best combines brain-burning depth with fun; there's enough that's familiar about the game to make it easy to jump in, and enough that's new to make it challenging to plot your moves.  Beautiful components, too, as good as Dvonn.

Very simple, quality components, deep game.  The disappearing rings is a nice touch, and makes the game somewhat interesting even when the players aren't evenly matched in skill.  It is unfortunate that one of the more effective strategies is to work around the edges, placing unflippable checkers.  Still a good game, as that strategy is not foolproof, and the side rings often get immobilized.

"I've played Yinsh, Zertz, Tzaar and Dvonn, and Yinsh is by far my favorite. The way I describe it to myself, Dvonn and Zertz are about managing limitations; as each game progresses, you have ever fewer viable moves. Tzaar starts off having ever more viable moves, but halfway in turns around and has ever fewer, while Yinsh alone feels like its number of viable moves keeps increasing throughout the entire game, and so is about managing possibilities. It feels wonderfully open (and mindbendingly complex) to me, and I love it to pieces. One of my two 10 ratings. (Tzaar is my 2nd favorite of those I've played, Zertz 3rd, and Dvonn last.) "

"An abstract that is surprisingly enjoyable for non-abstract gamers. Even if you don't normally like abstract games you should try this one."

"The better you do in the game, the harder it is to win (common in whole GIPF series).  For you to win the game, you've really got to overpower your opponent."

RATING: 7
Yinsh feels like a combination of several other abstract games. Five in a row (Pente, Gobang) is the goal, discs are flipped when moved over (akin to Othello), movement rules for the rings (variation on Checkers) add another layer. The whole here is more than the sum of its parts and its rating as abstract #1 testify to its longevity and depth. After two games, I don't grasp what constitutes good play. My impression is that positioning the rings to maximize freedom of movement might be one key. Dominating the middle might be another one. I might be wrong and I don't want to read up on strategy yet.

BGG acquisition. I'm not normally a fan of abstracts and this was a 'purchase before playing' buy due to its ranking. Not disappointed, and the on line robot does help to learn how not to play.

After a few face to face plays i'm still not sure where to rate this game. There is no theme, there are extremely tactile components, there's a lot of brain burning, it has just the right game length, but the connect 4 / othello feeling just sours it just a little bit for me. The overall feel is positive but (like many purely 'thinking' games) an experienced player will probably beat most novices. Taking off rings when successfully making a line of 5 is a great leveller though.

RATING: 6.5
Does starting setup matter? Will I ever get good enough to notice? I don't know. This game is difficult to plan ahead - maybe reasonable to plan 1 or 2 moves ahead but that is a stretch. Very tactical. One of the better abstracts I've played but I just don't care for them overall.

Setup: (10)
Setup is part of the game and much of your strategy will depend on it.

Area required to play: (10)
Almost everything is contained on the board. The only area outside the board needed would be enough room to hold pieces not yet in play. The box would work for this.
 
Fun: (10)
It is, of course, a different kind of fun than a thematic game or something of that nature. Still, it's a blast if you're in to abstracts.

Theme Integration / Mechanics: (10)
This game is completely abstract with no theme whatsoever. The mechanics that drive it are seemingly flawless.

Replay Value: (10)
This is a game that will be played for years and years to come.

I was taken aback by the high-quality production values on this game. The GIPF people don't mess around, do they? Nice, substantial rings and a well-made, flat-sitting board. Well done.

The game itself is fascinating, with a number of strategies - you can start near the edges to make it easier to get your first line, but this limits what you can do later. There're enough rings to keep track of that it's easy for your opponent to sneak up on you. This is a great abstract game, well-made and with unexpectedly complex positional play. What's more, you can play it online for free.

And as a further bonus, it's the rare game that my girlfriend likes.

2015-06-28 - 8 - Very good abstract game for 2 players. Simple rules, but deep gameplay, which changes with players gaining more experience. It's quick which is a good thing in abstracts for me. Two interesting thing about it. One - the board gets more crowded with every move, so you can't turtle and it forces to adapt to the situation all the time. Two - you get weaker when you are closer to the victory, so your opponent may take advantage of it.

2015-07-04 - 8->8.5 - Awesome abstract, I like it even more.

2015-07-13 - 8.5->9 - It's really great. It will probably get into my top 10, which I update every January.

2015-11-06 - 9->8 - After more than 30 plays it's going back to the initial rating. Still very, very good game and I think it is as good as an abstract game can be.

While I like all of the GIPF-series games this one is my favorite. A mixture of Othello, Go, and Chess, YINSH is quick to learn, fairly quick to play, and I've yet to develop a strategy I was able to carry through more than three games despite dozens of plays. One wonderful thing about YINSH is that, unlike many two-player abstracts, there is a mechanism in the game that allows for handicapping.

A great 2 player abstract that will be a classic.  I own everything in the GIPF series, and this is the first one I played.  The quality of YINSH's pieces are by far better than GIPF's.

The game is subject to analysis paralys, but since it's two player, that's OK cause generally you'll be looking the board over clamoring for a setup.

The game plays very quickly, and has built in leader control.  Whenever you score, you have to take one of your rings off the board, which lessens your ability to set up tactical positions and gives your opponent the ability to catch up...can you keep one step ahead of him and pull the win?  

Games are always close and lend "just one more time" attitude.

My favorite abstract game. It is extremely well designed! It is impossible to lose a game of yinsh without at least making a row, which makes it feel a lot more even! The game cannot really snowball, because the board itself is dynamic and can be used for either player's favor, and the main thing that is constant is how well placed your rings are.

If it can somehow get itself into the mainstream, it might end up being one of the few of today's games that the world is playing hundreds of years from now. [b]9[/b]

This is a pretty easy game to learn, which is a nice feature of lots of good abstract games.  Good gameplay can be a little difficult to grasp at first, making the game very tactical, but you can certainly develop some beneficial strategies over time.  The components are nice enough, but the abstract simplicity works just as well online at BSW.  The game can play pretty quickly while still offering a satisfying experience.

The players each start with 5 rings on the board. Every time a ring is moved, it leaves a marker behind. Markers are white on one side and black on the other. When markers are jumped over by a ring they must be flipped, so their color is constantly changing. The players must try to form a row of 5 markers with their own color face up. If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove 3 of his rings wins the game. In other words, each row you make brings you closer to victory-but also makes you weaker, because you have one less ring to play with. Very tricky!

Several plays.  I really like this game, in spite of my inability to provide any real challenge.  There's something about it, though, that keeps it from being my favorite of the series.  I think it's that so often, I screw something obvious up...pretty much all my fault.

Yinsh is a very good 2 person abstract. I am still experimenting with strategies.  I would rank it equally with Dvonn and behind only Zertz in the Gipf series.  I have been struggling lately to find a way to combat the wallhugger strategy often used by my opponents on BSW.  Playing the game consistently at the edges makes for a less interesting game in my opinion (but it seems to bring good results -- although I've heard that's not the case at the highest levels of play).

This game is fun, and also difficult (I have never won a game against a person or the boardspace AI).  However, there is little way to plan more than 1 move ahead because the board can change so drastically on each move.  Within the GIPF series, I prefer the slowly-decomposing DVONN, which allows for more long term look-ahead since the board can only change so much each turn. 

YINSH is a tough, thinky abstract that I am willing to play, but is a little too chaotic for me to want to own it or play it regularly.

RATING: 9
After playing Tzaar 12 times, and Yinsh only once or twice, I found myself thinking about Yinsh and not Tzaar (once, I even had to think twice in order to remember how Tzaar worked).  I do have a weak spot for Yinsh.

In fact, I believe that the "freedom" that one feels with Yinsh plays an important role.  Thus, rings can move quite freely (but not too easily), and disc colors are very fluid.  By contrast, in our games of Tzaar, there was not much action: we just had a couple of higher stacks, and most of the game revolved around them.

The fluidity of the disc colors, in Yinsh, puts constant pressure on the players, by creating interesting tactical and strategic puzzles.  The tension is less palpable, in Tzaar, where so many pieces can eat other pieces, for a good part of the game…
it is nice to keep track of all the possible "tense" places on the board (a little like in Schotten Totten, but with the added challenge of an ever changing board situation).

- The game does not look as sexy as the more colorful and varied Hive, for instance, or as the game of Go, with its simple but noble material, and nice stone patterns.

RATING: 10
A two player abstract that has a high fun factor, rather than just being an intellectual exercise (not that I have a problem with 2pa games that are intellectual exercises).I'm not sure that the lack of calculability that some talk about is real, however.  The visualization skills may be a little different than chess or go, but all of the information is there, and, at most, there are only five pieces that can move.In any event, I would say that this is worth at least one try.UPDATE: I've now played a truly absurd amount of this on BSW (over 150 games), and yet there are still huge amounts for me to learn, and I still find myself wanting to understand it better.  It probably helps that I'm among the top 50 players on BSW by Elo.  Regardless, I don't see myself burning out on it anytime soon (ever, really), so I'm bumping my rating up to a full 10.UPDATE: I've now played this FtF several times, and I think it's even better that way. A definite 10.

RATING: 6
This definitely has very sound mechanisms. Like most abstracts the game is easy to learn, difficult to master. I feel here that there is more direction in the objective so new players don't feel totally lost as is the case with most classic abstracts. Also, unlike say Hive there isn't an issue of ties or having a large first player advantage. How the placement of your rings interacts with the pieces on the board also allows for some rather zany possibilities. It also is cool that the game gets harder as you get closer to winning.

However, while this is a very good design, the fun factor wasn't as high for me as it could have been. I mean I'm sure part of that is I am fairly poor at this game and understanding the nuances would make me appreciate it more, but the decisions I do see you can make just don't feel as interesting as other abstracts. How pieces change sides or get added or subtracted to the board is clever, but it feels more like a nebulous mass that you manipulate solely to extract points rather than having the nice feeling of being able to build something as in Go or Tigris, or slowly dwindle your opponent's forces as in the various regional forms of chess.

I love abstracts with a minimal rules footprint and great depth, and Yinsh fits the bill. It only takes a few minutes to learn and teach, but there's a lot going on in every game. The downside to losing rings -- to making progress towards winning -- is a fascinating dynamic.

The pieces look and feel great, too. They're satisfying to handle and the speckles, as well as the seemingly odd third color choice (blue), all come together to make it visually interesting without sacrificing simplicity.

I also dig that it's quick. The board can change rapidly, and a stalemate in one area opens up an opportunity in another. Overall, it's brilliant.

YINSH requires both strong spatial reasoning skills and the ability to anticipate future moves - just like chess. It's strictly a filler game - it plays in a short 15 to 20 minutes - and I can't see myself playing more than two games of YINSH in one evening. Between Lost Cities and YINSH, as of now it's a toss-up.

That said, I enjoy playing it everytime and the challenge it affords.

Like a combination of Othello and omok (five in a row), kinda.

edit: I retract the above. I'm not expert in Othello but the omok similarity begins and ends with making a line of five. Focusing on the discs is a fast way to lose the game. The rings move similarly to cannons in janggi (my favorite piece in any chesslike game), and being mindful of their mobility is key.

Game in a Nutshell: Abstract game where you try to line up five of your color using rings to place new pieces on the board and then moving them to flip, othello-style, what's already been played. 

Two-player only.

Pros: Great game to explain and start playing in under 5 minutes. I think it stretches the idea what non-gamers idea of what a abstract can be. Each move gives you a sense that you're rewriting the game rather then shifting one little piece at a time. The best part of the game is how the leader gets handicapped by removing playable pieces as they get closer to winning, a mechanic that I vote as a simple stroke of genius on the designer's part. All the components look nice and have a great, solid feel. 

Cons: The game-play can feel chaotic and sometimes the most obvious thing goes unseen because of it. That also makes the game one that's difficult to visualize and develop strategies based on an understanding of what's really happening. Each game feels completely different (which could be interpreted as a positive) which makes it hard to expand on what you learn from one game to the next; thus giving little intensive to play repeatedly.

Other: I put this a hair above GIPF (the only other game I've played from the series) because of how much more freedom you have to move around the board and effect things quickly.

Best Use: When you want something fast, interesting, and don't mind the straight-forwardness of an abstract.

I always liked something about Othello, but found the strategy limited, and it was annoying to physically flip dozens of pieces and carefully check for any other pieces that need to be flipped.

Yinsh has an Othello feel with the flipping of markers, but that is where the similarity ends. Although I'm only a beginner at the game, I'm sure there is plenty of strategic and tactical depth here - as evidenced by the excellent players online. Also unlike Othello, only one line of markers needs to be flipped at a time.

The pieces have a nice look and feel to them, and the board is nicely understated. The rules are simple, although the rulebook could have been worded more carefully.

Yinsh feels timeless. One of the best two-player games I have played.

This game is impressively deep for something that can be explained in a few minutes. After 10 or so plays I'm still dealing with the interesting board shape and learning the patterns that lead to successful attacks. I get the feeling I'll get years of enjoyment out of this game.

A very enjoyable and thoughtful abstract with clever mechanisms that, unlike Chess, didn't make my brain hurt.  There are great tactical decisions to make and a mixture of defensive & offensive strategies.  The game can swing quickly since markers can flip over (change colour).  Placement is interesting because markers are left "behind" (where your ring was previously) when you move.  Love the leveling mechanism where each time you score you lose one of your 5 rings (which are the pieces you move and use to place markers).

This game is like Checkers meets Go meets Connect-4. 

I love abstract games. This one was not a let down.

Unique pieces and strategy can definitely become immersible.

My only complaints so far is honestly the quality of the board. but the Price point is just about right, otherwise.

I've gone back and forth quite a bit on Yinsh. [gameid=528] was my first game in the Gipf Project, and it is still my favorite. [gameid=2346] came next, and I've also played it the second most, albeit with much less success. I've played Yinsh not nearly enough, but I think it is going to end up a notch behind Dvonn. While Dvonn's placement phase is longer and more opaque, it clearly has a significant impact on the game. Not that ring placement is not important in Yinsh, but I just find myself paying attention to the opponent less. And, maybe I need to change that, but I think Yinsh just feels a little more chaotic than I'd like.

I do love the making-progress-towards-your-objective-makes-it-harder-to-make-progress-towards-your-objective rule; it's nice to see similar rules in games like [gameid=7805]. And there is an element of "don't set up anything too good, lest your opponent use it against you" that I love so much in Zertz.

All of which makes Yinsh very good, just not my first choice.

Very clever game; making a row gets you closer to winning, but loses you a ring - which reduces your influence on the board.  An excellent balancing act, and clever that the rings also track your score.  This is more closely related to GIPF than any of the other games in the series (line removal, getting closer to victory loses you influence), while having very different mechanisms.

Yinsh is one of the better Gipf games with Zèrtz and Dvonn. It's easier than Zèrtz - well, easier to figure out, not necessarily easier to play well. The jumping rings make Yinsh fun to play. The strategy seems complex first, but second game should already go better.

Would play it, but don't really like it.

You choose a ring of your color and put a piece with your color on that point and move the ring in any direction (cannot go over another ring and must stop at first available spot), flipping over all pieces that were jumped.

Longer playing than Tzaar, but the finer game, I think.  It shares an economical ruleset, gorgeous components and the possibility of developing into something rich and strange.  The blitz game is fine, but a bit of a cop out, as it undermines one of the game's greatest strengths, which is the way that scoring is the same as becoming weaker.  I hope to play this much more, but I can see why it is the top rated abstract.

À mon goût, YINSH est le plus intéressant, le plus plaisant des jeux du projet GIPF à jouer, et le plus accessible.

L'erreur semble moins fatale que dans les autres jeux, car le joueur qui mène la partie (en termes d'anneaux capturés) est également celui qui dans les faits est le plus vulnérable sur le plateau.

YINSH mérite sa place au haut des meilleurs jeux abstraits.

The fourth game from the GIPF series. Using a board similar to GIPF, each player has 5 rings. The Othello like disks are black and white. If you have five of your color in a row, remove the five disks and a ring. First player to reomve three rings win. Turn sequence is play your color disk inside your own ring, then move your ring; the rings allow you to jump over consecutive disks, changing their color. Pretty good game.

If my experience with abstracts like The Duke, Go, Chess, and Abalone have taught me anything, its that I'd probably go for abstracts with more theme/high quality/portability than anything else. That's why I think I like Splendor so much more than any other abstract ish game, so I think I'd hesitate on Yinsh.

I also want more abstracts that play >2P. For example, 4P The Duke would be epic as well as the GIPF series in multiplayer.

EDIT: Played a minimal version of Yinsh, and it confirmed my thoughts: I'd prefer a version with more players/at least some theme pasted over. I like that abstracts are simple and relatively fun, but it feels like just a long slog til the endgame. I prefer euro games with more paths to victory and not so much an absolute board.

[b]Length: 3/5[/b]  This game doesn't always take a long time, but when it does... oh boy. The problem with this game is it has a ridiculous amount of possibilities. Early on, when the board is still relatively barren, your moves will probably be pretty easy to figure out. But as time goes on, and discs are placed to block each other, and there are constant areas that would give your opponent an easy five in a row if you move over some discs, you'll start realizing that this game gets stressful. I like the stress this game provides, but I'll admit, occasionally it takes too long for the game to finish, and that stress will no longer be enjoyable. The game will still be fun in those circumstances, but more because it's testing you to the very fiber of your being. I've had games of this where I was shaking by the end of it, and I'm not one to take victory or a loss in a game super seriously.

[b]Outplay potential: 4/5 [/b] This is the most important factor when rating abstracts, in my opinion. The outplay potential here is very large. In fact, I think it's a harder game to master than any other in the GIPF series. With that said, even the game itself tells you that a significant portion of it is attempting to find order in the chaos. Coming up with long term strategies can be difficult to impossible in this game. You generally want to set things up so that your opponent either can't do something, or doesn't want to. This isn't always possible, though. Many abstracts let you force your opponent into a corner, like Tzaar, Chess, or Hive. This one does let you block opponent's pieces, but a lot of times it's at the use of two of your pieces. Cornering doesn't really do much for you in this game, and for that reason, it can be incredibly difficult to figure out a way to force your opponent to move how you want them to.

[b]Rules: 5/5[/b] I think this game is the deepest of the GIPF series, but it's also the easiest to teach. People grasp the strategy of getting five discs in a row much easier than they do capturing stacks in DVONN or eliminating all of a type of piece in TZAAR. You'll probably find that this game is the easiest to get to the table, because from the very beginning, the objective is clear. You have enough opportunities to block opponents so it doesn't feel like you can constantly be thwarted if you play well. The game gives rules that benefit and penalize both players depending on what they want to do. It works well in making your decisions matter both in completing the objective, but also making sure you don't assist your opponent in doing the same.

[b]Longevity: 5/5 [/b] Every time I play this game, I feel like I'm much better than I was the play before. Despite this, I still feel like I'm very mediocre at it. This is not one of those games that you master within a few plays. It can take several to a countless amount of plays before you really start figuring out all of the meat to the game, and even after you figure it out, it doens't necessarily mean you'll win every time. It's still difficult to put what you learn into actions sometimes, because of the chaotic potion of the game.

[i][COLOR=#33CCFF]Final thoughts:[/COLOR] The lower rated entries on my review aren't always problems, but they have potential to be problems on every play. Despite this, I think the game is incredible. It makes me feel exactly how i want to feel when playing an abstract: challenged and desperate. I actually like the feeling I have when I can swear I'm on the path to a loss, but then I see a potential victory that I can achieve in two or three turns as long as my opponent just doesn't see it coming. It really is spectacular, and the talk around this game isn't overhype. If you have any interest in the game, knowing that it's a 5 in a row game, you really need to get your hands on it.[/i]

I have to be "in the mood" to play YINSH, but when I am nothing else will fit.  A weird mashup of Pente, Othello, and Chinese Checkers, it's a solid 2-player abstract that pulls a fantastically designed solution to the runaway leader problem by making it progressively more difficult for the players to complete their goals.  It's addictively clever and one game usually begets another.

Most easily described as one third Go-moku, one third Reversi and one third nitroglycerin, Yinsh seems at first a bit difficult to control (in spite of using known mechanisms!). Luckily, restraining the movement ability of the player ahead keeps newcomers away from hopelessness if they're already trailing after a couple of moves... anyway, at some point (and not too late, for that matter) the game becomes manageable all at once. 

Not being as immediately seductive as Zèrtz or Dvonn, Yinsh shows the same replayability - after getting a feel for it, there is a mad mighty game for a whole life...

[b]YINSH[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]YINSH is the second GIPF game I've played; I learned LYNGK earlier this month. Similar to LYNGK, Kris Burm has managed to create a deep, strategic game play experience based on a very simple and intuitive set of rules. I found YINSH to be slightly more straight forward than LYNGK [i](which is my favorite of the two because the game opens without you being a specific set of colors)[/i]. I would recommend either game to folks, who like me, have written off abstracts. This series of games has made me rethink my thoughts on abstracts and I really think the kind of thinking you engage in while playing these games is great for kids. 

I've found that trying to write about an abstract is tough unless you want to give a rules breakdown [i](which I'm not interested in doing)[/i], the best thing I can say is that so far the GIPF games have managed to create a really compelling decision space to explore; add to that the excellent components and the GIPF games rise above the other abstracts I've played. I'm excited to check out the other games in the GIPF series since I have a new found respect for abstract games. I've already bought LYNGK and depending on how much my family enjoys playing that, I may end up getting a copy of YINSH too.[/i]

Wow! What a brain burner. This is by far the easiest game when it comes to mechanics. Just pull it out of the box and play. But with pieces flipping all over the place, this isn't an easy one to master.

This abstract is a little harder to think through than Tzaar, because you have to really think ahead on each of your turns.  The twist in the game is that the leading player loses a playing piece as they get closer to winning. This weakens the leader significantly.

One of the better games in the series (with Zertz and Tzaar). The board fills quickly, and then you're constantly developing threats and countering threats. The mechanism of restricting the leader's options by reducing the rings is an excellent one and has often led to turnabout when someone has gone too hard too quickly and not left themselves a next avenue of attack. Thumbs up.

My second favorite of the series after Gipf. This one is very accessible as the game mechanics and board are easy to see and the explanation basically gives you the strategy in a straight forward way. However there is a learning curve but much shorter than some of the others. Can be played by beginners and pros alike.

RATING: 8
A good abstract you can sink your teeth into.  There is plenty of room for clever play and combinations.  If the game were to stretch beyond 45 minutes or so, it may get a bit bland staring at the board, but that doesn't seem to happen too often.  The gameplay is quite dynamic and the condition that you get weaker as you approach victory is pure genius.  TZAAR, the only other game in the GIPF series I have played, is a bit better though.

TRY Mar/04 (BSW): very neat game, partially like Othello/Reversi, but trying to make 5-in-a-row like Sequence.  However, you need your groups of 5 to happen 3 times, before your opponent, and it gets tougher for each group you make!

Another abstract GIPF brainkiller. As all GIPF games, this one has really working mechanics. You place a disc and move your ring. Simple and quickly explained. What is not simple is considering the consequences. 
You have more control over your moves than in many other GIPF games but the complexity of seeing forward is still as hard as in any other GIPF game.

YINSH is definitely one of the best GIPFs, it's just not the best.

In tight competition with TZAAR as my favorite of the series. Learning to use the rings to block the opponent's rings, break up opposing rows, and threaten to complete one's own rows has made the game very interesting. Unlike DVONN, where I still don't really see how to approach the early and mid-games, YINSH has a pretty straight-forward connection between victory condition and mechanics.

This is a great game!  Easy to get ready, start with an empty board.  The turned-based setup phase is only 5 moves, so the game proper is only about 2 minutes from opening the box.

First to take 3 rings off the board wins.  But each ring that comes off makes the game harder so getting ahead weakens you.  This is unlike Chess or Gipf, which can be a frustrating slow death for the loser.

My wife and I have been playing and in one game she came back from 2 rings down (the most you can be behind) to tie it.  That means until the win, it's anyone's game.

Just awesome.

Abstracts are really not my thing. I grabbed this in a math trade out of curiosity about it's high rating. I got to play this one afternoon with the wife. She found it frustrating as the tiles flipped back and forth from her color to mine and back again as our pieces jumped around the board, but ultimately she had fun and would play it again. In our game, I won, but only by accident as I didn't realize I had won until I was done resolving a move meant to set me up for a different move later.

Yinsh is a brilliant combination of simple, easy to explain rules.  It's definitely got that "let's play again" factor down.  The handicapping as the game goes on helps make it an interesting finish every time, and it also introduces another interesting decision to make - when an opponent can't interfere with your 5 in a row setup, should you keep it on the board as long as possible?

Geez, how does Kris Burm do it?  This is in my opinion the nearly perfect abstract game.  The beginning can be different for every game yet is quickly over unlike Dvonn.  Although I love Gipf also, it can be a little chaotic due to the amount of change on the board that can come from your opponent's move.  Yinsh doesn't suffer from this.  Yet it does have enough uncertainty to not suffer from analysis like Zertz can.  I really like its perfect blend of defense and offense.  This is my wife's favorite of the series.  I don't have Tamsk.

RATING: 5
Beautiful game and very elegant design and rules. I love the clanking of the chips and the minimalistic colors. The gameplay is easy to learn and has a nice twist to it. The goal is to get 3 of your rings off the board. You get a ring out by having 5 of your colors in a row. The curve is that as you get a ring out, you essentially get weaker as you have less options on a turn. That means a player who is ahead is actually at a disadvantage over someone who is behind. That was probably what made me buy the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Sometimes I am good at abstracts.  I’m good at the kind of abstracts that require you to survive a ton of player created chaos.  I only have a chance at winning an abstract if it allows me to confuse and perplex my opponent.  In Yinsh, trying to play chaotically will get you into trouble.  Your opponent will easily fool you if you don’t pay attention. I don’t pay attention, and therefore, I am as terrible at Yinsh. That said, I enjoy it. It's fun to know you are being outsmarted. I would imagine that it's also fun to outsmart your opponent. I'm just not able to outsmart anyone.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
People who like games but don't like abstract games tend to cite 'dryness' as the main reason.  The rules of yinsh are certainly dry, but when you play, all you can think is, "juicy!"  The closest analogy I can make is that it makes you feel like you're playing connect 4 for the first time as a kid, and are amazed the way you plunk pieces into the columns.  Similarly, yinsh has a lot of 'flying', as pieces go all over the place.  and yet there is enough order in all of it to make it strategically and tactically interesting.  the most amazing thing about the game is that, even though it's a game without any hidden information or luck, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to read more than 2 moves ahead.  this is a good thing, oddly.  it makes me feel like i'm a kid playing 5 straight or some similar game, happily plugging along, without the slow ponderousness that accompanies more mature games, where you can think through many moves in advance.  but that could just be inexperience talking.  Update:  After many more plays, I can't see myself ever tiring of the game.  Fun and thoughtful, exciting, dramatic, and easy to find opponents for, because it makes such a good first impression.  Bumping up from 9 to 10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Gaming love at first sight. I cannot expand much more on the praise of others without sounding redundant. What YINSH it lacks in depth (though not in short supply) it makes up for in the ever-present strategy. A single move of a ring is magnificently influential: blocking, capturing, threatening, sniping, from innummerable positions on the board. Everything from the initial placement, the subtle approaches and retreats, the subterfuge, the catch-up mechanisms, and the capturing system, all culminate into brilliant abstract game design. 

(+) Impressive implementation of simple rules leading to a wide array of strategic decisions.
(+) Dynamic gameplay.
(+) Beautiful aesthetics and satisfying, tactile feel.

(-) A bit -too- simple, but refreshingly so.
(-) Perhaps just a tad overproduced.
(-) Lacking in theme. No metaphors of war. No overtones of life and death. This does not sit well with ~many~ a gamer, so I suppose it hinders its appeal. This actually doesn't bother me in the slightest, but attempting to fault this game leaves me grasping at straws.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The pleasing is the management of chaos. Many people think this game is wild and unpredictable, but many of them are still playing the beginner's game (a big clump of ever-flipping pieces in the middle) instead of trying to control the game with openings in the corners and sides.

It's a perfect information, pure abstract game which just reinforces why I have a hard time warming up to them. One just has to analyze the decision tree and then make a move, and I don't really find great joy in doing that too often. I prefer games to be more social, with interaction, and chit-chat. Hard to do here when folks are thinking while playing.  And finally, this game is just too long for what it is - so rating knocked down 1 compared to other titles in the GIPF series that I have played.

I was always intrigued by this game for some reason. It's in project GIPF.

Elegant and simple to learn, even the newest players can participate and get somewhere. Handicapping a player is ridiculously easy to accomplish and doesn't require any weird rules.

Far and away, the most redeeming feature of the game is that the process of winning allows the other player to catch up! Games should always be close, but not arbitrary. It's a fine line, and this game nails it. If only chess were this good. . . .

I feel like I should like this one more than I do.  I simply can't read ahead very well in it.  Besides, Dvonn has the prettiest pieces of all the Gipf games.

I can't say enough good things about all Kris Burm's board games: Gipf, Dvonn, Yinsh, Punct, Tzaar, and Zertz. Even my 9-year-olds are really into them, and each one challenges your brain to come up with unique strategies for winning. They're brilliant in their simplicities!

RATING: 7.5
Very nice abstract using hollow rings and two-sided round pieces (white on one side, black on the other). Two players take turns placing a set of rings in their color (black or white). Then players take turns moving rings of their color. Before moving a ring, the ring is filled in with a piece of their color. A player may move the ring in a straight line and may stop on an empty space. They must stop at the edge of the board or if at the next available empty space once they jump over pieces. They then flip over ALL jumped pieces. When a player gets five in a row, they remove the five from the board, and move one of their rings (any ring of theirs) to the scoring track. First player to score three rings wins. I generally don't go gaga for abstracts, but I really enjoyed this one.

Dec-2008: Yay, I got this for Christmas! Thanks, Matt!

Aug-1-2009: I convinced Melissa to play this. She haaaaaaaaaated it. It's not that it's abstract (although any game with you can lose the game in the first few moves is a big turn off for her), but something about the dots and the intersections and the field of geometric shapes just made her lose concentration.

It initially seemed to me that this abstract is a little busy, with shades of Gomoku, Checkers and Othello, but it works. There are a lot of possibilities, sometimes too many, and there are many opportunities to sneak up on your opponent through the backdoor.

What I dislike about this game is that it starts out too slowly, as you have to place rings, edge-abuse, counter edge-abuse, abuse some more, before the game finally gets interesting. Very tough decisions and spatial decisions abound in the mid-game, but it almost takes too much effort to get there.

Yet another result of my abstract strategy addiction.  I still prefer Dvonn in this series.

RATING: 6.5
Played once. YINSH is based on some great concepts. Players move rings of their colour across a grid, leaving behind a disc of their colour and flipping any discs in the path of which the ring travels. The objective is to get 5 discs of your own colour in a row three times, with the catch that the number of rings you have available to you decreases with every successful row of 5 you achieve. 

The ruleset is simple, but the tactical opportunities are great. Players need to consider achieving their own goals while disrupting their opponents, and every move has considerable implications. However, my rating reflects the fact that I'm not a huge fan of abstracts and can't imagine myself asking to play this too often.

Not as pretty as Zertz or Dvonn but it does play well; players are trying to get five pieces in a row, but each time they do so, they lose one of the 5 rings used to place and turn over pieces on the board. It's a nice balance of trying to force your opponent to do work for you and trying to score at the best possible moment.

I'm not a huge fan but it's a solid little game.

YINSH is one of the only abstracts I really want to play. Elements of Pente and Othello, but far superior to either of those titles. I have more luck getting others to play this than Go, but I'm not complaining. They are both exciting and interesting abstracts. I appreciate that the game rules include a "blitz" game variant which plays very fast. It's great for kids, and great for teaching the game.

Elvileg a legmagasabbra értékelt játék a GIPF projekten belül, nekem viszont a TZAAR jobban tetszett. Ez sima amőba azzal megspékelve, hogy 5 körrel kezdünk, amikre helyezhetjük a pontjainkat, majd bármennyi letett pontot átugorva megváltoztathatjuk azok színét. 3 ötöst kell kirakni a saját színünkből a nyeréshez, minden ötös után egy rakó karikánk lekerül ezzel talán némi kompenzációt adva. Nem rossz játék egyáltalán, nagyon szép a kivitele, de nem igazán az én stílusom az ilyenfajta logikai játék.

This seems to be the most accessible of the GIPF games, and it is the first one that I learned, although I hope to try DVONN sometime.  I found it readily accessible and a fun twist on Othello, as you lose some power the closer that you get to winning.

YINSH is most similar to GIPF in the series, but quicker, more tactical, and more difficult to visualize. I love how the victory condition requires you to remove your rings from the board, thereby diminishing your options and weakening your position, but not so much that a losing player walks comfortably back into contention. YINSH is up there with DVONN, easily among my favourites in the series. It's also, in my experience, the most accessible. Because it's shorter than but as satisfying as GIPF, I think it's also better.

Great abstract game. I'm genereally not much into two-player abstracts and disliked games like chess. Despite that, I really like the various games of the Gipf-series. They are as two-player abstracts should be: simple and clear rules, full of tactics and action (or deep thinking if you prefer that). Yinsh may be my favourite. It rewards forward thinking, but grabbing opportunities as well. The catch-up mechanism is very clever.

Somewhat reminiscent of Reversi in that there are discs that flip between black and white, but discs are flipped by jumping with ring pieces, which can also block the opponent's jumps. The win condition is to get five discs of your colour in a row, three times, removing the discs and one of your rings each time. This is a much more dynamic game than Reversi.

I don't have many opportunities to play two player abstracts but YINSH is a strong contender when I do. Lovely bakelite pieces, with real heft.

RATING: 7.5
[RGG 2003 edition] {GIPF, Abstract; othello-variant} YINSH is a wondrous abstract game of modern age. It should be included in the hall of fame of abstract games. YINSH is a wonderful integration of Connect 4, Chinese Checker and Othello. It's deep and unforgiving. Like all good abstract games, the rules are simple but it takes a long time to master the game. Thus, it is of high replay value.

There are some innovative mechanics, at least for me. Firstly, leading players are handicapped because he has fewer rings to use. Secondly, in most other games, pieces belong to a particular user; in YINSH, only rings have owner and markers are quite neutral. Therefore, a player may assist his opponent if he placed markers carelessly.

If you have to pick only one from GIPF series, it's the one. (Well, if you like abstract strategy games, you should collect all games in GIPF project.)

I love the Gipf games, but they are rated 6 because sadly they don't hit the table often. I have to be in the mood for them and being themeless makes it a bit harder. Other 2p games seem to be pulled out before it since my husband prefers non-abstracts (or abstracts under 15 min).

My favourite abstract. It's fun, just the right length, complexity, and range of tactical/strategic options. I reckon this would be good for any  couple, regardless of your usual fellings about abstracts. And the one game I can use to lure my teenage son out of his bedroom with, even if he does grumble.

RATING: 9.5
Wonderful game.  Simple rules make it easy enough to teach to just about anyone in about 5 minutes, and the game itself is deep enough to keep two players busy for some good, long play sessions.  The game is brilliantly balanced, since scoring points requires the player to put him/herself at a tactical disadvantage by removing the piece they scroed with. Takes elements from many classic games and blends them perfectly.

For a fairly brain-burning abstract, Yinsh is both accessible and fun.  That sounds like a contradiciton, but somehow Yinsh manages to pull it off.  Each game has a different feel due to the starting positions of the rings, which adds to the already high replayability.  Great game.

I really like this game, but I give the edge to TZAAR and DVONN because they're shorter.  A game of YINSH always seems to take about an hour, and I can play the other ones in 15-20 minutes.  It's a satisfying experience when I do sit down to play this one, it's just that that doesn't happen all that often.

I think this one is liked better than DVONN because it's a little more reminiscent of games people have heard of before.  I think this game is a bit of a cross between Othello (which I don't like) and Go-Moku (which I do), and I have a great time thinking out my moves each time I play.

Click, click, click. I just love moving those pieces around! So solid, so smooth, so cool to the touch. I feel like royalty when I play. The gameplay itself is also very enjoyable. Yinsh is the most low-brow of the Gipf games, in my opinion. You can set up a move or two moves ahead at the most as the board is so fluid. This keeps you from having to spend long minutes in fretful contemplation. Identify a likely spot on the board and then make your move, unless your opponent seems to have a nice thing going somewhere, in which case plop a piece down and try to mess it up. The shining charm of Yinsh is that it's just plain fun to drop and flip, drop and flip, and watch the colors turn. If you somehow manage to win as a result, all the better!

I like how the board seems to drastically change from turn to turn when the rows of disks get flipped.  It's hard for me to think about offense and defense more than 1 or 2 turns ahead.  Although removing a ring does have an effect on the game and puts the leader at a bit of a disadvantage, it's not as drastic as I imagined it would be before playing.

The accessibility to normal everyday folks(i.e. the people who don't visit this page everyday) is remarkable.  Definite plus.  Can easily see myself playing this 20 years from now.   It has depth with elegance.  Short rule set.  It feels "classic", yet remains dynamic.  I just prefer my 2 player games to have luck, instead of chaos.  Still very very good.  In spite of my experience with the game,  I can still play with new players.  I think thats more of a function of me totally missing the point, more than a function of the game.  However, this makes the game a great addition to my collection.

This game collides with my game srategizing.  I have 50 plays of this game and I frequently lose to new players.  I'm not sure why I am awful but it does not detract from my enjoyment of the game.  It probably adds to my enjoyment because I can still bring it off the shelf instead of finding a player with similar experience.

This is currently my favorite abstract game.  After playing YINSH seven times on BSW, I've found it to be incredibly simple, yet incredibly deep.  I recently purchased it based on how much I've enjoyed playing it online.  I have yet to try any other games in the GIPF series, but after discovering how great this one is, I'm looking forward to checking out the others -- UPDATE: I finally tried DVONN a couple times and did enjoy it, but not nearly as much as YINSH.

About [thing=7854][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=7854][/thing] is a member of the [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/10/gipf-project]GIPF family[/url]. In it you are a dog walker, and the goal is to put your three dogs (probably Vizslas, or Xiasi) in the dog house, and you do this when your dog pees in a row of 5 bushes. However, the other player's dog will also want to mark their territories in rows of 5 bushes, and sometimes one will come and pee in a bush one of your dogs peed, changing the bush to its color. The twist is that, once a dog has marked its territory, you guard it in the dog house, making harder for the remaining 2 dogs (or single dog, when two have already done their business) to fight for peeing in the bushes.

It is a neat. However, some do consider [thing=7854][/thing] more like an abstract game about rings (and not collars) and markers (instead of peed bushes). Still, the core of the game remains the same.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
You move the collars in order to leave peed bushes markers behind in the spot that the dog moved from. If the dog passes by bushes peed by the dogs of the other player, it will pee in those, turning them to its territory (color), but if it passes by bushes of its own, the dog will scratch on the leaves and will dig the ground, making its mark mostly leave, meaning that the ownership of the bush will pass to the other side. Dogs are weird like this.

Dogs can can pass for several bushes at once, but they must be in unbroken row. Also, a dog can pass over another dog, and must stop, and can't stop in a bush, only in plain grass, so players normally try to block the other while leaving open rows for them.

When a player makes a row of 5 peed bushes, she takes out the five markers and also takes out one of the dogs from play, returning it to the dog house. This will make the territory battle harder for her, but will also mean that she is closer to win now. First person to get three dogs back in the house is the winner.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which dog to move and to where. How best to block the other player, and the best way to leave opportunities for completing rows of 5 peed bushes while denying the same to the opponent.

It seems simple enough, and, considering the rules, it is. Still, the spatial awareness the game demands and the several steps in order to walk around your opponent, tightening the leash, until she has no way to stop you, is hard to master, and I'm being crushed constantly.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Zero luck - all the dogs are taught well and do what is expected of them;
- Great rules vs depth ratio;
- [thing=7854][/thing] can be explained in around 2 minutes, if that much;
- The bits are very well done - the board is meh, but the pieces are great;
- Plays quick enough, but isn't a filler;
- A very smart catch-up mechanism - once a dog "scores", is goes out of play, making harder to score again;
- An unique theme.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- No minis for the dogs nor dogeeples;
- Some AP can happen, as with most game with no hidden information and no luck;
- Only a 2 players game;
- Bast is not pleased by it nor cat persons.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in a battle of wits. Every move must count and there is little room for mistakes. Have a good chunk of spatial awareness and being able to predict (or corral the options) the movements of the opponent can be key to win.

[thing=7854][/thing] works well for what is intended to do. But the theme is too thin and 2 players game aren't my thing, and when I do play one, I prefer them dripping with theme, like [thing=36932][/thing], [thing=45986][/thing] and [thing=115746][/thing], or just playing a cooperative game in two. Still, [thing=7854][/thing] is a very good option in its field.

Othello wishes it could be YINSH! I love the lookahead, the planning, the blocking, the multiple uses of rings as launchpoints and blockers, the diminishing power over time... so good! I've only played a little bit in person so far but several times online, and it's an exhilarating experience.

The board WON'T STOP CHANGING!!  This little mindfuck is like a good hoagie: delicious, difficult, and different with every bite.  The relentless speed with which the board radically changes is unlike any other abstract I know.  Sure, a good move in chess can make you shift tactics, but a good move in YINSH can make you abandon your until-then-pretty-successful strategy in favour of an entirely new one.

This game is flippin' AMAZING! (pun intended). Very clever mix of Checkers, Connect Four, and Othello, three not too good games which combine into one of my favorite games of all time. The balancing mechanism is brilliant and makes an awesome game even more spectacular. I really like how the rings control the playing field and can drastically change the game, but there are many opportunities for blocking, as well as tactical play (too dynamic for perfecting a long term strategy). The fact that it only takes half an hour makes this the perfect game for any occasion when players are up for a head-to-head battle of wits, strategy, and tactics. And for me, that's pretty much any time.

The only game I've played from the Gipf series, and I can't say that it was exactly stunning.  It has some interesting mechanics, but as somebody who usually prefers a nice, meaty theme, it wasn't really my cup of tea.  As far as abstracts go, it seems to fall prey to the "I'm not so great now, but just try me about 30 more times and I will REALLY shine."  The question is, is it really worth playing it 29 more times to appreciate it?  Perhaps we should just play [gameid=2655] or [gameid=171] again...

Somewhat reminiscent of Othello (or Reversi) in the flipping mechanic.  A fun addition to the Gipf line but not quite as good as Dvonn or regular Gipf.

Uno de los mejores juegos abstractos que tengo. Ligero y corto (se juega en unos 20 minutos) pero al mismo tiempo intenso y entretenido

My favourite of the GIPF series I've played. Really like how the closer you are to winning, the harder it becomes. Strategy is of utmost importance in this game. Mistakes made are unforgiving.

I think Yinsh has been the most successful game in the series because it is the most accessible, and it scales well from players who want to take it lightly to those who want to think deeply about every move. I like how one tries to set up complex situations that account for the various responses an opponent might have, and also how simply an intuitive sense of board position will yield sometimes unexpected positive results. A true classic.

RATING: N/A
The players each start with 5 rings on the board. Every time a ring is moved, it leaves a marker behind. Markers are white on one side and black on the other. When markers are jumped over by a ring they must be flipped, so their color is constantly changing. The players must try to form a row of 5 markers with their own color face up. If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove 3 of his rings wins the game. In other words, each row you make brings you closer to victory-but also makes you weaker, because you have one fewer ring to play with. Very tricky!

It's embarrassing to lose against an opponent named "Dumbot," and even more so to get my ass handed back to me at the end of the game.  Luckily, it's easy to learn some of the strategy of the game this way.  My first face-to-face game took about 90 minutes, and even though the both of us were taking a long time to analyze the board and place a piece, I never felt un-engaged with the game.  I like the attention paid to the design, what with the edges being no longer than 4 spaces, and the balancing mechanism of removing a ring from the board when you score a chain, which then makes it more difficult for you to score another one.  Very good.  Very impressive.

Until now, this is the only game in the GIPF series that I have played – but what a game! I really like this simple-to-learn, with great depth and strategy abstract game. Every game feels different as the setup varies, and every ‘stage’ of the game, as you removes more and more of your rings, generate new challenges. All in all this makes an exciting game with excellent replay value.

The purest form of game. Seemingly chaotic, but as the game progresses players begin to see a lot of tactical opportunities that emerge with every move.

Played several times on BSW. While not a bad game in its genre, I think it lacks the elegance of other games in the Gipf project. It is probably deeper, though, with more things to take care about when playing - but it may give the feeling than games are more likely to be decided by mistakes rather than by clever play.

A mildly interesting 2-player game where the closer one gets to victory, the more difficult it gets. 

Using rings to leave behind markers of your own colour and flipping over markers in the path of the ring, a player removes a ring after forming a line of 5 markers of his/her colour. Removing 3 rings wins the game.

The trick is to engineer a substantial number of markers of your own colour, whilst blocking out your opponent's rings along the "boundary" of your "territory", before quickly forming the lines, in quick succession if possible, to win the game.

It seems hard to strategise in this game, and is therefore more of a reactionary type of game. Not too interesting from that point of view.

Amazing game. I love the mechanics and am consistently surprised at how many newbies can pick this game up so quickly to give me quite a run for my money! This is also probably the best game to produce the "wow, what is that game? I want to play next!" effect so absent in many abstract games.

I really like two player abstracts and with some experience I could see this pushing into my top three in the genre.  Long term planning is definitely rewarded but you can't ignore the current board state at any time or you could be giving away a point.  I need to play this one more!

Nice abstract strategy game.  Unfortunately, with purely strategic games with a lot of depth for analytical planning of your moves, I just don't care enough to (and perhaps can't) plot 23 turns ahead.  So, such games I play mostly tactically.  Fortunately, Yinsh feels like its strategic depth may still be safe for novice swimmers like me.

5 minutes to setup and explain. Then you are off. Together with The Duke these are my favourite abstracts at the moment. Whereas The Duke has some randomness with the draw of the tiles this has none. Complete, open information. It's easy to get into it and because almost anyone can get a ring it gives a sense of accomplishment even when you lose. I love the components but the new edition box takes up too much space. I went away for the weekend and i easily packed all the components inside a sleeve folder.

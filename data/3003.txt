I never thought a rugby game would work as a game. I still have nightmares about subbuteo rugby, but this is great. Realistic action with a need to use actual tactics to win. Would recommend to anyone interested in the game.

A very good sports game. The rules are well written and gives a good feel of "real life" rugby, and the authors continue to work to further improve they already more than satisfactory work (there is a huge section of new rules on their website). Can be played with just the basic rules (as a funny and fast family game) but once you start using all the new rules its "simulation" value rises steeply to a very satisfactory level. The physical components of the game (counters, board, play aids etc) are good to very good. Fast to learn and reasonaby fast to play, some understanding of rugby is required (but that should be expected!). Very helpfull support by the authors about the rules and *outstanding* sales service (friendly, polite and reliable). I'm not a big fan of sports game (with the exception of the gloriuos AH's Title Bout!) but I'm really *very* satisfied with this game.

Fan of sports games made into boardgames, so it is a winner right there.  Being American, and knowing little about rugby in all it's forms, but being exposed to it somewhat on Fox Soccer Channel, I felt that the game certainly represents the sport well.  Well enough for my knowledge of the rules anyway.  The games have been exciting for sure, and it has been interesting turning on it's head my tactics playing Blood BOwl vs. playing CT.  In BB you PROTECT your ball carrier, in CT you use your ball carrier to ATTACK the opponent players!  Quite fun!

Brilliant game, well thought out. It really is the closest you get to this awesome sport without getting your ribs broken or losing a few teeth. I'm hooked!

I think we did a great job of taking a sport that has a plethora of sporting laws and making it into a boardgame that can be easily played and understood, but while still keeping the feeling that you are playing rugby union.

I am not a rugby fan.  I hate sports and jocks in general.  Yet I like boardgames about sports and video games about Rugby.  This game is easy to learn, fairly easy to play, and very addicting.  Adding the advanced rules is easy and for the most part intuitive.  My boss (who plays and refs rugby) and I have been playing it at lunch and having a great time.  A bit of a pain to acquire if you live in the states, but well worth the effort and incredibly well supported  by the publisher.

This is a hot hot game for me at the moment - getting to buy it in the middle of the Rugby World Cup is going to make me want to play it as I love the game of rugby. The game plays very realistically as you can drive the ball on and on until you are just paces away from a try when your top player will suddenly knock it on. 8 Plays. 3 Wins, 1 Draw 2 Losses. Scores posted 0-0, 17-10, 0-7, 17-14, 14-12(HT), 17-19(FT), 10-7, 7-0.

RATING: 4
Despite amazing production and graphics, the game didn't much grab me. 

I'm not especially familiar with rugby, but I can see the attraction. There's some fun in blatant fouling, figuring how to best use your cards and punch holes through the defense. rugby is way harder than football: no blocking! Generally I find Blood Bowl better fills this niche.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Great rubgy simulation. 
This boardgame is great because of his starting low complexity that can be increased with all development rules to get a high simulation match.
One step higher than other similar games (Blood bowl, amercian football games and rugby ones).
The reason i came back to boardgame world after 20 years.

There is a rugby rule for this game: if you played rugby, you have to appreciate a game about the game. I appreciate the board game, even if you can't quite model the real game.

Lots of fun here, and it really captures the feel of rugby.  The cards keep your opponent guessing but don't overpower the game.  If you score in this one you know you've earned it!

Very good game.  Plays like an exciting sports game.  a little tension and build up, then suddenly someone makes a break.  The drama as they approach the goal-line.  Are they going to score or not! 

I play it with my 8 year old son, who does not watch sport (does play), and he enjoyed it.  Only thing was the full 15 version was a lot of players for him to track.  The forwards / linemen tend to get left behind. I must update these comments after I try out the 7 a side with him.
I dropped the score from a 10 to a 9.5 due to this.

The game is very attractive, but I would prefer pieces to the tokens.  I realize that this would push the price up considerably, but I would be willing to pay.  In fact I am ordering a set of pieces from a third party listed on the CrashTackle site. If not for that and the fact that the price is very reasonable, I would have dropped another half point.

I used to play rugby in high school and was really looking forward to this. There are some really neat ideas here that could form the foundation for a fantastic game. Unfortunately, the rules that come with the game leave too many holes that players can exploit in ways that would NEVER happen in a real rugby game. The updated online rules may address some of these issues. Sadly, if players were simply playing to win, without making a gentleman's agreement to play proper rugby, then they'd basically be playing a game of their own invention, and not a very interesting game at that. I haven't had time to review the online rules, but I hope they fix things up because the fundamental ball-moving mechanic does impressively replicate the balance of chaos and control at the heart of the game without too much randomness. I'm not quite sold on the pressure play cards, either. Rated as published, although I could see the online advanced rules and fixes raising this score higher.

Very good simulation of rugby. If you like this sport, you will love it. In my case, altough I don't enjoy the sport it recreates, I consider it a well done game. Extremely recomendable as a present to rugby lovers, no matter whether they are gamers or not.

Abbreviated review, as I am having trouble submitting anything longer than a few lines and I could go on for hours on this game.  A great game for the rugby enthusiast who armed with the basic game, rules from the games website and their own rugby knowledge can be engrossed for hours.  The designers have provided a robust platform with simple mechanics which can be added to for greater complexity or realism.  By the second game I had added my own rules for rolling mauls, grubber kicks and increased movement for the back row.  Fantastic fun.

Subsequent games I have started adding Star Players (the natural progression of the game)and playing fantasy matches Lions '74 vs the current All Blacks side for example.

If you love rugby, love boardgames and enjoy adding your own touches to games then this is a must.

I would have liked another stat for picking up the ball. As it is passing and kicking and picking up the ball are all the same stat...

No way a prop passes better than a winger!

I didn't know a thing about Rugby when I first looked into this game. I played it a bit on Vassal and had a great time. Only when I did research on the actual sport did I realize that this game truly is the closest one can get to playing rugby without ending up in an ER.

Best rugby game around. I own it for a while, but after reading the rules I thought it was just so-so. I realised I was wrong a few days ago, when giving it a real try. It is indeed a clever design. The basic sequence is simple but subtle (the fact that tackles happen only during offense's turn is the key). The cards prevent the game from bogging down and allow fine combinations. Tense, flowing well, fun, nicely produced, not so long... who wants more ?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Fantastic job implementing a complex sports field level simulation with simple rules and gameplay. (I wish they would do a soccer version).

Clever use of the card mechanic prevents this from breaking down into an optimization/chess match. The longer you go without scoring, the larger your pile of special ability cards that enable you to break through for an exciting score.

This game is part network analysis and part area control. It realistically simulates the tactical reason why you would want to get tackled, and the tackling mechanic is so perfectly suited to the game of rugby, that I don't think this would work for an American-style football game.

This really is a marvelous achievement in game design.

Insanity!  Using the real-time time limit rule (40 minutes per half) means trying to move 15 ruggers in a one-minute turn and should make even the most experienced Blood Bowl coach thank goodness for four minute turns.  Don't play this if you get migraine headaches easily or have a heart condition.

OK - I don't know Rugby but the basic rules were fairly easy to understand.  It was easy to get playing with the right mechanics.  What takes a bit more time is learning how to combine the various players to effectively move the ball around and through the defense.  My first game lasted for 2.5 hours not because we were slow, but because we were having fun moving the ball back and forth...the time just flew.  I can see the depth of the advanced rules and will probably add them with time and experience.  A very nice sports simulation that I expect to enjoy.  (Initial rating based on one game....time will tell if I keep it here or adjust with more play.)

Really enjoyable, and very realistic representation of a game of rugby. 

Last time I played, got tonked in about an hour 18-3 :o( Still fun, though - and I was playing Scotland, so just goes to show how realistic it is :o)

Roll on the revenge match, methsdrinker....

Update on original July 09 comment: New rules have come out for kicking, rucks, ball bounce etc. etc. which make this even better - just phenomenal design! Now got 6 N. Hemisphere and 6 S. Hemisphere teams

When I found out about this game in the early 2000s I was excited about it, but the shipping from South Africa seemed to much to me back then.
Years later I moved to SA and bought it. Unfortunately I have no one to play against :( ... ok, and I don't like board games on the internet.

I'm holding off on rating and commenting on this game until I have given it a fair go. It is a South African game, which really appeals to me, but I don't know much about rugby. I will need to find an opponent willing to put some time into learning this game.

Very good attempt at transposing the game to a tabletop model! The movement of the players can be awkward at times due to the offside rule, but the choice of a hex dampens a little the reach of a given player. Event cards add the right amount of chaos to the game, which could be repetitive quite quickly. The odds of having scrums may have to be reviewed in order to increase their frequency during long games, but the online community has built several add-on rules which can help diversify the experience for seasoned players.

One of the only true sports simulations that allows the user to have say in the action (as opposed to simply picking the players and reading the results off a chart - bluh!)

Great game!

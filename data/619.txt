RATING: 6.5
Surprisingly complicated to learn from the rules = we screwed up our first two hands completely.
But after that the depth started to dawn.  I think this could be a really cool game to play once you start to grasp some of the strategy.

Don't be afraid to Buy the Bottle with cards in the 12-18 range to score many coins, particularly using the higher yellows.  Voiding yellow into the Imp Trick will usually stick you with an unprotected baby yellow.

I'm not normally a fan of trick-taking games but this one won me over on the very first game.  The element of the ever-decreasing target adds such a nice flavour to the game, increasing the difficulty of your decisions.

My family is in to trick taking card games but this one just hasn’t clicked with them. It’s a clever design but it’s a bit tricky to get your head around the strategy. We’ve only played a couple of times and we really need to give it more of a chance, and try to understand the deeper game.  I think I appreciate it more than my family does, probably because I’ve read the good reviews of it here on BGG. It has potential but will it ever be realised? I hope so. Wizard seems to be the trick taking game of choice at the minute.

{3 play, 3 player - initial rating: 7} A nice twist on trick-taking games, and, most surprisingly, a card game that actually has a strong theme! [after a few more plays] I still like it, but I'm not sure there's enough depth here to keep it coming back to the table.

RATING: 7
Interesting trick taking mechanisms that change the game.

#1 Whoever has the imp at the end loses points.  Encourages a slight push your luck mechanism to get as much as you can before dumping trumps

#2 Changing trumps.  The idea that you can remove trumps is fantastic.

#3 Trading cards and putting one in the deck both gives you more information about your opponents and makes the game about imperfect information since you will never know 2 of the cards.

A tricky trick-taking game which takes a little while to figure out, and the problem is that every time I play enough to come up with a little strategy, we then put it away for long enough for me to forget it. Still, a favorite.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
There are hundreds of trick-taking games out there so why should this one garner any attention?  Simply because it combines 2 very good qualities that are rare in trick-taking games.  The first is a press-your-luck element.  This emerges in the form of the bottle imp's trump ability.  You want the imp's power but only up to a point since holding it at the end of the hand will cause you to lose points.  So you press your luck that you can use the imps power but that you can also purge the imp before you get stuck with it.  The second element is that the game plays very well with 3 players.  3 player games can be hard to find and this one stands up nicely as a very good 3 player filler.  A nice card game with a few twists that make it worth owning.

Very nice cards.  An interesting no trump trick taking game.  It takes a while, but you finally figure out that you want to win the bottle rather than throwing high cards in the round.  But you want to win it at a price that enables you to later sell it to someone else for a lower price.

We just played to 250 and that was enough.

Only played three player so far, not sure how much another player would alter game play.
The bottle goes to any player that played lower than the current value, the higher number if more than one card was played lower. Whichever player has the bottle at game end loses the points they've taken, everyone else gains points.

Cool card game. You try to get tricks, but the highest card not always wins the trick. Whoever plays the highest card but lower than the "bottle card" wins the trick, but must also take the bottle. In the end whoever has the bottle loses points, so getting the bottle is an easy way to get points, but later in the game you have to get rid of it, otherwise you lose points. Very tricky. The art work is so so... 3p to 4p only.

RATING: 6
An interesting trick-taking game that definitely breaks from the norm.  It's a little counter-intuitive, not in the mechanisms, but in the strategy.  I think that's the games biggest downfall.   It is so difficult to grasp the strategy that new players will struggle to understand what the best thing is to do.  And, as a result, they won't want to stick around and delve into the game, learning more of the strategies as they go.  I have to give credit to this game, because it is amazingly simple to teach, but that really doesn't seem to help the situation.

Case in point:  I have played twice now, and I just feel like the game is riddled with luck (more than most trick-taking games.)  However, I suspect this is because I'm not grasping what I should do with my cards.  I can see the advantage of counting cards, and knowing when people will or won't follow suit.  I just can't figure out when it's the right time to play some of the lower cards.  As a result, it feels uninteresting and lucky, so I find myself not wanting to try it again to learn the strategy.  Not to mention playing to 500 points as suggested in the rules seems ridiculously long.  I hate when games aren't clear about when the game ends.  "Some prearranged number of hands or points" is WAY too vague for my taste.

A unique and unusual trick taking game that explains easy and has food for thought. Although trick taking games are usually not my thing, the tension brought by trying to get rid of the bottle towards the end of the game made it a winner in my book.
 
 If you get stuck with the bottle at the end of the hand, you take negative points. Devilishly delicious...

One play.

Very favourable first impression - played over lunch hour with my evil, evil co-workers and had a groaningly good time. I gave up on trying to explain the rules after 2 aborted attempts and said "let's just play a hand" - and it worked out just fine. I'm looking forward to playing this again.

We got this because my wife and I like trick taking games.  This game has some neat stuff going for it, but I just think it is not fun to play.  The guy stuck with the bottle getting NO points means that you might as well not keep score unless your going to play a number of rounds of this.

RATING: 8
A very clever whist variant with a push-your-luck type mechanism that punishes those who try too hard for the big score. I have only played a handful of times but it seems to work with gamers and non-gamers alike and it certainly pushes all my whist buttons.

For people who have only played with a standard deck before, the numbering and the ever varying trumps (everything lower than the bottle value - which keeps dropping) can be confusing, but after a couple of hands they usually get the hang.

Interesting trick taking game where the person with the bottle will end up getting negative points, where as all the other players score the tricks they won.  If you are into trick taking games at all, this one is definitely worth a shot!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Many trick-taking games try to be more difficult by having many more cards than a standard deck, so it is more complex and harder to predict.  The Bottle Imp is the reverse, there are fewer cards and the challenge is in getting rid of the ones you don't want.

In practice, this doesn't work as well as I would like.  Some cards are just plain bad, it doesn't just depend on the situation, they're bad, period -- and either it's very difficult to use those cards, or impossible.  There isn't enough variability to allow for flexibility; you're going to get some cards that are horrible and whether you survive or not doesn't have much to do with your skill.

Well, I still like it.  I love that it comes with the short story, and that's a wonderful read.  It's an interesting change of pace but not my first choice for trick-taking.  Maybe it will improve with more plays.

Weird trick-taking game.  Moderate learning curve.  An unlucky hand of cards can be hard to overcome sometimes... but some mitigation is possible since you get to give cards to your neighbors & the bottle.  Trick-taking is not my favorite genre so I don't need a copy in my collection.  Playing to 500 points is too long, go with 200 instead.

I really wanted to like this game.  While I understanmd the mechanism for the game, it just really did not generate the "excitement" element that should have been there.  We went over the rules many times to see if we were missing something, but no, we understood every aspect completely.  We gave it a number of chances, but each time all 3 of us (serious, regular gamers) had exactly the same thoughts and concerns regarding the game.  The theme is good, but the 'wow' factor is missing.

A decent trick taking game with some interesting mechanics. I like how trump changes from hand to hand, and love how the theme is cleverly integrated into the game. As a longtime player of Euchre, Five Hundred, Spades, etc. I ultimately think it feels too much like a traditional card game, so I'm unlikely to want to play this very often.

The first time I played I was lost; didn't get it at all but since then I came across the original short story - thanks to Joe Huber's great review (see http://www.thegamesjournal.com/reviews/Flaschenteufel.shtml ) and the rules then made perfect sense. And it's a bit different game from most, with some nice twists to the tale - recommended.

While the artwork is truly ugly - the second edition's is much prettier - it somehow remains hideously attractive!

Terrific little trick-taking game. I'm not a trick-taking guy generally, but I think I love this one just because a) it's so unique and unusual, b) there is tremendous tension as the clock ticks down in unpredictable ways and everyone is trying to get rid of the bottle, and c) it's got great theme for a card game, usually a huge sticking point and why I'm not a huge fan of them. You want to use the power of the bottle while you have it (i.e., by using your trump cards), but make sure you don't end up with it. It helps that there are little excerpts from the short story on the cards.

Trick-taking games are very hit and miss for me, and I just wasn't all that enthralled by this one.  Yeah, the idea of avoiding the bottle is a neat little twist, but I didn't find anything compelling enough to make me want to play this all that often.

Big redeeming factor here is that it's at its best with three players, which is a rarity for trick-takers.

Played once - concept takes a few hands to get down.  Lots of different strategies.  Will need to play again.
Much better playing the second or third session.  Still has a steep learning curve.

Great little trick-tacking card game.  A little reminiscent of Triumvirate(but obviously amenable to a higher player count).  I wonder whether it will hold up over repeated plays, as a large part of the fun so far is in muddling through the strategy.  Would love to try it again.

Thanks to Larry Levy for opening my eyes to this one.

This is perhaps one of the most heavily themed trick-taking games I've played (though see Jekyll & Hyde, a.k.a. Twilight).  "The Bottle-Imp," the Robert Louis Stevenson short story on which this is based, has a theme that's perfect for the game's mechanic.  I felt the text on some of the cards was distracting; perhaps a small illustration and smaller text would make those match better with the cards that only had large pictures printed on them.  The cards all fit the story well, though.

RATING: 7
This is more a long run game in the sense that traditional card games don't necessarily allow you to demonstrate your skill in a single hand or game so much as they do over the long haul. To my mind it is just hearts with frills but who doesn't enjoy a game of this nature occasionally. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
We can't quite get the hang of this weird trick-taking game.  (The highest card played that is lower than the current imp number takes the trick.  If noone plays a card lower than that number, than the highest card played takes the trick.  Whoever takes the last trick of the hand receives negative points instead of the points earned by the tricks he took.)  We have mostly played 2-player and have tried both variants.  The first one uses a dummy player, whose hand is visible to the real players.  The dummy almost always takes the last trick, so the real players compete to get the most points in the tricks they have taken.  With the second variant, each player has 2 hands, one held up and one visible in front of him.  Whoever is dealt the next few numbers lower than the starting imp number sweeps up.  In this case, the challenge is not to take the last trick.  One player ends up with negative points, and the other ends up with positive points, so the score evens out over multiple hands.  The game is better with 3 real people.  As we are used to traditional trick-taking games, the gameplay is often counter-intuitive to us, but the game leaves us wanting to try again.  As a sidenote: the game comes with a copy of the Stevenson story that it takes its theme from; it's a good read.

RATING: 8
I get the distinct impression that it is very chaotic amongst new players, but I'm hoping that it can shine with an experienced trio. The shrinking range of trump ranks, the penalty for winning the last trump trick, the bizarre distribution of suits, the fact that you can take non-trumped tricks with an off-suit card if you are void. If the chaos can be contained, this has the makings of a really stellar little game.

My second play - a full game of eight hands - confirmed that this is a very cool game. It seems to be a balancing act - don't get the imp's trick more than everyone else, but always try to be taking more points.

Despite popular opinion, I think four might be the best number.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Initial plays are deceptive: it seems that luck is the dominant factor.  If you keep playing the stengths of hand management, signaling in the initial card passing, and careful timing, then card play will come to the fore (with a good group).  Best with 3.

Update: I'm concerned that the strategic patterns for hands are starting to seem extremely narrow and obvious.

RATING: 7
This game requires quite a bit of thinking and tracking. It actually takes a couple of games to figure out a decent strategy and even then, there is always a risk of it failing miserably.

Everyone playing should have the same (proper) level of understanding, otherwise the game becomes frustrating for those who do not understand it as well, which is no fun at all for the other players either.

Avoid this game if you are unwilling to invest some thought into each and every game or if you are not good at understanding games with a bit of complexity due to the requirement to think outside the box. DO buy this game if you like a challenge and do not mind if your plans are thwarted time and time again, and know other people who feel the same.

First 10 plays: Wonderfully original light-medium, serious, tricky card game; not complicated, not too simple for an intelligent quick game with some luck.  And it is quick (just a 30 card deck [-1 starter = 29] with adjustable point goal).  It's curious.  The decreasing greatest-under-upper-bounds trump mechanism, if I have the terms right, is so terrific.  You want to take and keep the bottle to score more points, but not for too long...can you get rid of it?  The theme works. The three suits are have different personalities, which I appreciate in a card game. The modern artwork is nice, straightforward, and pleasant, but the original is inspired, silly, disturbing and dangerous--real art.  (Update - after 20  plays, I think maybe there's too much luck for my tastes; I still like the game, but dropped my rating, prefer Where's Bob's Hat.)

RATING: 7
I'll jump in and say it now, I was a fool not to get this game sooner. 3 person trick taking games are a hard catch, and Flaschenteufel delivers the goods. So many subtle things are going on in this one, and there are many nifty tricks one can pull to get rid of a hated low number card. The "wrong" distribution for the suits takes some getting used to, but once you're used to the deck it actually leads to a tonne of interesting play options. Said distribution and the subtlety that is often involved in good play does mean that, like many card games, this one really needs to be played several times by the same group together before its full potential starts to show through.

The only real downfall of this game is the lack of the bidding, which makes it seem more shallow than games like Spades, but the subtleties of play in this game are more fluid than a standard trick taker too, so it still ends up getting a good overall mark.

There is some randomness, like any card game getting too many of the "bad" cards, in this case low numbers in the Yellow suit will lead to a wretched loss for the hand, but the plus side is that you're still not going to be killed by it, as the worst is usually around 10 points lost and that, if you really have that many low cards, that you can at least take a majority of the tricks for the hand. Sure, you will score the negative points for being stuck with the bottle at the end of the hand, but you will also be denying your opponents significant scoring as well. 

A seriously entertaining game of chicken tends to break out because of the mechanics of the bottle swapping in any case, and there are some very neat ways to stick your neighbours with it through skillful card passing at the start of the game. 

Playing to 250 is the way to go, the 500 that is suggested in the rules would make a game last way too long (as monster hands usually score around 50). At 250 the average game seems to be about 10 hands give or take, which seems right for a more involved trick-taker.

One major complaint about this game is the production values. The bottle (wooden) is excellent, but the cards are cheap, thin stock, and after 2 games they were already showing wear and I had to buy sleeves for the deck. If this was a 5$ game I wouldn't mind, but given that this was 16$ I wish the company would have made more of an effort to make sure the card stock was high quality. Another is the fact that this one starts to feel a bit scripted with repeat play. Knowing where certain cards are means that players can opt to aggressively drop the trump value to avoid being stuck with the bottle. It's not always the right play, but after several games of this, I think the shine is coming off because of that. This is best played once in a while at this point.

Reasonable game for 2-4 players. Quite light. Although I'm not sure I understood the rules correctly. It says the highest card takes the trick even if you can't follow suite as long as all the cards are above the imps trick. This is clear, but does that mean the highest card under the imps trick also wins even if you can't follow suite. Traded for Augsburg 1520

Find it difficult to say how I feel about this game other than I 'really like' it. Plays very quick, some nice tactical decisions about when to play your cards - especially your high cards and when to safely win the bottle yet dump it later, some high-scoriong tricks tucked safely under your arm. It's not my favourite trick-taking game but I do like it a lot and it's great with three. I tend to spend most of the game just working out how I am going to avoid ending up with the bottle rather than maximising my score which isn't the best strategy.

I'm not one for modern cardgames which build on the concept of tricks and the like. Flaschenteufel is no exception. It is a trick-taking game with a twist: suits are simple (there's just three of 'em), but the problem hides itself in being the owner of the flask at the end of the game. This definitely is a rather nice variation on the age-old mechanic of the trick, but after a few hands I usually feel like doing something else again. I just don't find it a particularly engaging mechanic, despite its immense historical value.

This trick taking game is pretty nice.  I've only played it once, but I'm already thinking about strategies.  It would be a nightmare of card counting if it weren't for the fact that a few cards are out of each hand.  But in practice, this may be one trick taking game too many, and doesn't hit the table often.

RATING: 5.5
The rules make this game sound a tad more confusing than necessary.  The concept is relatively simple - try to win hands with the highest value card, or with the highest card below the current threshold.  As the threshold drops, it becomes a time bomb - you don't want to be caught with it at the end.

The art is interesting and attempts to relate a short story by R.L. Stevenson.

Not a great game, but a filler that will appeal to some.

Both an entertaining game and an excellent distillation of the short story's core concept into a game. Has some lovely, twisted dynamics.

Components: Functional numbering and value symbols; nice art; interesting quotations. Great wooden imp.

Experience: Clever trick-taking game. The cards worth less than the imp are like trump, which can sometimes be good (to easily win some valuable cards) but sometimes bad (if I won't then be able to get rid of the imp). I enjoy the asymmetry between the colored suits as well.

Very difficult to manage my hand. The entire round becomes about successfully dumping my low cards without getting stuck with the Imp. The theme works great, as I feel the threat of doom looming over my poor decisions.

Wonderful integration of theme into a rather abstract card game.  My only complaint is that my version (by Z-Man games) doesn't include a printed copy of the short story this game was based on in the box.

Some people swear the best way to play is by passing low cards and then crashing the bottle value - hopefully sticking someone else with the negative points while accepting whatever you can win without any trump in the game.  This "strategy" is boring, inefficient, and leads to a random game in most cases.

Others try to hold onto the bottle and manipulate the use of trump to win as many tricks (and points) as possible, getting out at the last second each hand.  Although more difficult, the potential rewards are much greater and the game is more enjoyable this way.

Just be sure you have a group that understands card games or is unafraid to break from basic groupthink patterns, and you'll likely enjoy this great trick-taking game as well.

Cool mechanism -- the trump cards are all the cards lower than the most recent trick-winning trump card.

Clever trick taking with assymetric suits.  Passing gives some control on leader.  Shorting yourself in yellow is dangerous.  Nice hand variation: some hands you're focused on accumulating points; others, you're desperate to get rid of low cards.  Not sure what you can do when you get multiple low cards, just hope it doesn't happen.  UPDATE: A geekbuddy suggested that with a bad hand try and pick up every point possible.  Don't even try to avoid the inevitable.  DOWNGRADE.  Play can get a little unpleasant.

Very interesting falling trump mechanism.  And the fact that suits are more a suggestion than anything since a higher off-suit card will win a trick takes some getting used to.  But some cards are always bad to have.  In Hearts, having the QS is kinda good since you can control who gets hit, but here, the 1 is just always bad.  Possibly horrible, and at very least just useless.  That's not a good design.  This might lose rating after I play it more and the interesting bits wear off.

[b][FirstPlayOn19thJuly2013][/b] Trick-taking/climbing game is a game that I will never going to understand. The game is simple but I still can't get the hang of it. Obviously this will change over repeated plays.

Bottle imp is a little unique in a way that apart from playing a card to win the trick, you need to watch out for the bottle imp. Having bottle imp is bad so you don't want to have it when the game ends. The bottle imp will be passed around until the game ends, which the owner will count negative points for all the cards beneath the bottle imp (which were placed during setup). You get bottle imp when you play a card valued lower than the current value of the bottle imp.

Quite an interesting game I'd say. Something I don't get when I first played it, but I still had fun. It's a really good 3 player game like what BGGers have said.

I can't really play this game without comparing it to other trick taking games.  people say that it's the pinnacle of 3 player trick taking games.  I will say that I firmly disagree and think that title belongs to Sticheln.  Not only is the base game better than Bottle Imp, but included is a wide variety of ways to play the game.  Well, this isn't a Sticheln ad but I would strongly recommend you try that one.  My problems with Bottle Imp was that it just felt too random (despite being able to give away cards from your hand) and that luck plays a more of a role than I would like.

Günter Cornett has a great talent for inventing interesting trick-taking games with a twist, and “Bottle Imp” is no exeption. 
In this game each player gets a distribution of 36 cards (numbered 1-18 and 20-37) in 3 colours. The trick is won by the player who played the highest card of the same colour (or any colour if he is out of the colour) which is the highest lower card as the current “bottle imp”, or, if nobody played a card below the imp’s number, simply the highest card. 
Of course this is not as simple as it sounds. Well, it didn't even sound simple to start with!
“The Bottle Imp” is not only a clever game, but also lovingly crafted around a famous short story of Rudyard Kipling, which, as an additional bonus, is fully included with the game, in German AND English (as are the rules). Luck of the draw might play a role, as if you have many very low cards in your initial draw it will be very difficult to get rid of all of them at the right time, but still this is a very enjoyable card game that doesn’t leave the brain out of work and also has a high “fun through torture of other players” factor. Recommended!

This is one of those good trick taking games that adds a new element of gameplay, but doesn't really betray the concept of the trick taking game. If you want to score high in the bottle imp you have to be willing to take the bottle, but also have a plan to get rid of the damn thing! 

A few more plays have shown me that three is really where this game needs to be played.

(As of [b]7[/b] plays) Fast trick-tacking game with a shifting trump twist that adds interesting decisions beyond simply optimizing your own hand.

Played 1 time. Theme is very dark, but actually has almost nothing to do with anything, since this game is just a clever take on a trick-taking game. It could have been about trying to keep the Silly Rabbit from eating a bowl of Trix. (My idea Copyright 2003 Yirmeyahu Avery =) Still, as far as I see it, nothing that makes me want to run out and buy it. I think Land Unter has more unique mechanics and is better filler, Frank&#039;s Zoo is family friendlier and has partnerships, and For Sale is much better. Throw in the rather dark theme of damnation and I can&#039;t see this being worth owning.

Trick-taking game with an interesting take on trump.  Trump starts as cards under 19, but each time trump wins a trick, trump is cards underneath the card that won the last trump trick.  In addition, the bottle goes to the person who used trump to use that trick.   When the hand ends, the person holding the bottle takes a penalty.

This is a wicked cool little trick-taking game that I haven't quite wrapped my brain around.

Sadly the folks I play this with didn't cotton to it as much as I did.  So I don't get to play it more to learn more about it.

Also, might be prone to the occasional degenerate hands where players plunge the value of the Imp quickly, forcing someone else to get stuck with it after only one "trade".  I still think there's some strategy to walking down the trumps to claim points, pitching off the Imp at the last minute.

Bottle Imp is a trick-taking card game.  I was intrigued by the dilemma it creates: if I play to win the Bottle Imp, I get the points but the risk of going bust at the end of the hand. I can avoid the Imp altogether, but risk getting nothing the whole time.  Or should I bid high and hope everyone else does too without going over my bid? There's constant decision making and guessing your opponent's intentions. Amazingly, the theme works. The Bottle Imp brings you riches, but hold on to it too long, and it digs you a grave. Want to get rid of it?  You have to sell it for cheaper than what you bought it for.  The artwork is eerie and the game is accessible to most, though it takes a few rounds to get the flow. A huge luck component with the initial hand that is given, but it isn't too much of a drawback. Overall, this is a solid trick-taking game for those who are a fan of the genre.

RATING: N/A
I've read that Bottle-Imp is a great three player trick-taking game, but I have some reservations.  Granted, I've only played a few times with the same group of players (my parents), it seems that the holder of the '1' card is destined to take the bottle imp.  Basically, it seems like the penalty for taking the imp is so great that it behooves the players not to play for points, but to play only to not get the imp.  It seemed like the two winners would split 40ish points and the imp would get ~-6.

What this does to the game is forces a standard play for each position. 1) Play a low-value card above the imp or the highest card left in the game.  2) Either try to take the trick with a high card or throw away a losing low-value card above the current bottle value.  3) Play the highest card or take the trick via the bottle trump. I believe this happens because its not worth using the bottle trump if it allows other players to discard low cards (1-4), endangering your low cards.  Thus, the 1 (or 2 if the 1 is in the imp's trick) always takes the imp at the end.  

Granted, the last game I played I had the 1 and decided to take as many tricks as possible exploiting the imp as often as possible.  All this did, though, was mean the other players got less points.  I still got stuck with the imp.

A pretty brutal trick taking game revolving around the imp bottle. The highest card played that is below the current bottle number is the trump card. That card becomes the new bottle number. Whoever ends the round with the bottle scores 0 for the cards they won and the lose points for cards hidden in the middle at the beginning of each round. There is also a pass the card phase at the beginning of each round.

This game can get swingy with scores of 50+ a round and negative 15+. The mechanics of this game are very interesting and worth exploring

Wish they reprinted the game, maybe with better art.

Easily my favourite card game now.
Definitely much more than your typical trick-taking card game.  The suits add a lot to the game.  At first, seeing only three suits, I wondered about their place in the game, but having played a few times with three players, I can see that they have been very cleverly used.  It's strange that I'm having such a difficult time wrapping my head around the strategy!  I can't wait to play this again and to see if having four players makes it less enjoyable and strategic.

Dropped a half point from my original 8/10 rating.  With four players, it's a lot harder to plan your strategy.  My friends also aren't entirely sold on the "fun" of the game.  Much like Glory to Rome, I think their feeling is that it's not enough fun for the amount of thinking required.  Too bad for me, as I quite enjoy the different nature of the game.

Flaschenteufel ‐ English Edition (2003) . Very good light-medium, trick-taking card game. Plays well with 3 or 4. Interesting mechanic with the bottle imp giving you opportunities to take tricks you wouldn't otherwise, but at a cost of some risk. No hand is perfect, and while there are bad hands, it's still possible to figure out ways to mitigate your losses, or find a chance at an escape route. If you get to a very high level of play, the decision space sort of maxes out and the luck of the draw becomes more important Theme is really well applied to the game.

After reading the story and then playing the game, it is nice to see how the theme works.  You can take a nice trick by taking the bottle, but then it is a case of getting rid of the darn thing.  It can be tough to dump a low card.  Definitely a nice twist on a trick-taking game.

Components: good quality on the cards
Complex: easy to learn and play
Weight: light
Players: 4
Length: 30 mins
Mechanics: trick tracking
Decisions: not many but enough, which card to play, should I go for the genie?
Opinion: not bad trick tracking game, there are cards in 3 colors with different numbers on each, the idea of the game is to get as much cards as you can with your tricks. You play one by one, and the highest wins, except someone plays one of the appropriate color below the genie value (the first value is 19, then depends on the card winning it). The genie gives more options, but if you have it at the end of the round you score nothing.
This is a game I would play if it's on the table, but haven't found much joy on it. I think there are better trick tracking games out there. The control and the luck of the card is crucial in the game. But can leave you without any options. You can have a very good hand and win almost everything, while being out of the game the next one

Flaschenteufel has been one of our staples lately when 3 of us need a filler.  It's a great little game that requires some acclimation to the bizarre suit numbering and the unique strategies.  I've gotten pretty good at avoiding the bottle, but I don't always do as good a job of maximizing my score.  Flaschenteufel is also the only trick-taking game I've played that has an authentic-feeling story arc incorporated into the gameplay.  The 3-handed and 4-handed versions require such different strategies that they feel like two distinct games.  Both are good, but I definitely prefer the 3-handed version, with its larger hand size and smaller chance of players being short-suited.

It's ok.  It has a I go u go feel as the points leader switches from round to round.  If you're leading you're getting the 1 and 2!

Sitting in second place until the last round is the best way to win.

Hard time getting this to the table. Very unusual trick taking game that would take some getting used to. Don't know if I have anyone dedicated enough to blunder through a few games to work out the strategy of it. Currently feel underwhelmed by the obvious initial strategy: drop the price of the bottle quickly to ensure your own safety, repeat each round. Ultimately this will not be the best way to play every hand (certainly not the most fun), but it will happen ALL THE TIME anyway.

Interesting trick-taking contest whose theme fits perfectly with the game play. Game is best with three players, I think, as you only have eight cards in your hand with four. The only negative is that there are a lot of points in a hand and one person is guaranteed to get a negative score, so the point spreads have the potential to become enormous.

This is a good little game, but playing to a point value makes it drag way too long. I like the risk factor of playing a trump, and the greed factor of determining how long you can get away with it.

Let's start off by I suck at explaining games.

So, there was a bit of confusion to start.

Then add on that we started after midnight.

That on top of 'trick taking' games aren't among my favorite genres.

So, the game ended up being 'so-so'.  As the game progressed, there were a lot of 'strategies' emerging and could see how to 'push' the bottle away from you.  (and when not to worry about taking the bottle).

But, with three 'experienced' gamers we ended up playing only to 250 points as we were playing almost an hour at that point.  I'm sure we'll get a bit faster, but we weren't slow playing.  I can see 'speeding' up some with experience (although with experience I think there will have to be more thought it some of the plays), I just don't see this playing in 30 minutes if playing to 500.

A trick-taker with a convincing theme? Who would have thought. The story, in short, is that there is a bottle imp who will convey its magical powers to any and all (here in the form of trump) but this devious imp collects its dues in the end from whoever is stuck with him in the end (in the form of negative points at the end of the round). Players dance the knife's edge by playing trump to take large sums of points but, with the bottle's value ever dropping, an increasing risk of being stuck with the bottle in the end. As such, the Bottle Imp is a trick-taker which places its players in an immediate and unavoidable proximal relationship. Between the 3 unevenly distributed suits, as well as the passing off and tucking away of cards (both to remove cards from the round and to shape how many negative points are earned by the bottle-holder), this game is in a constant state of un/knowability, vaccillating between being countable and not. A tense little ditty for 3.

RATING: 6
[Initial Impression: 6] This is an interesting variation on trick-taking games of the type wherein "some cards are good, while some are bad". In fact, it is probably one of the better games of this type (but these things just don't thrill me). The neat twist is that which cards are good and bad for you can change based on the history of card play. The main mechanic is the bottle - whoever gets stuck with it at the end of the game gets a negative score (based on the value of cards secretly discarded at the beginning of the hand). The bottle starts on a value 19 card, and all other cards below this will "buy the bottle" by winning the trick, i.e., they are trump. This means, for example, that the 17 and 18 are good cards to have because they are the highest value trumps at the beginning of the game and will therefore win tricks. But, if someone takes a trick (and the bottle) with, say, a 12 (meaning that now cards 1-11 are trumps) and  you still have the 13-18 in hand, these cards are now not very valuable - they won't take the bottle (which is good), but they are also unlikely to win any tricks (bad). There's also a bit of game theory to go on - you know that no one can use the 1 or the 2 to win a trick (because they'll almost certainly be stuck with the bottle), therefore you can't win with a 3, or a 4, etc. The point at which this chain ends, because you have to play out all your cards, will shift depending on the distribution of cards and on the players individual strategies.

The Bottle Imp (Flaschenteufel) is an interesting adaptation of a Stevenson short story into a trick taking game.

It consists of a short deck if 36 cards in three suits with ascending value throughout, so that hands divide evenly for 2-4 players, plus a start value card and the ominous little bottle of the title.

Basically whoever takes the bottle in a round forgoes points won in tricks and takes a penalty instead.

However taking the bottle wins any trick on the board, so it is potentially positive idea to do so, as long as one can pass it off later on.

Players must follow suit if possible, and if the bottle doesn't come into play highest value wins, regardless of suit.

If a player plays under the current price for the bottle, the highest value under the current price takes the trick, but places the bottle in the winning card, replacing it with the previous price.

Cards also have a coin value, which is their worth for victory or penalty.

At the start players have an opportunity to hide or pass unwanted (low) cards, with one card seeded to each other player, and one out of play in the Imp's trick.

Often players will receive difficult cards passed to them in this way, but can use this to get rid of low cards in the original hand.  Coins anted to the Imp score sum total coins as the bottle holders penalty.

It a quick playing, clever game, with good card quality, bilingual rules, decent artwork, and an actual wooden bottle for the imp in this version, as well as a bilingual text of the short story inspiring the game.

Because someone takes a penalty every hand, there is a certain amount of screw age as well.

This is a smart little card game, with a very clever riff on trick taking.

a trick taking game with an eeeeevil twist.  I have adored this game since I was first introduced to it at the Gathering, in its original form.  The original art looked like it was done by a demonic 5 years old....the updated art is much more palatable to the general public, and in my opinion quite good.  I love having quotes from the story on the cards. !

The 3p game is amazing, unlike any card game you've ever played before.  The ever-shifting trumps and the card distribution (one suit is weighted to the top, another toward the bottom; the last one is evenly distributed throughout) will bend your head in the best way possible.  The trick is to figure out how to get into the devil-humping business and then get out when the bottle is cheap, but not TOO cheap...

For whosoever hath the bottle at the end GOES STRAIGHT TO HELL!!!

The 4p game works, but just barely; with fewer cards in hand you have fewer options and less control.  This really wants to be a 3p game.

But all in all, highly recommended—just don't confuse it with the ribald and scandalous [i]Fleischenteufel[/i].

Moderately complex trick taking card game. Rather in the shade of Schnappchen Jagd and Frank's Zoo but not a bad three player game. Unfortunately the nature of the game makes bashing the leader (and you have to bash someone with the cards you pass on) and the luck of the card draws feature quite strongly. Played over a series of rounds so things even out. But not completely. Plenty of options in card play though.

Good game.  Wish there was a version without the written story on the cards.  I didn't feel comfortable keeping this one around with my kids and all the references to hell on the cards, so I traded it away in 10/2009 for Bazaar and Democrazy.  That's just me.  Too bad because I like the game.  It's a game of difficult choices.

RATING: 7
I liked this a lot better than the people I played with liked it, but then, I'm a bit of a sucker for trick taking games.  This is an unusual trick taking game because there aren't exactly suits per se--there are colors that you must follow if possible, but cards of different colors still count as their number if played.  This tripped people up a bit (partly my fault) but it also means that there are certain risks to playing certain cards; you might let someone get rid of the 1 and you really don't want to. The bottle is a little punitive, but of course, you're playing several rounds and if you don't suck, you probably won't take it every time. Anyway, I liked this as a trick taking game that makes your mind work in a slightly different way from the usual.  (1 play)

The mechanic for lowering the price was a nice way to make Flaschenteufel more strategic than your average trick taking game. The two player version is not really any fun if played by the rules because you know exactly what cards your opponent has. We play two players only get 13 cards and must place one under the bottle. Two cards are placed under the bottle from the unused cards and the players must swap a card.

First played this on March 13th, 2007.  This is a quick learn and quick play.  It's a play off of a book and has it's own uniquely interesting set of elements to the game.  There is some decent strategy and luck in this.  After a few game plays you might find yourself getting the summary from the cards in the game as it does summarize the book.  It's worth a game play to try out.  You will probably like it better if you like trick taking games.

I'm only 1-play in, but thus far it seems very enjoyable.  As others have said, it does an *amazing* job of matching theme to mechanics for a trick-taking card game.

I think the underlying game of hot potato makes for a very enjoyable play experience.

With no bidding involved though, I could see occasionally getting completely screwed by the deal occasionally.

Will have to try this one more!

I've played a bit only against AI (http://www.flaschenteufel-online.de/ ).  And despite I can see that the algorythm is not a demanding opponent, the game didn't impress me at all.  It felt emotionless and repetitive.  In many tricks you have no choice or it's obvious.  In other words the game fell flat.

RATING: 7
Game deserves its reputation I figure, but have only played once so far (edit - played twice now).  The rules are very simple, but a tad tricky to grasp, it really wasn’t clear to me how the negative points worked and had to re-read it and check bgg.  Like the rules, the game play is quite simple but strategy was a little tricky to grasp, too.  After a few rounds, you start to see though and it comes together nicely.  

Its very similar to other trick games with a nice twist not unlike Old Maid or Hearts, you are collecting points by winning tricks but someone is going to win one trick that will lose them the whole round, and you don’t want it to be you.  This coupled with card/point distribution makes the game, as its not always clear what cards you should be playing, and there are 3 cards removed from play which also ups the intrigue on that front.  

It really helps if you can keep track of the lower cards that have been played, especially numbers 1 to 6 or so, my memory is terrible but this is only 6 cards so not bad.  Really trying to track all the 36 cards would be very helpful.  

Good game, I’m just not sure yet how long it will last, maybe the decisions become too obvious after more play, but the 3 removed cards will help here as you will never know for sure if someone threw a low card there (low cards are the ones that can sink you, and the only way out of it is to play under someone else’s low card, with cards removed you usually can’t be sure).

RATING: 8
Rated after a single 2-player game (open/closed hand variant), sixteen 3-player and fifteen 4-player games.

This is quickly becoming my favorite trick-taking game.  The low / high trick taking is clever and fits with the theme of the short story.

Two-player does not seem to be the ideal number, as one player will always go up and the other down so point swings can be drastic.  Additionally with all cards either in your hand or your opponent you can (with a little effort) know the cards your opponent has.

Three player is probably the best number, and most tense; you have to be very careful in your play of the lower numbers.

Four players is still enjoyable, and allows for creative and nasty card play.  It does lose a little, as you don't have as much control as when playing with 3.

Fun trick taking game. Reminiscent of Sticheln. The game rules are very easy to teach, but the game is not obvious and it has a lot of depth in it, it takes a while to get the hang of it. As I read the book from R.L. Stevenson I was primed to try this and was surprised to find that the theme works well. The game doesn’t disappoint. I think this can become one of my favorite trick taking games. The game has luck in it, but the mechanics (you pass 2 cards to your neighbors) make it more strategic. So I believe luck won´t control most of the winning hands.

I prefer to play this as a 3 player game, with 4 players you have less control (more luck). 

Definitively a good game.

Very unusual and fun trick taking game for 3-4 players.  The way that the hand plays out has a huge impact on which cards will actually end up winning tricks.  It does kind of blow when you don't get dealt any of the really BAD cards (the 1-4), since you know they will end up getting passed to you.

Played The Bottle Imp for the first time on Thursday night.

At its core it's a trick taking game.  37 cards in three different colours are dealt, with the '19' card held out to determine 'trump.'  You then pass one card to each of the other players (we only passed left and right) and an extra card to the 'bottle.'

You then play to tricks.  You must follow suit if you can, otherwise you can play any card.  If anyone trumps the trick (i.e.-plays a card with a value lower than the bottle card), then the highest trump wins and becomes the next bottle card.  If no one plays a trump, then the highest number wins (not necessarily of the colour of the suit lead)!  WTF? 

When compared to other trick taking games, this is confusing and illogical.  Why bother to have suits at all if the highest number is going to win?  Why shouldn't the lead colour win the trick like every other trick taking game?  Makes absolutely no sense to me.

Play then continues until all cards are played.  The last person to grab the bottle takes the initially dealt bottle cards and scores negative points... all other players score positive.  Are the points based on the card values?  Hell no, that would make too much sense. Each card is allocated some arbitrary number of 'coins' which are printed on the top of each card... and they aren't consistent (i.e. - the 35 is worth 5 coins, but the 34 is worth 6).

There seems to be too much luck in the cards. Good play will not always be enough if your opponents pass you the 1,2, and 3.  Because there are only  36 cards in the deck, you'd think that in a 4-player game you'd be able to short suit yourself, especially by passing cards.  I think in all but one hand last week, I managed a 3-3-3 distribution.

There are a lot of better trick taking games out there  (Tichu, Wizard, Turn the Tide,  For Sale... even Frank's Zoo).  Why bother with this one?

I just didn't find it much fun.

RATING: 7
Great little trick taking game that offers an interesting trick winning condition.  Bottle Imp starts at 19.  The highest number below the bottle imp wins the trick.  In other words 18 is a guaranteed winner.  The bottle imp's new number is 18.  You try to sluff off your very low numbers (1-8) under other winning numbers (9-18).  Fun and interesting!

An unusual trick-taking game. Cards are numbered 1-37 with a mix of three colors scattered through those 37 cards (reds are generally high, yellows are lower, and blues are in-between). Players have to follow suit by color if they can, otherwise they can play any color. However, color has nothing to do with who wins a trick - the highest number typically wins it regardless of which color was led. The real twist here is how trump is handled. The 19 card is omitted and is the starting value of the bottle. Trump is the highest played that is lower than the value of the bottle. This card becomes the new value of the bottle and is now owned by the player who played it. So in the opening hand, for example, the 18 card would beat a 36 card because it is lower than the value of the bottle. In this way the value of the bottle continues to get lower and the player who ends up with the bottle at the end of the hand scores negative points instead of positive points. Most points (after a defined number of hands or an arbitrary point target is hit) wins.

This is a trick-taking game where manipulation of who leads is key. You always want the player on your left to lead as that gives you the best chance of dumping low cards without taking the bottle. You often want to sacrifice points to make that happen. It is usually better to get fewer points than to end up with the bottle. There can be wide point swings so playing a number of hands is key to evening that out. I enjoyed my plays of this quite a bit, but alas, my girlfriend did not. As that will severely limit my playings of this game, I shall have to let it go...

An unexpectedly thematic game.  The cards with text from the story are a little annoying, especially since (IMO) the mechanics of the game best exemplify the theme of the story.  I think it will take a few more plays before I really understand how to play well.  The summary card should obviously make a big difference, especially if you can track the cards that have already been played.  Still, I think my expectations were set a little too high.  It works well with three players, but is not an amazing game for me.  At least not yet.

Devilishly thematic trick taking game where a trick is won by the highest card unless someone buys the hot potato, and you won't get (very) far by playing it as safe as possible.

An excellent trick taking game.  Takes a few plays to wrap your brain around it, but once you do, a ton of possible tactics and strategies emerge.  The biggest thing you need to balance is taking tricks and not taking the bottle.  It won't help you to avoid the bottle if you don't win any tricks either.  One person will jump way ahead in scoring. 

UPDATE: This is for when you have three players.  Not nearly as good with four players. Much better choices for trick taking games when you have four...

Also, the artwork for the new Z-man edition is terrible IMO.  Glad I have to other version (with the bottle).

Preliminary 7 rating. The trump idea might be too much for some people to handle. There are some tricks to manipulating it but nothing so far that seems really difficult to grasp. Initially I'm concerned about replayability which I think is quite a bit lower for my wife and friends than necessary.

UPDATE: The trump mechanism is in fact interesting and clever, but I didn't see much space to explore. Traded.

Flaschenteufel is a quite nice trick-taking card game. The game itself is easy to teach and play IF you have played trick-taking games before. Few things that drops down the final score:
1) game is a little bit broken, because every now and then there is a situation that you can easily play number 2 or 3 card without fear that you will loose the game AND in a same time you know WHO will loose. 
2) with Flaschenteufel card deck you can play only one trick-taking game. With standard card deck there are hundreds of trick-taking games and some of them are a lot better than Flaschenteufel. So is this a good or bad investment? I would say, that this is a bad investment but that's only opinion of mine...

Played once, 3 players.  I don't know what to think of this game, yet.  It is different enough from other trick taking games to be worth playing, but the strategy didn't come easily to me in my first game.  I'll need to play again to solidify the rating and opinion.

A very clever "hot potato" trick-taking game, with only three suits.  Unique and unlike anything that most trick taking games have.  It's counterintuitive in that many times, when you win/take tricks, you will end up holding the Bottle Imp.  If you end the round holding the Bottle, you get negative penalty points.  Can be played to an agreed # of hands, -OR- as a race to X number of points.  Best played with four.

Excellent card game in which one seeks to avoid the bottle at the end of the game.  Definitely unique with the bottle mechanism and that the highest of the low cards played under the card with the bottle imp wins the trick...

A brilliant trick taking game. I really like wrapping my mind around this one. Tough to get a hold of at first, but definitely one of the better trick tacking games out there. With further plays I find that the strategy is really subtle in this one.

RATING: 7.5
Very nice trick-taking game with a unique mechanism that lends some risk to playing lower trump cards.  You can hurt yourself by being overly bold and you can be hurt by being stuck with unfortunate cards at the end of the hand.  I love how the plot of the short story guides the principal mechanism of the game.  This would probably be a game that I would enjoy more with repeated play among the same group of players.

A great trick-taking game for 3-players. If you have 4-players, there are better cards games to be had (i.e., Spades!). After many hands, I still don't know many strategies as each hand seems to play itself differently. For me, that is part of the allure of the game.

That said, this game is not for everyone. Trump is constantly changing and sometimes you have no choice but to be stuck with the bottle imp. If you don't like randomness, keeping track of cards, or keeping track of trump, stay away!

Somewhat to my surprise (at least as of 5 years ago or so) I love trick-taking games. Well, I love good trick-taking games, anyway. While is still need to answer one question about it with more play, by all appearances so far, Flaschenteufel is, in fact, a good trick-taking game and, as you would expect at this point, I love it.

For those of you a bit unfamiliar with ludological terminology, a trick-taking game is one that resembles Bridge or Spades or Euchre: each player plays one card form his hand in turn and the player who plays the best card wins the trick, taking all of the cards played. From that simple engine, a remarkable variety of games have been designed, and sorting the wheat form the chaff is a bit of a chore, especially when you add commercial games to the equation, each with its own custom playing deck.

Flashenteufel offers two major twists on the basic formula. First, it uses a suited deck, but each suit is distinctive. Each value between 1 and 37 is used only once among the three suits (with 19 set aside for a special purpose). Red tends toward higher-valued cards, while the lion’s share of yellow feature low numbers. Within each suit, however, it is worth more to win the highest value cards in a trick, since the value is indicated by dots on the card, not its face value.

The other odd bit is the ability to make a deal with the titular bottle imp. Players must follow the suit lead in each trick if possible, and the highest-face value card wins the trick, which can get a bit boring. However, the highest-numbered card played *that has a face value below the current value of the bottle* trumps the highest valued card to win the trick, and the bottle value becomes the number of the card that won the trick in this fashion. The sting in the tail, however, is that the player stuck with the bottle at the end of the hand loses points rather than gaining them.

These two bits together make for a highly entertaining, tense, and distinctive game. It’s easy to go for the bottle early in the hand, but you have to be careful about how low you go, which low cards you have remaining, and how many cards of each suit remain below the current bottle value (there is a handy value-suit reference card for each player to help with these problems). It’s all just a bit beyond my capability to manage until late in the hand, but that’s part of the fun.

The only possible fly in the ointment is that there may be trivially strong hands and trivially weak ones. I’m not good enough at the game yet to know for sure, but there are some glimmerings around the edges. Since it can take a bit for new players to play out a hand, the usual way of balancing this — playing enough hands to even out the luck — may not be practical, either. Therefore, I will be keeping a close eye on this issue. If it turns out not to be a problem, Flaschenteufel is one of the best trick-taking games around, in the same category as Ninety-Nine and Sticheln. If not, it will have to sit in the second tier with Die Siebel Siegel/Zing and Was Sticht? — good, but just a bit annoying.

RATING: 7
 It is a notable game for a number of reasons, not least in that it manages the rare feat of being a trick-taking game with a palpable theme, one that is very cleverly intricated within the game mechanics.  I grew up with some of the classic trick-taking games (with the standard deck of cards). But the Imp is trickier than most of them and all the more intriguing because of it. I feel like there is a way to get better at it that I have not quite figured out yet, something beyond counting the highs and the lows and how to finesses away a troublesome low card. It is a mind-bender.

This is my favorite trick taking game.  There are three suits and it follows standard trick taking rules except high card takes the trick. However, trump is played by playing a lower number than "the bottle" which starts at 19.  Whoever owns the bottle at the end of the game takes negative points based on how many points were played to the bottle at the beginning of the hand. 

Very fun game, and does take some time to get your head around it, but very deep once you do understand it.

This is a great game. It took a bit to get the rules down - they are not written all that well - but once we got it, we loved it. The game is really subtle. You are encouraged to take the imp early in the game in order to score tricks. It gets hairy toward the end, however, when you start getting nervous you might have to keep him. The art is figuring out how to pawn him off on someone else. It is also enjoyable trying to figure out how to capture the last couple of tricks at the end of the game - they are usually worth a lot.

Overall, a fun, engrossing game with simple rules.

Bottle Imp is fun, quirky, and solid overall. It's a very pure trick-taking game, and the imp mechanic is unique and interesting.

I'm not sure quite why, but Bottle Imp is less appealing to me than deeper and non-traditional card games like Biblios and Lords of Scotland as well as other more traditional card games like Wizard. Still a fun game, and definitely a good choice among traditional card games.

Oddly, going to hell is usually totally worth it: even with a high number of points in the imp's trick, you can usually get more points by controlling the bottle. This seems a bit funny in the context of the story, but otherwise the theme is well-expressed: the bottle is tempting to use, and not a real problem at first.

After some careful consideration, this wasn't good enough to hold onto -- I own much better card games that fill a similar niche.

The Bottle Imp is a great game to close out the night or to play casually with friend who are familiar with trick taking games. It may take a bit for those unfamiliar with the game to fully "grok" the changing numeric trump. That tends to shock people's worlds a little bit but we've found that once it clicks, people really get into playing.

We tend to now count points, instead just playing to not be stuck with the bottle playing as many hands as people want to play.

As for the game - I love playing this with three people.  It seems made for this number.  The game, like many trick taking variants, makes you really think hard in a non conventional way.  

If you lead to take the bottle your opponents can slough their lowest suited cards.  If you lead over the bottle it is unlikely you will win the trick because your opponent can buy the bottle or play higher.

Great, great game.

I haven't played enough to be certain, but it feels like the optimal strategy is often to play in a way which decreases the tension in the game (I won't go into details since there are some, including myself, who prefer to explore a game's strategies on their own).

Having said that, it's a game that has a unique and surprisingly thematic feel, and one that I am almost always happy to play.

It's two games melded into one. Spades (or some other straightforward trick-taking game) plus the bottle imp subgame (card lower than and closest to the price of the bottle imp gets the bottle) and you don't want the bottle imp in your possession at the end of the game.

To summarize: If you end up with the 1 & 2, you lose. The pass one card to the right and one to the left mechanism is pointless. You just pass your lowest cards. Might as well stick with the hands dealt.

This game crept me out. I mean, literally. Some of the text on the cards just got to me.
Otherwise this is a really offbeat trick-taking game. There is a lot of strategy to be used around the Bottle Imp, which I thought was cool. I couldn't see myself playing to 500 points, I think it would get a little repetitive after 10-15 hands (My guess is 500 points is about 40-50 hands, taking into account the negative 'you're in hell' bottle points).

RATING: 7.5
Another fairly nasty trick-taking game.  Like some of my other favourites the rules are straight-foward but the strategy isn't very intuitive.  A few more plays before I can fully grok what this has to offer.  UPDATE: I'm not sure if it's me that doesn't get it or if there's a control issue that exceeds the randomness of most card games.  Downgraded by 1/2 point until I find out.  ANOTHER UPDATE: Morgan described it as Russian roulette which is a perfect explanation.  It's a card game so some luck will play a part but w/enough hands played whomever wins should have earned it.

Can see that this trick-taking game ("enhanced" with a diminishing--and controllable--trump) has strategy, but it absolutely does not click with me.  The mechanics can be picked up, but I can't get beyond that -- almost to the point where it's painful for me to play.  Seems to be heavy on memorization of who has played which (low) cards, and who is out of which colors.

An odd, hard to wrap your head around, but utterly fascinating three-player trick-taker.

The game play reminds me of Hearts, where instead of trying to avoid being stuck with the Queen of Spades and hearts, you are trying desperately to avoid being stuck with the bottle. The card passing prior to playing the hand is also reminiscent of Hearts.  I wish there was something similar to Heart's "shoot the moon" option to provide for more variety in strategy.

Looking forward to playing this one. Got a copy because I'd like to try a trick-taking game and had been curious about them but wasn't interested in themeless ones like Bridge or anything. I really like bridge and I figured another game that used your brain but was short enough to play in 20 minutes would be a good filler for when we have parties and such. Plus, I just love imps.

There a certain hype around this game, which I do not get. It seems too out of control most of the time and the theme just feels out of place. It does not fall into the range of my favourite trick-taking games... and I have a strong affinity in trick taking games - it's Sticheln all the way for me.

Just another trick-taking game. Doesn't feel like anything particularly different. Unless you're really into trick-taking games, I guess. (OnLine version)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another very interesting trick taking game that requires you to think in an entirely different fashion than in a game like, say, Spades. Smart play can make any hand manageable and you need to be a bit of a risk taker to score points as most tricks will be taken by trump and if so, the one that wins the trick gets the Bottle Imp. If you play defensively and avoid any chance of getting stuck with the Bottle, you'll lose by a large margin because you need to take tricks to score points. Very clever and a lot of fun once everyone involved understands how to play the game.

I love the concept of this game.  Playing it is torture however.  It seems like no matter how well you do, you always are going to get screwed.  I cant bear to watch every player suffer when they get the bottle anymore.  Disheartening.

RATING: 7
It's interesting how trump value changes during the game. Surprisingly accurate shortstory-to-game conversion considering it's a trictaking game. It's often painful to win tricks. You'd like to collect as many points as possible but there is often increasing risk that you might be the one left with bottle and negative points.. I really like managing your hand. I previously had a feeling that game might be too mechanical but after a few more games it doesn't seem to be so. I'd rather play to 200 points as that takes about an hour and offers enough hands to compensate some of the worst ones.

My rating is for 3 player game. I haven't tried to play with 4 and believe that to be less exciting as there is more chaos and luck involved.

Clever and unique. There are hands that are easy to play as you rack up the points, and others where you feel the pressure tighten inexorably card after card as you try and work out a way to escape the seemingly inescapable misery burden of the Imp.

RATING: 7
A trick taking game where the trump is based on the current price of the "cursed" bottle. There are three suits ranging from numbers 1 to 37 however there is only one of each number. If you play below the current price of the bottle, that is trump, all other cards are not. You want to win tricks (hands) but you do not want to be the last one to play a trump card since you will thus hold the "cursed" bottle and all your points will be negative. A twist that works well as you can control it, somewhat at least since you can of course get tricked by the other players.

RATING: 6
This trick-taking game has a twist--if you play a card lower than the value of the Bottle Imp, you win the trick and take the Bottle Imp.  However, if you have the Bottle Imp at the end of the hand, you automatically lose.  Yes, this is as harsh as it sounds, and the game really becomes more about trying to safely get rid of your low cards than trying to exploit winning tricks with lower cards.  I'm not a fan of games where a player can automatically lose at the end, and I'm only lukewarm on trick-taking games to begin with, so this game didn't really strike a chord with me.  It certainly makes you think in different ways, though.

Trick-taking game with quite a nice idea of changing trumps, but you can really ruin your game too easily. ´I think that point system needs modifying: 500 points is just too much, try 200-250 instead. And I also hate the "the one with imp at the end gets nothing"...

A different take on the trump card in a trick taking game. I have to say it is very unique and I get why people like it. Definitely worth trying if you like trick taking games.

Simple trick taking game with great depth. My particular fancy with this game is the fact thatthe trump changes in value as you play and must avoid being the player stuck with the flask at the end. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The novelty here for trick-taking fans is that the trump card is the one with the face value below and nearest to the current value of the bottle. The winning card sets the new value of the wooden bottle which goes to the winner of the trick. A refreshing and tense game of risk taking of avoiding the bottle as holding it at round end subtracts your score, determined by the value of cards discarded at round start. Rewards players who know the card distribution and memorises cards passed and played. Point swings can be huge, so maybe best to play in rounds rather than first to a target score. Personally I prefer this with 3 players, and so occupies that rare niche, however it has since been undermined by Cosmic Eidex for staying power.  The new edition has the beautifully carved wooden bottle,  bold illustrations and brief storyline on the cards.

I'm a big fan of trick-taking and climbing games, as is my wife, and this one is our prime choice when we have 3 players (Haggis for 2p, Tichu for 4p). I have the older edition which comes with a copy of the Robert Louis Stevenson story that inspired the game, and a wooden 'bottle' to pass between the players. Although neither is essential, I think it's a great shame Z-Man removed them. The game is a brilliant match to the story, in which a bottle with an imp in it gives great power, but will curse whoever gets stuck with it unless they can sell it for less than they paid for it. 

It's a nasty little game, in which you aim to stitch someone else up with the bottle, while not ignoring scoring points for yourself. If people play too conservatively, to avoid the bottle, and don't worry about their points, it can become a bit dull. The idea is to take the bottle and the points that come with it, but make sure you can dump it on someone else later - just like the story!

Based on the short story by R L Stevenson, the Bottle Imp is a card game in which players aim to make the most points while ensuring that they are not stuck with the bottle at the end of the round. The player who has the bottle at the end of the round gets negative points. 

The game mechanics, although simple, take a couple of rounds of getting used to. There is some amount of luck but having a strategy on which cards to play given the game situation is also required. 

A nice second level gateway game that plays with 4 in about 30 minutes.

Great Game.  The tension of trying to use your low cards to snatch points while not getting stuck with bottle at the end is brilliant.

RATING: 7
Very clever card game.

However, after playing a lot of Mu, Cosmic Eidex, and many of [url=http://www.davidparlett.co.uk]David Parlett's[/url] card games, this card game doesn't have the depth or the variety of those other games.

* The shrinking trump suit is very innovative. However, it's a bit too easy to win a string of tricks if you have consecutive high trump cards. That's a small point though. What's annoying is that if someone suddenly "shrinks" the trump suit, then you might end up with cards that are simply not interesting to play -- it's not that fun when most of the cards in your hand are guaranteed losers.

* In normal trick-taking games, the highest ranking card can lose in one or two ways: being trumped and being tossed because you couldn't follow suit. In this game, the highest card wins, regardless of suit, meaning that there's less card play variety in this game.

Trick-taking card game with a twist. 

Takes a while to get your head around the "highest bid wins unless it's under the bottle price, in which case closest to the bottle price wins". However, have the bottle at the end of the round & your tricks don't count plus you get some negative points.

Definitely worth the time to get to grips with & timing of when to play cards can be vital!

There's not much to this game.  Yes, deciding which cards to pass is critical and some finesse moments may appear, but the bulk of this game is pure luck.  At best, this is a crippled version of Hearts with a pasted-on theme.  However, the wooden bottle is cool.  (Note: I've only played this 4 player which has too few cards to really be considered much of a game.  The additional cards in 3 player might make this game far more enjoyable, but I've already soured on this quite a bit.)

RATING: 7
As with many other trick-taking card games, the idea is to acquire the most points. The Bottle Imp works by ensuring that the highest card does not always take the trick. The player with the highest valued card that still fits under the price of the Bottle Imp receives the trick and also the Bottle Imp. The value of the Bottle Imp falls to the value of the winning card. The owner of the Bottle Imp changes until its value can no longer be undercut. Whoever owns the Bottle Imp at the end of the game receives minus points instead of positive points.

Unfortunately it's out of print right now and there is no way I'm paying $100 for it.  If it goes back into print, I'd buy it for sure.

I wasn't a big fan of this game at all. It was very difficult to get my head around the bizarre trick-taking methods, and at the end of the day I realized that I would *always* rather play Tichu than this game.

RATING: 7
A surprisingly fun little card game, called Bottle Imp in English. I played it a few times, and had a blast. Also, one of the few trick-taking games that works *best* with three. Rating may go up with more plays.

Variant to try: 
Each round, we deal out four hands, and one of them is "dead". No one knows the cards in there. This means that it's entirely possible that between those cards, and the Imp's Trick, there might simply not be a number out there that they really hope is there. This almost instantly cuts down on players playing a low card. Sure, it still happens (if one person has the 2, is the last player on a trick for which it is a valid play, and knows they passed away the 1 and it's still out, odds are they'll play it) but it adds a sense of uncertainty that can take this filler and make it more, well, "filler-riffic."

This is my favorite trick-taking game. The theme is based off of a short story (http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/bottlimp.htm) by Robert Louis Stevenson, which drives the dynamics of the trump value throughout the game.

During the first game or two, you'll be trying to distinguish guidelines for how to play the game, but you'll soon find out that the moment you think you have it figured out, the game will shut down what you thought you knew. I've heard many [i]definitive[/i] statements at the table, but most of them could be contradicted with the hand I was currently holding, which makes the gameplay feel differently every hand.

After 4 plays, with 1 or 2 first timers each game, I have become comfortable with the ins and outs of the game and have determined how to play the game safely, but I'm looking forward to playing with, or developing, an experienced group to see how the game style will adapt due to a more competitive nature. I imagine aggressive, riskier plays will become more prevalent down the road.

RATING: 10
Great depth in this game; card counting, opponent reading are just a couple of skills required to win this ostensibly simple game. 
It's also a great gateway game for non-boardgamers. 

There is also a bottle forcing action that resembles train rushing in 18XX. What's there not to like?

Interesting trick-taking game where the card's values are limited by this other card that gets passed around (the imp). The imp's negative value for scoring means that, while you can use it to your advantage during play, you don't want to be stuck with it in the end.

Another trick taking game. And what's new in this one is... oh, who cares - it isn't much. It's all a bit simple. There seems to be lots of luck in the cards. Good play will not always be enough if your opponents are good players and you find yourself with the 1 and the 4. I just didn't find it much fun - maybe I'm all tricked out. Funny, but I never tire of a good trick taking game like Mü. Still, the wife thought it was okay.

Nem semmi a játék, az ember agyának át kell állnia egy teljesen egyedi rendszerre. Három szín van a pakliban, 1-37-ig van számozva a lapok, amiben van egy speciális 19-es kezdő lap. A kör elején ki van osztva a 36 lap (19-es ugye kezdő és az asztal közepére van rakva a játék elején és rá van helyezve az üvegcse) a játékosok eldobnak titkosan egy lapot a kezükből, majd Tichu módszerrel a szomszédos játékosokkal cserélni kell lapokat. Ezután a kezdő játékos kijátszik egy lapot, a többieknek színrakási kötelezettséggel folytatni kell a kört (ha nincs olyan szín már valakinek a kezében, akkor bármilyen lapot letehet). Elvileg a legmagasabb értékű lap viszi az ütést, azonban ha kisebb értékű lap van kijátszva mint az üvegcse alatti lap értéke, akkor az a lap viszi az ütést és a tulajdonos magához veszi az üvegcsét és az új kisebb értékű lapot teszi alá. Így, mindig kisebb és kisebb értékű lapok fognak az üvegcse alá kerülni, jól hangzik de a játék végén akinél marad az üvegcse, az ütések értékét mínuszban kapja meg. Furcsa és érdekes játék, teljesen át kell állnia az agynak rá.

What a great game. A wonderful twist on trick-taking that's tied closely to the short story.

Puts a twist on your regular trick-taking game in that if you get too greedy and trump too much or at the wrong time, you're stuck with the bottle and score negative points. Wickedly clever, the theme actually fits and makes explaining the game easier to understand. This is the first trick-taking game I've played in a while that has a disruptive, innovative twist that is natural and is not there for the sake of twisting the game.

This game personifies GREED.

This is an absolutely excellent three-player trick-taking game.  The asymmetric suits provide a lot of opportunity for strong and creative play.  The theming is excellent.  This game can reward both bold and cautious play -- and to do well, you will have to play both ways at various times.  I regret that I am not playing this more.  But you need three for this game to shine. [01/08/2011]

I own a homebrew version of this game. This trick-taking game rightfully inspires dread (in a good way) as the 'price' paid for taking the trick rapidly spirals downwards. Getting rid of the lowest cards and avoiding the imp is a feat in itself. It is possible to get screwed just through your opening hand though, but you can mitigate the damage by pulling down the scores of everyone else.

My experiences have been quite good.  It's essentially a trick taking game, which means there's definitely a lot of "luck of the draw", but there's also *plenty* of strategy and lots of tension.  I like the art of the original release better (it's very primitive, in a good way), but the new art is pretty cool, too.  UPDATE:  I bumped my rating up a notch.  Like most good trick-taking games, Flaschenteufel gets better when the players et more experience.

Card. Trick-taking game with an interesting twist, reminiscent of Hearts. Played 3p once to 200 points. Not complicated, though it takes a few hands to wrap your head around some basic strategy. I enjoyed it, but some concern about being at the mercy of the deal in 3p. Would like to try it 4p.

Update: played 3p again and I think my earlier concerns are unfounded. Devilish game.

Traded. Too many other 3p games in my group, plus this one takes somewhat dedicated play to get a feel for it, I think.

An awesome trick-taking game for 3 or 4 players. I love how the trump changes throughout the round and that you need to own the bottle (which will give you a negative hand result) if you're really going to be able to score many points. Also, the story that it is related to you is quite interesting and it's awesome how well the card game matches the story.

RATING: 8
This game wins the award for best implementation of a theme in a trick-taking game.  At the same time, it could have been Icarus-themed.  The game encourages flying close to the sun.  Sometimes you get burned.

There's a lot to like in the Bottle Imp.  First, the cards in the three-suited deck are unevenly distributed.  The mix makes for interesting strategic considerations.  Second, it is not always obvious whether to use or discard your most powerful cards.  They are both assets and liabilities.  Third, pulling cards out of the hands of others can be profitable or devastating.  One player can completely control a round with luck and careful cardplay.

In a single round the game shifts with large gains possible. It might not be as deep or replayable as Sticheln or Ninety-Nine.  Not every game needs to be.

RATING: 6
This is a weird little trick-taking card game that takes a LOT of getting used to, but is pretty fun to play. Good decisions about which cards to pass to the other players, and which to bury (lots of points? short suit yourself? low card to mess with the endgame?). A fun game, but seems to drag on too long -- don't play for more than 250 or so points!

Based on Robert Louis Stevenson's story about a magic bottle: the imp within grants the owner any wish, but if you die while still owning the bottle your soul will BURN IN HELL FOREVER :devil: !!! The only way to get rid of the bottle is to sell it at a loss, so the price continually falls (presumably, if it's found later on you can sell it at any price?).

Cards are in 3 colors, numbered 1-37 (odd color distribution; player aid shows card colors), and are worth a variable # points each (1-6). At the start of the game, place the imp (bottle token) on the 19 (= current "price"). 

Deal all cards out. All pass 1 card face-down to each neighbor and under the bottle. Player to left of dealer leads first. If possible, must follow suit. All cards played with a NUMBER lower than current bottle card become TRUMP. Highest played (trump) wins the trick (add cards to your score pile) and leads next. If a trump won the trick, the winning card becomes the new price of the bottle: leave it face up with the bottle on it. If bottle later moves to another player, you keep the card under it (the previous price). Keep playing till all cards played (11 hands). Each player adds up #points taken (coins on cards), EXCEPT player with the bottle: his cards are worth ZERO points, and he LOSES the #points under the bottle! 

Play n hands or till x points; the player with the most points wins!

[Bambus Spieleverlag 2003 edition] {Novel; trick-taking, partial-hand-passing; optimal 4p} Unique trick-taking game with special score rule and the Bottle Imp. It fits excellently to its original story. The initial card exchange action is very important - it reduces the luck of the game and enhances player interaction greatly. Players should exchange cards carefully. In particular, they should pay attention to the distribution of colors in the hand. E.g. don't let other players give you the singleton low blue or yellow card. (In my games, Blue-4 is the most dangerous card to the owner.)

It is exciting and it's always funny to see who finally holds the Bottle Imp :) It is a fun 4p game and ok 3p game but 2p game is just not funny.

The quality of the game components is very good. The summary card really helps a lot.

RATING: 6
Clever trick-taking card game. Players are dealt a hand of cards, each with a different value, and these are used to bid on the bottle imp, which starts the game at 19. If everyone bids over the current value of the bottle imp, the highest card wins the trick. If at least one card is played with a number lower than the current value of the bottle imp, then the highest value lower than the current bottle imp wins the trick and gains possession of the bottle imp. Whoever has possession of the bottle imp at the end of the game receives negative points as opposed to the positive points their opponents gain from the tricks they have won. It's a fun game and the main strategy revolves around getting rid of your lower cards without gaining possession of the bottle imp, or getting rid of the bottle imp if it's in your possession, although their is a fair bit of luck in achieving this depending on the cards you've been dealt.

hard to get my head around it, but so far it seems very interesting. (1/10/14). My 3 player group still enjoys it, I think most of it is in the passing and once you grok this the game almost plays itself so it's gone down a notch. Considering alternative scoring simply based on how many tricks you win; and if you take the bottle then you subtract the value of the card used to take the bottle.

tl;dr: enjoyable but maybe not enough control

I'm not sure why, but most trick taking games require you to follow the suit the hand was opened with, if possible. I always find that so limiting and frustrating. I understand it opens up a lot of possible strategies, but that is mostly for the people leading a had. I had 2 rounds of this game where I couldn't accomplish anything. The order the colors came out left me no choices and no chances of setting myself up for the next rounds. So that can be very frustrating.
The next rounds did go better and where quite enjoyable. Ending the game with the bottle being a bad thing is a nice twist. But if your neighbors hand you like the 1 and the 2, and you already had a bunch of low cards, it can be very, very hard to avoid not losing the round.
So there is a good amount of luck and a good hand will let you dominate a round without much challenge.
So I have mixed feelings about this one. It doesn't beat [thing=354][/thing], that's for sure!

Interesting trick taking game. The game takes some getting used to with shrinking number of trump cards. You unexpectedly have a card that used to be trump no longer trump.

Needs to be played with experienced players. New players seem to eat the bottle imp for you so it makes it easy to just play a normal trick-taking game.

RATING: 6.5
I like Flaschenteufel (or, given that I have the Dutch version, "Die Bezeten Fes" or something equally interesting sounding).  The trick-taking mechanism is neat, although for new players you really need to have one of the cards that shows suit distribution handy for them to look at, else they may get caught with cards they weren't expecting.  Some oddities compared to standard trick taking games (if no trump is played, the highest card played wins, even if it is not of the suit led), and sometimes there's "Nothing you can do" if you're dealt a horde of low cards, but then, anyone that's been dealt a 4-3-3-3 distribution with a single jack in Bridge knows that's sometimes the way the cards come.  The rating is dinged only because there's so many filler type card games that this one won't get as much play as it otherwise could.

Update - Increased my rating from 6 to 6.5.  A very minor increase but it's seen a lot of play lately, and I've seen some of my opponents really make interesting use of putting strategic cards into the Imp's Trick.

Loved this at first while we were still working out the best strategies, and I tended to win most games of it by instinct, without having any definite plan. Now that our group seems to have sussed out the best way to win (or perhaps just settled into some group-think?) I'm finding it less fun.

Heard good things about this game, so was eager to try it out. Fell flat on first playing. Decided to try again, hoping to like it. Didn't. Tried once more, trying hard to like it. Didn't. Tried again, and again and again. I feel the same as I didn't on my first playing - "What was the point of doing what we just did? Where is the game in all this?" Feels like a pointless exercise. 
May be its just me. But *may be* it isn't!!!

Trick taking game where the trump "suit" is a number. Any card below the number trumps, but the highest trump played takes the titular Bottle Imp. Everyone gets points for tricks except for the last player with the Imp, who gets penalties.

Nice three-player card game with deductive reasoning and incomplete information. Sometimes feels like work, but the game goes quickly.

Not bad. After a few games I'm starting to wonder if the outcome is mostly determined by luck, though. If you get the right combination of cards you can be almost guaranteed to be stuck with the bottle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a nice little filler game. I've only played it with three players and after a few plays, it felt like you were dealt your own fate. You can try to mitigate your chances of taking the bottle, but if all the players are good, you can usually guess who's going to take it with the deal. I would recommend Tichu over this one as a small-box, tense, card game.

RATING: 8
A wonderful quality, capturing the Stevenson story. And laughing fun for a trick taker when someone gets stuck with the bottle or runs too far and, baffled, eats it. The asymmetrical suit distribution against card value is another layer to sort out.

The descending number ladder that forms trump is a tense delight, and spurts of running the table will get you stung if you go too far & leech out the disappearing low trump before passing it. The opening of passing two & burying one of three cards distributes information & just enough deck uncertainty, it can form big moves & make play tricky. Recognizing a good opening hand and pass/bury move is sweet, and the multi-hand meta game to get a winner brings a swingy variety that all good card games bring. 

Trick taking play archetypes are all there: trump to extract points, how to mitigate & when to run the table, the potential to crash & burn.

There's an interesting counterpunctual thing while running the table, between using trump & high cards in suit, that is highly variable hand to hand, really tricky & sets this apart.

Played 3-player.

RATING: 9
Great story and interesting, unusual mechanic.  Imagine, a deck of cards utterly different than a standard deck of cards - 3 suits instead of 4, numbered consecutively, with suits of color in completely different ranges throughout the deck, trump being all cards below the current bottle price. Don't get stuck with the bottle! It's become one of our very favorite games, and one of mine personally. It is currently my favorite 3 player game.  Great game, nice design, extremely fun to win!! 

This may be my forever favorite 3 player game. It seems to get better and better with every play. (My copy uses a nice ornate perfume bottle and has a miniature copy of The Classics Illustrated The Bottle Imp enclosed.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A kind of of trick-taking game with an original twist: The highest card normally wins, but it is beaten by any card that is played BELOW the price of the possessed bottle. That player wins the round, but also has to take the bottle which then takes on the (lower)price of the winning card. And the end of the game, the owner of the bottle loses all points gathered and obtains negative points instead.
Even more interesting: If more than one of the cards played in a round is below the price of the bottle, the player who obtains the bottle is the one who played closest to its current price. Crazy, heh? No need to stress that there is a quite a lot of "turn angst" in this game :-).

A devilishly diabolical trick-taker for 3 players. The theme, the fantastic short story by Robert Louis Stevenson, fits the game perfectly, and the trump mechanic makes for very interesting play. Unlike any other game, this game is just plain fun! It is awesome to have a very strange hand, and to hope for the best, trying to make your opponent who has the 3 take the bottle when you are stuck with the 4, 2, and 1. The best moment I had playing this game was when 9 of my 12 cards were yellow after the pass and I had passed away the 3 and the 1, and put the 5 under the bottle. (Crazily enough, I got 4 and 6 in return.) For the third trick or so, I led the yellow 12 (trump was 11), my left hand opponent was forced to play the 1 as he had no other yellows, and my right hand opponent only had the 2 and 3 of yellow, sticking him with the bottle. We all laughed for several minutes at the complete ridiculousness of the situation. I have never played with anyone who did not have a great time. I can't ever see myself not wanting to play this.

After almost a seven year pause, I managed to play this game ninth time. This game is good. This game is evil. I need to play this more to be better (I have never won). The game is quite simple trick taking game, 36 cards, 3 colors and rather tricky trump rule. It takes couple of rounds to understand the game, but after that - a great game. Fast to play.

RATING: 7
A very novel trick-taking game where the set of trump cards narrows every time a trump card is played and the player who trumps last - i.e. ends up with the bottle imp - scores negative instead of positive points. Not the deepest game, but tense and entertaining for sure. Definitely worth owning and pulling off the shelf every once in a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The player with the highest valued card that still fits under the price of the Bottle Imp receives the trick and also the Bottle Imp. The value of the Bottle Imp falls to the value of the winning card. The owner of the Bottle Imp changes until its value can no longer be undercut. Whoever owns the Bottle Imp at the end of the game receives minus points instead of positive points. Pass the parchment or else!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a VERY clever trick-taking game, with the trump characteristics changing almost with each hand, since trump is determined by card NUMBER, and not card COLOR.  It's a lot of fun, with mechanics included to help against the luck of the draw, but it takes a hand or twenty to best get how to play your cards.  It's very difficult to understand the subtleties of how to play your cards, so it's not the most intuitive game.  As far as three-player trick-taking games go, though, this is one of the best.

As with many other trick-taking card games, the idea is to acquire the most points. The Bottle Imp works by ensuring that the highest card does not always take the trick.

This was a pretty easy trick taking game, and I liked the way the idea of Bottle Imp changing hands tied to the premise of the story.  Thematically, it didn't quite make sense that the bottle could still go to someone else when all cards in a hand were higher than the current trick, though. I also didn't love the artwork on cards and wish they would have told a better progression of the story.

An interesting twist of the traditional trick taking mechanism. There is a threshold which splits the deck in two; you can win over it and you can win under it. Winning under it though can be dangerous; you can get stuck with the bottle imp and that means you loose the hand massively. A seemingly lightweight game, it does require your focus, especially in remembering numbers which have been played.

I love this game, and have never tired of it.  It's rare to find a great game specifically designed for three players.  The four player game is great as well.

Very clever trick taking game that works well with three players. Theme fits very well. This is a deeper game tham appears on first play. All plays so far with the first edition - I don't know how much the changes in the second edition impact it. Update - now played about 20 games with the new edition. I prefer the point distribution in the new version. The game's not losing its appeal at all. Can see a lot of play in this one yet.

This one needs some more plays to be adequately rated.  I currently have it at a six (after one play).  There is a strategy, I think.  We played several hands which seemed to be repetetive.

I discovered this game a year ago just some time before the release and longed for it a while. Then on my birthday, my girl, bought my a copy to appease my redneck-side.

As an Ameritrash patriarch this game evolves during the play as it is expected to be: lots of plastic army men, (hoover)tanks, APCs, choppers, B-2 Spirit, partisans and dice. 

Though the mechanics even if pretty solid and neat does not shine for outstanding, the game bring in some of the greatest awesomeness of late. Being the yankee or the commies is I suppose the main asset of the game, if that does not appeal to you, you better not even give a try. 

The mood indeed for the play ought, must, be the same of Red Dawn or Invasion USA, briefly: '80s Reaganian US attitude to the rest od the world. It seems I drift politically, but hey heck this cannot be a game about mocking reality as it could be?!?

Anyway as I said for an improved version of Risk it delivers a lot more! The sense of battling the enemy invader "on the beaches, on the landing grounds, in the fields and in the streets, and never surrender" is heavily strong as US player. The partisans deck give a sense of unpredictability and surprise tipical of a scenario like that: you can feel the sensation of a would be Pentagon four star brass trying to meet ends with the scarcity of weapons materiels and personnel and hopes for the best and citizen uprise for freedom. In this sense the fluff of the partisans' card is really awesome. 

On the other side the invaders can please themselves with the possibility of knocking out the once been hyperpower. And they get their fair load of fluff on the invasion player cards that I really suggest to implement in every game. As they try to do what partisan deck do for US, now for the commies.

All in all the best part of the game that I like is the sense of uncertainty, susoense and weavering of every round of game. Really enjoyable and engaging even if not the perfect wargame. A well deserved top mark! 10

A great game re-released and slightly improved from the classic 1980s version.  Lots of tension in this one, and I love playing a modern wargame on a map of the USA.  The stakes feel so much higher when Atlanta or Seattle is surrounded and fighting to the last man, as opposed to Okinawa or Normandy.

Played the 80s version when I was a fresh teenager, so I can't remember precisely how the rules vary, but I do dig this futuristic story/upgrade, and it's still a pretty fun light war game with asymmetrical play. I wouldn't advise playing with 3 and having one person control 2 of the Invader armies. Go 2 or 4 on this one. I also prefer the use of the cards for the Invaders. Anyway, great stuff.

Likes:
   - I still find the combat system very intense and enjoyable even though it might be a bit dated.
   - The new board is amazing.  I also am a huge fan of the new mini's.
   - Game felt more balanced than the previous version from that map layout

Dislikes:
   - I knew this going in, but the game has a TON of downtime for the invader players.
   - If the US player makes key stands, the game can take a very long time to complete.
   - The new story line is pretty terrible compared to the one from the 80's, but in this day of age I'm sure people would of complained about a story like the old one to not be politically correct.

Notes:
   - Game did bring back lots of dice rolling memories from when i was a kid playing this game.

This reprint is weird. This is a game that made sense in the 80s, when we were going through a bout of Reagan-fuelled communist paranoia, and movies like Red Dawn were making the rounds. Today, Fortress America is just a cultural artifact, a reminder of this very strange place we were in culturally at that time. Since then the game has gone from reflecting something real about where some people were to just being this weird thing. I have no idea why FFG would think it worth reprinting (it's not a very good game either). I can only imagine it appealing to serious fans of the original, and those hardcore plastic-lovers who want to actively thumb their noses at the ideals of good game design.

RATING: 8
The game is actually a lot of fun to play.  The issues I have with it are:
1. The movement rules are written in a very confusing manner.
2. The spaces on the board are too small to hold all the units.
3. The rules in general are written in a very confusing manner.

I should probably rate this higher because I can see that there is a good Risk-like game here that would reward repeated play.  It just that I'm bored with Risk and games closely resembling Risk these days.  It also seemed like it could play a lot longer than the 2-3 hours stated playtime. On a minor note, I did find moving your units around the board a little fiddly and annoying.  The game has excellent asymmetry though.

I am not familiar with the original game from 1986; nice game of conquering areas; unlike in many other games one player clearly is the attacker and 1 is the defender; in some areas the map will be quite full; I have read many complaints about the rulebook, but it is clear to me; considerable downtime, but good that both players throw dice in a battle

RATING: 5
Fortress America has a good setup and looks like it should flow well.  While I like some of the things they are trying to do, it failed to execute.  The rules could use some help, which does not help.  They slow down advancement so much that I think they limit tactical moves.  So it just ends up being too much focus in certain sections of the map.  Interesting to be exposed to, but there are much better options out there.

Suffers from unbalanced players, a long setup time, and ambiguous rules.  The US is at the mercy of the Partisan deck, so you don't really get a lot of decisions other than the starting positions.  The theme is awesome but doesn't make up for the short comings.  It's not worth the 3-4 hours you'll spend on it.  Although it can be argued that everyone needs to try it at least once, just because of it's place in gaming history.

Sadly I never played the older Milton Bradley version of this game. I wasn't expecting I'd like this, but there's a great fun factor. It's so charming and retro, jsut the simple fun of standing up your guys and then knocking them down. It's a bit harsh on rules to slow the invasion pace, so the grind factor is higher than i'd prefer. There's virtually no way to make sudden surgical strikes or pocket enemies.

The first time I played this one (the 1st edition) in Memphis, TN, back in 1986, boy what a session that was! I had taken control of the Soviet faction. The session had everything, from tension and swearing, to kicking the shit out of the guy playing the Asian faction for cheating in favour of the guy playing the U.S., as if his lasers were not enough. Nevertheless, we managed to complete the game with a different Asian player and a victory for the coalition.

I am not sure we played this correctly as the general concensus is that this game is heavily 'balanced' in favour of America, however when we played the American player was crushed by turn 4 having had no impact in the game at all really.
 
It felt very much like if the game had been developed by fantasy flight in recent years the America side would have been an AI deck (like the locus is gears of war) as the player actually playing America has their hands very much tied as they cannot really plan. Reinforcements are random and can therefore be useless, initial set up is very very restrictive. In all the only real decision the America player seems to have was where to place the lasers and where to shoot them each turn. 

Traded in a math trade (2014) for Space Cadets.

I appreciate what this game is trying to do with the asymmetrical tempo (one of my favorite dynamics in games), where USA needs to weather the initial invasion surge and strike at the occasional supply line or weakly held cities, then let the lasers and reinforcements build up into an eventual juggernaut (around midway through the game). On the invasion side, it's about surrounding and holding towns and accumulating territory, balancing expansion with defensible holdings. Their lost units never return to the board, so the land grab inevitably slows as troop expenditure becomes more considered. 

All of this sounds fun enough, but it takes [b]hours[/b] to play through, with tons of down time between turns due to the sheer number of units to shove around and the multi-tiered combat (for both defense and offense, which means roughly 3-6 roll-offs with [i]each[/i] battle). I think this should only be played as two-player, and even then I'm not sure I could endure it, especially since none of the invaders really interact or overlap in their operations, so playing the invader would feel very repetitive. I like the strategy, but I'd just as soon play War of the Ring, a much richer game, for 3 hours than sit through this game again. 

This has become the emblem of what doesn't work for me on the Ameritrash spectrum. Playing stuff like this for hours is what placed the pejorative emphasis on "trash" until it was re-appropriated. Fortunately, along with that re-appropriation, most designs have matured and moved on from this style. I certainly won't miss it.

whe can say, a good representative of possible WWIII scenario that put's us in a decision by the US that put the world's peace and discussion at the brink of the tension, causing the war that here is proposed. it's a semi cooperative game. infact, one player will be the US with a great power, the use of the mighty laser wepons whic caused the war and of course, the advantage to battle in theyr own country while being helped even by milizias created by American civilians. on the other side up to 3 players will be the appointed generals of the 3 main factions created(the eastern european new communism, the eurasian coalition and the central american coalition)who are trying to besiege the us, forcing the americans to destroy their laser defence project and pay a huge fee for the chaos they created. trough the game turns, the us player creates it's defence while the attackers mantaining supply lanes, go deep in the States trying to conquer the more territory they can forcing eventually the cease fire of the USA. A board game best played by all 4 players

RATING: 6
It's basically Axis & Allies, except the invasion is against America.  I was disappointed in the lack of depth and strategy in this one.  However, defending Los Angeles against Asia, New Orleans against South America and DC against Europe, all at the same time, was a memorable experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a fun Risk/Axis & Allies type game, that's a lot of fun to play with 4 players. I'm not sure how well it plays with less. It's a long game, but a fun one that kept us all engaged the entire time.

There's a lot of cool components, that come with the game and they all work well with it. One player is trying to defend the USA, while the other three countries are attacking from all sides and trying to take over for themselves and the win.

This is not a light game and may not be for everyone, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.

Great game. Had alot of fun playing it. However, some of the rules and terms are unclear. 

Heads up: The game lists "maneuver" and "invasion" movements. Really this is "pre-battle" movement, followed by combat, ending with "post combat" movement. So when the game rules read "Infantry have an invasion movement of 1," what it really means is that after the combat phase infantry have a movement of one. So infantry can only move before combat if they are accompanied by a personnel carrier, then they can attack adjacent tiles, then they can move 1 space after all combats have concluded.

Ultimately I just think Axis & Allies is a far better game.  Much of that is because A&A has been continuously refined over the years and this is just the first attempt to do that with Fortress America (which was never considered as good as Axis & Allies even back then).  Too many other games of this type to keep this one around even if I would play it again.

In Fortress America, the United States must defend itself from three deadly invading armies: the Asian People's Alliance from the West, the Central American Federation from the South, and the Euro-Socialist Pact from the East. Players take on either the role of the United States, struggling to protect itself from foreign threat, or the role of one or more of the invading armies, fighting battle after battle to acquire important territories.

First play of this was just 2 player, I played the invader, got a little tiring doing everything over and over for 3 turns in a row. Rating would probably go up if/when played with a full compliment of 4 players.

RATING: 4
Needs a different initiative system as losing early on as the invaders is almost an automatic loss. Something like, as soon as the invaders don't take more cities than the US takes back. 
And the opening of the gulf coast should depend on US points or something and not on a die roll [second roll was successful and US was toast].
Also not a fan of the US throwing dice points.
Would try again with house rules.

RATING: 4
Rating based on 4 players.

The description of this game made me think it would be like an ameritrash version of Friedrich, and it kinda is, except less satisfying in every way. It's not that the game mechanics are terrible, it's your standard fight-and-roll, it's just that I found it boring, which is the worst thing for an ameritrash game to be. There didn't seem to be much room for maneuvering, there's no economy, the map felt unbalanced between factions (red had too much to do, yellow too little), and I found the American reinforcement via cards weird. It just felt uneven.

It is not a terrible game, and the reason I rate it this low is that it also took 4+ hours to play (much of that being downtime; and, unlike Friedrich, what happens between other players will not affect you 99% of the time). If it was a shorter game, I'd be more forgiving.

Yeah, it’s old school fun. I never played the original, but I hear this revised does fix a few things. I like old school A&A and this had the same feel, which is good. And also bad. 

That’s because there’s apparently just a handful of real strategy options for each side. Also, the West/Yellow player seems bored for the most part (like the US in A&A for much of the game). And really it’s a 2pl game (like A&A). Though the dice luck are mitigated (here by type of die rolled vs unit), it still comes down to dice. Specifically, early vs late laser hits is huge. 

That is, if on your 1st 2 turns as US, you get 3 laser shots. By turn 3 this is 6 shots. If you hit the 1st 3 and miss the next 3, this is far better than miss the 1st 3 and hit the next 3. The next big point is how the dice go for Red in DC and/or ATL. 

The reinforcement cards are random too, and it can be odd how they play in. I see what they were going for, but it’s just a bit much. 

Overall it’s fun, but not as fun as A&A. The combat and tension is there, yes, especially if the early turns went well for the bad guys. I think the variants add some fun and fix some things, but it’s still a long game, so be wary there.

I did buy this one. The usual. FFG festival of plastic. Nicer bits, though what they might describe as "detail" I'd call overt fussiness. As usual, the cards are overdone. Wish they'd do something cleaner for once, but that's not the house style.

Thanks to the remake, another one down, I've thought I never gonna have the chance to play... Hearing all the high praise, I always wondered that the flagship of Ameritrash is all about patriotism, or there's an actual game in there. Yep, it's there. Not being an American, without any emotional attachment to either side, the game still flies. Using the same units, but separating the sides asymmetrically to Invader and Defender roles is the most appealing feature here, and it's almost as if all of our played games are not about the current one, but a run-down in practice of what should be one do different next time... I expected more tactics and less strategy; a pleasant surprise.

Terrible design. Boring and repetitive. Game belongs back in the 80's and shouldn't have had a reprint as there is just nothing to it. You move bits of plastic and then roll dice to see what happens.
American player has zero choice over what troops to build and where, it is just decided by random card draw.
Board is not big enough for the units, making it an incredibly fiddly game. Nobody enjoyed it, we just rolled dice for 3 hours and then put it away.

Based on one play: All the countries are invading the USA. The main idea works well, one man has to fight off all the attackers.

They did a nice job with this new version.  However, this was a chance to even up the sides and I do not think it was done. In fact it may be worse with the new cards for the invaders.  It is very hard in the original version for America to win unless you use some balancing factors like making reinforcements arrive at 5 units over 8 turns and giving America extra lasers.  This was an opportunity to balance the sides and I do not think that was done.

My current favorite beer & pretzel modern war board game.  Light on rules but heavy on strategy.  I liked the 1986 version too, but did not regret replacing it with this one.

The new board corrected some of the border glitches on the previous one (however, I liked the colors on the older board better).

The game pieces are excellent (the older version ones were excellent too, so I kept them).

The rules are clear.

2 player games can last 3-5 intense hours (6 to 10 turns).

One minor point:  

Invader cards are unbalanced for the 2 player game where both of them are experienced players.  Some of them are just to powerful and paralyze the USA player's defense (like "No Laser usage this turn," "No partisan cards this turn," or "Invader gets 3-4 of their destroyed bombers back").  I would suggest not using them in this case.

However, in a 2 player game with an experienced USA player vs. a new Invader player, the Invader cards are a great training tool, as they help mitigate critical errors made (this game is known to be loved by modern war buffs, but hated by more casual gamers, because mistakes tend to be unforgiving).  Once the new invader player learns to beat the USA player when using the cards, drop them and play the game again for the ultimate challenge.

The invader cards would probably also help in a 4 player game where the invaders were inexperienced.  I have not played beyond the 2 player game but I did play the 1986 version with 4 players.

Would I play it again and again?  Absolutely.  Would I buy it again?  Already bought 2 copies!

Is it perfect? No.  Like most light strategy games, the die roll is as important as strategy.  Also, there are some nitpicky issues I have with the layout of the rulebook and the minimal examples of play.
All in all though, just as the original was my favorite of the old MB games, this is now my favorite FFG game. Everything I loved about the original, some balanced rules tweaks, and excellent production quality... what's not to love?

Update: 2nd play, still fun! Invaders rolled well (especially yellow) and America had some rounds taking heavy losses while not inflicting many at all, but the game was tense and really enjoyable!

A game which has an amazing 'arc'. I've only experienced the US side - but it's really got the 'desperate fight for every city' slowly giving way to the 'counter-attack as your lasers come on-line'.

An improved version of one of the best games of all times.  In fact the original really needed no improvements, but this does in a number of ways - more card options, updated units sculpts, an alternate city and back story (although granted this may only appeal if you have both versions.) This game was and is very high in fun factor, strategy, balanced tension, numerous paths to victory for both sides, and replay-ability.

The epitome of Ameritrash, with a strong distinctive character and some interesting tactical and strategic choices.

Sorry to get political here, but this game concept is so weird.

Considering it's the USA who do have military bases accross the World, it's not the "rest of the World" who wants to invade the USA. Historically, it's the opposite.
Mexico, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Panama, Cuba, Haiti, Vietnam, Cambodia, Nicaragua, Irak, Afghanistan and all the others CIA interventions that are too numerous to keep track of.

Maybe this game has good mechanics, but the whole concept looks like an american ultranationalist-imperialist propaganda add. "Fortress Iran" or "Fortress Cuba", countries that are somehow under siege, would make more sense...

Good game, but the invaders don't need any more help than they did in the first game. If anything, the Americans need more help. There are options included to achieve that, but the new rules as they stand changes the dice rules for the partisans. You used to be able to role 8 sided for an area that was full of partisans. Now it's only if it's one unit by itself. That change is significant!

[thing=99][/thing] is a game from a time when the US still feared the communist and socialist wave that, by the mid-80, was more like a stubborn wash on the feet. The theme is: the US finished its defense system, composed by a powerful laser cannons network guided by satellites - the "Star Wars" system. The rest of the world considered this as an act of war, and thus a massive invasion on the US begun. Who are attacking? Well, the socialist european, the communist asians and the latins. So cute.

[thing=99][/thing] is a step beyond [thing=181][/thing], being much whealtier in options. Each invader army is composed by 5 units: infantry, vehicles, hovertanks, helicopters and bombers; and among them there are differences in movement and attack - infantry and vehicles have a 50% chance to hit, tanks and helicopters have 5 chances in 8 to hit, and bombers have 7 chances in 10 to hit. Regarding movement: infantry, vehicles and tanks move 1 space (infantry only moves in the invasion step of the player turn if by its one), helicopters move up to 2 spaces and bombers move up to 4 spaces - but bombers can't take cities or regions by themselves. The US has these same units, and also: Partisans, that fight harder when alone, and, of course, the Lasers - each of them can hit one unit anywhere in the board on a 5+ in a d10. A new laser appears for the US player to use every round - only one laser can be use on a given place.

The objective of the US is to resist for 10 rounds without losing 18 cities to the invaders; the objective of the invaders is to take at least 18 cities and hold them until the end of the US turn. There is a way to count points in the end, if the invaders won, to see which of them was to top invader, but this option seemed odd to us and unbalanced, because, depending on the cards the US player draws, one or other force can suffer severely to take cites, and this is out of the control of the invader player. So we played without it.

By the end of the game, [thing=99][/thing] proved itself to be a game more on the lighter side of rules (we only have some problems to get used to a few restrictions for movement). The match was fun, but it must be said that luck plays a huge part in the game, so some frustrations may arise during the game. The duration is also a point to be noticed: our play ended in the 4th round (of 10) and the clock showed it lasted for about 150 minutes. Knowing the game probably won't make the time of play drop, since it will probably take more rounds to win (in our play the US player made some mistakes, so by round 4 the invaders ended up with 19 cities).

The game bits are many and the miniatures uses the same mold for every type of unit - there is no different minis between the armies, only colors.

A final word to the wise: if you are going to try this one out, use the invaders cards, because they give the players not only more options, but they requirements make some regions worth to hold almost as much as cities. They also can make cool things happen - like turning Seattle to New Manchuria!

Haven't played since I was a kid.

Bought the new version on nostalgia - played with four - and realized I still love this game as much as when I was a kid.

Half way through the game we weren't quite sure who was really 'winning'.  Had to stop since we started late and it is long - esp when relearning.

Love the partisan deck and the invader decks - all really seems balanced thus far.

Little slow when not your turn but not bad.  A winner  

Yeah - it's a bit of a nostalgia rating but tough ;-)

Well, as an introductory/gateway game to the wonderful world of wargaming, FA decently depicts a desperate defence scenario, against rampaging hordes. It's not that it's not enjoyable, but it's a bit clunky and essentially for the american player it's like playing 3 different 2vs2 games. There's scant interaction between the invaders.

And don't play with the Invader cards. They seriously unbalance the game.

RATING: N/A
Odd reprint choice, but it's a great game and deserves to be available. It's old-school, but the downtime isn't too bad (if invaders play in parallel), and it's got a lot of solid, angsty choices to make along the way.

I wish that FFG had gone a bit further with changes, and one change (the turn limit victory) is irrelevant (game should--hell, can--never go that long). The partisan deck could've used an overhaul (gaming the deck is not a virtue). 

I'm still unsettled by the Buffalo/Colorado Springs and Kansas City/Las Vegas swap. It implies non-cooperative invaders (a 4p free for all), which is bad for scalability (if it's better for that, 2p will be dreadfully imbalanced toward the invaders). New transport rule seems fine to me, with an edge to the invaders. The optional rules can always be used to tweak balance perceptions, but I'm skeptical about the game without them at this point. Still, will likely acquire soon, as it's an old favorite and I still play it off and on.

This version has done what I thought would be impossible by improving on the original.  They have added some variations and chaged up a couple cities to freshen up the game as well as balance the invader position.  I loved playing the original in high school (right after Red Dawn came out).  Some of the most memorable games were, when as America, you got the "Commies" to attack each other because there can only be "one winner". Also, you gotta love a game with the NRA partisan card.  So in summary.... Wolverines!!!!!

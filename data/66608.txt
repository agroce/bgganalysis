What can I say about Two by Two. You just dig into a pile of sand and try to find two matching tokens. That is about it, if you simplify things enough. There is some tactics involved (especially with the advanced scoring rules) since not all moves yield equal points. Sometimes you can even block others. And this is the game there is in Two by Two. You are basically trying to spot the the best opportunities and seize them. Luck can help things a lot, though.

For some weird reason the game in all its simplicity is some fun. You dig and dig, and you see the game progress towards the inevitable end. Two by Two is by no means a great game nor performs particularly well in any aspect. But there are no major flaws either.

I have played this online only, but can imagine that in a live game managing all the tokens can be a real pain in the ass.

A fantastic family game that can even be played with really young kids (suggested 8+, I played it with a 7-year old). Rules are very accessible and the game's components look really good. The board is great and the animal chips/ tiles are of decent quality (could have been thicker). Overall a great choice to play with young kids.

[ESP] Mmmmm. Lo compré sabiendo que era un juego más bien orientado a niños pero se suponía que la puntuación avanzada lo hacía mejor. Efectivamente hace que sea "ok", pero eso nomás.
Mi idea era tenerlo como filler pero l influencia en la suerte de los animales que uno tenga cercanos es bastante. Creo que tengo juegos mejores para ocaciones en que haya poco tiempo.
Probablemente lo conservaré como una opción para niños, pero nada más...

Rather uninteresting game where you just go through the motions until the game is finished. No meaningful decisions and almost completely random. A real childrens game and the theme and artwork places it firmly in that segment. Not something I want to play, not at all.

A nice family game which, to me, is marred a little by having slightly too much complexity in the movement and scoring for a true family game, whilst not having enough complexity to be a gamers game.

The theme is very nice though, and the gradual flooding of the island as you move round rescuing animals is quite satisfying.

RATING: 5
Only played on Yucata.de.  Keep in mind I haven't played it much so take what I saw with a grain of salt.  They are just initial observations.

It seems in a three-player game that it is easy for two players to team up against the other.  The search for animals encourages one to drill a river into the island, but a player gets more points for placing water tiles next to more existing water tiles.  So two players working together can create an extra-wide river that will earn more points than someone going it alone.  You choose at the beginning where your ark starts, and you can't move great distances, so in a three-player game if the third player decides to place his ark near to someone else's, these two will earn more points building off of each other and leave the odd man out to try to eke out some points alone.  I consider this a flaw, but I haven't played it much so I may be off base.  I don't expect this problem would exist in 2- or 4-player games.

The decisions seem fairly automatic, the game practically plays itself, but I really like the publisher's decisions on presentation, artwork, and layout -- a real win there, in my opinion.  I would consider buying it as a kids game, when my kid gets older.

Beautiful artwork, colorful board, and especially excellent accessibility for non-gamers, I was finally pleased to see this one fully accepted by my wife and close friends.  I did mess up on the advanced scoring which only means this game will even get better on our next play.
 
I must remember that each species gets a total of 6 points irregardless of how many pairs are rescued.
 
I also ordered Nerf suction darts to aid in tile pickup. Stubby adult fingers just don't cut it.

RATING: 6
Competing arks try to collect as many animal pairs as possible, while also spreading the floodwaters further for more points.

Played at ConnCon 2013.  This is a more advanced children's game that I played with another father to test for his 4 year old.  The basic game seems like it may be too much for a child that young, because the only thing basic is the scoring.  The game turn actions are a bit more complicated.  The advanced game just adds advanced, end game scoring.  Still, not bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game for the family.  First play (4 player with basic rules) went OK -- enjoyable, but nothing special.  Second play with 2 players and advanced rules was MUCH better.  Not sure if that was because we already knew the game or because the 2-player experience is that much better.  I suspect it's a bit of both.

Note:  Trying to flip the round tokens without upsetting the rest of the board is next to impossible.  Save your sanity and toss a couple of Nerf suction-cup darts into the box - they work GREAT.

The theme here is cleverly woven in to give players a better grasp on the abstract strategy that lies underneath.  You move your ark around the board, slowly flooding the land, and as you do, animal tiles are revealed.  Find a pair and you can claim it, but you also score when flooding an area that's near other water tiles.

It's definitely a simplistic game that would work well with kids, so opt for the "advanced scoring" which values the animal tiles based on their rarity at the end of the game.  This adds a bit more strategy as you consider removing an animal from the board after you have a pair in that type.

There's some potential fun here, but I don't see myself playing it a lot.

Not only is this a great kids game, but it's also a lot of fun, for the adults to. Put the two together and it's an excellent family game.

It's a light game and easy to learn, but don't let that fool you. It's got a nice exploration mechanic, along with some screw you neighbor tactics.

The components look nice, but it can be a little fiddly, during game play and setting up all the tokens, at game starts takes a little while, but it's surely worth it.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2011)

I played Two by Two a long time ago, but I played it Face to Face for the first time last week. It is a gorgeous, well produced game, however it is uber simple, even with the advanced scoring rules. It also has lots of uncontrollable luck. I think the game is great for little children, but I don’t like it at all, it´s just not my cup of tea.

On the good side you have very little to consider each turn, so it flows quickly and the play time is generally short. I think this is best played with 2.

Perhaps I will play it again on Yucata, as I need more games to continue advancing my rank, other than that I don’t plan to play it again.

Sadly enough this might be the best "Noah's Ark" inspired game I've played.

The game has you flood an island, thus flushing out different cartoon animals. Get them to score points but beware opponents collecting the same kind of animal since this will mean you have to divide the score. Then you also have to balace the flood mechanic between scoring points and creating pathways or flushing out new animals.

RATING: 7
An interesting game with lots of cute animals (kudos to the artist), that has a small tactical element to it. The mechanism is simple, lots of tiles face down on your turn place a water tile which may turn face up some of theses tiles to reveal animals then 2 actions which may be move one space or rescue a PAIR of animals by being adjacent to one of them. The game continues until all water is played or all animals rescued. You score during the game for water placement and at the end for animals saved. The tactics are around area control and whether or not to reveal animals or collect points for sea placement. The game is quite luck based which may even out through a game - or not, but does it matter because it is a fun game and did I mention the cute animals?

This is a fine, if very light, family game and this game isn't really built up my alley.  There is a slight decision point between drowning animals to keep your opponent(s) from collecting types of animals and what you collect/and set up as your own path for your ark to travel upon. Animals are randomly set out and are unknown until they are next to water.

Only tried with 2 players.  I think the advanced rules (sharing 6 points per animal) makes it more challenging and cutthroat, as you have to choose between drowning and sharing animals to stay ahead on points.  I like that for the 2 moves per turn you have to decide between exposing more animals, going for during-game points (water), leaving one animal to risk looking for more.  Would love to try with more players but happy with 2 as a tight game.

RATING: 7.5
Great family game where players each have an ark and are collecting sets of animals.  One could say it's a modern version of Knizia's Africa but different enough to try out.  Competitive players looking for a light filler should also enjoy this and I expect it would play as well with 2 as with 3 or 4.

On a player's turn one first floods any land spot, with or without an animal on it, that's connected to water.  You score points for how many water tiles are connected to the new water tile and then any adjacent animals on land are flipped over and revealed.  Next the player has two actions: a) move his/her ark to an adjacent water space b) collect a set of animals.  Animals can only be collected in sets and one only needs to have his/her ark adjacent to one of the two animals in the set.  You don't have to perform both actions you can move twice or collect twice if you wish.  

There is basic and advanced scoring options but basically you get bonuses for collecting certain animals that your ark prefers and if you're the one to have that animal in your ark you'll get more points.  There are 3 sets of each animals tile except for the rare unicorn which only has one set.  2011-06-13

UPDATE: Advanced scoring "may" allow more swings of luck but at the same time make for a more strategic game.

Two by Two is a clearly a game aimed at families. A simple and solid design that works well within its basic structure. It certainly is engaging for youngsters and very attractive and eye catching. For adults, I think that it has limited appeal and not a lot of staying power except as a short and light filler. However, I do think that it is not strong enough to stand out as a memorable gaming experience. There just isn't a lot to it. But having said that, its not meant to be more than it is and as a simple and fun family game it does the job.

A light family game where players control arks to manuever around a sinking island to pick up animal pairings.  Every turn you can move, add a water tile, and pick up an animal.  Different animals are worth different amount of points, you also can gain points by clever placing of water tiles.

For what it is, this game is fun and I hope to play it with my daughter one day.

RATING: 5
A very family game with not much to it. The first step is to expand the water inland. This will typically reveal tiles with animals on them. Then you have two actions to either move and/or claim any animal next to your ship if there's a duplicate anywhere else on the island, which you also claim. So you drive inland, carving off territory if you can (a la Africa) so opponents have less options and then aim to get lucky with your animal revelations, getting as many pairs as you can. Maybe some turns you might drown animals that an opponent is about to collect. But otherwise the decisions are fairly trivial and the game is procedural. Whilst it may go down ok in a non-gamer family setting, it's, well, average.

Easy to learn and understand, and I really like that the designer went for an interesting scoring scheme, which adds interesting strategies and tactics to the game.

This one was a joy to design. Like all Noah-themed games, it began as a memory game. Thankfully it quickly evolved down a different and more interesting path. I consider it an excellent gateway game - simple enough that it can be played by families but with enough meat that it wouldn't be out of place in a convention tournament. I'd estimate the weight to be about 1.5 - similar to Keltis or Hey! That's My Fish, a little bit lighter than Zooloretto.

Played a 2 player game of this on its release weekend.  Easy to learn, Two by Two looks and feels lighthearted, but under the hood there's lots of room for strategy, and even some cutthroat play.  The game can be lighter, for play with kids or as a family game, but I suspect that with a group of gamers this could be very intense, with lots of hard decisions.  

There is a bit of fiddliness in set up due to the animal tokens, but we found that it did not get in the way of gameplay at all.  If I were playing it with kids however, I might put the game board on a non-slip surface for extra insurance (I don't feel that the tiles are any more prone to being moved about than the Settlers of Catan).

Like [b]Survive[/b], [b]Hey! That's My Fish![/b], or [b]Vineta[/b], the game involves an ever-shrinking board.

Scoring system is the most interesting aspect of the game with each player having a set of animals only they can score bonus points on, the fact that you can "steal" points away from another player by acquiring the same set of animals that they have, purposely "drowning" animals to secure your monopoly on animal types, etc.

Only complaint: movement seems limited and players often stay in their own areas of the board. However, it's not a deal-breaker; the decisions always remain meaningful and interesting.

I will pull this out frequently with family, but perhaps not with my euro and ameritrash-gaming friends... but that's not what the audience the game is addressing.

It was an enjoyable experience and I'd like to have a copy sometime.  *Update* - have since acquired a copy and after a few plays, there's just not as much fun here as I originally thought.  What's worse is the kids aren't enjoying it -- perhaps too abstract for them?

Oh, it's a sweet little puppy!  Did you want to rescue the sweet little puppy?  Yeah, PUPPY F**KING DROWNS.

Good game for kids?  Absolutely: trivial to learn, delightful theme, plays in half an hour.  

But don't let the little cartoon animals, kid-friendly theme, and simple gameplay fool you -- this game is a vicious, cutthroat, screw-your-neighbourfest.  For all its simplicity, it cleverly balances tactical choices each turn, and can make for very tense decisions.  The strategic advantage of screwing your opponents is intrinsically promoted by the advanced scoring system, and becomes immediately apparent to any seven-year-old, who will immediately and gleefully DROWN ALL YOUR PUPPIES.

Decent, not great family game. Wouldn't mind playing occasionally, I guess ... but not my thing.

I gave this a 9 primarily because my 5 year old adores the game.  I like the theme, the artwork, the simple and intuitive mechanics.  There's nothing difficult to learn about this game--therefore it's perfect for families.  

The scoring is a bit weird, but it could be simplified further for young children.  I like that the scoring was Ticket to Ride-ish.  You build a base score and then there's a final scoring push at the end--a massive scoring push.

My little guy, Noah (haha), was focused on this game for the full 55 minutes we played.  He needed help, but by 1/2 way through he was really seeing possibilities and loved collecting stacks of animals.  I was even able to teach him a bit of multiplication because of the 2x scoring of certain animals.

His face was why I gave it a 9.  He won, in the end, and was ecstatic.  

Reminds me of Survive! mixed with TTR and a touch of abstract euro.  The theme feels a bit pasted, but it works and adds a whimsical finish to the game.

A surprisingly solid offering from Valley Games. The game play and theme mesh together very well, and, while the game is fairly simple, there are still some tough choices to be made. The only real downside here for me is that this sort of game invites king-making and the luck factor is pretty high. Likely to be an excellent game for families.

Played over on yucata.  Simple game, good for kids.  Once you're familiar with the mechanics it is predominantly luck based, with a small allowance for tactical skill.

A light family game.  An easy to teach gateway game.  At the time of this writing my light/casual family-gamer friends are starting to consider games for their 4yr old daughter.  Though suggested for 8+, younger children may be able to play with supervision/assistance.

Rated as a children's game. Fun for the kids to save the animals from drowning and the graphics are awesome for kids. Our 5yo son can play it, although he still likes to ask daddy for advice with his turns...

Talk about a "what-if?" scenario.  What if God didn't say Noah build an ark, I'll send animals for you to rescue, and save your family.  What if instead He said, "Noah, Bill, Chuck, and Joe build arks.  Whoever saves the most animals will also save his family."

I can see this one getting cut throat, with drowning animals, amongst seasoned gamers

Played with my wife, who is a non-gamer and was skeptical of playing any of my hobby games. She had a blast. Rating is high because it is a great game for what it is: A relatively simple, entry level board game with a light and fun theme that anyone can enjoy. Would recommend this to anyone who wants a family game that takes less than an hour to play and is even good with just 2 players.

When played with the basic scoring rules, this works well as a family game and should work well as a gateway game.  As a gamers game, I can see the advanced scoring rules adding a different layer of strategy.  I can also see more strategic animal drowning in a non-family gaming session.  

I was a little confused about the staggered start on points (first player starts on one, second on two, third on three).  This would infer that the start player has an advantage over the last player.  I don't see that.  Each player gets to choose their start location before any animals are revealed.  In addition, if all the water tokens are used the last player gets last play which could be an advantage of capitalizing on recently uncovered animal pairs.  A different way to balance this out could be if the game ends on condition two, i.e. not everyone gets equal turns, then each player is awarded one point per position from the last player.  That is to say that if player two ended the game, player three would gain one point and player four two points.  Another variant that may justify this is that no scoring tokens can reside on the same spot during the game.  Thus, when player one scores his first points, he will jump ahead of the last player.

In conclusion, the game is a bit fiddly with the counter grabbing and flipping, but a solid design and has a place in my collection.  It is a light strategy game suitable for families and non-gamers.  I also think that the game could be enjoyed by gamers who like a little more out of their games.  The components are respectable, but the large box leaves something to be desired.

Using the basic scoring, it's a great family game where my kids can be competitive due to the luck element and the easy to grasp strategies. With the advanced scoring, it becomes a game of challenging and cut-throat tactical decisions. Fun!

[b]Basic Scoring[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] Easy enough, but I'm pretty darn sure that the "advanced" scoring is what makes this game more interesting to play.

In either case, it's a fairly opportunistic game.

Haz avanzar el agua y revela los animales adyacentes. Luego tienes 2 Puntos de Accion que puedes usar para moverte y recolectar parejas de animales. Algunas parejas son más valiosas para tu arca que para las otras.

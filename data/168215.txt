Not fun.  Too random, but yet enough strategy to mean it's basically Chutes and Ladders in card form.  Except limited to 2 players.

I love games that can be played solo. When I learn more about it, I will update my mark of this game. I own it now. It's a funny game. And challenging! I want to play it with my wife to feel its essence.

This falls flat as a solo game: it is way too dependent on luck. Especially the removal of ten random cards at the start of each round can be very annoying. The game play needs interaction to be any fun.

As a two-player game, it is better, but the premise remains rather boring.

Oddly the dual version with 2 players takes longer than the original with many more. Much more strategic with 2 players and the new cards/rules. A blast to play!

RATING: 4
SOLD IT! ($3)

This game captures the flavor of the original almost verbatim, though somehow managed to take an OK game and make it worse. As a tactical experience, it really just runs itself... play bad cards on opponent, play cards to trump these bad cards, move to treasure, etc. It all just boils down to who draws what and once someone gets ahead on points, they can simply make it impossible for anyone else to catch up. The other annoying aspect, is it is another game that extends itself by replaying several games in succession, where each mini game has zero connection to the previous.

It is just filler on the level of flipping cards to see who draws higher, but with the visual appeal of a map. Blech.

I liked the "Carcassonne"-style gameplay of the original "Saboteur", but I'm not a fan of games with hidden traitors, and it had balance problems. The idea of a two-player version really appealed to me, but, sadly, this is a huge disappointment.

The broken-equipment cards are an unwelcome inheritance of the parent game and completely ruin the experience. They worked well there, with the secret roles. Here, with a single opponent, they are pointless and utterly annoying. They bring no interesting decisions. If you draw one, you just play it, no reason to hold it. If you have them played against you, either you have a card to counter it or you don't. If you don't, you may either discard any two cards and play the rest of the round with a reduced hand or pass and hope to draw one of the few corresponding repair cards. Guess which option is always chosen! In the end, the broken equipment cards only serve to make you miss your turn and discard useful path cards, whereas their counters often clutter your hand, as you don't want to discard them for fear of receiving a broken equipment.

Luck of the draw is another big problem, with gold nuggets to be found along the way and not much gold in the goal cards (some even with zero gold), which are very difficult to reach. Since cards with gold are claimed and kept by the players until the end of the game for scoring, if a player gets most of those path cards in the first round, he probably already won. And there are also cards that benefit a specific player. These don't bother me so much but definitely contribute to the luck factor.

I tried the game again without the broken equipment and repair cards, and it was much better. However, the game as designed is terrible and seems poorly playtested.

Aki az eredeti játékot annyira szereti, hogy még kettesben is azt játszaná, annak jó választás lehet. Szerintem teljesen rendben van a játékmenet, egyszerű, gyors, vannak benne döntési helyzetek és lehetőségek is. Azért nem szabad komolyan venni. :)
Mindenesetre a kétfős kártyajátékok között egyedi, de persze a karakterekek nyújtotta bizonytalanság, blöffölés, partijelleg nyomokban sincs meg. Az árát simán megéri, de sajnos a szabályfordításban több hiba és hiányosság is található. :(

Rating based on solo play only. There aren't many decisions to be made in the solo game. You're generally at the mercy of the cards in your hand and often only have one playable card. Your hand quickly get whittled down to fewer cards due to obstacles, which gives you even fewer options. I think this game will be more fun with two players, but solo play is lacking.

Some weird and unnecessary mechanics in comparison to the original game. For example, you could your way all up to a treasure to find nothing but dust, and then there are simple road cards that grant you gold immediately. A decently fun game on it's own but a bit disappointing if you really enjoyed the original game.

RATING: 6
Not as good as previous entries in the Saboteur series, but enjoyable enough for what feels like a 2p take-that game. The problem with a game structured this way is that it feels like you can't ever get anything done. Either you're too busy trying to slow your opponent down, or you get hamstrung from a card your opponent played until you draw a card to overwrite it or by effectively shrinking your hand down a card. I've seen some decisive victories, but for the most part, it seems like no one gets much of anything, or one person runs away with it. This is a fine game if you want something that feels like a much more in-your-face version of something like Carcassonne, but without the hidden roles, it isn't nearly as interesting.

I haven't played the solitaire version, though it sounds like it would be pretty frustrating since you have to play all bad cards that you draw on yourself.

3 plays - I'm not a huge fan of Saboteur, so was not expecting to enjoy this tremendously. It was better than I had expected though, creating interesting new ways to block/ interact with pathways that make it work for 2p. Still not a huge fan of Saboteur, but I would happily play this from time to time.

I bought it, because I mostly play with my mom. Yes, game works good and it is still same - rush for gold theme.
I scored it so low because I think that this game 'tried' to be same original for 2 players, but it loses it's beauty here - hidden role/deduction, which is what I like about original.

I was hoping this game was going to convince me to buy the original game for parties. I don't think it succeeded :( It has some clever variations but I think the setup is a drag and the gameplay can take a negative turn with a single card. Something my wife does not enjoy in games where she's been planning for 20 minutes lol...

Played after watching the rather brutal Dice Tower review and, sad to say, we agreed it wasn't very good, but for different reasons: my husband found it overly long for the weight of the game while I found it oddly unpolished. Shame because I really like mining themes and the concept of this as well, but the execution fell short.

„Sabotażysta – Pojedynek”, czyli kilof w kilof albo kilof w plecy. 

Plusy: 
1. Kompaktowy rozmiar 
2. Wariant solo 
3. Proste zasady 
4. Mechanika 

Minusy: 
1. Grafiki 

„Sabotażysta – Pojedynek” to szybka gra która pozwala wbić komuś kilof w plecy albo iść ręka w rękę. Gra jest ciekawym przerywnikiem lub rozgrzewką. Zaskoczyło mnie w niej to, że zajmuje sporo miejsca na stole. Polecam 6/10

2017-09-16 - Bought as super-light filler (starlitcitadel); Too simplistic; DON'T play with the "tools"; it's boring if you can't draw the right card; you can either discard 1-2 cards and draw ONE (1) SINGLE card; or you can PASS, discard 1-2 cards and draw AS MANY as you DISCARDed; lame.

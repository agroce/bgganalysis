Next War: India-
Pakistan. What a long name
For a one-map game.

Honestly, this is my favourite series of wargames. I'm just on a kick of writing comments in haiku at the moment!

Next War is an excellent series, and really shines with the advanced rules. This installment is more manageable than Korea and primarily land-based (though some American naval air might show up).

1 basic scenario and half a turn of an advanced scenario. I love the rules and components. It's big con Is time consumption. Will play more.

Theoretically I was more interested in Next War Taiwan and even in Next War Korea, but really I like NK:IP even more. There aren't naval rules and hence the game is somewhat simpler. However there are plenty of possibilities both as far as the scenarios are concerned and as far as the possible interventions are concerned (China, US, Russia, CW, France!). Also the war theater is really interesting with three different zones with their peculiarities and difficulties that however are somewhat linked.
Really a great game!

Interesting system and well-written rules. Great components and player aids as well. Only minor complaint is that I found the TEC pictures a little too small. Pleased I took the punt and bought the whole series so far.

India-Pakistan offers some of the toughest terrain in the series with serious mountains and major rivers in abundance.  Other than that, India-Pakistan is the usual Next War situation with the aggressor running wild for about 6 turns and then getting flattened (potentially) as the other side  reinforces and perhaps gains air supremacy.  As the aggressor you must go for the sudden death victory conditions as you probably won't be around if the game goes to the end if you don't win by mid-game.  Looked at from the the other side of the hill, the sudden death rule effectively mandates a firm (and bloody) defense in those first critical turns.  You've got nukes on both sides, but using them can lead to a premature ceasefire.  Decisions, decisions.

The rules are long and complex, but clear and well indexed and cross referenced.  The advanced air game can double the playing time (and complexity), but adds tremendous depth to the game.

The materials are the usual robust GMT pieces, player aid cards on solid stock, and glossy rules booklet and map.

Overall, a real challenge for both sides and a great chance to brush up on your Russian and Chinese export aircraft.

If you're looking to get into this series I would suggest starting with this game.  There are no naval units, so that definitely takes the complexity down a notch or two.  The series rules by this time are pretty tight and there are a wide range of basic and advanced scenarios with very good replay value.  The basic game can be set up and played by most gamers with few problems, but the advanced game is going to take an investment in time with the first turn or two going by very slowly.  The good news is that the investment is definitely worth it.

Standard rules - Very good 'normal' wargame. Meaty enough to be interesting. Slightly limited situation so I wouldn't reccommend it for the standard game only.

Advanced rules - What is happening on the ground is somewhat drowned out by the air power systems. Lots to think about but a bit of a disjointed 'narrative' as the advanced rules take so much effort and time to get through the turn. Still, the erosion of enemy air power and focus on striking HQs, supply dumps, airfields etc, make the slow grind interesting.

I don't think the rules minutia is worth the effort. And I don't imagine that I would _ever_ have used the advanced air power system.

Micro-managing of each attack procedure is a lot of effort for little positive effect. (Makes PBEM more cumbersome.)

For example, the air/helo support. If each side commits some air points and a couple of helicopters, that means there are multiple ADF die rolls to generate what will end up being just ONE modifier to the battle die roll.

And it is almost a given (sort of a running joke during the game) that the side with a DRM in its favor will end up with a worse result than without the favorable DRM. You get to the point where air points and helos are just not worth the hassle of commitment and ADF rolls, since even if they get through they often don't help you get a better outcome.

True, columns shifts to the right, and negative DRM's almost always increase the chance of generating an "R" result - but that is often irrelevant if the defender is allowed to ignore the result by passing a ER check.

I would be curious to know if ANY player of the game ever uses air points to escort airmobile and paradrop moves. (Or maybe that is their proper use, since escort points are not subject to ADF?)

The ZOC rules are quite complex and easy to forget in practice (especially the 2 stacking points rule). And there are some anomalies - for example, ZOC does not extend into a mountain hex, but It does OUT of a mountain hex (into flat ground, for instance).

Also, armor and mech are not allowed to attack into a mountain hex except via a road hexside, but they can attack OUT of a mountain hex (to flat or rough for example), even if a road hexside is not present.

City and Urban hex confusion: unlike most other wargames, a city is just a terrain feature of the hex it occupies. Urban is a separate type of hex.

You can bypass an enemy city only if the hex is vacant, but not if it is being cleared by one of your own units.

Border forts: if occupied, they provide a 2-column shift for the defender, so even a lowly outpost can create a significant delay. If unoccupied a fort only negates road movement through the hex. So a vacant fort in a non-road hex has no effect at all.

Just some of my thoughts after several scenarios with the standard rules.

Next War series has an impressive density of warfare mechanics in a relatively small box! India Pakistan is a great example (although no navy to deal with here) I should say that some may be put out some by the amount of things you need to manage in the Advanced Rules of this game but I feel those details greatly enhance the experience. Managing everything from missile strikes, to special forces missions to air to air engagemen's, air strikes and of course the tactics of brigade and division level ground combat. Supply and isolation are dynamics needing to be tamed along with finding the right combination of attack units, combat air supports, artillery and logistics to form good offensive posture. I highly recommend this game system to those who love to dive into the details and aren't afraid of a few casualties on the way.

This is the most accessible game of the [b]Next War[/b] series, by virtue of there being only one map, no strategic map, and no naval units. The basic rules represent a generic mid–complexity hex–and–counter wargame, but the advanced rules represent a high–complexity but also incredibly interesting take on modern warfare. Although the multitude of tables looks daunting at first, the rules are inherently logical and like the [b]Operational Combat Series[/b] you'll quickly get used to them.

The CRT is very bloody and unpredictable, both for the attacker and defender. The trace supply rules in the advanced rules is highly restrictive, so you'll often find yourself fighting over a crucial stretch of road instead of outflanking it. The advanced rules for air power are incredibly interesting, factoring in detection, stealth, range, all–weather capabilities, stand–off capabilities, and different types of anti-aircraft defences (e.g. interception, AAA, SAM)—it's almost a game unto itself.

Pakistan has a small but capable air force, whilst India seems to have quantity over quality. Above all, Pakistan has a tonne of missile points and some scenarios allow them to fire several missile points before the game even starts. Most of the high VP locations are in the Kashmir and Jammu provinces, but the terrain is very rough on the attacker. The international posture matrix creates the opportunity for a Sino-Pakistani alliance that could bring in some desperately needed airborne infantry for attacking Kashmir. On the other hand, a Russo–Indian or US-Indian alliance would be devastating for Pakistan with their vast quantity of high quality air units. For both India and Pakistan's forces to get across the river to take Lahore and Amritsar respectively is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Infantry holding an urban hex is almost impossible to defeat without suffering very heavy attrition. Both sides have precious few attack aviation, but enough to provide a small edge to one or two combats per turn.

Interestingly, if there's nuclear release for Pakistan there's no incentive for them not to attack India's nuclear facilities with nuclear weapons, as there is a net VP gain for Pakistan. Similarly, when reinforcements enter the map they are stacked into a single hex. If a player can get detection on this stack (e.g. via SOF reconnaissance or air supremacy) they can attack the stack with two nuclear weapons, which will cause 2 step losses to all units in the stack, wiping it outright.

Playing/teaching the basic game first scenario to a guy whose only wargaming was Axis & Allies and Twilight Struggle.  He's catching on well which shows how well this game scales from the easy-to-learn basic game (standard rules, no optional add-on rules for now) to the advanced game with its detail and those cool little aircraft.

This is a great series that adapts to your gaming experience level and your desired level of realism.  For now I'll rate it an eight and revisit the rating after I gain experience with the game.

IMHO the more accesible next war series game, not naval movement, just one map, a lot of different terrains, with nuclear bombs options (advanced rules), a lot of fun in each scenario, I'm really enjoying testing the game, the two sides are very similar but the terrain of the two countries are very different, Khasmir zone near all the terrain is mountain and the Pakistan terrain is clear or marsh (except the Islamabad hexs that are mountain), and in that game appear a new terrain "big river" only you can cross the river if the hex have a bridge, but the other side can destroy the bridge

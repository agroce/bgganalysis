Still quite admire the game but it just doesn't get pulled out much.

130929 Still one of my favorite light games.  I play with the newest carrot cards, but using a die to randomize the events instead of drawing them out of the deck.  Great game from 2P to 6P.

120102 Great game.  Still holds up over the years.  Works well 2P -- well enough I wrote a review about it here on the geek.  I've also played it 5P and quite good also.

Finally got a play of this at GEN CON 2017. I enjoyed it and can see it as a smart racing game. However! It isn't for children - the math is too much. I have a thing against games that present themselves as charming, but are decidedly not. That is the case here. So an ok game, but not one I will ever own now.

A simple family race game with a decent amount of strategy involved and just a sprinkle of luck. I think it will probably pay to get the most functional board and the best ‘jugging the hare’ rules.

Häufiger in CLZ gespielt.Das Spiel spricht schon wegem dem schönen Spielmaterial an. Das Spielprinzip ist relativ einfach aber es kann doch zu Überraschungen kommen wenn dann jemand von ganz hinten auf einmal an allen anderen nach vorne zum Ziel vor sprintet. Dann kann man nur noch hoffen, dass er sich verrechnet hat mit zuviel Karottenpower über das Ziel hinausschießt. Dann hilft ihm nur noch Salatfuttern und das Tempo rausnehmen. Man braucht zwar keinen Computer zum Berechnen der optimalen Karrottenanzahl aber ein bisschen Kopfrechnen ist schon gefragt.

Fairly revolutionary non-die rolling (at least for movement) race game.  The squares with rewards for being in a particular position in the race lent the game to screw the other player tactics and ensured that no two games were ever the same.

[b]Spiel des Jahres 1979[/b] (inaugural award)

[i]Posted: 5/14/06, Rated: 7[/i]

Triangular numbers have never been so much fun!

If you're a math geek on top of being a boardgame one, then you know that triangular numbers are the sequence that is created when you add the counting numbers together for a running total: 1, 3 (which is 1 + 2), 6 (which is 1 + 2 + 3), 10, 15, 21, and so on.  A true geek knows why the Greeks called them "triangular," but my point has been made already: this game requires a good deal of math.

Looking at the childish track, and noticing the inclusion of a die might lead you to suspect that this is a roll-and-move game.  It is not.  Each turn, a player decides how many spaces she will move.  Moving is paid for in "carrots," which are the equivalent of currency.  The amount paid is -- you guessed it -- the triangular number with the same number of terms.  Don't worry, tables are provided.  Eight spaces in one turn will cost you 36 carrots.  Two turns of four will only cost you 20 carrots.  This kind of calculation is the crux of the game.  

There is a lack of confrontation with less than five players.  With five or six, enough people are vying for the same spaces that it's hard to break away from the pack.  Once someone starts to pull away, it is almost impossible to catch them.  There are spaces that impart a random effect, hence the inclusion of the die.  These effects vary depending upon your position in the game: those that are further behind are more likely to roll something positive.  None of the effects can slow down the leader, although someone in fourth place or lower can jump one position ahead with a lucky roll -- assuming there are that many players.

As the inaugural winner of the [i][geekurl=/wiki/page/Spiel_des_Jahres]Spiel des Jahres[/geekurl], Hare and Tortoise[/i] will always be a classic.  It is definitely a vast improvement over genuine roll-and-move games.  What seems to be a kids' game is too demanding for young children, yet the theme is a bit too childish at first glance for adults.  I do enjoy playing it, and it gives me an excuse to talk about triangular numbers.

Excellent game. Very enjoyable for many age levels, accessible for non gamers.

Race games are typically given some type of luck factor to make them more tense. Hare & Tortoise has a small dose of luck (the Hare spaces), but it is much less than other race games (die-based or card-based games where every move is almost random, or your opponents options are unknown) and it offers each player precise information at all times, again very rare, especially in race games. Still comes out as a great game, and one in which every race is different.

A fascinating, and classic race game where the balance between luck and planning has landed almost completely on the skilful scale, as movement is completely diceless, and only some event spaces use a dice to generate results (that are favouring trailing players). Instead, ongoing race order positioning generates the carrots that are needed to move forwards, with players in total control of where they want to move to. However, to reach a square, you need to pay as many carrots as the sum of jumping to all squares you pass over as well (its triangular - so moving 3 squares would cost 1+2+3=6 carrots. moving 20 spaces 210!).

Carrot management is key, and the race between the hares amongst us (those who always rush forwards in small steps), or the tortoises (those of us who hang back and accumulate far larger amounts of carrots for big leaps at the end) are equally viable, and complicated by the restriction that only a small amount of carrots can be taken over the finish line, and that each player needs to lose 3 lettuces during the race as well. There are only a few placed where you can do that, and only the trailing 5th and 6th player can gamble on a lucky roll to lose that way too. You will have to figure out what other players are likely to so, as the bulk of you carrot generation happens as a result of predicting you race position at the start of your turn accurately. And people will mess with that.

I do love this game, but tend to get it out when there are exactly 5 to play. Any less and the positioning is a bit too predictable, any more and the queues for the lettuce spaces bog it down a bit too much for my liking.

The mechanism is wonderful, I have nothing but admiration for it. It is maybe a bit number-crunching heavy for those who really plan, and thus will feel a bit dry to some. But that doesn't really bother me, as I like the puzzle of it all. Sure, there are some very obvious move sequences in certain positions, but given that people can more or less pick their own moves, if this game was programmable, races should start to resolve themselves in similar ways, as people are getting more familiar with their better options in their position. Yet, it seems players are unpredictable enough, as all the races I have been involved in, have played out very differently.

The only thing I dislike is the mechanical "hanging around" order in which players target the initial lettuce spaces, waiting for it to be cleared by the player(s) ahead of them. People deciding that their best option is to jump ahead is what actually brings life and intrigue to the game, but if you aren't ahead of the bunch, you're gonna have to make those extra carrots work for you if you want to regain the waisted time.

It is one of those games in which, I feel, a player who started later will have played better if they cross the finish line first. Even if the game has loads of elements that aid them more than the players at the front end of things.

The first player to lose all 3 lettuces will be hard to beat, the clock certainly starts ticking rapidly when that happens. And since player #1 can land on the first one right from the start, and will hog that space for 2 turns, it does set that player up for a bit more control over the rest of the game, than those who still need to scramble for those key squares on 3 occasions. With only 4 of those spaces in play, that counts.

There are very few games this old that have held up so well, and over time I am simply growing fonder of it. I am not sure if I would take to it quite the same way if it was a recent release, given that there are now so many good games to chose from. But it does have that little something that begs for it to be noticed, and I won't say no to it for years to come.

Rating after initial play: a solid '7'.  A simple racing game with enough nastiness and strategy to keep me entertained.  Still, I'm not quite satisfied by the ending.  *slight downward correction (to 6.5)* The starkness of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. just doesn't sit right with me.  Have only played two and three player though, so rating should most probably increase with more players.... or maybe not...
*Then again as a light game it doesn't seem to appeal to newbies because of its dry calculating (Final = 6.0)

Strangely enough when my brother and I started our challenge to play every Spiel des Jahres winner, this game from the very first year of the award was one of the ones I was most excited to try. People told me it was a race game with very basic rules which actually contained a good amount of strategy. Yikes! Talk about crash and burn! This math-fest was far from a fun quick race. Instead it was a thinker that forced players to sit and calculate out the best method to cross the finish line. When someone finally does cross the finish line it seemed so anticlimactic that we didn't even know whether we were supposed to just stop or keep playing for places. It also feels odd that the only random element (aside from the hare spaces) is the actions of your opponents. It appears this game might start to feel repetitive as players just fight to get to the same spaces again and again, and strategies don't vary much at all. The requirements for finishing also seem too limiting. Forcing players to make certain stops along the way is just silly and drags the game out even longer. I didn't despise the game and could probably be talked into trying again, but I'll never suggest it and might try to weasel my way out if asked. With all the great games that have won the SdJ, I'm kind of sad that this is the first on the list.

One play with 4 players and I liked it.  This isn't an amazing game, but it's fun and captures the racing theme really well.  It has catch up mechanics for the players who are behind and rules for winning the race that force you to balance what you're doing and even a nice little dose of luck that should be there.

After a second play with 5 players, I think 5 is the better number but I've lost interest in this game.  Maybe if the players moved really fast it would be okay.  The dose of luck mentioned above is more than just a dose and I just felt blah during this game.  I actually won this round and played with a fun group... IMO, the game was the problem.

Tentative 6 rating but I would like to play with experienced players to get a feel for real strategies. I was initially shocked that a player had to discard 10 carrots every turn, until I realized there is a certain sweet spot of moving back that will actually get you closer to the finish line. Must play more.

UPDATE: Once I understood what each space did, I think this game is very strategic.  I can see this game going up farther than a 7.  I really like the two player version of this game - I give it an 8.

Why do I detest this game so much?  The rules just make no sense in the context of the game!  I could maybe deal with having to eat the stupid lettuce, but why do you have to be on specified spots to do so?  And why do you have to finish the game with fewer than 10 carrots?  I don't know why this gets under my skin, but I truly hate this game with a fiery passion.  If this is the only game my group is playing, I will take a nap instead.

2-6 | (4-5) | 45 min | 8+ | David Parlett
A unique racing game where timing is key (i.e. being in first position is not always the best option). Players advance by consuming carrots in a triangular progression (1 square = 1 carrot, 2 squares = 3 carrots, etc.), but they must also get rid of three lettuce cards and cross the line with 10 or fewer carrots left. For such an old game, it feels quite unique, and a worthy SdJ winner.

A good game that can be played by kids and adults alike (although younger children may need a little help.)  The theme fits perfectly because "slow and steady" really does win the race.

Admittedly I'm no great fan of race games.  Hase und Igel however does strike me as one of the better ones. Partly because I'm  fond of the fact that being behind may actually work to your advantage. 

I recall playing this once when 8 or 9 but have no recollection of my feelings about the game back then. So my rating is that of an adult. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the game would have appealed to me a good deal more back then. Some kids will however be put off by the calculational side of things. 

For the 1970s this is a remarkable design and hasn't aged too badly. Save for the chance deck which does seem rather lame by today's standards.

My rating reflects me being in no particular rush to play H&I again. However, if factoring out that personal preference, I'd give it a 7.5. But that's not how BGG defines the ratings...

Not at all the kid's game that it appears to be. In actuality Hare is a very mathy, number crunching game that is all about opportunism and screw jobs with a dash of luck via the hare spaces. The game makes moving quickly just expensive enough to make one think twice, and staying back in the pack just lucrative enough to keep players reasonably clustered together, and in that pack there are a lot of chances to make clever plays to net oneself money, or to hurt the opposition.

I do enjoy the game mildly, but when I think about playing it, nothing really stands out as especially compelling, so I have to give it a 5. This is a really, really good game given its age but too dry and unremarkable for me to really love.

This title stirred childhood memories. I got this game as a little Maarten because my parents thought all that electronic stuff that was so fashionable and desirable at the end of the 70's/beginning of the 80's bad for my general development. So the got me this game which had some arithmetic in it, quietly forgetting you need someone to play against, i.e., them. Unfortunately they thought the game rather annoying, so their own (supposed) cleverness backfired considerably. If they had wasted the money on some electronic gizmo, at least I would have been a [i]happy[/i] little Maarten, and one who didn't pester them constantly to play this game.

Now, nearly 25 years later (!), I played my first game of Hare and Tortoise with the full knowledge that yes, it is a boardgame, and against equally shrewd adults! Such an experience is rare, and despite the fact that I suspected that I wouldn't really like the game, I was still eager to give it a go. My suspicions were right: I didn't really like the game although it has a few clever mechanisms in place which allow you to obtain 'money' (carrots) you need to get along. The game is (of course) a big race to see who can most economically jump through all the hoops and over the hurdles. It is a fairly dry game too&mdash;there isn't that much variation in it as you cannot actively hinder other players. Not a game I would like to own, but I will savour the memory in the years to come.

Not every SdJ winner will still feel like one today, and that certainly was the case with this one, at least for me.  The basic idea is interesting and appropriately thematic - you need to win the race, but occasionally need to slow down (i.e. move backwards) to gain some steam.  Going with the tortoise is a guaranteed payoff, while going with the hare is a risk.

Generally this just felt too mathy - particularly at the end when you're trying to see how many carrots you need to finish but making sure you don't have too much.  The blocking of the lettuce spaces also got tedious.  Not my cup of tea.

Sam's - from me Spiel des Jahres
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
A classic, this was the first "Spiel des Jahres" in 1979.
I remember liking it in my childhood/youth, but found playing it again now really disappointing. I am very glad that gaming has evolved considerably since then and that there are so many games out there which I like so much better.
Particularly, I don't at all like the mechanism that you mustn't have more than finishing position times 10 carrots left in the end. This requires you do plan extremely carefully towards the end of the game and you get punished big time for any small mistake in calculation a few turns earlier. This is true for games I love as well, for instance Chess, Terra Mystica and Antike Duellum from my top 10, but I think it doesn't fit the supposedly quick family game Hare & Tortoise at all.
Moreover, the hidden trackable information (HTI) sucks (concerning number of carrots of each players and hare cards already drawn) - as usual for HTI, see general preference #6 in my profile. (I deducted 0.5 rating points for the HTI rules.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A board game which carries the appearance (and, thus, some of the nostalgia) of mass-market roll-and-move games, but has a much more interesting movement mechanic. Plays reasonably quickly, and takes 5 or 6 well (although there can be frustrating waits for lettuce spaces with that many). There's some pretty swingy randomness (the Hare spaces), but it's all voluntary - players who hate the dice can avoid those spaces, while players who love it can jump on them every chance they get.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
Picked up for $1 at a local auction, and it is my prize pick! This game looks simple, but there is A LOT of depth to it. Another brain burner.

Components: Colorful, soft graphics. The carrot cards are a bother; I would have preferred more standard denominations. The different action squares are distinguishable, and fairly easy to remember after a few turns.

The game that opened my eyes to the REAL boardgame world. Goodbye dice, finally a clever, no a shrewd game with fantastic mechanism.

And also because it opened my eyes for creating boardgames myself.

Stuart hated the mathy aspect. A large part of the game is definitely about arithmetic - working out how many carrots you'll need to get to the goal given your likely path.

Requiring everyone to eat their cabbages gives the game some focus, whilst the board and rules seem well designed to provide multiple viable strategies.

I'd really love to play this again and experiment with strategies. 

I'm excited by the potential depth despite the similarity, but it is definitely 'math-y' for such a 'light' game.

What a good game. Fun for children (8+) and adults alike. Absolutely great with 5 or 6. The 2-player rules allow for some extra tactics in manipulating your two playing pieces.
(Will need to try 3 pieces during the next 2-player game.)

But that Jugging of the Hare! My current take on it...

David Parlett has new thoughts on jugging the hare. Of the rules discussed I like the following thematic solution...
"When you land on a hare square, you "turn over and go to sleep". That is, you turn your token upside down, on your next go turn it face up but don't move, and only on the turn after that can you move away. This neatly reproduces the Aesopian feature of the hare's taking a nap. However, if while you are napping another player overtakes you, in either direction (including backwards to a tortoise square) this immediately wakes you up. As soon as you are overtaken, you can turn your token right way up (out of turn) and then move away again on your next turn as if nothing had happened."

I very much like the above for the leading hare. For the other hares/tortoises, in 2nd-6th place, I prefer the D6+position table (*), but in my own modified form:
(2 is obsolete, 3 & 7 are changed)

 3  	Take a nap. (As outlined above.)
 4  	Move back to the last vacant carrot square (if any).
 5  	Chew a carrot. (Draw 10 out or pay 10 in).
 6  	Restore your carrot holding to exactly 65. (If you have more, pay in; otherwise draw out.)
 7  	Free turn. (Reclaim carrots paid to reach this Hare square. The 2nd & 3rd only half.)
 8  	Lose exactly half your carrots. (If there's an odd one, keep it.)
 9  	Have another turn.
10  	Move forward (free) to the next vacant carrot square (if any).
11  	Chew a lettuce. (If you have any lettuces, treat this hare square exactly as if it were a lettuce square.)
12  	Restore your carrot holding to exactly 65.

Alternative: In a 6-player game, perhaps the 2nd hare should also take a nap.

RATING: 7.5
Like it. Surprising amount of contention for the lettuce squares in a 4-player game. (Even better with 5 or 6.) Winning strategy does seem to be to hang back accumulating carrots, then make a mad dash for the end. But do need to be quite careful with counting - when making moves of the order of 25 places, a miscalculation means you can have dozens of carrots too many to finish.

This game is pretty interesting but there is too much math in it for me.  I prefer the simplier and more elegant version of the mechanics with Cartegena.  I rated it a 4 because I doubt anyone would get me to play it again.  Even so, I should say that I don't think it is a poorly designed game.

Interesting freebie for my kids from a friend. I think he just wanted to get rid of it. The card/ movement mechanic requires more thinking than most little kids can handle. They get impatient.

Very clever game - needing to decide when to hang back and when to leap forward makes the game title particularly apt.  As only one player can occupy each square and the effect of many squares depend on a player's position in the race, there's a lot of scope player interaction.

I have the 1987 Gibson Games edition, which as well as a bigger jump to the first lettuce, has satisfying wooden pieces and a board comprising 4 pieces that fit together, along with the late-Victorian style artwork.

On Bruno Faidutti's Best Games List.

This game has been on my shelf for years.  I never noticed the box said 12+ years, so had assumed it was a little kid's game.

It's a math game and even though a chart is included, some players just brain burn.  It is not hard but the board positions change with every turn which changes your plans.

I thought it too repetitive.

Players are trying to get rid of lettuce and arrive at the finish line with the correct amount of carrots--a balancing act.  The first game I had way too many carrots and lettuce, and the second game I did it just right.  

I would play again with older children, but hope they out grow it quickly.

The game that introduced me to the world of board games. 

So very unique, cute and fun! I enjoyed my 2 plays very much. The decisions you have to make are not too complicated, but playing well requires doing a bit of math in your head (and I LOVE math). You can go the whole game without ever using any luck - but you can if you want. The most appealing thing to me is how the fuel is a tool and too much of it hurts you at the end. And well, the analogy this game draws is classic: Slow and steady wins the race. 

I can see how this would be a great one to teach children.

I've only played the 4-player version of this. Truly original mechanics.  If I've a criticism, it's that the end-game is far too asceptic and calculating - once you've ditched that last lettuce, the game comes down to working out how to blow your remaining carrots on a long-distance sprint to the finish in as few turns as possible.  Whether the extra players make that harder to plan and achieve, I don't know - it seems plausible.

Would stand up to repeated plays. Probably what I like most are the position balancing mechanics that were I feel quite unseen in games at this time until Euros became popular more than two decades later. Quite impressive!

I thought this might have been a kids' game, but it can be challenging even for a 10 year old. I quite liked it, but the theme doesn't really match the dryness of the game. Often people who've played it know that it's too mathematical and don't want to play again. However that's what excites me about it. I also like trying to guess what people will do next so that I can get free carrots on the 1/5/6 spaces, or else interfering with their plans when they try to prevent me from claiming those carrots. I find the maths trivial and it doesn't deter me from the game at all. I find this game frustrating with 6 players, so have demoted it from a 10 to a 9. I've also found the game frustrating with 5 players, so I'm dropping it to a 7. I love being able to make good moves, but too often I find myself having to make a move which can only be described as "not particularly useless", and that bores me.

I'm on a roll. My streak of finishing last in every game I play is intact after being introduced to Hare & Tortoise, a race game that pits rabbits against one another. Carrot management is the key component to this game, and I miscalculated at the end, so I ended up with a handful of veggies to eat instead of being able to cross the finish line. The only tortoises I saw in this game were the spaces on the board that allow you to collect carrots instead of expending them for movement points, so I think they ought to change the name to Hare vs. Hare. I enjoyed it, and I think it makes for a great family game. I just don't think I'll be hopping out to buy it anytime soon.

Extremely nice design for a race game, with heavy resource management and a very slight amount of luck.

RATING: 7
Hare & Tortoise is only any good with 4 or 5 players in my experience - 6 is too many and 3 is too few.  There have been a lot of different versions of this game over the years, but most of them are unbalanced.  You want to look for two things.  The first lettuce should be on the 10th space, not the 7th.  The method of "jugging the hare" should be rolling a die and then adding your position in the race, then consulting a chart numbered from 2 to 12.  The only edition I know of that gets it right on both counts is the Gibsons edition.  The Rio Grande/Abacus edition can be fixed by using the hare chart found at http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/172873

It’s ok- the theme lifts the gameplay slightly - until you run out of carrot inspired puns.  And what’s with ‘jugging the hare’?  Why add a randomiser into what is a competent abstract strategy game?  I can only assume that in the 70’s, without a ridiculous dice rolling mechanic you’d be booted straight out the publisher’s tiny, dank, office.

Nice mathy race game. Although you don't have to do to much math, everything is provided for you, so you don't overheat your brain and still have fun.

Ok, so race to the finish line. You'll need your carrots, but not too many. And don't forget the lettuce. Can't move forward? Use the turtle, or stay put and hope others won't change your ranking to get what you want in carrots. 

For a race game, this has more strategy than expected, but in a good way. Plus it plays six so it's nice for bigger groups especially for fun gaming evenings.

I saw this about 20 years ago, but didn't have the resources to purchase it at the time, and have regretted it ever since. Now I've just acquired a copy (the Waddingtons print) off ebay. 

I recently took it to a family meet up where I played it with my Sister (44) my Niece (16) and my Nephew (13). From a cold start we got about half a game played in 1 hr. I suspect experienced players could have finished it in that time.

The game mechanics are beautifully designed with lots of choice of action and control (with an element of chance for those that like that sort of thing). There is good variety in the strategies available and scope for tactical play too.

We abandoned the game due to circumstances beyond our control, but all the players were eager to play again next time.

First impressions after one play are that this is well worthy of the first SDJ award. Simple enough for a family to play, and competitive enough for anyone. The randomness is very minimal, yet it is easy to play lightheartedly or with lots of thinking. It seemed to go on a little too long, though this may simply be because it was the first time for many of us. I really like how cleverly you are rewarded for being in last place and then can jet ahead at the last minute. Yet if everyone hangs back, the player in the front will have the advantage. It is very difficult to reward someone for doing the opposite of the goal and this game accomplishes that perfectly.

This is a cute little family game, where the player in last place gets the most movement (but has limits on where they can move).  It has a jeaopardy element with the "salad eating" requirement that can really mess up your plans.  

That being said, the game is a "one trick pony" in that each game is much like the others.  It is also a bit of an arithmetic lesson, which is usually not appreciated by my game group.  I think this is a beginner Euro game, but not much more.

Like Adel Verpflichtet, this landmark game will always be regarded as one of the classics. It's supposedly a diceless race, but it clearly includes a die for the 'jugging the hare' catchup mechanism. For the most part you play opportunistically, taking carrots and discarding lettuces as you can, before calculation takes over in the endgame. Fun for the mathematically inclined, but overall it  works better with 4 than 6.

It's a type of game you can sit back a bit and enjoy playing it and laugh and joke a bit while playing.

Interesting take on racing, not much luck, would be nice if it worked well for 6 players (hopefully) and different than most of the race games I have played to date. 

It is a little mathy as you try to optimize your positions and manage your hand. I have a feeling it will run too long with higher player numbers for what it is (and be too chaotic sadly) which means tweaking might be in order...

Good to know there is a lower luck strategy race game around, not sure if I will keep it yet, most likely best with 3 or 4 but I will try all numbers and update.

Hare & Tortoise is a uniquely original race game in that movement is governed by skill rather than chance. Instead of rolling dice to find out how far to move, you can always move forwards as far as you like - but only if you can afford to pay for it. This you do by consuming units of energy called carrots. The 65 carrots you start with are just enough to get you home one square at a time by spending one carrot per move. Alternatively, they are enough to get you up to ten squares forward in a single leap, and you can earn more by carefully choosing which square to land on.

Clever system. First past the post wins, and at first glance it looks to be a simple race, but the tactics are  subtle. You need carrots to move, and the farther you move, the more carrots you burn. You need to move backwards to replenish your carrot stock. The trick is to know when to dash ahead and when to pull back to gain carrots - get the latter right to win.

Don't let the theme deceive you--this is a tense, cutthroat, race game. Players control their fate by deciding how much to move, whether to play it safe or take a chance, when to drop back to gain carrots, and when to make a big jump ahead. Players will be jockeying for position and blocking each other using an array of viable strategies. The game has aged well, giving it a certain charm and nostalgic value. As the first SdJ winner, it also engenders an appreciation for the history of the hobby. A fun, innovative game that appeals to a wide audience.

Pretty much comes down to a luck, despite the mostly deterministic shell.

It's pretty obvious from the start how access to the salad squares is going to work out, so the disadvantaged players have to take stupid chances with the die. If they succeed, somebody else will then be in a hopeless position, and have to press their luck.

Played this a fair amount, and it does pass the time well enough. Just don't expect too much from this due to it being a "classic".

I wouldn't want to play this all the time, but with serious players, I see how this could be   a very complex game.  You have to appreciate the design.  While it appears to be a children's roll-and-move game, the calculation can be as intense as you wish.  I would never play this with an A/P-prone player, but played tactically it is quite fun and still unique.

I think this may be a game you have to play once just to get what it's really about. Efficiency gains are part of it, but just collecting astounding amounts of carrots is not; ultimately you have to spend about as much as you earn. Things didn't end well for one of us who spent about 300 carrots to move to a rabbit space near the end and drew a "last move was free" card! Incidentally I'm not a huge fan of the rabbit cards and would like to try without them.

Actually much more of a role-selection game than a race game; because you're choosing squares rather than rolling to move (and because each square can only take one player), it's all about second-guessing your opponents' choices. Somewhat let down by fiddly calculations and random-effect squares, sadly.

Cuando me tocó en el Jesta 2014 y vi la caja, me dije, vaya mierda, ya me ha tocado otro juego de niños... Sin embargo, una vez lo juegas, te das cuenta de que lo único que tiene de niños son las ilustraciones y temática.

El objetivo es simple, debes ser la primera liebre en llegar a la meta. A partir de ahí el juego se convierte en pura estrategia y cálculo, porque tú eliges libremente cuántas casillas avanzas o cuántas retrocedes; teniendo en cuenta lo que te cuesta cada movimiento. Por lo tanto el azar se reduce a la mínima expresión.

Ganador del premio Spiel des Jahres en 1979!
Fue el ganador de la primera edición de tan prestigioso premio.

[b]Players considerations[/b]: 
Going first is a huge advantage since you can get one cabbage eaten right away. Start is slow and congested with more than 4 players, but it is also more fun with more players. Probably 5 is sweet spot.

[b]My thoughts[/b]: 
A little slow first time playing, until you realize how much risk/reward comes into play and you try going for longer moves. I like storing up for a huge move. My first game came down to one move and I was going to get 55 carrots perfectly to move far enough straight to the finish and end with 0 carrots too!
Part of this game is luck, where you can't really judge your carrot total at the end, and you don't really per say make up for past mistakes in this game, rather you should just aim for not too little carrots or not too many.

By all accounts, this game should not be as great as it is. The theme is geared towards a younger audience. But at the same time, it's really the kind of theme that could be considered timeless and one that can easily span across several generations, bringing gamers of varying age groups to the same table. Reading the rulebook, this race could not sound more dry or less entertaining. More than anything, it sounds like a really boring math problem, like dividing 82912856839182365094 by 2; You know it's going to be easy, it's just going to take way to freaking long.

And yet, Hase und Igel/Hare and Tortoise defeats the odds and proves to be a fantastically engaging and fun game. The player interaction is reasonably high and keeps everyone on their toes. Players will more often than not be cursing their neighbours for taking/keeping them out of their desired position, robbing them of bonus carrots. It also gets extra marks for being a game with several strategies, while having a painfully simple rule set, appealing equally to the most casual gamers as to the more avid ones. I really can't recommend it enough. [b]9[/b]

MY FIRST BOARD GAME: well my first REAL board game. I got this at about 10 years old from a local game shop. i picked it out myself and I was hooked on board gaming from then on. Nostaligia will bring this of the shelf for me. but I am surprised how many people are just drawn into it. i get requests all the time, yes, from my adult friends. 

This game has a FANTASTIC MECHANIC it's fun to work out for yourself an feels a little diferent every time.seriously RECOMMENDED FOR KIDS LEARNING TO COUNT AND BUDGET as this game is educational without feeling like it. My mom just bough one for an infant so that the second she is old enough, Hare and tortoise will be waiting. 

Stop wasting time and get your carrots on the table!

I don't like the fact that you care constantly moving back and forth on the racing track. The fact that you must use a chart to know how much carrots you must pay is also annoying. A broken element of the game is the fact that you can eat cabage if you are lucky enough in your die roll which prevent you from losing 2 turns. It's just too much powerfull. Also when you ran out of carrots, it's really hard to get carrots back. So in overall, I don't like it

RATING: 5
I really like the mechanics of this one but it actually doesn't seem all that fun or enjoyable to me.  It's not bad since it's kinda short but the thorn in the game for me are the "hare spaces".  The main randomness lies within the hare charts and that can either:  give you a crucial advantage (eat lettuce or gain another turn immediately), or leave you devastated via lost of turn(s), carrots, spaces, etc. or combo of any of these.  This type of randomness isn't fairly balanced with the rest of the game, in my opinion.  Otherwise, I do like the rest of the game.

RATING: 5
One can only move as far as one has carrots to take them...and cannot cross the finish line to win unless you've eaten all but 10 carrots or less of your stockpile.  Seems like making a beeline for the lettuce is the key to the game unless one can roll a "5" on the hare spots.  Oh yeah, don't play this game at 10:30 PM on the second day of a junior high youth retreat after only getting 4 hours of sleep the night before...:-)

I expected a bit more from a Spiel des Jahres and mathematician David Parlett. Granted, the game has little luck, but almost no strategy as the other players will always screw with your plans. For me, the game doesn't do anything that Cartagena doesn't do better and the skipping of turns gets a bit old.

That said, the movement mechanic is inspired and I wish other games would use it somehow.

What a strange game, but not in a good way. The basic concept of jockeying your position to want to be just behind your opponents so you can leech off your opponents but not so far behind that they can make a mad dash for the finish and leave you in the dust is sound, but the implementation method is really weird. Everything just seems there for the sake of mechanisms, but make little sense thematically, and the game seems to intntionally give you awkward numbers to work with, which increases tactics but makes things even more jarring for me. There's the triangularly ascending movement costs, the wide swings in the rabbit catchup mechanism, the unexplained reason you get carrots for being in a certain position at the start of your turn, and my leadt favorite, that you actually want to move backwards sometimes.

The artwork is also a clashing set of realistic looking art cartooniness.

Pretty cool. Now, I'm familiar with the triangular numbers, so I don't really need to look at the chart, but I don't see what the fuss is about: travelling in larger steps is less efficient, which is bad, unless you're trying to get rid of carrots, in which case it's good. Smaller steps, lower cost per move. So why ouch? Enjoyable, lots of room for tactical play on top of the global strategy, which would make it good for families, and reasonably enjoyable even when you lose.

The only pure racing boardgame (not including PitchCar) I own and a fantastic one at that.  Plenty of strategical thinking to be done here (more than you would assume at first glance).  Plays quick so doesn't outstay its welcome.  However, it often feels  the player that goes first has a slight advantage.

Must have been great in its time, but now it pales before any game since 2000.  Very innovative method of gaining ground on the board leads to increased frustration as nobody can get to the winning spot without a lot of back and forth.  You are pleading for the game to end--by flood or by fire--in the endgame.

Although a well thought out and very interesting game I really have to be in the right mood to play it-but when I am I enjoy.  The tactics you need to employ to further your position while hindering your opponents builds the right amount of tension-but play with the wrong people and there can be a bit of downtime.  In this instance however it gives you an opportunity to think about your moves.

Racing game where you expend carrots and lettuce or rest to gain carrots. The more you move, the more carrots you expend and you need to finish the race with no carrots. I know this was the German game of the year in 1978. Unfortunately, it didn't do much for me. Sometimes luck played a part if you placed in a certain position to get the bonus. Like other racing games, if someone else occupies a key spot (a cabbage spot before the end), you could be in big trouble.

PROs: This is an amazingly solid game for how old it is. I would call it timeless. The strategy is tricky where you have to build up your supply if carrots but you have to make sure you scale your supply back down before you're allowed to cross the finish line. Very interesting.

CONs: The original rules for the hare space are based too much on chance. However, the game designer has an online blog and we found an excellent new way to play the hare spaces.

After all these years, still a unique racing game. Not as mathy as some people pretend it to be, unless I'm simply playing terribly, because the shifting nature of your position relative to other players keeps calculations in flux. The game lacks the outright excitement of some other race games, making it very different in feel from most. It plays better with more players; with  4-5 being ideal.

A racing game where dice (should) play only a minor role. Basic movement is using carrot cards. It takes only a few to move a few steps but amount increases very fast and makes big leaps very expensive. This is very nice mechanic. As a added bonus you can't have more than 10 carrots in the end to win the game.

Hare & Tortoise is a fun racing game. Works well with 4-6 players.

Update (14.7.2009): I liked playing Hare squares as "designer intended" as explained here on geek : http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/265377

Note (15.7.2009) : Actually the latest word from the designer (according 'geek, again) is :
"The designer changed [his] preferred method for the Hare square :
from: * cannot not land on Hare square
to: * landing on Hare square--take nap and lose 1 turn"

Perhaps I should try that one too when playing with HC-gamers.

RATING: 10
Not all too complex, but extremely clever family game where players have to reach the finish line by eating carrots they need to collect on their way, either by going backwards or by landing on the right spots. Nevertheless, they can only win with less than 20 carrots in the reserve, and having stopped three times to eat a lettuce. Throughout the game the positions of the players on the track will exert influence on their movement and their carrot income.

It's difficult to imagine a race game as unique as this one - the extra conditions to win deepen the tactics; levelling the income of cards so that the players behind get more than the ones on the front gives the game a surprising balance, and having players trying their luck if they want or playing entirely on their own strength is a feature I haven't seen in any previous game (afterwards only Torres comes to mind).

While not every round is going to bring the same fun (it's a bit weaker for three players), this masterpiece easily deserves the highest mark for being accessible to players of all ages and for being built on mechanisms both simple and original.

Rightfully a classic and well-known for being much more devious than the innocent art would have you believe. We much prefer playing with David Parlett's original rules for the hare (to whit: miss a turn for landing on a hare space). Great for teaching anyone the multifarious ways you can be really evil in a board game!

An interesting racing game that although at first glance looks like a children's game, definitely is not.  One must carefully manage your carrot cards (used to move forward) to cross the finishing line first while ensuring you have no more than 20 of them when you do.  Oh yes, make sure you eat your 3 lettuces before you finish!  There appear to be several strategies one can employ to try to win.  Only one play so far but I'm keen for more.  I have the lovely 1973 Intellect square box version that I bought for AUD$1.00 at a school fete.  I also have the 1981 Waddingtons version that was an AUD$3.00 garage sale find.

A very unique way of moving along a linear game path. I have tried this game with more than 3 and I did not care for how the game played. I prefer to play with three players. In my opinion, this is the best. The requirement to eat all three of the lettuce and to finish the game with a specified number of carrots adds a nice level of complexity that seems subtle at first, but try to finish the game when four players are crowded around the last turn! That situation will change your mind. Childish name: complex strategy! A lot of fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A simple racing game which to it's credit is mostly deterministic. There can be some AP in the last 10 mins of the game as people figure out how to ditch excess carrots, but apart from that it is light hearted fun, but still with meaningful decisions every turn.

Someone said a computer would be very good at playing this, and that's a valid observation. You have to plan your jumps so you use carrots at the optimal rate - there's a narrow band of acceptable carrot levels to cross the finish line with, which will require good mental arithmetic.

A laborious exercise in going back and forth using the medium of carrot economics. On my last game I got sent back to the start because I didn't have any legal moves, then landed on a hare, rolled a one and missed a turn, then again landed on a hare, rolled a one and missed a turn. Go back to start? Miss a turn? At that point I felt like I was playing a particularly sadistic roll-and-move children's game so quit. Can't imagine bothering to play this dated game again.

RATING: 7
It doesn't come out as often as it should because of its mathy nature, and because I tent to expect the game to go longer than it does. And then I remember how much I enjoy the positional jockeying (the crux of the game) and the fact it's all over in 30 minutes, almost filler territory. In essence, it's a game of continual guessing on whether the other players will allow you to gain advantage. Will they collectively move so that you'll be in third when it comes back around to your turn while you're on a 3 spot (because it's to their personal advantage to do so), or will they make potentially lesser moves to deny you taking advantage? Self-interest vs collective good - it makes for interesting decisions in a game of this weight and length.

I have the original of this somewhere, but bought the re-release out of nostalgia. I used to know the designer, David Parlett, because he was one of the regular play-testers at Games & Puzzles magazine. He is better known for his books on card games, but this was his great success in board game design. It is a race game with no dice and no luck. To win, you simply need to optimise a modified Fibonacci sequence of movement v food collection.  :-)

RATING: 7
There aren't many modern games where the goal is to get from start to finish first (and where the space you land on matters). This is not because these are inherently bad games, as Hare & Tortoise proves. There simply isn't much design space left. Hare & Tortoise has taken a big chunk out of that design space, as is takes a somewhat brain-burning, mathematical approach to the race game genre. There's randomness and luck in the 'hare' squares, which might be considered a flaw, but certainly increases the replayability. As a race game, it's too lineair for my tastes; too much like puzzle solving. Still, Hare & Tortoise is a really good game.

After more plays, I can see its rating go up. I thought it might be too difficult for nongamers and too easy for gamers, but it might be exactly at the right spot: one of those rare games that you can play with your family and that's still interesting enough to play with your game group. I would change the hare chart if playing with more serious gamers, though. It's too good and too random. My non-gamer family loves to hit the hare spots; in the early game to get rid of lettuces, and later with big moves to get the free move or extra move. Sure, one of them will be unlucky and skip many turns, but there's always one lucky person who gets it just right and wins. With that much luck you might as well play snakes & ladders.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Once you get to grips with what space does what, provides interesting problems as what move will benefit you yet provides less carrots for your opponents. Nice balancing mechanic for those left behind, but I find the number crunching too much for a game that needs at least 4 players to provide interesting competition; any more and downtime is an issue.

Well, it definetly wasn't a luck filled dice fest that it looked like when seeing the board, but something completely different. Our game started nicely, but soon after the finish line had already been crossed, some of the players coming behind quickly grew bored. Especially when having gazillion carrots left next to the finish line and doing the gruesome task of trying to get rid of them. Not enough player interaction and the whole calculating aspect of the game didn't encourage many :-)

This is a cunningly designed race to the finish in which your fuel (carrots) must practically run out (all but 10 carrots or fewer) at the moment you hit the finish line. You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race. The farther you move, the more carrots you spend, and there are a variety of ways to gain or lose carrots as you go around the track. It's a very clever exercise in arithmetic which has been fashioned into an entertaining and unique perennial favorite.  Kids & Adults will love playing this together!  Recommended!

Interesting mechanics in the use of currency (carrots) in the game - you're always trying to get more, then suddenly you are trying to shed them at the end.  I enjoy this game when I play it, but don't often request it when the option is there.  I might try playing it more to see if my opinion changes.

unbelievable this came out in the 70's.  way ahead of its time and still holding as a very good game. has a fell of euros today.  However, can be plague with down time with a lot of people.  no depth of strategy as wait and gather carrots and then strike with a serious of large moves is the best.

Own both Hase und Igel (1978) and Hare und Igel (2000) to get the primary differences of available variations (see  Greg Aleknevicus' comparison of versions in the links).  Main differences -- jugging the hare:  cards vs. die  (and) first lettuce space (7th or 10th from start).

Nice puzzle trying to work around other players and get to the spaces you need by figuring out the right number of carrots you need to get and spend and getting the timing down right. Going forward as far and as fast as you can is not always the best move here (or even possible). A racing game where you decide (and pay for) where you want to go. Not too many games like that out there.

This is only the second of all the Spiel des Jahres games I would actively avoid playing again (besides Sagaland). While Sagaland (Enchanted Forest) is just a terrible luckfest if played with people that have at least average memory (aka every single adult alive), this is an exercise for accountants playing a tug of war using math problems as their weapons. (Did I mention I hate tug-of-war games? All the back and forth again and again, so repetitive - ugh.) Who's best at doing arithmetics several steps in advance? Very anticlimactic ending, too - after so many back and forths, someone finally has it right, but it took soo damn long that nobody feels like going on, trying to make second place.

Hare & Tortoise is a clever series of maximin problems with some luck thrown in weighted to help losing players. It's certainly interactive, and I like how deceptively it camouflages its viciousness with a childish theme, but I think the endgame will be close regardless of what players do, which exacerbates the luck. Be aware that it's very mathy. Mathiness aside, as a lighter game for larger groups, it's pretty good. For its age, it's impressive. Compared to Cartagena...

Hated my first play, many years ago. Finally played it again Jan 08: not so bad! Rating 4-->6. A race/math game of optimizing your leaps forward and your drops backwards, to try to get your bunnies to the finish line. A little randomness (yours only if you choose, by landing on a hare space) is nice, too.

Each player gets 65 carrots and n lettuce (# varies with player number). Move forward as many spaces as you want (1 hare/space max), paying according to #spaces (triangle progression: 1, 3, 6, 10, etc.). Alternatively, move backwards to first unoccupied tortoise space. Spaces have different features:
- numbered (1/5/6, 2, 3, 4): if that is your place in the race, get 10x carrots; then move on.
- hare: roll d6, look at chart for effects
- carrot: if starting here, either take or lost 10 carrots as your move.
- lettuce: flip token over. Next turn, flip back face up, discard 1 lettuce, earn carrots = 10 x position in race.
- tortoise: get 10 carrots/space you moved backwards to get here.
To cross the finish line, you must have 0 lettuce left, and may have only 10 x (position in race) carrots in hand.

This is one of those games that just seem to work perfectly. It's simple, but extraordinary at the same time. It's beautifully balanced, and allows for multiple strategies. I love that you can even choose how much luck you want to inject into your game.

Hare and Tortoise works well for both adults and kids. Not only do I love playing it, but my 6yo does, too. It's helped her with resource management, planning ahead, and evaluating different strategies, and she gets a little math practice in on every turn.

My comments apply to a 2-player game, as that is the only way I've played so far. I like being able to choose between two pawns each turn, so I don't know if giving up that choice and the resulting control would affect my enjoyment of the game.

The new edition where all you have to do to chew a lettuce is land on a rabbit square and roll a 5 constitutes a *severe* deviation from the spirit of this game, which pivots on the competition for the lettuce squares.  The old "jugging the hare" rules only award a lettuce if you're fifth or sixth from the finish line *and* can roll a 6 or a 5 (i.e., your total has to be 11).

[RGG 'Hare and Tortoise' 2000 edition] {Animal racing; mathematics, dice-rolling, variable-player-order; optimal 4-6p} H&T is an interesting racing game with moderate depth. The theme fits well to the original story. Easy to teach and learn. Good for all kinds of players. It deserves its game awards. It's a very good family game and is worth the prizes.

Mathematic calculation is the core of H&T. People who dislike mathematics may not like this game.  H&T is quite balanced - lagging players can turn over and the leading player have to strive to keep on but there is no bashing the leader problem. The "rabbit" dice-rolling effects are very important in H&T. Without these random effects, the game will just fall flat and become very dry.

H&T is funnier and exciting with more players where players have to strive to eat the "lettuce" and have to find "carrots" to eat. 

The quality of the game components is good. However, the graphics of the hare is quite disappointing. It would be wonderful if rabbit miniatures are provided :laugh:

I think it's extremely clever.  This is just a classic mechanism with so much odd math in it.  You can literally win by going the slowest.  Very cool and perfect matching theme.  Great graphics and, just such a cool mechanism.  Sorry to say, the complexity doesn't match the childish art (which I love).  I'm just saying they've confused their market.

Slightly more complex than I thought it would be. This is a family-fare tactical racing game with a bit of math (not a ton, but its there). Sounds like its best with 5-6 players.

Very mathy game that supports up to 6 players. If people play quickly, it probably supports the maximum, but more likely accommodates 3-4 players fine without overstaying its welcome. Probably a very good game to play with children in their late elementary years to help them with math.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It's fun to plot out different strategies, to plan your big jump, and to angle for position bonuses. But the game play is just a tad too dry for such a whimsical theme. A game that from appearances seems like it should be a lot of laughs is really a gamer's game at heart.

RATING: 7
Woah!  This is unexpectedly math-heavy, particularly the end-phase.  The number crunching was too tricky for Miss 7, however Miss 9 seemed to be coping okay.  Might let this sit on the shelf for another few months before attempting a replay.

Beautiful board art and typically high quality wooden components (Ravenburger, 1985 edn).

RATING: 6.5
Low ranking due to being quite math-heavy, which reduces appeal. With a group that is okay with a math-heavy game, this game is easily an eight. On its surface, this game is a simple roll-and-move game. Once you replace the die with a complex math problem, things get interesting.

[thing=361][/thing] is a racing game, from 1973, and it could have been first released last week, as it is still fresh, a true modern board game. The rules are simple: players pay to move, and each house on the track has an effect: usually give more carrots (the currency in the game), some depending on certain circunstances, some including the risk of losing carrots instead of gaining them.

The speed of the advancement is determined by the player, inside the possibilities of how much she can pay - going from big and costly runs to a careful, slow going and cheap pace, likely using the back of the pack to gain more carrots. Therefore, in [thing=361][/thing], unlike many other racing games in which going at the maximum speed possible is usually the best way to go, allows for different approaches to the race towards the finish line.

Even with it being the first Spiel winner, [thing=361][/thing] wasn't a game on my radar, and it caught us by surprise: we didn't know it in detail, and its excellent gameplay, ideal duration and high level of interactivity and possibilities, left us agape by the overall quality.

[thing=361][/thing] is an easy going game, easy to teach and play, with straightforward rules, and it delivers a nice and constantly changing experience, since the race momentum is defined by the players, what worked in one play might not do so well in other, providing a good level of replay value.

Highly approved.

A clever idea that almost works, but ends up being just a bit too "mathy", tedious, and random during actual play.

I recently played this again with a mixture of teenagers (who all play various Euros) and adults.  It didn't work for the teenagers either.  Ok, but not something they particularly wanted to play again.

Everything about this game feels solid. A bit outdated perhaps, but solid. Unfortunately, however, it also feels a bit dry and mathy. It is like you are numbercrunching every single turn. That makes it a good excercise for 7 or 8 year olds, but a bit too analytical for adults. And the problem for 7 to 8 year olds, is that there are quite some rules to explain.
Still, it has some clever ideas, and it does not take too long to play. So I would probably play again if I was not too tired and someone else suggested it :-).

This came from an era of "linear track, first to finish wins" games.  All such games deserve a 2 at best, with this one exception.

One five-player game so far. In general the game is ok, even good when compared to the age of it.

But there are some issues, that don't feel good. Yes, you have a theme, but many actions just contradict with the theme. Why you can't finish with lot of carrots? Why you need to eat the salad? Why you can dump carrots only on some squares? Why would anyone want to reverse to an hedgehog?

It looks like a kids game, but it has more depth than they usually have. The end game can be very frustrating if your plans go wrong or you don't have a plan. The rabbit squares are quite random and some of them are also very cruel.

It's always refreshing to find a racing game that does not conform to the old roll and move style of play.  Don't be fooled by the colorful and cute presentation at first glance.  Hare and Tortoise, while touted as a family-oriented title, is actually deceptively strategic if you put your mind to the math.  Positioning is the key to everything, as most of the special effect attributed to each spot is largely determined by where you are in the competition.  Although there are a couple of interesting ideas, alas the game felt like more work than fun to go through.

Doesn't look like much but it's actually a bit more gamey than you might think. You pay carrots to move, and gain carrots basically by moving backwards. You have to move to certain spaces to get rid of salad cards, else you can't go to the goal. First player to the goal wins, but you can't have more than 20 carrots when you finish. Very nice.

the game clearly has its weaknesses
it can be frustrating due to the dice and sometimes it takes very long
a few rules and scenarios also seem simply out of place
but if you like coop games and the zombies are at least ok for you, then you can definitely have a lot of fun here
especially if you have no problem to make your house rules, nothing really speaks against the purchase

Slightly better than Season 2 due to the Missions

Nothing beats Zombicide.  It is the end all of all Zombie games.  Hands down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
FAVOURITE GAME - it's a quite good dungeon crawlish game, where essentially you have to get all your survivors out of an infested town. The rules are easy to grasp, the hard part of the game is figureing out the tactics taking account that zombies can spawn virtually everywhere and can wreck havoc in a jiffy. The game is scenario based, but it has quite a big replayability thanks to the randomness of the zombies that appear. One neat thing in this season is the helicopter, which you are able to pilot and get through the map without having to battle the zombie hordes.

A lot of new things in this expansion/basebox. 
More varied than S1, less circonvoluted than S2, the tiles and maps are really nice. The equipment deck is a lot stronger than previous seasons, and less equilibrated, but there's less possibilities to search during the game than during previous seasons. 

The new zombie type (a new standard) is not that great: a bit too complicated and unintresting. The scultps are also less attractive than previous seasons, in my opinion. 

Season 1 has excellent tiles and the most charismatic characters. Equipment is not that intresting/varied. The tiles are really good, even if a bit samey. Standard zombies do the job really well. Simplest mechanics, and a lot of fun.

Season 2 has the best zombie types. Berserk zombies, in addition to normal zombies, do add a lot of tactical choices. The equipment deck is really well rounded, especially with toxic city mall added. The tiles were not that good, and missions a bit too directive with some flaws and overcomplicated rules.
 
Season 3 is the best for the tiles and missions, in my opinion. The equipment deck is a lot less equilibrated (a lot stronger) than S2 but better than S1, and the zombie type is a bit too complex and unintresting.

Average.

You just have to treat it for what it is - a beer and pretzels game - where you just want to kill lots of zombies.

Benefits from some house rules:

Ranged Weapons - only hit survivors in the space you are shooting into if you roll a 1.

Zombie Split - if split is uneven, then just let it be uneven (don't spawn another Zombie).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Favorite of the main box sets so far:
1) Love the team actions which work great co-op and can't wait to customize into many of my future Zombicide games. 
2) Find the crawler zombies work well with the extra team actions option
3) Love the fact that the deck has such a high abundance of great weapons.
4) The new spawn option I like because zombies will spawn often unevenly which I find fun and plan to work them into the other boxes since that will really help add variety. Also now have a great way to make scenarios scale well for 4 heroes which I prefer when playing solo.
5) I actually like the event triggers adding suspense and spawn variety. Also can be easily incorporated into any game.
6) Like that the intro scenarios can be played in less then 2 hours.

Only thing I don't like is the competitive mode but there are only 2 scenarios in the book that can't be played co-op. 

The only reason I like Prison and Toxic Mall a bit less is game length. Found every scenario extremely long. While Prison feels like a real prison to me(not that I have any first hand experience lol!) I still have not played a Toxic Mall scenario where I get that special I'm in a mall Dawn of the Dead feeling. My goal is to one day design a classic George Romero Dawn of the Dead scenario if I can figure out a good one. 

Can't wait to incorporate many of these great new mechanisms into all my zombie games. Also excited about Angry Neighbors. Was reading the rules and wow 15 new scenarios 5 for each base set!!!!!

The third stand alone game in the Zombicide series that is set in a hospital.  This game comes with 12 new survivors, 9 double sided tiles, a helicopter, and equipment/wound cards.  This 3rd season introduces the Skinner Zombie type that comes in walker, runner, fatty, and abomination.  If you ever roll a 1 while killing a Skinner (walker, runner, fatty) Zombie, you create a zombie crawler.  While slow moving and seemingly unthreatening, these crawlers are last in the targeting priority and can sneak up on unsuspecting survivors.  Similarly, you need to plan accordingly when attacking Skinners in melee/point blank range.  The Skinner abomination can only be killed by a Molotov or flame thrower type weapon.  In addition, this abomination grabs all survivors in adjacent zones and pulls them into its space.  Same rating as the base game.

We are not a big fan of zombie game and horror theme but just want to try something new. Gameplay is fun though we feel the game rule has too many condition that tends to be forgotten during gameplay.

This is the game that ultimately got me into modern boardgames. Growing up I gradually switched from boardgames to videogames and Zombicide has a very videogamey feel!

Inevitably S3 with AN has to be compared with S2 and TCM.
I rate S2 higher. S2 is kind of more tactical due to the nature of different Zombie types. Berserker you need to kill melee and Toxic you prefer kill ranged. In S3 it is not important with what weapon you are equipped. You can kill Skinners, VIPs and Seekers and even Crowz any way. This leaves out the pressure to have the right weapon at hand.  So yes, I will integrate older Zombie types in S3 and wished it was just an expansion. 
 There are too few seeker spawn cards when you throw in all Spawn cards there are in S3 that Seekers would get an extra activation.

Have pretty much all of the Kickstarter material.  I thought Season 2 (Prison Break/Toxic City Mall) was the perfect balance of new zombie types and mechanics.  Season 3 had a bit more experimentation as Guillotine Games/CMON tried to evolve the experience.  Wasn't a fan of a lot of the changes and just want to stick with the Season 2 rules and systems.

A pretty ordinary Zombie game. Like all others, you simply move, search or attack. I was hoping that there was something new or clever about this one, but it played pretty same-y as every other one I've played.

One really horrible design decision was needing a minimum of 6 characters per mission. That means the players are juggling between multiple characters. That leads to a pretty severe downtime. Also, backing the KS, the game came with so many boxes and different ways to play that it was quite overwhelming.

A nice game which includes a lot of minis. While I can't be bothered to paint the sheer mass of those miniatures, it's still very enjoyable with unpainted minis. While the gameplay is really simple and there are hardly any tactics involved, we're still enjoying this game quite a bit. The fast paced gameplay lets us actually finish a game session in a reasonable amount of time, so this can actually hit the table from time to time (unlike games like Descent or Arkham Horror, which usually take too long). After having played through quite a few of the missions by now, I wish there was a little more variety though.

Guillotine really put it all together with this last season making the best version of the spawn system for the modern version of the game. The scaling is baked in. Skinners are a wonderful new addition to the mix, and having beds to spawn extra surprise NPCs in the interior of spaces makes those areas terrifying.  This was our entry point to modern and really opened our eyes to the possibilities.

Skinner zombies are very good addition / expansion to the regular zombies
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
Zombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue arrived, along with a slew of other Zombicide stuff, in a tea chest sized container a little while ago. This month I broke it open and got in a few pretty good games with Mrs Fish. To get a both of an idea how good the new expansion is we played with Zombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue as a stand-alone game one – no other bit and bobs were added to the mix. After all, it’s supposed to be a complete gaming experience so it should stand on its own merits.

Well, Guillotine Games have done a pretty good job with this one as Zombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue is indeed a fine stand-alone game. More pleasing is that Zombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue introduces a number of new elements to Zombicide that keep the game fresh and introduce new challenges. Zombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue is set a few months into the breakdown of society and the rise of the undead. All the easy pickings have been taken and survivor groups need to take greater risks to get what they need. Zombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue introduces hospitals - a potential source of supply but, given the nature of the zombie plague teeming with undead.

The new skinner zombies are quite challenging in that when killed they can turn into crawlers. Crawlers act as walkers but are the hardest to hit on the target priority chart. the A-Bomb abomination is pretty bad news as it officially takes 'a lot' to kill (not like the three hit creampuffs in earlier editions) and can grab survivors from a zone away and drag them into their zone. There is also a spawn card which has the A-bombs show up while the team is still on blue which really makes like difficult (and short).

Also new is the variable spawn points as pretty basic idea but one that adds a bit more uncertainty to the game. Same with the event triggers which also work well for hospital tiles. Sadly, neither tokens were included in the Kickstarter-exclusive plastic token set; guess I’ll just have to keep on using the cardboard stuff for these tokens. As well as hospitals the game includes markers for the now-abandoned tents in fallen evacuation. This is another good little addition that pieces up the game and keeps the players on their toes.

The rules for the helicopters (also new this edition) are, at least initially, a bit fiddly but don’t seem to work too badly once you get the hang of them. 

Other new-to-this-season features include team actions which are pretty useful when used well and the adversarial/competitive mode rules which can pit players against both each other and the undead menace. As Mrs Fish likes the co-aspect of Zombicide. Nice to have though for the more cut-throat amongst us.

As ever, the production values are tip-top and the twelve new survivors have a fair bit going for them. Overall, Zombicide Season 3: Rue Morgue is another excellent package from Guillotine Games and one that every Zombicide fan should seriously consider acquiring – I’m sure I’ll get plenty of use out of it in the years to come.

I loved Black Plague, so I picked this up along with the other seasons. Despite the decisions made for the targeting rules, I found this game to be just as good as Black Plague. Now, I did play this with the first three seasons mixed in, so this is more of a rating for the modern-day Zombicide experience as a whole. Some of the items are a little under-powered, and the rules for cars are a little odd, but otherwise I had a lot of fun with this. Berserker Zombies and the ones that turn into crawlers make things interesting, too. I think the one area where these older Zombicide seasons struggle more with is the tension. Black Plague does a good job of making things tense throughout, while the older Zombicides are pretty tame until people start getting more XP. Not that there's anything wrong with these decisions, but I do think Black Plague, as a whole, works better, mechanically, than the other seasons.

Another wonderful expansion to Zombicide! This set is a good set for beginners. As an experienced Zombicide player, I find the scenarios a little tame so far. But am looking forward to some of the hard cases in the back of the rules book. Hands down...this is the best rule book yet. Very concise and it clears up several minor questions we have had with game play. We are not fond of the new rule however that says that doors are automatically opened with a proper tool but without rolling. There sure is a lot of humor lost in making several rolls against a tough door and failing every one of them. Stuck in the street beating on a door while the zombies are coming at you early in a game when all you have is a pan is classic zombie movie stuff. Anyway...we play the old way; actually we ask the players if they want to play the old way or the new way...and you know what they always pick the old way!

The addition of the skinner and crawler zombies are just...to sweet for words! We played several scenarios with just the skinners and crawlers to really get the rules down pat, but we prefer mixing the decks with all the zombie types for more intense game play. If you play on just the hospital boards the crawlers are very deadly. But on the opposite boards, unless you are using the tents, the crawler cards don't trigger anything. That's just too easy! So we play where a crawler card triggers at least one crawler on a spawn zone, but we are thinking of ramping the difficulty up on that by making blue level one crawler, yellow - 2, orange - 3 etc.

The new weapons are as usual...awesome!
The new characters are sooooo good.
The skinners splitting on rolls of one is hilarious and I laugh every time...it's a shaky kind of laugh riddled with fear...but it is funny!
The crawlers creeping out of those blue and green beds...love it!

I am so far disappointed in the helicopter and pilot abilities. So far, the helicopter is nothing but a visual feature on the board. The scenarios barely see any flight with it, making the pilot skill useless for your character. I suspect this will change with further fan made scenarios and combining maps from different sets to create some wonderful opportunities for tactical helicopter flight. I hope so! 

One other concern, is the lack of cars that work in this sets scenarios. The cars are such unique opportunities...they tease you with their possibilities of mowing down multiple zombies as you roll through spaces. Sometimes you know you shouldn't go for the car...but you just can't resist that temptation. In many a game with new players, I have seen people seperate from a group in a fool attempt to become all powerful in a car...only to die in a couple of rounds. I have to say, it really is fun to see new players react when you tell them that the cars can be driven. Their eyes light up and all of a sudden the game ramps up in it's level of awesomeness in their eyes. Some people have complained about the cars being over powered. I have to say those cars were well play tested and depending on the scenario you play, the cars have differing effects. So anyway...please incorporate a working car once in awhile...hint hint!

I played this game blind, knowing nothing about it. I've now played five games of varying difficulty with two to five players and won four times.
I find this game annoying to play for several reasons. There is one obvious choice each turn about what the survivors should do, you then search and get some random item that increases the amount of dice you can toss around and hope you don't get unlucky when it comes time for combat. You don't actually need to be at the table to play this game as it basically plays itself. Each turn is a group decision so individually there isn't anything to really do. If this game finished after 20-30 minutes I wouldn't have any great problem with this fact. The problem is this game can go on for 3+ hours on the larger missions and it gets so bloody tedious, especially the missions where you randomly flip over objectives and either find it straight away and win or are forced to move all over the map doing the exact same thing every turn.
I can't stand this game. The models are cool and I suggest using them in the far more involving Dead of Winter.

Plays are recorded in the base game entry.

I'm not going to say this is the Zombicide that Zombicide always wanted to be (I'm waiting for Black Plague for that!), but this IS a very nice fine tuning of the system. The weapons feel less overpowered and the new dice-based spawn points offer a fantastic way to scale difficulty. The event tokens make large indoor areas much easier to create and the skinner zombie rule (turns into a crawler if you rolled 1s) makes the normally overpowered duel-wield-5-dice-each attacks more of a risk to use. I really like it.

The helicopter enables some interesting level designs and also provides a more thematic way to create an exit in the middle of the map (even when the heli itself can't be flown).

I got a copy of the retail version in a math trade.  I rate it highly for solitaire play.  Some of the more unusual rules (zombie splitting, unable to target ranged weapons) make it more puzzly than immersive, but that's okay for solitaire.  It is immersive enough, though.  Had a fun experience trying to dodge the big bad zombie boss by making enough noise to lure it away from my fleeing characters.

I've only played the first game a couple of times so it was daunting to see the new rulebook. Now it looks more like a rule novel.

Now Rue Morgue went and upped the ante. This is without a doubt the new starting point if you want to dip your toes into Zombicide.

The Skinner zombies are more fun than the original batch, and not difficult to use, so this really is where you ought to start. The new Zombie Spawn Cards for hospital beds are great! The Tent Cards are also cool.

The star of the show are the new Event Tiles though. They are bloody fantastic! Now you don't spawn an entire house by just opening one door to it, instead you spawn each tile the moment you step on an Event Tile. Beautiful! I will modify any old mission to use them from now. A few more of them would be appreciated though, so we at least have nine (currently only six).

The Spawn Locator Tokens are also terrific. Now you put these numbered tokens on each Spawn Point, and then roll dice based on the number of Survivors in order to spawn zombies. Wow! So much better, more balanced, and especially more thrilling.

I simply don't like the whole Zombicide Franchise. I've played several sessions and it kind of started to numb me down after two or three plays. The minis are nice, yes that is a given, but I'd rather skip when offered to play it again.

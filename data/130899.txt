A challenging game for such a simple concept. I really like this one. My only complaint is that the art is a little too busy and makes it hard to instantly see who one. In know way a deal breaker, just an observation.

This is one of my favorite card games, don't know why it's not rated higher.  I like the balance of trying to run 2 different strategies in your hand at one time.  Take the trick?  Or go for the points at the end.  I really need to get the retail version.  Also, great family game at Christmas time - easy to play, easy to teach, easy to learn.

A very simple card game in which you're playing to score the various days of Christmas from the song, but there is a pretty sweet 'generosity' mechanism using Santa Claus and Mrs. Santa which gives it a little bit more strategy. Good family fun, I like it but wouldn't have minded if there were a little more to it.

Simple bidding game where cards in hand at the end of the game gets you points as well as the items you bid on score. The start the round you had a card to the player to the left making you somewhat control what they have in the end game. Nothing stands out except the Christmas theme, something you don't see a lot in gaming but only an average game.

I don't play a lot of trick-taking games; usually not my style. But I think the decisions in this game are interesting. I doubt I'd turn down a game of this, but even though the "12 Days of Christmas" theme is loose, I doubt I'd think of suggesting this game outside of Christmas.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I expected a little bit more from this charming Christmas game. With multiple scoring methods, the disqualification of tied cards, and the null value Santa cards, I expected this to be more fun and provide more outburst moments than it did. With any more than 3 players, the deck must be reshuffled which removes an otherwise interesting card counting aspect from the game. The passing of cards to other players is the most interesting aspect, as it helps balance the luck of the draw, but more importantly gives players a way to tailor their hand. When competing for tricks, ties happen much less often than one would think, even with five players, thus the lowest card played wins almost every trick, which makes the trick taking predictable rather than tense. I'll likely still play once a year, but it will never garner the enthusiasm I had originally hoped.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice little holiday card game, with great art. The card stock seems a little thin, and we may need to sleeve this game. It's not really trick taking, as you select cards simultaneously, but it's an interesting game that'll have you considering which cards to pass, which cards to keep in your hand for endgame scoring, and which cards to play.

Got this as a gift and am very pleased. I'm not usually into card games let alone a trick taking one, but this was so simple and quick to play and a lot of fun also.

The theme is great for a Christmas time filler, as this would be a great game to introduce to the family and friends during the holiday.

The cards are very thick, but a bit difficult to shuffle and the artwork is really well done and colorful.

Overall. A great little game for the price and time it takes to play.

Many thanks to my good friend Candy, who sent me this game for Christams. I love it.

Another implementation of the "pyramidal deck" by James Ernest. Surprisingly solid bidding card game with some really good hand management. 

Each turn you pass a card and then bid for a scoring card. You need to play the lowest card to take a scoring card over the twelve rounds, but at the end of the game the person with the most of a group of cards will get points equal to the card value. So early on you want to get rid of your high value cards, but later on you want majorities in higher value cards.

A very enjoyable trick-taking game that does enough different to allow it to stand out.  Not only does it work well for the Christmas theme, it's a great one to play any time.  I really enjoy the "gifting" element of passing cards each round which actually changes strategy quite a bit.  Awesome Christmas (or any time) game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Everything happens in twelves. You have a hand of 12 cards. You play 12 rounds. Cards are worth from 1-12 points. Every round you "gift" a card to the player on your left. You then bid for a point card (worth 1-12, depending on round), with the lowest card winning. Then you draw. Repeat 12 times. At the end of the game players with a majority in their hand for each number scores that number, so if you have the most 10s, you add one of your 10 cards to your score pile. The number of cards of each type equals its value, so there is 1 one, 2 twos, 3 threes and so on. There are also two zero value cards that can be used to win bids for point cards, but if you win with them, you have to gift the card you win to someone else.

This is essentially a set-building auction game. The twist is that the sets you are building are in your hand and are not revealed until the end of the game. Since you are forced to give up two cards each round, it can be hard to maintain your sets and to know how many of a number you need to save to get your majority. Careful observation of the cards folks bid with can tell you what people are not likely to be collecting. We found that early in the game you sort of commit to certain numbers and then only a small portion of your hand cycles and it is usually dictated by what you draw. Since you have limited visibility to what others are collecting, your hard decisions start to feel a bit like guess work. It's a strange game that I didn't dislike, but still found it a bit unsatisfying. This is a borderline low 6 / high 5 game for me. The artwork is garish and hard to read and bland at the same time. I don't know how they did it.

Fun Christmas filler card game for all types of gamers. Not to be confused with Dr. Gordon Hamilton's "12 Days of Christmas" which is also a fun game but has more simple, traditional trick-taking rules. I like them both but prefer "12 Days" over the other. Both have a place in my collection, though. "12 Days" has a little more depth for gamers and "12 Days of Christmas" is more for non-gamers that enjoy traditional card games.

Another post-Tabletop acquisition, this is a solid thematic trick taking game. I love the theme/art, and it’s a great lunchtime filler game.

There is a deck with 12 12s, 11 11s… down to 1 1. You play them to take tricks with the lowest card winning the trick. Any ties are removed from consideration. The tricks are worth increasing numbers of points, starting at 1 and going to 12. At the the end of the game, you then compare hands. Whoever has the most cards of each number gets that many points (ie most 7s gets 7 points). You add the points from the tricks to the points from your hand composition to get your final score!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Super fun, super quick card game. Each round, you "gift" a card to the player on your left, then bid one card. The highest unique card wins the prize, which go up in value each round. At the end of the game players score points if they hold the most of a particular number in their hand.

Fairly quick and light card game. Each round you pass a card to another player, play a card to the table and draw a card from the deck, trying to balance between holding onto lower cards to win tricks and higher cards to get majorities. It's very straight forward, and looks gorgeous, and good for the odd play. I will say the Christmas theme does make it unlikely to hit the table the rest of the year.

A clever trick-taking game of "lowest wins", using the 12-days of Christmas as the theme. I try to bring this one out every December, but it doesn't get much play during the rest of the year.

Funny story: I picked up 12 Days of Christmas, hearing that it was a good game. Played it and immediately realized they were talking about this one. Purchased this one, and it ended up being the worst of the two. This game is very elementary, and the way you calculate your scores is a little complicated compared to the game's weight. If given the choice, I'd rather play the similarly-named 12 Days of Christmas.

I'm not sure about this one yet as my opinion is only based on 3 player which could be flawed.  I like the design and flow of the game. But I need to play it more (preferably not with 3 players) to determine if it's not broken. The game seems semi-scripted amongst similar skilled players, the Santa cards allow for kingmaking, and it could be coincidence but it seems whoever gets the Partridge (especially if they have a Turtledove or two) wins.

Fun game that I was able to play with my six-year-old daughter with no issues.  She didn't seem to have a problem with the fact that Christmas was still months away.  Card art nice but cards not the greatest quality.

----- Preliminary thoughts -----
Fast, simple, easily teachable, but no stratregy. Luck driven (the cards you draw dictate your success).

Theme is 100% artificial. 

I don't see myself playing more than a couple of games.

Harmless little trick taking filler game.  Fun for the kiddies, and maybe the right kind of adults.  The card stock on the Gamewright edition is pretty thin, but the art is gorgeous and evocative of the holidays.  
Probably not going to set the gaming world on fire, but if you can score it cheap, definitely worth a look.

RATING: 7
A quick and pretty straight-forward card game with some strategy to it. The illustrations are beautiful and give the game a bit of theming. There is also a nice mix of immediate points vs. end-game points, giving some interesting decisions. I like it, but there's nothing here that is really exciting.

I like this as a good, quick, easy to teach card game to break out when I have non-gamer friends around.  Good for a couple's night after dinner and drinks.  It probably wouldn't be my first option when I'm playing with fellow gamers, though.  The scoring is very interesting - it does a good job at building tension as you get towards the end of the game since later rounds are worth more points.  The game starts to feel "samey" after many plays (like a lot of trick taking games, actually).

Went over well with my family.  It's simple and fast.  There is a depth of strategy that was unexpected.  Simple to learn.  You'll have been able to build a strategy by your second game.

There is an element of luck, but it's manageable.  If your starting hand is full of mid-level cards (5-8) you likely won't be able to dig yourself out.

The game is pretty random.  Purely random play isn't competitive...most of the time. 
With a little card counting, small player counts can be only a little random.  With open hands, it gets more interesting (but you have to be fiddly about how you secretly select a card).

As a family game it's nice, since no plays are illegal.  You may play poorly, but you never get told "you can't do that thing you wanted to do".  And there is so much randomness that adults do not dominate.

for serious gaming:  3/10
for casual gaming:  5/10
for family gaming:  6/10

Excellent game that uses the pyramid deck (one 1, two 2s, three 3s, etc) to fit into the theme perfectly. I eagerly wait Thanksgiving and Christmas every year as an excuse to bring this game and get it to the table 2-3 times. I sometimes bring the game outside of that too, because I like it so much.

02-DEC-2016: Bought this last year after watching Wil Wheaton's Table Top show. Thought that a light card game should do well at work. It's pretty random though, with just a hint of strategy, so sad to say, this had one play and then sat in the game shelf afterwards. Now on my 'For trade' pile.

For a card filler,  you can't do much better than this.  

Fast, fun and portable - this needs to be in your collection.  There are so few Holiday themed games available,  however 12 Days is more than just a novelty. The game offers a good balance between luck and decisions - luck,  in the cards you are dealt / gifted / draw - and decisions on what to play,  what to pass and what to keep for the end game majority scoring.

I can almost guarantee that this will become a staple at your Holiday gatherings,  as it is accessible to all,  with stellar artwork that evokes a feeling of Holiday cheer.  All it lacks are cards that taste like peppermint.  It even works well if you need to combine two decks to accommodate a larger audience... besides,  how often will you ever have the opportunity to actually see a partridge in a pear tree?

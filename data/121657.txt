Much better than it should be!   To be honest, I just didn't think we'd ever see a decent miniatures-based game of air combat;  I realize some people have been doing that for a very long time but that's always been a niche.

Angels 20 makes simple yet "realistic" air combat fun.  It somehow manages to get the scale perfectly right, so that despite a small number of massive 5" hexes, you really do have all the space you need to have a plausible furball.  Sure, there's dice, but maneuvering is entirely up to you and the designer did a good job of projecting real-world maneuvers onto the hexes.

I feel like this is my sweet spot for dogfighting games.  Extremely impressive visually if you toss in some extendo-bases and up the footprint to 10" hexes or so.  I'm a big fan.  This rating and comment is for this and BH; I'd get another point if we had--say--the P-47, Yak-3, ME 262, Curtiss Hawk...

This is probably the best readily available WWII dogfighting game. It's quick and fun, easy to teach but still provides sufficient depth to allow the players to make fairly realistic choices that have an impact on the game. The special maneuvers give some good aerial combat feel and altitude is incorporated (as it should be) but abstracted enough to not get in the way of the fun.

The minis are very nicely done. Some have complained about the planes not having props but personally it's something you get over very quickly. They would have just gotten in the way during game play and made the planes even more of a pain in the butt to store. That's really my only complaint with the game, I have no where to store the planes! The planes are large (1:100 scale). The fighters have a 4 - 5 inch wingspan. The Set I starter comes with a Me 110 with a 6.5" wingspan! WotC has already announced that the Set II starter will have another "large" plane. The starter box is really the only place that anything bigger than your typical fighter will fit. The booster boxes are much smaller.

Medium and heavy bombers are not present in the game but are easy enough to proxy in and develop house rules for if that is your preference. The Set I starter has a Battle of Britain theme and includes German and British planes. The upcoming Set II will have a Pacific theater theme. The rest of the planes come in blind boosters but there is no rarity and no chase pieces. Individual planes are available from online resellers for about $6 - $7 so it's easy enough to pick up just the planes you want if that's what you would like to do. The planes so far in the game come from many different nations that fought in WWII in all theaters so there is plenty of diversity.

Overall a very fun game that you should definitely look into if the subject matter appeals to you at all.

Big, beefy plan models and nice overall rule book.  Maybe I just don't like dog fighting games, but it was really frustrating for me to try to get into the right position to get a shot in before my opponent move out the of the way again.  Nice for the models, though.

This is a fun and light miniature air battle game, though I'm not to fond of collectable games. This one seems easier to get the single planes that you may want, as there are some places to buy them.

The planes are well made and look pretty good. I was shocked, by the large size of them. I still like Wings of War better though.

Actually a pretty decent light WW2 air game, be sure to use the advanced rules which aren't really that hard to implement.  Once you get the modifiers all figured out it can get a bit hard to shoot a plane down.  However, hits do hurt, and being crippled limits your options.

The models themselves are actually much nicer than I thought they would be, and will no doubt see use in other games as well.

So even if you get only the base set, you have a fun air war game with great minis.  Start adding more planes (and hopefully more room!) and you could get some great battles going.

RATING: 7
This game gets a lot more varied and interesting when you start using the "advanced" rules for positioning -- and they are simple enough that you should start using them as quickly as possible.  Without the positioning rules, there is very little reason for planes to climb or dive once they all achieve the same altitude, unless they are damaged and running away.  The advanced rules allow planes in a "diving" aspect to attack targets on their same or one lower altitude with a bonus for the latter.  That makes gaining a height advantage worthwhile, which is absolutely required for realism.  The advanced rules also make turns and climbs more logical and appealing. I still think planes are too easily destroyed instantly using the "Vital Armor" statistic, making a lucky roll a real game-changer.  Also, expanding beyond the basic set is an expensive proposition.

This is an exceptional aerial dogfighting game with collectible miniatures.

As my first foray into a miniature game, A&A: Angels 20 is quite intuitive with its hexagonal movement system. The performance capabilities of the pilot grades as well as the planes are reflected effectively in the maneuver bonuses and special abilities (SAs) awarded to each. With altitude and speed also represented, A&A: Angels 20 covers all of the most important factors in an aerial battle.

This is a great entry point for any gamer into the realm of miniatures. The models are detailed and beautiful to look at. The games are quick to play and rewarding, whichever side you are on!

I also have planes from Bandits High. The WotC rules suck (as far as I'm concerned). However, with close to 250 planes, I continue to use them as I find them very useful using Check Your Six rules.

I have descended down the slippery slope into collectable miniatures gaming. A while ago I got into Axis & Allies Naval Miniatures: War at Sea and have since blown invested blown several hundred dollars on little ships and aircraft. Since then I have tried the newly-released Axis and Allies airforce game and have acquired the starter set and five boosters (so far).

Well, it's a rather fun game and it's very easy to pick up the rules. I have played this with a group of casual gamers (i.e. they like light euros or party games) and they seemed to enjoy zooming around the map trying to get the most out of their machine.

This is, so far, another fun light wargame supported by surprisingly well sculpted and painted miniatures.

Well worth a look if you want fun fast and easy WWII dogfights.

Nice quick game on air combat, about the same complexity of Down in Flames. 
Some of the interesting ideas is the planes have several ratings (Turn, role, climb, dive) used to modify the die roll for a difficult maneuver. This provides allows for planes to have different capabilities. The target aspect modifies the difficultly to hit the target, front on is harder than on the tail. Planes have different hit levels which factor how rugged the plane is. Finally there is a pilot factor that adjust the hit points. 
Sounds like a lot but game plays surprisingly easy. It can be picked up easily. The use of miniatures on stands provide a nice visual experience.

RATING: 10
One of my go to WWII air combat games. Play is fast and exciting with minimal record keeping. Rules are clear with minor chrome and lots of dice. Sure, the aircraft are a little big, but they look great. A20 starter has a nice Battle of Britain-type theme, but the other planes in the series are across theaters. I will play this game anytime.

The only complaint is the initiative system. It is a decisive edge and is decided each turn with a 2d6 roll. I've played entire games without getting it once. House Rule: 1d6 roll to determine initiative. If tied, the player with initiative the previous round surrenders it to his opponent.

Surprisingly good air combat collectible miniatures game. Large pre-painted planes on transparent stands fly about a hex map. Each round starts with a roll for initiative; the losing side moves first and shoots second, with planes from each side alternating activations. Planes moving a certain number of hexes, optionally rolling dice to attempt 1-2 difficult manoeuvres, and raising or lowering altitude (indicated on the base). Shooting is again based on dice, with different probabilities to hit based on the direction of approach -- if possible, best to get behind the enemy.

Not my usual sort of game, but quite an enjoyable dogfight experience that scales well with more players and more planes.

A collectible game that's non-collectible.  Post-preliminary rating and now post-initial impressions on me are very good.  As a tactical air combat minis game it handles critical items such as speed and altitude very well, though abstracted.  Performance will depend on both the aircraft and the quality of the pilot flying it.  I like the way that better pilots gain an edge over less experienced ones and also the way that hits damage your ability to fly and fight.  The extra abilities on the aircraft are nice fluff typical to the AA:M genre and the game uses a point system familiar to all those who have played AA:M games.  Combat damage is handled very similar to AA: Naval Miniatures where exceeding vital armor will result in an instant kill.  There's also a lot of nice options that add more detail to the game play without over complicating things for a minis game.  The models are very good with a few minor detail omissions but very little bending if any (I haven't seen any on mine yet).  At 1/100 scale they're a pretty good size to move and play with.  My biggest complaint is that the map hexes are way too big for the game though the rules take this into account and allow for progressive repositioning to stay on the maps.  If you have any of the AA:M revised maps, they work great for playing as they're perfect in hex size (the original AA:M map hexes are too small for the bases of these aircraft).  So overall, I'm pretty impressed given that I had no hopes for this game at all when it was first announced.  Finally, the mix in the initial set is good given they stuck to 1939-1941 for most of the aircraft and went with the more commonly produced models for the nations included.  It's not a problem playing with multiples of the same aircraft on one team and one of the best decisions I've seen was inclusion of all the cards from this set in the starter.  With the cards, you could even use aircraft from other games and it won't affect play.

I'm not seeing a lot of downside to the game since most dogfights will probably involve 2-4 aircraft per side.  You'll be able to field a few good aircraft for say Expeditionary Italians against the Russians without the sky turning into a kaleidoscope of different nations and colors.  The good mix of aircraft will allow you to fight battles over Russia, the Pacific and Far East, and of course the skies over Britain.  All good stuff and good fun.

The starter comes with 2 Hurricanes, 1 Spit, 2 Me109's and 1 Me110, which is plenty to play a fun Battle of Britain scenario.

EDIT: I'm gaining appreciation for the larger hex size which I originally opposed. Given that multiple aircraft might be in one hex, the larger size makes sense. It is still better to pair up four map sections to play on but not neccessary unless fighting it ou with a large number of aircraft. Plus if you throw in a few homemade bomber models at 1/100 scale it's nice to have the larger map hexes. Upping my rating by a few more tenth's of a point.

I got this base set, and a few of the expansion sets. Our game group played it for awhile but one felt the small map (that came with the base game made this game a little to unrealistic. I cannot paint to games with pre-painted miniatures always interested me, and I thought game was fun and easy to play.

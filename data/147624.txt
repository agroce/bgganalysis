Some subtle changes have improved on [b]K2[/b] slightly (the clients, the better control over your blue cards), but I felt the theme was a little silly with the guides: they were essentially immortal.  They suffered no penalties but still took up space.  Weird.

RATING: 7
Picks up where K2 left off, adding a more brutal mountain, a pickup and deliver mechanism, and some light deck building. This is a tough one, as it should be, a gamer's game that requires repeated plays to tame it.

The theme is strong, although some abstractions (like superhuman guides) exist. There are a lot of nuances to the game that are not apparent to start with, both strategic and tactical. Decisions are tough and pivotal for success, and a modicum of luck is needed too. Limited player interaction, but thoroughly engaging gameplay. Bonus points for being able to use the map with K2 as well. Minus points for stopping short of making the game even more complex and epic by increasing the deck building aspect. Disappointing that there is no official solo mode.

A very good design, but the theme and tension is not as thick as in K2, so will let this go.

Players take control of a team of two expert mountaineers who must lead as many tourists as they can to the peak and, of course, safely bring them back. Each player gets an identical deck of cards that are used for moving around the board. Players must decide where to set up camps and how much oxygen to bring to the top; only oxygen lets players get acclimatization cards, which allow tourists to survive the climb. Players must also decide what type of customers they want: the athletic, fairly competent climbers, or the wealthier and more prestigious amateurs. Climbing with one tourist in tow is easy, but the key to victory lies in guiding whole groups. Unfortunately, the more people you take with you, the higher the likelihood is of something going wrong. Also, as it is in the mountains, the weather will be a crucial factor. If a player can coordinate an expedition that avoids a crisis at the peak, he should be able to lead the happy tourists back to base.
K2 is more expensive

I bought this because I couldn't find K2.  I basically play K2 using this board and components.  I really like this game when played as K2,  but haven't ever really learned how to play the actual Mount Everest game.

Pros:
- the game is relatively thematic in the sense that it feels we are climbing a difficult mountain.
- I like the deck building mechanic that helps you get more acclimatised as the game progresses
- the core mechanics revolve around risk management, with the weather forecast, risk tokens, altitude and acclimatisation. That part is quite well modelled and is relatively exciting.
- the board looks good

Cons:
- most of the mechanics are quite dated and lack imagination. For instance, I find it quite pointless to have 2 characters per player, as you can (and will) allocate all actions to one of them. The other one feels like hanging around doing nothing.
- very little player interaction. The only one is that you can not share a space. Not even very thematic as expeditions do tend to build camps together.
- we are meant to organise an expedition on Everest but this theme does not really transpire very well. Do not expect to learn about expeditions on this mountain or feel like you are part of one.
- the mechanic involving tiles simulating the icefall just above Camp 1 is a joke.
- you can score these clients you got to the summit on the last day of the climbing season. What about them getting down alive ? Anti-thematic..
- the art on the cards, the meeples and the clients tokens are not meeting my expectations.

The designer is an enthusiastic mountaineer - I think with this game he wants to warn every tourist to climb the Mount Everest! If you want to play an extraordinary brutal game with less interaction where most of the times the winner is the mountain, then you're right - I use the board as an expansion for K2 which is much more fun!!!

Mount Everest is a brutal game that will punish inexperienced players, even when played with the easiest settings. I expect this is by design. After all, climbing the world's tallest mountain shouldn't be easy, even for the experienced Sherpas you play as. 

While not co-operative in any sense, players are largely playing against the game, not against each other. Player interaction is limited to "other people being in your way" and they will likely be too focused on their own goals to do this intentionally. The highest score wins the game, and so it seems it would even be possible to play this game solo. 

Strangely, despite the grueling climb (which may see players only making a couple trips up and down the mountain in the course of the game), points are few and far between. Only a successful round trip will score points and an unsuccessful one will lose more points than it would have gained if successful. A more granular scoring system would probably work better here, especially for newer players who may find the scores tied 3/4ths of the way through the game yet with absolutely no time to score any more points.  

It has a very different feel than many other race or resource-management games, even though certain elements of the theme don't really come though very well (oxygen rules are bizarre). This is definitely not a game for everyone, but I found myself intrigued by the difficulty and wanting to play the tougher settings almost immediately. The fun of this game truly lies in overcoming the challenge; perhaps the theme comes through stronger than it would seem after all.

PL: Gra polegająca na bieganiu z dołu na górę, prowadzeniu ludzi za kasę, noszeniu namiotów czy innych butli. Należy zwracać uwagę na pogodę i stosować się do ilości punktów ruchu na kartach. Któryś z Twoich klientów zginie? Nie martw się - nieśmiertelny alpinista zejdzie po kolejnych :). Instrukcja momentami niejasna, nogłaby być dokładniejsza. Plus za możliwość wykożystania wraz z K2.

Just like K2 before it, Mount Everest probably has a long lifetime thanks to a double sided board and adjustable difficulty level. It's not the same game as K2, but still you get a similar experience which might be a bit more refined even.

*每人拿對應顏色的圖版跟所有標記24張牌，兩個不同登山米寶放在圖板起點，一個放在記分區5分處，隨機左到右放置，牌庫將6張適應牌洗勻放在另外一疊，剩下的洗勻為起始牌庫，並抽6張
*遊戲共進行18輪，分數高獲勝，平手記分區左邊的獲勝，一輪5階段
1.卡牌選擇 手牌6選3或直接蓋著，全部選完一起打開(此階段可丟棄在帳棚的氧氣筒根據緯度6-7:1/7-8:2/>8:3 抽適應牌選1張其他放回適應牌庫頂，然後蓋著移除選擇那張牌以外的任意手牌)
2.根據出的牌總和向上點數最多的必須選一個危險板塊，並在階段3使用，平手都不用選，然後再開一張，行動階段根據上面數字減對應移動點數或是適應點數，可分配在不同張牌上
3.行動階段 起始玩家開始，分別使用3張牌來行動，1張牌的行動不能分給兩個米寶做
>在基地能帶帳篷(前三格)，氧氣筒(第一個要前兩格之後一格，不同緯度能帶的上限也不同)，顧客，兩個同色米寶間傳遞，不需花費牌，或是放帳棚，從帳棚拿
>東西都可隨意棄，顧客扣3/4分
>根據地圖綠點花點數移動，沒有就是1點，也可花對應點數放帳篷
>移動停留是根據不同緯度人數不同，可經過不停留，也可兩個自己米寶同時移動交換位置
>移到冰塊區根據開的狀況決定，花點數移動或是退回
>增加適應力是同個帳篷全部或是某個人身上顧客全部一起加
>到頂時根據顧客拿2/3分，顧客翻面，如果又到底在拿2/3分，分數每次移動都在該格的最左邊
>天氣狀況可能導致不能移動
4.適應檢查 根據所在位置跟天氣狀況對應緯度調整適應值(藍+紅-帳篷+1)，之後調整回顧客最大值4/3，顧客掛點掉分，分數最低在1
5.回合結束 起始標記左傳，天氣標記右移，如果移到另外一塊就開一塊新的，每個人抽3張，要等到所有牌抽完才洗牌重抽6張(6/12回合)

It's a good idea, but I think this lacks a few things where K2 excelled. First of all, there's a bit more upkeep due to each of your guides picking up and dropping oxy tanks, clients etc.

On top of that, and this is very much IMHO, your guides being invincible and the only thing worth caring about being your clients somehow makes this a bit less interesting than K2. K2 always felt like a massive battle against the weather and the tactics of your fellow players - On Mount Everest, I couldn't really get that same connection. The game felt too long and not that exciting even in the higher slopes of Everest.

An excellent, thematic game about mountain climbing. It builds on the mechanics of K2 and adds some management with oxygen tanks and having a team of climbers that you're getting up the mountain to build a great gamer's game with more tension and strategy. The nice bonus is that this can also be played with the simpler rules of K2, so there's no reason really to get K2 if you own this.

K2 for gamers, but ME is more random (icefall and acclimatization).

There are two mainchanges to K2. You don`t have acclimatization cards in your deck, you must get the cards during the game and there is a new scoring (points for every tourist who climbs the mountain and then getting back to the base and minus points for every tourist that died).

I don`t like getting the acclimatization cards. You really need them. You can get the cards at random. It could be a 1, 2 or 3. If you get only the 1 you can`t win the game. Yhat is too much randomness in a gamers game.

quite complicated if you study it alone, but after a while, the rules become clear enough (but they aren't explained well in the rulebook).
As in K2, here you find, by far, one of the most thematic game ever. Here every aspect seems to have been managed in the proper way. A very nice experience even if you need to remember some details. It would be an 8 with better explained rules and a faster game.
How is it possible to reach 45 points is a mistery.

GAME: Quartermaster General: Victory or Death – The Peloponnesian War
RANK: 2626

RATING: 8
A good game.  Probably a bit easier to play than the WW2 version.  The close team-play gives it an extra dimension.  The 4 sides are very different - Athens needing to stall, Sparta slowly making it's juggernaut, Corinth doing a bit of everything, Delians racking up points whilst helping Athens defend.  The art work is strong and attractive.

Only played at two players twice. Very good experience with lots of Peloponesian War flavour. 

The player skill will increase with deck knowledge of each faction. 
As each match is of short duration of time, players can play two games in a evening.

Suprisingly simple system that can be played in less than 2 hours!

RATING: 9.54
First game was dull because I lost my only city before game was even halfway. Then there was not much to do. Note to self: don't lose your last city. 

After that games have been better. Having much cards prepared helps but risks deck running out. Also it means that you have to discard good cards as most of cards are very usefull. Having to decide wheter you keep a card for future or simply discard it to have better now is problematic in good manner.

When QG: WWII appeared, its fluid, fast playing and broad brush approach to global warfare seemed fresh and invigorating.  So much so that many of us forgave some significant issues with the luck of the card draw and a few too many "do this if you have the card" non-decisions.  I find myself less forgiving of the second iteration of the QG system, despite some efforts to reduce the luck element (more scope to play prepare cards and less costly trawling through your deck) and to open up the game (bribery tokens allowing new cities to be founded anywhere, lower unit density).

Production quality is mostly good.  Only the miniatures disappoint, particularly the bendy speared hoplites.  The map and card artwork looks very appealing.

Played once, got the rules wrong but still enjoyed. "Mustering in place" was the cause for confusion as we interpreted that completely wrong. After a second read of the manual everything is clear. I believe that if I never played a QMG title before understanding would have actually been easier. However the rulebook  could use some rework and more focus on important rules, is too condensed as it is. Production value is good, but cards need to be sleeved as they get easily marked. Finally, why this box size? Is twice as big as it could have been and make the game so much less portable...After a couple of plays my appreciation for the game is skyrocketing. So dynamic and fun as long as you know the decks and work with your partner without giving the opponents too much information!

I lost my taste for wargames long ago and in general don't care for direct conflict games at all (I like euro games). This made me realise I can make exceptions - now I'm curious to try out the other Quartermaster General games. Simple, elegant card-driven design, no dice, team play. Nice historical ambience, although no doubt much of the thematic appeal is going to be lost if you're not familiar with ancient Greek history.

Strong card manipulation game. This is one of those games that can only get better with more plays as you learn what the various strategies are for each power, how cards can build on others, and develop stronger board positions. Unless a broken strategy is discovered this one is very good and makes me want to try Quatermaster General.

First impressions extremely positive; I rate QMG a 10, so this gets that rating also. Supply rules are a little tricky as usual, but shouldn't be too bad once you get your head around them. The card decks are a super-interesting upgrade from the original, and the new tactical and card-spending options are great. And it actually does a better job at evoking the history of the Peloponnesian War than QMG did for WWII. Anyway, early days still, but hugely promising.

RATING: 4
This game is an odd one for me. The idea sounds great but the Quartermaster General system frustrates me and provides little satisfaction. It doesn't feel like I can properly plan and whenever I have to ditch cards I really want to save it feels agonizing in a bad way. I feel my options slowly ticking away and know that the game's drawing close to ending and I never get a sense of fulfillment.

I also really dislike the combat and how it's very tit for tat with a lack of dynamic plays. It feels slow and sluggish and I want something more vibrant and alive.

I see no reason to play this over Cyclades or Mare Nostrum: Empires.

Very nice components - lovely mounted board, decent plastic, good quality cards.
Game play is straightforward. Needed to use BGG for clarification of some rule elements. Playing solo is quite easy as you can't always remember what hand the other powers have got (at least, I can't!). Knowledge of cards will help, so first game was a bit of a learning game and one for making mistakes. There is a lot of replayability as each game will vary due to the card play. A welcome addition to my 'ancient battles' games collection.

After our initial two session playing of about 6 games (all 4 player) I'd say that Ian Brody has created another masterpiece.

This is THE game for folks who love Quartermaster General but want a little more in the way of strategic and tactical options. Plus, it only requires 4 players!

If you hated playing Japan (with all its Response cards) then you may not enjoy this version quite so much as every player has quite a few Prepare cards (the analog to Response cards) to plan around.

Highly recommended otherwise.

Sadly, I think this is a miss. Supply is so much more complicated in this game than QG, it's irksome. In QG, you trace through your own pieces always, to a star. Navies also require an adjacent friendly Army to be in supply. This is super simple and sometime even this confuses new players. 

In this game, you trace supply through supplied spaces, and boats have no effect on supply. A land space needs a friendly piece or Bribery token. A sea space needs to be adjacent to a land space with a friendly piece or Bribery token. When you build (sorry, muster!) or battle, you need to trace to your own city (unless it's a muster in place), otherwise it can be a friendly city. It's a hot mess and it confuses me at times, and that's coming from someone who understands and teaches the rules.

The fact that cities can pop up randomly means the goalposts move too much for my liking, and I am not a fan of scoring every 3 rounds. Scoring at the end of rounds helps the last player too much, too. I also miss the wooden bits.

It's a shame. I really wanted the 4-player game to be good as I often struggle to get 6 together for QG.

I am just not a fan of these scripted games, preferring a game with open ended actions. Having to draw a specific card to perform what seems a standard action (create unit, move unit, or attack with unit) is very irritating. Mixed with the idea that players effectively need to memorize everyone's deck is simply not entertaining (several of the cards direct you to specifically interact with regions of the map, but knowing when to play them requires knowing how they interact with other player's cards).

I just don't get who would enjoy slogging through this for what little payoff there is. I do dig the asymmetrical nature of the player decks and plastic units, so that is something I guess?

RATING: 9
Surprising medium weight team wargame here (an underserved side of the hobby). I'm quite pleased with this one after my first two plays, and I look forward to our plays getting better the more we learn the decks. 

I say "surprising" because it was more thinky than I thought after my experience with the WWII version of the QMG series. Clearly, the designer has found ways to give the players both a wider and deeper range of decisions. On that note, I look forward to trying the WWII version again with the expansions as well as the WWI version.

I was concerned that Corinth and Sparta were woefully underpowered but we pulled out a narrow victory in our second game on the last turn. You need to realize that Athens, while terribly powerful, is quite limited on land with only 3 build-troops cards. You should seriously threaten Athens (the city) as the game goes on as Sparta has a lot of cards for troop creation and maneuverability. Corinth plays the support role (we won by taking Athens on the last turn as Athens had nobody there).

My only knock is that the supply rules are quite opaque and require the table to help keep everybody on track. Otherwise, it plays in a crisp 2 hours and has very satisfying decisions.

Was hoping that this system would work better with a smaller conflict, and it IS a tighter design, but it still suffers from a similar problem: some powers are much less interesting than others, and holding two hands of cards is annoying. This should have been a REAL two-player game.

Quartermaster à 4 joueurs. Le système est un peu plus complexe que dans l'original, mais toujours aussi bon!

Components: good quality on board, cards and tokens
Complex: easy to learn and control
Weight: light
Players: 4
Length: less than 90 mins
Mechanics: area control, take that, partnerships
Decisions: not much but enough (which card to play, and when, where to go...)
Opinion: good game about the Peloponnese Wars.
In play 4 powers, 2 Demos and 2 Oligarcs and all of them are in play, and you fight to score points controlling cities in the map, keeping your supply line.
What you do on your turn? You have a deck with X cards (different for each power), and you start with a hand of 7, from those, you play 1 each turn, and draw again.
One thing you have to take care of your deck, if you run out of cards, your team will loose points for each card you have to draw and cannot.
As said, in your turn you play one card, check your supply lines and, every 3 turns, score points for your team. The card you play can be to muster a hoplite/ trireme with the appropriate supply, prepare for some circumstances, start a fight or prepare some bonuses for your power.
The scoring is depending on cities you control, and they must be supplied, so if you loose the supply line and cannot recover it... all your troops are out.
In a nutshell, a fast game to be played sometimes, offers enough fun and enough decisions. Easy to learn and start playing immediately.

RATING: 8
Based on a readthrough of the rules, not actual play. 

This quartermaster looks more like a wargame and less like a game. Novel mechanics - which haven't migrated to the QMG:1914 game - namely the possibility to draft specific Prepare cards significantly reduces randomicity, but also require previous knowledge of the deck. 

All in all this looks like a fascinating game for a fascinating subject matter.

Components are marvellous and I love the graphics and the art. 

UPDATE
Played the first time. Man, the rules are maybe the most difficult to digest of all the QMs published, but action is guaranteed and it is very strategic. A real jewel of a game especially for a wargamer. Can't wait to play more.

We're all very happy to play again.

It's improved compared to QMG WW2 version with players doing more on their turn and getting glorious combos down.

Minus points were mostly from the randomness of the cards and the lack of control. We had games where Delian League had all status cards at the bottom of the deck and it can't really generate points without - if you rotate through cards then Corinth will make you discard into minus bazillion points. If you don't, you simply are useless.
Equally the limited muster and battle cards always feel like you didn't really battle as much as you did in QMG and that you're missing out on it.

Only played a couple of times, but it just didn't grab me in the same way as the original QMG or, for that matter, QMG 1914. The Peloponnesian War seems to be a hard conflict to make an interesting game of, and this doesn't quite succeed. Most disappointing was the physical presentation of the game - those plastic minis are very cheap!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice clear rulebook and some interesting game play.  The game plays a little slower than QMG: WW2.  

The hoplite plastic pieces are functional but have curvy spears and are leaning at odd angles.  The column markers (kickstarter only) are hopelessly poor and architecturally incorrect.  Other pieces are good.  The card text is black on a brown background, and the important text is in a smaller font than the flavour text, so readability is an issue for me.

Having said that I've done a bit of painting of figures and am considering doing paste-ups of the cards to make them easier to read.

1 play only, more open-ended and freewheeling than the original WW2 QMG game, and on a less-frequently-gamed topic. I can see Sparta making a land assault on Athens in most games, but what happens at sea and on the islands varying a lot game by game. Hand management is all - what / when to discard, what to lay down for future benefit (hidden or public), when to dig into the draw deck all make keen food for thought.

Meh. I LOVE the Pelopponesian wWwrs. I LOVE Quartermaster General. But what works for the world of industral warfare fails in ancient times. 

Little flexibility, boring events, and very small decks makes for a boring game. There are so few units and the city restrictions mean even if you are able to pop up in a new theater, you have nowhere to go, and nothing to do.

I hate the cards, dark with awful text making it hard to read. Personally I prefer the wooden pieces to plastic ones where the hoplite spearscare all bent, the the trireme masts in danger of breaking off.

The game screams out for more options, such as adding a third team, Persia and Carthage. I get the feeling more is already available, but left on the cutting room floor for additional profit in the new world of selling a marginal core game, and offering expansind to maximize profit.

Overall: boring, poor components.its only saving grace is that it covers one of my favorite time periods, albiet very poorly.

Peloponnesian War is always a good subject to game.  This is no exception.  Epic, classical, surprising streamlined system which can tell a very good narrative story.  I enjoy many moments during the game.  The supply problems to both sides are very vivid to tell and something to ponder with.

So difficult to comment on this game...
In short, this is not a reskin of Quartermaster General. If you love QMG, there is a significant though small possibility that you will find this game too long and heavy.
There are minor tweaks on the QMG rules everywhere, and when combined together the end-product is a much more thinky game. The supply rules change making the fleet can be mustered at much longer distance.
My only conern being that this game, despite its much heavy gameplay, may not attract traditional wargamers, while the multiple actions per turn is going to scare away casual players.

Just make sure your final city doesn't get destroyed!

The Quartermaster General Series is moved to a 4 player game of Athens  and Delion League versus Sparta and Corinth.  It's probably the most complex, as you can use bribery tokens to set up supply for your triremes or hoplites.  There are also prepare cards which you can play down on your turn. 

I always enjoying playing the different decks to see  their different powers and advantages. There is a good historical feel to this as well, as the Spartans had hoplites which were almost unbeatable on land, but the Athenians had triremes which were unbeatable at sea. 

I enjoyed this game. The rating is likely to rise after more plays. I'm looking forward to trying all the different nations.

The game is a very bad simulation of the war. It is more an abstract area-control card driven game played by chance on a central meditterranian map. The Spartans can not move because the area is occupied by an allied unit!!! Come on! The Spartans can not build a ship because the sea is occupied???? No army movement? In that age? I could go on and on...

It gets one extra star due to the nice flavour text in the cards, that together with the map is the only thing historical in the game...

After one game of this, I think it's very enjoyable and it could get better with more plays. It's possible I'd increase this score to an 8 (high for me). My worry would be that it plays to a bit of a formula.

It's a fun and elegant mix of strategy, tactics, teamwork etc distilled into very slim rules. Downtime is low too, which is great.

It is an abstract map-area-control card game rather than a 'proper' wargame.

Familiarity with dozens of unique cards in players' decks is integral to the game. However, it's still fun for new (i.e. unfamiliar) players. Mercifully there's a lot of hidden information, which prevents excessive analysis or card-counting. 

(Someone on BGG has also kindly provided a printable reference sheet about important cards too. The game could probably be made easier for new players if someone stuck about 50 little coloured stickers all over the board to indicate what areas each deck/nation can most easily attack, score points from or build cities in. But that's probably a step too far and would ruin the lovely map!)

My concern is around how constrained you are by your current card draw (you draw back up to seven cards after your turn). It's hard to plan actions far ahead or to fully anticipate what map locations will suddenly become 'victory point goals'. Players expecting a lean update of conventional strategy/war games might be surprised by the amount of uncertainty generated by the cards.

Overall, managing your cards is a nice balance between random, skill and some foresight.

Replayability is probably high too, thanks to: the asymmetric decks; learning-curve about the cards; flexible approaches to managing your cards; and widely varying order in which 'events' occur (via the decks). Good stuff.

I might implement a house rule to make sure victory point cards are not all at one end of any card decks, as that can significantly change your chance of winning. Easily done by shuffling each deck in two halves (each with a balance of victory point hards) then putting them together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Improves on the already finely-honed Quartermaster General system by providing  more control and strategic options. The ability to place a Prepare card in addition to a standard play action makes for tougher decisions and enhances long-term planning. Conflict is wide-ranging rather than channelled, with opportunities and threats across the map. The four decks each provide a rich menu of options without prescribing play. 

And there's much more history built into Victory or Death than a game that's basically a dozen pages of rules and four decks of cards has any right to. Sicily is an enticing but tenuous prize. The islands of the Ionian are a cluster-bomb of crisis. Sparta pounds on the gates of Athens while the Athenians desperately try to hold onto gains elsewhere. 

This system absolutely nails briskly-playing historical conflict with a remarkable amount of nuance and depth for such a simple system. Inspires a stronger 'let's play again' impulse than any games I can think of.

However, as with the other entries in the system, this is a game where you will be remorselessly violated by your opponents. Card actions are powerful and often devastating. Some locations on the map are crucial to certain powers generating VP, so knowing the decks is vital. This is a game (and system) best played with a regular group who learn the decks and powers together.

After all this years after 300 (and all those six packs), now it's the time for you to feel like a spartan without need to show your belly in cosplay.

I'm a big fan of the original game, but I find Victory or Death has fallen completely flat for me. I think a lot of it comes down to the inflexibility of being tied to cities. Lose a city, or don't have a city in the right place? You're probably unable to do much on a turn.

In the original game, you can pretty much always do *something.* In this game, too many times I feel like I can do nothing.

RATING: 9.5
An intensely strategic game with a few important differences from Quartermaster General, but similar enough that experienced QG players will pick this up in minutes. As with QG, play is simple, but the interaction between various cards adds a level of complexity that will have you cackling with glee over a sweet combination or weeping bitterly when your opponents bring your plans to ruin.  As such, the decision-making is harrowing and the reversals of fortune can be staggering, yet game play takes about 90 minutes. Meaty enough for the die-hard strategist, yet light enough for the more casual gamer.

While I like the Quartermaster General system overall, there's something that never sat right with me about it.

Each faction has certain key cards in their deck that they need to draw early in order to do their best. Sometimes those cards will be on the bottom of the deck. That's just life. The bad part is that there are quite a few cards that force other factions to discard from their deck. Now not only do you have to hope to draw the right cards at the right time, but you have to hope they don't get completely discarded at random. I really don't like that level of randomness.

The game has a solid foundation with the faction-based team play and the simple "play a card, draw a card" gameplay. But the take-that discard effects just feel really out of place.

Sold.

Evolution of some rules (such as Prepare cards) from original QMG is definitely an improvement in the system.  The extremely esoteric titles of many cards means you end up ignoring them and just talking about the mechanics, though, and if you're not familiar with the era and geography it's much less accessible than the original.  We'll see how it goes with more plays.

Summary; if you liked QMG:WW2 you will love this, assuming you're comfortable with the change of era. Griggling Games have refined their ruleset, and smoothed out the rough edges of WW2. If you were ambguous about WW2, your are likely to really like VoD, based on our experience. If you hated QMG:WW2, then QMG:VoD is a similar game - if your concerns are among those addressed by the changes, it may be worth picking up, but if not whatever you disliked about the original may still apply here

I liked that you do not roll dice to decide battles. Very strategic gameplay and well balanced. I quite enjoyed playing it, although it was not the best strategy game I've played so far

I like this a lot.  After 5 plays the game seems balanced between the teams, and each time it's told a different story of the war - even though the cards are, I think, more specific than in QMG, it's less predictable which ones will get played in any particular game. Annoyingly, unlike QMG I still haven't internalised the sea supply rules and so have to think through each check I make.

Very good, advanced gamers-game version of Quartermaster General.

We began our afternoon play with 'Victory or Death' , the Peloponnesian War equivalent of 'Quartermaster General'. There were a few changes to the mechanics, the most significant of which, was that the line of supply rules were relaxed so that nations only had to trace an uninterrupted line of supply across any available land or sea route, which I hope is the correct interpretation. I also liked the fact that the card hand spread for each of the four nations; Athens, Corinth, Delian League and Sparta. Additionally, the specific card explanations for the 'prepare' actions were summarised on the reverse of each nation's sheet. A significant improvement on the 'QM' game in my view. Corinth and Sparta, as the oligarchical nations side together, against the democratically run; Athens and the Delian League. The card draws are the same as before, initially selecting seven from the ten drawn, so the card spread table helps players with this decision, particularly as three of us had not played before. 'Prepare' cards are like status cards, except, you have to discard one card to put into play, and these activate when the condition is met. Status cards are available as are event cards. My observation is that the democrats have more event styled cards that provide additional victory points if the conditions are met. I did not see any of these in the Spartan deck and Pete H did not seem to have any either. I only mention this because the victory points tally was low at seventeen compared to the oligarchs at around twelve or so. (The Democrats were victorious as the Spartans simply couldn't hoover enough enemy hopilites off the board once the Delian league rebellion event card took place in Lacedaemonia - my bad). Nations score for acquired and/or retained cities at the end of every third game turn and the game is played over fifteen turns. It is also possible to use bribery to maintain supply lines as well if you run out of hopilites! The forces available vary from nation to nation, so Athens has more triremes and Sparta has more hopilites, and the card decks reflect that. It is also fair to say that Sparta's city is worth three victory points whereas most of the others are one and two so that does give an advantage provided it is not lost to conflict! In our game, Corinth tried to seize control of the seas, waging war on Athens, and with the help of the Delian League, won this part of the war. Marginally. They did sink my one foray into the water. Spartans are not meant to float.....I enjoyed the game, and next time, would like to play the democrats. The nations were chosen randomly at the beginning of the game.

Good application of the QG system to this period.  Supply is critical but can be assisted by your ally.

After just one game there are pros and cons with respect to QG. I like it that you don't need 6 players anymore, 4 is much easier to come by. 
Bribery gives more  flexibility,
On the other hand, musterability and suplliability seem more complicated.
Sparta and Corinth seem to tread on their feet a lot

Like the original, the follow-up earns a massive shrug and eye roll.  Yes, there are improvements over the WW2 version, but not enough to keep my peepers from drifting upwards.

Both QG and VoD are incremental tugs-of-war where the winning team is determined not by strength, not by holding ground, and not by clever play - but simply by staying awake longer than your opponents.  Yawn.

The bare bones approach is the equivalent of someone compressing your lifetime into a high-speed highlights reel. Sure, it would be an unusual ten minute diversion, but then you're dead and that's it.  I would prefer to - you know - live out my actual life in real time.  Messy details and all.

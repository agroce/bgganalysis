If you enjoy worker placement style games, this is a good one. Has a great balance of luck versus strategy and the frustration level - even if you aren't winning - is pretty low.

RATING: 6.8
My biggest gripe with this game is that the unevenness of the graphic design. Cards and box cover look lush but the boards and other components feel incredibly bland. Beyond that it's a solid worker placement concept where you are expanding and refreshing your personal fairy realms with various essences and elements, while hoping you can pay the upkeep and not have them fall into Deep Sleep. Almost like a Lords of Waterdeep or something for pixies and sprites, or people who read too much Shakespeare?!

Take Agricola and make a pleasant game of fables and fairy tales, and you have the delightful Upon a Fable game. 

Its the Agricola play style without the dreary, grueling, angst fed soul wrenching of Agricola (win or lose).

awesome game, great intro to other like agricola. Made polymer clay resources, will make player pawns eventually. not the greatest worker placement out there, but will keep in collection because the theme is great and artwork is beautiful. It's one I really like and my husband feels we have "outgrown"

It's a lighter, happier, less punishing, re-themed version of Agricola. I do prefer it over Agricola, as these things appeal to me. The box quality is nice, but the card stock is some of the flimsiest I have ever seen, and the game boards are thin and warped. (I bought this new from Kickstarter, and it came that way.) The meeples from the Tree of Wonders upgrade are nice, as well they should be for the price I paid for it. I also got the New Kingdoms expansion from the Kickstarter package, but I haven't tried it yet. It's a good game, but I really expected more for the approximately $100 that I spent.

Seems to be heavily luck driven, and overall pretty nasty for such a whimsical theme.   The game is also a bit on the long side, and the art and graphic design could really use a face lift.  Perhaps some icons on those Ever After cards?   It's impossible to know their powers at a glance.

I've written a review explaining my extreme dislike of this game: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1092262/first-impressions-never-again

Basically, it feels like a copy of Agricola, except that the theme is completely pasted on. And you can only take the equivalent of a Family Growth action if you happen to draw the required card. If you don't, you'll just sit there doing nothing while the other players get more and more turns each round....

RATING: 7
A worker placement game that relies quite a bit on luck of draw, but the card play is pretty clever. The theme is fun and light-hearted, and the artwork captures the mood very well. However, don't let the theme fool you. This game can get really mean and that room for player interaction is what drives the game and will keep it interesting.

A lesser version of Agricola... especially when I saw the scoring cards. lol

I'd rather play Agricola, at least it's not a clone of something else, it's genuine.

Don't buy this if you don't like Agricola / Caverna, and don't buy this if you do have Agricola / Caverna.

Played this with the New Kingdoms expansion included (7 players). What a mess of a game! Agricola Worker Placement, mixed with cardplay and a lot of take that cards. Example: I wanted to upgrade a large realm to an Epic realm /which I needed for scoring a Ever afer card), but the 2 upgrade spaces was already taken, so I Went for the first player space, so I could upgrade next turn. Turns out one guy had a card that could make him decide which other player becomes Start Player, so my entire action of Starting Player was wasted, and I was back to probably not upgrading... JUNK!

Possibly this game works better with fewer players, and more importantly without the expansion, because all the new cards makes it so much harder to get realm cards, which you desperaly need to be able to get more workers...

Purchased half price when milsims was selling it cheap. This was just after discovering Rahdo Runs Through and him gushing about the agonizing decisions you have to make. I can see the similarities to Agricola, however the decisions aren't that difficult, and if you don't draw small realms you can get screwed. If I had young daughters instead of sons it might have been worth keeping.

RATING: 6.8
Got on Kickstarter!

Rate based on a 7-player game.

We messed up with the setup (2 fables and randomly dealt cards for each player) and this mistake hampered the early game (on round 3 we subtracted a fable from everybody to fix it up). The board got so crowded that some players didn't have anywhere to put their fables at the start of the game, and one player didn't have small realms for like 2 or 3 rounds.

Ok, we played it wrong on the beginning, but we still got the general feeling of the game. Some friends liked it, but I was not impressed at all.

This is a worker placement game with some take thats (a lot of take thats if playing with the expansion). It's very very hard to improve your kingdom if you don't play like 8+ Ever After cards, and you can only play them if you happen to draw them!

I don't know. I have to give this game some other tries with other numbers of players. 4 players is probably the sweet spot for this one. But i'm not sure if it would really be so sweet.

Agricola is so much better than this game. For now, there is no way I'm going to compare them.

Comparisons to Agricola are unavoidable. The cardplay could be a good idea in theory, but it also adds some randomness and take-that. The Blessings and Curses also add randomness and can really mess with your plans. 

What really annoys me is the completely pasted-on theme. `I play a Dream! It lets me ... exchange 3 Magic for 1 Castle´. `OK, cool, I play a Dream too. Eh ... it´s got the same illustration as yours, and it lets me ... exchange one Love for two Magic´. `OK, that´s ... I don´t know ...´.

Theme is utterly non-existent here. The artwork is uninspired and repetitive. There are much better worker placement games out there.

This is a nice worker placement game with some card drafting elements. You are building up your fairy tale kingdom, trying to gather wonders (resources) to build realms, play dream cards, and ever after cards. You want small realms to expand your worker pool, large/epic realms and ever after cards to gain special abilities and score more bonus points, and have enough resources both to power your realms throughout the game and to score points at the end of the game.

The drafting element comes in the beginning of each round when players draw three cards, and chooses which to keep for themselves, which to hand over to another player and which to discard. This can become a tough decision as you might unknowingly help your opponent out a lot by giving them exactly what they need, and vice versa.

At first glance it might seem like players who can add realms early have a bigger advantage, but my experience was that even though my opponent struggled to get his realms out the first few rounds while I easily both expanded and upgraded, he instead accumulated and played a lot of ever after cards which gave him so many special powers he was hoarding resources most of the time. In the end of the game, there was just a single point separating us. And I personally really like it when there's not an end all be all way to do things. I do think I will stick to playing this as a two-player game since you at least get to start with two workers, I cannot imagine playing this with only one worker at the beginning of the game, it would make it too biased towards whoever is starting player.

I backed this on Kickstarter hoping for so much more. It plays and feels like an unfinished prototype. The art is beautiful but it is apparent that WAY more time was spent on the art and bits than on the gameplay itself. 

It comes across as disjointed and feels like certain mechanics where just thrown in at the last minute. Also, the theme feels very pasted on. There is no narrative, no story about the kingdoms. I have no ideas why a certain card allows me to convert 2 magic to 1 honor. There is no flavor to the game at all.

There is a really great game here, I can feel it. I just wish the designers had actually spent some more time in development to finish the game than rushing it to Kickstarter.

A streamlined, fast-playing game using the Agricola engine, but lacking the balance, variety, and replayability.  Surprisingly unthematic, due to a dearth of art (same picture for every card of a single type), and lack of integration (resources are effectively identical except for scarcity).  The game makes forces the players to insert the actual storyline of their kingdoms - why does this card cause me to lose a castle to gain a follower?  The art is the same as all the others - I guess I'll need to make the story myself.

Game balance is badly skewed based on access to early realm cards, how easily played they are, and where you sit in turn order.  Adding a small realm doubles your total workers for your worker placement, and gives you the second worker to play on the same turn that you got it.  This leads to exponential gains without a catch-up mechanism  If you sit late in turn order, it is prohibitively expensive (your entire turn, doing nothing else in the worker placement section) to take first player.  There are a small amount of heavily out-of-balance cards, which are "balanced" by a small amount of "steal" cards that are way cheaper to use than the card they steal.

Still, the game plays fast, and uses a solid engine.  Could be good as a gateway game for adolescents.

I thought this game looked terrible.  Cheap components, board design is awful, not many permutations from game to game.  With that said, I still got a big kick out of playing the game.  Tableau builder with some neat synergy potential.  Definitely cheap components though.

Easy to jump into, but in the end Agricola without the tough decisions and optimization tactics. Way too long with five players (I could play again with three) and replayability a big question mark. In the end it would come down to managing to draw epics and large realms when you needed them. Big problem is the lack of really tough decisions though - critical for worker placement games.

Has the workings of an interesting game, but I'd say a few house rules required for this one (as they are for most KS).

Broken, boring, and completely fails at theme integration. The components feel cheap, the cards don't even fit properly in the chit tray, the in-game art is sparse and repetitive, and the use of space is not well executed (the size of all boards is ridiculously over-sized, especially considering how little information is conveyed). This is the first game we've bought where the box art and write-up actually made us feel deceived (and at $45, it stings).

Kickstarter backer. The boxes are super high quality. Cards a bit thin but good quality. Graphics on cards are good but generic by card type so somewhat dull. The bits are good quality, whether cardboard or wooden. Gameplay experience is worker placement and has some logic to it. Random events dont have enough umph to them to change gameplay much and make you sweat each turn of curse or blessing. Overall its a decent game for a quick grab off the shelf. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Agricola is the heavier game but it is also easier to play.  The theme of Upon a Fable is refreshing, the bits are top-notch, and the artwork is gorgeous.  Worker-placement enables cardplay and construction of a kingdom.  There are some oddball naming conventions (workers are fables?) but the real issue is a lack of flow.  There are 9 very different actions per turn across 9 turns and the result feels like 3 separate games.  Dense card text instead of iconography doesn't help.

I tried really hard to hate this game. I hated the theme, the art.. I tried trading it/selling it. 

But after looking it up, and seeing it was just a typical worker placement game, I thought I'd give it a try. 

Its a very easy to understand worker placement game. The theme gets lost over the mechanics (Which is great in my case). 

I enjoyed it quite a bit, plus the fact you can play solo is great!

RATING: 1
Non kickstarter version. Bits and boards are a little sub par. The cards feel nice. The tokens are thin. The insert I would be ok if the cards actually for in their slot. 

The gameplay is similar to agricola. My he exception being that it feels like no important decisions are being made. Feels like a pretty generic worker placement game. It is super simple to play, so that might be a plus for a gateway type game. Was thinking about getting the expansion but don't know if it's worth spending more money on this game. Most likely not.

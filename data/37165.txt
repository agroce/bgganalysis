RATING: 6
The rules ever-so-slowly creep towards improvement.  GW seems reluctant to ever start over fresh- its too bad they dodged the whole RPG "crash" that forced other properties (D&D, etc) to clean up their act and make a more mass-market approachable game...

More of the same, some changes to rules so that more models could be purchase. Felt the system has reached a point of peak and such changes just makes it head downhill.

Beautiful models as always.

40k gets a lot of flak for a lot of reasons (most of it deservedly) but it's a pretty fun game with more tactical play than many people are willing to admit.

The rules are pretty average but there's emergent gameplay and some fun metagaming. The models are cool and expensive.

One of the best 40K versions they've made, I think.  They've done a lot right this time, adding a little more complexity, but keeping it basic enough to be easily picked up and enjoyed.  If they'd get the army books all up to date, it would REALLY shine!

RATING: 7.2
Don't get me wrong; I loved (and still love) playing WH 40K... BUT, it really requires far too much in the way of time, rules/statistics retention, continuous upgrading of armies (i.e. money, time assembling, time painting...) for me to rate it as high as I would if I were just rating for fun factor.

It really is more a way of life than just a war game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The models and story rock, but this game is horrible.  First, you need a 1500 point army to play a 'normal' sized game, which requires WAY too many models. The game is not very strategic (a beer and pretzels game), but it takes a TON of time to play.  And finally, it's not balanced at ALL.  New stuff is always better, all the more to force you to buy new models.

Throwing 20+ dice at one time is fun, though.

Best not played as a game, but purchased just to assemble and paint some cool models.  Play Warmachine or Malifaux instead.

The new Black Reach set seems pretty good value and for a change gives you something like a complete starter army.

Great development for the most popular core game from Games Workshop. Plays much more intuitively than previous editions and the true line of sight rule draws you right into the action so that you can't help but get immersed in the drama of the batte.

A very good set of rules changes have made the game more dynamic. Overall it looks much better than 4th Edition, but a lot still rests in the hands of the Codex's to ensure the game stays in ballance. The return of the Dark Eldar will make some old players very happy. I should get my first plays of the new system this weekend but overall I'm quite excited by the changes (at least excited enough to head back to the painting table and studiously work on getting my Night Lords finished) and can't wait to sink my teeth into the game.

Used to play this a lot, but over time decided pricing was getting too much so sold my armies and invested in a decent collection of other games. 

GW needs to realize that price does matter and the cost for a competitive tournament army + rulebook needs to come down substantially.

RATING: 8
These rules are different enough to call it a completely new game - firing changes with the "true line of sight" rule - movement changes with the "Run" rule - it's a lot more fluid and will reward good tactics better than Fourth edition, I think. How the armies will change, is anyone's guess at this point!

Finally got to play 5th edition and I have to say this newest version of 40k has some serious problems.  

The terrain rules are a total mess and just invite arguments.  There was not a damn thing wrong with the 4th ed version. 

The assault rules give countercharge ability to every unit in the game.  So if you've played well and initiated assault half of the advantage of suprise is now gone as the assaulted foe can move all of the unengaged models 6" into the melee.

Vehicles are now terrible on the move and have reverted back to pillboxes thanks to defensive weapons being less than or equal to S4.  Not to mention they are extremely weak in assault vs S4 or better infantry.  (WTF you always srtike vs the rear armor?!!)

Sure I've only got 1 game under my belt but JFC!  Are they trying to ruin this game?!  These rules suck ass.

*update*  - I have a few more games under my belt and my initial suspicions about this ruleset have been borne out.  The terrain rules are tedious, slow and most of all, encourage tremendous jackassery.  In total 5th ed has some great elements but it's neutered by a handful of rules that make them rubbish. (Auto hit vehicles rear armor in melee, all units have the old countercharge, new wound allocation sys)  5th ed has caused me to box up my armies so that I can wait it out for 6th.  This edition deserves the 4 rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Played Rogue Trader, and decided to get back in with the new edition. Looks more squad-based than skirmish, which should help a bit, but it still has all the craziness-making scale issues. Haven't played yet, since I hate painting. (Oh, bad game choice, eh?) Most of the games I watch don't seem to have much maneuvering, either, which doesn't impress me. May well finish an army, just to use the figures with a generic set of rules.

Own three armies.  I will consider trading any of them:

a. Tyranids (1,500 pts)
b. Sisters of Battle/Witch Hunters (1,500 pts)
c. Imperial Guard - Tallarn (3,000 pts)

The rules are too simple for the most part and do not promote interesting tactical decisions.  Can still be fun, but no longer worth the investment for me (after having played for many years starting in 1997).

RATING: 7
To start off on a high note: Warhammer 40k is a great modeling hobby.  If you enjoy the absolute "zen" of sitting at a desk, planning, organizing, and painting models, then this game is truly a great way to do it.

The models are built extremely well to accept paint and are highly detailed.

The strategic elements of this game are great too.  There are literally hundreds of thousands of army combinations.  The game is complex enough that you can spend quite alot of time modeling the game and building your army.   That is a victory for strategy gamers in general since the potential game paths are potential countless.  Compare that to many games were you can only choose from MAYBE a dozen units.

Ok now the bad thing about this game; GREED.  Just like Magic the gathering, the price you pay for all these game paths is that it costs you an arm and a leg to buy all of the game units.  Building a "normal" sized army in 40k can potentially cost you between $250 to $1000 (or even more).  And you had better believe that even with the exact same number of "points" that a $1000 army will trounce a $250 army.  

So the game quickly degrades into a "arms race" between friends who seek out that perfect army composition and in turn build massive (and thus expensive) armies.  

Some people claim that this cost is justified.  But some armies are dirt cheap simply because they are not as popular, while other armies are extremely expensive.  That implies an attempt to make more money, instead of an attempt to cover costs, since all of the models of the same shape and size should cost relatively the same!

In short this is a great game in concept that is trashed by the "business" side of the house.  If you enjoy modeling and strategy gaming you can potentially have a great time with it.  On the other hand, if you and your friends cannot negotiate a "purchase" quota, you all are going to struggle to keep your bank accounts floating.

Let me just say that this isn't the best tactical game out there. That being said, when playing with fully painted armies on a table full of terrain, the experience can't be beat.  If you are just looking to play a game, look elsewhere, as this is a hobby.  Expect to spend a great deal of time painting and modeling.  For every hour of playtime, I probably have logged 3-4 painting and building terrain, tweaking army lists, etc...  This game has managed to keep my attention for 19 years.

This game is awesome, but it's also incredibly time consuming.  It requires you to collect miniatures outside of the rule book.  You have to build them and then paint them if you wish.  This, of course, all before you can even play the game.  Luckily I enjoy all this and fielding an army of well painted minis is really a sight to behold.  You field a full army against opponents in this game and then battle it out.  You can add whatever you want to this game to make missions or just go through an annihilation style battle.  Lots to do with this great game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Rating may or may not be influenced by my hate for GW as a company, or how recent edition changes killed tyranids (first combat resolution making gaunts a liability more than anything else, Then venom cannons being marginalized by the merged vehicle damage tables, then the 5th ed. tyranid codex that totally lost the plot). I've since traded my nids for more warmachine, but i still have a small space marine force that I'll probably never finish painting.

I LOVE the 40k universe. Augmented super soldiers in power armor, Space Marines. Corruption. Hulking space battleships. Fantasy races make endless war in deep dark space.
I love the videogames. Particularly Dawn of War II.
I love the miniatures.

Sadly, the actual tabletop game rules are really not great. Typical GW problems of imbalance and infusion of massive luck over any kind of truly interesting tactical decisions besides composing your army. Warmachine is sooooo much better (despite its imperfections). I'm against buckets of dice. Why don't we both just have a roll off, and save the setup time?

This is most peoples first foray into the world of tabletop wargames.  Although I have played 40K since around 1995 I've not managed to get as interested in the latest edition, probably due to the fact I feel the rules haven't been particularly well written and cause too many questions, particularly the true line of sight and cover rules which do not work well when you have a table covered in miniatures and scenery.  Still enjoy playing now and again but loathe ultra competitive gamers.

I'm a pretty big 40k fan.  Veteran of many Grand Tournaments, published in White Dwarf on many occasions, multiple Grand Tournament Best Army winner and multiple Golden Daemon winner.  This game has been a huge part of my life for over a decade now.  The game itself has had many ups and downs and rules changes since I started playing, but I've always loved the science-fiction and (mostly) visual aspect of this miniatures game.  This is a hobby, not a game.  My rating is based on my own personal enjoyment of this hobby and not my opinion of just the rules set or how I think others would like this game.

This score is based not only on the rules and playability of the game, but on the hobby as a whole.  The books, the painting, the worldwide community, and ultimately the fact that this is the ultimate beer and pretzels scifi wargame.  

Viewing this only as a game it would probably score one point less.  The fifth edition rules are the best iteration yet.  Is the game perfect?  Hell no, its got flaws everywhere, but the fifth edition really worked to fix some of the balance problems in the game.  Once they get all the codexes up to speed with 5th, it will be interesting to see how balanced the game is.

RATING: 4
Needlessly complicated ruleset, combined with a business model based on ripping off customers in a thousand different ways.

[q=HiveGod]8 --> 6  I'm at the point now where I'll actively avoid playing this... It's a fine-enough game, no doubt—it's just that I've had my fill.  I've pored over the books, painstakingly painted the armies, handcrafted the terrain, and played the hell out of it with innumerable memorable games, burning through four editions (2nd-5th).  In the end it feels like a middle school crush, a soft spot in my heart that is far superior in concept than actual execution.  It was only ever going to go so far, and it did, and so I am done.[/q]

As miniatures makers, very good. They have been the bests for a long time.

As a hobby, it's like a cult: every month they promise you a gaming paradise that never comes and little by little you lose all your money.

I know what I'm talking about. I had a 10,000 point Eldar army, I have been a W40K fanboi. No more. I have sold my minis and trashed the books. Avoid this game.

Best edition of the game before Games Workshop threw playtesting out the window. Still suffers from codex creep and some armies such as Tau and Dark Eldar did not see a codex for this edition, leaving them with equipment that became useless or inefficient due to dropping rules (such as morale tests to shoot farther targets) or simplification (all three vehicle damage tables consolidated into one with modifiers given the severity of the damaging shot).

Yes, it's expensive.  There's a lot of fun to be had and the minis look great though.  I enjoy the differences between the units and you can spend a lot of time in between games modeling, painting and customizing armies.

My 10 year old son can play with his friends.  There are a lot of rules to keep in mind, but most of them are pretty easy and captured on charts that you can download from the GW website.  A few of the more complex things that you need to play some armies (like the psyker rules and special weapons for Tyrannids), add some complexity but a lot of variety.

I'm interested in trading for Tyranids, Orks and Space Marines.

But as it is now the only way to find in toy store a key to the whole W40K world (I would rate 8/10), the rating will be 6 instead of 4 because (8+4)/2=6

Better buy only Black Reach if you collect both Orks and Marines.

RATING: 5
5th edition rules are 90% of the same rules Wh40K has always been - roll to hit, roll to wound, roll to save, remove models. Still a buckets-o'-dice fest that is loads of fun if not taken too seriously.  

This incarnation returns to the "virtual" tabletop where everything is precisely as it appears, (ie, that green felt with two trees on it is not a forest that you can't see through, it's just two trees). I can see the improvement in gameplay as it allows more emphasis on shooting. Under game designer  Cavatore's vision, (that's the same guy who saved Warhammer Fantasy), WH40K seems to be veering away from Uber armies towards a more WWII, troop focused game. And I approve very much! The scenario changes in 5th edition requiring Troop choices to hold victory conditions is a major step towards empowering regular troops. This can only lead to better tactics, and not the invulnerable juggernaut regiment plowing through the center of the board that the game had become. 

Great back-story, great models, and seeing two painted armies fighting it out over realistic terrain...just awesome!

2011: Hmm...back to Uber armies. These guys have no idea how to design a game.

Wow what a overly exhaustive combat system.  When you are rolling 40+ dice and get 2 actual hits something in the system is wrong.  Just a very cumbersome system.  Look to games like Warmachine and AT-43 (if you can get through the horrible translation of the rules) for much more streamlined systems.

I am a big fan of 40K, and have been for many years.

While the core system \ rules may be flawed, the game can still be fun.  I love the fluff \ background, the models, and even the rules (most of them).

I should mention that as of late (2010+), there has been a lot of codex creep, and the most recent armies (such as Grey Knights), seem a bit over-powered, especially in certain match-ups.  I am also getting a bit sick of all the special characters.

I should also point out that, especially as of late, I started to dislike GW's policies, and GW in general.  This is a tricky situation as I still like the game, just not so much the company that makes it.  That is why I never buy anything directly from GW, and I never attend any official tournaments.  Playing with friends at home \ private events is where it's at!

None the less, while it may be expensive, and time consuming, 40K can be very fun.  It's more than just a game, it's a hobby!

This game is win and lose before the game even starts. Veteran players can look at the army roster and give a 99.99% win/loss predication.
I may as well be playing Yahtzee if someone asks me to a game of 40K. I have over 8 armies each over 4k+ points in collection .. now they sit in the glass cabinet collecting dust.

After resisting the temptations of Games Workshop for the past thirteen years, I finally succumbed.  One month later: still painting but they're coming along.  I find myself purusing eBay for WH40K stuff and I spent $50 on the full-blown rulebook.  Now I'll need to dump a wad of cash on the Codex books for each army.  As the Talking Heads song goes: "My God, what have I done?"  UPDATE:  It's been three years since I painted. I really want to play WH but I prefer to use my free time to game, not paint.  Traded.

I like this ruleset a little better than 4th edition.  Everything seems more streamlined, even in the manual which is a major step-up from the confusing manual for 4th ed, where 90% of it was filled with fluff and background stories and the remaining 10% was disorganized and required you to memorize things like "Oh yeah, that rule's on paragraph 4 on page 93, but it's in the sidebar - but not the one all in itallics"

Just staring out with this one, so far I am really enjoying it.

7/18/2009 - playing my first tourney. Went 3-0, placed 2nd out of 20 people. A lot of luck involved, but still pretty awesome. I am enjoying the game a good bit, moving up to a 9.

10/11/2009 - played in my 2nd tourney at Rincom. Went 3-0 and got first. It was small (6 people). First tourney with my Tyranids that I started about a month ago now.

10/19/2009 - played in my first GT. Spent way too much time arguing rules with people. I don't think I'll do another GT.

4/19/2011 - sold my space marines, nothing left after selling tyranids a few months earlier

From time to time I love and hate this dangerous addiction. Not the best rules for a miniature game, but the one with the most interesting background and armies ever. 

This fifth edition could be definitely a great improvement over the past ones (towards a better and more tactical game), but as usual Games Workshop completely ruined a very good rulebook with insane rules on terrain pieces: now everyone can almost always shoot to everyone (even throught woods !?!) with just a 4+ save to the target.
Just use this rulebook with the terrain rules of the 4th edition and you have a good, fast and not-so-dumb game (ok, then there's the eternal issue with the balance of the codexes, but this is another problem ...)

The entire Warhammer series is a major dice-fest, which doesn't usually interest me but I had fun during my short time with Warhammer. All the different races and customization options are what caught my eye. The game clearly needs some balancing, but as I've been told it's pretty much an ever-changing system. It will stay on my radar for now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
 Well I don't prefer this edition over 4th but there is still one element of the game that I do not and will not agree upon and that is the movement rules. Individual races should have there own movement amounts rather then everyone moves 6". Although GW tried to compensate for this with Run, Fleet rules it still doesn't feel right to me that an Ork can move as quick as an Eldar or especially Tyranid creatures. I am sorry GW but you screwed up 40K for me after second edition when you messed up the movement phase. Other then that it's still a good skirmish Sci Fi game with excellent miniatures. After a few games I have come to the conclusion that this version is basically equal to the previous just elements of the rules have been sort of moved around. Some things are better that weren't so great before and other things have lost some effectiveness. I am still hoping that one day 40K will become like 2nd edition, the best, with a few tweeks, the ultimate sci fi miniature game.
The more I play this latest set of rules the more I dislike it, Alessio sucks.He ruined 40K for me.

Well maybe not ruined, I have to much invested in this game, 9 armies all 2,000 points plus and 90% painted. Although I don't always like when they change the rules but this time I look forward to another revision.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fun and engaging option to traditional boardgames or CCGs.  Crafting/modeling/painting the figures is just as fun, or even more fun, as playing.  The only real problem with the game is balance issues between the armies.  Some armies are just nowhere as powerful or effective as the others, and other armies, like Space Wolves and Imperial Guard, are arguably too powerful, no matter which army you compare them to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A Bloated set of rules that continue to suffer in the tradition of rolling large quantities of dice many times over.  Rules bogged down by a myriad of edge cases and situational vagary.

Improved many of the rules from 4th edition, then shot itself in the foot by adopting true LOS.  This may have something to do with the company's shift toward a "just have fun" mindset, which may be prompted by the fact that they can't write coherent unbreakable rules to save their own heads.  

Note that the true LOS is not necessarily bad, but definitely flawed in competitive play, where arguing can get you better cover and your opponent worse.

[i]The doom of the Eldar, when it came, took a form far more subtle and dangerous than civil war or alien invasion. The Eldar's pursuit of perfection in all things led them down the path of decadence until their society fell to a terrible sickness of the soul. 

Some heeded the portents that haunted their dreams. building great Craftworlds on which to flee to safety. Most glutted themselves on the pursuits of the depraved. Before long. brother fought brother and sadistic killers stalked the shadows. 

Amidst the swirling psychic energy of the Empyrean, the corruption of the Eldar became manifest. What an unimaginably foul and sickening being it was that the Eldar raised unknowingly in the Warp. No creature was ever birthed that was as terrible or perverse as the Chaos God Slaanesh, She Who Thirsts, the Doom of the Eldar incarnate. 

With a howl of raw power Slaanesh rose into supernatural life, and a psychic implosion tore at the universe. The epicentre lay within the gilded heart of the Eldar realms, leaving a pulsing afterbirth of raw Chaos in its place. Within the space of a single breath the Eldar had become a doomed people, knowing that their nemesis had been born and that it would hunt them for the rest of eternity.[/i]

The discussions over the changes between this and 4th edition led me to believe that I wasn't going to like the new rules.  But when I actually got around to reading the rules (and then playing), I discovered that nothing was as bad as I'd feared; and in fact I'm overall pretty pleased with the new rules.

I felt this edition worked well, without the munchkiness of later editions. It does advantage mobilised squad spam over deathballs, but I like the tactical interest that brings to the tabletop. The codexes are uneven in strength: IG being likely strongest, followed perhaps by Space Wolves. That isn't a tremendous problem for home games where it comes down to the models you have.

Second hand books and models off ebay would be a cheap way to get into 5th edition 40k.

I spent quite some time on this hobby. I like paining miniatures and creating custom stuff like terrain. Also planning out your army is something I often really enjoyed.

Playing the actual game takes some effort. You need quite some table (or floorspace in my case) space in order to play it. Also moving your army to where you are going to play a game is not a trivial task, and can result in damage.

Having you own painted army take the battle field has a very great visual appeal to me. The tactical play of the game is also an aspect I really like.

The is only thing though that makes the hobby a bit prohibitive, besides the space requirements. And that's the price point. This is a very expensive hobby! 1 transport costs about the same a new brand new boardgame! An army starterset even more so, and even then you still have a weak army, not even close to playable if you take the 1500 point army limit. And there are the paints that cost the same as a Magic the Gathering booster pack!

But if you have the disposable cash, or intend to keep it as your only hobby, that the cost factor might not be too much of a problem. And otherwise there are always people who quit the hobby and are selling their army on Ebay. Which might save you doing a paintjob, if that's not your thing.

I feel this version is slightly better then 4th edition. The 5th edition codexes are great though, but the 5th edition ruleset was not worth buying a new book for.

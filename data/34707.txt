After one play (with 3) I liked it.  Plays quickly if each player doesn't spend too much time looking for the perfect play.  I'm ready to play this game several times and want to play it 2 player.

RATING: 6
"Tile-laying" (except you use cards in a fairly unique way) and set collection.

I've only played this 2-player, and it looks like that's the best number.  My wife likes it, so it gets played once in awhile.  The unique use of cards (they are laid and layered similar to tiles) makes the game.  Really it's a fairly pedestrian game, but it gets some table time again because the wife likes it.

Play cards and match colors! Weeeee! It feels just like I'm really building the Hanging Gardens, in the same way that getting punched in the gut feels just like brushing my teeth while watching a movie!

While this game is good for its interesting play style and mechanics (I'm not sure what to compare it to), this is another game where it functions at best with 2 people. From having to take 2 cards per turn (back and forth between players) and having to balance when to score a 3-square garden for less point-tile options (and not necessarily to get that tile but to expose more tiles to increase possible options) and when to wait to score a 6-square! (Extra tile!)

Wife and I really enjoy this game.

Colourful, well produced. Is both game and puzzle. Plays fast and is fun.

We have played many games, 2p, 3p and 4p and works equally well, partly because of the puzzle aspect of creating your gameboard. 

Not exciting, but a really pleasant and rewarding time. It has definitely found a place in our home.

RATING: 6
A nice game. After all those brutal games it's refreshing to play a constructive game in which you do not destroy other players' play but only deny them their most wanted cards. I enjoyed Hanging Gardens thoroughly. Not deep enough to get a higher rating though.

You cannot really have a strategy because your actions have little impact on the long term play. You just do what's best at the time and that's it. Any longer perspective thoughts are only speculation on the odds. This is a pure tactical game.

RATING: 6
An interesting play with a puzzle element that might throw off some players.  Working with one resource (cards) to get another is a common mechanic, but I felt my turn was irrelevant if I was the last player.  The choices when in last place were very limited.  (This was a 3 player game)

The game was fine, but I could see a frustration level growing over more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The spatial puzzle element of laying overlapping cards to form groups of four types of landscape, I found surprisingly engaging (I'm not a great puzzler).  The set collection element of the game seems a little too dependent on the luck of the draw and of timing.   

The artwork is rather bland; you wouldn't believe these gardens were one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.  Production quality is decent.

This game is so beautiful to look at that I want to take it out to a fine restaurant so other men will envy me.

(A little added note here: Play this game on a big enough space that you will *never* have to move your cards once they've been played. It is not a pretty thing when this happens)

This one was hard to get a hold of but well worth it. 
Essentially a tile laying / set collection game, the Hanging Gardens plays as easily as any other of that type and looks good on the table doing it. each round you will select cards to place in your tableau to try and make matches of certain types of terrain. But the cards must be laid out in such ways that spaces only overlap if there is a spot on an underlying card. So you have to place the cards very strategically especially since you want the same terrains to be side by side in certain numbers so that you can place temples on them in order to collect point tiles. The more tiles of one type of terrain you can collect the more points you will receive at the end of the game.

Very playable and unoffensive game with set collection and puzzle elements.  I'm really at a loss to say much more than that, heh.  For my tastes it kinda falls in the Zooloretto zone of being able to play any time, but probably never asking to do so. Time has not been kind to the design.

Got it for my wife for Christmas.  It's not terribly complicated, and it's a pretty game to look at.  The scoring seems to confuse people.  The garden building is unique, and I enjoy the puzzle aspect of the game.  It works very well as a two player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fairly standard set-collection game with two twists, one little and one big. The big twist is what makes the game, the sub-game of arranging the cards in your garden properly. Sometimes requires a lot of tablespace.

Eventually traded away when it became apparent that there would always be more interesting stuff to bring to the table.

RATING: 6
There are some interesting mechanics in this game with the overlapping cards.  Due to them sliding around, the game will end up feeling fiddly, but card alignment aside, the rest of the game play is quite pleasant.  Remember that this is a light filler and can be played by 2, 3 or 4 equally well and you'll find it a nice home when you are looking for that something different at the end of a game night.  Its fairly easy to teach and game length is about right for its weight.

Interesting 30 minute game. I especially like the puzzle mechanic where big groups can come flying at you if you plan your lay-out well. The scoring mechanism is great too. The only thing I don't like is the 5-point rule per missing tile in the end. If this problem would have been solved a little bit more beautiful, I would have given it an 8.

Both parts of the game - "tile"-laying and set collection - were interesting in and of themselves. Unfortunately, they were almost entirely disconnected from one another.

The tile-laying isn't informed by anything regarding the set collection, except that you time your builds to correspond with tiles you desire.

This game is an excellent combination of tile-laying and strategic scoring.  I really enjoy the way that you can build your garden in clever ways so that you can re-use spaces.  And I always enjoy games that have that scoring mechanism where one pieces' value is variable based on the number of pieces of that type (or other types) you grab.  An all-around fun game that is easy to teach to new gamers.  It gets even more strategic and nasty with 2 players because you can afford to take a card that doesn't help you in order to slow down your opponent.  I have noticed some analysis-paralysis in selecting the cards, so be warned!

RATING: 6
Enjoyable, but not remarkable in any way. In hindsight, there wasn't really any need for me to buy this, since I already had Alhambra and Maori and they fill pretty much the same niche. This game did not click with my wife either, so I have a feeling it will end up on the trade table soon. One play, three players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
Somewhere between a long filler and a short main game - sort of Alhambra territory. Has plenty of difficult decisions and rewards clever play, whilst still dishing up enough luck of the draw to avoid runaway leaders.

Probably the best thing about it is the way you have to play the cards you are given - you really have to balance points and position. Probably the worst thing is the preponderance of luck (would have liked a little less) and the colour choices - the yellows, whites and oranges were far too close for play in subdued lighting.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
I am pretty picky with tile placement games (not one of my favorite mechanisms).  This one was ok, but would be interested in trying it again.  You can definitely get screwed over by the card / tile draws, since you have zero idea what is coming next, but its still fun to try to set up combos you hope you can hit.  Definitely does not outstay its welcome, and I am pretty sure this one could get down to about 20-30min (Took us around 50min with rules).  The legal placement of the cards is a little tough to explain, but kind of makes sense once you get going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice medium light game. The card laying aspect is really the whole game, but is neat enough. The vp tiles add a small extra layer onto the decision making, and a bit of luck as well.

Only ever played with two players, but played it a tonne and grew to love it. Three should be great too. I wouldn't want to even try it with four, though.

RATING: 7.5
A nice game.  I enjoy the puzzle like aspect of trying to get three or more in a row to score and trying to set yourself up for a bigger set to get that specific tile you want.  Watching what someone else is doing is also helpful as you don't want them to take something you have your eye on or have them get six or more grouped together and get that extra tile (that you don't know what it is). I can see this going up with more plays.

I have a thing for tile laying games and this is no exception. Unique use of the mechanic and a fun puzzle. Plus I like how much interaction there is in taking cards and tiles along with building your own garden
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The card "layover" mechanic is refreshing compared to many recent games.  Building a versatile play area with the cards is quite challenging, especially since you have to be careful that you don't screw it up by placing the little wooden temples in bad locations.  Sure, it's mostly a set collection game, but there is a good puzzle element too... and plenty of interaction between players through tile poaching and card choices.  

The luck of the draw might cause me to drop the rating after additional plays (some say that the game comes down to luck of the draw at the end).  Also, the limitations on building make it feel like the game is playing you to a certain extent.

RATING: 7
This is a fun game that I'd rate higher if it had more options.  The problem is that there seems to be one very efficient way to play this game that is tough to beat, which forces you to attempt to do it each game.  Thus, imo this becomes a game not of strategy but of implementation of a fixed strategy.

This game is nothing profound, and to be honest with 2 I find the set collection aspect a bit too wide open - the game will run long enough that you'll likely be able to finish most sets you start, which reduces the tension somewhat.  Ashar really likes spatial puzzles as a mechanic, and I guessed correctly she'd like this one because of that factor.  Not my favorite game by any means, but one I probably underrated in the past.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very unusual game with a unique card-laying mechanic that seems to have been recycled by Patchistory. Laying cards for your garden is very tricky, especially at the beginning of the game when space is so limited. For similar reasons, choosing where to place your temples can also be hard, as you won't get them back for a while and they can seriously be a pain if they're in your way. A great part of the game's strategy, then, is spatial: how do plan your garden to benefit you over the long term? If you plan well, towards the end of the game you should have a little "garden engine" going, where you can place a card, move a temple, and thus free another area of your garden for the next turn. It's quite an ingenious little game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like it.  It's quick, has novel mechanics, and is a lot of fun.

Unfortunately, it has a turn order issue with 4p that could have easily been fixed by adding four more cards.  This is an awful oversight, and has caused me to drop it to a 7.

RATING: 4
It's OK.  Too much randomness in what ends up being a fairly thoughtful / cerebral game.  You can do your best to position yourself to use a wide variety of cards, but in the end it won't help if someone else keeps getting the "3 of a kind" cards (which are just plain more valuable than the other cards) or gets tiles he can use from the blind draw (for completing a 6+ section) while you draw squat.  I'll play it if somebody else wants to, but I don't like it enough to keep my copy.

A unique sort of game; one player called it Mah-jong in reverse.  Construct groupings of development using cards, in order to receive tiles towards producing point sets. Better than I'd expected.

RATING: 4
Eh, this one is pretty take it or leave it to me.  There's a lot of randomness here, from what cards you get to what rewards are available to you when you score, but it's forgivable for such a short game.  Nevertheless, it's pretty dumb that your score is all based on how lucky you were to have the correct tiles available when you were able to score.  While the game isn't completely offensive, there's lots of other filler material out that I'd rather play.

The similarities to Alhambra are unavoidable, and this game seems to scratch the same itch as that one.  I think what holds this game back from being a top 100 game is that it is a 2-player game as written.  3 is ok, 4 would be horrific.  This is because there is a lack of balance in the cards that are available each round.  The 2-player game though is alot of fun and I would recommend it to others in that capacity.

Okay game, but felt like other games had done each part better. I liked the overlaying card building aspect, but the point tiles just seem to overlay a little bit artificially.

RATING: 6
Hanging Gardens is a spatial game where players draft cards with different coloured squares on them and try to create chains of similar colours which can then be cashed in for victory point chips off the display. After scoring a chain, a wooden temple is placed on that grouping, and prevents it from being scored again...that is, until the temple is cut off from the group by further card play and a new group is formed. The victory point chips are based on progressive payouts: some are rarer, and only score one of two different things (i.e.: Y-Z) others are more common, and have a larger range of payouts (W-X-Y-Z). The idea is to collect as many of these complete sets as possible, as the scoring is much better when you collect a full 2, 3, 4 of a given set.

The game in certain ways reminds me of a the spatial thinking that games like Java require, which makes me like it. It does have some heavy randomness in terms of the available cards and the victory point tiles, both of which are obviously rather important. For a short, filler type game it's not bad at all though, and I like the kind of thinking it requires, even as I'm aware of the fact that what one has to work with, and how much one can score for that work is often at the whim of the capricious fates.

The puzzle aspect really appeals to me as do the decisions that have to be made regarding which VP tile to choose.  The game feels very different if the sculptor, gardener, etc... come out early in the game vs. late in the game.  Early rating of 9 - may fluctuate slightly with more plays.

Not bad. The thing about cards laying on top of each other feels a bit like RatHot (overlaying them trying to create connected groups of symbols). The set collection like Alhambra. I'd rather play point tiles face up, though, as I find remembering what people took possible but an unpleasant chore. I also think tiles should slide down rather than be replaced in place, giving more chance for new tiles to last a bit longer.

Two player game sucks eggs.  The set collection aspect of the game works poorly with two players, because taking tiles that don't complete sets is just about as good for you as ones that do---generally you're stopping your opponent from completing a set.

Three players is sort of ok although not really that interesting.  Four, I suspect, is worse again.  Could play once in a while with 3 if in the right mood.

Yup, I really like this one. Have only played 2 players but have enjoyed it a lot. Can't wait to play with more people.

The card and the scoring mechanics are intriguing. Don't have anything like it in my small collection, so I'm very happy with the purchase.

This is one under rated game.

EDIT: Have played with 3 and 4 now - still love it!

EDIT 2: I have played quite a few games with 2 players, and I think that's the best for this game. I'm enjoying it more and more. I even got a friend hooked and let it to him for the Christmas holidays!

I normally don't mind a thinly themed abstract, but in this case, the theme actually seems to get in the way of the gameplay.  Really all it consists of is building sets of colours on the playing field, in order to collect sets of colours from the scoring table. The sets of colours on the playing field and the sets of colours on the scoring table each have names, but the names are irrelevant, and harder to remember than the colours.  The 2 different sets of colours have no connection to each other, it's just 2 different mechanics tied together arbitrarily.  There aren't any major problems with the game, the theme and mechanics just didn't seem coherent enough for me to really get into it.  It's still enjoyable to play though, and my partner appreciates the puzzle aspect and the non-conflict.

Update: traded away.

Light, quick, simple, luck-filled, painless.   Not a whole ton to get excited about, but not much to complain about either.   It is a set-collection game where you buy your tile sets via building chains of icons on overlapping cards.  Quite puzzly, if you like that sort of thing. I'm not sure that it will have a very long shelf life, but the speed and simplicity of it could result in quite a few plays.

While aesthetically pleasing this didn't rock my boat - probably less a gamer's game than a good game for families, so the rating might be very different if you play it with your aunt who likes gardening.

A cute little game that isn't really tile laying so much as spatial reasoning coupled with set collection (the tiles).  Be aware there is a pretty big dash of randomness thrown in with how both the tiles and the cards come out.

This game is reminiscent of Alhambra in how it scales, with increasing chaos as the number of players increases.  With two players (my preferred number), one has a degree of choice of the tiles and cards that come out, giving at least some hope of pusuing a strategy.  With three and especially with four, these choices become more uncertain.  Like Alhambra, it can be very frustrating with this number of players as one watches the tiles and cards that one needs get taken off the board before your turn, all the while hoping something good comes out or is left for you. 

All in all, Hanging Gardens is a quick and enjoyable offering that plays quite well with two.

Thought the wife would like this because it had an "arranging your house" element like Alhambra. Unfortunately, the game moves at a glacial pace and it's just not very compelling. Another hitch is that tile availability is a complete crapshoot since there's no guarantee that you will see matching rare tiles, and this gets worse as the number of players goes down. Even in a 4 player game we probably only used half of the tiles.

Easy rules, different mechanics, graphics nice, short game, and some strategy too. You create your game board as you play, and every game is different.

RATING: 8
This is an interesting cardgame. Its tension is created between enlarging your playing area (in the early game), scoring immediately, and setting up bigger scores for the following turns. The tiles induce a bit of randomness, which, though rarely, can decide the game.

Players lay down cards with motifs trying to make groups of 3-or-more of the same motif. When they do, they can choose one of the scoring tiles available. The scoring tiles give you different amounts of points based on how many of that kind you already have (ex: the Gate, 0-5-10-25, gives you 0 points if you have one, 5 if you have two, and so on; the Queen, 1-15, gives you 1 if you have one and 15 if you have 2). At any moment there are 6 scoring tiles available, 2 for groups of 3 (or more) of the same motif, 2 for groups of 4 (or more) and 2 for groups of 5 (or more). Scoring a group of more than 5 lets you draw one of the 6 tiles as usual, plus a random tile. When a scoring tile is taken, it is replaced by a new randomly chosen one.
Sometimes no one of the six tiles will be interesting for a player, so it would be nice to have the option to draw (and reveal) a random tile instead of one of the 6 available. But this is just a nitpick.

The game seems brilliant and rewards skillful play. Choosing which card to draw, where to place it, and when to score isn't trivial at all.

There are some interesting ideas in Hanging Gardens, especially the way new cards get placed to extend your building area and how scoring temples hurts your ability to build other combos. These are, however, mostly overshadowed by a fairly bland set collection mechanism that makes people try not to compete with each other and overly favours those sitting at the right place in turn order at the right time.

A wonderful game that provides unique mechanics and challenges the brain spatially.  Although this is truly a multi-player puzzle, I do feel the choices made either offensively or defensively have real impact on all players.  The game appears to get more chaotic with three or four, and more strategic with two as the players have more choices.  All in all a fresh design, that incorporates drafting as well as a tetris-like puzzle element, and set collection.  This is a game that creates a new niche for me, and I could see it rising to a favorite amongst two player offerings.

UPDATE: I love the relaxed, meditative gameplay here.  There are real decisions, but it never over extends the brain cells.  Play time is quick, and it is a peaceful, contemplative little design. Up to a nine.

Run away alert: this is reheated gruel.

I played it again and no, it is not any better with 3 players.  The rating drops to 2 - "annoying, won't play it again".

I tried to "fix" it after the first game by separating, shuffling and dealing the 6 or 7 special chits, one to each player before the game began. This had the effect of giving each player a "secret mission" and it did somewhat improve the game and the luck of the draw problem. However, luck of the draw was not the only problem...


-------------

My one-phrase description of this is: "Inferior Alhambra knock-off".  Rated it a 4.  Perhaps once or twice a game you are presented with an non-obvious choice - that's just not frequent enough.

Played once with four players, it might be better with 2 or 3.

The multiple luck elements: card flip and tile draw were more restrictive and limiting than Alhambra and therefore create more luck-of-the-draw... also not a good thing.

Neat mechanic for earning the tiles.  My only criticism is the sets vary wildly in value and availability, based on the luck of the draw.  You have no chance of knowing what will net you points.

Clever expanding of the mechanisms seen in Rat Hot, this plays well, has a nice theme, and about the right luck level to prevent over-thinking - no point analysing to death as the next tile will be different anyway, though as you get better at it you can start seeing which cards would be ideal for the others.

Plays kind of like Flower Power crossed with Alhambra crossed with Taluva.  But better.  Steer clear if capricious luck of the draw bothers you.  I enjoy the miniature tactical puzzles the game presents, trying to figure out how to score regions while setting up for future opportunities.  But there's no way to look ahead to future landscape cards, so planning ahead is a matter of playing the probabilities and keeping your options open.

Definitely plays best with just two players.

Feels janky, as if the whole game started as a set-collection drafting game, but it was mediocre and so the entire tile-laying puzzle was grafted on to explain why you can't always just take the tile you want.

This is not the game that I was expecting.  It made me think of Alhambra at first, but it's actually more similar to Rat Hot, Taluva, or Java in the card placement.

RATING: 6
A nice combination of a placement puzzle and set collection. Players choose and place cards in ways that allow them to grow gardens. Once the gardens reach a certain size, they can be scored which allows you to grab a tile that is worth points at the end of the game. Sets of like tiles are more valuable.

There is some frustration when the player ahead of you grabs the card that would be perfect (or you are stuck with a card that is terrbile), but the decisions are pretty light. Fortunately, the game plays quickly and is fun for that length.

Enjoyable little game with a fairly original card placement mechanic and not so original set collection scoring. I like the spatial puzzle, but it's a shame that luck plays a huge part. Some cards are clearly better than others, and which scoring tiles are available to you are completely random, not to mention a gambling element on whether you will be able to complete sets. It's also one of those games where the only player interaction is to take things that others want, but most of the time you do it unintentionally. In my only game, in the last turn, a tile that was worth 1 point for another player and 23 points for me was taken by him, just because the only other tile he could take was worth zero. I still won, but I had to work harder to get a 14-point tile. Since the scoring tiles are random, there is very little incentive to make larger groups of garden motives, and it seems the best strategy is to get as many tiles as you can.

My favourite thing about this game so far is the slow realization that always going for that extra bonus tile does not necessarily equate a better score. In fact with repeated play  find that as people start to take tiles they need as soon as they can, rather than wait to get six motifs, the aggregate score of of all the players combined is creeping up.

Better than a kick in the teeth, but there isn't enough game here. The decisions don't seem all that interesting, and the game has failing for voth 2 and 4 players. With two there's little tension. With four, many times your decisions are entirely obvious.

This game is probably better with 3 players than with the 4 I played with.  Don't sit in the 4th seat if you play with 4.

The game play is interesting, and set collection is fine.  But in the end, I'd much rather play a game like taluva which reminds me of this, but is more fun.

UPDATE: The luck on this drives me insane.  I'd really rather not play it.

I like having tiles refill where they were taken from in the display.
My SO likes having the tiles slide down when they refill.

This difference has sadly led to an impasse where the game doesn't get played very much. (very unfortunately/silly because it is such a lovely game!)

RATING: 5
Well, it's certainly pretty.  It reminded me of Taluva in that you want to lay one card over a set of symbols to separate them, but it is much more random and I also found it more frustrating, because you often must destroy something to your detriment and it is very difficult to set up for potential future moves.

First played June 26th, 2008. Taught in 5min, played in 30min with 2 players. It has a good mixture of luck and strategy. I'd recommend giving this a try, especially if you can manage to play with someone's copy. There are tiles with various VPs on them. Some are climbing sets with 1, 5, 10 pts if you have 1, 2, and 3 of them. Others (single tile for each set) work with sets in that if you get a complete set (max pts for a set type) you get get a certain VP value. Each tile has the number of like tiles in the upper right hand corner along with the set values at the bottom. There is also a deck of cards with 6 areas on them. Some area's have pictures while other has blank spots. Each player starts out with a card that has 6 empty spots on it. The object is to get sets of 3 or more pictures orthoganal to each other. Once you do, you may "score it" and place one of your 5 temples on one of the pictures. When you score, you take a tile and replace it with the hidden general supply. You may score later as well, however only after you add at least one picture to it and it isn't connected to a picture that has a temple on it. Once you run out of temples, you use the temple with the least amount of pictures connected(ties you choose). The board is filled with 6 tiles and 4 cards. On your turn you take a card and place it on your start card such that the pictures alway have to go over a space that is already within your garden, however the blank spots may be placed anywhere. A card also may not be placed on top of a temple. When scoring, you can take any of the 6 tiles if you have 5+ pictures, if you have 4, you can only take from the 4 three or four tile spaces and if you have 3 you can only take from the two 2 spaces. Game ends when you run through the deck. Flip the board over to count up the VPs; winner is the one with the most.

Aug08: Finally got to try this game. Not bad, not bad at all. The only complaint might be just how simple it is. It's a one-trick-pony, but that one trick is a mighty cool one. Trying to layer your cards over each other is quite enjoyable. Collecting the score chits is about as boring as mud however. I wish there was something more interesting on the back end.

Still, I might pick this one up eventually just as a very good spatial reasoning game.

Only 1 play so far, but really impressed with this game.  Really great theme with beautiful, colourful tiles and cards.

The idea of the game is to create groups of groups of the four different types of garden on your play area, using cards with different combinations of the gardens depicted on them.  The mechanic is made all the more interesting by the temples which are used to score the groups potentially blocking the way for you to get more groups, so there is some deeper strategy here.

When you score a group of gardens your reward is a choice of available tiles, which form a separate set-collection mechanic which is nicely done, and includes unique 'bonus' tiles for each set for extra variability.

Would like a few more games, but after only one play I think I can recommend this quick and colourful game.

Really neat little game, although I can see why it's not more popular. I know my wife wouldn't like the spatial element, and it has the potential to feel frustrating when the cards and/or scoring tiles aren't going your way. But it's light and quick and rather different from most games.

Hanging Gardens is an original addition to the tile-laying genre. To be exact, it is a card-laying game. The configuration of the cards, rules for laying them down and decisions over when and where to place temples add up to the novel and interesting core of the game. The scoring based on set collection is more run-of-the-mill and adds an element of chance to the outcome. Hanging Gardens works quite well with 3 or 4 players, but it is best as a 2-player game.

RATING: 6
Great job on a first design, nice 30-40 minute filler that has enough meat to keep you interested (on par with Taluva almost in time and meat).  

Push your luck, set collection, screwage, and interesting scoring, best with 3, 4 fine just a bit longer not sure about 2, should work fine really just tiles easier to get, maybe less come out not sure if rule was scaled.  

Seems turn order and when scoring tiles pop up have a little too much bearing on final scores.

Freshness will most likely wear off fast

I'm not one for abstracts, but this game caught me a little off guard.  There's a fair bit of thinking going on in how to place your cards to maximise point tile choices and it all seems to fit.  The rules are simple and the theme is fairly tacked on, but a 4-player game clocks in at about 45 minutes, so if you take a loss... you have time for another.

I love the simplicity of the rules, heavy tiles and cards, and the game board (backprinted with a scoreboard for end of game scoring) is well laid out.

A word to those who play for the first time.  If someone can manage to get a 5/5 area set up with all of his temples built, beware of a back and forth point grab of two tiles per turn by building 6-6-7-7..

After only a couple of plays, I like Hanging Gardens a lot.

An inventive game that uses a central mechanic that was picked up and adapted to the civilization game genre in Patchistory. I played Patchistory first, and not too long ago, so the predecessor relationship of Hanging Gardens is very clear. 

Each turn you add a card to your tableau, "patching" them so that buildings are placed over empty building spaces. Buildings come in 4 types and from one to three of these are scattered in various patters on cards which are divided into six parts. When you create of set of a building type consisting of a contiguous set of 3 or more buildings you can place a marker on it to use it to draft a scoring tile. The larger your set of buildings, the more tile drafting options you have. Tiles score at the end of the game in standard escalations by set type and amount.

All in all, a light, pleasant game for fans of spacial puzzles. Plays well with two, less well with three, and even less well with four.

Trying to efficiently put your garden together is a lot of fun. Laying cards on top of each other, forming and destroying groups of motives, and placing temples are all interesting decisions and as an exercise in spacial geometry the game is beautiful and exciting.

However you don't score points directly from having a great garden put together, you have to do some set collection first. So when you form a group, and what size group you want to form might depend on which tiles are available and which tiles you possess. There's nothing special about this part of the game, it's set collection like you've seen it a million other times. It does tend to make the games very close, and with the amount of luck in the game I don't think you're going to win this game more than 1/N (1 in 4 with four players, etc...). 

At around 30 minutes this is a great filler, and the novel garden construction mechanic is great fun and as far as I'm concerned it makes the game. It's loads of fun to build your garden, and I guess at the end someone wins but I don't really care about that part of the game :)

I've played with 4 3 and 2 and I have to say it's much better at 3 and 2 than at 4, I prefer 3. Be sure to remove the right number of cards so that everyone is start player the same number of times (important for 3 and 4 player games). The benefit of going first should really be spread out evenly.

Another one of the lighter HiG games which I consider to be amongst the best published games today (e.g. Thurn & Taxis, Oregon, Finca). This tile-laying game feels like solving a puzzle. There is some indirect interaction by taking the tiles needed by others. Luck can play a big part if the right tiles show up only at the wrong time. Of the above named games, Hanging Gardens ranks close behind Oregon and Thurn & Taxis which are both among my absolute favourites but clearly ahead of Finca. One caveat: this should be played with two or maximum three players. Otherwise the tile draw will decide too much.

Played with 4 players and there was significant downtime between turns. Also a very tactical game 4-player. I believe that 2-player would run more smoothly and with more strategy.

RATING: 6
Rating based on 1 play with 4 people (with one glacially slow player who definitely did not improve our playing experience).  Would be willing to play again, but it didn't strike my fancy.  Obvious learning curve in terms of how to set yourself up for scoring -- the high score in our game was 34, but I'm not all that excited about spending time to figure out the best tile laying strategies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I was surprised to enjoy this one as much as I did, since I'm not one for tile laying games.  But this one is clever and relatively quick.  It should be noted that as downtime grows, my enjoyment of this game would go down quickly.  But played at a good pace, this is good clean fun, though certainly not very original.

After a few games, it seems like a good thing to get a bunch of 4 space groups and just keep churning through them, moving your temples back and forth - very powerful.

Got it because of the beautiful art. Thought it would be a nice game about building up plants, but it's really more like Blockus. You have cards in your hand and you wish you could play them, but you're restricted by the Tetris-like placement rules. [thing=40628][/thing] is a plant-themed game that's better for being more relaxed; [thing=128271][/thing] is a plant-themed game that's better if you want to build something pretty.

What a surprising  game.  Played with my 8 year old daughter and she crushed me.  Didn’t really like it the first 10 minutes...then I started seeing the cleverness of it.  It’s much deeper I think than it appears at first glance.  Curious to see what strategies emerge following more plays.  Not sure it will stay in the collection though as it’s commanding a decent price right now.

This is an older and lesser-known Hans im Glück game that I bought used very cheap because I was curious. While it’s another old-fashioned Eurogame where you collect tiles with a special mechanism in order to have various set collection scorings in the end, the way you build your gardens is rather special (well, at least I haven’t really seen it before). And it has a nice dynamic throughout the game, a kind of story arc if you will: the first few cards are just about setting up the area, while in the last few rounds you keep scoring with practically each card (having more control on the events). It’s intriguing (while it has a wife-friendly theme); I do want to play it at least a few more times to explore the possibilities.

It's rather abstract so it will appeal to some and not others.  It is a card-layover (other cards) type of game where you are making choices to align certain squares with empty or occupied ones.  This is a tactical bidding mechanism for you to acquire garden (victory) tiles.  Your goal is to acquire tile sets that compound your final score by accumulating as many of the same types as possible.  Simple and fast with good choices.

I really enjoyed this mix of tile game and puzzling out how best to build your gardens to create and develop sets of tiles.  Very straightforward to play, the first play will be full of moments where you want to slap yourself for stupid placement of temples to claim sets, etc.  There is a significant luck of the draw aspect that occurs in this game, but if you can past that, there is a fun game from my perspective here.  As well, it can be played in about 20 minutes once you know what's going on!  Do NOT play with four - the best way to play is with two or three.  Four barely gives you a chance to do anything before the game is over.

It feels like the game is too short, with not enough opportunity to collect the valuable scoring tiles - the game feels chaotic rather than tense, and a lucky or unlucky card draw in the early game can make or break a player. Still, it's probably worth trying as a 2-player game.

RATING: 6
simple collection game that looks great. The bigger your collection of a certain kind of flowers, the more points. The building cards give you constraints to what you can collect and what not.
The luck factor is a bit too high to make it a great game. Playing this with 2 players, makes you feel you are missing something,... more players :-)

Minus: 2 - 3 (replayability) - 6 - 10

RATING: 7
Charming puzzle game with as much or little interaction as set collection games tend to have. Judging from my second game, there might be a small problem with starting order, since having to pick up a card that forces you to completely cover your initial four building squares might set you back noticably.
Played thrice.

I did not expect to like this game as much as I do.  To me, at least, it is unique and fun.  There is an element of luck to it, but the timing of your placements and the design of your garden all contribute to your final score.  It's well-made and easy to play, just as simple to teach.  Best as a 2 player, I believe.  It is also one of the few games in my collection that my wife actually likes and suggests on occasion.

Very tetris-y--arrange cards to create groups of adjacent symbols while being careful not to cover others.  Groups allow you to draw tiles, groups of tiles are worth more, so it's also a bit of set-collection.  I like this one a lot--pretty game, simple concept, quick to play, somewhat thinky without any real chance of AP--only a few cards to choose from on any given turn, only a few ways to place them.

[01/14/2008] 2 4-player games. A lot of luck in the timing of draws of cards & tiles, as well as blind draws, and tiles that don't get into play, makes this mostly a game of luck. Neat card placement mechanism let down by the rest of the game around it. About the only good thing that can be said is that it plays quickly. If it wasn't for my wife (very much a non-gamer) liking it my pre-order copy would hit the trade pile without even being opened. [07/06/2008] Played 2-play and it's a decent game. A bit like Carc really, shines as a 2-player game, as you have more control and can plan your moves more.

RATING: 6
A game where you form sets in order to collect sets in order to get points. The first part (forming sets) is actually pretty interesting and challenging. The second part (collecting sets Bohnanza style) is a annoyingly chaotic. The swing of points between getting the tile you need to finish a set and not getting it is huge, and your control over getting it is small. Still, not a bad game given the interesting tetris like challenge of it and the quick playing time.

I found this to be a very enjoyable placement game.  From a play standpoint it's a step above vanilla Carcasonne and below Alhambra.  It's a drafting game where the icons on the cards you choose must all be touching paper (other cards).  Players are then trying to create sets of 3-6 icons in order to earn VP cards.  The key to the game is drafting cards that allow you to expand your gardens and provide scoring flexibility.  Sometimes it's worthwhile to give up a scoring opportunity to set yourself up for more scoring later.  Also there's an interesting mechanic with temples that are placed on the board when you score and work as blockers, in a sense.  However, once you score 5 times you then remove your temple that contains the least amount of icons attached to it... with careful planning you may be able to score these areas again soon. 05-2008

UPDATE: After having a few more plays under my belt I'm lowering the rating 1 point. The cards can be frustrating. Still a solid tactical game. 03-15-2013

Colorful game of psuedo-tile placement (cards instead of tiles, but cards divided into tile-like elements) to gain a garden of one 'type' with a large size.  Trade in large gardens to get victory point chits, and collect sets of these VPs to increase their value.  Nice relatively light game, and the mechanics blend well together after a couple plays.  A bit limited player interaction -- you're grabbing cards (tiles) away from others, and grabbing VPs in order to make sets, so being aware of other players' board space is very useful.

Loved the spatial puzzle here, though it's possible to get screwed by the card draws. Still, even clever play cannot control the prizes awarded so the scoring really falls down here.

I will try again at 2p or 3p to see if the scoring improves. I am told this is bad at 4p, which is my only experience so far.

This would be a good game for us. Very good with 2 players.

Basically, each player is growing a garden with cards that have empty spaces and spaces with different flower types. When you have 3 tiles of similar flowers connected, you claim them with 1 of 5 hanging gardens bits and you take a tile. The more tiles you have the more points you score; very similar to Oltre Mare commodities cards.

Play through the deck once and the game is over.

Really interesting light-medium Euro that relies on visual spatial skills. Relies somewhat on being in the right place at the right time in terms of the scoring tiles and when they come up as this game is about set collection.

In that regards it has a similar feel to Alhambra as this game also uses a series of cards to choose from and tiles to collect.

Looking forward to more of this as it is easy to learn and offers some challenging decision making.

Instead of laying a tile, you lay a 3x2 grid in orientation that you like as long as the buildings are inside your area. The idea is quite refreshing, while not very thinky, still offers a bit of challenge. The part about collecting sets for points could use a bit of work though.

Cute somewhat meditative game that reminds me of Lost Cities in how the game play *feels.*  Simple rules, quick to set up, vaguely crunchy in scoring, but entertaining.  I'm not really sure that I would call it a "tile laying" game, either.  More like a card layering puzzle.

A pleasant, puzzling tile-laying game that shines with 2p. With more players there's not as much time to create large scoring opportunities. It's a nice alternative to games like Carcassonne or Alhambra, even if its random elements limit the strategic possibilities in comparison to those classic gateways.

RATING: 6
I like the gameplay (though not having a choice of what card you get as the last player can be very frustrating) but the scoring system needs fixing. You need to collect sets of different colored tiles, but the luck of the draw can give a player that only scores sets of three a huge win over opponents whose tiles only appear on the rows where you need to build sets of 4 and 5. If I do ever own it I will come up with some kind of variant for the scoring.

RATING: 8
Typically nice components and somewhat fuzzy translation of rules from Rio Grande. Some choices of words in the rule book leave some rules pretty vague, but the main ideas to keep in mind are that you play cards in order to gain tiles, and the tiles are used for scoring. With a few plays the strategy starts to become apparent, and there is plenty of room for growth regarding strategy. 

After several games you begin to realize that sometimes you want to claim a tile just to deny to someone else who's putting together a certain series of tiles. So, although each player plays his own pile of cards and builds from it, one has to be mindful of what everyone else is doing. 

The winner is the player who can accrue the highest score based on landscape and player tiles.

People who like to feel they are in control of their decisions may not like this game because the luck of the draw on tiles can play a large part in scoring outcome. For example, the more terrain symbols on cards you can lay in a row allow you to choose from a higher number of tile stacks, yet you may find that even though you put together larger rows of terrain symbols than your opponent you ended up with too many different types of tiles, and the key to scoring highly in this game is to compile multiple copies of the same type of tile. So, sometimes simply putting together 3 consecutive pictured terrain types and thereby picking up a tile is way more important that stringing together four or more of the same, as the more tiles you pick up, and the less variety of terrain types, the better are your chances of winning. People who like to feel more 'in control' probably aren't going to like this so much.

Another great week-night game! This one is quite intriguing and fun to play! The card laying mechanic is quite unique and makes the game a refreshing change of pace from anything else you might own! The game plays relatively quickly, it's a bit of a puzzler! It plays a little like Factory Fun or Take it to the Limit...but...in a whole different way! The rules are quick to learn and simple to teach and the components are top quality!

You begin with one six block blank land card. Each round you must take another land card with a random grouping of motives. Attach it to your current land card(s) and try to create sets of 3 or more. If you get a set of 3,4 or 5 you may select a victory point tile (which you are also collecting in sets for more points) and if you get a set of 6 you may take a random tile plus one from the board!

A simple puzzle game.  Choose a card to play, but remember that the symbols on the card must be placed over an existing card.  When you score a set, place a marker on the card but the marker will restrict the placement of future cards.  When I want a quick, visually refreshing puzzle game, this fits.

This is a card-drafting game where you're trying to pick up and play cards in such a way to connect colored building icons.  Players alternate being the first one to draft, and each player in turn order chooses and plays a card from the pool.  There's a good variance in the value of the cards, and often the best card for one person is the best for everyone.  The strategy in this game wasn't really evident to me until a few plays in; it's still not my favorite but it's a decent filler at least.

This game was fine, but a bit dull. My wife and I did two player, and ended only 3 points apart, but despite the set collection, the nice tiles, and the mildly brain burney way you have to lay your cards down, the whole thing felt a little bleah. The game poses itself as a game where you build a garden, but really all it is, is a game where you have some cards that have to be placed in a certain way. When you connect strings of the same color boxes on the cards, you are allowed to take a tile, which is the thing worth points at the end. The boxes you connect then don't do anything for you, and you can cover them up to create new strings, so long as you follow some low difficulty placement rules. The real thing of this game is, complete sets to get tiles in sets. I don't think this one is a keeper. Neither of us hated nor loved it.

Cute game that doesn't overstay its welcome.  Played with the Showmanager "slide unpurchased items forward" mechanic and with all tiles face up after player took them.  I'd take away the face up and make them all face down in the future.  Update: After trying different ways, I think the rules as written are best--no to "ShowManager" tile depreciation and yes to hidden holdings.  Update again: we have been playing 2-player just about every night (1:00 to 1:10 game length).  Two player is much, much more strategic and incredibly high scoring.

This game is close to being a very good game. Two main things step up to really drag down this game to average level for me. 

The first is the whole first player mechanic. Each person gets a choice of one of four cards, and each person in turn has fewer and fewer options. First player has a huge advantage, and the last player has zero choice. Seems like the game would flow fine by just refilling the card choices as each player draws and play continues around the table. Everyone has choices every turn that way and no one just takes a card without any thought.

The second is the way the scoring tiles are introduced. To me the highest value/rarest tiles should cost the most, at least when they are drawn. But the highest value tiles can be (and have been) drawn on the cheap value space while the high value space can be consistently stocked with low value tiles. That gives no motivation to even attempt to go after the high value spaces and players just cap at three or four buildings throughout the game. Why build a five building area when a more valuable tile is always in the three building area? I'd much rather have a sliding scale where tiles devalue over time but are always introduced at a high value.

Those two complaints aside, I really enjoy the card stacking, building placement element of this game quite a bit. Many decisions and sacrifices need to be made while building through the game. The set collecting aspect of the scoring isn't bad. Overall a decent filler, but one with potential to be more than it is.

Elegant puzzle game with some nice mechanics. To my taste, the way in which scoring tiles are offered, is a bit too random, thereby not allowing real tactical choices. Starting a collection of tiles will always be a guess without even knowing whether the possibility to complete the series will occur during the game. Lacks a bit of interaction too.

Flows very quickly - get through it in around half an hour or less.  Nice amount of choices for the quick play time.

Plays very well as a 2p with the wife, she requests it.  Very non-confrontational but still a bit of competitiveness with the scoring tiles and building cards.

After one play, I am very excited about the puzzle that this 'tile-laying' & set collecting game presents!

Players draft cards to expand their 'garden' and connect like motifs. This is done by a cool overlaying mechanism (I've heard of Patchhistory using this too). The connected sets of motifs allow players to draft point-scoring tiles in an effort to complete sets of common tiles.

The art is nice and bright and the gameplay (for two players) is tantalizingly opaque and rather tactical. The game does not run TOO long, but I was buried in a bit of analysis paralysis at times in my first play.

Thanks to Tim Duong for finding me my copy- you are the best!

The Hanging Gardens -- Played three-player.

This is becoming a standby.  Classically euro: rules that take only minutes to explain, game duration of less than an hour, and involving gameplay.

When you own as many games as we do, the games whose rules are easy to remember take on added value.

This does require some facility with spatial planning.  When placing cards to create your own play field, you want to maximize the the space available for future placement -- all while placing cards such that like-colored buildings are adjacent to one another.  Furthermore, when placing temple tokens, you should keep in mind that future cards cannot be placed atop the temples, thus limiting future placement, so place those temples wisely.  Once all of your temples have been placed, new temples can only be placed by removing the temple from the region with the smallest footprint.  This means you may want to place new cards so that they reduce a region's footprint thereby speeding the removal of an inconveniently placed temple.

If placing a temple on a small area will get you the scoring tile you want, then do it.  But if the situation allows, do try to hold off and build a six-space region before scoring it.  Not only do you get a bonus tile from the face-down stacks, [i]and[/i] your choice from all of the face-up tiles, you get an additional benefit:  The bonus tile's type is unknown to your opponents.

This is a fancy dominoes-like card game with meeples.  The domino-like format could make this a quick and simple game for non-gamers, assuming that they aren't scared away from the weird scoring system.  It could also be an attempt to get women to play a game as this rather abstract game has flowery icons instead of howitzers, tanks, etc.

I'm getting really sick of these drafting games where you just draw stuff to collect points.  Venture did this game 40 years ago and was revolutionary then, and still remains fresh.  This is brand new and feels tired.  The game is all about drawlogy.  If there is a card available that works in your set up then you will succeed, if not then you won't, same goes for the point tiles.  The cards are horribly unbalanced with some just being undeniably better than others.  If you go first when these are out you are lucky, if you go first and these aren't well cue the trombone.  Most of this game is comprised of false decisions.  The cards available don't fit in too many spaces, so you lay them where they are clearly best for you, then any variation is purely guesswork.  The only real decisions in this game are when to score (although I'm almost of the opinion that you should just take as many tiles as you can just blindly churning the threes as they are essentially of the same value without combos, and the more you have the more three combos you can make), and where to place your temple.  The temple part is actually kind of intriguing.  

Where is the worthwhile interaction in this. Unlike many drafting games where players are competing for tiles, if you know that someone is going in on blue, you might want to avoid blue in hopes of not having to lose out on it.  So most of the game is avoiding competition, and playing on a personal play mat.  There is nothing for you to do when it isn't your turn, and when it is you are more inclined to help yourself that to prevent others for helping themselves.  

I wish there were more of a game here as the card building system is really cool in theory, but was done better with tiles in Java. All in all this game is dull an repetitive, completely artificial and absurdly lucky.  It is games like this that makes me wish that Euros would go back to auctions again.

After a 9-year gap and an online play: yeah, still decent but I'll knock it down 6.5->6. Decent game but the score tile acquisition just seems more random than I'd prefer.

---
1 play. Rating could go down a bit but it seems like a nice, quick, fun abstract tile-laying set-collection game. 

Cards are divided into 6 squares, some of which may be colored. Each player starts with a blank card. You put 1 card/player on display, then (in turn order) players choose one to add to their play area. New cards must be played such that all colored squares are played directly onto previously played card(s), so your hanging gardens slowly grow through the game. If you establish a cluster of 3+ like-colored squares, you can take a scoring tile from display (with 6+, get 1 bonus random tile), which is immediately replenished. Tiles of each color are worth variable VP, depending on how many tiles of that color you've collected. Start player rotates. Repeat till you've gone through the deck. Most VP (based on tiles collected) wins.

A tile layer with quite interesting mechanics, it comes very solitary but in the right game I like that, here it works for me. The puzzle aspect where you try to figure out how to create the "prettiest" garden is cool, the actual scoring with the point tiles maybe a bit too luck based but I don't mind. One of those that is good (actually much better) with only 2 players. Want to play more.

Some cool elements to it, and nice components.  I find there to be a thematic failure in that you're laying cards to create gardens, then (based on the cards you lay) drawing tiles for (apparently) different gardens, which actually score points.

Still, it's pretty fun for two players.  My wife and I enjoy it.

OK-ish placement game that reminds me a bit of Alhambra. It's very non-confrontational, which would make it very suitable as a 'spouse game'. I liked my first two plays, but after another few games, my enthousiasm is starting to taper off. This really does feel like multi-player solitaire, with only the occasional possibility to interfere with your opponents' plans, by taking a card or tile they're after. But it's pretty hard to foil somebody else's plans without passing up a better opportunity for yourself.
This is probably good for about 10 plays. In the end, I much prefer Alhambra.

Fun filler game, and not just because of its unique (in my experience) mechanic of building your garden by laying cards on top of one another so that your temples have a card under them but the empty spaces represent new areas to build in.

Pleasant game. I like the spatial aspect of it, but it seemed to have too much luck in the scoring tiles. And trying to keep cards stacked properly was a pain.

This is a unique and interesting game. It essentially boils down to a set-collection game, but the interesting garden-building rules work quite well, and it has a nice push-your-luck element as you decided whether to hold out for larger pieces of land to put your temple on. It felt a bit dry and didn't really grab me, but was a well-made and interesting game.

An excellent game of spacial analyses coupled with a nice blend of strategy and tactics.  It's a bit light and I wish it played more people, but Hanging Gardens is a great game to break the ice.  There's almost a puzzle element to the game that makes it feel quite challenging.  The art is quite nice and the overall presentation is pretty.  Eye and brain pleasing all at the same time.

Yep, another one of those: well designed, nothing wrong, but nothing that gives it something special.

I'm not really impressed with this game.  The concept is nice, but playing with the cards is not.  Cards move around too easily and can spin if you're not careful.  I can play it and have fun, but it's one game I'm considering getting rid of.

mpezaremos por THE HANGING GARDENS, estaremos de acuerdo que con esta portada no puedes esperar que la gente se tire a las tiendas a comprarlo, tampoco el tema del juego, Los jardines de Babilonia, ( temática muy manida Amyitis, Babilon, Tigris&Euprates), tampoco el objetivo del juego que es ser el mejor jardinero. ¡Si! estamos de acuerdo en que hay temas mucho más atractivos.... pero por poco ¡eh!. El caso es que me llamo la atención que su creador sea un chino Din Lin Tsan y que Uwe Rosenberg (Agricola, At the gates of Loyang, Le Havre) lo calificara con un 9.3 y dijera sobre el que es muy buen juego. El caso es que lo compré por 18 Euritos y la verdad es que es un juego de colocación de cartas en tu zona individual, tipo puzzle muy curioso, rápido y divertido, ya veras que no es tan fácil realizar las primeras combinaciones de más de 5 espacios iguales. Consiste fundamentalmente en tratar de enlazar tres espacios iguales o más para conseguir losetas que te darán puntos al final de la partida (set collection). La verdad es que me sorprendió porque es novedoso y no me da la sensación, que tengo últimamente, que siempre estoy jugando a más de lo mismo. Por cierto como juego a dos es genial (estoy actualizando la entrada de juegos para dos de este blog). Yo lo calificaría de super-filler  con chicha. La verdad es que por la rápido que se encandenan las partidas puede ser un vicio. ¡Aviso! ideal para jugar con novias/os, parejas de hecho o de cohecho, etc. De los más originales que he jugado últimamente.

A little abstract spatial card game, but it's really about set collection. I love the tiles and the art, and it's mostly a friendly, relaxing game, without much interaction. Leave plenty of room to lay out the cards, because moving them around is a challenge.

Vaguely Alhambra-like--or so I think. The tile placement seems impossible and slow initially, but players quickly get used to it. The tile collection is something like Bohnanza, but replaces the more tedious scoring of either Alhambra or Bohnanza--and scoring is mostly secret so you don't having ganging up on the leader. A nice, clean, clear, playable design. Seems to have a lot of potential for minor variations should one tire of the basic game: a very robust design in this respect; it doesn't seem as if any minor changes would hurt the game dynamics.

The lush and extravagant box art of The Hanging Gardens provides no warning of the dull experience within. Forget the intriguing theme; there's not a hanging garden in sight.

This game made for an enjoyable, even relaxing experience, in a short play time. There's a Tetris-like quality to optimizing the placement of the building cards into your garden layout. The rules and tactics aren't particularly onerous, though deciding where to place the temples can be tricky.

BGG's recommendation that this is best as a 2 player game seems to be likely right, though I would have to try in other combinations to feel sure. A 4 player game would take about the same amount of time but each player would layout half as many building tiles.

This feels almost like someone tried to make a completely average Eurogame.  Play cards to gain tiles, and collect sets of tiles for points.

Hanging Gardens is a card-laying set collection game. In turn order each player takes a card from the central draft and plays it onto his player board. However, the card must overlap other cards somehow and symbols on the card must be placed over another card. Then a pyramid can be place on any contiguous string of three or more symbols that hasn't already been chosen. There is a central area where a player can take a tile for set collection. The tile you can take depends on how large an area you placed your pyramid on.

The tiles that come out are a bit random, so there's some luck there, but the game is fairly quick and fun.

The game is simple, lightweight game and definitely not a brain-burner. The biggest issue I have is with card selection and turn order. Often times, the luck of the draw of cards is quite huge. If the card draw is good, as in two or three piece motive comes out in the draw, invariably, those cards will be taken first. So, if you get a selection of lousy cards during your turn, you will lose out on your turn. The first game we played, we just collected everything in the first column, deciding to forgo the tougher pieces. It was clear later that the winner must be patient and attempt to collect sets.

012211 - Traded away the game. Really started to dislike the sequence of tile draw and how it influences the game. You have absolutely no control over when or what tiles are drawn and cannot alter turn order

A fast, relaxing tile laying game. My wife loves this for a quick evening game.

The variability in usefulness of the cards was kind of driving me nuts here. When you get to go first, all the cards are mediocre, when you pick last, there's one fantastic card and one really crappy one. Choosing when to score is an interesting decision, but the set collection element is extraneous and just adds random to random.

A solid pleasant game for two. Forget playing with more. Willing to play, but don't need to own. Alhambra/Granada with expansions does all of this better with a lot more strategy and interaction.

played a number of times; not perfectly balanced, but quite fun in successive games one after another; a bit of random Tetris style fitting of cards, combined with Babylonian flower picking/lifestyle tiles for scoring; it's relaxing man....

My wife and I have fallen in love with this game.  The card play is innovative, and after 30 plays, I'm still finding things to think about.  The two-player game is particularly engaging.

Feels somewhat like Alhambra.  I wanted to like this more and there's a few interesting things going on, but in the end the design is lacking and the luck factor is too high.

I've played this 2 player and 3 player and both were very enjoyable.  It's a fun card laying game where you're try to match up like elements of a garden while expanding your garden to make it easier to play future cards.

I found this to be slightly boring. I didn't like the card play and the way you had to stack cards on top of another. Lavish colours but saturated colours doesn't mean saturated gameplay.

Приятная, отлично изданная игра.
Нечетное количество раундов дает некоторое преимущество первому игроку.
Надо попробовать играть в открытую: не прятать полученные тайлы. Единственный довод против - это неизвестные бонусные тайлы. Но к чему держать в памяти все остальное, когда нужно сосредоточиться только на планировании участков и знать как подгадить сопернику?

Interesting puzzle/tile-laying/set collection game. Not a lot of components but a good amount of depth. Better as a 2 player game than a 3 or 4 player game because you get 2 actions per turn instead of 1. Mechanic of overlaying cards means this game also has a fairly small footprint and is pretty portable (minus the board, which is really not necessary), making this a nice puzzle game to bring along on a trip or on the go.

This could actually be a clever interesting game if the luck of the draw/turn order issues weren't so mind-bogglingly bad.

I really like this one.  Easy to explain and plays very fast (30 minutes).  The card play mechanism is really innovative.  The scoring is less so, but all in all, a really enjoyable filler.

amount of luck far too high for my taste, otherwise a nice game. What's the point of cards with *3* adjacant items of the same kind? And what if the tiles you started to collect just don't show up at all?

Picked up from Leisure Games in London without knowing much about this.Each player builds their own version of the 'Hanging Gardens' following simple rules. There isn't much player interaction or opportunity for screwage but it made for a really relaxing game with a lot of scope for developing new strategies and new patterns. I played with my wife and she really enjoyed it. For her this was a 9. Definitely recommended.

Update: We continue to play this regularly and it is now a 9 for me as well.

The title would be better applied to a dark, introspective western: where whiskey is chased with blood and nooses of all shapes and sizes swing mysteriously in the dry heat.

The game itself is decent spatial/set collection filler that's worth a few more plays, but not much more.

Develop your land for temples to get scoring tiles. Set collecting is the main objective. Very good game.

I won this game ages ago in a G4GG lotto, played it once, didn't really love it, lotto'ed it away. It came to Yucata a few months after that and I've loved it ever since. Kinda wish i still had the physical copy, and may end up getting it again at some point!
Takes a few runs to really grasp what you're doing- but it's a great, interesting mechanism I've not seen elsewhere.

While the concept of building on top of existing structures (in this case in the form of gardens on cards) isn't exactly a new one, I did find the way this idea was utilized in the game to be somewhat interesting, especially with the restriction that the landscapes must be supported from below.  Strategy is fairly lite here and in my opinion is only found in two things: the placement of the temple in such a way so that you can easily split the group you've formed and then use as much of the leftover as possible to construct another set with minimal effort; the other is to leave yourself with enough empty sites so you can extend without having to bury current motive unnecessarily, this is of utmost importance when you are picking last.

Of course luck is extremely prominent here in terms of what kind of landscape cards come up as well as the selectable scoring tiles.  For its length, The Hanging Gardens is not a bad way to spend 45 minutes to an hour.  I think it should appeal to people who especially enjoy spatial games (like Ubongo).

A card game with a strong spatial component and a bit of set collection.  Placing the pyramids well is surprisingly difficult.

It's pretty but the scoring tiles need some work so they can be more easily differentiated.

After 2+ Plays: I wanted to like this game.  While the parts work together well enough, there's nothing that elevates it above the many other tile laying and set collection games.

6/23/08 - Hans Im Gluck really does make the trophy girlfriends of boardgames.  But, as for the game, Hanging Gardens doesn't appear to be anything too special after 2 plays (4x and 2x players).  Jessie really likes the premise, however, so it will probably stick around for a while.

Escoge una carta y añádela a tu mapa. Los edificios deben quedar sobre otra carta. Si formas un grupo de edificios del mismo tipo puedes puntuar y recibir una loseta. Las losetas puntuan por sets.

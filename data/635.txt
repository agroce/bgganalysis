A really good game -- I may have to rate it higher.  The kids and I have been playing it nightly and it's been a fun way to end the day.  It's neither strategic nor tactical, and the decisions aren't complicated, but it's still fun watching everybody trying to elbow each other's cars out of the way for first place.

Lately, this is the most played game in our house.  Instant setup and clean-up, and lots of fun in-between.

A very fast fun game with lots of chaos and luck.  There is some strategy, but most of it is lost in the chaos...

An exciting game that is a but high on luck, but due to the player interaction and the sometimes heated atmosphere this is a fun game.

However those who play the last cards have a considerable higher advantage.

Tepid game where the first half of each &quot;race&quot; means almost nothing. Anyone who can play six races at one sitting deserves a winner&#039;s cup.

RATING: 4
Well, it scales, and it's fast.  I can say that.  Production sucked for me, and I think the game itself is a classic execution of modern Knizia: a fully functional, no particular holes kind of game that feels pretty craptastic in actual play.

A quick and simple game that has a strong "take-that" element and tons of randomness. For a beer and pretzel filler, I can tolerate it. But in the end, the game play is chaotic and being last, at the end of the game, is more important than any decision you'll make during the game.

Luck plays a big part in this game, and the first half doesn't really matter (unless your car gets eliminated). Doesn't feel much like F1 - all the cars line up and you play cards to change position. Everyone lost interest after about 5 plays. Traded my copy

Another of the Knizia lightweights that isn't bad, but degrades fairly rapidly. This was only good for 3-4 plays for me before becoming rather boring. Possibly of interest as a "gateway" game that is non-threatening to sucker in you family & friends, depending on what they like ... but not a great game regardless.

I recently put together an extended 10-player version.  (I had 4 more colours of cars of exactly the same style as in the original game.)  Most of the recent games have been of this version.
2014-05-16
Tried playing (4p) with a random pick of colour - which was kept secret from the other players.  It was an experiment that will be repeated.
2014-10-9
These days it seems to be 10-player version with random and secret pick of racing team.
2015-05-23
Next idea: 3 or 4 cards for each team.
Each player receives a card so more than
one player COULD be running for the same
team!

RATING: 8
A quick auto-racing based card game.  I like that eliminated players can still affect the outcome of the race, even if their cars are no longer in the race.

If there is anything that can be improved with this game, it's the colors on the cards.  Some of the colors look very close to matching, which has caused some confusion in past games.  If the game is reprinted, it would be nice to see either text ("orange," "Blue," etc.) on the cards, or different colors.

A cute little game that inspires bouts of vengeance, wall crashing, lead stealing, and all out fun and vicious game-play.  This game plays similar to WoC's Guillotine where you’re modifying the order of things by using card to affect the game.  Simple to play, quick to learn, and decent replay value.

Quick to play, but too simple for my tastes. It seems to me that the only strategy is to keep your team's cards in hand for end-game and to play the opponents' cards as soon as you can. Obviously if you manage to draw your team's cards…

RATING: N/A
IMO If playing with a small number of players, roughly split the deck in half after shuffling. Too many players (5 or more) spoil this as the final round of plays always changes this lot and this means that the first couple of players to play have little or no say in the final positions. A favourite of our wargame group if 20/30 minutes or so are left after the main game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Completely stupid, but it's also a lot of fun and that means a lot more than mechanics to me.  Usually inspires some great trash talking and making moves just to irritate other players in retailiation for getting screwed.  A nice little game, better than a lot of Knizia games that get higher marks.  I love GMT, but they really have no business producing little games like this with their boring-ass line art- it works for historical games, but not for this.

One play - I like it, but as a short filler is a little too dependent on luck of the cards.  And going last (in card play) is a powerful position.  On the other hand if you play three races as the rules suggest then you're suddenly talking about an hour ... and as likeable as this game is as a filler, I don't think there's enough there to support an hour.

RATING: 5
Like most race games, it really wants more players.  The race is positional.  Cards get played to change the relative positions of the cars (green moves up two, orange moves back one, etc.)  Some special cards can hose other players, and some of those require a d12 roll to actually happen.  An OK way to pass the time.

RATING: 3
Cute as a filler, but not much game there.  It all comes down to whoever has the best cards at the end (and going last can be a huge advantage).  90% of play has practically no bearing on the outcome.  I love auto racing games, but I can't get excited about this one anymore.

Probably best for playing with young kids and non-gamers.  It'll come off my shelf again when my son is old enough to understand it, but not likely before then.

Update: My son is 2 and FMR is off the shelf!  He loves any sort of car toy (especially very small ones), so I use the Pit Crew cards and plastic cars as a color-matching game for him.  He's really into it.

Update: My son is 3 and can mostly understand the rules, but he'd rather play Monza or simplified Daytona 500 (and so would I).

A very fun quick filler (just hold as many races as you have time for). Quick to teach and a high luck element which can be evened out over several races. I've also played it 2-player. Just give each player 2 teams, but keep one hidden (ie you only know the colour of one of your opponents teams).

Quick playing game that pretty much anyone can pick up and play. It doesn’t have the depth of some of the more popular racing games (Forumla D / Downforce) but it gives you that racing feel and experience in a short 10-15 minute match. String a few together for a championship and you have a good hour long game that doesn’t overstay it’s welcome.

Excellent remake of the old Gibson Games version. There is no track to this game, the cars race based on relative position to each other. Each player runs two cars. On a turn each player plays one of five cards from their hand to influence the race positions in some way, then draws a replacement card. Play ends when the deck runs dry and each player is down to four cards. Points are awarded for the first six positions then set them up again for the next race. Very much a "hah, take that!" sort of game - lots of laughs. The new addition improves by adding the text for the special cards to the card itself - no more trying to remember what the special cards do!

Not really a "racing game" so much as a "valet parallel parking game."

It’s pretty light and chaotic. The granularity of the scoring requires multiple rounds, which gets repetitive. Players can be actually or virtually eliminated. Knizia and the state of the art have improved since this was designed back in 1995.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Does this game rate a 7 in comparison to the grand scheme of things?  Probably not.  But for a pick-up-and-play game, it totally fits the bill.  The game is incredibly simple and easy to understand, great to fill the gap or even just get something under your belt.  There's a little strategy involved and all the components are serviceable.  In fact, I think the cards are a little too good for what the game is, but that's the standard GMT card stock.

While Formula Racing isn't the greatest racing game or the greatest Knizia game, it's a wonderful thing in a small package, and you can get several races banged out in no time.  If you want a step up, try Race! or Thunder Alley, but if you just want to tote something around for a good beer-n-pretzels game, it's perfect.

RATING: 8
This little game has some major plus point. A) It's fast B) it's easy to teach C) It has a small footprint and so is great for confined spaces D) It works very well, especially if a "season" is played out over an hour or so. There are some very nice tactical elements to the random card draws and an overall strategy can be held to, though it's often foiled by last turn plays of the other players. Lots of fun.

Fun light game. More like Guillotine than Formula De, but the theme works as a light card game more than the average Knizia outing. You really need to play a few games in a row (3-4) to be fair and let the luck balance out a bit. Keeping your color secret makes it much more fun. Traded.

Played 2 times. Simple card game that feels a bit like a car race. But mostly a fun card game of jockeying for position. GMT version is $16+ right now, and that&#039;s for a deck of cards and some very small plastic dice. Too expensive for what it is. Pity, good game that would be a hit if published by Hasbro. Good filler, with a fun little theme, and the jockeying for position is kind of a fun way to &quot;race.&quot;

RATING: 7
End game needs tweeking otherwise the very last player is the kingmaker every time.  A random finish is better suited.  We play with a house rule where the person taking the last card rolls a die; on a 1 the game is over, otherwise the next player has a go and ends on a 1-2, etc.  This removed my main pet peeve of perfect information and it hads some drama.

It's fun with kids... Or a game group that acts like kids!  Hand management and risk management.  Nice and short.

Note: Daytona 500 and Detroit Cleveland Grand Prix have lowered my opinion of this race game.  Formula Motor Racing is more portable but the others are more interesting and so much better!  In the racing world Kramer beats Knizia.

RATING: 6
Silly, quick, and completely chaotic filler with a lot of take that. Each turn play one card depicting some sort of race event (overtaking, spin-outs, etc.). Often times multiple cars can benefit from cards (e.g. by slip-streaming), and for extra mayhem, many of the cards affect a random car determined by rolling the die.

The fun is not so much in the largely random race results, but in hitting the other players over the head with a very large wrench.

Has got more interesting with each play, so still table worthy (however, person who plays last card really can have a significant impact) (rating 7 31/12/08).  Just think this is not as good as I would like, and the end game seems to make it a bit unfair with too much weighting to the last player, rating decrease from 7 to 5 (23/10/11). UPDATE: I have tried very hard to like this game, but it's a dud. Unfair advantage to those who play last.  Game tends to get a tepid response from all participants when it is played, so archive and lower rating reduced from 5 to 3 (5/1/12).

Neat little racing filler.  I wouldn't want to play it very often, but I enjoy it when I do.  It really does nothing to simulate racing, but the play for position is intriguing.

Yes, two players. I added a house rule about each player handling two teams each, two teams are left uncontrolled by players (as per 4/5 player games) and a die roll before the game decides how many cards should be discarded unseen.
In fact I feel the game works better with some teams uncontrolled by the players, so that rules out 3 and 6 player games.

Sold. A good game, but it never seemed like there was a good time to play it, so I put it up for sale here and away it went.

It's quick and can be fun, but it breaks down after several plays. The cars add a lot of flavor, and the theme works pretty well in my book. The main problem has been stated many times though: really only the last few cards played matter. You can move both your cars from dead last to 1st and 2nd in only two turns, theoretically. Sometimes other players will even inadvertently help you. Best way to win is to go last, and save your best cards until then. Playing to win can be somewhat frustrating, as other players often thwart you by accident. I would play it, but I would rather play something else.

A short car racing game where you don't use a race track ...you keep track of positions 1st through 12th by moving cars backward and forward in a row using a card deck of moves and some simple movement rules. Plays pretty fast and is quite chaotic ... not sure if there is a strategy here but I enjoyed the game. Would have been better if they had supplied a placement board with the game.

A riot.

It has more take-that, cut-and-thrust than most Knizia games, and if you want a quick, fun, very interactive racing game to play over a beer, look no further. It's very portable too - I took in on a recent cycle trip with friends and it was the (game) hit of the tour.

That many cards force you to move a car of a specific colour plus the one behind it makes the card play far more tactical than just just moving a single car would allow.

You can play a series of races (we did) for a bit more strategy, but a single race win can be enough to take the series, as often you find the non-player cars win due to the amount of abuse flying about

Light, chaotic game with more than a little luck.  Fun every now and again.  Last game I played (over 3 races with 2 cars in each) all but one of my cars crashed out by no fault of my own.  This can be humorous if you are playing in a light-hearted manner, but doesn't allow much strategic planning.

Este é um jogo de F1 jogado nas boxes. Jogando as cartas ajudamos os dois bólides da nossa escuderia, e lixamos a vida aos outros. Claro está que os outros fazem o mesmo.

This isn't really very good as a racing game, even though I'm not even a big fan of racing games to begin with, it's more of a little lightweight filler.  It's kind of fun, moving the cars around, but there is really very little control.  Your cards severely limit your choices, and then any planning can be guaranteed to really go out the window once the other players start playing.  It seems like total chaos, which is okay for one race, but I'm not sure I'd want to do three.  Two at a maximum would be okay.

I play this with my kids a lot, and it's a good game.  I'd like to graduate to three races someday.  We mostly just play to pass the time, learn how to take turns and play cards... eventually we'll get there.  They are currently 6, 5, and 3.  The 6 year old has some strategy.

For a screw-your-neighbor card game that is mostly luck, this one plays well and gives you a greater feeling of control over the outcome than you probably have.  The theme works well with this Knizia design.  I like this one more than I should.  A good game when looking for something light.

Fantastic simulation of a racing game!!  Scales well for any number of players (2 to 6) and plays fast.  Anyone can play it and is very easy to teach.  Can take any amount of time that you want to dedicate to it, so it can be a main game or a light filler.  Tonnes of possibilities to customize the rules for qualifying, points, hidden cars, etc.  Nice change of pace to many of the racing games out there.

Quick card game in which cards are played to change the position of cars in a Formula 1 race. There are 12 cars, 2 of each colour. Many cards may be only be used on a car of a specified colour (which may not be your own colour). Cards allow overtaking (with slipstreaming), charging, crashing, spinning out etc. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of the most underappreciated filler games I have ever played.  I don't usually care for Reiner Knizia's work, but this is one of the few games that got my attention.  You can setup and teach this game in five minutes, thanks to the instructions on the cards.

The entire premise of the game is you have a pair of cars in the race and you are trying to manipulate the 12 car lineup to get your drivers at the front at the end of the race.  At the end of the race, the top six drivers score points.  After 3 races, whoever has the most points wins.

What's important is people can move the lineup by manipulating cars that are not theirs.  This is where "take that" gameplay kicks into effect.

And just like any racing events, there are things that you can't control.  Crashes, people spinning out, and other nasty events are determined by the twelve-sided die.

Because of the constant changing of positions, the game feels very thematic.

RATING: 6
Reminds me of Guillotine, but i like this one better, as you have more influence on the other players. Rather than gaining point cards each turn, in FMR, scoring is postponed until the end of each round, bringing in the tension of jockeying for position, wondering what position you'll end up in. Simple and well done.

This is quick and quite good fun, though a little too luck-based to treat very seriously. There is some strategic element in choosing which card to play, but it's easier to screw an opponent than to make good choices for yourself. The die has quite an effect, too, but it's fine. Just don't expect to devise strategies to win - keeping others from 1st place is easier, and that's where the fun comes from.

Not Kinizia's best, but not his worst either. The game feels pretty random (why would you want to run a whole season of 17 races is beyond me), but at 15-20 min/race, it's short enough to come to the table every now and then. There's nothing really special about this game either way (neither good nor bad).

Formula motor racing with cards. Each player controls two cars in a race. Play a card to move cars forwards or backwards. Special cards can put cards out of the race. Play over three rounds. Easy card game from Knizia. Decisions are relatively easy, hope the crash card doesn't hit you, and optimize your position. It was fun and fresh when it first came out, but now it is rarely suggested. 

There is a lot of luck. It's one of those games where you can introduce to people to get them into the hobby.

RATING: 5
The strategy is simple - keep your best card for your last card and hope you get to go last! Even though you have a decision each turn on what card to play, any control is an illusion. It's a complete luck-fest, your result is at the mercy of the cards the others play, and it's overly weighted to whoever gets to play last, where they should take the lead and win the race. And if you play multiple races so everyone has a shot at going last, then the overall game should end up even as well, except for outrageous luck going against someone. Its saving grace is the short playtime, allowing it to come out as a filler, or with the kids, where you can enjoy the ride of creating carnage for other people whilst you're getting ready to play a real game.

I enjoy playing this and picked it up at PrezCon a few years ago because I thought the kids would like it, too.  Not so much.

RATING: 7
An excellent example of making a well-themed game so simply. However because other players have the potential to move your car(s) means things can get upsetting for those wanting some control. GMT version is better as the effects are written on the cards, rather than having to refer to the one copy of the rules in the Gibson Games edition. If you can tolerate take that play, good fun. My quibble with it is that the constant shifting of cars is spatially repetitive and fiddly, and the card distribution maybe too detailed to commit to memory to play well. Yet for me this is still the best car racing simulation I've come across. Rating based on 3 players.

This Knizia card game was, for a fair while in 2014, a regular thing in my local gaming group - we played a version adapted for 10 players, and played a whole "season" of races. I've not actually played the original - I suspect it will be much better with just 3 or 4 players, but it's really just too random to be a good game. There are so few decisions as well, most are obvious (if you have a card in your hand that moves you forward, you play it, as it probably won't move you forwards next turn). It's OK as an occasional game, but I'm surprised Knizia, who usually can be relied upon to design games requiring skill and thought (and this applies even to most of his many light card games) thought it worth publishing this one.

Extra point because even my 3-year-old can "kind of" play it. He lives for the CRASH. If you play multiple races, there is some strategy, but if just one race, it is all luck if everyone playing is competent.

My kids really enjoy this game. It's fairly simple, colorful, and the idea of stringing games out along a season gives everyone a chance to win a game here and there while deciding an overall winner. Older players might find the game a bit repetitive, so it might have been nice to make an expansion set that had some different cards and effects. Overall, it's a good quick game to play, that requires little setup, little reading, and has a quick learning curve.

A fairly fast playing (though it drags a little with 5 or 6) 'take that' race game.Players control 2 cars which are then raced along a line with the play of cards.

Far too many 'take that' elements leads to kingmaking and randomness uncommon to Kniza's designs.

Case in point: I played my first hand by blindly choosing and executing a card each turn. At the end of the race, I came in Second. What the?!

Very simple light racing game. There is some very minor strategy/hand management, but really it is mostly a chaotic and luck-heavy "Take That" game. It works without being exhausting.  It is all so silly and over quick enough that it remains fun 'til the end of three races. 

The drafting really makes the game something special.

A light racing game where you're jockeying for relative rather than absolute position: card play moves your around in position 1-12 (like Guillotine), although some cards can cause crashes which remove car(s) from the race. Plays quickly. Somewhat random (card draw, dice rolling) but still some room for a bit of card management since you play multiple races.

RATING: 5
A very simple "racing" game where cards are played to move cars up or down spots in a line of 12 cars. This mechanic means it doesn't feel all that much like a race game, but Formula Motor Racing is a harmless, quick little diversion. The power swings of the cards are huge (all the way from weak otions like move something up one spot to overpowered abilities like being able to take two cards out of the race), and the chaos is amplifed by die rolls. All of which is at least palatable, as the game is over quickly. Not a keeper for me, but I supect this would be a "filler" game hit in some circles that enjoy lighter fare.

Quite a decent little game that's had a fair few runs out since I acquired it via a charity shop in Cheadle Hulme - I mean who kicks out a Reiner game to the PDSA? Are the people of Cheadle Hulme clinically insane?

Any road (or track) up, it's fun. It takes longer than advertised - if you run a full 6 race series, you'll take a fair bit of time, possibly about 2 hours or more, so that 'filler' epithet's not really applicable.

But it is fun, fun, fun. Carnage is legion, as is treachery, and the inevitable crash cards are simply the sign of desperate people. And I like that sort of thing.

Beer and pretzels elegance!!!  Perfect dilemna between "take that" and improve your position.  Well, unless you can do neither.... great times.  Perfect dice roll suspense.  Probably varies depending on the game group.  I like the people in our game group so this is a blast.  Plus, if you "need" control... this isn't the game for you.  If you "need" fun, well check this title out.

Three plays in.  Three laughter fun filled games.  This game probably isn't a 7, but every time this has been pulled out, its been just a wonderful gaming experience.

The fact that going in, you just know you are at the mercy of your cards makes it fun.  Everything being relative, so you are probably in it until the last round makes it exciting.

Boy, did we liked [thing=635][/thing]!

It is a racing game, but without a proper track: the cars are put in spots, going from 1st to 12th, and everytime a cars passes other, what changes is only the position of the cars in this twelve spots track - so they change places relative one to the other, but, say, the distance from the 5th place to the 1st is always the same (four spots). Therefore, no one can really stray from the others, nor be left way behind, which can appear to be a downer in a racing game, but it works great, because everyone is always alive in the, even if one of the cars goes from first to last (as once happened to me).

The gameplay is pretty straightfoward: every race uses 12 cars, and the every player uses the team of two cars of the same color, the cars that no one took, stay as "dummy/robots/small teams" cars - they can still score points, and even win the whole thing! In each turn, the player must use a card, applying its effects. Most of the cards are Overtake cards, which must be used in a car of the color of the card (this means that is very usual for someone move ahead a car of someone else's), but the card directly behind the one moving also moves ahead. The other cards can either allow the player to select a car or to roll the die and see which car will be affect by the card. Though there are some nasty effects, usually the card require a die roll, with a big chance of nothing happening, or the die roll will affect a random car - so there is a fine amount of "take that" in the game, but is far from bothersome, not only because the races are really fast (lasting around 20 minutes), but also because everyone has two cars, so even if one of yours goes out of the race (the worst thing that can happen), you are still in the contest. The cards have effects like: wrong line, pit stop, crash, spin out, charge, tailender turbo, and so on.

[thing=635][/thing] can be played as a filler (only one race) or in a series of races (which I think is the best way), counting points for pilots and constructors/teams. We played this way and is was a blast. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the game, I had almost to beat people to take it out of the table. I guess it will be even better with 5 or 6 players, since everyone will have eyes on the prize. [thing=635][/thing] is easy to teach and play, really fun, being, as a big surprise to me, probably the best racing game I played (but I have only played two that I can remember: [thing=37904][/thing], wich I never liked very much, and [thing=58110][/thing], which I enjoyed).

It is important to say that [thing=635][/thing] isn't a simulation of a race, not even close:  it doesn't have climate, safety car, different tires, fuel, gears; it doesn't, as I said, have a track (and, by extension, nothing like curves, late or early breaks, number of laps, and other things you have when you use an actual race track). It is a card game, in which the cards affect the cars in a line. Just this, nothing more. Also, [thing=635][/thing] isn't an strategic game, even in the smallest bit: it is all tatics, luck to be in the right place when someone uses an Overtake in you car, with some major swings (one can easily go from 1st to one in the last places, in one round, without having no control on this, since you can't interrupt the plays of others - but you can talk them out of (or into) doing something). Even in [thing=37904][/thing], with its tons of dice rolling, you get more control (using breaks, gears, motor, and such).

What [thing=635][/thing] indeed is: a fast (one race lasts around 20 minutes), fun, easy to teach and to play game. Has loads of interaction and, by playing several races, things get even more fun, because every position matters, specially if you play with the constructors variant (and I don't see why anyone would want to not play with it).

Simply one of the most fun games I got to know so far this year.

Stupid and silly, and that's probably the best I can say for it.  No better than mass market cardgame schlock like [gameid=1269].  It's really up to luck of the draw, and even after that it's often up to luck of the dice.  The decisions are nearly non-existent.  Maybe an okay game for kids?  Oh, and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/52]GMT[/url] does not do this kind of lighthearted art so well.  The card backs are boooooring, and the illustrations on the playing face of the cards are static, which is about the worst possible choice you can make for the art on a game about car racing.

A perfectly okay racing game with a small bit of risk and take that. Meh.

RATING: 5.7
Really fast racing filler game with some take-that card play. It takes so little time to play this that I'd never really object to joining in.

Good Times! Large random element certainly makes things unpredictable, but it doesn't detract from the Fun Factor for me!

A nice clever fast-paced game. Unfortunately the advantage of ending the game is too big.

Although I gave Formula Motor Racing an average score, I did had fun playing it.  I like the card-driven mechanics for the gameplay, and there are a lot of clever abilities that allow you to screw with the other players.  However, the fact that you often draw cards you cannot use, as well as the general feeling of your inability to actually control the outcome of your pieces made it seem like you've accomplished nothing by the end.  Mindless fun and good for a few laughs.

Fast-played and interesting game mechanic. Unfortunately it gets a little repetative after a few games. And, more importantly, it lacks the racing spirit.

Interesting mechanisms advance or wreck your cars in this odd little race game that actually feels kind of right.  It's interesting to watch it play out, and your tactical choices are unusual; however, in replicating the suspense of the race, the players' cards are mostly tossed about by the effects of the cards.  In other words, interesting to watch while you play, but you aren't doing as much playing as watching, even on your own turn.

After 1 Play: Your actions in the first 80% of each round seem totally irrelevant unless you are unlucky enough to have a car removed from the race.  Additionally, there is a huge advantage to the player who acts last.

Fun, quick playing... One off games aren't as fun as a series... Playing with three or six is best cause it gives everyone equal turns

Massive " take that " gameplay

I don't know why I preordered this.  It looks pretty dull and I'm not excited about playing it at all.

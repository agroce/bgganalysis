GAME: Andromeda
RANK: 2175
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
FUN! , a little tricky to learn, but fairly easy play by second round. 2-3 odd things to watch out for; don't discard 'jokers' with other cards, etc. Just OK card material but other decent components, beautiful board - interesting trade procedure and fun 'unstable wormhole' or 'planet ring' device. Good-looking board and very good instructions. It does suffer from some luck and somewhat limited opportunities for choice and strategy/tactics.

see the extensive variant I wrote in the game's Forum.

Andromeda is a fun game with light strategy. Beautiful graphics on the cards and board elevate the experience. There's a strong emphasis on luck but you still have to make a few key decisions or your cosmic dust. It plays fast enough to get 2 or 3 sessions in an afternoon (with food and drink in between). Not Alan Moon's strongest design but still very playable and enjoyable.

Longer game than it probably should be.  A really intelligent mix of great mechanics.  There's ways of mitigating the luck, but the game is still quite luck-y.  Good graphics, good design.  Did I mention it was long?

Rating based on one play.  Another unique draw mechanism, the hockey puck.  Much more interesting than a draw bag, and part of what makes the game.  Of course you've got to be comfortable with luck, but that's the reason why you didn't win wasn't it.

The card trading takes a bit getting used to with 3.  I think that 4 would be a best number.  Might start getting downtime issues with 5.

RATING: 6
A fun, light game with a double luck element: card drawing and the cosmic puck/ashtray battles. While you can get screwed over, I found that these elements added tension and excitement to the game. In the end, you just have to play the odds (Settlers anyone). A fun end-of-week or end-of-work-day game to play with friends and family.

Not really nice to look at, but the game presents two interesting things.  The exchanging cards mechanics is quite nice, and the item included ("meneador") to extract random cubes is quite unique... and fun.  It plays nicely, but in case of unlucky people, the game can get a bit too long.

{3P: 8, 4P: 8, 5P: ???}

[i]Andromeda[/i] has been hanging around on the edge of my radar for quite some time.  The comments from my group of "correlated" GeekBuddies weren't stellar enough to launch this game into the "must have" category.  However, its recent status of being out-of-print meant that I could not postpone its acquisition any longer.  A few mouse clicks later, and UPS delivered its payload to my door.

Now, a little about me: [geekurl=/geeksearch.php?action=search&advsearch=1&objecttype=boardgame&q=&include[designerid]=9&searchown=ON&searchuser=Beowulf]I like Alan R. Moon titles[/geekurl].  I have found them to be colorful, thematic, and easy to teach.  [i]Andromeda[/i] is no different: the board is gorgeous, and the rules are straightforward.  The theme is a bit hurky jerky: fostering interstellar trade by establishing "economic centers" on the satellites of seven planets in the Andromeda galaxy.  I'd prefer something along the lines of space colonization, so that's what I have in mind when I'm playing.

Like [family=17]other games of his[/family], [i]Andromeda[/i] is primarily a set collecting game.  This mechanic is well-worn, and needs a little extra push to be interesting.  Here, the "push" comes from forced trading: the starting player must trade cards with someone else.  Every other player has to offer the same number of cards, even though these cards may not end up being traded with anyone.  This forced interaction is the heart of the game.  It is slightly reminiscent of the card drafting in [i][thing=25554]Notre Dame[/thing][/i].  It doesn't bother me, but if you prefer having a choice à la [i][thing=13]The Settlers of Catan[/thing][/i], then this aspect of [i]Andromeda[/i] will be grating.

Finally, we get to the Cosmic Puck/Ashtray.  I'll sidestep the pseudonym debate, and refer to the game piece by its official name: the Planet Ring.  The Ring is the randomizing element that determines whether or not your attempt to establish [-]a colony[/-] an economic center on a satellite will be successful.  And this is the one element that will make or break [i]Andromeda[/i] for you.  Think of it as [i][thing=30869]Thebes[/thing][/i] in space: you strategize and then execute your plan merely for an [i]attempt[/i] at success.  I'm not crazy about this mechanic.  I enjoy being rewarded with concrete success after all of my efforts.  However, at least with [i]Andromeda[/i] a negative result for me also reduces my opponents' chances for success by removing their "stations" (a.k.a. "wooden cubes") from the planet.  The fun of shaking the Ring combined with a beneficial result for failure makes [i]Andromeda[/i] less of a heartbreaker.

Other games offer more complexity than [i]Andromeda[/i].  There is admittedly a lot of luck involved.  However, [person=9]Alan R. Moon's[/person] games have a knack for actually making it to the table, and they're fun to play.  My family enjoys them, and that fact propels my rating an additional point.

[i]Updated: 8/29/10, Rated: 7[/i]

Here we are three and a half years later, and [i]Andromeda[/i] hasn't seen the table very often.  The added propulsion has stalled, and [i]Andromeda[/i] coasts to a "7."

Game centers around set collection and risk management. Luck can play a big role so if you're not up for that you better stay clear. The trading mechanism is very clever and gives opportunity for screwage between the players. All in all a medium light game that plays quickly and has a lot of interaction between the players. Will have to try to play this more often.

I didn't play this alas, but watched and had eye witness reports, so perhaps the rating isn't all that sound. But comparisons form respected gamers were thumbs down, random, luck based, reminsicnet of The Magnificent Race, kiddies game, waste of time, etc. The trading system was laudable, but fit into the framwork of a game which rewarded pure chance above anything else. If that's an unjust description, by all means PM me ;-).

Player counter density is far too small for such a random game.  Get a bad draw from the "cosmic ashtray" on a planet or two and you are effectively out of the game.  Still, other creative mechanics keep this from getting a lower score in my book.

RATING: 7
7+ plays, 3p, 4p x2, 5p. Good mix of mechanisms and nice artwork. Lots to consider, including luck management (luck with cards as well as the Cosmic Puck) and sometimes a lot of luck. At best I even feel intimations of El Grande (which I love). At worst I feel I have no chance at all due to the luck factor. Sometimes the player who doesn't take time to upgrade technology, and instead pushes luck for simple colonization, wins--I like this. My mixed feeling for the game became more clearly positive over time.

Eh.  Absolutely average on every level.  The space theme is pretty transparent and the attempt at incorporating development tracks is only halfway there.  Just an average area majority game where having a majority of the cubes in an area simply increases your chances of expelling one from the so-called "Cosmic Ashtray".  Typical, redundant Moon mechanics that babysit the player and prohibit decision making.

Andromeda you can look at in two ways. The first way, that of the connoisseur, is one of contempt. There is nothing redeeming in this title: the 'cosmic ashtray' is nothing but a souped-up die (or, in 2015-terminology, a shared cube-building bag) which makes and breaks everyone's game. Don't be fooled by the various tracks which are supposed to 'mitigate' matters: yes, they of course alter the odds, but you'll be 'rolling' far too few times to really notice matters. It's odds we're dealing with, and results of small samples of those odds to boot. There is very little you can do to influence such a pattern, and under these circumstances the game is both pointless and a drag. It's not really 'broken', but neither does it do anything worthwhile meaning it would get a 2. It gets one bonus point for execution and evovative artwork though.

On the other hand, Andromeda is clearly intended as a lightweight family game, to be played with young children (or somewhat elder kids if they're not really into boardgames). I'm quite sure they'll love the idea of shaking the ashtray and slowly pulling it aside; and if they learn in the process that you can increase the odds of your cubes appearing in various ways then I suppose that it not a bad lesson to learn. (Using this knowledge effectively will need to occur in a different game, though.) Consequently I no longer think it fair to rate the game according to my usual standards, and have therefore withdrawn the rate.

RATING: 7
Components: Beautiful board and cards, with all information laid out functionally. The board does a great job of evoking the theme.

Experience: My opinion of this game has cooled over time. Whereas I once found it interesting and didn't mind the luck, I now find it less interesting and more chaotic. It's a bit long for what boils down to two decisions per turn: what to trade, and how to spend my actions. The trading is somewhat interesting, but is usually straight forward, and so not enough to carry the game. The actions are also typically straight forward, dependent on the cards in my hand. And shaking the puck is very capricious.

Pleasant family game where players are trying to found mining bases on planetry systems. The players achieve this by acquiring and playing sets of cards. The key feature of the game is the &quot;galactic ashtray&quot;, an unusual device to determine if a colony is founded successfully. Fun game, but those who lose will say there is too much luck!

RATING: 2
Yet another example of Moon appropriating El Grande and failing again. Lots of card-trading to build sets... which let you improve your odds at scoring with the "Space Puck". Vaguely interesting card-trading phase, but what it gains you on the board is lame and it is overly long for what it is. Felt like Slapshot's card-trading meets El Grande scoring. 

Soulless and unthematic in the extreme. Along with Capitol it is part of Alan Moon's famous "Undead Soulless Cyborg Games" series.

2013-12-24 : High luck factor, but plays fast and is fun
2017-06-18 : Played it again and someone at the table was having the worst of luck and having no fun at all - and that's ok, as long as the game doesn't drag on, which it kinda did. The end result was a tie - including both tie-breakers - between 2 players which really felt unsatisfactory. This is one of the those things that make this game feel dated.

RATING: 6.5
Enjoyable, with a nice central trading routine, but a bit long for what you get. Nice board and graphics, good options when your turn is around, good balance, but it just plays a half hour too long. I'm surprise this is from 1999. I wonder if Alan Moon is thinking of re-visiting Andromeda. *** Down graded to 6.5 after a totally sucky game. Had no cards to do what I wanted, couldn't offer cards others wanted. Suck suck suck.

RATING: 4
* Played 10+ times. Light-medium game. Really nice art (especially nice because it's space, and not castles and knights like every other game). High in the luck department, but really neat trading phase, and the luck part (shaking the cube) is fun. Passes the non-gamer test! It does drag a bit with gamers who might overthink -- this game is just not suited for that. ((Bought from F; sold to friend.))

Rate: 7...6...5

RATING: 8
With many different areas to keep track of and so many ways to spend your cards, every decision weighs in the balance.  An intricate mix of randomness (draw of cards, the starting positions and the Puck) blended with risk management (what to advance and when to transport).  The end game reminds me of a game of Medieval Merchants with many players: if you're not paying attention, the game can end in a flash and you don't want to be caught empty-handed with your last go.  Lots of fun during those cringing trade rounds where you may be forced to give out way more than you normally would.  Nice twist.  In fact, there lots of neat ideas which are new mechanics altogether.  That puck really forces some tough choices; do you wait until you have a commanding position before shuffling or do you still try just to weaken your opponents' positions (although they do get a VP out those expelled cubes...)?  Excellent game.

The action works well, and I really like the idea of coupling majority with randomness. Unfortunately you don't get to shuffle the space puck often enough to even-out the luck factor. That wouldn't be a problem if the game was really quick, but it realy feels too long clocking in around 1h30 with 5 players.

A good balance of probability, trading and set collection mechanics.  I do love the art on the board and the game is quite pleasant. Probably wouldn't think of it as favourably without the "Cosmic Ashtray" (if they decided to just use a bag instead). It's amazing how that piece of plastic adds to the thrill of the game! A lighter game due to the heavy luck factor, but intriguing enough with its quirky trading system and bet hedging.  Dated now, but just enough cuteness in it to keep it around.  All around, this is a cool game from Alan Moon!

The game is too random, but I just like the Cosmic Ashtray of Doom!

Because of the randomness, I'd probably play it about once a year.

Let's have a SPACE RAFFLE!!!  Lots of chance, enough that the game can be won or lost over a lucky draw.  However, it plays fairly quickly, the trading is clever, and the risks add a lot of excitement.  Medium-light in depth but a lot of fun.  A very unique game that I need to get to the table more often.

Oh Cosmic Ashtray, the jury is out on you.  I like the overall mechanics of the game, and I like the theme, but the game seemed to drag, and I really didn't feel like I had any hope of winning later on in the game.  I will give you another try.

The artwork on the board is really quite nice, although it is hard to tell from the pictures here on the Geek.

Update: Well Cosmic Ashtray, I gave ya another go, and you know what?  You're ok in my book.  With 5 players, the game can still go on a little bit too long, but it's still a fun ride.

RATING: 5
a game of converting sets of cards into majorities on the board. Not terrible, and kind of fun with an element of probability and push your luck. The down side is that there is really mostly one way to play. Get technologies early then expand fast. It is possible to move away from this of course but it would be difficult.

Too much luck for my tastes.  There's a serious issue with falling further behind, since you can get a bad hand, not get involved in the trading, not be able to spend cards, so get stuck with the same hand again.  It's an ok game, it's just not for me.

The trading part is very nice, and you have a fine number of choices in the action phase. However, when you try to establish an economic center - the main source of victory points - you have to rely on luck. If you fail, you have wasted your cards and it may take a while before you can try again. Some people may enjoy moving the odd device around, but for me it's just a randomizer, simpler but not much better than rolling dice and using the number of each players' pieces as modifiers. The game may work for families with children, but the excessive randomness ruins the system for serious gamers.

RATING: 6
I first played this on Feb 21st 2007.  Reading the instructions can seem overwhelming.  I had to re-read some sections a few times before I understood what I was suppose to be doing.  In fact the instructions seemed so overwhelming that it took me weeks to find the courage to explain it to someone or perhaps it took that long to sucker people into playing it.  Either way, it did in fact take a long time to explain the rules and get underway.  Not to mention that the rules had to be referenced several times.  Still, this was a fun and interesting game.  It probably takes a game play or two to get some kind of strategy down as well.  It did have plenty of options and strategy as well.  There is a bit of luck in cards drawn and which planets you draw to have extra stations placed as well.  Overall, I'd recommend giving it a game play if you like a lot of options and don't mind reading or explaing all of these options.  The second game play should be a lot more enjoyable.

RATING: 5
An extremely luck-based game about colonizing satellites. The basic mechanism of the game is set collection; you're required to have at least a set of 3 cards in order to do something. The most exciting of which is establishing a satellite using the cosmic hockey puck.

Unfortunately there is almost no control in this game. You can swing the odds in your favor, but there's a possibility you'll lose EVERY single time. And this became very frustrating for some players. I would go so far as to say that winning this game takes no skill (even after winning a game myself). Also, the start player getting 3 actions made no sense, since it meant some players got more actions than others.

Well, the ashtray was interesting.  Too bad our game took over 2 hours: pretty random for 2 hours, with it being a disadvantage to try and gets lots of 'spacestations' on a planet, as you were more likely to be kicked off.  I wonder why they did not give different card backs to the three different types of cards?  I could be convinced to try again, but not with lots of enthusiasm.  It seemed a disadvantage not to spend all your cards in a turn, so building up for the future seemed a bad idea.  I'm not sure what exactly it was that did not 'click', but it sure was a bit flat for me.  But, I am glad to have tried, because it was always on my 'maybe' list!

I compare this one to Parker Brothers' The Magnificent Race.  Both games have a cool little color selection mechanic that favors whatever color is most plentiful.  The spinner in Magificent Race is neater but the set collection and action phase make Andromeda the more  strategic game.

Joué à 5 joueurs.
Un jeu simple ou l'on doit conquérir des planètes. On collectionne des sets de cartes pour envoyer des cubes, qui nous permettent grâce a une petite boite d'extraire des cubes pour poser sur les satellites. Une part de hasard, de chance et d’interaction.
Partie très intéressante pour ce jeu méconnu.

RATING: 6
In this space themed game, use collected sets of cards to put colonists on planets, advance on technology or colonize a base on the planet. The last action involves putting all colored cubes (representing colonists) into a hollow puck, shuffling, then if the first cube coming out of the hole in the puck is yours, you get to colonize the base for VPs. When this game first came out, it looked like a cool strategy game. Then when people started pulling tokens out of the puck, we realized what kind of game it was. Some interesting ideas, if there were less luck involved, could be a better game as the only way to be successful in the game is to take continual pulls from the puck.

My brain says no, but my heart says yes.  Really not that great of a game.  However, it is so much fun with 4-5 players (most games I prefer 3).  The trading phase can make or break a hand, and there is something about that shaker that keeps me wanting more.

RATING: 6
There's not a lot going on here in terms of deep strategy. Basically get your cards, hope you get sets of the same colour, hope the trading phase helps you get sets, and then spend the sets on a simple tech tree (eg bigger hand size) or shake the puck on the planet depicted on your set and hope one of your cubes comes out as that'll earn your VP's. When I first started playing, my strategy was to assiduously build up my hand size. Gradually I’ve come round to a strategy of "ping at all times", even if you have only 1 shot, especially in the start game when all those lovely high scoring satellites are available. I’ve also trained all the blue pieces to want to come home to papa. You can hear them squealing to be free from the cosmic puck of destiny and they shoulder the other colours aside. This complements nicely my "ping at all times" strategy! It’s fun in a fresh random groan type of way, but it’s a game that will only come out occasionally, when the brains are fried, little decision is required, and you can blame all on the puck. And then it provides a refreshing change from other light affairs due to that puck.

I love the mechanics on this one.  Cool bidding system to make set collection to lead to area control.

Yet it's not too complicated.  It does force one to make tough decisions. It plays 3 well. Sliiiiight luck factor, which I don't mind, using the station maker. Luck can be mitigated by maximizing your pieces on the planet. And then trying to get them back to Earth (or elsewhere) for final scoring.

I like the uniqueness of the station decider. The art and components are excellent.  

Whats not to like here?

Played with 5-changes it a bit. Would like to try 4. So far, I prefered 3 over 5. A little more control.  

4 is the best # here. Then 3. 5, I feel is not good.

Space colonization game. Has a really interesting trading phase where the start player offers one card at a time and the other players offer one card each in return. Then everyone takes another player's offering or keeps his own cards. Also has the "cosmic ashtray" for determining which player's cube is chosen to colonize a planet.

I suspect that this game is not rated higher because many people see the cosmic hockey puck as a gimmick. I think that it works well as a mechanic in a good light game.  A friend of mine dismissed this as a kids game but its no more so than say TTR.  So far in the games I have played, teching up doesn't seem to bring the necessary benefits to outscore those who concentrate on scoring the planets.

I had some fun playing this one.  But, after one play it just seems like attempting to make an economic center is by far the best move.  Doing anything else almost seems like a wasted action.

I played a 3-player game not too long ago.  Some fun was had, and I'd like to play it again.  It's different that other games in some ways.. I can't help but think that the space puck is nothing more than a gimmick, but hey, it works... Only problem is, I feel pretty certain that the clear value spread on some of the planets takes away a lot of strategy, while the space puck trivializes the conquest.

Update:  My rating now represents my desire to play.  When compared with other games in my collection, Andromeda is rarely considered or recommended.  The game is really light, very heavy on luck (cards and cosmic puck), and ultimately - there are other games I'd rather play in the timespan it takes to play Andromeda.  With that said, I give this game an extra .5 on account of the fact that in recent days I'd like to play it again and try to renew my interest in this title.

This game is a lot of fun and has  some interesting game play and strategy.  The trading phase is excellent and I like the hockey puck thing.  The amount of luck involved from using the hockey puck is not that great really .. based on your play you can control the level risk.  Is also a great family game once everyone understands the rules.  Funny experience was when my 10 yr old son's eyes were glazing over as I read the rules and he told me I was out of my mind, but once we played he loved it!

One three-player game. A lot fo fun with not too much randomness as players can control the probabilities of success to a great degree. The game seemed to end too soon and perhaps it should be extended to: number of complete systems = players + 1. Also, the transport cards alomost certainly need to be saved to transport useless cubes back to Earth from completed systems near the end of the game. Next game I'm going to add a VP track to keep all players on an equal footing as to position in the game. I expect the rating may well go up to an 8.

Great game.  Fairly light, but fun.  I thought the cosmic ash tray would be a silly gimmick and it is, but that does not detract from the fun of this game.  Having played this game with 5 players I didn't have as much fun.  I would rate the 3 player game an 8 for light fun cosmic-planet-ring-of-death fun.  In the five player game I didn't feel like I had any control at all.

The components are beautiful.  But I would have made the planets those from our solar system and the resources more science fictiony.

RATING: 6
Rated after two plays. Sort of a cross between Ticket to Ride and El Grande... but only sort of. An interesting trading system and the famous "cosmic ashtray" make this game stand out from the crowd. But luck is a huge factor in this game. A single random event can increase a player's score by as much as 25% of the final result: be warned. By contrast, Ticket to Ride (by the same designer) avoids this problem by keeping the turns short and snappy and the decisions quick: the right amount of thought for a similarly luck-driven game. Andromeda is an okay game and I'd play it again if that's what the group wants to do, but there are many games I'd rather play instead.

Random elements - yes.  Fun - definitely.  I can see some early inspiration for Ticket to Ride here.  The hockey puck creates a bit of randomness in the game (although you can influence the random element to increase your chances for success), but also excitement as well.  When you buck the odds and still establish a base, you can't help but cheer.

RATING: 6
An unusual combination of area majority, trading, and luck from Alan R. Moon. The odds are against you from the start unless you trade and transport shrewdly. The production quality is high, with a huge (Tikal-sized) board in full colour, heaps of wooden cubes (it's a Euro, after all), and the charming cosmic ashtray. The space theme is really refreshing after the one thousandth Eurogame about Venetian traders. Both the ashtray and the trading mechanism are (to my knowledge) unique in the world of gaming.

The only problem I can find with Andromeda is the endgame. The game can end suddenly (at the whim of the ashtray, really), and it would be better if it were more predictable so that the players could plan for it. Something like the Traders of Genoa turn track would be ideal. There's a variant on the game page where play continues until all  planets are claimed, but I suspect the game would overstay its welcome at that length if you had more than three players. As with most area control games, it's best with three.

Update: dropped it to a 6 after playing a few games sober. You need to be a bit tipsy and laughy and shouty to get the most out of the ashtray. Perhaps needs some rule tweaks to work sober, though I'm not sure where to begin. All this go playing has made me too analytical to enjoy longer light games.

Update II: tried it with Bohnanza style trading and the game was shorter and better. I'd rate it a 7 with that variant.

All that careful planning and strategy ruined by the big luck of the draw. This might not annoy me so much were it a quick game, but it annoys me more because it isn't a quick game.

Rio Grande English edition. The game is solidly produced but the art is just very dated.

Update:A fun silly game that features trading, taking actions and area control. Plus that Cosmic Ashtray!

Each turn, players use planet cards to trade for sets which allows them to move cubes around the board and try to use the ashtray to determine if they can score point for a planet. The game zips along very quickly and there are interesting decisions to be made (trading, taking chances with the ashtray, etc).There's also two technology trees to upgrade various aspects of a player's capabilities. 

It's light, fun and not to be taken seriously. The luck can be controlled with good trading and careful placement of cubes. Scales well with 3 to 5.

Like many of Alan Moon's games min/maxing can really drag the game down.  Overall this should be a quick light game that should be played from gut instinct rather that deep analysis.  Light and fun card management game with many different options.  As far as theme is concerned this game really has nothing to do with space exploration, but then again what do you expect.  My only real problem with the game is that, while I enjoyed it enough playing it at the time, I've never really been compelled to play it again.

RATING: 6
Simple game of set collection and area majority, but with a somewhat significant random element. Would like to try it again, but the first play seemed too luck-dependent. Of course, it took about 2 hours -- might be OK if the game actually plays in 1 hour!

--- Summary ---
Setup: 9 cards/player. Place 1 cube per planet per player, plus additional cube per planet matching cards dealt out; remaining cubes on earth. Each gets 2 special action cards.

Each round: First, players may play a single special action card, in order. Then, Trade Step. Finally, Action Step.

Trade Step: Start player first plays cards (2-3) to offer, one at a time; other players simultaneously show cards to trade, different than offered. Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out. Clockwise from Start Player, next player with cards still in front of them either makes a trade or takes their cards back. Continue till 0-1 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand.

Action Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:
- discard 2 cards, then draw 2
- turn in set of 3-7 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet
- turn in set of 3-7 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over. If other player's cube, send it back to earth.
- Sets: if no wilds ("pure"), take appropriate bonus wild card matching the size of the set (if available); wilds can be used later as parts of sets

Then rotate starting player to the left. Game ends when all stations on 3 planets have been taken. Score VP shown on board (for Tech level, stations occupied, and cubes on earth). Most VP wins.

This is a nice family game and a typical Alan Moon offering. Like with Union Pacific and Ticket to Ride, there's the eternal dilemma between scoring certain points now or investing in the possibility to score huge later on. And the galactic ashtray is one of the nicest random generators I've seen in a game, easily beating Wallanstein's cube tower.

With one play under my belt, the only thing I haven't yet been able to figure out is what exactly is an "Andromeda".  That little mystery aside, this is an easy to learn, highly interactive, clever game with a unique gimmick.  A very solid game, overall.  The two main mechanisms, the card trading and the establishing of colonies on the moons, are both clever and fun.  The gimmick of course is the Cosmic Hockey Puck, which is a neat little randomizer that adds enjoyment and tension to the game.  Other than this little device, all other components are basic and functional.  The artwork on the game board is downright gorgeous, and the cards all show 5 images of the same planet (in case you can't figure out which one the other 4 represent, presumably).  Due to the level of interaction I probably wouldn't want to play this game with fewer than 4 players (with the max of 5 being ideal), but the combination of simplicity and strategy make this an approachable game for newer gamers and more experienced gamers alike.  After just one play, I've definitely gotten my $3's worth from this thrift shop find!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10

The cosmic puck shaking is amazing, but the game probably will fade after some play. Nice also commercial phase, trying to offer something of interesting to obtain good cards from opponents. Luck factors presents, but funny.
---UPDATE---
Played in three playes gain interest for fast play. Raised.

This is a fun space exploration game with a card set-collection mechanism with trading.  It also features the Cosmic Hockey Puck that leaves a trail of little cubes in its wake.  How can you not like that?

Interesting area-control game with some unique mechanics and a "cosmic ashtray." Nice game that too often seems to get overlooked.

RATING: 6
There is far too much luck in the game. The gameplay is okay, the 'ashtray' is enjoyable. However, it can be frustrating not drawing/trading the cards you need & never getting your 'stations' out from the ashtray regardless of how well the probability is for you.

I like games that do things a little differently.  The use of the "ash tray" to randomize the odds is neat.  I like this game more than most I've played it with.

A decent space-themed games.  We love space games in our home (more than normal people do), and this one is pretty good.  The hockey puck of the cosmos is the best part (gotta play it to understand).

I like SF themed games, this one works pretty well, I like the cosmic ashtray random generator, the cards work very well - I especially like the mechanic of forced trading of cards which I'm surprised doesn't get used more often.  Maybe too much randomness for some tastes, but I wish this would come out more often. Nice bits. Got a chance to play a few more games of this, and am really liking it. Have played off and on quite a lot, some players really like it, it's become somewhat of a regular, comes back from time to time.

Great game if you can accept the high luck factor. Typically a game that you play as a filler, although the game's length (1-2 hours with four players) might suggest otherwise. Its main strengths are that there is very little downtime and a lot of player interaction. Its main weakness probably that most of the available options each turn tend to be ignored: It is really all about shaking the colony dispenser as often as you can. In order to be able to do this, however, you still need to be a clever trader.

Didn't enjoy my 2nd play quite as much.  Seems like it might be excessively random, and that there was a huge 1st player advantage; need to try a 3rd or 4th time to really say for sure.

With the original rules, this is about the worst game I've played.  The gameplay was anti-climatic, and it felt like we were missing one important rule the whole time.  Very unbalanced.

On the plus side, the manufacturing quality is great, and the "ashtray" idea is really fantastic.

Interesting combination of mechanics with a "non-Euro" theme - I like that!!!  It took a turn or two to understand the phases and the player aids were helpful where the rules seemed a bit off.  Set collection, trading and some area majority combined into one package.  Enjoyed my 2nd play as much as the first.  Not a "classic top 100 BGG game", but a solid contributor.  Thanks Mr. Moon!

ehhh... quite a bit of luck here. Id play it again if everyone really wanted to. I don't get the whole ashtray combat thing... can't you just pick them out of a bag or something? Still... I've played much worse.

RATING: 5
This is a weird sort of area control game, with a ridiculously random method for determining who gets majorities.  The collection mechanism for upgrading technologies and hand size give the game something that elevates it above the random hockey puck, and there are ways to minimize the randomness, but frustrating things are still likely to happen in the game.  Still, it's unique enough that I likely wouldn't turn down a game, unless someone were to suggest Taj Mahal or Princes of Florence.  Or Goa.  Or Age of Steam.

Good and enjoyable game with the so called 'intergalactical ashtray'. First the trade, after it a decision how to gather points by either occupying sattelites, move your stations or by completing missions. Balanced game, easy to learn, nice to play.

Something about this just clicked for me. Not sure if it's the gimmick about drawing cubes, or whether it's just the fun of making the card offers. Or, of course, a combination of the two.

I think that this is a fun game that I expect to play with my family a fair amount over the years. The cosmic hockey puck and the resulting luck factor is fun, and the randomness just doesn't bother me.  You've got to make some decent strategic moves, but the luck factor stops anyone from taking anything too seriously (or taking too much time making decisions).

Can't believe it took us so long to finally play this game.  I just about tore my hair out trying to explain the rules to the 3 adults I was playing with (my husband included), not because the rules were bad, but because they were a bunch of goofballs.  Fortunately, they liked the game and so did I.  We liked the amount of luck involved and it played nicely with 4.  A keeper.  But next time, I'm not going to be the one to explain the rules.

Played a few times (with 4 or 5 players). An interesting game with two very nice ideas: the "pseudo-majority" and the trading system. The randomness in the selection can be a problem, especially as the game feels a bit too short to balance luck out.

variant rules to try:
1: a player can move a station from earth to a planet with only 2 cards.
2a: when opponent station comes out of the space puck, player must put in into a satellite of his choice or use up one attempt for sending it back to earth 
2b: there's room for two economic centers per satellite, points for satellite are divided
3: attempts may be divided between "send station to planet" and "try to establish a econ. center"
4: all players have 3 actions (boosts up the usability of larger space ship)

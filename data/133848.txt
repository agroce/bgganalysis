First game with four and I graded it 6.5, but with lots of though about it afterwards. A retry with six and it's really shinning. The full six people limited choices in the game, and while it on the other hand opened up more opportunities than a game with lesser numbers.

LIKE: nice bumping mechanism, great artwork. you can keep bumping yourself to get repeated placements.
DISLIKE: the board is busy and overwhelming first time through. Some randomness when your workers roll too high.

OVERALL: it's a race/resource game, but it lacked a big punch. not sure why. maybe due to limited paths to victory?

Many nice things to say about this game - and can only agree that the components are marvelous and add to the enjoyment. It feels different from other worker placement games. For example, I very much enjoy the rolling to determine if you lose workers or not. It obviously curtails getting too many. And it adds to pulling off workers - do you pull them all and risk a large number or pull a few and ensure continued use? The beginning recruits really determine much of how you play - and getting different allegiances is (apparently) important. There however is luck in two significant ways: rolling doubles (which allows extra turns) and drawing artifacts (as two matching are as good as any three) - either may leave a feeling of unfairness. It can also become clear concerning the winner well before the game leaves the table - as you can at best only place 1 star on the board per turn. Still, an enjoyable game that should see a few more plays yet.

Ohhh I want to like this game so much. There's a lot there that is very intriguing but everytime I look at the board or think about the theme I cringe. I would like to play again now that the learning curve is out of the way.

RATING: 5
It seems like the core mechanic of this game (the dice workers) are completely superfluous to the game. Alien Frontiers never really punishes you for getting a bad roll, it just leaves not being able to do exactly what you want whereby this actively seems to punish unlucky rolls. It just feels like if you had non-random workers this would be a better game even though it would remove some of the game. Doubt I will ever play this again.

A great worker placement / resource management game. But the game is so much more than that. You can really feel that you are playing in a dystopian society where you keep your workers stupid and happy and do not want them to escape. Honestly one of my favorite games of all time and it hits the table quite often.

First Edition

First play was very underwhelming for my group, we just didn't feel all the love that's coming for this. Maybe worker placement isn't out thing. I mean, I enjoyed it somewhat, but like 4 others all suggested I trade it away after the first play, so I guess it's gotta go since it won't get played again...

Traded!

In one word, "unnecessary". Does what other worker placements do, only a bit worse. Great production quality but the experience is sub-par. Convoluted board, unnecessarily complicated rules, theme almost makes no sense. Most of the time, you don't know why you are doing what you are doing. Big disappointment.

Abstract:
An innovative worker placement game that introduces worker bumping: players cannot block certain spots with their workers. A bumped worker is returned with a reward instead. The game also uses different (intelligent) types of worker.

Thoughts: 
I really like the unusual, dystopian theme. I also like different types of worker. I do not like how dice rolling is implemented in this game - I think it does not matter over the course of the game, however, it still feels luck-prone.

Good dice Game, but for me i feel all time during The Game He plays like a race game. You run to build, you run to complete The tunnels and finally you still running to put your last Stars in The favors of The Cities.

1st play: interesting dice worker placement but not best with 2, the player count I played at. The workers can bump each other, which is a new take on the genre, and the theme is unique. I also like how they balanced the "get more workers" strategy here. How this scores depends on how it goes with 4.

No 2nd play: Apparently the game isn't that exciting to me, because I have had plenty of chances to pick it and haven't. There were some neat mechanics with the way that workers can bump each other or get too smart and run away, but not enough to pick again.

WOW!!! Now, the details:

The second-best worker-placement game I have ever played after Carson City, and it gives Carson City a run for the money. It feels unlike any other worker-placement game out there, even Alien Frontiers, with which it shares the "dice as workers" mechanic. Remarkably well-themed, and I've spent a lot of time thinking about how it could be re-themed, and haven't come up with a perfect scenario: too many mechanics would have to be changed for a re-theme. 

Unlike so many other worker-placement games, Euphoria has no "hey! you took my spot!" feature. Workers can easily be booted out, often with delicious consequences. Although there are occasionally tactical elements (especially with the "when to boot" decision), Euphoria is overwhelmingly a strategic game, and a pretty scary one at that! Remember: it pays to be stupid! Knowledge equals unhappiness. 

There is a strong element of uncertainty which prevents players from ever feeling confident about their chosen strategy. And with such a large number of recruits and markets absent from any given game of Euphoria, replayability is very much a sure thing.

My only complaint is the rulebook. Everything is there and it's all quite clear; but a lack of context leaves one saying, "OK: I now understand how this works. But why is it important?" A more thematic explanation, I think, might have made it better.

My initial rating is a 9; but I think it's going to go up!

Wanting to play this game very bad. 
It looks amazing, and having the Kickstarter version (bought 2nd hand) I love the pieces, the gold feels solid.

Finally I was able to play.
The game looked so daunting, but after set up and reading the rules the game turned out to be simple to play. It was an instant hit, so much happening so much to do, and the buildings added a layer of fun and surprise as no one knew what would happen till it was flipped over. 

Will be playing this again.

Euphoria is reasonably interesting at a glance, but I'm not sure it actually works. It seems like all the games I've played have been decided less than halfway through by the initial faction pulls and starting abilities. The dice don't give you very many good options, and things begin to drag on.

There are some neat ideas and resource manipulation in it. But I thought there was too much 'going through the motions' to end the game.

Interesting worker placement. I like some of the concepts - managing your workers intelligence (die pips) is interesting, and I like how that plays in the main resource farms. I think the ability to 'bump' other workers isn't my favorite mechanic - it sort of removes some of the crucial decision making from a worker placement.

I love this. I love that there's no frustration related to not being about to place your workers, only a building sense of urgency to spread your influence and get your authority tokens on the board.

It's not for everybody. It can be quite confusing for a novice gamer there's so many options!) and I recommend using the grey scale side of the board for people who haven't played before.

There is much to like in this game including excellent art, components, and an original theme.  The theme felt fresh and interesting when explained.  Upon first examining the board, and looking over the components, I actually felt a strong desire to really dive into the theme and experience a dystopia built from the hands and minds of the players.  

Yet, perhaps I was setting my sights and feelings too high.  The building of the dystopia in the game fell a little flat for me thematically.  I felt more like I was going through the same old euro gaming motions, creating a distance between myself and the theme.  

On the other hand, the standard euro gaming motions were certainly nicely designed and illustrated, so one could do a lot worse than this game if you are in the mood for a dice-based worker placement game.  And I suppose if the mechanics and the theme were tightened up too much, actual dystopic feelings might arise, and do we really want to spend game time experiencing dystopic feelings?!  Maybe not after all.  Better to have fun.

Theme pretty weak in this game and is barely there; it does nothing to give context to the mechanics. Interesting worker placement game that has a bit of a push your luck element to it. Some interesting choices when both placing workers and deciding which ones to take back and when as it can impact both yours and your opponent's future actions. Incredibly mechanical game that isn't very intuitive. "Ethical dilemma" cards are a joke as they're all identical and just require a different artifact card to be discarded (or any two) but all have an identical effects that really don't offer an interesting choice. Very nice artwork. The game just wasn't worth hanging on to though so we ended up trading it away.

This worker placement game deserves to be much higher than 242 on the BGG list. At least top 100. It is innovative and easy to play. Yes, you look at that board and think "Wow! That looks busy!" But it isn't. The game play is relatively simple but with enough strategy that you cannot just blunder through it and hope to win. The worker placement is different in that you can bump other people's workers and take that spot, though in doing so you give them back a worker to place on their turn. Euphoria is filled with other neat mechanisms like the morale & intelligence tracks and being able to gain allegiances with factions on the board . This is a great game and everyone ought to check it out so it can be higher as it deserves.

One of my all time favorite games. The use of recruit cards that have special powers add an extreme amount of replayability. Each game you have a combination of two, and they greatly influence your strategy so there is no dominant way to win the game. Your path to victory will be different each game. I also really love how you play until someone wins outright, not for a fixed period and then count up points. This adds so much more tension to the game. Add these great concepts to a very strong dice-worker placement foundation and you get one hell of a great game.

Really interesting and elegant worker placement game, and you cannot beat the theme or the colorful production values Stonemaier put into this. Roll and place dice, bump dice back off the board, and collect 10 tokens on either board spaces or cards, rather than a generic Victory track. But it's how the theme is integrated into each area of the board, each area of the conflicting societies in this dystopian civilization which makes it great, plus the hidden character cards you can reveal. Love these dice, pretty sexy. Great game.

A solid worker placer. Suffers from the same problem a lot of middle weight wp games do - competition for places isn't especially tight, and emphasis is a little too heavily on shuffling resources around rather than developing a secondary system. It ranks ahead of Alien Frontiers, but isn't economic enough or cut-throat enough to be exciting.

Interesting, the most memorable part of the game is the theme. It's mostly generic and derivative of older dystopian works, yet I feel that it has enough charm and character to feel more thematic than more euros or even the standard generic fantasy Ameritrash games.

solid worker placement game with an interesting dystopia theme. Artwork is family friendly and vibrant, not 100% my style but it works. The game does a good job of being relatively simple with enough complexity to make play enjoyable once you figure out the legends and pathways to resources.

Great execution of the workers as dice mechanic, using rolls to check your workers knowledge against their willingness to keep working for you. Also allows players to bump each other as a way to access desirable spaces at the cost of saving a foe from having to pay to recall their workers.

Recruit card abilities or powers seem to range from decent/ok to pretty useless so some combinations of faction abilities could seem op. But most of the time their powers or abilities could use a boost.

Still a fun worker placement game that provides variety and enjoyment for 2-6 players. I don't own euphoria and will likely play it enough with our local group to avoid purchasing it but I wouldn't be mad about having it in my collection.

The kickstarter edition looks awesome.  Pieces are just terrific.  For me, the board shows all the info (quite a lot) in a not very easy way, so quite unconfortable to play.  Specially, there are some important texts that are just impossible to read, and players tend to forget.
The game is a take this to change it for that so that it allows you to put yourself in a position to score 1 point (put one of your stars).  Put 10 to win.  But quite unclear to me.

Euphoria is part classic worker placement euro, part innovative design.

The classic part is you place workers to obtain resources, convert these in better resources (or more workers), then into a star. After ten stars, you win.

The innovative part lies mainly in theme and its integration in gameplay: the backstory has some kind of sense, and many of the actions are integrated inside the theme and make it shine. The knowledge that brings workers to quit is quite ingenious, even if it brings a heavy dose of luck inside the game: higher rolls make you lose a worker, doubles or triples are insanely good...

Another (unusual for a eurogame) source of potential luck lies in the market tiles distribution: some are more "fit" for particular areas…

The third and most problematic source of luck is the recruit choice, done contemporarily at the beginning of the game: since the advancement in the faction tracks obviously favors players with the same faction recruits, being alone with a recruit of a faction seems very penalizing.

Anyway, Euphoria is a decent game, and it would probably have been great with a proper refined development.

Like how everything just links together. For those who have not played this game, it does look a little daunting but after a few rounds of dice rolling, things gets easier and you understand the process even better.

The theme is also very nice. Plus since this is the Supreme edition of the Kickstarter campaign, the resources are upgraded. I like the feel of the clay, stone and gold.

I had high expectations for this one. But it fell rather flat after my first play.
Don't get me wrong, it's a solid game, but there are just a few things/mechanisms that I don't like that much:
* Too many cards/tiles that change rules/give special effects (I don't like the aspect of keeping track of too many of those)
* The blind card draw and faction association - if you're the only one who sided with a faction you have bet on the losing horse (which you couldn't know)
* In our 6-player game we had 2 people who got locked out of doing anything with green faction (arguably the late game faction) - this might be a very unfortunate constellation of monuments but it left a sour taste

However, there are positive things as well:
* I liked the dice as workers with intelligence - the smarter your workers (sum of all pips), the more likely one runs off (you lose the die)
* Some actions can't be blocked, instead your worker returns to your hand if another person uses the action
* Components are good and the design is appealing (although maybe a bit overwhelming/confusing at times)

Better than I thought it was going to be. Should not be advertised as any less than a 4-player game, possibly 5. The game really doesn't work with 3.

The effects of the random tiles and cards are very swingy, and caused our game to lock up. Which also wasn't cool.

Played with 5 or 6, and ignoring special abilities on cards and tiles, I would play this again. Otherwise, no.

The more I play this game, the less I like it; I feel sometimes like it's almost impossible to stop players accumulating points at more or less the same rate as each other, most of the time... an opinion that wasn't dispelled when the creator mentioned that stats from online play show the average points difference between 1st and 2nd place to be 1. The game really revolves around building the markets and not being left out of them, but allowing players to buy into previously-built markets dilutes that element significantly.

First Play: components are of an awesome quality. The bar has been raised high here. However its downhill after that. I admit that dice rolling games rarely score highly for me but its a bad sign where the dice are the least offensive aspect of a game. Here the randomness of the cards utterly unbalances applied skill. The initial selection of 'agents' will be massively assisted if another player picks the same as you.   The artefacts can fall in your lap giving you doubles or exactly what you want....or they don't. Need a specific artefact for your card or to let you build in a construction? You'll need luck to do this efficiently, likewise the turn of the constructions result in some harsh or soft pay back for the non contributor. There is no way to tell until its flipped. The differences will make a huge effect on your game but you have no control over them or means to predict or check what they might be. Throughout there are random moments where gambles pay off or fail, not to mention that you need to roll low numbers when the dice are involved. 

I really don't care too much about theme and its just as well with Euphoria. I didn't understand the back story and the game play is just a series of worker placements in abstract zones on the board, gaining abstract materials and artefacts with pictures of teddy bears and baseball bats (???) and placing even more abstract stars for no tangible reason apart from the fact that placing 10 stars will win you the game. Perhaps this strangeness is the point, whatever the point, it was lost on me.

If you like this sort of luck fuelled experience then go for it, but I never want to play this again. 

4/10 rating because of the great bits.

The theme in this one is great, but there's just enough randomness (either in artifact card draw or rolling dice for workers) to keep it out of the upper echelon. Why roll workers? Why not just have them get smarter over time? There's a fix in there somewhere.

Really intriguing, but intimidating, Euro all about bringing down the lies and hypocrisies of the dystopia you live in. The theme is integrated well, but your choices are so diverse and plentiful that you find the thematic details less appealing than the intricate puzzle the game gives you to challenge your brain with. There are multiple paths to victory, and you'll find yourself more often diversifying between them as opposed to choosing one in particular. This dynamic nature of the strategy, plus the good/poor luck provided by rolling the dice, make this game a brain burning bit of great fun.

This is one of two dice placement games that I own. The other being operation kindergarten. I love Euphoria. The theme and art work are great! The game play is fun. You have to talk through what your actions are doing in the game because it causes the theme to sink in. This could be played like a stark number crunching Euro, but it works best when you appreciate the theme because it is there and I enjoyed it greatly. Soooo much better than alien frontiers...

when we play this some people were rumbling about the balance of the engineer cards.and from the comments i see that the designer will rebalance the cards.so they were right.as for me when a played this i looked for some thematical sense and i couldnt find it.the whole game was so much wierd to me.there can be a issue with the rolls and morale mechanic.also we almost dont open any new buildings at full player count.which was wierd also.

my impressions.it is a very very wierd game.at least for me.

RATING: 5.9
First impressions: some clever things going on with the dice. It makes me almost think, the designer took Castles of Burgundy and made it his style. More thematic, more fun, and pushed the dice worker placement aspect a little more, with some clever things that you have to take into account based on your dice rolls. I very much enjoyed my first game. I blame Rahdo for making us buy the Treasure tokens set. The wooden components included are very nice but boy did I want those gold bars after watching Rahdo playing around with them for an hour. Initial rating of 8 may rise. Right now I prefer Viticulture and Scythe but those two are in my top ten so that is a crazy high bar to match in my view. I enjoy Euphoria enough that I now have to consider Mr Stegmaier one of my favourite designers. The theme is a bit nutty but the game does not take itself too seriously and I found it fun to play.

Firstly - very good production values. Art style, wooden meeples/resources, and custom dice all add to the experience. Playing is very enjoyable, and there is a good variety in the number and type of strategies one can employ to chase victory. Would recommend.

I really, really wanted to like this one.  I will definitely play it again to confirm/deny my initial rating, but I found an unconvincing marriage between the theme and the mechanisms of play.  The theme was very well done, but the game play did not immerse me in the theme.  I just felt like I was getting resources and trading for others to be the first to place a star somewhere.  That being said, I don't know that I could do the theme any better for my, but I prefer Bioshock Infinite's game play more, because I feel more a part of the story when playing.

You won’t fool me again, Euphoria!

But all the fault is mine, I guess: I should have known better. I had to expect that your beautiful cover art and appealing theme were made just to lure new players into your tempting coils and have nothing to do with the real gameplay!
And so it was indeed: as soon as I joined it, Euphoria turned out as an uninspired downer that at first makes you regret joining it and then constantly revels in burdening you.

Anyhow, I was surprised by the level of luck involved, for an euro: you really can win or lose a game even before the real game starts, as almost everything hangs on the specialists you choose at the start and the faction they belong to. As a matter of fact, sharing the same faction as another player greatly improves the involved players’ chances at success.
To say nothing of the dice rolling, which is both Euphoria’s best feature (as it adds a hint of randomness) and worst rule (as it bullies the players who unlocked their fourth die) at the same time.

By the way: the cog-dice are such a beauty!

I found it really funny that the guy that designed Viticulture (a game that is REALLY "tight" (if you do not include the Grande workers)) made this game which you can pretty much just do what you want.  I don't know if the game was "tight" enough to be super interesting, but it does not over stay its welcome.

Seemed like the designer was trying to make a dice worker placement game for people that don't like rolling dice, and in doing so created a game that will be forgotten behind Kingsburg and Alien Frontiers IMHO.

There's a lot going on in this game and a lot of interesting mechanics. The theme shown through well in a couple spots and not so well in others, but that could be because I was trying to figure out how the game went. I liked the trade off of the hope and brains of the workers for controlling hand limit and number of dice. The different bands in the resources were interesting. Overall I enjoyed the game but wasn't blown away by it.

uhh - this one looked so good, but it really is such a stupid game! You can win by a mile using only two spots with the green faction - unless another player has green and gets to go before you. I am not willing to look up someone's house rules just to make a game actually balanced. I really do not understand how this got the green light for release as Jamie's other designs are REALLY great.

2013. kickstarter. dice, wkr pl, set coll, hand mgt. similar to Alien Frontiers. An interesting economic and race game involving set collection and pick-up-and-deliver.  The goal is to be the first player to build all 10 of your achievement tokens.  There is a lot of luck in die rolls and artifact card draws, but you can mitigate some of the luck with skillful play of your workers on certain action spaces of the board.  I like that you can bump other players regardless of the value of your die... but bumping shouldn't be taken lightly since it essentially gives the bumped player a free action because he would normally have to pay to get his worker (die) back from the board.

I dislike that random draws of artifact cards have such a big impact on the game and it's not easy/cheap to obtain artifact cards (and that you often need one or two specific artifacts but there are ~12 different artifacts repeated in the artifact deck).  Maybe I need to build a better engine and cycle through those artifact cards or use them in different ways.

RATING: 10
The single best worker placement game I've played. This game solved all but one of my complaints about worker placement games without losing any of their appeal.

Dice fly around constantly affecting the game but not in the way most games use them so that high rolls aren't necessarily better than low ones, just different. Players heavily interact with one another preventing the game from feeling mostly like a solo game that happens to have 4 other people competing for points at the end. There isn't even a single "must-have" spot on the board that needs to be limited to a single user and even if someone is squatting on a space you need, you can always bump them from your space although it helps them slightly. The game scoring is set up such that everyone is almost always within 2 points of finishing by the end of the game so even though those two points might take you as much as 6 turns, people don't usually *feel* like they got stomped at the end.

The only complaints I have about it is that when using 3 players, the recruits unbalance the game significantly because there is a good chance that one player will be trying to build up a faction all alone, which is a major hit to their productivity even if the recruit powers themselves are usually pretty minor and well balanced. The game also gets longer as you add more players.

Introduced to the game in a 6-player slugfest. For the first-timer, it was definitely overwhelming with 6 players. The winner did nothing but go to the Icarites EVERY turn of the game and blew everyone out of the water, so I'm totally lost on the strategy of the game. First experience was okay I guess, finished 3rd of 6, but felt much of the game that people were just reaching here and there and everywhere - very chaotic.

Great simple worker placement game!

A busy board that actually it's pretty straighforward to follow, once you get used to where things are found.
The artwork is colourful and very well put together. Components wise I'm impressed.

There's a lot of interactivy between players and about that there is a relevant twist, where you actions can give other players the victory! So your actions do count on other players future moves.

The theme is interesting, since it's a clear critique to our today's society/world.

Quick and simple, a game that I recommend to players that have already played some gateway games and are ready to make the next step.

Medium-light eurogame, elegant and fun!

Very Solid worker-placement game.  The rules can be a bit intense for the first explanation, but catch on quickly.  The dice rolling mechanic is rather uniquely used.  My only complaint would be that one faction seems stronger than all the others, leading to imbalanced play for most games.

I want to like this game, but there's so much holding it back. For one, the board it a mess, it's hard to see things, just not enough contrast. Even if that weren't an issue, the game lacks easy heuristics. I think I won the last game I played, but I didn't really have a plan, nothing to go for. I wasn't making random moves, but I certainly had no goals or strategy. That isn't to say there isn't any, just that it's hard to see. I wouldn't want to play again, but I also don't hate the game.

It's WAY more abstract than I was hoping (especially after having played Viticulture, which is quite thematic), which is quite a shame because it has such a great theme.

A really nice worker placement-game that I've tried and know I really enjoyed. The optimal version would of course be the Deluxe-edition (If I've understood it correct it is a kickstarter-exclusive edition) with the nicely upgraded resources but I'm guessing there are enough of different resources available elsewhere to upgrade the retail-version to a nicer one later. 

What puts the game here and not on wishlist is that I have friends who own it so I don´t really need my own.

Juego de colocación de trabajadores. Los trabajadores son dados. Está muy bien pensada la mecánica. Es diferente a otros juegos de ese estilo. Cada dado aporta un nivel de conocimiento y si el nivel de conocimiento llega a determinado nivel, pierdes un trabajador. Una vez entendidas las reglas es muy rápido de jugar. El turno lleva segundos (si lo tienes pensado). El objetivo es conseguir colocar 10 estrellas en el tablero. Hay diversidad de estrategias para conseguirlo. Está bastante bien. Es un kickstarter. Materiales muy guapos. Yo jugué con la copia de max, que tiene lingotes de oro chulísimos.
Recomendable. Sabiendo jugar, le calculo un par de horas.

A nicely produced worker placement race game with a fun theme, however the game really falls down at 2 players (which is the count I play at). My partner and I are very matched players and throughout the game we remained lock step on star placement. The winner pretty much boiled down to who rolled too many sixes at the end and lost a worker. The game is essentially 'too balanced' with 2 and devolves into a repetitive chore where only the hope of a good/bad roll will crown a winner.

I like the game, and the components are absolutely gorgeous (played with the kickstarter edition). The limited VP options make it quite challenging.

This game was better than I was expecting.   From the theme and name alone I was anticipating something pretty horrible, but it was actually quite enjoyable.   The role cards seem a bit hit or miss, with some that seem far more useful than others.   It's also undeniable that a string of bad rolls can really set you back and effectively knock you out of the game, even if you do try to mitigate them.    I like it though.

What a charming, delightful game! This just might be our new Ticket to Ride: one of the few games that we often want to play again immediately after finishing. Not only is the theme incredibly original and inventive, but it is thoughtfully drawn and incredibly detailed, from the unique role cards to the hilarious construction markets and ethical dilemma cards. Each action you take, each space on the board absolutely oozes theme, which elevates it from being just another dice-placement game to a truly remarkable and memorable gaming experience.

The mechanics are also just as innovative: trying to "game" the dice placement so that you don't retrieve all your workers at once, all the while trying not to bump your opponents' workers back to them, is an absolutely awesome new idea for worker placement. I don't mind the luck element of the dice—though high rolls can cripple a player's work force and doubles do give possibly too much of a benefit—but there is somewhat of a balance issue if more than one person chooses the same faction in their opening hands: by "cooperating" early on, two players can easily gain the benefits of their shared factions and really shoot ahead of the others. Otherwise, fantastic!

Another great game from Stonemaier. I really enjoyed the way the number of pips of your dice matter as to not lose your workers. A very nice twist on a dice-placement game. I also liked the special powers offered by your starting card and how the second may get revealed during the game. I wasn't a huge fan of the board (seemed a bit busy) and I feel like the Wastelanders are a bit underpowered with their resource not being able to be used to get more workers. Nevertheless, a very interesting game for anyone who enjoys a medium-weight Euro.

Theme was fantastic and everything is beautifully crafted, hated the actual game. The board is the same spaces repeated over and over, very uninspired. The game play itself felt like a slow build up and then and explosive ending very dissatisfying. The action efficiency granted by rolling doubles breaks the game, something like that shouldn't be left up to luck (and I say this as the person that had doubles most of the time). I still stand by my decision to back out of the KS campaign. Would not recommend this to anyone.

RATING: 4
There are some really interesting aspects to this game that are unfortunately married to an uninspired resource management game with some unmitigateble luck (although the variants do address this luck a bit).

The dice are the interesting part (even though designwise they are difficult to read and cause for some confusion). Specifically the whole rolling when you receive them, roll too high and you lose them, paired with the intelligence mechanic, the ability to increase your dice pool for a hefty cost, the same intelligence rule gives more actions (but encourages extra workers even though ore workers risks losing them), and the bumpable (dotted lines), semi-permanent (large solid boxes), and slightly more permanent (market builders) spots on the board. Especially the bumpables where opponents might be encouraged to do something not a hundred percent critical right now if it means you'll lose a worker permanently.

However, then we come to the uninspired resource conversion game. Go here, get that, then go there and turn that into those, where three of the go here get that places are identical in all save for what they get you and who benefits long term (which I'll address more in the unfortunate luck section). 

Why is the game a resource conversion game? I can't help but think that there must have been something interesting, or at least, less repetitive than this that could have been done to showcase the whole rolling of dice mechanic. Maybe even something thematic. I've read dystopic fiction quite a bit (took a class on it once, even), never encountered a whole lot on resource generation and transformation or digging tunnels to produce resources, or any of that.

Finally we come to the unfortunate luck, the faction cards and the markets.

A huge help to winning is getting dealt the great faction cards as opposed to the near useless ones, and getting them in the same faction as those chosen by someone else. Neither of which you have any control over. But, if you luck out like that, you are going to have better resource production than the players who didn't get lucky, a special power that is more powerful that theirs (so, very tilted asymmetrical starting positions), and you'll get to place out your stars faster than them (because your influence column will complete first with more players pushing it along helping it complete).

And finally the markets. Being placed face down we never have any knowledge of what we are building, so why choose one over another? It's pure random and tends to cause further problems with the faction dominance because the larger factions will simply build up the markets associated with them and others will have to join in at helping the already dominant faction if they want to get in on those markets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is quite easy, and turns should only take a few seconds. And yet it is incredibly hard to teach and wrap your head around. I wonder if a player guide or a different graphic design might help. 

Maybe I’ll make a reference sheet that says “Need cards? Go tunneling or to Icarus. Need water? Try ___. Have extra stone? Use it for ___.” Etc. The only problem with this game is that new players don’t really have direction, don’t really know what to do next. With some help, I think this could be a bit more obvious.

A very repetitive and luck-filled resource conversion game. Get x resource. Use x to get y. Use y to get z etc. There are a lot of luck elements that are annoying as well. Losing a die hurts a lot, so terrible rolls can ruin your game. Plus, the power of the special cards vary widely and if other people have your color, it is very advantageous for multiple people to be working together, and you're screwed if you're stuck by yourself. There are also huge luck elements with the cards. Getting pairs is absurdly powerful, for no particular reason, and when tiles are filpped, having a particular card can essentially guarantee you a star. 

The worker placement is weak. You are never precluded from going on any space. You just bump the previous guy out. That does create some interesting timing issues, but its very much a solitaire experience. 

The thing barely took an hour with 5 though and it has some charms so its not torture to play (Update after 2nd play: - yeah, it kinda is). Nothing special though.

RATING: 5.5
First of all, I love that this is a worker placement game that has a racing element in it – the first player to get 10 stars immediately wins! That’s always refreshing compared to many eurogames in which you tally up your points at the end. However, that’s probably the only good thing about the game… First of all, it’s just not that interesting to play; the mechanics are pretty basic and the variety is, imho, low. The game tries to camouflage it by giving you rather boring options, and even though the bumping is a good idea, it also means that you cannot really block any space. And if you bump a player, that player then gets an extra turn in which he doesn’t have to retrieve his workers, so your move actually benefits him… 

But by far the worst thing about the game is the randomness…! It oozes of it! It’s random which factories show up and if you have the cards which are needed for those and are following a strategy which suits those. It’s random which cards you draw; 2 of a kind is almost always better than 3 different. And speaking of those cards, the special starting cards are random too and certainly not balanced (which I’m not the only one claiming). And there’s of course the randomness concerning the dice; 2 of a kind is almost always better because you get a double turn… Oh, and I also twice rolled 15 and once 16 (and I only had 1 single brain!) with just 3 dice, while an opponent rolled much lower (which is good) with 4 dice… This essentially meant that I lost a lot of workers due to poor rolls – and there was no way to mitigate this; I had even played as safe as possible as I only had 1 brain… All of this randomness bugs me in a game which claims to be a medium eurogame. It honestly felt like it was random who won…

I’ve played it with 3 and 6, and none of those numbers were particularly good – but even though I would expect 4 to be the best number, the game is still bad. So, yes, my rating is actually generous and should probably be decreased, but I’m willing to give it one final shot.

I wanted to play this for some time now and am glad I did. There's lots going on, almost too much, and lots of strategies that can win the game. At times it can feel chaotic with all the possibilities, and I don't know how well it will play with fewer players. I played with 5 and it worked good, but with fewer it might lack tension.

I enjoy this working placement game, and I like the idea behind playing "stars" as certain events are triggered.  I would like to play it again and form a final opinion, but two of the guys in my regular gaming group don't like it, so it may not hit the table for quite some time.

I enjoyed the game, but more so than my compatriots.  One got hammered with bad luck.  Getting a third worker and immediately rolling over the limit.  Getting a penalty when rolling 1s and then rolling 1s.  It seemed like a lot of game play to take in and work with to then get screwed by dumb luck.  But it was still close.  I enjoyed it the most but ended up trading it.

Euphoria has a lot going for it: a clever theme, a wide-open decision space, beautiful art, quality materials, and unique mechanics. 

My only complaints: the rules can be a bit difficult to learn, but that mostly arises from the unique mechanics.  Once you've got the flow of gameplay down, Euphoria is fast paced and simple.  More significantly, the game can be seemingly unbalanced from the start if multiple players have the same kind of worker.

Overall, I enjoy Euphoria and hope it achieves the success it deserves.

RATING: 5.5
There are some cool things going on with your workers being dice and how crowding workers in a spot changes the value of the space based on the pips.  But it just seems like there is not enough workers going onto the board, at least in a 3 player game.  Not enough workers changing space values, or workers being bumped, or space blocking.  Getting more workers would normally seem like a great move, but even with the best knowledge penalty your still likely to lose even your third worker after a couple above average rolls (at least it feels like it) and the extra workers are prohibitively expensive.  The real killer for me is the market penalties where if you roll a number you lose something (your progress) and it can be a real pain to get out of that penalty.  It has some exciting things happening, like the ethical choice, but I just don't think its put together well.

The components are top-notched.  The mechanics are smooth.  It looks like the enhanced version of the  Alien Frontiers.  The pick and place action is also similar to the Mayan Calendar.   It is a nice worker pick and place dice rolling game.  The Euphoria is good for gamers as it supports some brain burning options and multiple paths for gamers.  Although it is more complicated and with more options than the Alien Frontiers, the options are not too overwhelming like some Euro games.  The depth lies between gamers and non-gamers game.  Paying it will have so much fun.  However, the game is lack of its uniqueness and theme carrying.

Euphoria I would term a "quirky classic" - some very odd mechanics work together surprisingly well. I was worried that the markets would totally stitch up players and lead to runaway losers but it is possible to remedy a lockout at the cost of a set of artefact cards. Effectively if you get locked out of a market you just have to pay more. With some markets though you cannot afford to be locked out for too long as the penalties can be severe: you therefore need to drop everything else and deal with the problem. Euphoria reminds me a little bit from every dystopian story I've ever read( and I very much enjoy these) so good thematic integration. The components? Well these have to be the best I have ever seen: Euphoria would definitely rate a 10 for design and production values.

RATING: 4
Dice placement efficiency game with an innovative element (worker bumping) and great components. Unfortunately the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired, as there is too much luck in the game: recruit and artefact card draws, some combos are overpowering (eg 2x icarites) and some recruit cards are profoundly better than others. In addition, it has a long setup/tear down time due to the multitude of resources, and is quite fiddly, as you are prone to forget what penalties you are under at any time. The theme is not well supported by the mechanisms of the game, and the various commodities and resources do mostly the same thing, in different positions.

Overall, enjoyable for a game or two, but not one I will seek to play ever again.

A dice allocation game. 

Has some elements in common with others in this genre such as alien frontiers, and has a similar mechanic to Tzoklin (in terms of the way you allocate or retrieve your dice each turn - i.e. you do one or the other). 

This is a solid game, and I liked the theme, even if it felt a bit pasted on in parts. Would play again for sure, however I think Alien Frontiers is a better game.

Very successful first play. Everyone liked it. Even with 6 players, which was a bit scary. Nice touch of cute theme flavor text. I was surprised it was appreciated even from 18xx gamers. I have to say, though, it's a bit of a project to wrap your head around what you're supposed to do on the first go. It seems like a fairly standard worker placement for the most part, but what I like is the element of cooperation that is pretty heavily woven into multiple aspects of the game.

Its rare when I rate a game after just one play, but I seriously doubt this game is for me. The game felt slow to develop with too many different resources that were merely exchanged and re-exchanged. I was hoping that the dystopian theme would fit into the mechanics, but it really didn't. The market mechanism felt tacked on.  The whole thing feels like a poster child for Kickstarter games that need a good developer.  On the plus side, visually the game looked great with fantastic bits, but that alone does not make the game.  Sadly a missed opportunity.

Bureaucracy in a box. The theme doesn't do anything for the game. The board layout is horrible. Had to open and run the game at a convention, took 45 minutes for set up and then two hours to play. Players were experienced with Worker Placement type games and no one enjoyed it. By the end of almost 3 hours we had finally figured out the game mechanics, where everything was on the board, and how none of it had anything to do with the theme.  One of the least enjoyable games (for me and the players) at the con that year.

As for a plus, rule book was very detailed and offered lots of information. I give the company kudos for getting it all in there, but their organization of the rule book left a lot to be desired, however, I'm not sure I could do a better job of organizing that data. This to me is a sign that they failed when they put the whole thing together.

This really felt like a game where the designer had left-over rules from other projects and told their art director to throw something on the board to make it gel.

Enjoyed my one play of it more than expected. Not sure how much I like the whole "lose a worker if you roll high" idea. Also, I am really not a fan of the mechanic where you have to take your actions back as an action, but it works here because almost no action is blocked and you are never "freeing up" spaces by doing this.  I would definitely play this again.

I really enjoy worker placement games, but it can be tough to inject the genre with anything new.  Yet this game has done that quite nicely, and I can't wait to play it again.

In Euphoria you're trying to have your workers contribute to a dystopian society without becoming too aware of what's going on around them (solution: don't keep them together if you can help it).  You're gathering resources and trading them in for what you need to earn points.  But one key mechanism which really works are the building of markets, which require some group collaboration.  Whomever doesn't contribute faces a stiff penalty, so negotiation becomes a necessary evil.

Meanwhile most actions you take will advance the power of 1 of 4 factions, and as those factions grow, so do their bonuses, and you might get to reveal a helper card for an even bigger bonus.  With that there's a little bit of a hidden role aspect (as in which faction you want to "win").

Complicated rules, but once gameplay gets up to speed it works really well.  Beautiful production values.  Definitely worth checking out if you'd like a twist on your typical Eurogame.

This game is gorgeous, clearly a labor of love, and has some really interesting concepts / systems / rules. (Some favorites: the "avoid a penalty" market dynamic; the secondary effects on farm harvesting; the effects of recruits on some action spaces.)

But ultimately, the role (roll?) of chance is both too prominent and too powerful for my tastes - mostly in losing workers due to too much knowledge (awesome concept, though) and in "go again on doubles", with recruit variability also seeming a bit rough.

Some have said that there's no interaction because workers don't block each other. This is untrue; there's plenty of interaction elsewhere (market-building, faction-status, mining, and farm rewards), as well as in the worker-placement piece - it's just that anticipating where someone else wants to go gives you a benefit (free worker reclaim) instead of giving them a penalty (can't take action).

Vous en savez trop.Ou pas assez ... on ne sait pas. Mais vous venez d'apprendre quelque chose de fou. Le père Noël n'existe pas ! (Heureusement que le groupe jeux existe, lui !).

Played with 6 players. While I got the game fairly quickly, most people had issues with the rules, and I can't even start to think how to teach this game to others. The depth of the game feels artificial, There are a lot of spots but the majority do the same stuff. Also, I really dislike games where you get punished for not doing stuff or you always need to make sure you have enough of X when Y happens otherwise you lose points (think agricola and feeding families). This game punishes player for not participating in markets. So that sucked the fun out of the game.

A dice-rolling game with fantastic components. Interestingly, the dice are most often used simply as workers, with no regard to the value shown on the die. (So, there's less luck than you might expect from a dice-centric game.)

Given the theme, I was expecting some more serious "ethical dilemma" types of choices and deeper gameplay, but the game is actually a fairly straightforward grab of resources (including cards) and exchanging them for points. Like Catan, it's a race to 10 points, so it shares the good and the bad of that mechanic.

(There are also recruit cards which provide some special powers and asymmetry and a little punishment in the game if you don't help build and open certain areas.)

Although I was expecting something a little different, it's definitely a good game for what it sets out to be.

Two plays in, this is a minor hit. It's imposing at first, but after a few turns everything flows smoothly. It's more tactical than strategic -- rather than picking a strategy and sticking to it, you get to try a number of different angles over the course of the game. Couple that with the reasonable play time, and Euphoria doesn't outstay its welcome.

It's a worker-placement game where your workers don't get locked out of most spaces. Instead, some spaces allow you to bump another player's worker (giving that player the advantage of retrieving the worker without taking a retrieval turn), while others allow you join other players' workers (with the result affected by all the workers in the space). These elements cleverly remove the frustration factor of many other WP games.

It's a little on the dry side to be sure, but that's partially mitigated by the truly wonderful components, especially the Kickstarter "realistic" resource tokens. If it weren't for the physical awesomeness, I might rate this a half point lower.

RATING: 5
Another mix of dice and worker placement. It's interesting if a bit chaotic, as much of your strategy will hinge on what the other players do, what you draw and, of course, what you roll. Still, it seems like there's some strategy and meaningful decisions, so it's still interesting. The characters that provide bonuses and the overall theme are a nice touch.

That said, it seems the trend now among eurogames, in an effort to stay interesting, is an ever increasing set of complex relationships between resources and goals. I feel like eurogame design has hit a wall to some degree, and this game is right up against it.

The mechanism that makes Euphoria stand out from other worker placement games is the ability to bump workers --- one's own or another player's --- from their placements. The bumpee (by getting bumped by his own workers or by anticipating the placements of other players) can employ this feature to great strategic effect to minimize the number of turns that he must use to retrieve workers. Although the bump is less useful to the bumper, he still may want to do it to force the bumpee into a knowledge check that may result in the loss of a worker.

The Catan-like race to ten also is a welcome departure from the usual goal of accumulating victory points.

I've only played this game once, so I will update this later if I play it again.  There was a heck of a lot going on in the game and this may turn new players away because of the complexity of the game.  The board was not designed to be very user friendly.  There may have been a bit of an over reliance on symbols and they throw the beginning player off a bit.  The board is a bit too busy and tended to overwhelm the eye because there was not enough space in between the different areas.  I really did like the game, but I think I will need to play it again to see if I love it.

[2014-03-21 Rating: n.a. -> 7.5]
Another rating after only one game but since I don't own the game, I'm not sure whether I'll get another chance to play it. So this is more of an impression than a solid opinion that I've formed after a lot plays.

All in all, Euphoria is a game I really enjoyed playing. It takes a bit to get into the game and make the best of all the options the game presents to you and find the best way to get ahead in the race that is Euphoria. While the board is a little too busy for my taste and I would have preferred more readable dice, there are a lot of cool ideas in it so that Euphoria doesn't feel like the umpteenth worker placement game.

I think that it's a great idea that you should contribute to building locations in order to prevent their negative effects. Would have been great if you would know from the beginning what it's effect is, but that is just a minor quibble I have. Normally you build stuff to get better things, here it is like reverse engine building. Nice.

I do also like the pulling back of workers and especially the "bumping" places where you get workers back if someone else or you use that place again. Brilliant idea that I would love to see implemented in other games too. Makes you really think if you do really need that space if it would help someone else getting back their worker. On the other hand it allows for some clever play if someone has an already intelligent workforce and that one worker they would have to take back might make them lose a worker. I learned this small tactic the hard way. Brilliant stuff.

What I'm not so sure about is how much luck there is in this game. Take for instance the artifact draw in which the winner of my one game constantly managed to draw two matching cards. This gave him a small boost against the other players. But in the end it wasn't too bad since I only was one point behind him. I hope I'll get another chance to see for myself how big of an role luck plays in this game.

At the end of the game it was clear another player would win in two turns and it would take me three. We decided to play it out, quickly. I rolled doubles so I got to take two actions at once.

I won a two-hour euro with a 3.1 rating on the BGG weight scale and an average rating of 7.4 [i]because I rolled doubles. 

Really.[/i]

I suspect the high average rating is an artifact of the aggressive stretch goals in the kickstarter campaign. People either forget or are reluctant to admit that the game they paid so much for, and hyped the hell out of it so they would get better bits, turned out a mess. The bits, however, do look pretty good.

Bizarre theme that seems pasted on.  I didn't really get where they were going with the whole George Orwell type mythos.  The game has punishing mechanics like losing workers based on die rolls and failing to contribute to markets adds negative rules just for those players.  A bit more complex then it needs to be.  Overall I think it's a decent game, but I won't be playing this one again.

RATING: 7
It's a fine game.  All the mechanisms work well enough, and there are interesting decisions to make.  On the downside, the board, while pretty to look at, actively works against understanding.  If you're going to make symmetric groupings in the game, why not make them symmetric on the board?  On that point, three of the four peoples are pretty much exactly the same, which is fine, but uninteresting.  The designers clearly saw the benefit of making the groups asymmetric with the cloud people.  Anyway, as I say, it's a fine game.  I'd be fine playing again, though it doesn't excite me.

Gorgeous pieces, I mean really super cool stuff (the kickstarter version at least). 

The game is good as well, but somehow I still felt that the multiple ways of winning is all about rolling doubles and not losing dice to too high rolls.

Just bordering on being too fiddly (not enough that I don't like it). There are many, many things I like about the game. The art, the roll and place dice worker placement, the components... The one thing I don't like is the length of the game. I feel like the game goes on for too long. I think it could easily end at 7 or 8 stars. I won't house rule it, but I would love to see the game made shorter in a second edition (please Jamey!). Great game otherwise.

Lovely worker placement game. You get that feeling where you just need to get that resource and you can get your victory star out. I love it when you get the since you are so close to building what you need and then somebody takes it away from you. The nice thing about this game is there are other opportunities to get what you need The artwork is nice but the rulebook could've done with a little bit more polishing Overall a nice game but the kick starter version is much better

RATING: 5
Players are racing to be the first society to place 10 stars onto the game board.

Worker placement game, where the hook here is the workers are dice you roll.  High numbers denote increased intelligence, and if your worker pool total is too high, they become aware they are in a dystopia and leave.  You need to shock/hydrate a new worker into life to replace them.

Other than that, it's standard place, accumulate, convert and generally mince stuff to that stars are popped out the other end.  Lots of random penalities if you get caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. 

I didn't care for this - an excellent example of a modern average Kickstarter worker placement game, where the bloom is truly off the rose.  It is interesting to compare this with the recent Russian Railroads, also a worker placement game, but from a professional publisher - the difference in game play quality is astonishing.  

Euphoria does have excellent production though - the pieces are amazing.

Nice, meaty worker placement game, with some neat little twists. The Intelligence mechanic means that you have to make sure you really need a new worker before buying it since it might not even come into play, It quickly becomes a nice rubber-band mechanic. 
The Markets, once built, lend the game a nice amount of nastiness as the condition on them can be a pain in the ass and give the game a nice dimension.
Very good game, recommended.

This game definitely brings some novel ideas into the worker placement genre, with its unique use of dice and interesting game flow.  I very much respect it for its beautiful artwork, absolutely stunning production, original theme, and novel mechanisms.  However, after a few games it started to feel a bit samey, despite all the stuff going on.  Also, this game is all about tempo, not blocking, which is odd for a worker placement and something that I don't find as satisfying.  

I am hopeful the the expansion revitalizes this game as much as Tuscany did for Kickstarter.  That may get me to take another look at it.

Some great ideas here - but in the end it all feels somewhat hollow.

The mechanics are sound.   The theme is weird... but also sound.    The bridge between the two, however, is not.   Nothing in this game makes sense.   It's clear what the actions do and what the costs are, but there is no intuitive arc here.  I didn't get a sense of motive or objective whatsoever.  The bits are nice and the play time is short (about an hour).   I also like the victory conditions (place 10 stars) instead of more traditional VP scoring.  I guess if you want a more advanced "Alien Frontiers", this might be up your alley.  But if we're playing a worker placement game, this doesn't make my short list.

Beautiful, no, wonderful game! Great worker placement with beautiful dystopian theme and clever use of dice as workers. Number on a die represent the knowledge of a worker and if worker is too smart he might deflect and that is not good. You need you workers dumb and happy. Board game is vivid, colourful and eventful, with 4 different factions living in a world whose allegiance the players will fight for.

The game is, in its essence, a race for influence and control and it ends when first player places his 10th influence marker (star). Game flows brilliantly in continuous turns, but only until last few turns when the winner is obvious which makes those turns quite redundant. So far, none of the games had exciting finish. I guess that might be changed with more plays, especially because the game is very very enjoyable.

[b]Update:[/b] As I presumed, with more plays every game became more and more exciting and unpredictable until the very end.
Upgraded from 8.5 to 9.
[b]Update:[/b] The game needs more teeth. It would be very common that you know what the player is up to and what his strategy is but you just can't do absolutely anything about it. Downgraded to 8.6.
[b]Update:[/b] Rating modified according to a custom rating system.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Getting bigger numbers on worker dice can bring you more stuff but can also potentially cost you that worker because he is too smart for this world.

Reminds me a lot of Manhattan Project, but I feel the implementation of theme is a little weaker here.  Of course, you don't play this kind of game for theme.

Like in Manhattan Project, I immensely enjoy the strategic choice of when and how many workers you take back into the pool.  Unfortunately, on a personal level, this seems to never work out in my favor since I am, and I quote, "quite ballsy" and like to gamble.  That's not a hit against the game, of course.

I think this is a pretty great game with tons of paths towards victory and none of them feel all points-salady.  Like any other Euro, you gotta figure out what you want to do and just stick to executing it.  I am far too often too tempted to try everything and master nothing, which just means I'm always trailing.

However, a big strength of the game is that no matter what we pursued, be it single-minded or multi-faceted, the scores remained pretty close.  To me, that just screams balance.

Starting recruit cards are not balanced.  Some are worthless while some are incredibly useful.  Bad dice rolls can ruin a player's ability to advance.  Dice rolls are too critical to success.  There are too many other good worker placement games out there to make this one worthwhile.  If you want worker placement and dice, I suggest Alien Frontiers.

2016-01-17 : if you look beyond the pretty components and graphics you see a very, very basic game of resource gathering, converting those to a secondary type of resource, converting those to victory points with helpers letting you break the rules in minor ways. The problem with the game is that there is no such thing as developing a long-term strategy in it, you simply do the best you can with what is randomly given to you through the dice and cards. Now, a purely tactical game can also be fun, provided it doesn't overstay its welcome - which this game does. All in all a mediocre design, saved by the graphics and components.

Euphoria is a dice placement euro where players are trying to rid themselves of 10 stars... or attain 10 VP... however you want to look at it. There are a number of interesting aspects to Euphoria:

-Each player starts with 2 unique player powers (though one is active and the other is face-down and inactive). Each of these player powers are associated with 4 of the game's factions. These factions can be advanced to help unlock greater benefits for players who own player powers of the associated faction.

-There are areas that players can construct on their own or collectively. When constructed, a new worker placement slot opens and players who didn't contribute to the construction are affected by it's specific negative ability. Players can, however,  take actions to alleviate these conditions.

-There is a system of pulling your workers or placing a worker. When pulling, you have to be careful to not try an exceed a certain number of pips between your dice and a track of fictitious pips, or you will be penalized. How can you be careful with dice rolling? Well, you can pull less than your total number of dice and you can manage a track that affects your pip value. There are a number of worker places that can hold infinite dice or doesn't block people from placing their own dice. When a player is kicked, it's actually somewhat beneficial because they can go longer without having to pull dice, unless this causes you to exceed the pip value. In fact, you can kick your own workers to extend the time needed before pulling... though these spots tend to require resources, so you won't be able to do them infinitely.

There is more that could be said, but just know that you're going into a game with a plethora of options, but is also fairly random. This randomness could be quite a bother to people. Here are some random aspects...

-Dealt player powers are not created equally.
-Rolling doubles can essentially allow you to do a double turn, which ends up being very beneficial
-Rolling too high can cost your some of your dice workers
-If more than one person starts with the same faction of player powers, they can collectively build that faction up quicker, to gain additional benefits quicker.
-Certain construction's negative affects can randomly screw you more than it screws other people, depending on the board situation.
-There is a card collection mechanism. It's beneficial to get sets and certain aspects of the game want specific cards, which you randomly may not get for a while.

Despite the randomness, I find it to be a fairly enjoyable experience. There are even also supposed to be some official variants that, I believe, can reduce some of the random aspects mentioned above. That said, I haven't read them. Regardless, the game is quicker to play than most worker placement games (especially considering it can go up to 6), includes a fair amount of variety (at least with regards to the player powers and constructions), has less blocking and seemingly more options than most games in this genre, has nice components/graphic design, and seems to be fairly easy to teach. Unfortunately, dice euros are becoming a crowded field with many great entries, but this still might be worthwhile entry depending on your preferences.

Great theme with cool mechanisms. It's easy to set up and quick to play, although it takes a game or two to really see how everything fits together. Although fun with just two players, because you can't really ever block another player from going somewhere, I think it would play better with more players because it would increase the amount of interaction. I'm not a huge fan of games where the end is a race to X points (*cough* Catan *cough*), but for some reason I like it in Euphoria and am really happy to have this game in my collection.

I had a big helping of Beginner’s Luck here as I never lost a worker and people did a lot of things that benefitted me at just the right time. My starting card gave me a benefit when others rolled doubles, and doubles they rolled. Consequently, I can’t help but wonder about how dependent the game is on luck and how balanced the cards are. You get a special power card at game start, and the one I got worked out very well, especially as compared to the other ones I saw during the game. Furthermore, seems like there’d be a large advantage to one player starting the game with two cards of the same faction (though that’d be easy to house rule if that’s the case). 

At first the game seems quite opaque due to numerous places where you can play, but you really only need to focus on one area that complements whatever guild you’re working. You want to find an efficient way to place stars on the board as it’s a race in that regard, and I’m just not sure after one play if there’s depth here or just a lot of different things that, once experienced, will feel same-y such that it will come down to card pulls and who rolls better. From the comments I read of others, it seems that's the case.

RATING: 5
Fantastic presentation and at first glance an interesting theme. I wanted to like this game.

But... the game is very basic. And there's precious little connection with the theme. Workers gain knowledge but it evaporates every dice roll. Workers are lost due to knowledge gain, but where do they go? Why is 'building a better dystopia' achieved by controlling markets for antiques? 

Euphoria's niche role is as a quick playing worker placement race to place ten authority markers. 

Satisfactory, I suppose, but I don't think Euphoria has the legs or charm to warrant repeat play. An inferior worker placement option, with little to recommend it other than its presentation.

Revised character cards included.

I put off playing this game for two years, based on how intimidating the board looked and how many pieces there were; don't be fooled!

RATING: N/A
I love, love, love:
- the race style of gameplay
- the dark? humor
- the component quality and artwork
- the gorgeous main board and that the resources don't take away from the artwork when added to the board

I dislike:
- the rather blah Artifacts 
- that losing out on the markets can really punish players (I don't agree with this idea of beating down on someone who's already behind--the player has missed out on a star and is falling behind, so why punish someone that's falling behind even more?)
- that every ethical dilemma results in the same two choices (Why even bother with making so many cards that all give the same results? Either design this part of the game differently or don't bother at all.)
- that the theme isn't THAT strong, despite there being a story to try to make the mechanisms/board logical)

Final verdict: Need more plays...

Like Troyes, it is a worker-placement game where dice are your workers. But it takes that mechanic and makes it really innovative with the laborer cards and construction sites, and the fact that at its heart it is a race game rather than a point game. The theme and art are especially unique. Never saw a game that looked quite like this one! Troyes is smoother, but this game is a great change of pace.

Looks more complicated that it really is(because of the various game elements)but once you familiarise yourself with them, it flows pretty smoothly. I bought the game because I liked the theme (working hard to keep your workers dumb and happy while they are running around to collect resources for you because once they become smart, they'll just run off and find somewhere better to live ??)and the board ... Yes, beginning can feel a bit overwhelming with so many choices available to everybody from the first moment; but you get used to them very quickly and then it is just pure fun.

I like this game, but it feels like it ends too soon to me.  I'm just at the point where I think I have good momentum going and suddenly someone else wins.  I think its just my play style.

One weakness of this game that I noticed there is a distinct core usefulness of one resource over the others, and since cards you are randomly dealt at the beginning can help you with this resource, anyone who gets those cards has an advantage over anyone who doesn't.

Otherwise great thematic elements, reminiscent of Agricola, but only just, so its definitely its own distinct game.

Worker placement is apparently a genre that is still evolving. You think you've seen it all, and then the next game comes along and proves you wrong. In this case, adding more workers to your pool increases the risk that you have to return one again when you retrieve them. It's a bit of a push-your-luck element in an unexpected place. The rest of the game is the old cycle of collecting resources and then turning them into victory points, so not something to induce euphoria although it works just fine.

It's a good idea to give players asymmetrical starting positions and different incentives in a game like this but the recruits in Euphoria don't seem to be very balanced and can easily tilt the game right from the start, just like the rule for rolling doubles strongly favours those with lucky rolls during the game.

Die unterschiedlich starken Startspielerkarten in Beziehung zu den Karten, die die anderen Mitspieler wählen, scheinen eine Richtung vorzugeben, die Sieg und Niederlage früh zu determinieren scheint in einem Rennspiel, das sich sehr linear und klassisch spielt. Mich stimmt, bei allem negativen Klang, der in meinen Worten aus einer düsteren Zukunft mitschwingt, EUPHORIA dennoch -rational unerklärlich- euphorisch. Hurrah, EUPHORIA!

Conclusion
Lots of good things in a game with lots of strategy that does not take more then 60 min to play. That is superawesome, but there are too many strategy elements and if you are unlucky with one of them you will not win. There is a push your luck element so you can choose to take smaller risk, but if you are unlucky it is really bad and you get nothing in return for your bad luck. There is no way to really mitigate the randomness. Therefore, I would like to play it again, but I would much rather play Scythe or Viticulture from the same designer. 

Good
+ Fun theme, although the game is not heavy on theme. 
+ Nice components, very nice dice (although they functions just as regular d6 dice)
+ Easy to play once you learn it. 
+ Quick turns.
+ Strategic depth in rather short time
+ Nice combos that improve your actions. When you do something you often get something more or something else happens that is good for you if you are friends with a faction. 
+ Action placement where you can push workers home and if you do not have any workers home you need to spend a turn taking home workers. If you can foresee what other players want to do you get your workers back without doing an action. That is a great mechanism. 
+ Get one resource type to do another action to trade that to another resource type and with that resource you can build something is ok, combined with other worker placement spots it is nice.
+ When something is build everyone who built part of it get a star (VP) and those who didn´t get something bad. (I would have prefered to get something good if you build it but still good)
+ When you take some actions you get 1 resource and something good happens if die sum is 1-4. If die sum is 5-8 you get 1 resource and something else good happens, if die sum is 9 or more you get 2 resouces and something bad happens. This works really well and make you pick a specific die on a specific action so that you get what you want. 

Bad
- Randomness can have too big effect on outcome. (but didn't in the game I played, I won so it was obviously pure luck)
- Roll two of the same and you get a free turn. 
- Roll too high and you will loose a worker. That could hurt alot, if it happens when you have 2 dice you will not win the game. 
- Starting cards are very unbalanced and even though you get 4 and pick 2 you may not get a great start card.
- 3 Factions in the game are exaclty the same, that makes it easier to make decitions but makes the theme feel a little thin. 
- Quite difficult rules to explain. 
- Hidden buildings can be very bad for you not to build or really does not matter at all
- Text on hidden buildings is small and it is hard to remember that something bad happens to you when you roll a 3 because you have not got a star on a building. 
- Very dependent on other players actions and luck when it comes to what factions they like. If you are the only one who like a faction you will not win.

My first play of this game was really neat. I love the components and the brain burning decisions you must make each turn. The theme is very imaginable as well. An example of the components in this game are the bricks. Every little brick looks like a real brick and each brick is different. Some even look to have mortar on them, where others don't. Way cool. I traded Legendary : Alien Encounters for the game. A friend I board gamed with had won it during the 2014 10 x 10 game challenge. He was really lucky to win it, and then I was yet lucky to have it end up in my collection. We were both happy with our straight up trade. I'm hoping the expansion for this will have a very good solo variant to play.

I had no intention of buying this game on KS. I pledged a dollar in hopes to convince the creator to put in an option to buy a print of the game board without buying the game. Then I decided to make the PnP one day and needless to say, I have pledged for this amazing game on KS. My wife and I have now played 4 games and each game involved us both using different strategies thanks to the games recruit cards (you choose 2 recruits out of 4 each game...48 unique cards in the game total). We also love the fact that you need to constantly control your workers intelligence or face possibly losing them. All and all, this is a great game that I am very happy I took the time to make a PnP of.

Stunningly beautiful game bits.  Gameplay is chaotic, with many bad surprises.  For example, in our 6p game, only 4 could be in on each great work, and the penalty could be mild, or quite nasty, like losing workers every time you get a certain die roll.  Yikes!  You don't even know what building you're working on until after it's completed and revealed.  Oh, and rolling doubles (or triples) means you taken extra turns with no cost?  It's really the antithesis of strategy.  Just roll well.

There's subtlety and nuance to placing workers due to how they can stay out there or be bumped back to your active supply, and a bit of odd alliance when others want to bump your faction or other objective.  All in all, however, the chaos overwhelms the strategy, making for more frustration than a sense of puzzling things out.

Beautiful to look at and a fun theme.  Really pretty quality components.  The different player factions are well represented on the board and in the cards and they play off each other in unique ways.  Colorful, original, great use of dice, and a tense close finish make this a great game!  Scales well too.

Once you get past the busy board, there seems to be a decent worker placement game here. Some of the recruits seem stronger than others and not getting in on markets can be pretty punishing. Using your dice as workers is kind of interesting. I have to say, I'm not a huge fan of the components, even the wooden ones seem cheap. Also, the Kickstarter backer portraits on recruit cards just look silly.

Euphoria : Build a Better Distopia is a worker placement with dice game for 2 to 6 player.
One your turn, you either place a worker or remove one or more worker.  You do the action when you place worker.  You can bump previously place worker belonging to any player including yourself.  Each time you retrieve worker, you roll to see their knowledge and add the score to your society knowledge.  If it's too high, one of them realize that he's in a distopia and leave.
You also have 2 recruit that belong to one of the four allegiance.  These recruit give unique bonuses throughout the game.  One of your recruit is active at the start of the game while the other is not.  There is a common track for each of the four allegiance.  When the marker for each allegiance reach a certain point, it gives bonuses to the players who have an active recruit of this allegiance.  Its also when the allegiance track reach a certain point that player can activate their other recruit.
The first player to place his 10 authority token win the game.

The game can be overwhelming at first because of all the stuff on the board and there is so many things that can be done but after a few turns it become very fluid.  The first game I played was a 3 player game and it took us 60 minutes to play the game.  It was way quicker than I was expecting!  The game is fast, there is no downtime which is great!  It's probably my best 6 player game that plays in less 90 minute.

1 play so far and it was a struggle to get my head around what I needed to do, and how best to do it. By game's end I felt I was getting there...

Worker placement, push your luck, hidden allies, and thoughtful planning all go into making this a very good game. I like that you can get others to push your agenda along, ie advancing Allegances.

150615: Played with 6 players, and instead of bogging down the game actually rocked along. Having multiple players pushing the same agenda means bonuses come up much faster.

After one play, it's clear the theme is tenuous because the mechanics are predominantly worker placement. What makes it  interesting is the penalty system of the market cards—if a player does not participate in unlocking a market, that market will cause him to suffer a penalty for the rest of the game—he won't be able to take a particular action or earn a given bonus.

That means the players have to pay constant attention and not necessarily try to race to win, because they may find themselves crippled right at the end of the game.

Less fun than the sum of its parts, which is really too bad-- because the art and presentation are great, and often one of the things great visual presentation gets you is that you can knit some stuff together that wouldn't otherwise work as a whole. I don't think they quite pulled it off in this case.

So there's some set collection and some worker-placement (kinda) and some cube-pushing. And a little hidden loyalty. Most of those are pretty okay. Which means this game is pretty okay.

Was pretty interesting and could end up going up or down in rating.  I suspect this game will be very close to The Manhattan Project in my opinions.  It fixes a lot of what has kept me away from worker placement games, but the theme integration is on the lower side and the engine building is not as robust as I prefer.  Setup is fairly involved and footprint fairly large, but most fans of the genre wont mind.

RATING: 5
A strange and loose worker placement game with very little blocking. I had some fun with it, but it's more complex and much more random than it needed to be.

The use of dice as workers mostly serve to give players extra turns by rolling doubles and to make them lose workers when rolling too high (which in practice means losing several turns). There are also random buildings that penalize players who don't participate in their construction, but the penalties vary from very mild to really harsh, and they are only revealed when the building is completed. Interaction is usually indirect and involuntary: for example, you get special power cards from various factions, and having the same faction as an opponent can be very beneficial. Artifact cards are completely random draws and you simply are lucky or not to get pairs and specific artifacts you need.

The dystopia theme is interesting, but the game feels very abstract. You basically get commodities and convert them into resources that then you exchange for a victory point for some unexplained reason. Also, the art style does nothing for me.

There might be a good game in there, but the lack of development and poor design decisions prevent it from rising above mediocrity, pretty much like the designer's previous effort, "Viticulture".

Pros: The theme is really fun in this game and the bumping mechanism is well done.  I absolutely love the use of dice as workers and the "knowledge" limitations placed on the workforce.

Cons: Some of the actions seem useless for less than 4 or 5 players.  The game plays especially poorly with 2 players since there are so many options that players can almost entirely avoid confrontation.  While the theme fits well with the workers games quickly fall into a generic resource conversion game.  Penalties from not participating in building markets can be easy to track during the game.

Overall, good game and lots of funny moments if you are willing to run with the theme.

Col·locació de treballadors (tipus Tzolk'in: o poses un o treus els que vols) amb gestió de recursos. Guanya el primer jugador en col·locar un cert nombre de elements al taulell. Els treballadors es representen amb daus de 6 i la suma del seu valor te una influencia negativa quant més alt és:

Els daus es tornen a llençar quan els reculls, el que afegeix molt atzar. Les mecàniques no semblen especialment lligades (tipus Vinhos, Tzolk'in, etc...) i hi han algunes coses que donen la impresió de estar allà per que si (les cartes de dilema moral). En general em sembla poc atractiu, les mecàniques no em convencen i el tema dels daus no m'acostuma a agradar (Troyes, Alien Frontiers, Bora Bora, etc...)

A good medium/light weight worker/dice-placement game, but it's fairly generic.
The thing that differentiate it from most worker placement games is that you can't block spaces from other players (instead, the "blocking" worker is returned to the owner). That sort of removes most of the tension and makes the game a lot more "multiplayer solitaire"-ish.
Using dice as workers doesn't really affect the game play much. It's more of a gimmick.

Euphoria is a very clever die placement game, with multiple paths towards victory that eventually boils down to area control.

Players try to allocate all their tokens onto the board, by completing structures, trading in markets, recruit influence, or other activities.

To place a token generally requires resources, currencies, and/or a free worker to use. But the number of workers is very limited, so the worker allocation choices are tricky, and planning for actions is important.

Having the resources to claim a spot at the right time is key; miss out too much and you'll be watching your opponent's backside when they win.

The kickstarter bits are among the best I have ever seen

I liked the game a lot on a first play; I am starting the rating for Euphoria at a 7.25.

There are a lot of choices, and it will be interesting to sort out strategies and paths to victory.

[b]tl;dr[/b] — An ultimately tedious affair allowed to go on too long only because it was beautiful.  Problems arose early in our 17 plays, but we chalked those up to our lack of experience, choosing to trust the designer's vision and skill rather than assume a lack of development.  Turns out we were wrong.  Unfortunately half-baked. 

[microbadge=28503]

[b]T[/b]he handpicked crowd was cheering, as they were obligated to do, when we met for the last time at the podium.  We smiled like the serpents we were and clasped hands as murderous apes must, and [i]sotto voce[/i], beyond the reach of the mic, you breathed:

"I'll see you shot or hanged.  Maybe both."

My smile broadened as I clapped you on the back and turned to the auto-exaltation of the crowd.  "That would be just the thing, wouldn't it," I hissed through my teeth, "Just the thing for a [i]traitor[/i]."

All that work for all those years, from the moment of dark enlightenment through the weaving of our self-culling networks, our ambitions entwining and diverging as power increased and our foes fell away, all that work to be the one wearing Orwell's boot—[i]forever[/i]—undone in a blink as the terrorist bomb ripped through the reviewing stand.

Our memorial statues were revealed that same day, the day the new regime promised to bring the haters of freedom to a terrible justice, for that is what, above all, the Republic stands for.

[microbadge=28503]

Mechanically, this is just a [i]grind nibs to trade for nobs and score dinguses[/i] worker-placement affair... but I'm not here for any of that.  Just know that all the mechanical stuff works, and works just fine.

What sets this apart, though, is the theme and the way that theme is brilliantly woven into the proceedings.  For example, everyone begins the game with a revealed recruit from one of four factions, as well as a hidden recruit to be revealed later.  Players sharing the same faction will end up working semi-cooperatively—helping to dig the same tunnel, pushing the same allegiance track forward to increase their faction's power.  The unrevealed recruits add the wrinkle of undeclared alliances—if my mole is the same faction as your active recruit then I know we're kinda in cahoots*... something of which you're not necessarily aware.  [i]Delicious[/i].

[size=7]*At least until I go for placing my final authority star and have you cast head-first and handcuffed into the Pit of Justice.[/size]

There are so many other bright things I could point to—the unrestricted trade of commodities, resources and artifacts; colluding to freeze other players out of constuction sites; the way low morale hinders your ability to collect artifacts (disaffected workers will rat you out to superiors); and on and on and on...

The attention to detail and the organic cohesion of theme, mechanics, and presentation are breathtaking.

I could very easily see this becoming one of my favorite games—instead of farming to impress the king how 'bout if I impress myself by lobotimizing some workers?

[i]Get in the machine, you![/i]

UPDATE:  Enjoying this enough that I popped for the "Supreme" version, both to get the up-rezzed bits (gold bricks!  [i]brick[/i] bricks!  tiny stones!) and to get the "faceless" recruits as I'm deathly allergic to [thread=1059815]"girlfriend mage"[/thread].  You see, the game comes with fish-out-of-water backer faces inserted into the art; not being an actual backer myself, I figured the "faceless" recruits would look like these:

[imageid=1901168 original]
But they don't...  And one is even a baby—[i]a baby[/i].

[i]Sigh.[/i]  The moral of the story is that there's no reason to splurge and scramble for an aftermarket "Supreme" edition—"Deluxe" works just fine if you want the super-fancy stuff.

UP-UPDATE:  In actual play I find that the backer-face recruits don't annoy me as much as I thought they would; in fact, the little bit of personality they add to the game is... actually kinda nice, I suppose.  Still, if they ever end up offering the original faceless ones I'd grab 'em, no hesitation.

PS.  If you're wondering what to do with those allegiance bonus markers, try [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/15121843#15121843]this[/url].

UP-UP-UPDATE:  The luck factor can only be mitigated through nepotism—as you fall behind and/or are cruelly afflicted by The System you must get busy wheeling and dealing through unrestricted trade.  Don't be shy about greasing palms and maintaining those connections... for only when you find yourself in that place where you have no friends are you truly hosed.

[b]After 15 plays:[/b]  8 --> 7  Start positions are precipitously uneven and unknowable until the game begins, at which point you are either unjustly rewarded or iniquitously punished until it's over.  I still like what it does, it's just that sometimes being the dystopic object lesson—[i]again[/i]—is hard to take.

FINAL ASSESSMENT:  7 --> 6  Wore this out in 17 plays.  Far too much of how the game will go for you lies in which recruits you get in the initial deal:  Pick the same factions as others at the table (especially if you get a pair of a popular faction) who also give you freebies or otherwise enhance the economics of any single die placement and your game will be [i]awesome[/i].  If not, you will lose—good play notwithstanding—to opponents of equal skill who lucked-out with better recruits.  And there's just no good fix for this.  I'll keep it around, but we're done with it for now.

RATING: 7.5
This game is a race to place all 10 of your stars by at various locations on the board, whoever does so first wins. It is a dice worker placement game, but there is little/no blocking in terms of doing an action (you just bump someone off the spot and they get their die back), but in certain spots the amount of pips there slightly affects how many of a resource you collect.

There are 6 "markets" (buildings) that can be built, which is where you will probably try to put 6 of your stars. If you help contribute to building it (one of the listed materials), you get a star there when the building is done. If you did not help, you do not place a star and will receive a random penalty for the rest of the game (whatever is listed on the tile) UNTIL you place a star on that building via a different action. The penalties are generally not crippling (ie: if you ever roll a "1", lose a resource or commodity, etc), but you are best served being sure you are a part of the other buildings than trying to catch up first on buildings you missed out on.

The amount of resources needed to complete a market is based on player count, so there will always be at least one player who does not get a chance to help build the building. However, in a 6 player game, there will be at least 2 people who do not get a chance to help build each market, so it takes longer to place stars, which causes the game to drag. (which is why generally not recommended to play with 6.)

Cleverly themed, interesting to play, maybe a little too showy on the components (I'm very happy about the inclusion of the black-and-white board because it makes teaching this game SO MUCH easier).  I really like the way the factions work; it's very close to being like a stock mechanism without being too obtrusive about it. I also enjoy the cleverness of the areas where the number of dice changes what's produced. The dice are a fun idea and I haven't had them cause an NPE yet, but the potential for it is there...

Euphoria adds a lot of complexity to the dice-rolling worker placement genre, but in my opinion it falls short in the all-important fun factor. No avoiding the obvious comparison to Alien Frontiers, which is a much tighter, more enjoyable game.  Euphoria just seems to make everything difficult to do for the sake of being difficult - commodities must be converted to resources which must be converted to markets which finally get you points, or you have to go through several laborious sequences of steps in order to get cards to get...and so on and so on.  Alien Frontiers also makes the dice rolls more interesting since the roll values have meaning, whereas in Euphoria it's more just about avoiding negative consequences of having high rolls (other than a few specific instances where the roll value matters for placement purposes).  Euphoria isn't a bad game and I would play it again, but I think Alien Frontiers bests it in pretty much every way.

First played this on January 3rd, 2015. There are a lot or rules to get through and it will take at least 1/2 a game to figure out what to do, however by the end you should be ready to play.  There are lots of options and it does seem balanced with skill. There does seem to be one main thing to go for more than others (cards) to spend your 10 stars.

Your goal is to be the first to use your 10 stars.

To do so, you must gain resources and materials to consume your stars.  Did I mention there are lots of options?

This takes a bit longer to play and there is a lot to keep track of, so if you like quick and staitforward games, this isn't it.

Fairly okay game with very innovative mechanisms. However it feels routine as three areas out of four are almost replicas of each other. The thing that will break it out of routine is probably the recruit cards and trying to lay out all your victory points. Would imagine the interaction between players escalating with higher player counts but with 2, it feels bland.

Looks complex but is a simple worker placement where you place one worker die or take them all back.  Resource collection with multiple paths to points.  Mechanic with markets punishes laggards and random dice rolls can give big advantages when you roll doubles (or triples).  Once you grasp the nature of gaining points, plays fast & simple.  Traded this away because the theme is simply pasted on and confuses/isn't interesting.  Other WP games engage me better.

16 October, 2016:  Here's a diarrhoea of thoughts on my very first experience at playing Euphoria today in a 6-player game, which was no where near as euphoric as I had hoped.

I took some issues to this game for several reasons.

First of all, the game board - blimey! - it's like someone vomited everything they could think of and thought "What a brilliant idea!"  Good fricking grief!!!  Don’t get me wrong; It’s nicely designed and relatively pretty to look at, but it’s chaotic and is a clusterf#ck (pardon my french) to look at.  If I had familiarity with the board, it wouldn’t be a problem.  However, for a first timer at this game, I was NOT IMPRESSED.

There were many, many mechanics to remember in this game.  Examples include: If your dice roll plus the location of your knowledge track equals to 16 or higher, you lose a worker.  When you retrieve your workers, you can pay a commodity to increase your hand size or decrease your hand size (unless your hand size is already at 1, which is the lowest).  Or any time you are bumped from a location from another player you must re-roll your die, or dice if you still have unused dice in your pool.  Or if a factory was built but you did not help build it, you have to remember to take your penalty under specific conditions until you’ve fulfilled certain requirements that would help eliminate the penalty.  There were a lot of things going on, and each time we were reminded so frequently (at nearly every 5-6 minutes interval) it feels like we were being nagged.  It makes for an unpleasant experience over the course of the game and, for me, it made me feel snappish at being constantly policed.  It was as though I can’t be trusted to think (because I’m already compromised by having to remember so many nuances in the game).

I enjoy learning a new game (on most days).  And my enjoyment increases exponentially when the flow of the game enhances the learning experience, which means that the game is captivating and I feel involved in it even when it’s someone else’s turn.  In a game like Euphoria where there are many options with an even higher likelihood of analysis-paralysis (in gamers old and new), the SMARTER strategy to introducing this game and many of its’ ilk would be to start with a lower number of players so that new players won’t have to contend with additional players’ chaos on the board and new players won’t have to sit on their thumbs for too long before they forget what they wanted to do when it’s their turn again.  Less players in an introduction game also means less verbal clutter across the table, and less overall time it takes to play the game in its entirety.  I've no doubt that with more experience and familiarity the gameplay can occur in relatively quick succession, even in a 6-player game.

In retrospect, I can’t even say that there were many moments of laughter directly as a result of the game and our direct gameplay interactions with each other.  Any time we had laughed during the game was a result of someone’s verbal brouhaha (i.e. the head tokens used along the knowledge track was verbalised as “going down on the head” until we finally found a more p.c.-friendly phrase).

My overall impression of Euphoria is that the designers wanted to incorporate many game mechanics that they enjoyed but they forgot to STOP, take a step back and think, “This might’ve been overkill” or “We need to scale this back a bit.”  This is not a good entry game at all;  This is a game you want to bring to the table if you don’t mind one to five people holding a grudge against you for the next 12-months, at minimum.  Despite my reservations about Euphoria, I would CAUTIOUSLY give this game another chance.  Depending on my mood, I might need to be bribed.

One play, and on skimming the fora it seems we may have been mistaught a few rules (in particular, we missed the ability to place a star on a building after it's been built). I'd be willing to try again with the correct rules but the base mechanic doesn't excite me enough to request it.

Not convinced at all on this one, there is no engine building in the normal euro sense, instead there is getting more workers and getting access to my workers faction abilities.

The higher the player count, the less chance that one player will be stuck with a worker from a faction that no one else cares about, and thus not get any help on the reputation track for the star at the end of it. This game is definitely best with 5/6 players without increasing the game length significantly.

Edit: after a few plays, it's not my favourite, but I'm keeping it around because it's interesting, different from other games, and is best 5/6 player

RATING: 7
Euphoria is a solid worker placement game with some very interesting mechanisms, including the metagame of figuring out which player has an interest in advancing factions that benefit oneself, the ability to use occupied spots if willing to return a worker back to the player who occupies said spots, and the luck-pushing mechanism that arises when attempting to acquire and keep more workers.  Combine these unique twists with an offbeat theme and the result is an interesting spin on traditional worker placement.

I found there to be too much luck involved in the game.  The initial recruit cards have powers that are not even.  Rolling the dice can be wildly lucky - one person can roll 3 dice and get a pair or trips, while another person could lose a die.  I thought there was too much downtime between your turns.

Get resources, turn them into other resources, then turn them into other resources, and eventually turn them into victory points.  Instead of meeples for worker placement, you use d6s with fancy pips.  Sometimes you want to roll high and sometimes you want to roll low.  Rolling duplicates is usually best.  You can lose a die if you roll too high.  I would probably play it again sometime, but I turned down an opportunity to play it again a short time after my first play.

like Lewis & Clark, it's a "race" game where you are trying to be the 1st to get rid of your 10 star shaped bits... and game ends abruptly... would make more sense to me if everyone at least got either an equal number of turns (ie. keep track of start player) or give all other players one more turn after one player reached the goal...

Then it just comes down to luck of the draw and hoping that the other players chose the same side as you out of the Energy and Water guys.

After 9 plays: I do enjoy this game. The mechanic is still novel and interesting and the theme intriguingly immersive. It often seems like it should feel like it's just math, but I feel like I'm really working towards some sort of coup. I'm impressed. It's title of new favourite was quickly usurped by Mage Wars, but that's a big challenge to go up against. I still like it immensely.

First feelings: Having only played this game once and with only two players, I don't want to jump the gun but I am having a really difficult time not saying that it's my new favourite game and I love it. The game took us an abnormally long amount of time, but we didn't really want it to stop. The mechanic is so interesting and novel. The turns are fast, except when you get caught in AP. I'm looking forward to playing it again and if it hadn't been nearly 3 am when we finished, I might have suggested that we do. I can't wait to introduce everyone to it.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (February 2014)

After the explanation, I had high hopes for the game, sadly my expectations were utterly crushed. Euphoria is a pretty boardgame, with some thematic touches that are very nice. Loved the text on the Ethical Dilemma cards, the art is great. It has cool dice (although I thought they were custom dice, instead they are regulars D6s with pretty gears on them) and great graphic design. The games flows quickly with 4 players. The rules are fairly easy to grasp and the great board design helps a lot to understand the game. I like the resource components and even liked the spreadsheet to multiply and track your resources.

What kills it for me, is the incredible amount of uncontrollable luck (for a supposedly strategy game) you get in the game. Beginning with the pair rule, why should I gain an action if I rolled a pair (trio, poker, etc.) This is very unfair, I know that if I roll more dice I have a better probability to achieve this, but I still rank it as very unfair. Also hate the luck with the artifacts, if I draw a couple of them I can do many powerful actions when other players need 3 to do the same. The recruits powers are very unbalanced, and it is luck if you get a good one or not. Worst of all are the buildings, as they are face down you don’t know which ones are powerful, the negative effects of some buildings are very damaging. Even if the buildings were face up, some player will get hosed more by luck than by skill (player order, if I roll pairs, etc.) and be left out of that building. The knowledge (amount of rolled dice) doesn’t seem very relevant, they are only used on the mines and to see if I lose a worker. Almost never this is a real consideration and you can always use them (without any regard to the level of knowledge) as you wish (no tension, pure luck). The game punishes you if you have more than 3 workers as you will probably lose them, so I almost never will take back more than 3 workers. My point is, that it is (almost) completely irrelevant what numbers do you roll on your dice (except when you roll pairs :(). You have available a lot of dice spaces, but you always use the same few ones, ,meaning, it has no interesting decisions. 

The ethical dilemma cards are cool, but there is no really a motivation to choose the recruit over the VP, I know some times it will be valuable (if you managed to draw a very powerful recruit) but most times it makes more sense to get the VP, also it is pure luck if you get a good recruit (or an advanced one) or not.

Bottom line, Euphoria is a gorgeous luck fest, that it is way too long for what it offers. There is no tension whatsoever and the luckiest player will win as most decisions are obvious. Perhaps the worst dice/strategy game I have ever played. I hope the person who explained the game to me made a lot of mistakes, otherwise I won’t ever play this luck fest again. I’m rating it highly due to its great components.

This is a very preliminary rating, after only one 2 player game. Euphoria is a pretty good worker placement game with a nice twist on the mechanic. There's no "blocking" per se, but you taking an occupied space can sometimes the opponent who was already there. The strategy in the game is really wide open; there are many possible paths to victory, but each path bears a strong resemblance to all of the others. I suspect that this is another game that shines with more players, but I still enjoyed it with 2, and I'm looking forward to playing it again.

Update: I have since played this with 6 players and I do think it plays much better at higher player counts. The lack of blocking eliminates any kind of real tension, at least until the end of the game when everyone is closing in on victory. It absolutely feels like a race. I can't say my rating has gone up, but I do want to play it some more.

Nice game with some interesting ideas.  I would rate it much higher if it weren't for one fatal flaw.  And I do mean fatal.

At the beginning everyone secretly chooses two of four recruits dealt to them. Each recruit has an allegiance to one of four areas.  Players who, by random chance, choose recruits from the same areas will inevitably help each other by working towards the same goals, while players who, by random chance, choose recruits from areas different than those chosen by others will find themselves working alone and have no hope of victory.  In other words, you can literally lose this game by your choice of recruits before the start, with no relevant information to guide your choices.  This kills the game from the start, and for that reason alone I won't be playing it again.

Good game, but not as good as Viticulture (or Kingsburg/AF). The idea of the buildings is fine, but some of them are too punishing if you are unlucky. I think I have to try without the buildings that makes you loose dice if you roll a certain number. The other buildings can be worked around (or worked on), but if you roll bad, you are just set back.

I imagine the idea for Euphoria started over a game of Agricola, where one player said, "What if these workers were DICE? Wouldn't that be cool??" Well, no it isn't. Not the way it was implemented. The idea is that you roll your workers every time you collect them and if you roll over a certain amount, then you lose one. That's all the values accomplish. That's it. The publisher seems to have built an entire theme around that idea, calling the pips "knowledge" and that too much knowledge is dangerous and makes your workers disappear. However in reality, knowledge is something that is gained and added to over time, not randomly determined every time you wake up. Almost everything about this game feels cobbled-together or tacked-on to the point of annoyance.

This is a game of small, incremental advancements in order to be the first player to get 10 points. The game plods along as you place a single die and accomplish something small every turn. The turns are quick, at least. The only real tension in the game is whether you will lose a worker when you roll the dice. Otherwise, the usual tension of worker placement games (taking an action before somebody else can) is gone since you can simply bump anybody you want out of most spaces. There are action spaces that are built throughout the game, giving more opportunities for points. However, if you didn't contribute to the building of a space, something bad, sometimes REAL bad, happens to you. Usually it takes the form of restricting you in some way ("loose a resource when you roll X", or "you no longer get allegiance bonuses of the 1st or 2nd tier"). These restrictions are more depressing than interesting. You won't know how bad a tile is until it is turned over, so pray you contribute to the right tiles, because there is no way to know.

For a game that has the trappings of strategy, there is far too much random bad stuff that can happen TO you and no tension in the action selection mechanisms. I find myself at the mercy of the game, much as my dice do when I order them to go mine some bliss. They should just use their intelligence and tell me to screw off.

RATING: 6
A worker placement game with some particularities like the teme or the need of knowing the total amount of your dices, that make it different but also more unpredictable and chaotic.  Anyway it lacks a real interaction between players, deficiency that is usual in eurogames but not in those that look for an atmosphere.
The game has been published after a very worked crowdfounding campaign that has made possible its amazing components, but lately it is overproduced, and after all the board and the dices are not clear.

Interesting game. Excellent components. Like the dice mechanics and the method of determining a winner. First going out --a refreshing change from victory points.

Played again with 5 people yesterday. Can drag when there's a lot of AP. Game kind of left me cold second time around. There can be a number of exceptions to keep track of with the markets and ability cards.

Listened to the hype and boy was I fooled. I understand why new gamers would like it and I would have loved it when I first got back into gaming in 2003.  However there are just so many better games than this undercooked game with great components ( I think this is why many people love this game).  Several Fatal flaws; random buildings that one helps build but one doesn't know the building or the benefits until it is built.  Some of the buildings have brutal penalties if you don't help build them can't buy certain goods, can't visit certain areas, lose goods if you roll a 3 (what random nonsense) while other buildings penalties seem very tame.  You could pick six builds randomly that help one or two factions and not the others and the lack of balance means if you picked the wrong faction from the beginning of the game you can be hosed. 

 just a few other problems include major card balance issues (some cards are just way too powerful endgame cards that allow a player to place two stars with one action.). Getting extra workers requires water or electricity which benefits two factions that get bonuses when selecting water or electricity.  
Laughable that people call this a deep game. No way.

This needed more play testing by experienced gamers with hundreds of games under their belt.  I have played four times and will try some more but boy I would be excited to trade this bore.  

This is the last straw no more kickstarter games until I play them first.

RATING: 6.5
You gather resources to spend on activating different ways of getting rid of your starting ten victory points. I really liked the art on the board. I didn't like that only one player was always left out of buying certain spaces to get rid of stars. These spaces also penalyzed you. You could spend extra actions to put the star in, but those are extra actions. So it was easy to get behind early. The dice did add some additional strategy, but sometimes they seemed to add too much luck and annoyance. Finally the game seemed really abstract such that it felt like moving around resources for little purpose.

RATING: 5
The professionality of Jamey Stegmaier in setting up this Kickstarter convinced me to back my first and so far only project. In terms of production value and on-time-delivery this is an A+. When it comes to gameplay value, it's more of a mixed bag. Euphoria has seen development and still is taken care of with minor adjustments to the rules. It's not a shipwreck like most other Kickstarter games I have played before. But it clearly doesn't have a professional level of development. It's also a noticeably American take on Eurogames in its randomness.
The main offender is the importance of the allegiance tracks for winning. Players sharing an allegiance and jointly promoting the track will have a major advantage to others left alone with an allegiance. The decision to focus on the action areas of your allegiances is too obvious to be interesting. The problem is that the choice of allegiance for the biggest part is done secretly at game start not leaving much room to compensate being stuck alone.
The game can be unbalanced even more from the start by noticeably differing powers of the recruits. Within the game, unlucky dice rolls (losing workers, not getting doubles) can further skew the game without much influence for the players. This all would be fine within the announced 60 minutes playtime but our play lasted more than 2 hours with four players.
Still, I'll play again. There are a few elements interesting enough such as the shared building of markets or a real decision whether to invest in additional workers that might be lost again. The material of the resources also entices to be played with.

[b]First Impressions:[/b] I played a two player game and enjoyed it. I feel more depth and enjoyment would come with more players though, which is really saying something, as I enjoyed the first game.

[b]7/24/2014 Update[/b] 
After playing with more people, I've come up with some observations.

First, the game starts off feeling very unguided and slow. As the game grows, the pace starts to pick up. But by the time the game is over, it feels like the game went on about 30 minutes longer than it should have.

The game is also a little too fiddly. It's difficult to always keep track of all the things that can shift and change, even though 3 of the 4 factions all work in a similar way, it all adds up to a lot of things you need to keep track of, making it feel very fiddly.

But yet - it's still a very fun game.

I am definitely not a fan of the theme, which is obviously designed to be somewhat whimsical, but which seems heavy-handed to me. My main problem with the game, though, is in the die-rolling, which in our game dealt too severe of a blow to players that lost workers due to an unlucky roll. I see how it is designed to mitigate greed, but when a die roll effectively takes you out of contention in what is too long of a game, it's just not fun. It is evident from playing that this is a Kickstarter game - the people behind it are evidently enthusiastic, but I feel that it lacks polish and development.

Update with newly-received Supreme edition: the final game improves upon the PnP in many ways: better balance, better explanations, and components that rival the collector's edition of classic games. I didn't win but still really enjoyed playing, and we will enjoy it for many years to come.

RATING: 7
What a marriage of worker placement and dice rolling. Unlike Alien Frontiers the workers have a different but still interesting mechanic and I think the game requires a certain type of personality to enjoy the dystopian setting in its many hidden humorous winks and nudges.
I really like the design, even though the board and all its components seem very overloaded and there is just too much going on which result in information overload. However, after a few plays you can actually start out with a strategy.
As with many worker placement games you need to know this game in order to enjoy it and understand its deeper strategic elements (even though dice rolling is involved) - there are some minor flaws which can lead to a premature ending if you don't recognize what another player is going for and the markets can screw you over if you go last and didn't notice when the rush for building them has started. Aside from that - a solid game with a whacky theme.

Good example of a typical Stonemaier production, i. e. mechanically solid euro game with neat components. I am not a fan of the "be the first to gain X of a thing and you'll win the game" and I didn't like it in Euphoria either. Jamey Stegmaier used the star dropping mechanism to better end with Scythe. Here you just have a very slowly moving game that thankfully is so clear that there isn't that much AP proneness included. Theme is splendid, especially the worker smartness part of it, but it doesn't really shine through the mechanical structure of the game. In the end playing Euphoria is not a waste of time, but it still lasts a bit too long for what it is.

Worker placement and resource conversion game. Rather than engine building there's a focus on spamming a small set of actions as dictated by variable player powers and periodically securing contributions to resource pools. Player interaction is otherwise somewhat incidental. For a game where you race to a comparatively small number of victory points there's a notable degree of seemingly unmotivated randomness; if I were to play again I would lobby to remove some of that. The theme didn't make itself felt beyond the fact that there are four futuristic factions and fruit. I don't know, it just feels like if Reiner Knizia had done this he'd have distilled everything that's genuinely interesting about it into one or two simple but meaningful processes - and then everyone would dismiss it as a filler.

Worker placement game with some push-your-luck, some meta aspects to your moves and loads of resources/commodities.
There are some weird restrictions in place with worker types which can make some resources quite scarce.
It took a while to really get running but that may just be due to the player.
I did have one minor gripe with the game: a lot of the recruits just are not very exciting. If you get a bit of a bad draw then you'll probably go "eeeeeeeh... *deflates*"

Some good stuff: dice displacement, you need to know when to play your dice to be recovered without an action; and worker pile, sum the value of previously placed workers.
And lots of bad stuff: low impact of high valued dice, too much resources, no space for creative plays (structured gameplay: resources > upgrade > build), unbalanced characters, high luck (card draw and die roll in general: doubles and losing workers).
The result is a slow paced game, due to all the restrictions and punishment for having more workers. Played with 5-players, which increases the downtime... Did not enjoyed very much.

So it's great if you and your significant other just want a quick fun hour of competitiveness...as long as the other half doesn't play dirty then it will be fun,otherwise it can defer into a not so enjoying game, leaving the one losing wanting to quit before the game is over. All in all its a enjoyable game that takes a bit of strategy but plays quickly and has tons of replayability

We have played Euphoria quite a few times, and

In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.

Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge—that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.

Heavy Euro Dice placing. I like the mechanic of knocking someone off the board as a strategic element. The components are great and setting is cool (I'm a fan of 1984, Brave New World, Gattaca, Equilibrium, The Island etc.). Must admit that I can't play it with everyone but when its played it guarantees to be one great evening. :)

RATING: 4.5
somewhat interesting dystopian thematic touches and trending mechanism ideas (dice instead of workers; taking back your workers is a separate action; your workers can be kicked from the spaces they were placed to, so you get them back and can re-use them etc.). Has some fine ideas but isn't a clear nor an elegant design - and it seems just too much depends on luck. Luck of the dice you roll (you can lose workers because of a bad roll; when rolling double you can have two actions in one turn etc.), luck of the item cards you draw (you need certain cards for certain aims or two similar items but there are six different items and a low hand limit), luck of the aim cards you draw (they seem rather imbalanced) and even some luck in the marketplace tiles built. As it's a game where (just like in simpler games like Settlers of Catan) you play until someone reaches 10 points and it's more luck-dependent than Catan, this thing is just way too complex for this. Oh, and also the four differet areas on the board are rather samey, uninspired and interchangeable (very unlike the four tracks of Russian Railroads for example). I think right now this is my least favorite 2013 game.

First Impression:

Another enjoyable take on worker placement by Stonemaier Games!  Pretty simple in that you either place a worker and take the action or you return all your workers.  There's just a couple of interesting catches.  On returning workers, you roll your workers and if they total 16 or more, you lose a worker since they became too smart.  On placement, you can often kick people out to take a unique action allowing them or delaying them on rolling their dice, if you roll doubles, you can can place both your workers in the same turn, and in some cases the sum of the dice determine how much you acquire.  Recruits give you special actions and usually extra bonuses as well.  Fun game!  

Be aware that if you don't help build the markets, you may be hurting.  If you don't contribute towards building a market, each of the six buildings have a penalty that is in effect for the rest of the game until you get a star on the market in a different way.

Really enjoy the game. It's not trivial to explain and what I really like about this game is that there is no obvious strategy and there is always something to do

Worker placement game that's a little too friendly with its worker placement.  There's no real denial of actions since you can just bump people.  There are also some prizes you can invest in which penalize people who don't invest... but then the penalized people can just pay to ignore the penalty.  Much too friendly for this mode of game.  The actual engine of the game is mostly exchanging cubes for different cubes--little compelling theme or narrative.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A wide-open worker placement game that I think suffers from a lack of focus. There are some quasi-cooperative aspects (building new worker spaces) that really hammer players who don't cooperate with ongoing penalties, and it's very easy for a player to get caught behind the curve clearing one penalty while his opponents build the next thing and impose a new penalty.

Of the four board factions, the fluffy-drug-cloud folks seem to have the most flexibility in their actions, which makes their spaces consequently more popular, which makes their cards more valuable. Get dealt those early and you've probably got a leg up. I'll admit that this could be largely a function of group-think.

Finally, the resource push-pull of being able to lose dice means that engine building isn't rewarded. This is an interesting variation on most worker placement games, but ultimately I find it underwhelming. Victory is achieved by doing any number of various things, but win or lose, I can't look at the board, or even my stuff, and feel like I've accomplished anything. Dystopia in boardgame form? Maybe.

Played at CotC '14.  Wow, this is such a great worker placement game to start people with.  There's no clean-up, bureaucracy, add resources, take your workers home phases, it just goes round and around and players either place a worker or pay a nominal cost to remove any number of them.  Just a great little game, neat mechanics, not that bad to teach once you get a handle on it.

Traded Archipelago for this on here.  EVEN BETTER it was the Kickstarter version, so includes the upgrade allegiance stars and resources.

Bought the GameTrayz for this in the beginning of 2016, was worthwhile since they had a sale.

Traded away at Origins'16 since the group seemed to kinda be over it. Great for introducing newer players to worker placement, but when do I actually get to break out longer games with anyone but the regulars anymore anyways?

Playing this game, i felt like an operator in a process control room. Overwhelming board. Game is not bad, but very typical Euro. 

Rather abstract and difficult to get a hold on. In essence it's collecting resources and converting them into points. But the number of options is overwhelming and the relationship between these options is not so easy to find out in a first play.

The game needed a lot of starting up time, before the engines started running and stars could be disposed of.

Typically a game you need to play more than once, but i'm not sure if that will ever happen. Game fun is low. This is for people that like details and complexity. Not for me. 

Gold and brick blocks are really neat (only with kickstarter edition, so it seems). But these gadgets cannot make up for the chaotic board.

The power of the cards you draw seem to have a huge impact on your chances to win the game.

Theme? What theme? This is a "pure mechanism" game. Brain activity without fun.

A very interesting worker placement - I'm still trying to grasp the flow of the game. Fun with 2p, only played once with 4, but it seemed more interesting.

I need to play this a few more times, but I suspect this game is much better with more than two.

I'm torn about keeping it for that reason. I don't tend to keep a lot of games that don't play well with two. What keeps me from getting rid of it is the bumping mechanism where someone can go where you are and it gets you your worker dice back. That's cool. I wish someone would do that in a game that works better with two.

After a handful of initial plays upon arrival from Kickstarter, this game has sat on the shelf. When selling it recently, I tried to work out why. I think the answer lies in the failure to carry the theme through. An odd comment as theme seems to be everywhere - everywhere except maybe in the feel of the game. The (great) idea of workers gaining knowledge is dealt with in a very abstract way and the sense of doing something subversive or dangerous didn't grip me. There is a great deal to love here and I would want to play it again at some point but it never leapt of the shelf into my arms and thus got canned. From Stonemeier games I will always go with Viticulture/Tuscany, their real masterpiece to date.

Deluxe Kickstarter Edition.

Excellent components. Solid game. It definitely takes a game to wrap your head around the mechanisms. To be sure, after my wife read me the rules, and I looked out at the board for the first time, I felt completely lost. There's a lot to keep track of, and it's just so different. I think I like it for the following reasons, in order: 

1. Components
2. Originality
3. Gameplay

To be fair, I've only played with 2, and I imagine it is much better with more. The whole "bumping" mechanic really necessitates 4 or more players. Overall, a very good game, one that I'll hold onto for a while, despite its rather large footprint.

There's luck and there's variability. Euphoria has a lot of luck and not much variability. While losing a worker on a high roll is thematic, in practice, it just means roll bad and you lose three turns. Same thing with the cards and the buildings. Don't draw the cards that match the buildings you are looking for? Oh well, I guess you lose. It's okay - it's not a terrible game. But why play this when there are so many great worker placement games out there?

OK, so this is the weirdest game ever! I takes me forever to teach and to make sure that the players grok it (I have on player who just doesn't grok it at all and won't play it because of that). My first games take 2-3 hours depending on the players and the player count, but with experienced players I can get a 5-player game done in around an hour!

I really enjoy (but am crap at) this game: I like dice placement games and games that have dice mitigation (or where the numbers rolled don't matter critically) and I really like the interlocking "engine" elements. However, there are definitely some areas of the game where it's possible to see who will win quite early on as there are some synergies that can arise that are unstoppable. I'm looking forward to the expansion and the way that it is attempting to fix some of those aspects of the game.

Interesting use of dice as workers where you want them to be high-value because they produce more when you send them to work but you risk losing them when they are too high in value.  Faction track system is also interesting although potentially unbalanced in 3p+ games if one player is odd man out trying to push a particular faction while other players collaborate on other factions.  Regardless it's a fun resource management puzzle that I'll play anytime.

Have to knock it down to below 7 because of the random dice roll. Even with risk mitigation (keeping Knowledge low), I still find the removal of workers and double placement (if same pips) too strong. The tribal tracks are also not balanced enough for my taste in a 2p game. I would rate it even lower to a 6, but the mechanism of worker placement with bumping is solid. Quality production - not for me.

Lackluster first play with three players. Seems as though it would play much better with 4-5. Regardless, the theme is not immersive and gameplay is not what one would expect from a worker placement game. Since workers can be bumped there is little fighting for spaces on the board and it becomes a resource management and timing game. It is no Viticulture.

The theme does nothing for me. Game play itself is just like any other worker placer, no new mechanics. Nevertheless, an enjoyable game to have played, points generation/star placement accellerates towards the end. Way overrated and overhyped here, IMHO.

(Typical case of the KS-effect: kickstarter backers rated this game already with tens way before its release, so without having played it. As a consequence, enthusiastic gamers that don't look any further than the average will back the game too. In this manner all the stretch goals will be reached because of a collectively created hype. It's a simple but effective mechanism for the first backers to get a box maximized full with stretchgoals.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
What seems initially like an over-busy (seriously, there is a LOT happening on this board) worker placement game, quickly shows itself as an over-busy worker placement game with some compelling hooks.

One of those hooks is using 'dynamic workers' via a rolled d6 (rather than a static meeple or pawn). This creates a light element of luck and forces you to react to your rolls, as they may change the outcome of some of your actions.

This leads to the most interesting aspect of the game - workers can become too intelligent for their own good and may defect. In most worker placement games, building your engine quickly is often the key to victory. Efficiency and economy of action is paramount in gathering more resources than your opponents.

While that is the case in Euphoria, as those workers will produce more resources, more intelligent workers will also see the dystopian hellscape to which they belong and will leave for greener pastures, forcing you to be out of a potential action until a new cog is shocked or drenched awake.

Because this game takes some expectations of the genre and style and subverts them, this is definitely a game for genre veterans. Newcomers to worker placement style games may feel overwhelmed at the sheer amount of stuff to do and keep track of and may dislike the dynamic worker mechanic and the feeling of 'punishment for doing well' that it can cause.

Was relatively easy to pick up and understand. Our first game suffered from a runaway leader problem with one of the worker card's special abilities, but that seems like it was more an exception to the rule and can probably be avoided by removing that card and/or similar ones.

As far as dice worker placement games go, I *think* I still like Alien Frontiers better, but this easily has the chance to move past it as my dice worker game of choice with a few more plays and figuring out the nuances and strategies. Lots of options and paths to victory, and I really like that in a game. Very nice mix and balance of resources and cards and I like the way it all works together. A very well thought out game.

Well, the game had promisewith a great theme andnice ideas, but ultimately fell just short, and in not fulfilling it's promises ended up taking an extra hit in my rating, fair or not.  When I first heard of the game I thought it sounded great: moral dilemmas?  Trying to keep you people in check, but sometimes they could rebel?  Sign me on!  However, all the cool ideas are wasted in generic Euro mechanics and the whole theme of the game is lost in this resource collecting, worker placement disappointment.  The what could have been fascinating dilemmas are simply a card played using resources, and choosing a victory point or an extra card.  That's it: no other ramifications or game effects.  Every once in a while you roll too high and a worker goes away.  That's it.  I thought there would be the feeling of a great struggle, leaders versus populace, but you only get a hard to read board and a Euro point scoring exercise.  Too bad.

Not sure how great this game is but despite many of the familiar mechanics there's a uniqueness about it that I enjoy. Dice are rolled and then used in worker-placement actions. You can gain more dice (workers) but they can be taken away if you roll to high. There's also a little bit of a stock-like game of working together to complete goals. Areas need to be built with dice and if you go in alone you'll find your workers tied up. When areas are built they provide extra ways to collect VPs but punish those that did not contribute so timing and paying attention to your opponent's resources is important.

The dystopian theme isn't extremely strong but it's present. Knowledge and heart need to be balanced. Too much knowledge can be dangerous in this world.

"The use of dice will usually deter me from liking a game, but I think the randomness of the dice in Euphoria is as good as Troyes. ... In most cases, high and low rolls are equivalently useful and effective

Dice game that's good for crappy rolls? Euphoria is kind of like that. It's really a worker placement game and the dice are the workers. In short Euphoria is a risk management worker placement game. You don't want your rolls too high because you workers will run away. But the way you can manipulate values or lessen risk is very easy to grasp and fits thematically well. The seem is you are an oppressor and you want to be the best oppressor of the game. The games play time and player counts fit very well and scale well to the table size. Its not too heavy but does scratch that heavy game itch. The dice in this game are beautiful and the high player count is awesome. I just wish i had the super fancy Kickstarter components but I'm very happy still with the standard components mine came with.

Super cool theme, reminds me of the book brave new world. Components are off the charts, really good. The game itself was a bit of a letdown. It is not bad at all, but in the end it is basic worker placement. It had too little interaction and offers too few interesting / hard choices. After one game I realised that there are no different strategies to employ the second time. The game would be different in small ways, but overall the same. Once was enough for me.

Fun dice worker placement that suffers from an unclear board with small text and vague colors. Hard to see what you can do in a turn.

Positives:
- very good worker placement game with lots of strategic avenues
- thematic to a degree 
- various elements of luck that usually balance each other out

Negatives
- poor design in starting cards, which despite a draft can still screw you over
SOLUTION: Perhaps instead of 4 random cards for the draft, start with 2 early game cards and 2 late game cards and then do a draft, somehow
- poor design in penalties on closed markets as people not involved in those markets (the people who will logically also not be following that building) get punished
- solution: open buildings/markets and they should give bonuses rather than penalties, rewarding people who helped build them rather than punishing others

I have played a four player game with friends later that week and really enjoyed it. The game played very well and there was some pretty interesting decisions around worker placement and the scramble to be ‘in’ or, rather, ‘not out’, when a building is finished is also quite engaging. The components are very good, but several of my little lightning bolts have bits falling off the end due, I think, to the wood grain. For a simple to learn game there is a fair bit going on and plenty of interesting choices to be made when there are three other players.

We played two player later the same evening but the experience was a little flatter as there didn’t seem to be any real competition for resources and as we weren’t really doing that much (two tunnels didn’t even get started) in each other’s respective spheres of influence so there wasn’t too much ‘bumping’ of opponent’s dice. Buildings were also built late after we achieved parity in influence in each of the four spheres. It was an okay experience, but based on the one play the game does not shine with two, hence only a rating of 7.

That said, I am pretty happy to have this game and see it getting a bit of use in the future; probably when I have four to six willing players. Well worth considering if any of this sounds your cup of cha.

UPDATE:

Have the extra cards from the Stonemaier  games Treasure box.

Supported on Kickstarter. Great components, interesting gameplay. Some of my friends like it, and some are lukewarm to it.

May 2014 - Reduced rating from 9 to 8. I still enjoy the game, but can't seem to develop any winning strategies. The game seems to suffer a bit when new players take actions that continue to benefit players who are clearly ahead.

Dice/worker placement game with a few different paths to follow, which is mostly dependent on what characters you draw in the beginning. Some spaces allow for multiple dice in the same space and produce resources based on the total value of the dice, while others are spaces for only one die but can be replaced. Very fun game.

This game is a "do this to do that to do that..." Game where you build a chain of actions, swapping resources etc. in order to meet the victory conditions.
It feels a bit fiddly on first play through as there are so many different things going on but the actions you can perform are either to place a worker or remove worker(s) making turns quick.
Typical of Stegmaier Games the production quality is completely OTT which does add more feel to the game. Personally, I would prefer to play with normal d6 as the graphics on the supplied dice are not instantly clear.
I need to play it again to see what I really think about the game and if there is anything in it to make it rise above other chain builders.

Picked up a copy since it had been a couple of years since I played it. I liked it less this time, though as far as cube pushers and proper games that support up to 6 people go, Euphoria is one of the best. The buildup is very slow and prodding, but I do like that there is a substantial arc there. Despite this, Euphoria is most definitely still a cube pusher, and cube pushers don't really fascinate me. It has a cool theme, and I like how the different aspects of the game help to illustrate this world the game takes place in, but it just isn't quite as enjoyable as I'd like it to be for it to stick around. If Euphoria could get the Tuscany treatment, I have a feeling it might be worth revisiting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Euphoria is a hybrid that's difficult to assess. On one hand, it's a traditional worker placement game, where you use workers to acquire and upgrade resources and exchange them for victory points. On the other hand it has been completed with some interesting elements, such as the player cooperation to dig tunnels and open markets to further common factions, and some less interesting elements, such as die rolls to keep workers and card drawings to build sets.

It feels like some mechanisms, like the the worker knowledge levels (increases randomly and gives risk with little return) and the ethical dilemmas (affect only the player's hand, not the overall game) could have been utilized better.

With few players there seems to be too little room for cooperation and too much room for workers, something that gives luck to much influence. With more players, it's possible that trades and intrigues create more tension and interesting decisions. The production value and the fact that it plays 6 players in a relatively short playing time makes it keeper for now.

I rate the official game a 6 but my personal variant an 7 - take it or leave it. To mitigate the luck and make the worker knowledge ethical dilemmas more interesting, I have added the following rules:

1. Instead of rolling retrieved workers, give them +1. In addition to the collective knowledge check of ≥16, there is an individual knowledge check of ≥7. (Rationale: Workers' learn from their work. Players can plan to modify the workers' intellect before it's too late.)
1a. Starting workers have a total value of 7 (player's choice).
1b. New workers get value 1.
1c. A player's last worker can never get knowledge >6
1d. Recruits and markets referring to die rolls are not used.

2. Instead of using the knowledge track, change individual workers, e.g. +2 knowledge results in 1 worker getting +2 or 2 workers getting +1 each. (Rationale: Workers are dumb but some workers are more dumb than others. Players can choose a knowledge distribution that serves their strategies.)

3. When a worker bumps another worker, the smarter worker gets -1 and the dumber worker gets +1. (Rationale: Workers' intellect is influenced by their company. Players can block attractive actions with smart workers and bump dumb workers.)

4. Instead of drawing unknown artifacts, always keep the 3 top cards face up. Workers with knowledge 1-3 must pick the 1st, workers with knowledge 4-5 may pick the 1st or the 2nd and workers with 6 may pick any. (Rationale: The smarter the worker, the better he searches. Players with smart workers gets an extra benefit to compensate for the risk.)

5. When a player uses an artifact to complete an ethical dilemma, place it face up on the dilemma card to remember. When the specific artifact is drawn again, immediately discard it and get morale +5 (if the choice was to fight the dystopia) or knowledge -5 (if the choice was to contribute to the dystopia).  (Rationale: The artifact is now used to pursue the destiny chosen in the ethical dilemma. This also serves to mitigate the higher worker turnaround due to rule 1.)

Update: Sold because die rolls that you cannot mitigate simply have no place in modern board games.

Euphoria's gameplay is a combination of Alien Frontiers and the Manhattan Project except the dice rolls are basically meaningless and retrieval has a cost.

The game seems needlessly complicated. The basic formula of a worker placement game, (place workers, gain resources, convert resources into victory points), has been multiplied by 3, or in some cases 4. This was probably done to make Euphoria playable with a greater number of players than most worker placement games.

This is a worker-placement-race game where your workers are actually dice....representing their intelligence. 

There are four different factions that have a few different abilities to them.  The trick is you are part of two different factions, but only one is activated at the beginning.  You can use a few different abilities on the board that will allow you to eventually reveal your second faction that will open some more opportunities down the line.

You get 10 stars, you win.

Not sure this one quite lives up to the raves I've heard. There is kind of an arduous arc to the game -- takes a long time to get any VPs (which, in a twist, come from discarding Lucky Charms-inspired stars) -- then there's a ramping period of VP accumulation -- then, like in 4-player Catan, a period of searching and searching to get the final 2 VPs. At least that was my experience. There is some well thought-out supply chaining in the mix of resources -- but maybe I'm a bit tired of the convert-resources-into-other-resources-or-VPs shtick -- and some interesting mechanics having to do with allies (boosting them, and trying to uncover your secret ally) -- but by mid/late game, all allies will be uncoverable, and most allies will have the benefit of being a star dump. With the dice-as-workers trope in effect, Euphoria's elevator pitch might be "super-Eurofied Alien Frontiers." It's a good game, but while I'm a fan of games with an arc, I think the long ramp-up time and somewhat scripted nature of this particular arc takes down the fundensity a bit.

We really enjoyed our first play. It lasted 3 hours (almost one hour of explanation) for 6 players, but if it can really be played under 1 hour, it would be a huge hit for me.  

Up to now, I've played 5 and 6 player games that have been played in under 2 hours. They didn't feel long, but neither short (also, players were noob to the rules).

The game is not terribly deep, but it's deeper than I thought. 

There's a lot of interaction -not confrontation- in many ways.

The luck factor is not as big as I thought (though I guess in some games some players could always be extra-lucky when rolling doubles).

I have the deluxe version and the components are top-nocht, of course. Probably my best looking game.

My concerns: balance: 
+Are Icarite recruits more powerful than others? They seem to score easily because their actions are highly desirable (especially the bar action).
+The bar action seem to be overpowered (especially if you have an Icarite recruit) you can do it once every 6 actions [assuming 2 workers only, 4 cards, 6 moral and your 2 recruits factions with bonus in phase 1 at least: action 1: 2/3 bliss [min]; action 2: 2/3 other commodity [min]; action 3: retrieve; action 4: bar; action 5 score; action 6, retrieve workers.
+Is it balanced with less than 6 players? Markets were not heavily used with 5-6 players, it seems even more difficult to complete with less players... Doesn't seem to be worth.

***************
Updates about issues (I have played with 2 different groups):
The markets have always been built very scarcely. It's surprising, because they are quite cheap (1 point point per resource). This doesn't concern me very much.
In my third game (CLBSK), the icarites markets were used scarcely. In the 2 previous ones, they were abused, especially the bar that gives you 2 cards.
*************
New update: With 2-3 players, all markets get built pretty soon, and the game lenght decreases a lot, to 1 hour. I enjoyed much more these games.

*************

As for the rating, I start with an 8, and 0,5 more for the components. I will increase it if my concerns turn to out be false and the real playing time with 4 players is 1 hour or less. I will reduce if my balance concerns are justified.

Gioco molto particolare e molto più lungo di quanto indicato sulla scatola (60'?). Piazzamento lavoratori i quali devono però devono rimanere nell'ignoranza e non comprendere che li state sfruttando, altrimenti scapperanno. Con questa idea di fondo il gioco, che regala molta interazione, viene governato dal lancio dei dadi e dalla pesca delle carte; malgrado ciò il tutto risulta ben mischiato e comunque godibile. Le meccaniche appariranno presto abbastanza semplici ma riuscire a posizionare le 10 stelline, obiettivo per poter vincere, è tutt'altro che semplice. La partita in 6 giocatori risulta oltremisura lenta e ricca di tempi morti ma questo è forse l'unico vero difetto, a parte ovviamente al lancio dei dadi che, come a Monopoli, se risultano doppi permettono di fare un doppio turno. Gioco da provare.

RATING: 2
A rather obvious and out-of-control dice placement activity - I hesitate to actually call it a game, because of the lack of interaction and competitiveness. Massive luck factor and a bizarre and largely nonsensical theme: say what you like about building medieval castles, but I prefer it to bizarre abstract sub-sci-fi nonsense such as this and Eclipse.

Easily marked as a Kickstarter product due to the unevenness of the presentation (incredible art, weak theme, incredible pieces, box made of tissue paper) and the rather obvious lack of playtesting. Dice placement games should not put you at the mercy of the dice. Otherwise, you might as well just play a regular dice-rolling game.

Played at QV with Gerret et al. Lost. I like the bits, but I always felt confronted with too many options all the time.

Unique approach to the worker placement genre. A lot in Euphoria is done well: the components, the artwork, and the overall cuteness of the concept are all appealing for players accustomed to ultra-dry Euros. The core mechanics of the game are straight-forward, plus the game forces you to balance out accumulating too many of any one thing: workers, artifacts, and resources. There was never a section of the board I didn't utilize or at least didn't understand which, in my opinion, makes the game's design compact and clear. From the numerous science fiction references to the picture of Viticulture (the designers' last game) as an artifact, the game's clever wit is my favorite part of Euphoria. (As one of my film professors would say about "Hot Fuzz" or any well-made, post-modern art: "It knows where it comes from.") Euphoria is a sly, smart twist on the genre and one I can't wait to play again.

A long long slog of inching along. Get a resource, convert it into better resource or a card, repeat until you have enough, convert them into a star. Repeat 10 times to get your 10 stars out before the other players do to win the game. Do some other stuff like retrieving your workers (your dice), and spending resource to get more workers. Take advantage of your special power to get an edge. Resource, resource, resource, convert. Resource, resource, resource, convert. You get the idea. Not enough of anything interesting to keep you coming back, except to see if you can do it more efficiently next time because you have a better idea of how it hangs together.

Holy Resource Management Salad, Batman! 2 interwining paradigms of resources/commodities handling, mixed with worker placement dice of changing intelligence, all to race to achieve 10 authority star tokens within a pseudo-utopia environment.  Yes, that's right: no victory point track here. Though this has worker-placement dice, this is much different than Kingsburg and Alien Frontiers.  Games can take between 20 to 30 minutes per player depending on whether or not players get what's going on. 

I feel this is a wonderful and unique game. I was truly surprised how it felt after playing it. I couldn't stop thinking about it. This may be in my top 3 favorite games. I also enjoy the whole look of it.

WARNING: With the slight learning curve, the potential for players getting overwhelmed, and the complex story/theme, I must say this game is not for everyone. Learn it with a good teacher: learn the ropes, and have a good time.

"Cheery and colorful dystopian worker placement game. There is a lot to like here, although the shared building is not really my style. "

What I like:
- Fantastic components!
- Great theme, which helps manage the complexity
- Seems to play pretty quickly (it is a race)

What I don't like:
- Not yet sure if I like all the player interaction
- Daunting complexity, at least at first, although it is actually quite smooth

Race to 10 VP, by collecting and spending resources. Market construction and commodity harvesting have some potential collaboration between players, which normally I don't enjoy, but might be OK here. 

I would put they weight around 3.2, just a bit higher than BGG voters.

I bought this for the great components, humorous theme, but where is the game? Too repetitive, Easy decisions, random character draws at the beginning can make a huge difference in who gets ahead, takes too long for even a two player game. (Two hours) it's a race to put down ten markers and usually the winner is one dice placement ahead. Can't imagine how long this would take with 4 people.

I compare all worker placement games to Trajan now, which is far better, much more involving, cheaper to buy, and plays in half the time. 'Euphoria' is my second big WP disappointment after 'the ancient world'. (All looks and no game) While I appreciate artwork and great components, this game is just too random with all the dice rolling. It doesn't bring anything new or fresh to the WP genre. 

It's also very easy to forget all the marketplace abilities that hinder players who didn't get on them, as you may be having to remember six market abilities plus everyone's character cards. there are a large amount of character cards which would bring some variety to the game, but it doesn't fix the meh gameplay. If it was a shorter game, like 45 minutes, it would be easier to forgive. I already started thinking of reducing the stars needed to win to 5, just to get it over with. Definitely outstays its welcome. I am becoming very wary of KS projects. 

Update: Also played scythe a couple times. It is confirmed. Stegmaier cannot design a decent game. How this guy got so popular, based on this kind of fluff, is astounding.

RATING: 7
After first play: Still undecided on the rating. I will try this a few more plays. 

First play gave the feeling you're just repeting the same things over and over again there is no progress. 

Resource-types are unbalanced and recruits even more. Your recruits force you towards different resource strategies and water is much more powerful than energy since you gain most needed "hearts" when recruiting worker-dice with water. 

The recruit that gives you the right to place one star instead of two is way too powerful, when placing only ten stars is the winning condition. 

Just like Viticulture this game suffers from too easy to get more workers. This problem is enhanced with having very few workers from the beginning. 

After a few more plays the initial shortcomings have been eliminated, but it still suffers from repetition, and is not a game you wanna play often.

5 Plays - Great game, but three things stop me from giving this a near perfect score. 

1. You have to play this game without its, "roll a double and take another move" rule. Unfortunately, using the rule has its benefits though. For example, it helps break up the timing (and therefore predictability) of players moves and allows for exciting dice placing 'combos'. It also factors into the bumping of opponents players workers and retracting workers (e.g. returning an opponents worker to an empty die pool makes it impossible for them to roll a double). A little 'something' IS lost without the rule (as it clearly had purpose in the games' design), but playing with the luck it introduces is just too painful. 2. I would really have liked to have seen EITHER a lot more asymmetry in terms of the different factions worker placement areas or more variety in worker placement options in general. I say this because the game strategies are identical (or perfectly mirrored?) for each faction, with the exception of the cloud faction 3. When you don't contribute to a building you become subject to a penalty - In my playthroughs, these penalties can often be easily  overlooked. The penalties are also particularly brutal, especially if you accumulate a few. So while they're easily overlooked, they also don't often come into play (or stay in play for long). So in practice, they act as more of a threat that prevents 'ignoring the buildings' as a viable option and keeping everyone on a similar path. This in turn makes each playthrough feel even more similar. I feel the mechanic here could be tweaked a bit to make penalties more intuitive for players, as well make buildings a more optional task, allowing players to build different strategies. Again, playing without the 'roll-a-double and get a free move' also helps prevent players from being 'locked out' of a building as a result of a 'dice-placing' combo, making the penalties even more superflous.


What makes me still hold some interest in this game, is its unique take on dice/ worker placement: 1. Retracting workers from the board needs to be balanced with your position on the knowledge track. 2. Placing a dice on an action opens up different cumulative opportunities for yourself and others, encouraging players to 'stack' workers into the same action space for different results. 3. This was one of the earlier designs to include the concept of worker 'bumping', where you can take an action another player has already done, but it allows their worker to 'return' to their worker pool. This in turn builds into point 1 (returning workers and knowledge track position), as well as the rolling of doubles as already mentioned. 4. Jamie has a great mind and eye for theme, touching on darker aspects of humanity with lightness and humour.

Final thoughts: As it stands however, the incorporation of the roll-a-double mechanic is close to game-breaking, as it introduces a very powerful, yet undesirable luck element. The mechanic was clearly built into the game design with purpose though and removing it does prevent 'combos', the exciting rapid/unforeseen building developments, as well as interactions with worker retraction. Either way, something is lost. Secondly, the game feels really 'same-samey' unless you become aligned with the sky/ cloud faction, as the pathways to victory are just too similar. It's a fun game and worth a try and I would happily play from time to time.

Based on one play: A worker placement game with a very nice look. It is a little shorter then most games of the genre however there is a lot going on. After one play it is tough to see a strategy as there are many options and you do need to react to what others are doing, as they may hinder or help you. A single strategy is tough to find as there is just so many options and ways to play down your points. Definitely would need to play again to form an opinion.

This game is really interesting. The theme is great, and is very well integrated into the mechanics and the artwork and component design. 

The worker placement mechanic of using rolled dice is a fantastic idea. It reminds me a little of The Castles Of Burgundy in that all dice rolls are equally useful, just some are more useful in some ways and others are more useful in other ways.

While the box says the game is for 2-6, it really comes alive with at least three, and four would probably be even better. With two, there isn't really enough interaction between the two players, and this game is at it's best when people are pushing others' dice out of spaces and finishing markets before you get the chance to join in.

At 2 players, this game is a 5. At 3+, I give it a 7.

Euphoria, a game that asks players to build a better dystopia, offers an uncommon thematic experience. As a mid-level boss in a dystopian society, you must try to keep your workers dumb and happy, a task to which there is no small measure of luck involved. Nevertheless, Euphoria’s willingness to break from the mold of other worker placement games keeps the gameplay fun and interesting. In contrast to most games where players use workers to effectively block others from taking actions and gaining perks, here anyone can gain the full benefits afforded locations on the board by bumping the current player’s worker back to their owner, the catch here being that this could end up giving that player a free turn on the rebound. Euphoria truly attempts to break new ground in the worker placement genre, and succeeds at doing so while also providing an enjoyable and original experience.

RATING: 8
Euphoria is a worker placement game in which you use dice for workers.  The value of the dice is not that relevant to gameplay--the main reason for dice is that if the total value of your dice ever exceeds a certain value, your workers are "too smart" and you lose one of them (this isn't too hard to avoid).  The remarkable aspect of this game is its use of "micro-actions"--during your turn, you're either placing one worker and doing the action, or pulling your workers back.  There are no rounds, resolution phases, etc.; everything is encompassed in these micro-actions, which makes the game flow really well.  Aside from that, it's a resource management game (the bits are gorgeous) where you're trying to be the first one to 10 VPs.

Everything from the un intuitive actions to the unhelpful icons in this game just screams "impediment to understanding". Buildings are an exercise in groupthink and the method by which you lose workers seems almost entirely arbitrary. Dice rolls are nearly useless and seem tacked on because of Stefan Feld's popularity. 

Only thing palatable about this game are the wooden pieces, which look like Lucky Charms marshmallows and say "Kickstarter".

For the games problems(very busy board that can be hard to take in, some very aggressively random elements in anotherwise strategic euro game) they are all forgiven by the awesome way the game never has a "refresh" step where all the action grinds to a halt AND the way the game is an exciting race the whole way through.  This game is a rush every time and despite a few bumpy patches I enjoy it a great deal.

Euphoria is a game set in a dystopian future, wherein each player is… someone trying to do… something. Frankly, I have no idea. For a game with a cool theme, it ends up coming off as pretty abstract. Mechanically, Euphoria is a worker placement game that uses dice as workers. Similar to games such as Tzolkin and Manhattan Project, on a single turn, players either place workers to take actions or pull workers from the board. Each player starts with 10 star token that represent victory points, and the first play to place all of her stars on the board wins immediately. 

There are certainly some interesting mechanisms in the game. Players have to manage a number of resource tracks, one of which is worker intelligence. When workers are pulled from or bumped off of the board, the player rolls all of her dice. If the sum of the dice and the intelligence track exceeds a certain threshold, the workers have become too intelligent and one runs away, meaning the player loses a worker. There are also role cards, some open and some hidden, that grant players special abilities at certain points in the game. Finally, one of the ways to score points involves building markets, which are a set of connected spaces on the board, each of which requires a specific resource. Because there are more spaces than a player typically has workers, once one player starts construction of a market, there is a rush among other players to be contribute to the process. Not only does this provide those players with a point, but after the market is built, a tile flips which has a penalty on it. Those players that contributed to the construction of the market are unaffected by the penalty, so there is additional incentive even beyond the point that construction provides.

There is a lot going on in this game, but at first glance it seems to me that the Hodge-podge of mechanisms obfuscates an otherwise pretty shallow and random game. There is so much hidden information and so many resources to track that it is difficult to see a path to points. Granted, it was my first play and we played with a full complement of six (which I wouldn’t recommend), but there wasn’t enough here to make me want to go back to the game. Euphoria also suffers from some pretty bad art and graphic design, which certainly doesn’t help its case. After hearing so many positive things, this was a big let-down for me.

Despite the surface complexity, the game is actually pretty fast and relatively light.  With two players it can be a bit unbalanced depending on the recruits that each person draws.  I haven't played this much with a higher player count, but I would imagine the game excels with more players. Overall, a good compromise between the elements I like in a game and the elements my partner likes in a game.

This game is similar to 'Alien Frontiers' but a step up in complexity. You're really subject to your dice rolls here. With the way intelligence works in the game, you can easily lose one of your workers, which can be devastating. Also, getting excluded from a project is devastating (and it's meant to be that way). So the game becomes a bit of a grind. The board looks really busy here, too.

RATING: 4
The components are nice in the deluxe edition. Unfortunately that's about as good as it gets with this game.  The role cards powers are uneven. the artifact cards are underutilized.  The game takes many little turns of getting a single resource at a time before it ramps up to where you feel like you are accomplishing anything. luck as to who got hit by the random and way too severe worker removal mechanic seemed to be the deciding factor between otherwise samey actions. The game punishes the players in last by giving negative effects to those who aren't able to spend the right resources and get the right action spots in time for a tile flip. Even the board layout is a little hard to understand in terms of which action spots connect so which factions.

Very clever and entertaining worker placement.  Tongue is planted firmly in cheek with the theme, and that suits me right down to the ground...if your workers get hip to the idea that they are being exploited, the smartest one bolts...and I laugh every time.  A truly fun and interesting take on a crowded genre.

Noch vor dem Spielen fällt auf, dass das Spielbrett deutlich überfrachtet ist- zu viele Kasten, Piktogramme und Formen, die leider die wirklich schöne Grafik der Dystopie verdecken. Als nächstes fällt sofort die Spitzenqualität der Materialien auf: die Ressourcen sehen grandios aus (auch wenn meine Vorstlelungskraft nicht ausreicht für Seligkeit als Handelsware), die Würfel sehen klasse aus und die Tunnelarbeiter sind aller erste Sahne. Aber das Spiel hat auch in seinen Mechaniken einiges auf dem Kasten. Es gibt viele interessante Richtungen, in die sich eine Strategie entwickeln kann und die Rekruten verleihen dem Spiel seine Würze. Die Märkte finde ich durch ihre Fähigkeiten zwar super spannend, die Platzierung der Sterne (durch die Märkte und die Sechsecke) stört mich aber im großen Maße und ist einfach nicht eingängig. Ansonsten: super Spiel!

Another worker placement game with a blend of resource management, which you convert into achieving a goal. First one to deploy 10 goal stars wins. 
Most of your actions are gathering resources, advancing a power of 1 of the 4 factions, using resources to deploy a goal. There are several hooks.
You start with 2 faction cards one hidden so there a bit of hidden role aspect. 
The markets require some cooperative element and if you ignore it there penalty that hurts enough to force you to play catch up in another method.
The workers a dice so if you have too many available workers you run a risk that you get too high value so your workers become "too smart" and you lose one. 

The came flows quickly since everything is a single action - placing a worker doing the action, bringing workers back, hoping that the others will displace your workers so you don't have to burn a turn to bring them home. Not as sure about the helper cards since they seem to run the gamut from extraordinary to ho-hum, not bad for variety but hard on players with different experience levels.

I might be a bit biased on this one since I'm still excited about scoring a Kickstarter version at BGG.con 2014.  It includes upgraded components with stamped metal gold bars, bricks of clay that actually look like porous bricks, wooden bits instead of the cardboard - just a beautiful game all around.  That said, the gameplay is fast and dynamic with a perfect level of tongue-in-cheek humor thrown in.  Only played it a couple of times, but will definitely be adding to that in the near future.

RATING: 6.5
Note - only the one play.  But I came away with the overwhelming view that the game was alright, and no better.  There were too many small things to keep track of, issues handling an insufficiency of components, the curiosity of expensive custom dice which (I) behave as ordinary D6, and (II) where the numbers rolled don't matter to an enormous degree (although you ARE disadvantaged if you roll the wrong numbers for places to which you didn't contribute, and never manage to roll any doubles at all - guess who that was in our game?). I'm not sure I would damn it with the judgement "mediocre" after just one game, but it certainly falls short of being very good or great, and in a very crowded marketplace games should aspire to better.

First things first, this is a gorgeous game. I was already sold on Euphoria on aesthetics alone. So, does Euphoria have the game mechanics to support such impressive style? Well, that depends...

Everything in Euphoria is synchronized. This is a game where it is very easy to help another player, but pretty difficult to hurt anyone. Once everyone is experienced with the game, you'll discover subtle ways to slow down a winner, but winning will always require a bit of teamwork.

Overall, I love the way the board evolves throughout the game and the secret faction characters always shake things up. Euphoria is basically the definition of semi-cooperative, and even though the game sometimes forces me to be nicer to my opponents than I'd like, I always have a good time with it.

After one play: a worthy game, but flawed by having too many weird little things to keep track of. This is a flaw I can forgive if the gameplay is exceptional, but I don't think this design quite meets that mark.

This is a race game to assert your authority over  the world.  Surprisingly it is a really fun euro game that doesn't have a ton of assertive conflict. It's really a race game to get rid of your authority token first.  This is done using worker placement.  Workers are dice and the number rolled can play a factor with placement but it also uses a unique method using the total die rolls to do an awareness check.  The theme integrate great as you feel like you are a mid level authority in a dystopian world trying to keep your workers productive and unaware of their controlled atmosphere.  love the asymmetry  of the starting set up and I can see the replay ability being high as starting ability will be different almost every time.  Just a great unique game with a great theme.

I backed this on kickstarter (along with many many others), and was incredibly excited about the game - the theme was cool and seemed well-linked to the mechanics, which had several features which I haven't seen before (the building of markets which give penalties to the players not involved in them, the management of knowledge to try to avoid losing workers, the various allegiance bonuses), and a very wide selection of recruit cards with special abilities, to make each game different.

And the game initially lived up to my expectations after arriving in December 2013 - for a while it was a game that I always wanted to play and to explore new strategies in. (I did terribly in most of my first few plays.) However, inevitably, the "shiny" factor of a new game has worn off by now, and this is no longer one of my top choices - hence I have revised my BGG rating down to a 7. It's a good game, but not outstanding, and there are many other games - including older ones as well as newer - which I would now rather play.

This game is very slick. It works very well and everything interacts and works so smoothly. I feel like it's a cross between Scythe and Viticulture (obviously both from Jamie Stegmaier/Stonemaier Games). It seems that there might be ties fairly often and a need to go to the tie breakers. Knowing that, you may want to focus some of your attention to those areas. There also could be some balance problems if someone rolls doubles more frequently. With it being random, it could allow the person in the lead to run away. I also wish the player powers were more powerful. However, at the same time, it could cause issues if a player is left out when all other opponents have their factions hidden people revealed. It seems like I have a lot of issues with this game, but that is far from the case. This game is great and I can't wait to play it again.

Me pareceu que a grande sacada dele é você não precisar trazer de volta seus dados, esperando que os próprios jogadores os desloquem. Com isso dá pra ter muitos dados de uma vez sem perdê-los e otimizar suas jogadas. 

Mas com 3 jogadores (como eu joguei) acontece muito pouco de você deslocar alguém, pois o jogo tem o mesmo número de espaços de ação com 3 ou com 6 jogadores.

Aí o jogo se resume a uma corrida monocórdia por produção de recursos, que não permite ações interessantes, escala pouco e uniformemente ao longo do jogo, e acaba ficando sem graça.

Very rich and fun worker placement resource management game with lots of options and minimum downtime due to clever 'one action' per player/per turn system. Rules are not overly complicated, game is accessible to hardcore as well as to entry players. But you need a few plays to get 'into it'.

And don't be fooled. Game winner is not decided by luck. Even though randomness is present (luckily), player who is more able to constantly adjust to actual situation who can react to opponents move and who could carefully and quickly prepare his "only" action (per turn)  at the end wins...if no such player is present, "lucky" player wins (and still other players could have fun time :-))

Oh...and on top of that....GREAT THEME + GREAT PRODUCTION VALUE, BEAUTIFUL COMPONENTS.

KS Supreme edition. Beautiful components. Probably the best production values of any "conventional" game I own. 

Solid game, but oddly lifeless, regardless of the ambience. The goal cards don't have any real differentiation, the pace is just too slow, the board feels cramped, and AP can be a real problem. Might be better with more plays, but there are so many games out there with a better payoff in fewer plays. Probably won't hit the table anytime soon, compared to others in my collection.

This is a really unique strategy game where players are trying to gain influence represented by stars in the different districts of the city. You roll dice to determine your workers intelligence then place those dice on the board to gain resources which help you get influence.  The smarter the worker the more he can produce but if your workers are too smart they realize they are being exploited and leave your workforce, forcing you to use your resources to recruit more.

Pros:Extremely thematic, unique theme, quick gameplay with an element of luck and strategy, unique gameplay mechanism never seen before. 

Cons: games seem too end too quickly.really difficult to teach with many foreign gameplay concepts.

It was ok, but nothing special.  Reminded me quite a bit of other similar games, but had some new ideas.  Almost like an optimisation game trying to get your VPs down the most efficient way, and beware of not getting those early VPs quickly, or you'll struggle later.  I do almost wonder why dice were used though - the numbers you rolled seemed almost entirely irrelevant most of the time.

It's got high production values, and plays reasonably well, but it's another worker-placement-with-bumping-and-explicit-worker-return game that just boils down to efficiency at converting resources.

KS版本配件没得说，非常赞。
背景非常的赞，虽然是虚构的故事，但很有代入感，可能跟美工，背景有很大关系。整体元素比较多，第一遍听规则的时候不知所云，玩了两轮才开始有点感觉。流畅度来说其实很不错。
The token of KS edition is excellent.
The background is also very brilliant. Although it's a fictive story, it's very vivid， maybe it's because of the delicate token and art design.
The whole element is pretty abundant, and it perplex me a little. But after two round I know what's going on and feel it smooth.
Anyway I will try it again later.

Another dissappointment from 2013. Die roll-knowledge connection has a lot of unused potential, recruits can be hit-or-miss (random! random!) and at the end of the game all of the players have too much useless resources.

RATING: 3
Visually the game is very appealing, although once I got my head around how it is actually played, I was struck by very "Oh, is that it?" sentiments. It doesn't seem to do much of interest that other games don't already do, and the theme feels a bit wasted. Rubbed me the wrong way to learn that part of the board was only included as a kickstarter bonus - so the game would have been different if fewer people backed it? 

The lack of mitigation of lucky rolls is the game's real flaw, though, and pretty unforgivable in design terms. Most other worker placement games I've played are better as games. 

Pretty, though.

RATING: 7
Quite complex struggle of three different factions (the Ikarines don't really count). Interesting decision from the start of the game - when you choose your starting recruits- and throughout the game when placing your dice and trying to avoid building a setup for your opponents. A nice feature is the fact that you have to keep your workers dump and happy ;)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Apart from the sheer beauty of the components, what separates Euphoria from your average worker placement game is the simplicity, elegance and effectiveness of the dice worker placement system. Where Deadwood and The Manhattan Project used a similar place or remove mechanic, Euphoria has expanded upon the mechanism and structured quite a bit of the game around it. Interesting choices now present themselves as players gamble to keep the number of pips on their dice below 16 to avoid the setback of losing a worker. The reward is having more workers to place before they must be removed again, and an increase in the chances of the wondrous doubles. Watch other players bump a worker off just to push you over the 16 threshold. Watch players camp on the most sought after spaces while removing the rest of their workers. There's some clever choices to make and the dice do a beautiful job of keeping the game interesting.

Unfortunately the rest of the game is a fairly standard resource collection and conversion into victory points exercise dressed in a theme that holds limited appeal for me. It's certainly a decent race into areas and to place those pointy stars, but the game is so forgiving with so many ways to acquire what you need when you need it that there's not much tension, only meticulous planning saved by the fun of betting on the roll of the dice.

Because of the theme the rule book is a bit of a challenge to decipher without the components in front of you, but if you've got someone to explain it to you then you'll find it's a very simple game to pick up.

RATING: 5
This is a race game with worker placement as its central mechanic. Workers either harvest basic resources, turn basic resources into advanced resources, or allow you to pay advanced resources in order to place stars onto a limited number of spaces. Whoever places a fixed number of stars first, wins. 

Since this a race, whoever gets more turns has a distinct advantage. You get more turns than your opponents in one of four different ways, the first two being completely random: (1) by dice rolling multiples of the same number (in effect resulting in your opponent having to skip their turn), (2) by avoiding rolling clutches of very high numbers (resulting in a potential loss of a worker which will cost you 2-3 turns to get back), (3) by having more workers than your opponents, which then minimizes the number of "dead" turns you have to take to get your workers back from the board, and (4) by getting your worker bumped from the board by another player's (or your own) worker when placed in the same spot, again delaying the need to essentially waste a turn to recall your workers back from the board. If the board was tighter, this last mechanic could have resulted in more player interaction, but alas, this is not the case and you are seldom forced to give your opponent an edge by bumping his/her worker.

The game has high quality components and an interesting theme, but for me falls flat in its dry-as-dust game play and high impact of lucky/unlucky dice rolls.

Eh... Probably one of the most disappointing games I've ever played.  Really LOVED the theme of the game, and thought the dice mechanic of keeping your workers below a certain level to keep them 'dumb' was SO clever.  However, the gameplay was really not good with two players.  Just didn't have anything unique to offer besides the dice rolls.  Maybe with more players it is better... but how much, I can't really tell.

This is a fun dice placement game. It has a number of interesting dynamics, such as the timing of when to start building the markets. You don't want to do it too early, because if no one else has resources, they won't help you complete it, and you'll be stuck with the choice of taking inefficient turns pulling back 1-2 dice or waste the resource you spent to start the market. At the same time, you want to contribute to building it so that you don't get penalized.

I won this as a play-to-win prize from LexiCon Gaming Convention in Lexington, KY earlier in May 2014.  This is a great "step-up" type of worker-placement game using dice as the workers.  

This game has a neat dystopian theme with a fun storyline that hearkens back to my high school experience of reading such books as George Orwell's "1984", Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World", and Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451". The component quality is top-notch and this game looks stunning when set up and ready to play on the table as well as during gameplay too. My wife enjoys winning this game whenever we play so I like to play it even if I lose, which I do often.  I enjoy the multiple paths to victory approach.

This is a tough game to rate after just one play.  I enjoyed it, but some of my fellow gamers thought that there felt like there was something missing.  I like how the markets punish whoever isn't in them, but in our 5p game, as soon as someone started to build it, it was an automatic rush to complete it.  The knowledge track and morale track both served a nice function, but only once was a worker lost.  I'm going to tentatively rate it an 8 as I enjoyed it quite a bit.  It certainly needs additional plays.

An additional play with 4p has me knocking this down.  I still enjoyed playing it, but there are definitely things about it that aren't usually there in games that I really like.  I don't like the fact that there is virtually nothing you can do to stop the other players.  I also don't like that the winner is usually determined before the game ends - a flaw of these "the game ends when you place your 10th star" games like Alien Frontiers.

This is a very fun worker placement using dice as the worker. The dice roll does not matter too much when placing them on the board (except for few action spaces), but it matters a lot when taking workers off the board as you can lose your worker if you have a bad roll. Fortunately there are ways to mitigate this risk by lowering your base knowledge, placing your workers in spaces where people cannot boot you off the board, or simply removing your workers smartly. The game feels different than most of the other worker placement games I have played, so I am excited to play more!

The factions add an interesting flavour to what otherwise feels like a heavier version of Asking for Trobils. I found anticipation for your next turn is really strong in this game, and though turns are relatively quick, that can still make a round seem very long. I have only played with 6 so far, and I think it might be better with fewer players.

The theme of the game is strange - there isn't a huge amount of lore or overt world building, but the short descriptions and the art design and the actions available on the board all combine to create an awesome atmosphere and feel.

I have only played this game once, but plan to play it again.  These are my initial impressions: Colorful and busy board; several types and levels of resources (too many); lots of order of operations actions and converting one thing to another for no real purpose.  The game essentially has 3 factions that are the same, but contain different types of resources, a 4th faction that's a bit different, and some random markets that penalize players for not helping.  There are multiple paths to victory, but 75% are really the same, but just use a different type of resource.  The dice rolling is extremely annoying and difficult to mitigate; it's easy to get screwed by the dice roll.  I gained a worker and lost it on the same turn three times due to the roll and total being greater than 16, so that essentially 3-6 lost actions/turns.  Players fortunate enough to roll doubles have a significant advantage, especially when it comes to contributing to building markets and not getting left out and then later penalized.  There seems to be a lot of treading water during the first half to two-thirds of the games while players build up resources, workers, and start building markets and then it peaks and runs through to the end fairly quickly.  It's easy to get left behind, especially in a 5 player game.  There really isn't anything extremely new or different in this game; it's mediocre at best and not that much fun.

This game was decent and something I wouldn't mind playing now and then.  There is definitely some strategy that you can employ while you play.  I haven't played it enough to feel too comfortable arguing strategy though.

The biggest thing that I disliked was the dice rolling.  When I play a game, the longer it is the less I like chance to be involved.  The dice rolling in this game can be really frustrating.  Especially the rule of getting to place two workers at a time if you roll pairs or higher.

Otherwise the game seems to be one of follow the group.  You want to be involved in doing whatever other people are doing.  What I mean by this is that if you are doing your own thing while everyone else is doing similar actions like build markets, you will probably lose.  This is good and bad.  It is good in that it makes for a bit more interaction and responsive play making.  I dislike it because a decent amount of the game can be decided on what your opponents happened to choose before the game started.

What I mean is the recruitment cards.  Everyone chooses 2 recruit cards from 4 they get at the start.  One is played and the other saved for later.  They all have abilities that help you in the game and a faction.  Besides the fact that I question how balanced these cards are, what everyone chooses decides the pace of the game.  If you chose a recruit card of a faction that no one else went for then you are already behind. (similar to what I said earlier where you want to follow the group)

I like this game. The theme (or perhaps backstory) is intelligent and fits the mechanics very well. The artwork and components are absolutely gorgeous. The only thing that keeps this from garnering a higher rating is my dislike of the endgame. For the same reason I don't like Settlers of Catan, I yearn for a better endgame here. The whole race to 10 victory points (or in this case, the race to place 10 authority tokens on the board) feels a little... underdeveloped for me. I'd prefer something like every time a player places a token, he or she gets X victory points (maybe decreasing with each placement; or perhaps based on how much moral you currently have; or even the lower of moral or intelligence when placed). Then the first player to place the 10th token only triggers the end of game, and there's still victory points to consider for winner. I don't know; maybe it wouldn't work in practice. It's just a personal taste thing, and I don't like the racing mechanism (at least not like this). Also: even though it says 60 minutes, our games are always much longer. Our last game with 5 player, for instance, lasted 2.5 hours. A little too long for what you get.

Mmmm... there isn't much room in my heart for this type of game (resource conversion by means of worker placement) since it's really not my favorite genre.

I found I was enjoying it more than I thought I would as we played (was pretty sure I'd completely hate it from the onset), but with 6 players (5 new) it was a bit too long. The engine building is pretty limited, and slowly, tactically converting resources without really getting better at it as the game goes wasn't really that exciting -- and there was only limited stuff to fight over (the construction sites), and I think even those would be friendly with 4 or less players?

Also, I fear luck has too big of an impact for this type of game, between quite possibly massively lopsided cards, and dice rolls which basically end up determining just how many actions you'll get. The swing between rolling doubles and kicking ass, and rolling high and losing a worker (yes, this risk can be mitigated or eliminated, but if someone else is on a lucky streak you're basically forced to take risks to match their action output) is pretty big.

Colorful and nice to look at for a cube conversion game!

A fair bit of luck in this game.  It boils down to a race to get rid of stars, which I think might get a little "samey" after a few plays.  It has a cool theme, but it really doesn't come out much in the gameplay.  Unfortunately, I think it falls in the cracks of being a little too complex for family play, but too simple for my friends.  It does play up to 6 people which is a bonus.

The theme of Euphoria is what initially sold me on this one. Well, that and the amazing production of the pieces. Having played it several times now, it's a good game, but not the masterpiece I was hoping for. It does some unique things with worker placement and resource management, but I don't know if the game was properly balanced at all player counts. I've had to house rule the following to compensate for playing with fewer players: the the bonus for rolling doubles (placing both workers at once), moving along the tunnel tracks, the ease of maxing out the Icarites, and the lack of tension from the Knowledge track. The look and feel of the game is fantastic, but unfortunately, the actual play isn't as engaging, at least with fewer than five or six players.

Played a 4-player game today: 3 new people plus the owner played in one hour, but with explanations it came in closer to 90 minutes. I really like how the dice work to influence the amount of resources you can take.

Some of the recruit cards felt unbalanced, like the one that gives you two resources in exchange for a heart when anyone rolls doubles. Viticulture has similar issues with the visitor cards; I expect this to be changed at some point.

Although I give it an 8, it's not something I feel a need to rush out and buy, because I can't see my family playing it.

Preliminary thoughts: Clever dice rolling Euro with an appealing theme that is slightly more than pasted on. You're busy trying to gain authority over the various parts of this dystopia in a race for resources and position. A key mechanic is that your dice/worker can't be blocked from going someplace your opponent is already at, however you may not want to because that will give them an extra free turn. The humor in the cards and locations helps bring out the theme but is low key. I'm not sure how much I'll like this long term but it has the appeal of being quite fast.

This game is quite a bit of fun, and the board and components, especially with the Kickstater version are gorgeous. It looks fairly complex out of the box, but it's honestly pretty easy to learn and teach. The markets are a very interesting mechanic; in our first game, none of us really found their benefits appealing, but we raced to build them all any way to handicap anyone who couldn't or simply elected not to get in on the build. This is a game that I hope will hit the table often.

Not only is the theme unique, but the mechanics and art bring out the theme wonderfully.  The dice placement mechanism, recruit cards, and allegiance tracks are excellent aspects of the game.  Playing this game truly is bliss.

This game combines the "ease" of the modern Euro game with the "grognardness" of a classic AH or SPI game... it's a worker placement game for the thinking gamer - definitely not the game to get someone into the hobby.  But for an experienced gamer wanting something with a little meat to it, this is worth every penny.  And if you're a fan of the dystopian theme you'll find a few chuckles too (some of the market and recruit names are quite amusing and clever).  Definitely on my short list of games I need to play again.. and again..

Our copy was a big hit at a local gaming convention this weekend.  The box says 60 minutes but for a 6 player game I'd suggest 75-90 minutes unless everyone is really focused.  People were distracted (typical con noise, etc) so we took between 90 minutes and 2 hours with new players.

The kickstarter components are incredible - the clay and gold in particular are components that you'll catch people fondling. :)

Great presentation on this one: the artwork is interesting, the dice are fun to look at yet still functional, and the carved wooden pieces are a nice touch. For a Euro game, the theme is both interesting and actually woven in decently. The interesting idea here is how if the total of your dice is too much and your workers get too smart, you have to return them. I like how the spaces provide more reward the more people are there and how your recruits are uncovered once a bunch of actions have been taken with a single faction.

But why don't I like it? First and foremost, it is a race game, and I'm not super fond of those, although if well done, I've found them enjoyable (see [thing=127023][/thing]). But here I find that the arc is pretty dull here. Primarily, you need to open up new markets in order to be able to place enough stars, and to open up the new markets, you need cooperation to make that happen, or just let your opponents churn through and score a bunch of points through cards. The strategies are not really multi-faceted: you churn through the Icarian faction, as it gets you stars and cards, and then if someone is building a market, then you can just swoop in and get the same star as they did. And don't get me started about introducing trading into the game: unless it's a true negotiation game (which this really isn't), it's a hack to make it easier to facilitate the cooperation that a better design would have generated. Such potential in this and unfortunately wasted.

This is one of my favorite worker placement games. There is a lot going on (lots of options), but once you learn it the rules are straight-forward. 

It starts slow and gains momentum after a few turns. Then, the pace suddenly snowballs, with everyone scoring multiple points in their turn, and if you are not positioned to keep up at that point then you are toast. That dynamic makes it a lot of fun because you can see it coming but are not quite sure when it will happen.  

I also like that many of your decisions are dilemmas (you benefit but so do your opponents).

Pretty interesting worker-placement game. We learned it more from a player aid than the actual rules, so the theme really didn't come through at all (except for how having too much knowledge makes your workers likely to leave you!). Will need to try it again, with people who know the rules.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
This is a worker placement game where dice are the workers. The (VERY busy) board shows 3 cities, each with a tunnel track and 2 face down (randomly chosen from a large set) market tiles; and a 4th city with several face up markets -- each city is associated with a faction. There are also several action spaces, a track for knowledge and morale (1-6 each), and a track for each of the 4 factions in the game. Players get 4 character cards, keeping one face up and another face down; these belong to 1 of the 4 factions and give you an extra power when face up.

On your turn, either ...
- retrieve any/all dice (either pay a resource and gain 2 morale, or pay nothing and lose 1 morale)
OR
- place one die; if you have matched dice, may take multiple turns placing them one by one
Any time you get any dice back, roll it/them, add to any pips already in front of you, and add your knowledge track position. If sum >15, return your highest die to Supply.

Placing dice may require payment of resources, and can do a variety of things:
- acquire resources (several types; get more with higher sums)
- allow contributing towards building (and flipping) a market
- gain a die (max 4)
- advance tunnel track (get far enough and that faction's influence track advances; get to the end an extra resource-acquiring action space opens for players supporting the faction)
- build a city piece
- may also advance a faction's influence track; as these advance, they cross thresholds giving players with that faction's character card face up additional bonuses (e.g., acquire more resources, flip face down character cards)

Players have 10 authority tokens. These are placed when building city pieces, building markets, or with some character cards. The first player to place them all wins!

This is an excellent, very fresh feeling, worker placement game.  The goal of Euphoria is to collect enough resources to place "stars" in certain areas on the board.  The places that can accommodate stars are limited depending on the number of players so there is a bit of a race to get to these as well.

Collecting the resources is somewhat standard worker placement fare, just place one of your workers on a space and collect the printed amount of materials.  However the unique thing here is that we are trying to keep our workers stupid and happy because if they get too smart we lose them.  The workers in this game are dice and the pips showing on the dice may grant us more resources but they also represent the worker's intelligence.  This also means that while like most worker placement games, more workers means more actions which means better chance to win they also get more intelligent in numbers and you run a higher risk of losing one.  This balance makes for a lot of interesting decisions.

The other thing I really like about the game play is that each player has a unique personality that gives a minor bonus revealed at the start of the game and another that gets revealed later.  These personalities belong to one of four factions that advance and grant more bonuses to players if they have a personality belonging to that faction later in the game.  So revealing these second personalities later in the game can twist things up, especially if now you are taking advantage of bonuses you allowed an opponent to unlock for you.

Also, even with the non-deluxe version, the components are awesome.  All the resources are different shapes (they look like the marshmallows in a box of Lucky Charms) and the board and cards are brightly colored with wonderful artwork.  I really enjoy this game, yet another one I'm sad I missed the Kickstarter boat for.

Awesome theme!! It took a bit to get into the game (there is a lot info to take in at first) but slowly I enjoyed it more and more and now I definitely want to play it again. It is worker/dice placement with a lot going on, I loved how you had to make sure the moral among your people is high and keep them dumb at the same time so they wouldn't revolt, like I mentioned, awesome theme. Recommended!

RATING: 6
Love that it does away with rounds, which always seem to exist in worker placement games.

I was initially drawn in by the delightful components and the funny flavor text but I see issues with it now. In general, I feel like there are too many rules/bits that are kinda just not relevant most of the time and then makes someone feel bad when they are. Rolling doubles, drawing the exact artifact card you need, losing a worker. I feel like there's a bit too much variance/swinginess in a game where you're expected to get ahead by tiny margins, especially since they're things you don't have that much control over.

Only half the resources are relevant to you in any given game, and you can get punished for not being lucky enough to select members of the same factions that other players have selected. Most of the special powers are marginal/situational so they don't have a whole lot impact on the game. It's a lot of little things that I've noticed over time that just kind of build up. Also there's a trading rule for some reason? I'm not sure if it improves the game or not because nobody wants to do it.

The game that taught me to stop cringing at the phrase "worker placement"! Sure, one could apply another theme to the game's mechanics (as the critics say), and it would still work, but the fact is that Euphoria *does* work so well, plus looks and feels great. So many decisions, so many consequences... so much replayability.

The game itself was a lot of fun.  Worker placement where the workers are 6 sided dice and are rolled throughout the game. If the total of pips on all of your workers are too high they are smart enough to realize the dystopia they are in and leave - cool!  The only knock I had on the game was the amount of time it took to complete a game.  The box suggested 1 hour and we were 3.5 hours in with 6 person game with experienced gamers.

I really wanted to like this game. It seemed like it checked a lot of boxes for us, but as a two player game, it did not work for us on so many levels.

RATING: 4
I like the art, the theme, and the components (though the board might be a bit too busy,) but I think there are some clashing combinations here that just don't suit me.  It's a race game, which is fine, but efficiency is king here, and gaining what are essentially extra actions just through rolling well (doubles/not losing workers) or drawing the right cards feels excessively luck oriented to me.  

Also, I think the early game might just be a little too rough for the kind of game this is.  I like the market mechanic, but losing efficiency early to someone who is rolling better could mean falling hopeless far behind, as happened to one player in our game.  There were just too many punitive markets for him to be able to do anything in the 2nd half of the game. Playing out the 2nd half of a 90 minute game with very little chance to win is not a good time, and while that can happen in many board games, it is especially painful in this one.  I suspect that doubles is in there partially as a comeback mechanic for people who are really far behind, but it can just as easily both create and exacerbate the problem.

I'd call it an interesting misfire, but I wouldn't be especially excited to play it again.

The theme is excellent, and the artwork is outstanding. A worker dice placement design with some interesting strategies.

It appears that the Green faction is way too strong, and the random luck of picking your two opening factions is deeply flawed (it can doom a lone faction). It happened to me, and without support or synergy, I finished in last place and simply didn't enjoy the experience at all (so typical of Stonemaier, too much chrome and not enough game).

Has the potential to be a terrific game, but really needs a revamping (note: expansion module forthcoming, but too late: Sold).

There are a lot of decisions to make, so you can get kind of paralyzed. That said, it was pretty fun and I would play it again, especially with someone who's really into worker placement.

tl;dr: quite nice

Here's another game that recycles a lot of well known elements: gathering resources, worker placement blahblahblah... and while it isn't exceptional, it works quite well. There are some nice twists with the way the markets come in to play and the bumping of player pieces. It doesn't really do anything new, but it's enjoyable enough and the weight to length ratio is pretty good.
A small point on the bits: I'm not a fan of the design on the board. It makes the nice artwork look ugly. And did they really need to spend extra money on making custom bits for the hearts and the heads? It's nice of course, but it's also complete overkill. In this case a lower price point would have been a far better option that souping up the bits.
If this is the kind of game we can continue to expect from Stonemaier games, I'll be very happy to play their future offerings.

Just deeply uninspiring. I quite liked how the numbers you rolled were almost entirely irrelevant; as though it was a dice game designed by someone who feels that they have terrible luck with dice and so minimised the effect it would have and then, where it does make a difference, you want to roll low numbers. But in that case, why bother using dice at all? (Oh, that's right, it was on Kickstarter and so the custom dice were a selling point).

In our play, one player lost a die on turn 3, with 2 dice in play and knowledge adding 4 to his roll, he rolled a 12 which cost him a worker and basically eliminated him from play. Half of the table took workers who were Subterrans or the cloud people, meaning that the 2 who didn't were left behind as the others co-operated to flip their hidden characters and place points quickly. The one guy whose early ability seemed massively overpowered won and I came a relatively close second by spamming the same three actions for over 80% of my turns (one of those actions was to retrieve my dice every three turns). That does not result in a fun play.

As for the resource tokens; they're pretty if more than a little garish and I'd be perfectly happy just using coloured cubes. The spreadsheet track to multiply your resources is a (clever) fudge for the fact that the pimped resources were clearly too expensive and so they didn't supply enough.

Final thought: I mostly dislike Kickstarter games for their lack of development. I'm shocked (shocked!) to discover that the rules changed after release; the cost of a morale to place doubles in one turn really should have been in the ruleset from day one. Kickstarter publishers: your customers are not your play testers!

Played a few times. A little disorienting with a large number of symbols, effects, and seven commodities plus artifacts, characters, and workers. It is worker placement, and your workers are 1-4 dice (start with 2); but if your workers available ever add up to 16, you lose one; the number of placement points it huge. It seems like a train wreck of a game at first, but it's starting to make sense. Beautiful bits, but only in the kickstarter version.

1. The Deluxe version is truly deluxe. The pieces are amazing.
2. I'm in the game - I discovered a boardgame artifact!

This is a worker placement game. Now, I'm normally pretty middle of the road with this mechanic, but I really enjoy this game. The variable markets and recruits means that every game will need a little different approach (though not so much as to make your approach feel like a different game each time). The workers as a die approach is fun as it means there is a little press your luck (or manage your luck I guess) in that you can lose workers if the dice totals are too high. Like most euros, the theme is not everything, but it makes a little more sense than most and is fun.

Be warned. The game will be going along and then suddenly over. For me, most Stonemaier games are like this, so the pacing of the games takes a play to understand well.

Fun, quick, balanced, interactive, on the edge of your seat, competitive to the last breath, with just enough luck not to make it into a number-crunching game. In the medium euro market it's probably one of the best worker placement I've ever played.

EDIT: later plays showed that its *fastness* is what made it fun, not its strategic depth. It's the best in the medium-LIGHT market, i.e. I like it better than Stone Age. Viticulture+Tuscany is actually better, and Alien Frontiers+Factions does the dice placement better as well.

I like Euphoria a lot. It's a fun and very unique worker placement game. It's fine as 2-player, but the game really shines with four, and probably really, really shines with six. I can't also say enough about the component quality; it's top-notch and the deco-style art is excellent.

The game moves at a pleasantly fast pace. However it's really hard to interfere with your coplayers' plans let alone anticipate your coplayers' plans. I think that rolling doubles, triples or even quadruples is an enormous advantage. Having only one action at a time and waiting until it is your turn again versus someone having two, three or even four actions at a time is frustrating and unbalances the game. I was pretty much in the lead,but it only occured once during the game, that I had dice with the same number. Another player had this happen 4 or 5 times during the game and he not only caught up on me but overtook me for the victory. (And I had more dice/workers to roll) This is just so random and I wouldn't have liked it if the distribution of doubles, triples, quadruples had been the other way around! Otherwise outstanding artwork and gaming components even with the retail version.

Out of the gate Euphoria was a winner.  Amazing components, strong game play an mechanics. Which initially a little intimidated by the board, after watching videos and reading the rule book, it's an easy to learn and teach euro.  I foresee this hitting the table a lot more than most games. 

The Recruits give the game a huge amount of variety and can completely change your play style or strategy for the game.  Played a few more games back to back and each time the recruits set me up for completely different play styles.  

Stonemaier knocked this out of the park.

This takes a little getting used to given the triple-layered economy but once you're over that, it works very well.

Strict Eurogamers won't like the element of randomness (particularly the "knowledge" mechanic limiting how many workers you have, which creates quite a heavy edge condition on the result of a dice role). However there is plenty to enjoy in it as a resource-management and the game really rocks its theme.

I liked it but as with Scythe (another SM game) it just didn't take on the first play. His games tend to have lots of little decisions that at the time don't feel impactful, but actually its very important to keep your focus and eyes on the prize. This makes the game deceiving at its first pass so i would like to give it one more go.

Kickstarter edition. Top-notch material, really beautiful ! But was utterly disappointed :(
I really wanted to like this game, but here is what I think: 
_ The game itself seem totally unbalanced with the recruits and some other mecanisms
_ Nearly impossible to overthrow someone in the lead.
_ Not enough interaction, thus cannot really prevent someone from winning. 
_ Not enough play with the value of the dice (having a 6 doesn't mean having a better worker. There is no point in that except with the "lucidity" factor). 
_ Losing a worker is damn painful (especially when you're unlucky enough to lose one with only two workers). Not participating in a construction site is quite the handicap too.
_ Despite turn being quite fast, the game seems slow.

Here's a cool game, with a cool theme and cool bits (I have the KS edition) and cool artwork and it makes you feel cool when you are playing it. Yep I like it. 

[imageid=554375]
I actually thought that I had this game rated and had already given it the thumbs down for 2 players. I thought I was coming in here to update my comments and confirm that yes this is a thumbs DOWN game for 2 players. Then I see I hadn't even rated the game. Whoops. Well I've played several 2 player games now (3 I think) and I really don't like the game at all with 2 players. I wouldn't bother at 3 players either. 4 is a simple minimum for this one and 5 or 6 is preferable which is weird because I generally speaking like games to play fewer players rather than more. This game just shines so beautifully with more players. The negotiation aspect of it really comes out and makes the game take on a whole new direction rather than just simple work placement/resource management. Love this game but will never play with 2 players again.

I enjoyed playing Euphoria, but I'm not really sure how much I'd enjoy playing it again. There is a lot of interesting stuff here, but too much random.

You're playing a worker placement game where you use dice to claim spots. But whenever you take workers back home you have to roll them and if the sum of all your dice and your intelligence rating exceeds 16 then your smartest idle worker wises up and runs away. The goal of the game is to get all your stars placed on the board first. There are several ways to do that, which mostly involve gathering resources or cards.

My problem with the game is that this thing is just chuck full of randomness. At the beginning of the game you get four special power cards and keep two. One is visible and active and the other is hidden. Some of these cards are just flat out better than others. And if you're lucky enough to get two of the same color, then you can push that color track to get a star on both cards which is huge. In my game myself and one other person both had two cards of the same color. The other two players didn't. Additionally our colors were the same as each other. Which meant we both had a vested interest in pushing that color as hard as possible. That was a huge advantage for us.

Additionally when you place a die in certain spots and someone else takes that spot, you get your die back without having to take a retrieve action. Which meant that while Dan and I were pushing up the Yellow track, we kept bumping each other off the same spot... which meant we had to take fewer retrieve actions than the other players.

Placing stars in a lot of locations required three cards or two matching cards. I got a lot of matching pairs which other players didn't. There was one spot that required a certain card, which I got but other people didn't. Lucking into the right cards can help a lot

When you roll doubles, triples, etc. you get to place all the matching dice, while everyone else has to place one at a time. The second place player rolled doubles seven or eight times whereas other players did it one or twice.

Speaking of special powers, my main power was one that let me pay gold when bumping people out of spots and get cards... which let me build a card engine which was terribly powerful. Another player could sacrifice a die to place two stars at once. Those powers blew away the other two player's powers.

It felt like there was more random in the game than there was not-random. While it was fun and enjoyable, I can't see myself enjoying this as much if luck wasn't going my way. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Struck me as JASE, but with some weird and rather minor randomness. (That's "minor" from a game design standpoint, as in, you could probably remove it. Having your third worker die because you rolled bad is annoying in a less minor way.)

It's a worker placement game (with lots of placement options and the feeling of there being no "big moves") and also a race game. The placement part of the game feels loose (little sense of constraint or interaction) so the tension seemingly must come from the racing component.

The theme is bizarre, which is fine, but the integration into the mechanics is weak and doesn't help you learn the game. E.g. you have a frequently adjusted "morale" score whose main purpose is to allow you to hold more artifacts (stuff like teddy bears and baseball bats) at a time (so, hand size). Morale goes either up or down when you retrieve your workers, based on whether you pay a resource.

Also you roll dice with gears on them to determine how intelligent your workers are each time you deploy them, and if you roll too high you lose a worker. I had no idea that any of this was what was (thematically) happening until after the game when I had a chance to read about it. Really bad.

One thing I did like is that players can cooperatively choose to build new worker placement spots, and only those who contributed to its construction can use it. And further, until the other players pay some extra cost, there's a game-wide negative effect on them. This is a nice kind of player interaction.

Less pleasing are the tracks that can cooperatively be advanced, as whether you can benefit, and whether anyone is going to be helping you advance your tracks of choice, is largely based on two cards you picked at the beginning of the game. (Those cards also have annoying special powers.)

Ironically, in Euphoria the player is tasked to literally act out the theme of the game as the worker/player in a dystopian world.  The labor/play concludes after a series of tasks that connect mechanically but fail to arrive at anything  that feels satisfying or like a resolution.

Most of the game is OK, but doesn't really rise above "OK," and there are some problematic parts. It is not at clear that the different areas are well-balanced, for example. 

I'd rate it a bit higher if there were any coherent theme to the game at all, but there really isn't. There is essentially no dystopian flavor to the game, and even if one takes that part on faith, it's entirely unclear what the players are supposed to be DOING in the game world.

I entered into the world of Euphoria extremely excited. It has the most amazing components I have ever seen and with the promise (from others) of exquisite game play, the hype was there. I was ready. 

What I found was a serious mess. This is a race game where all the players are on unequal starting positions. This would be all fine and dandy if as a group we could collectively peg the leader back. Unfortunately, even though it's a "worker" placement game, there's no blocking in this game. Not only this, but if you roll doubles, then you get to take extra turns. If you roll extremely low, you're improving your chances as well. 

The game made so little thematic sense that when people talk about pasted on theme, I think of this game. Workers are shown by their intelligence, denoted by the pips on the die. I don't know how they don't get smarter the longer they experience the real world, nor do I understand why you have to re-roll their intelligence once you recall your workers.

I left Euphoria disappointed. Disappointed and unwilling to return.

Update: I read that the cards are getting a re-balance. Props to the designer on that, but it does make you wonder why this wasn't developed and tested properly in the first place.

RATING: 5
As much as I've wanted to enjoy this game I'm sad to say it just didn't jive with m e.  For reasons I've been trying to pinpoint.  Think it's a combination of there not feeling like dice rolls carry enough weight to them, while at the same time the luck in the game can be frustrating.  This is coming from someone who enjoys randomness in games.  There's too many finicky little elements to worry about that don't really feel cohesive in the game.  

Roll your dice, check to make sure you're under the knowledge track total, can't go there because your numbers are too high, guess you'll go here instead, don't forget that you get a bonus there, but only if you get your worker card flipped, oh and don't forget the obscure ability he grants you, or the negative effects on buildings you didn't participate in.  Get one resource, turn it into another resource, trade that resource in to build a building.

Overall it just felt tedious and un-exciting and more like a chore to setup, play and put away.

RATING: 7
Theme is great.  Names on the cards are awesome, and the building structures and various resources make sense given the theme.  Though this is worker placement, here it actually makes some amount of sense, rather than feeling like an abstract mechanic glued on because it's trendy.  Euro mechanics that turn commodities into resources are dry and boring in a normal game, but that feeling is great for a industrialized dystopian future where the goal is a repeatable process: input + labor = output.

It's more tightly balanced than most other Kickstarter games I've played.  Some ways of obtaining points are easier, but those are generally open to all of the players equally.  The uniqueness of making workers dice and having to risk losing a worker in order to operate at maximum efficiency is great.  There's also interaction in trying to predict where you can get your workers back from where other people will want to bump them off.  

Unfortunately, the game can be fragile.  High die rolls may be unlikely, but they're crippling if they happen.  In addition, the markets that come out can completely wipe out your strategy if you don't get on the right ones, which is both completely unpredictable and nearly uncontrollable.  If players are prepared to roll with the punches, this can be assuaged.

Worker placement + dice + race + theme...what more could I ask for! 

If I'm honest, the theme of this game probably brings it from a 6.5 to a 7. The game is beautiful, and I just love the flavor of dystopia. The knowledge (worker losing) mechanic can be a bit random and might be too luck based, and double dice rolls are probably too powerful, but I haven't played it yet enough to experience too much hardship. I think a house rule to require spending morale to use your 2nd same-faced die may be a good fix (as I've seen suggested here on BGG).

A dice game that isn't really a dice game, since for the most part the # you roll doesn't matter. A worker placement game that isn't really a worker placement game, since for the most part you can't get locked out of going where you want to go. In the course of my one play I went from being completely bewildered by all the different areas on the board to feeling like I'd seen all there was to see by game end. It's OK- I just wonder how many real choices there are in the game. It felt like my strategy was determined by the cards I drew at the beginning (albeit, draw 4 pick 2).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The design seems sound enough, but it's not as engaging as I was expecting it to be.  On the one hand, the value of the die rolls not being important for placement (save for losing a worker and the few resource spots) is useful, but at the same time, you have to wonder what the point is of having dice for workers if the rolls aren't somehow important.  I already own Alien Frontiers, and I can't see myself choosing to play Euphoria if I have the choice between the two games.

First Impression: This is a worker placement game where colored dice play the role of the workers. While the core concept of what one does on his turn is extremely simple, there is a ton of possible actions and paths for one to consider. In fact, if it wasn't for the superb production and graphic depection of all the actions one could be overwhelmed by the display of information. An excellent worker placement game with straight forward goals (place ten stars) which requires deep thinking. Certainly not an entry level game, but one which more experienced euro players should thoroughly enjoy.

Looks overwhelming in the beginning. Played 5 x within a week. =D Pretty quick game with quite a bit of thought process involved. 

"Good" dice rolls can kill you though. Rolled 3 x 6's and had to remove 2 of my workers.

I like the cards as they change what you do every game and give you a bit of direction. Also, as there are only 2-3 personalities each game, I feel it is better than agricola occupation/improvement cards. I believe some are unbalanced though. 

Main gripe about it is that there is pretty much no way to stop the leader from winning the game. Once a person had 9 influence, there is no way to block him off from getting his last influence out on the board.


Sold off to thin down my worker placement games to someone who would get more plays from it.

RATING: 6

This is a gorgeous game that I honestly haven't played enough to quite determine if I actually like it or no.
The theme is about 70-80% there for me,
and all the pieces seem to Fit in the clockwork, But:
I haven't quite had the alarm bell go off on this one yet.

Still, based on the merits of the campaign:

Verdict: Success

(12) dice worker placement game... beautiful board, medium heavy game with tough decisions and choices to gain authority

RATING: 8
Fantastic theme, so fitting for how I view the intentions of our current leadership in the States.  So refreshing to have a worker placement game not feel like a worker placement game with the clever twists of the mechanics. I will probably drop the rolling doubles benefit to tame the luck factor. Watched it played a couple times, can't wait to put it on the table.  I'd love to get my hands on the deluxe kickstart edition.

A surprisingly decent Euro, with some funky theme. A lot going on, but it's a dice/worker placement game where you're collecting resources to achieve certain win conditions and trigger powers. A lot to take in at first.

This is really unique in worker/dice placement genre! It has some cool mechanics paired with an interesting theme. One might get a bit lucky with the artifact card draw but other than that this is really fun and quick dice placement game, even with 5p.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not a bad game... but a bit sterile gameplay for my taste. The board looks impressive but you easily forget the theme 5 minutes after you start playing it and spend most of your time saying: "ok.. I need a yellow cube, so I have to get for that this and then that... and after an hour... ok, I won" :P and in fact it was me who one most of the games :P Its not that it is not a challenging game but its like watching the source code of an euro game. I am definitely not the target, but its a nice game I can still play but will not suggest on my time to choose the game.

Mechanics fall short of potential. Worker intelligence is only partially used. Faction bonuses aren't really bonuses and are not balanced.

RATING: N/A
Really like the dice as worker placement mechanic. The board looks cluttered at first but quickly makes sense. Components are simply the best I've ever seen in a game. Gameplay is fast, but somehow still not quite exciting. Strong leads can be hard to overcome and there really isn't any catch up mechanic.

My active Kickstarter project - ending soon! act now! - is to raise $500k to purchase the rights to all previously released Kickstarter games, then test/develop them so that they actually work.

The many negative comments about [i]Euphoria[/i] are all true,  though they are partly balanced out by the fact that the game plays quickly.

RATING: 3.5
I was very excited for this one, but it ended up falling flat. Granted, the circumstances weren't great (full 6p, most of us new, and it was late) but I didn't feel like it did anything exciting in the "dice as workers" genre or that the decisions were particularly interesting, especially for the time taken. The game was long and really felt like it was dragging. Maybe 3 fast, experienced players can finish in an hour, but with 6 mostly newbies, we had no chance of even coming remotely close.

edit: Played again with 4p and it wasn't any better. A dull, tedious game.

The recruit card selection at the beginning weighs more than it should.  Guess it wrong and you'll have very little chance to win.  

or park a die (with 4 or more) on the other guys commodity area and he can no longer get the 1-4 option that allows advances on the allegiance track. you're out a die but the shutdown you inflict on him more than compensates for it.

I really love the theme and wanted to like this game. Come on Stonemaier!

Ordered/Shipped 19 Feb from The Games Capital. Collected 23 Feb 15.

NEED TO CHECK IN PROPER LIGHT BUT APPEARS BOARD IS SPLIT

UPDATE 14/4/15. Not split, but is damaged slightly - board peeled from backing partly along one edge and the corner which appears on upside (i.e. game play side) is damaged.  Not dramatic and does not affect game play, and I will fix it with a few spots of glue, but it is disappointing.

14/10/15 - Update - 24/9 I GMed Jamey and them filled in Stonemaier Games' form for a new board - replacement board promptly shipped from Germany and collected today - cannot fault their level of customer service.

Would've been so awesome to be in on the Kickstarter for this one. The designers treated their backers to a deluxe set of tokens and all sorts of extras. I doubled my contribution for another game that may not get as much play time as this one probably will. All these guys asked for was an additional $20 for their fancy tokens.

Anyone curious about this game, I highly recommend you watch the first 10-15 minutes of Rahdo's gameplay runthrough (part 1).

** This game is so easy to learn. The board layout is so intuitive. Its design has been very well thought out. The designers of Viticulture certainly have their work cut out for them! I scored it 8/10 and that's with just me play testing by myself to learn it. I'm bringing this to my next "Meaty Gaming" event, for sure!

*** Turns out, this was a fast favorite at my FLGS. It's great because it supports up to 6 players and interaction between players is high. It's really a great and balanced game that encourages competitive play while remaining light enough to laugh and really enjoy every aspect of the game.

Yay, I got the KS Deluxe edition! I docked it 0.5 points simply because it only adds to the aesthetics, overall. And since I already picked up the original Stonemaier Treasure Chest, I had some spiffy, realistic resource bits. Still, it's a beautifully produced game and it was still in new condition.

Absolutely love this game.  The theme is a lot of fun and the realistic tokens really make the game pop.  They help to keep you in the theme of the game.  You say "I'm going to take gold.  Oh yeah!  That feels like a gold brick!"  The game is good with 2, better with 3 great with 4, and IMO fantastic with 5.  As long as all 5 know how to play.

A medium weight 2-6 player worker placement game. Players control dice as workers, using them to gather and spend resources without letting them get to smart for their own good. Players can also dig tunnels, construct markets, and gather artifacts of the world gone by the influence the elite and gain victory.

A really enjoyable theme. Slightly confusing iconography and placement spaces at first but we got into it. The quality of the board and pieces is excellent. It's an interestingly open ended game that I'd like to play some more to explore various paths through it.

This was interesting to play, but I will need to play it again to see how it works out then. Our first play was so even that it made me a bit suspicious about how it will play in the future. Hopefully it will only get better with repeat play.

The game looks a bit of a mess to me, but it has a fun theme, and the actions make sense in that theme, even if they feel like trading one cube for a cube of another color.

I got the Kickstarter Supreme Edition and I think this game is beautiful. The components and especially the resources are amazing. If you missed the Kickstarter, but you want the beautiful ressources, then you can order very, very similar ones now on the Stonemaier Games website. 

The gameplay mechanics are great. A dice-worker placement game where you can't be blocked to go on a field, but sometimes there's an advantage on being first, because then you can get bumped out and use that worker again.

The rules are quite easy to learn (especially when I compare it to other games I play with my gaming group), but when you play it the first time the choices where you want to place your workers can be a bit overwhelming. 

Conclusion: I would definitely recommend it.

First impression: I really wasn't sure enough how I felt about this to rate it, but I want to capture my initial thoughts about it.  It has some very interesting mechanisms that (for me) didn't gel into an interesting game.
Strike 1: The dystopian theme puts me off, which I could ignore if the rest of the game is worth it.
Strike 2: The way the dice actually worked didn't thrill me.
Strike 3: The engine building seems like it will give good replay value, but can produce very lopsided play experiences.  In the long run, I'm sure this is a great feature if you really dig the game.

This sounds pretty damning, but the respectable elements of the game keep it in an "I'd play it another time or two" zone.  With luck, I'd end up really digging it.

We found it mediocre. It just doesn't have the oompfh it needs to differentiate itself. While the gameplay is decent, the theme lacks throughout the game. More could have been done with moral choices and to colour the factions so they would be more different. Characters seem to add an unbalance to the game.

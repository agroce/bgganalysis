I'm a fan of TS, and since then 1989 - so I was really looking forward to this.  Perhaps I should give the solo version a go - but in the 2 player games I've played so far (about 3 or 4) it's been loads of euro style dice rolling, I've found it hard to come up with a strategy and the bottom line - it's just not been fun!  Mine's going on ebay!

Yet to play face to face so rating based on solo plays only. Just couldn't warm to this and really wanted to as Wilderness War is a favorite. Solo seemed disconcertingly random. One of the best produced GMT games IMO and rules admirably clear. If I ever get a face to face game I might change my mind.

My current go-to solo and overall favorite board game! Interesting theme which is reflected in the gameplay, great component quality, clear concise rules and player aids, and a decent variable game length (I average about 1-3.5 hours for 1-3 deck runthroughs). With over 10 plays in 3 months, the experience has yet to be dull (and I have only been playing with the balanced default scenario!). Labyrinth is a must for any gamers' collection, with an expansion on the way which promises to add even more content!

Decent enough game. Some uncomfortable ideology is captured in the design. A lot of value judgements in there about the nature of terrorism.

I tend to play heavier games solo and the flow chart fuckery was just too much. More administration than game really. I'm certain it is better in 2-player, but no one ever seemed keen.

I am making an effort to record every game of Labyrinth we play.

We're five games in so far, and I feel pretty comfortable giving this a 7.  I think I enjoy it more than Twilight Struggle (since I don't obsessively calculate and recalculate world standing in Labyrinth like I do in TS), but I don't think I can give it an 8 since "I would never turn down a game" isn't true.  I still have to be ready for at least a two-hour game for this, which isn't an everyday thing.  Maybe that will change with time, though.

Update: I think I might actually enjoy Twilight Struggle more?  I don't know what to think any more!

Initial thoughts.

Played both times as the US.

I really like the asymmetry. It gave me lots to think about and will make the game less of a back and forth once I will become comfortable with the moves/decisions available to me. It also makes for good replay-ability.

Although I was very immersed in the mechanics and how to play (as it was a first game) I can see how with more games under my belt, the theme will start to mesh with the mechanics and make for a good storytelling game. I like that aspect of games.

My dice rolling was poor throughout the game but I like the element of chance/luck in this game. It feels like there is more of it than in Twilight Struggle though. But it also felt like both sides had a similar level of luck.

It felt very tense at times. Which is good! For example, weighing the decision to let plots happen in order to save the operations points for longer term plans was delicious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably the easiest card driven game I have played.  You won't beat a shark, but you can get a feel for strategies quickly, even if you don't understand the card interactions.  It has some similarities to [thing=12333][/thing] including very much not feeling like a war game.  

The 2-card mechanic is interesting.  The biggest rush is playing a deadly 2-card combo.

RATING: 8
The small CDG tweak of each side playing two cards in a row really changes the dynamics of wending through your hand on any given turn. I much prefer Labyrinth over a game like Twilight Struggle because it doesn’t feel like having the deck memorized is a huge advantage. Being aware of the unplayed major cards is certainly a benefit, but it seems like you’re much more playing and reacting to your current hand and board position than worrying about culling the deck of powerful events. Difficult decisions abound related to the many levers and pulleys available to the two sides. A high-tension experience every time out.

RATING: 3.6
:snore: :snore: I learned this in the same week I learned Twilight Struggle. This just confused and bored me, whereas TS was an instant hit and even my non-gamer significant other prefers TS to 1775: Rebellion and 1812: The Invasion of Canada, which I wasn't expecting (other than perhaps her ability to commit DEFCON suicide to end it when she is bored, but she hasn't done that yet)

RATING: 8.5
The start of his COIN series. 

A very good game with lots of thematic flavour. Both players have their differences in terms of execution of actions to repercussion of failure in getting certain actions done. 

Unlike a wargame, this do not have a frontline per se. Deploy and recruit. Do the maximum damage and move on. The US forces do have a good chance to win if they could hold certain high value countries. Making sure the plots are not too damaging to the time table. 

Have not tried solitaire.

RATING: 7.5
Played only Solo. Great game, system, components, rules but... you have to match yourself (and continuosly) the quite twisted rules with the Solo flow/sequence of play. Overall the heaviness of game management is not balanced by the satisfaction and excitement provided by the Solo system.

Frequently compared to Twilight Struggle, but I prefer Labyrinth much more. As a CDG, you do need to be very familiar with the deck to play well, but once you understand just how asymmetrical the two sides are, you realize the infinite variety of strategies and all the different ways a game can go. Yet for all that it seems very subject to luck, skill does show in who wins more consistently. A great game that is deeply thematic, if not necessarily a realistic simulation of global politics, but certainly a thinking game. I never tire of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is thematically rich, and really an impressively audacious design. The dice play a LARGE roll, but there are so many rolls that it tends to even out over time. The tension of hand management is nowhere near as intense as it is in TS, but still definitely present. A good game bordering on great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I am at odds with the COIN series. "Fire In The Lake" feels like an over-complex eurogame and reminds me of El Grande. I can't bring the theme in sync with the mechanics. As a wargame about Vietnam, it did not work for me (so far). But within Labyrinth's theme of "War on Terror" the whole eurogame/wargame mix works surprisingly well and feels right. The AI for solitaire play is a lot of fun and makes for suspenseful game sessions. I am impressed.

Always tense, and somehow always close, yet the better player wins. the most asymmetric CDG ever; no use of ops is possible for both players, and even the basic mechanism for using ops is different.

Uses the TS system where opponent's events trigger before or after you use the ops, which I really like.

[u]Pros[/u]:
* Beautiful map and counters.
* Different operations are okay, but could have been simplified.
* Status and quality of government are represented.

[u]Cons[/u]:
* Cubes and cylinders are for eurogames.
* Two cards plays is a bit odd. Why is that?
* Labyrinth is clearly derived from [gameid=12333], but it lacks its inventivity, cutedgeness and sharpness.
* No timelime.
* No scripting.
* Too large unsplit deck, makes cards drawn too randomn.
* What is the point of removing cards, if you only play the scenario where you only go once through the deck?
* The Jihad side of the war on terror is represented as a dark evil mysterious force sneaking around the globe. That is far aside the reality, I believe. The Middle-East situation is much more complex. The games reveals the view of the designer.
* Recent Arab revolts are not represented here and overthrows the credibility of the game.
* Why not a 9/11 card to start the game with?
* This game represents a twisted view of reality!

I condemn this game!

Rating is sort of provisional, but having only played a couple of games, and only as the Jihadis, I'm loving this. I hope to play & enjoy it lots more so I can make it a firm 9. 

Games have been tight and the card combo opportunities really make it shine in my eyes. There may be occasions where luck could outweigh good play, but so far good play (or poor play!) has determined the results in our games.

There is a lot going on in this game.  Rarely has a game had both the theme and the mechanics to keep me so engrossed in how it plays.  The presentation is superb.  I'm not sure I'd classify this as a war game (more of a strategy/political title), but I sure enjoy both playing it, and thinking about it...

Good Gaming~!  Mick

Un CDG rápido que para mí está muy por debajo de otros muchos CDGs del mercado. 

Soy un apasionado de la mecánica CDG, me gusta mucho, pero aunque este juego es bastante rápido de jugar, nunca encuentro un buen momento para él y eso solo puede significar una cosa... 

Aspectos buenos.

- Bien pensado y equilibrado. Tiene decisiones interesantes.

- Es rápido. En una tarde se puede jugar una partida si ambos jugadores saben jugar.

- Diseño correcto (pero los cubitos no me van nada...) y buenos materiales en general.

Aspectos no buenos.

- Tiene mecánicas poco intuitivas y farragosas en algunos aspectos que le hacen perder agilidad como CDG rápido.

- Tema más pegado de la cuenta. Eventos algo pobres. Hay ratos que parece que estás jugando un eurogame.

- Como simulación (el autor lo propone como tal) es decepcionante.

- En general es poco inmersivo (al menos para mí). Me cuesta ver en conflicto que representa (solo veo cubos negros y beige).

- El conflicto que recrea me resulta poco interesante (pero esto ya es un problema mío).


  Como corolario final decir que el trabajo de este diseñador, en general, no me acaba de convencer (opinión totalmente personal).

Very good game. I'm a huge fan of Twilight Struggle and this provides a foil and follow up experience. The level of randomness from the need to make constant die rolls is a big difference to TS, but as a mechanic echoes the frustration of the operations both sides feel. I did get a little uncomfortable with the theme, when playing the Jihadists - feeling a sense of success for setting a plot off on US soil, for example - but this was off set by the insight and understanding into the real world challenges that the game provides. Highly recommended, with a +1 to the roll (D6G style) if you like Twilight Struggle.

Rated after three plays. A tight, nuanced, clever design that captures an incredibly complex and long-term conflict. The role of dice in the game has a clear logic and makes perfect sense in the game's context. The entire gameplay model is built around a strong, well-articulated set of assumptions about its controversial subject matter. I think this is a home run.

RATING: 7
Sorsszerű, hogy épp szeptember 11-én játszottam vele, egyáltalán nem direkt időzítettünk így, egyszerűen így alakult. A kétszemélyes változatot próbáltam, ez alapján értékelem, de állítólag az 1 személyes is közel ugyanezt az élményt adja (megjegyzem az a diagram, ami a szóló változat működését leírja, elég durva, lehet hogy tovább tartott a szólót kidolgozni mint magát az alapszabályt).
Twilight Struggle-szerű, kártyavezérelt játék, téma a 2001 utáni terror elleni harc, döntően a közel-keletre fókuszálva. Nagyon tetszik a térkép, és nagyon jól átjön a tematika a mechanizmusokon. Szerintem sokkal összetettebb, mint a TS, többféle akció van, és totál aszimmetrikus az egész. Nekem azért annyira nem tűnt elsőre letisztultnak, mint a nagy előd, így míg a TS-ben simán benne van több 100 parti, itt ezt azért nem érzem (annak ellenére sem hogy többféle küldetés van, és létezik 1-2 személyes játékmód is). A partinkban én kényszerpályára kerültem egy nagy hibát követően, és látszott, hogy szinte esélyem sincs, hamarosan el is buktam. TS-ben ez azért nem nagyon következhet be így egyik pillanatról a másikra (kivéve az atomháborút).
Ami viszont jó, hogy nagyon sok újdonság van benne, ami jól működik. Pl. az hogy 2 lapot lehet egyszerre kijátszani, vagy a finanszírozás-presztízs működőse, a jól eltalált győzelmi feltételek, stb.
Összességében ajánlom mindeninek, aki a hasonló kártyavezérelteket szereti, nem fog csalódni.
A játékhossz szabályozható, mert legfeljebb 1,2,3 pakli elfogyásáig tarthat a játék. Így akár 5-6 órás is lehet, de bizonyos végefeltételek már 1 óra alatt is bekövetkezhetnek, de ahhoz azért komoly hiba kell szerintem.
Kiegyensúlyozottságot nem tudom megítélni, és amúgy is gondolom ez küldetésenként változó.

I'm wondering every game on what I have to do during my turn and so my opponent. The solo rules are boring as hell
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played 9 games and 2 solitaire game. I dislike the variability of the prestige rolls, and think there's a big chunk of luck, but the game is often over in 2 hours, so I still like it for now. I do think that the game is heavily biased towards the Jihadis, at least on the Let's Roll Scenario.

On the other hand, the game plays fast (we normally play 2 deck games, and it rarely goes past 90-120 minutes).

Update Summer '12 -- The C3i variant seems to have swung the balance of power towards the US. Many of my opponents are bothered by the lack of a clear direction and the big chunks of luck. Tempted to lower my rating

Rating -- Indifferent (after a few years of not playing).

Bought this while on Holiday in Adeliade, very good game, where one is the US pushing troops into Iraq and Afgansistan and the other is the Jihad terroists making trouble everywhere and getting their hands on nuclear weapons.  I much prefer to play the US side, but with a hard line attitude rather than the soft option, as you can set the tone of when and where you stop the Jihads, just very hard to withdraw troops from one region once you commit. So all in all a challenging game.

RATING: 9
Initial Impressions: This CDG takes asymmetry to a whole new level. Although the players share a common pool of cards, both sides use OPS point completely different. Multiple paths to victory keep this game fresh and exciting. Solo play is very challenging, without feeling too reactionary. 

10 Plays: I'm still loving this game. One of the brilliant and unique mechanisms is having to play 2 cards back-to-back. This allows for one to execute interesting combos. I'm still finding the game very well balanced. Solo play is made simpler with the aid of LWoTAi, a computer script. I've managed to beat the AI repeatedly so now I must bump it up a notch.

20 Plays: This is still my favorite political consim. At 20 plays, I'm beginning to see the subtleties of the game design. At this point I've abandoned the solo game and simply crave face-to-face play. I still haven't chosen a favorite faction, they both play so differently. The US sets the target numbers for the Jihadist's actions. The Jihadists end up setting the tempo of the game. Great fun.

30 Plays: What an amazing game! A this point I'm fairly certain that I prefer to play as the jihadists. With proper play, they can set the pace of the game as well as their opponent's focus. Be prepared to play aggressively though because giving the opponent to opportunity to catch their breath can quickly turn the tables in this delightful political dance. I've also acquired the Awakening expansion, which I believe will breath some new life into the game.

14 Games played now. The game is stunning.

Oh and btw. This is very much a politcial WARGAME in all of its playing mechanics. No discussion about that. It is just an adapted version of present day world war conflicts and how it is politically and military handled.

I think these kinds of NEW thematic games will further delve the graves of abstract Euro games for a LOT of people.

I even thought this game was made by a twisted mind ... until I saw the designer works as an analist for the CIA... 

No wonder this all makes sense. Actually compared to those 300 other games in my collection it needs a rating of 10.5...

Also: the majority of typical "down voters" claim mostly politically incorrect elements as the reasons why they dislike the game. Certainly the 2010/2011 comments are a laugh these days (of the "good" intentions of the Jyhad and the "bad" West etc ...). If anything this game was boosted back up in 2014 by the recent (terrible) events. Some card text makes me even shrudder. Brilliant game.

Like the COIN games, this has a really high learning curve.  It's not just the mechanics, it's also how you have to think about the game.  It's really easy to start thinking like this is a war game with your troops.  I've only played this game solitaire.  However, as soon as you can get a couple of plays under your belt and start catching the vision, learning the cards, and understanding the mechanics, it becomes pretty engrossing.

I HIGHLY recommend using the Python script to run the Jihadist flowcharts.  These help the solitaire game run quickly.  Now, if someone would just write one for the COIN series...

My rating to date is based only on my experience with the solitaire version of the game. I was teetering on giving it a 7 and relinquished an 8 at the end of the day. The system is pretty fun for my first experience with a game with "solitaire rules," and although I have not yet tried the different adjustments for AI difficulty it is nice that they are included as options. I bought this game based on its popularity but more so for the subject matter. It is pretty intriguing to me to play a war/strategy game with its subject matter being relevant to recent years in my lifetime. The asymetrical warfare is beautifully implemented game-wise.

A 2-player game is still pending but will probably happen soon, at which time my rating may change. I imagine the 2-player game to play similar to Twilight Struggle. We shall see.

Great 2 player abstracted game. This takes a pretty horrific theme (the war on terror) and abstracts in a way that I just love. The card system works flawlessly, although some of the cards have very terse descriptions. Each option that the 2 players can do, while very similar, are handled in unique ways. I also enjoy how each side has several ways they can win. This takes the Twilight Struggle system (which is my favorite game) and builds on it, creating a whole different experience. With several more plays, I will probably move this up to a 10. The game is extremely hard to teach, IMO, which is really the only reason my rating is staying at a 9 for now. Our game ended with the Islamist player winning in turn 5 by having the 6 resources. My next game will be solo with the included 1 player rules.

Excellent theme and use of real-world events.  Both the single and 2-player variant is fantastic.  Games can be run through a single deck (about 1.5 hours), up to three decks.

Multiple difficulty levels and scenarios in the single-player game.  I've played 4 times, and won 2/lost 2.  First game, I won by the slightest margin possible...pulling out the win on the last three cards.  

The next game, I got absolutely slaughtered.  But it was still fun watching the Middle East get riddled by Islamist Regimes.

What this game has done for me is to capitalize my interest in other GMT card-driven war games.  I have to find another one soon to add to my collection.

Labyrinth is a really good Card Driven Wargame ("CDG").  While it shares some similarities with Twilight Struggle ("TS"), the asymmetrical objectives and operations add an additional layer of complexity that makes it a little less accessible than TS.  If you are a fan of the CDG and are looking for a new challenge then Labyrinth may be for you.  Thus far, I have found it to be more luck dependent than the other CDGs that I have played, TS or H:RvC.

RATING: N/A
1 play (as Jihadists): reserving judgement, but intrigued, in particular by the asymmetry of the sides.  Went in with no strategic knowledge and basic rules knowledge.  

I did like having multiple paths to victory, but worry after reading reviews that having such differences might actually lead to very rigid play after "choosing a path."  

Rules were difficult to grok during the first couple readings.

Otherwise, looking forward to another play in a few weeks.

I played this as a 2-player game twice and came away underwhelmed. I love card driven games, but this one just felt clunky to me. The actual actions that I could take on a given turn felt repetitive and very dependent on random die rolls. I appreciate how these die rolls tie into the theme, but overall I felt like the game had good ideas but was too clunky for my tastes. I am still interested in trying it solo at some point, but this game just doesn't appeal to me enough to have a spot in my collection right now.

I have some mix feelings about this one.

As I can see the tension and the card managements factors of this I think the game is somehow boring.

You repeat most of your actions.

Played as US and I have to "answer" to Islamic actions. 

I will play it 1-2 times before I decide if this is a keeper or not. At this moment it isn't :(

----- UPDATE ------

Definitely grows on you. 
Excellent game. I still have some issues with it. Not a Balance issue, but when one side takes the lead (initiative) I still do not see how one can counter that.

Hats off to the designer to make a game on this particular conflict. And the game is actually very good. GMT has outdone itself on the production value on this one. I still prefer the simplicity of Twilight Struggle, but Labyrinth is a very interesting challenge as well.

The solo version is also very good and the AI is tough to beat.

Wow! Definetly better than I expected, although several plays are required to start making good moves and not doing nothing forbbiden by the rules. I'm eager to play Labyrinth again soon to assimilate all the rules and details, keep concepts and making the game flow softly.

* update *

Only too much luck on the die rolls keeps me reticent to rate this game with a 9 or more. This game is as fantastic in mechanics that it's a pity that most things are going to happen or not by dice rolls. But maybe with more experience the luck factor can be mitigated. 

* update *

It's a pity that my gaming buddies didn't fall in love with this great game, maybe because it has too many die rolls. That is making Labyrinth to stand in my shelves more time than what I desire.

I prefer to play Labyrinth over Twilight Struggle although I recognize that they are totally different games.

A fascinating model of the War on Terror, and a game I really wanted to like.  It's just not fun for me to play as a two player game.

One thing I don't like is that is really hard on the USA if their prestige drops early.  There are things you can do to bring it back, but you need to get lucky, and most of the time the game is nothing than a tedious slog while the Jihadist slowly goes through the motions of converting enough nations to Islamic rule to win.

Another thing is that most of the spaces on the board have almost no identity.  Central Asia--Afghanistan--Pakistan, and the spaces around them are usually the focus: those are the spaces the Jihadist will try to control to win the game.  Those spaces all have character, but most of the other spaces are quite generic: they might be referenced by an event or two, but it's not enough to make things distinctive.

I suspect Labyrinth is a better solitaire game: a lot of care seems to have gone into the solo rules.  It's just so hard to design a game that a solitaire AI can play that is also interesting for a human to play.  Labyrinth is a brilliant try at this, but I don't think it succeeded.

Superficially similar to Twilight Struggle, this CDG is rather more complex and will require several plays to get a feel for what to do with each side (this is a very asymmetrical game). The cards are also very similar in appearance and function to TS but the mechanics are very different. The array of actions can be bewildering and a lot of time is spent initially just trying to figure out what you want to do and then how to do it.

In the end a lot of the game boils down to die rolls and while there is some mitigation available for some of them, the key roll is for "posture" (either "Hard" or "Soft") and there is very little mitigation for it and one expects most of the world to end up "Soft." As there is an advantage for the US posture to be "Hard" in  meeting one of the "easier" victory conditions (eliminate all terrorist cells), the fact that the Global War on Terror index will be pegged hard against the US makes accomplishing anything very challenging as the US die rolls will have negative drms stacked against them even if their prestige is high (and that is difficult to maintain as well).

So, while all this maybe somewhat realistic, it makes for a frustrating game for the US side. Not impossible, but difficult. When things go relatively well one can't help feeling that it is only by virtue of a string of lucky die rolls and personally I'm not excited by that kind of game. Still, this is all based on only one session with the game but frankly I'm not drawn by either the theme or my experience with it to return any time soon.

Impresionante. Juego, para dos, con una estética similar a Twilight Struggle y mecánica de motor de cartas con puntos de operaciones y eventos, pero hasta ahí las similitudes.

No obstante, tanto el "ajedrez" que se genera como el "alma del tema" me generan un sensación de juego imprescindible y muchas ganas de rejugarlo.

Y, no puedo dejar de comentarlo: la tensión de controlar al bando yihaidista solo es comparable a comenzar a recibir correos electrónicos sobre el islamismo despues de hacer consultas a través de google sobre "war on terror" (verídico).

Early days...

So far so good. I like the simple rules, allowing the players to concentrate on the task at hand.  I like the two card mechanic and the combos it can produce. I like how it represents, in a simplified manner, 21st century global conflict as being as much if not more about persuasion and will than direct combat. I like the flexibility of game length given the 1,2 or 3 deck options. 

Dislikes...not too many. I get the same sense playing this as I do playing Twilight Struggle. That is, I like it for being the game that it is and I can appreciate it as such. However I am a wargammer, so a game like Lab or TS will only scratch the itch to a point. Does that make any sense? What I mean is an area influence game could never displace the best of the "true" wargames for me. Ugh...that sounds awful.

So far I'm lukewarm on Labyrinth.  It uses some interesting mechanisms, and does indeed try to simulate current geopolitics in a "realistic" way (that is, armed intervention is less important than the war of ideas), but it feels a little bland.  Perhaps it simply needs more plays, but thus far I've felt a distinct lack of things to do.  Each side has options that are pretty restricted, and often have a low chance of success.  Because both sides are mostly working indirectly, this means a lot of try and try again style action, with few if any "climactic" moments.  Given the subject matter of the game, this too feels "realistic," but my main question is if it is fun.  Perhaps a simulation of current geopolitics, with the concomitant murkiness and seeming immutability, is just not going to be that much fun.  Anyway, the game still intrigues me, but I'm not yet sold.

9/6/2011 - I can't stop thinking about this game. This has totally replaced Twilight Struggle for giving me a fun CDG experience. The game is so deep I'm not sure I'll ever feel I've totally mastered the nuances. That's a good thing and a bad thing though. It means the replay value is tremendous, but it also means I can't just crack it out on a whim with a couple of hours to kill. It can easily be a full-day event, especially using the "Tournament" and "Campaign" settings.

Last update: I've taken to playing the two-deck game, which is a huge improvement. Because of the way the game snowballs, you're never going to go that far into the second deck, and allowing the game to end naturally is much more satisfactory than the kinda silly endgame for the one-deck game. I'm completely happy with the two-deck game, and in practice it adds only a small amount of time.
---
More comments after another bout of play: it's odd the degree to which the game ends up revolving around Iraq, whether you want it to or not. It's an unstable, high-resource country ripe for the Jihadists, and as much as it might intuitively appear non-obvious, it's actually in the best interest of the US to invade as soon as possible, since it's the key to the region. Whether or not this is at all reasonable is left to the reader. Also, I'm not quite enamored of the endgame in the single-deck game, since it seems to encourage the Jihadists to time their Major Jihad for the last turn in the game if possible, when the US is actually legally barred from doing anything about it. Thus a huge incentive for the US to take their WMD Casus Belli and invade preemptively. Therefore despite my initial impressions, the 2-deck game may be be better.

Taking the game's Iraq obsession into account, Labyrinth does seem like a retroactive justification of US policies, a justification that feels forced and doesn't make much sense. As a reflection of reality, there is a very narrow window where Labyrinth makes any sense thematically, maybe from 9/2001 through the completion of the initial Afghanistan invasion. Other than that it aligns more with American right-wing fantasies and delusions than reality. And the recent Arab Spring has thrown into sharp relief just how questionable the foundations on which the game is based are.

Be that as it may, it's still a fun game which does reflect some elements of the post-9/11 world in interesting ways, at least from the US point of view. It has a lot of tension, gives the players lots of choices, and plays quickly. So I stand by my high-ish rating. I do wish it weren't so much about Iraq, though.

Last thing, I do agree with Brian that the Jihadists have to be considered significantly favored in a single-deck game. Not sure what that means.
---
I keep going back and forth of Labyrinth, but at the end of the day I've always enjoy my plays of it - a lot of tension in the game, and there are always interesting levers to pull. The thing I think Labyrinth does exceptionally well is to give you two very assymetric sides that are given equal narrative treatment. In Wildeness War or Hearts and Minds, for example, the narrative tends to focus on the British (or US), who have a detailed position in which a lot of their issues are gamed, while their opponents positions are much less nuanced. Labyrinth gives both sides equal treatment, which is pretty unusual.
---
I'll have to edit this down at some point; now that I'm  more plays in I like Labyrinth better. Getting *all* the rules right helps; there are a few little persnickety details that it's easy to miss but have significant impact (in our case, it was the fact that disrupting cells with troops gives you +1 prestige; this is not clearly called out on the reference card). Given the recency and the nature of the conflict being gamed, I wish Labyrinth was a little thematically edgier. It's also certainly true that the Labyrinth world is not particularly realistic - countries are much more susceptible to both Jihadis and US influence than is at all reasonable. But it had to be a game, and the pacing and tempo of the game works well, something that so many wargames can't pull off. I think it'll have a lot more staying power than Wilderness War did.
---
Second impressions of gameplay were much better. We had misplayed a recruiting rule slightly (largely because of the slightly odd choices on how the reference cards were done, it seems like they assumed the great majority of players will play solitaire), and getting it right made the geography of the game much more interesting. To really get a feel for this game you need to play both sides once.

There is the separate question of whether the game is thematically sound or a fair treatment of the subject material. I'm of mixed minds. I wish it were better, as I mention below. But I think it's OK.

I've lightly edited my below comments to reflect my updated impressions.
---
Initial impressions are positive but mixed. I have hopes Labyrinth will be improved by repeat play, but fear some apparent weaknesses may sink it.

The good stuff:
- The asymmetric ops play (where the US activate countries a la We the People while the Jihadists get a dice per op) is clever and effective. The Jihadists can always do stuff and their plays are cheap an incremental, while there are limited opportunities for important US plays like trying to drag Poor governments up to Fair.
- The focus on governance quality is thematic and works well, meaning the US plays a long game while the Jihadists are more tactical.
- The game seems to give you many legitimate levers to pull. The array of options (War of Ideas, Disruption, Plotting, cell recruitment and movement) all seem legit and to have their place in the game, and the system seem reasonably balanced. It definitely feels richer than 1960 or Twilight Struggle (of course, it ought to be, it's more complicated, but it seems to get better bang for the buck).
- The one-deck game is of sensible length. On the other hand, the 2 or even 3(!) deck games seem a little much. I don't know that there is enough game in here to support 4-6 hours of play. It also seems a little odd that the victory conditions don't change with game length.

The unfortunate parts are:
- The by-now standard reliance on over-specific event cards that favor Twilight Struggle style "photo-album" theme rather than more fundamental theme a la Hannibal. There are all these specific Iraq card tie-ins, for example, but while Iraq is geographically interesting, there are no WMDs and no particular reason for the battle to end up there. Once again, a smaller, more general but more focussed deck would have been thematically stronger.
- The thick deck with specific events means also means that to play well you have to know what's in there, as the deck defines the political geography in a way that seems more opaque than it needs to be.
- Also similar to Twilight Struggle, we're dealing with a fair amount of luck that is of coarse granularity and swingy. If the US gets just a couple good die rolls early and swings some important countries to Good governance, this has the potential to be huge.
- And finally, again similarly to Twilight Struggle, this game is very US-centric take on the conflict, almost to the point of narcissism, and it's a bit uncritical, right down to taking the term 'GWOT' seriously. Soft power is thematically virtually absent. Non-US nations are shells and coalition building is completely abstract. Domestic politics are a non-factor. The political impact of civilian casualties, such a key element of the conflict, are rarely seen - in Labyrinth, Predator drones never miss and only hit terrorists.

I realize that it would have been hard, perhaps even impossible, but I would have preferred harder-edged, truer theme. Something that did more to acknowledge the high price in lives paid by people who got caught in the crossfire, a game that explored the conflict in its ugliness and ambiguity with a little more guts and nuance. I actually have this complaint about WWII games also - I wish they were not as sanitized as they are, or at least, not always. But, WWII was at least about armies. The battle against violent anti-American religious extremism, in which fighting actual jihadis seems to have ended up being a relatively small part, is not. But you wouldn't really know that from playing Labyrinth. Even if they are called "terror cells" instead of armies, this is a game that has the feel of combat units moving around on a map and fighting each other.
---
I am looking forward to this one, perhaps not to surprising since I have a fondness for game which take challenging themes seriously and don't mind playing an occasional train wreck. I have some optimism for this, as Wilderness War was reasonably good. There are obviously a limited number of ways to do this game well, and a million ways to do it wrong. I saw the final version of this at GMT Game Day, and my impressions were positive - the components are great and the rules seem clean. But, thematically, I get the impression that the designers have shied away from really tackling the theme, instead going for a Twilight Struggle-esque "theme via copy text" approach, layering some evocative event titles on top of a relatively abstract game which avoids ambiguity in favor of a relatively straightforward "us vs them" thing. I think this is fair enough; this is probably about all a mainstream game could attempt to do really, so the proof will be in the actual gameplay more than whether it succesfully captures the nuances of a difficult topic. But again, to be fair, we'll know when we actually get to play it :)

RATING: 5
Just to be clear, my rating here isn't a reflection of the quality of this game, as the design is rather impressive.  It's just a reflection of my enjoyment/likeliness to play the game again.

I really enjoyed Twilight Struggle, so I thought I'd give this one a spin as it uses a similar system and has a cool theme.  While the system is indeed cool, Labyrinth just adds too much rulesiness for my tastes.  While I was able to read through the Twilight Struggle rules and play the game rather easily, we were always checking the rules with this one to see how to do things, or if we were doing things correctly.

If you're more toward the wargame end of the spectrum, you likely don't mind this at all.  However, I prefer the rules to be logical in my games, where I can read the rules, understand the game flow, and be off and running.  It turns out Twilight Struggle was probably right near the top of my complexity scale for this sort of game, and Labyrinth took it a step past what is enjoyable to me.

However, if you liked Twilight Struggle or other card-driven games and don't mind some added complexity, this will be a really cool game for you!  I really enjoyed the differences between the two sides in this game, such as the Jihad's turn results being a little less predictable than the U.S., and the various ways to win and focuses for each side.  That part is definitely more interesting than Twilight Struggle!  Unfortunately, I'm just not going to play it enough to be comfortable enough with the whole system to make it enjoyable for me.

[12/12/2009] Having played a couple of games, I have little doubt Labyrinth shall be the next CDG smash-hit and make it into the BGG Top5. It's on track to becoming my favourite CDG. Very accessible, juicy gameplay full of difficult trade-offs and a nuanced model of the "Global War on Terrorism". 

The design really drives home some valuable geopolitical lessons and hence strikes me as most educational. I'm impressed how well the game's mechanisms are tailored to the subject at hand. The highly asymmetrical and multi-faceted nature of this conflict is done full justice.

[11/9/2010] The game has changed quite a bit since 2009. While I'd have done things differently in a number of respects, there's no doubt this is an instant classic.

Very cool asymmetrical strategy game.  Cross the strategy/tenseness of Twilight Struggle with the asymmetry of Washington's War and then move the whole thing into the War on Terror era, and you have Labyrinth.

The theme intrigued me, and I was hoping it would scratch the same itch as Twilight Struggle, but it doesn't.  It's not so hard to avoid your opponent's events because of the many conditions on each card.  By the same token, it's hard to make good use of your own.  For the US, you need to roll 5s and 6s all the time.  If your precious modifiers tank, you're pretty screwed because you need more of them, maybe even just 6s, to get back to needing more 5s and 6s.  The Jihadists have endless die rolls, too, and basically create fires for the US to put out.  For all that, it's hell to learn from the condensed rulebook and huge player aids.  It also takes a lot of time to figure out what it is your opponent can do, so it's important to try both sides.  But it's not enough fun or control for all the work to learn and play.

Update:  Played a few more times, and increasing card familiarity helps.  It's still a big investment and a lot of luck, but the theme is cool.  I can't see ever raising my rating again, though.

I'm not a fan of Twilight Struggle, I am a fan of 1960, and this for me falls somewhere between the two.  You can sit down and play this one without knowing what all the cards do (maybe oil price spike or Elections), but there are a lot of moving mechanics that it will take a game or two to fully get what is going on.  I really like the History in the game.

Received my copy, and labyrinth is a nice looking game.  But it's sat on the shelf for months.  We just haven't wanted to play it.

Not sure what that means, but when a brand new game sits while 30 year old games are played ... it doesn't mean anything good.

I wish I could give this game higher than a 10. I think it is better than Twilight Struggle (another 10 for me). I enjoy the asymmetrical game play, which makes playing the Jihadists feel like a different game from playing the United States. As an added bonus, the play 2 cards per impulse system makes it much easier to PBEM than Twilight Struggle. Highly recommended.

This game is truly sublime - almost infinite replayability, and muti-layered strategy for both sides. With each side very different in their play. A big surprise for me since it was not really on my radar screen even being the huge CDG fan that I am. A truly remarkable design achievement in many ways - I'm in awe!

:tobacco: :) :D A very good and interesting game. I am gladdened by the possibility of a spike in renewed interest after the release of the expansion (which I do not have) especially since the COIN series and Twilight Struggle seemed to be squeezing this one out of space in the wargaming zeitgeist.

The inevitable comparisons to Twilight Struggle are inevitable but not particularly valuable -- some of the blame must rest with GMT's marketing folks who packaged and sold this game as TS 2.0, leading to some disappointment when it turned out to be no such thing. For my part, since I think TS is a good but hardly transcendent game whereas Labyrinth has steadily grown on me since my first play, the pointy end of this comparison will be directed differently than most peoples'.

Some bad stuff should be acknowledged; Labyrinth has a few too many clunky bits to really function as a simulation of post-9/11 geopolitics. The US's Hard v. Soft dichotomy is a cartoonish oversimplification of the strengths and weaknesses of the neoconservative and liberal-internationalist approaches to foreign relations. (To take but one example, in the "alternate history" scenario where Gore is elected instead of Bush, the prospect of invading Afghanistan in response to the Taliban's refusal to hand over Osama is ruled out from the get-go -- compare our universe's timeline in which this invasion had overwhelming bipartisan support, or for that matter the fact that the Democratic presidential candidates in 2004 and 2008 criticized US foreign policy in part on the grounds that we had not pursued military victory in, and stabilization of, Afghanistan hard enough.) Having said all this, I don't necessarily subscribe to the opinion stated by some that the game ends up being slanted towards a hard-power view of the world. Without getting very lucky with die rolls or card draws, the US in a Hard posture in this game is likely to find the all important War of Ideas action to be extremely difficult to pull off, and my experience with regime change attempts in this game basically leads to the conclusion that they are not such a swell idea unless you have a really strong plan for establishing a lasting peace and getting out quickly -- one could only wish that the Bush administration had had the same impression.

Or the fact that Islamist resistance to existing regimes is considerably more complex and multi-polar than Labyrinth's model of a single "Jihadist" enemy bent on taking over the world a la Cobra from GI Joe. Or the notion of a few straightforward propaganda and aid campaigns (the "war of ideas") transforming the states of the Middle East from oppressive regimes to responsive, modern nation-states. (If a game offers you the means to transform Saudi Arabia from a repressive theocratic autarchy to Sweden with more date palms but doesn't pause to make you wonder what forces make us put up with them as they are now, some simulation value is lost, to say the least.) And then there's the curiously minor roles played by Iran and Israel within the game, shunted aside because they don't fit the model very cleanly.

All of these things plus more (jeez, how much virtual ink do I need to expend on a simple comment) are strikes against Labyrinth [i]as a simulation[/i]. But these are sort of inherent problems when attempting to simulate a current conflict that is highly unlikely to get resolved within my daughter's lifetime, much less mine. And the grandiose strokes of major jihads vs. wars of ideas that swing countries from one pole to the other, while not accurately representing reality as we understand it, do perhaps do a decent job of representing the slightly megalomaniacal world views of the men at the top. And that conflict does make for a pretty sweet game.

Ah yes, the game.

So at the bare heart of it, Labyrinth [i]does[/i] crib one mechanical feature from Twilight Struggle -- both sides work their way through a fist full of cards with a range of pro-US, pro-Jihadist, and neutral events, each with an Operations value. On your turn, you can trigger a pro-You or neutral event OR conduct operations with the Ops value. If you play a card with a pro-Them event, you get the Ops but also have to endure the event, with events ranging from "meh" to "five-alarm holy crap." That's where the similarities pretty much come to an end. Each side is aiming for a totally asymmetrical set of goals and has a totally different set of operations to choose from. The US is focused on stopping terror attacks and improving governance in Muslim nations. The Jihadists are out to destabilize the Muslim nations and keep the US busy from its primary objective of building. Win conditions are similarly asymmetrical, and each side has a couple of paths to victory. Unlike TS, which is entirely focused on the nation-by-nation struggle for hearts and minds in one single dimension, Labyrinth gives you some playing pieces to move around as well -- the US gets some troop cubes while the Jihadist player has terror cells which can be in hiding or active, not unlike guerilla forces in the COIN games. There's some interplay that shows up when cells and troops occupy the same country but they don't really directly fight each other per se. Asymmetry also shows up in the way Ops are used. The US (as befits the slow but powerful conventional side of the conflict) uses its Ops to activate one single country, with that country's governance rating affecting how many cards can activate it. The Jihadists use their ops generally to activate individual cells, so they can be more nimble and fork the US by making them concentrate on many places at once. The downside for them is that while the US can [i]mostly[/i] do what it wants with its actions, the Jihadists usually have to chance a die roll to do anything interesting. Some people hate this aspect, but I find it more interesting than not. Control freaks are on notice.

One distinct plus of this game is that it comes with multiple scenarios and gives you a wide latitude as regards play time. You can run through the deck one, two or three times. My guess is that the two-deck game is the sweet spot, with one deck being fun for a quickie if you don't mind the fact that the order in which events come out is likely to bite you pretty hard at times. (One of many examples: there is a card where Saddam Hussein plumps Jihadist funding back up to the maximum. If this comes out early in the first scenario when funding is already at or near the max, it's a nothingburger. If it comes out later in the deck when the Jihadists are strapped for cash and the US hasn't done anything about Iraq, it's nasty.) The multiple scenarios are a nice touch. Most people seem to focus on the first one, with the board largely empty, but I imagine that the post-Iraq-invasion scenario may be a very interesting change of pace that makes a lot of cards in the game a lot more interesting.

And above all else, what Labyrinth gives you is an interesting and strong narrative that (given the mindset the game does nudge you into) keeps you engaged. It's playable and fun, and if you're in the market for this sort of experience (and why the hell have you read this far if you're not) it is worth the effort to set aside your preconceived notions about why you don't want to like it and actually play. It's definitely best with two players, but as a bonus it's the rare board game with a solo mode that's [i]almost[/i] worth getting just to play by yourself.

RATING: 10
After several games at the shorter scenario (1 deck game) I have to admit of being really impressed by this game. The subject is thorny as the game speaks about facts and people of our days, the present time. Yet the rules manage to convey a picture that's completely respectful of the different parties involved (at least to my eyes).
What's more important to me is that playing the game I've accrued some insights on what's really going on (at least in the opinion of the game designer).

The aspect that I like most is that the game is asymmetrical: the two players have a different set of rules each (that integrate in a wonderful way…!). So, even if the rules are easy to read, trying to play well is really a challenge. In defining your own strategy (and also in devising how to act/react turn by turn) the knowledge of your part of the game mechanics is not enough: you have to clearly understand what could do the other side, and it bears a completely different logic of actions.

And it turns out to be balanced. Really impressive!

When you start the game, it is hard to go in with a specific strategy.  You have to see what is going to happen first.

Tried my hand at a solo game and was having a good time.  I rolled terribly for both sides, so I think I hurt the Jihadists more.

Both Christine and Ross like this game.  It really needs to be played more.

Wonderful design, reminiscent of Twilight Struggle but with its own unique character. Labyrinth strives primarily for simulation rather than balance, so luck can, as in real life presumably, play a major role in turning the tide. The game has an ebb and flow of its own, and feels extremely tight and tense, with hard decisions all round. Overall, a super smart game that has become a favorite

+ well intertwined mechanisms, mostly making thematic sense
+ moderately complicated, but with a reasonable learning curve
+ solid components and art that does not get in the way
+ highly evocative and immersive
+ highly strategic with plausible strategy, but equally tactical in nature
+ tight and tense
+ well written rulebook and really few errata and questions

= can be quite long, with the 3-deck scenario clocking 4h+
= has quite a bit of luck of the roll and draw, which due to the theme feels right

- the jihad bot is interesting, but rather naive and with rough edges

This is a game about chaos management.  You need to deal with bad situations and make the best of it.  

There will be brutal hands and there will be great hands dealt.  

The trick is to balance the good and the bad and be able to switch tactics, if needed, as quickly and efficiently as possible.

It can be tough on either side if it falls behind but that just makes for really interesting (and very exciting) desperate plays (like jihad in fair countries or plots in good countries, etc.)

Theme is great and the game incorporates it very well.

Great game!

The rating is for 2 player game. I like the theme of the game even though it is not particularly realistic representation of the real world situation. The board and pieces are very functional (rating +1) I also like the asymmetry of the game: US and Jihadist side play very differently (rating +1). Unfortunately, the game is too random for its length. There is randomness in card draws but most importantly the key elements of the game require dice rolls, e.g. major jihad, governance rolls and especially prestige rolls (rating -2). 

I would rate the game 5 as a solo game. The AI flowcharts are quite sophisticated but in the end you can, of course, take advantage of the AI script because there is no random element to it. In fact, you have to manipulate AI or you risk losing due to "radicalization". However, the real problem with solo play is increased randomness. This is largely due to the fact that AI card play does not trigger US events and that AI can use both the effect and the operational value of neutral cards.

Labyrinth is a fun asynchronous game about a complicated topic: The Global War on Terror.  I like the notion of governance levels for countries and I like how US forces are modeled.  The cards are top-notch and are both interesting to read and look at.  After reading The Looming Tower, this game becomes even more interesting - particularly from the Terrorist's point of view.  And playing with multiple decks is the way to go with this one - a single deck is far too limited to let this game truly show its colors.

Very good feeling in this game. The two sides play very differently which makes for some interesting games. Enjoyable for non-wargamers too. It gives the feeling that you are always a few mistakes from having a huge blow dealt to you.

I finally learned how to play this one.  It has left my "for trade" list and landed a spot in my collection.  I can't wait to play it with another human...only been able to hit it solitaire thus far.  Holding my rating until I get that chance.  In the meantime, this is a game I could leave set up and play repeatedly.

edit: I've now had a chance to play with an actual opponent, and right now, this game is at the top of my list of games I want to play.

another edit: Unfortunately, I just don't have any among my group who have interest enough to commit to learning and repeated plays of this incredible game...sadness is setting in.

yet another edit: This game box stares me in the face every time I pass my game shelf.  I crumbled and committed to the expansion via GMT's P500, and so I've come full circle again.  I think it's probably going to remain in the collection even if I'm unable to get anyone to play it with me.  It's just that good.

Based on the sample games, one aborted one-deck game with two players (and a few rules wrong) and one three-deck solitaire game (with very few rules wrong). Fits in the same general complexity/time niche that Twilight Struggle does, but is a much superior game. Unfortunately, I expect that many will not play two-player because someone has to be the "enemy" in an ongoing ideological conflict. Too bad, because there's a really cool game here with great asymmetry. 

It will be interesting to see how this game is received in ten years time, much like Cold War what-if games were after the fall of the Soviet Union.

A little tweak of the Twilight Struggle mechanism: 

Here, instead of each side playing one card on each turn, two cards may be played at once, meaning that one hand can end before the other does.
Unlike TS, this game is very asymmetrical and has several winning conditions (different for both sides) and thus, the tension remains high at all times.
And really, how hard it is to manoevre international pollitics the way you want while, at the same time, one has to dismantle terrorist cells raising so close to your own yard...

Such a fun game once you get past the learning curve (which for me is pretty big). This is about the most complexity in a game I want to endure, but it has been very rewarding. The different mechanics for each side's operations are delightful. Almost a different game when playing the other side. There's so much tension as the U.S. player in trying to keep WMDs out of the hands of the terrorists and when making that crucial War of Ideas die roll. The tension for the Jihadist player is in those Plot and Jihad rolls to try to ruin a country's governance. The various events work wonderfully, and really change the game depending on who draws them and when they turn up. "Martyrdom Operation" really causes some problems for the U.S. 

Just the right amount of realism/abstract balance. Not too fiddly. 

Some notable differences in how the game "feels" compared to Twilight Struggle (which it is unfairly compared to, IMO) are as follows. In L, it is much easier to play your hand of cards in such a way as to avoid triggering opponent's events than in TS. Many of the events have prerequisites that must be met, and oftentimes, they are not. So, the card can be played safely for Ops. In TS, it feels more act/react than in L. Of course, this also occurs at times in L, such as when terrorist cells move to the U.S. and the U.S. player needs to disrupt perhaps, or when the U.S. player foils plots. But, overall I feel less of the need to immediately react to the opponent's previous play--there are no scoring cards as in TS. Finally, a couple things about the card deck. First of all, there is only one set of cards in L. There are not three separate decks that get added sequentially as in TS. Also, the deck in L is much larger. So, even though you know that all cards are in the deck from the beginning of the game, you also know that once they are played, it won't be turning up again for a long time (Oil Price Spike does allow a player to take a card from the discard, however). It also seems that there are fewer events that are 'removed' when played, so the deck stays relatively thick throughout the game. 

Rating based on 2-player game only. 

Easy to forget rules: 
--Failed major jyhad when 3 dice are rolled (i.e. 3 OPs and 3 cells) results in Besieged Regime AND shift alignment to ALLY. 
--Cadre markers removed by Jyhadist operations (Travel, Jyhad) but not by US operations (event). 
--US WoI in non-muslim countries: if resulting posture matches US posture, +1 Prestige.
--US draws cards based on Troops track, REGARDLESS of any held card.

This game perplexed me a bit - components are cool, theme looked good, but seemed a bit disjointed as if the actions I did didn't really make sense as to why I was doing them. The biggest issue with games like this (events on cards) is that you can get lost if you don't know what all the cards do.  If I don't know what may pop up later in the game for me or my opponent, it's tough to make a decision - "oh, if I had known that there was that card I wouldn't have done that." I think this is a game that needs to be played many times to get a grasp of it, but there are so many games that can be put on the table and enjoyed right from the start.

The flowchart is more of a hassle than I expected (so I can only imagine how disruptive higher play-count COIN titles are!).  There's been obvious care in the components and rule set, so I was surprised at how many ambiguities remain.

It was slightly unsettling subject matter.  Maybe too soon?

Beautiful components! (mounted map, oversized counters with rounded edges)

At times it feels like the Jihadist bot is "cheating"--e.g. he gets to use events AND ops points from a card.

I lost my first game by running out of time, which is an unsatisfying way to lose (or win).  I'm not sure I know what I would have done any differently.  I suspect the game will require some study before I improve, and ultimately I'm not sure I'm willing to put in the time. 
 Luck plays a bigger role than I would have expected.

I'm probably the only guy to play this game while actually participating in one of the simulated events--the "Regime Change" mission in Iraq.  

Interestingly enough, while playing my first game, I didn't invade Iraq...

UPDATE:  Holy shit, batman.  Chuck Norris riding on a robotic T-Rex with Jesus as his copilot into an arena full of Hooters girls while simultaneously punching Osama bin Laden in the face and giving Mr. T a high five would not be cooler than this game.

This is the best two player game I've ever played, bar none.  

It's thematic, tense, rewards both bold decision making and careful planning.  Things that happened in the real world will happen in your game, and you won't even realize what you're doing until after it happened.  Your decisions and the pressures you face will force you to act in a manner completely consistent with the actions of major world players, but yet the game itself never gets in the way or makes it feel like you had to make an action just because that's the way it happened.  

What about the rules, you say?  Well written, but really not that big a deal because the included player aids will let you play without using the rulebook.  There's a lot of interconnected things in this game, but the beauty of the game is how simple it really is to play.   

It teaches good COIN principles, even, for Chrissakes.  An actual quote from the game, for instance:  "And I was a dumbass, because I kept trying to fight your cells in the Sudan without affecting positive change--the War was never going to end."  Yup, COIN principles in a nutshell.

Go get this game--I can't say it strongly enough.

Excellent game. Tense, and well-balanced. Criticism in some quarters of neo-con agenda not well founded, IMO,  -- as US player, many rewards for pursuing a Soft policy, though for gameability it is necessary to simplify exceedingly complex effects of policy -- and its GWOT frame of reference is more valid then, say, Twilight Struggle's dominoes.

Great game. Truely two games in one box the play style per side is so different you can't go into a stand up fight with the US as the terrorist and vice versa if well played the terrorist is truly a Hydra, cut one head 5 more appear extremely demoralizing. I get the impression that longer games favor the US as less of their cards are removed after play.

(Having now played 3 partial solitaire games.)

Best GMT rulebook since Combat Commander.  NO unanswered questions came up during play -- a rare GMT bird indeed. (I did have one question after reading the rules, but it didn't affect my game.)  The basic concept is similar to TS or 1960, battling over governance quality rather than influence, but the details are quite different.  The mechanics are trickier than TS but smoother than 1960 (IIRC; it's been a while since I've played 1960).  I'm not going to bother trying to comment on its simulation value, but my initial reaction is that it's a very fun game.

Rating after 1 play. Somewhat reminiscent of [i]Twilight Struggle[/i], but more intelligent and less chaotic. Definitely a brain burner as you try to figure out your strategy.

That said, the rulebook is a bit of a bear, with some dense text and no less than a dozen exceptions scattered throughout it.

Must have game, if nothing else it will probably be interesting to look back on how we thought the conflict would evolve.

Received: 10-11-26.

I like the idea behind the game but this is way to Americo-centric to be even moderately plausible as a simulation. In this game war seems to solve all problem, which is hardly the truth as we all can plainly see in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

A smaller less specific deck would have been good as well, better to have more general events than these super specific ones.

Labyrinth is not officially going to be released until October of this year, but I was added to the group playtesting this game, much to my excitement, and while I am hesitant to discuss the mechanics for this game (for obvious reasons), playing it has done little but increase my enthusiasm. As it stands now, late in the playtest cycle, Volko Ruhnke and Joel Toppen have managed to create a game that is asymmetrical in ways that are both different and exceed every other game I have played before. This is done by making it so that the Americans and Jihadists are completely separate in what they can do with their operation points. 


While in a game like Twilight Struggle or Hannibal, the US and Soviets are basically playing with the same set of mechanical options (events, coups, realignments, placing influence in the case of Twilight Struggle; moving armies, recruiting troops, naval movement, and placing influence markers for Hannibal) in Labyrinth the two sides have both different things they do with operations points as well as different ways that they mechanically resolve. It really is quite clever, and I have to give the designer and developer major props in producing such an interesting contrast in methods that simulates the differing goals and methods of a counter-insurgency conflict so well. 

[ImageId=674264]
The game itself is fairly tense. The events are powerful enough, and the effects interesting enough, that there is a lot of potential dirty tricks and clever plays that each side can pull off. Card resolution is similar to that of Twilight Struggle in that if you play a card for operations with your opponent’s events, they occur, so you have to be careful to play them in such a way that you can mitigate their effects. In fact I would go so far as to say that the type of tension is similar to that what I feel when playing Twilight Struggle, a steady feeling of impending doom as you wait to see what nasty stuff your opponent is going to do to you, and if they are going to be able to properly capitalize on your play of their cards.

The overall balance of the game is not something that I can properly assess at this point in time, but the one two player game I played (I’ve mostly played it solo), felt like it was close right until the end, with both sides having potential ways out with some better decisions (and die rolls). One thing to be aware of is that there are more significant die rolls in Labyrinth than Twilight Struggle. While Twilight Struggle has periodic coup rolls (very important) and less frequent realignment and space race checks (less important), Labyrinth has rolls for many of the items you will attempt. The Jihadists have to roll even more dice than the Americans, but they also get to roll more dice, which mitigates this effect somewhat. 

I like Labyrinth, but my group is ambivalent enough on it, and my two player game options are rare enough that I sold it.

RATING: 4
Players play either the Jihadists, or the United States, fighting the war on terror.  Two player card driven "wargame", although it's more in the realms of Twilight Struggle than a pure wargame, in that you're extending influence.  Fairly standard "play a card and do stuff" mechanics and quite a simple game from the outside looking in, but there is a lot of nit-picky rules to work through, and both sides play quite differently, so you effectively have to learn two games.  I didn't care for this, much as I didn't care for Wilderness War - a lot of fuss 'n feathers that don't add to a good gaming experience.  Twilight Struggle works because they kept it lean and mean, even if it is a dressed up area majority Euro, while this is is a bit of a mess of mechanics and die rolls (especially for the Jihadists).  Moved on while it's "hot".

Played it once, but had a great time (well, maybe not *great*, as I was having a terrible time containing my wiley Jihadist opponent, but thrilling none the less). With it going out of print, I had to pick one up. Looking forward to getting this on the table sometime soon.

Edit: I've played the single player version of this a few times, and, aside from the self-inflicted social stigma of playing a board game by myself, had a pretty good time of it. I think I'm ready for some of the more challenging single player modes, but I'm excited to try this with other people (hopefully sometime soon).

wow. what a great game. Very tense from start to end, with some very nasty cards on both sides. Love the asymmetry in both forces and mechanics used by both sides. Love that the US doesn't need to roll for most actions but need strong enough cards (will) while the Jihadist can do stuff with any cards, but are uncertain about the results (need to roll).

This is definitively one of my favorite games.

This is a good game. I had played both Andean Abyss and Twilight Struggle going into this but still found it rather bewildering initially. Its topic is interesting. It presents the world as the Bush and Blair administrations saw it in the early 2000s era. If i take it from that perspective its a pretty good simulation. I suspect we aren't far enough from the events to make a good historical assessment of the period.

Played several games over the weekend.  If you play incorrectly it is pretty easy. :)  In the first game I made a few mistakes with both sides, but my card draw was AMAZING.  By the end, the Jihadist didn't have a cell on the board and their funding was at 1.  In the second game it was even easier, but I made critical mistakes - so it doesn't count.  In the third, I got the rules 99% correct.  It was a very hard tight game, with the US prestige down around 1-2.  Very tough draws, but a fun game.

I think that as a game, and provided you don't think too much about the game's approach to the current conflict, it's fine. It captures the asymmetric nature of the conflict in the way the US and al-Qaeda can perform actions. I like the potential of combo play with the two-card play. And in broad strokes, the game also captures the essence of the general desired outcomes of the two sides. Yes, it's more complex than Twilight Struggle but definitely a richer game.

But it carries over the incredible dicey-ness and wild swings of luck from Twilight Struggle. Major shifts in the game, like major jihad and going to good governance are down to pure luck. It makes a mockery of strategy. 

The more damning indictment is its one-sided portrayal of the conflict. Probably asking too much for a game to capture the nuances of this complex situation but this is like Dick Cheney's wet dream. 

There's all these cards which reward the US' presence in Iraq, which are worthless if there's no reason for the US to be in Iraq. But from the game designer's point of view, they're not worthless because the game practically seeks to encourage the jihadists to launch an Islamist revolution in Iraq, and thereby justifying a US invasion! If the US launch regime change in Afghanistan, it behooves the jihadists to launch another revolution and what better place than Iraq (adversary, poor governance)? I had asked the game designer how the game would simulate countries ruled by harsh dictators like Assad and Hussein (poor governance) yet deal ruthlessly and efficiently to any threat to their power. I didn't get a satisfactory answer and now I can see why. The game practically hinges on Iraq being an easy mark of jihadists, a far cry from reality.

And sure, the focus on governance is correct but it's very abstracted in the game. Spend ops, roll dice (certain event cards help) and voila! - It's like magic! It's an important part of the game and yet, the game has more detail about troop movement and disrupting cells. Also, good governance seems remarkably easy to achieve. Once the US has very high prestige (relatively easy to achieve in the early game), it has a 50% chance of getting good governance. Moreover, once adjacent countries become "good", it's easier. Wow! if only real life was that easy...

A note to future Jeff: You've tried this game four or five times now, and every time, you've asked yourself "is this fun?"

It's not. Sure, it has the potential to be, if you really want to engage with the systems frequently. But you don't like this game.

You ADMIRE this game's design, and the way it pushes you to replicate historical occurrences, and how it models the nature of the conflict. You like that it has a thesis, and one you can generally understand. 

But you wish it had drama, and tension, and pick-up and play excitement. But it doesn't. It just has a good engine to manipulate.

Disturbing theme, especially the idea that we are depicting a conflict which is mostly ideological without defined borders, no capital to seize.  A war on a word in short.

It's not as good as something like Twilight Struggle or Paths of Glory, but I still felt a nice tension in the management of my hand.  In a one deck game you're only ever going to see those events one time ever, and I'm not sure yet whether the two deck game is worth it.  I felt there were a lot of fires to put out with ops, but I also felt I couldn't afford to let some of the events go by without playing them. As you become more familiar with the deck, there's likely to be some change of posture in response to events that are now unplayable as well.  The asymmetric nature of the game was fabulous.  I could see this going either way at this point.

Oh, so all the forces of Islamic extremism are a single cohesive force, from Hezbollah to al-Qaeda to Daesh, even though in reality these groups hate each other?

Edit: After 6 months owning and playing still easy the best game I own. Solo is a thriller.

Excellent game that has a little flaw because of excessive dice rolling and the quite high factor of luck involved. But still a fascinating game that is a lot of fun, not too complicated (my first CDG AND non Euro-Game). Critisim about political bias and "accuracy" are ridiciolous IMHO, because ANY board game is. Im a student of history, and history is not "past reality" but the or a way, we perceive political developments. And labyrinth delivers a model of exactly that.

Edit: After few more plays the luck factor doesn´t seem to be as high as I thought. Sometimes it´s just stupid to make some rolls, so you can´t really be dissapointed if you do.... awesome game.

This is even better than Twilight Struggle (which is quite similar), in my opinion, and that's saying a lot (Twilight Struggle is one of the greatest board games ever). The rules were a bit intimidating for a non-wargamer such as myself, but it was worth it.

1-2 players. Excellent when played solo or with two.

I want to play this SO BAD.  I love Twilight Struggle, and would like to generally check out more card-driven wargames.

Normally I'm very sensitive to who the sides are in a game - I don't want to play as Nazis or Confederates, for example.  For some reason, I could see myself playing as either side in this game, and that doesn't make a lot of sense.

I don't get it.  A lot of my feelings depend on what happens in the cards, I guess - if I'm supposed to "win" by playing "blow up a nightclub" or "throw acid on a woman" (as Jihadist) or by playing "white phosphorous attack" or "village massacre" (as USA), then I'm probably not going to enjoy the game very much.  Still, there's an inherent tension here.

A bit of a conundrum for me.  I like the game, like most CDGs I have played, but it is really difficult for me to grasp what it is that I should DO during the game.  Most games give you some ideas of the initial goals from turn 1.  Labyrinth just feels so open to me.  It take some of the mechanics from the brilliant Twilight Struggle and finds ways to make them unique to its own game engine.  The solitaire game is a nice bonus.

After three plays I'd say this is a strong, well thought out, design. It really does give you the feel of waging an anti-terrorist campaign (but in the abstract, of course). The game is obviously based on Twilight Struggle, which itself was based on Hannibal. It has its strong points and its weak points like most games. But if you are a fan of Twilight Struggle I'd say you should love this game.  

The only downside I see right now was that the designer’s aim for compactness and efficiency may have succeeded a bit to well. Card design, for example, in a CDG is an art in itself and I've only seen it done right once (in Hannibal). This time it seems that too large a segment of your playing time is spent arguing or discussing what exactly each card means. (Was it really necessary to give players the impression that GMT was running short of verbs?) Keeping to a well written set of definitions would also have helped. 

As for the actual events themselves, well, players put in a lot of effort, maybe too much effort, seeing that they don’t trigger their opponent’s events AND they succeed! That is, between events having numerous pre-conditions and the fact that players can bury one event each turn and that players can work the early part of a turn in such a matter that the enemy events in their hand become meaningless, most enemy events you end up having to trigger accomplish little. I just find it more satisfying to spend my time making sure something does happen rather than spend my time making sure nothing happens. In my opinion, having players trigger their own events and ignore their opponent's would be more satisfying, take less time and it would allow people to concentrate on doing something with visible consequences.

Plus the board is covered with somewhat fiddly charts and boxes. Yes, having the alignment and the "grade of governance" use one chit was efficient, for example, but it also was confusing to newbies.
 
So, in the end we have a detailed, but playable, take on a modern conflict. Although its clock-work approach combined with a substantial dose of randomness is not for everyone, It is, however, a remarkable game and well worth the time you put into it.

Labyrinth is a very well-constructed game, if not a bit obscured when it comes to the rules. Not that they aren't printed out in black-and-white, but there are a lot of lookups and rulechecks while playing. This can kind of bog down the game. I think once the flow increases, this can be a well-paced experience. I like the theme and the similarities to the game play of Twilight Struggle. But there is quite a bit different to Labyrinth and I think it belongs in anyone's collection who enjoys TS but is ready for a bigger challenge and a game that demands more discovery through multiple plays. Labyrinth is not straight-forward at all, which can make it frustrating during these nascent first plays.  But I think once a couple of games have been digested, it will reveal itself more to the dedicated player.

Based on one solo play and one 2-player play.

This game is pretty fantastic.  With rules explanation and set-up, for two first timers, the game took just around 2 hours.
And within that 2 hours it had all the tension, difficult decisions, and agonizing strategy of Twilight Struggle or other great CDG's.
If the theme doesn't bother you (and it didn't bother my opponent, as long as HE played the Americans :)) then you should definitely pick this up.

Lacks the fear factor of Twilight Struggle. Also, luck runs quite high in this game -- unfortunate dice rolls can be devastating. Or just frustrating, with a player spending an entire hand's worth of cards as opps to make one 50/50 die roll. All in all, a decent wargame that's a pleasant way to spend an evening with a friend, but Labyrinth lacks the stuff that gaming memories are made of.

This is an excellent game.  The designer has done a lot with a little ruleswise.  Take something like the GWOT feeling track which is incredibly simple but very subtle in simulating the rest of the world's unhappiness with USA use of force, without some major USA diplomacy.  Many of the other mechanics work the same way to create a passably credible narrative about the conflict against Islamic extremism in addition to a tense game.  It reminds me of Twilight Struggle in that TS is conceived as the Cold War as the participants saw it---I think this game is a good attempt at constructing a "War on Terror" as US officials, defense inner circle and beltway saw it.  Turns out that it was a highly unrealistic view of the world in terms of what factually was going on, but I think this is what Washington thought was occuring.

Game mechanicwise, the 2 card combo is a really genius contribution to the genre.  The game is more complex than TS but not insanely so.  I'm starting to think I like it better than TS, but I'm still not sure.

Do be aware this game has quite a bit of dice rolling.

Update: in retrospect this game didn't have the staying power that Twilight Struggle does, I think it's the lack of paranoia at the table about what your opponent is holding/doing, so I switched their rankings.

I knew it would be great, but I didn't expect what I received. A very tense game, dripping with theme. Extremely high quality pieces and board. And really thick and sturdy box. I think it shouldn't be glossy as the theme is war/military etc., but that's just a minor detail I don't think anyone else would care about.

Had a chance to play a couple turns in a learning game. Really nothing like TS. The only shared mechanic is how cards function as Ops or events. I cannot rate this yet but will update as I play more.

Played a full game. Not really for me. I can see why some people would be really into it, but it falls flat for me. The theme is uninteresting, I don't feel much tension at all, and I found myself being very uninterested in the game.

Insane theme.
Interesting asymmetry between the two sides. It does feel like it could get a bit unbalanced as one side or the other gets the upper hand. On the whole it's easier for the USA player to get things done, both in terms of certainty and planning.
It takes quite some time for the Jihadist to repair an operation gone wrong whereas the USA player can just try and try again.
That being said, the game tells a rich and complicated story, which I really like. The subject matter is certainly boldly chosen and seems to be Bush administration variety.

Not going to rate this game after one play where we got several rules wrong. My main takeaways were not favorable, however.

CONS
-A LOT more dice-driven luck than I wanted to see.
-Card events are a bit underwhelming which may be in an effort to balance the swinginess of the dice. Many cards are conditional so they often do not trigger. 
-The game is very opaque, which is not a bad thing, but it's hard get a grounding in simple aspects of the game, like: Where am I on the board? Thematically, how is it this piece can simply travel from here to here? Why would a dice roll influence hardness or softness of this country? What are some short term goals I should be moving toward?

Decent mechanics are marred by a Neo-conservative interpretation of events on the ground. The hard and soft power stance lacks nuance, and basically the game says Al Gore would not have invaded Afghanistan in 2001. That seems wrong. Also, Saddam might ally with the terrorists through a card (okay maybe...) but there is no card representing him spurning the Islamic terrorists, which was what ACTUALLY HAPPENED!

I can't imagine a game more perfectly capturing the complexities of our age. 
Sure, the Americans have the military power to smash/reboot a country in their image. 
But with resistance fighters cropping up like weeds, and world support flagging, can the U.S. avoid being bogged down in a war they can't win?
It took me a dozen reads of the rulebook before I understood this game - and, wow. I feel like I'm fighting the war on terror when I play this game. Enough said.

I finally got to play this, it shares some of its mechanics with Twilight Struggle, but while the core mechanisms are the same, the interplay between the different elements of the game is pretty well its own beast. 

As usual with games such as these, the first game really didn't make much sense. I found some of the events very powerful and difficult to block. Some of the differences between for instance a Jihad and the Plot actions still eludes me (the latter seems the best option all around). 

As for now I really don't know if I'll go all the way down the road of getting acquainted with this game. The lack of a regular opponent is for one an obstacle.

UPDATE
This made "click" and I now understand what this is about. Ok I think the game is very interesting and tense for both sides, and seems to be modelling the ins and outs of the war on terror - from the US point of view - pretty well. As for now I think it is more fun to play than Twilight Struggle.

UPDATE
Played the jihadis this evening and won my first game after establishing the fourth islamic state in Indonesia. Now I think the jihadis fun is dependent upon the ability of the US player to threaten the operations of the cells and its capacity to make the jihadis feel hunted down. Therefore in these first games where we don't really know what we're doing I found playing the US more entertaining.

Played again as the US and finally got the first US victory! I think I "get" this game and its moving parts. For now I prefer it to Twilight Struggle, but somehow the latter has more of a global feeling to it, while events in Labyrith feel crammed in short space of time, in the confusion of the present contemporary world.

Volko's proto-classic. It's just one of those games that rewards multiple plays. Lies somewhere in between Twilight Struggle and the COIN series. Relies on TS-style card play (but factions each get two plays in a row), but the movement of cells/influence on the board is more akin to the COIN dynamic.

Does a great job combining the thematic nature of the War on Terror as a muddy, miring conflict without firm resolution with the game mechanics.

Interesting take on recent history, informative.  Returned to the original design recently and find it kinda dated.  For one, the mechanics sometimes force a player to do perverse things that would be perverse in real life.

Example: after facing a blowout of prestige due to some bad rolls on regime changes, the US tried to recover by setting posture, although 2/3 chance of failure (soft).  West tilted heavily soft, so I had to reassess US to soft (as Jihadis mushrooming) with multiple Islamic states popping up.  Seems that Islamic success would tilt west to hard posture.

Solo play: good implementation of the card-driven system, that offers some very interesting decisions. But the rules could be much clearer at some points (travel!), and some turns lack a bit of elegance and simplicity.

RATING: 7
A solid and interesting game, but the amount of dice rolls lower my score a bit. You roll for most activities, which inserts way too much random elements into what is otherwise a very tight set of rules.

Mechanically it points forward from Twilight Struggle towards COIN; the card and alignment shifting system is very much TS, while the euro-style meeples and flippable terrorist pieces add an extra level of area control strategy.

Thematically it's obviously a bit controversial. Personally I find present-day subject matter very interesting in a game, but I guess some people will be repulsed by it. I think approaching Labyrinth from a political angle is a mistake though, as it's obviously not aiming for a detailed simulation of the war on terror bur rather for an abstract model of the general principles behind it.

UPDATE: lowered my score to 7 after a session where the game's general randomness produced almost ludicrous results. Way too much is decided by chance; a row of poor hands and some bad dice rolls can send you plummeting into a hole very fast, and getting out again is nigh impossible unless you get a row of great hands and some super dice rolls. 

I understand that the randomness is meant to reflect the unpredictability and lack of control that both the U.S. and the terrorists face, but resorting to massive dice rolling is not optimal from a game design point of view. I'm glad that Mr. Ruhnke left most of the dice out of the COIN system and created a more dynamic card mechanic instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I had high hopes, but in hindsight they were based on the (widespread) irrational assumption regarding Labyrinth's expected similarity to Twilight Struggle.
TS is fundamentally clean, this is obtuse; TS is tense, this is frustrating; TS makes you cherish every OP, in this they go to waste; TS lets you compensate for bad draws, this is fixated on getting 3 OPs; TS lets different players pursue different agendas, this is a see-saw; TS had interesting events, most of these events are loaded with ridiculous preconditions.
Even on its own merits, Labyrinth is not so hot, even on a 1-deck game. Too long, too unfocused. It reminds me a lot of Wilderness War insofar as they share some of the same flaws.

I gave this one a try. I made two good attempts and this game has quite a steep learning curve. The rules aren't overly complex, but putting the pieces together to form a cohesive strategy takes some effort... then you have to learn a huge stack of cards. This game is significantly harder to get into than Twilight Struggle, and with all the games I have, I don't have the desire. I will just play TS. It is a well designed game, and it is immediately apparent that it is very deep. I like games like that, but I'm not interested in the subject matter... too new. I'm hoping Cuba Libre gives me the depth of this game in an easier to grok platform that has the option of solo or multiplayer.

Preliminary rating after my first game with the final rules.

Also played two playest games several months ago.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

UPDATE: After eight plays, the game is starting to show its flaws as a simulation of real world policies and events.

Governance can be way too easily manipulated by both sides without too much hassle. In fact, the game narrative seems to fit more Bush's and Bin Laden's wildest dreams than anything else. It's not by coincidence that local politics in both muslim and non-muslim countries are utterly underrepresented. 

All in all the game is just a b&w reflection of an unrealistic bipolar world with no middle grounds between the extremes.

On a more positive note, Labyrinth is always fun and tense, although lucky/unlucky rolls can and will have a significant impact in many games.

UPDATE 2: I still think this game is a dreadful simulation. But it certainly plays fast, furious and offers plenty of tactical options to both sides.

My first P500 game. Somewhere in complexity between Twilight Struggle and Paths of Glory. The solitaire flowchart is easy to grasp and provides a good amount of challenge.

UPDATE: Played this game again a few days ago and it's interesting to see how the world reacted to the terrorist threat only a few years ago and how things have changed. There is a sense of real paranoia in the game through the event cards that makes e travel back to post 911 and realize how much we as a society have calmed down since.

I was very curious to see how this topic was handled in game.  As it turns out the answer is not very well mechanically or thematically. Randomness is not a bad thing in a war game, but one die roll shouldn't change ones win probability by 40+%.  The game also feels overly asymetric to the point that my opponent's actions rarely affected my own.  

The thematic problem is one of motivation.  Al Qaeda's ultimate goal was not to damage the U.S, as it is here.  I'd be more forgiving on this front if the game played well though, as making an Al Qaeda goal realistic and attainable is a tricky combination.

Terribly disappointing.  I played the jihadists, admittedly had no idea what I was doing (until near the end), often found myself scratching my head as to what to do next with my ops, was completely outplayed, yet I won.  My opponent had terrible dice rolls in too many crucial situations.  There is no cause or effect as to why prestige can drop from 1 to 6 on a single dice roll.  So many critical operations come down to a single dice roll.  Someone can get bogged down in one region for many turns if they get crap dice.  No hand managament as you must play every card, no discards, and the deck is too large to even worry about events coming back.  Gameplay is so monotonous I can't imagine ever playing more than a one deck game.  The assymetrical game play makes it feel like you are playing solitaire while you throw an occasional monkey wrentch into your opponents own solitaire.  This game is so much more fiddly than TS yet seemed very dry.  Yuck!  I'll give it one more try but I'm really disappointed...

Near perfection.  It's so good I don't know what could be done to make it better.  So why isn't it a 10?  I find that the game typically revolves around Afghanistan and Pakistan.  I realize that you can't fault it for this because that fits perfectly with the theme.  In fact it should probably be applauded for capturing this theme so well.  It just gets repetitive after playing half a dozen games.  The scenarios that come with the game go a long way to squash this repetition.  The rulebook is superb.

We're enjoying this at the moment.  It's been all Jihadist wins so far so we've clearly got some learning to do ... & maybe the consistently bad US dice rolling didn't help.

Played a few more times & the US managed to get a win thanks mostly to decent card draws & good play.

I think this game has a bit more luck (in card draw & dice rolls) than I prefer but it's still a pretty good ride.

Update: I'm liking the game even more now (partly due to the randomness) & have become good at winning with the US.

A clever abstraction of George Bush's War on Terror with so many moving parts that it takes 2-3 games just to learn the rules, this really is a big step up in complexity from Twilight Struggle. For all that it's still a single draw deck CDG with a massive emphasis on die rolling, so there's still a considerable and swingy amount of luck. Themewise, this is quite possibly the blackest wargame I've ever played, the continuing relevance means it's not one for light hearted banter. Not an easy game for either side to make real progress in, but I'd say the Jihadist is modestly advantaged in the one deck game provided he can force the US to Soft Posture for some of the time at least. A US who manages to remain at Hard throughout can Regime Change pretty much at will and as RC is an instant loss of Islamist points, the Jihadi will have a tough time of it. After some initial scepticism this has become one of my favourite CDGs. It competently models a fight against an intractable foe across a world you cannot control, so it's as frustrating as it is fascinating, but even a blow out loss leaves you wanting to play again and that's always a good sign for me.

This is no TS killer, but it is still a solid game. I think the game will bear significant repeat playing, the mechanics are reasonably innovative and the game tension interesting. It just feels a little looser than I would like and the dice side of things is annoying (I say this as some one who doesn't mind dice), but rolling for everything can at times feel important, still this maybe my heart talking not my head, so I will try and play more and see what I think. Great asymmetry, I still feel a more nuanced perspective on the War on Terror would have been nice as well.

Wow, what an impressive game.  I can't help comparing it to Twilight Struggle, so I won't - I think I might actually like Labyrinth more, even though I think TS is a superior game design.  Labyrinth takes a step down from TS in terms of geopolitical abstraction and a corresponding step up in terms of rules complexity; as a result, Labyrinth provides a much richer cat-and-mouse struggle as the US tries to assert itself in the Muslim world while trying to keep the Jihadists at bay as the Jihadists look for opportunities to exploit and punch holes in the US armor.  Since the game-winning conditions of Labyrinth are not tied to VPs or random scoring elements a la Twilight Struggle, it is easier to plan and execute a long term strategy (though the increased randomness introduced by the dice rolls keep things from being TOO easy).  The end result is a richly narrative game that doesn't feel at all scripted - an especially impressive feat when you read through the forums and realize that the designer deliberately designed the game to encompass a plethora of possible alternate historical scenarios while still grounding it in (more or less) reality.  The thought put into the design is simply staggering.

UPDATE: Further plays have only cemented my love of this game, so much so that I find myself downgrading Twilight Struggle.  I would pretty much always rather play Labyrinth - it's just that good, especially once both players are familiar with the rules and the game really flows.

The first time I played this I found it to be boring and clunky.  With subsequent plays, I stated seeing the nuances of the game's mechanics, and it all began to click.

If you go into this with the 'This is a sequel to Twilight Struggle" mentality, you will be disappointed.  This game bears almost no resemblance to its distant cousin.  The feel is completely different.  It is like trying to compare Agricola to Through the Ages.  Both are great games, but don't think that they will have a similar gaming experience.

Very, very neat game. Reminiscent of its forebears, Wilderness War and Twilight Struggle, but still unique and fun to play. The solo variant is now a bit dated, I suppose, but that doesn't stop me from having a lot of fun with it! It's a real blast to play!

RATING: 9
After 10+ plays I must say it's a BRILLIANT game.

Mechanically very different from Twilight Struggle.  More complex rules too.  But the overall feeling from playing is quite similar to the TS experience...
And that's GOOD.
Because - despite the dice - which can really hurt both sides (much more than in TS), the game is just FUN.  Exactly like TS is.

EDIT: Replayability is GREAT.  Every game is different and has its own focal points.

EDIT2: ALL '1's given to this game are based on the political ground.  That only proves that the design itself is fabulous and if someone does not agree with the political perspective of the designer, one should not play the game and - above all - should not judge it!!  Otherwise, it's a JERK behaviour.

EDIT3: After 20+ plays I'm starting to sense repetitiveness and - paradoxally - luck starts to bother me...

Playtested.  Great game!  Has all the challenges of Twilight Struggle, but asymmetrical, and enough new gameplay and mechanics to feel fresh.  The theme and tension really resonates.  I could see some folks getting irked by luck of the dice (this has many more important dice rolls than Twilight Struggle), but half the game is working around bad luck/rolls and events you cannot prevent.  I think it tends to even out, based on sheer volume of rolls.

I preordered the game as soon as I heard that it was announced.  The things that I like about Labyrinth:
[1] Asymmetrical play – both players have different options and have to focus on different things in order to win
[2] A very complex, well done solitaire set of rules
[3] The setting – war on terror is not a thing you see a lot in games

EDIT: I increased my rating from 8 to 9. This game has a tremendous depth!

An extremely intriguing game and a wonderfully mature design. I definitely need to play more to know how deeply I really love it (or not) but one thing is sure, this is really an impressive game on every aspect.

After some years of playing it (not as often as I wished!), I realize that the card play is not as interesting as Twilight Struggle, and that the randomness of the dice sometimes have a HUGE impact on the result of the game. I now rate it a 7.

So far, it's pretty impressive.  Obviously, it compares to Twilight Struggle but Twilight Struggle is a pretty tight game with more euro influence.  Labyrinth is alot more determined by isolated dice rolls.  The narrative is alot more interesting in L:WoT but a random High/Low Prestige Roll or something can really imbalance the game going forward.  There are alot of dice rolled, so it should balance but some rolls are more important than others and the dice has alot of impact on the game.  The theme is well done and the production is top-notch.  I really like it but I'm not sure it's a masterpiece.

I got this for a Christmas Gift in 2011. I was hoping for more of a Twilight Struggle game. These rules were very difficult for me to remember all the time so I am now just concentrating on using the players aid card as my "rules". I am starting to understand the game a bit better, and I am enjoying it more now too, so I raised my rating from a 5 to 8.

What a unique game! It is a highly unpredictable game that relies on lots of dice rolls. The theme is intriguing, the game mechanics is smooth and challenging, bits and board quality is top notch, and the value of gaming experience is high. It is my new obsession in playing board games and it will take a while before i can focus on my other favorite games. It is not a game for people who dislikes lots of dice roll and prefer more control. Also it is not for those light gamer and definitely not for those who dislike to play as the terrorist. But if you purely look at it in game's perspective, it is an outstanding creation that gives you an unforgettable and exciting gaming experience.

This game has it all:
- A provocative subject put across with a definite (albeit conventional) point-of-view.
- Simple mechanics, well presented in clean rules and superb play aids.
- Quality components, including an understated but lovely board.
- Tense gameplay with apparently endless layers of strategy.
On top of that: 13 plays in just over 3 weeks? What more can I say? Oh yes... Fabulous! :D

Qualitatively this is a [b]10[/b], no doubt about it. I have other CDGs I'd like to get into though, so there's always the chance that a game of [i]Labyrinth[/i] wouldn't be at the top of my list on given session at the gaming table. ;)

RATING: 6
Not sold on the game yet. Many paths to victory and different strategy options for each side are pluses, but the US is hampered by needing high ops for so many options, and the Jihadist player has less choices it seems, and therefore feels a bit repetitive. Also, the dice rolling can be a big frustration. Spending a 3 op card for a 50/50 dice roll in place of an event doesn't feel right, and yet you are forced to do that to hopefully advance your cause.

Honestly, there is enough meat to this game that I haven't connected all of the dots after two plays, so some of my hesitations might disappear after more plays, but for now I don't plan on purchasing. I will play if someone breaks out their copy again though.

Interesting and fun mechanics, but I should play it more times. I was afraid that it was full of American propaganda but it is not so terrible. Anyway some aspects are amazing: disrupt with US troops increase US prestige (I think it is not real), and hard US can invade countries under islamic rules only (in the reality Iraq was invaded, a laic regime), excepting Iran, the most important country under an islamic regime: this is hidden in the game as an "special country". At last, there are cards for the former European presidents Blair, Chirac and Schroeder, but not Aznar, this is a very important omission that I hope to be repared in a new edition.

I don't understand how a game can be this complex, to the point that the first play is annoyingly painful to get through, and have so many dice rolls... The whole idea of using dice rolls is to SIMPLIFY game play, provide an abstraction for events occurring in the game. If you have dice, the game should have simpler rules...

This is a poor design compared to Twilight Struggle, they took the worst part of TS (dice) and amplified it...

I'm willing to give it another chance since I didn't quite understand all the rules

RATING: 8
Great -- can't wait to find an opponent. Scenarios really excite the imagination, especially the "Call Me Al" alternative history scenario.

Very solo-friendly but you'll probably need to play with the more difficult solo options or override the Jihadist flowchart in order to create a true challenge.

Board construction is okay but you'll want to baby it/reinforce the backing with some gaffer's tape. I handle mine with care and it already delaminated a bit along the load-bearing center crease.

Labyrinth is a design that can't see the forest for the trees. 

When you get down to the details, there are some good ideas here. Muslim states swing along two separate axes, one for government stability (good-fair-poor) and one for allegiance (allied-neutral-adversary), with "Islamic State" being a kind of rock-bottom combination of Poor and Adversary that requires a revolution to institute and a regime change to unseat. Both sides have a variable hand-size that, for the US, depends on troop intensity (less cards with more troops deployed) and, for the fundamentalists, depends on funding. The US also has a prestige track that can give them bonuses to "war for ideas" actions (essentially non-military operations to sway a country). Fundamentalist pressure on US Prestige is the corollary to US pressure on fundamentalist funding. 

The country-level mechanics have potential, as do the pressures that come along with the prestige/troop intensity/funding tug-of-wars. Unfortunately those particulars are integrated into a design with some pretty obvious failings at the birds-eye level. The lack of a tiered deck is a significant drawback. Deck management is AWOL, and the sense of maneuvering against your opponent's hand is greatly diluted. Event-play itself is merely passable - more robust than 1960, but a far cry from Twilight Struggle.  The game also doesn't scale victory conditions with scenario length, which is questionable since the US begins in disarray and pushes hard toward a tipping point. Time is clearly on their side, and yet players can opt for 1, 2, or 3 (!) times through the deck with no change in victory conditions. 

Even setting that aside, I can't see why you'd ever play a campaign scenario - after 3 times through a 110 card deck (admittedly with some event pruning), the game would have overstayed it's welcome by at least an hour, probably 2. Indeed, one-time through the deck comes close to exhausting the decision points offered by the game. Tactics are flat the whole way through. The fundamentalist player is going to roll a lot of dice, and even though the risk management is reasonable, the stakes are still higher than they ought to be because the act of rolling accomplishes no secondary objective. Compare with Twilight Struggle, in which a failed coup still drops Defcon. Here, failed plots have the opposite effect, leaving the fundamentalists more vulnerable (revealed cells), not less. This kind of thing is par for the course in Labyrinth. The game takes one step forward and two steps back for Card-Driven design. It contains impressive flourishes yet exhibits no awareness of the big picture. 

CDG aficionados will find a passing diversion here, but Labyrinth is clumsy where it counts.

My big question is if I need Labyrinth. I don't often play longer two-player games and when I do I have plenty of choices ranging from Hannibal and Combat Commander via Twilight Struggle to Commands & Colors. Labyrinth specifically has to compete with Twilight Struggle for table time. After one play it loses this comparison on multiple angles: relation of rules overhead vs. depth, fiddlyness, randomness due to high stake low probability rolls, accessability, less interesting card management. On the plus side, every move is dripping with theme as you recognize many facts you've learned about directly and not just in history classes. I just wished the game would show some more reflection on the war on terror beyond the US position. 
Notwithstanding all my issues, Labyrinth nonetheless is a good game. But the better (in this case Twilight Struggle) is the biggest foe of the good.

Update (12/28/10): Need to replace those cursed dice. Won as the US player; saw the extremes again, with the US maxing out Prestige and the Jihadists bottoming out on funding. Rating at a 6 and probably will stay there.

--

Update (12/7/10): After getting punched in the stones by the dice again as the jihadist player, where I literally rolled one or two successes in the whole game and the US player missed once, I'm disinclined to play again. It's probably a "bad player" more than a "bad game" problem, but I suck at all kinds of games, and seldom has one left me quite as despairing as this one.

--

Labyrinth trades Twilight Struggle's relative ease of play for a much higher mechanical load, and replaces TS' nearly mirror-image forces with genuine asymmetry that makes playing either the US or the jihadists vastly different playing experiences. Gameplay mechanics are easy enough to understand individually and have a good theme-to-procedure connection, but their interaction is fairly complex, and new players will (I suspect) often be finding themselves wondering which levers to pull to do what.

Theme and mechanics blend very well: The US can do pretty much anything it wants but only one thing in one place at a time and must be always wary of terrorist plots. The jihadists have somewhat more flexibility but have to roll dice to partially or fully complete most operations, and while the reward is often higher for pulling off operations in "good" governance countries, the chance of success is quite a bit slimmer. Bad die rolls can be punishingly bad, and while there's a rationale for it (e.g., uncertain allies, cells exposed), it doesn't mean that it's necessarily fun to be on the shaft end of it. There are definitely some nice touches, though, including how the US player is punished for being out-of-step with world opinion via hard/soft posture misalignment penalties.

The rulebook is slim, but the economy is achieved partly by pushing charts to the player aids and the "big picture" stuff to the (excellent) Playbook. The rules themselves are a little funky--clearly enough written (I had few questions in my first two-player game) and fairly efficiently organized, but telegraphic with (I feel, anyway) more than the normal proportion of rules stuffed into the components section and relatively little meat in the rest. Ultimately, the rules are reliant to an unusual degree for a GMT game on the Playbook for (again, excellent) examples of play and discussion of how the mechanics fit together. The player aids are wonderful and almost obviate the need for the rulebook's discussion of operations; the absence of Plot resolution information is the only noticeable flaw.

Art, production, and component wise, Labyrinth is at least as good as Twilight Struggle--probably better, in fact, because much more information is crammed onto the board in the form of tracks, event boxes, and reminders. The achievement is even more impressive because TS is in its third printing. The dice that match the player pawn colors and the cell cylinders that have the green crescents screened on them are small but sweet additions.

Right now, I have two main reservations. The cards are often complex and highly conditional. This makes processing them at the table a bit of a challenge--one that should decrease over time--but it may well limit the agony of triggering an opponent's event. I would put the stress level of triggering opponent's events closer the 1960 than the TS end of the spectrum: there are some hard decisions but seemingly more ways to either bury or obviate the event than is true in TS. My other concern is that the game, well, may not end up being that fun. It's clever and well designed but may be too "procedural" to be a home run. We'll see. I definitely want to give it another go, and soon, and also give the solo version a try.

 Initially rated an 8 based on potential prior to actually playing. After a couple months I can say I seem to be beset with analysis paralysis as I try to play through it. For some reason the rules have not sunk in, and am constantly going back to the rules, taking forever, and getting frustrated. I think I'm mostly frustrated at myself, but I'm afraid it will rub off on the game and I'll put it away and miss out on a great experience. Maybe I just need to dive in and not sweat "getting it right" so much. It's probably better to get the flow of the game and accept that the first few times through I won't get all the rules right.

This game left me wondering "Why should I care?"  I got it to play solo, and that's what I base my opinion on.  It has a stark, procedural feel to it, with the repetitive pushing of markers back and forth on a series of tracks, or moving a couple of jihadists in or out of a country.  Even successful plots seem totally bloodless, without evoking any feeling one way or another for the victims (none are ever seen or even identified) or the plotters.  Sure, there's card management, but that only occupies so much interest.  I never felt on the edge of my seat at any time. Just not my type of game, I guess.

I've never been a big fan of the theme. It's a little too sensitive for my taste.

But the gameplay is very intriguing so I've ended up coming back to it until I bought a copy for myself.

The high number of die rolls should level the randomness out over the course of the game. However, if that does NOT happen and you just end up rolling badly for the entire game, it can be very frustrating and annoying to play as the jihadists.

I can't help feeling like this is a considerable refinement on Twilight Struggle. Playing two cards in a row allows for more sophisticated hand management (esp on the US's part since they can hang onto a card each turn). The game definitely punishes imperial overreach. I won my first game against an old hand by relentlessly focusing on Pakistan, then Egypt and Libya. He admittedly rolled really poorly, and at some points I found myself thinking, is this all there is? But the wide range of possible tactics and the more open feel make this a winner for me. I opted to look at some of the flavortext as sarcastic snark (anyone who doesn't think al jazeera is a resource worth taking seriously isn't paying the kind of attention I'd like).

(Rating based on several plays)

This game is wrongly consider the sister of Twilight Struggle. The only thing that these two games have in common is card playing mechanic, i.e. triggering events when playing opponent's card for operations. Everything else is completely different. The most distinguishing factor is probably the asymmetric game play. 

Lack of scripting - i.e. not dividing deck into different periods - takes a lot of planning and complexity out of the game, which is bad in my opinion. There's lots of events with preconditions that are seldom met, so it is often safe to play opponent's cards. The game seems a bit chaotic and not as tense as TS. It has much more dice throwing, especially for the Jihadists. I am yet to discover strategies in Labyrinth and I hope the rating will go up.

Incredibly solid box; top-end game board; good interior presentation; a solid playbook a la Wilderness War to accompany the rules; and rules and playbook with color illustrations.  I just hope the cards hold up to repeated play.

Another card driven war game, like Twilight Struggle from GMT.  It's quite asymmetrical with different operations available to each player, different winning conditions and different game mechanics.

The theme is quite interesting and with it being based on current events it's politically charged.  Details for each event on each card are provided in a supplemental book and it's fun to read the flair for each card while playing.

The game mechanics are more complex than Twilight Struggle and requires a time commitment to learn all of the rules.  Single play is available to learn the game on one's own but the decision tree for the 'AI' player adds more to learn on top of the rules.  Definitely play through the given scenarios.

Once the rules are learned the tactics and strategies take more time.  There are multiple victory conditions and the conditions are different for each side.  It's difficult for an early player to keep track of the status of both players and a sudden win can occur.

Because each side has different operation choices there is quite a bit to learn for both players:  you need to know what choices you have and what choices your opponent has.

The game designer compares the game to Twilight Struggle and my own comparison can be summed up as:  a more complex version of Twilight Struggle.  If you like complexity you'll enjoy the game.  It's about 3x as complex.

The game duration can be much shorter because you decide how many times the deck will be reshuffled.  You can play either a 1, 2 or 3 deck game with a 1 deck game playing out in 1-2 hours.  The game is also faster to set up than Twilight Struggle meaning you can play through it quicker with a more predictable game duration.

I'm not rating it as high as Twilight Struggle because of the increased complexity leads to more random play because it's just too difficult for some people to keep track of everything, especially new players.

As a Volko Ruhnke design, this game skews chaotic.  The game narrative often runs in wildly unlikely and highly improbable ways.  Folks who are looking for a realistic simulation of the US effort to combat terrorism and Islamist extremism will be disappointed.  However, the game does capture the feel of the conflict and the challenges faced by the opposing parties.  The cards themselves are educational and the game plays with a great deal of tension and suspense.  After five plays, I'm still learning and really enjoying this one.

Trying to abstract all the subleties of this complex subject material was always going to be a challenge, so I'm willing to give its slightly one-eyed US-centric view of the world the benefit of the doubt. Where it scores is in the tension of the plots and the dynamic fluctuating situation. It doesn't feel quite as scripted as TS, but is possibly a bit too random.

This is an intriguing political/military game in the vein of Twilight struggle.  My limited experience suggests it might not be quite as rich as its illustrious forebear but that's no shame.  It has some unique mechanics of its own and it models its own conflict with a nice balance of detail and abstraction.

Commentaires après 23 parties :
J'en veux encore !!!

Je ne peux pas m’empêcher d'y aller de ma petite comparaison avec Twilight Struggle (excellent au demeurant !) :
je trouve Labyrinth plus vivant, plus dynamique et plus assymétrique encore.

Le jeu est très immersif. Le thème est complètement en phase avec la façon de jouer de chaque camp.
L'interaction est maximale : on doit forcément jouer en fonction des initiatives de l'adversaire.
Ce n'est pas du tout un jeu où chacun joue dans son coin. Si vous le faite, c'est le meilleur moyen de vous ramasser une bombe nucléaire en pleine face par exemple ;)

Vraiment une merveille ce jeu.

Petit tips : pour initier les joueurs je leur fait jouer les terroristes et je ne les embête pas avec toutes les règles du camp américains.
Du coup c'est plus digeste pour eux et dans tous les cas il leur faudra au moins une partie complète pour devenir un brin efficace.
Difficile de faire autrement la première partie leur servira forcément de partie d'initiation et ils tomberont dans le jeu au bout de quelques tours... et souvent reviendront le lendemain pour "en refaire une en jouant autrement" ;)

ps : durée d'une partie 2h30 (un peu plus pour la première car il faudra inévitablement faire des rappels de règles car elles peuvent difficilement s'assimiler avec les seules explications en début de partie)

With a couple of plays under the belt, I really like it, even though it is a much more complex game than its cousin, TS. Over all I think I prefer TS, but it is too early to tell. a 3-deck game will turn very long indeed.

In my experience keeping out of regime changes is the way forward for the US - but then again, the Jihadists didn't pressure me on that count by not choosing major jidhads.

End of the second game saw 2 WMD plots in the US foiled with the last two cards I had on hand :)

As a game, it is great. As a model of the real life War on Terror I'm more sceptical
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Not so bad in terms of gameplay, though its rules are written fairly badly, making some elements impossible to understand without some experimenting, but what really got to me was that this is one of the only games that I feel immoral playing. Launching suicide bombers to kill innocent civilians or using torture make my stomach turn in a way that I haven't felt before. The cards even use newspeak euphemisms like 'Enhanced Interrogations' and 'Renditions' to disguise the true enormity of the cards' real effects. The game's normalization of horrific violence makes me unwilling to play this again. 

Not only this, but it is complicit in the acceptance of the absurd fear of 'radical Islamic terror' taking over the world, even being able to launch WMD attacks in the US. Also, the game accepts the patently false rationales for regime changes in various Mid East countries. This is a game not worthy of play by anyone with any moral feeling in him.

Eh... I really like the concept of this game, but I think I make it more complicated than it is.

I am very interested in the theme of this game but the actual gameplay left me wanting for a lot more. Everything of importance is up to a die roll and about the best chance you can hope for is 50/50. Most of the time you're hoping for a 1 in 6 chance if the desired result isn't impossible altogether. In the end it works but entire turns seem to be excersizes in futility.

The board is in good quality.

I have played Labyrinth 10 times, but haven't tried the newest scenario from C3i magazine yet. The game is heavy themed. The objectives and mechanism of 2 sides are totally different. The only complaint from Eric is the choice for the terrorists is limited on possibilities. Just like gambling. The game could be played solo with terrorist AI. I have tried it twice. That's okay with different levels of difficulties.

Production quality is top notch. Game play for both sides is asymmetric and very interesting to play. Playing through a game, seeing the events and story arc unfold, can create an amusing "what if" version of history. A complaint I have is playing as the US. Critical 'War of Ideas' die rolls are frequent, and devastating if failed too often. This is very similar to failed coup attempts in Twilight Struggle, except that the US needs to do 'War of Ideas' actions more often than coups happen in Twilight.

This game is well made, solid, and has high replayability.  The only reason the game is not a higher ranking is the subject.  Terrorism is a difficult theme.  I really want to play the game two players, but it is not easy to find anyone who is willing to play as the enemy of the US.

RATING: 8
Asymmetrical gameplay makes it very different depending on whether you are playing the US or Jihadist side. Despite this asymmetry, the game feels very well balanced. 

It's a lot of fun, but expect a learning curve -- not for the rules, but for figuring out what the hell you ought to be doing. This was not at all apparent to me during my first play or two. This one grew on me: I was lukewarm at first, but it's now a favorite.

An excellent game in the same vein as Twilight Struggle whose mechanics really fit the theme of the Global War on Terror.  Both sides play differently and have different actions available to them, reflecting their different goals and capabilities.  Additionally, the powers of the two sides are asymmetrical, with the US having the capability to drop in troops en mass to overthrow a radical regime, while Radical Islamists have the ability to wage terror plots and stretch the US' resources.  It also comes with a solo mode, but unfortunately you can only play as the US.

RATING: 7
Solitaire: This is a superb solitaire game, albeit a long one. My first play took me an hour to set up and three hours to play. I won, partly because the AI couldn't roll successes to save its life. I know I made at least a few mistakes, and I probably made some others that I didn't notice.

I was hoping Labyrinth would be tense, engaging, and historically interesting, and it is. It has all of those things in common with Twilight Struggle, although they differ in many other ways. Both are among the most complex games I've played, and both also have in common that things speed up as play progresses. The rulebook is great, and repetition and ease of reference meant that the back half of my first play took a lot less time than the first half.

Teaching this to myself was fun because, while daunting, I didn't have to worry about explaining how both sides worked to another person. I think that would make teaching Labyrinth challenging, at least until I've played it a couple more times.

The design is brilliant throughout. Every time the game is doing something mechanically, it's also doing it thematically; every action, every decision, every element makes sense. It has a point of view, clearly disclosed throughout, and is respectful of its subject matter.

I also love that it offers so many possibilities. Even with a one-deck game, how things come out, how die rolls fall, and myriad other decision and break points change everything that comes afterwards. And it's flexible: I won my first play without ever deploying or even moving troops, all by pushing the "war of ideas."

Due to its length, I don't see myself breaking this out solo as often as I might otherwise like. I can play a game of each of my solo mainstays in the time it takes to play one game of Labyrinth, or at least the time it will take until I get faster at it. But when I do break it out, I know I'm in for a treat.

Looking at Labyrinth objectively, my opportunities to play it are slim. Re-rated from an 8 to a 7 and sold.

4 / 5 - Great.

This is a bold and highly innovative design that deserves kudos alone for daring to be a game that's going to cause genuine political and moral debate. Game-wise it's also very good: it's got that CDG addiction quality and an almost overwhelming number of very tightly integrated mechanisms that you need to balance: so many that it actually makes the game rules and play hard to make sense of at all. So there's plenty of definite strategy but I'm not sure yet how big the luck factor is: you roll a lot of dice but some rolls are much more important than others. More plays will tease that out. Biggest complaint otherwise is too many event cards with complex pre-requisites which will never go off, wasting combos and making hand management a bit too easy.

After two plays (both as Jihadist) I don't like this game.  I'm a wargamer so I can handle randomness as an essential part of simulation.  But rolling the die for every single card play is an exercise in frustration.  Also I didn't really feel engaged or a strong sense of narrative.  I've never been that interested in modern or unconventional warfare so maybe that doesn't help as a matter of personal taste.  But this wasn't fun.  And I think the underlying assumptions about the War of Ideas are questionable.

I had avoided playing Labyrinth for quite some time because that war just makes me angry.  The game, I am happy to say, did not make me angry in any political way, and it didn't have the overwhelming (thematic) pro-American bias I was expecting.  The treatment of the topic is balanced and non-offensive no matter which side you're on.

Shame on me for letting my expectations get in the way of a good game, because this was lots of fun.  I look forward to playing it again.

Have only played a couple of solitaire games (and thanks for the solitaire rules!), but this is a pretty clever game. While the Twilight Struggle influence is clear, this is a different game -- asymetrical sides, and I would say a good but more fiddly sequence of play. Players are going to spend a lot of time checking charts and rules until they are very familiar with play. There is still the cat and mouse card/ operation play as in TS, there is just more complexity here -- a good or bad thing, depending on your taste. The subject matter is also perhaps less appealing than TS. (TS subject matter seems more like history, this seems more like ongoing events)

For wargamers, the rules won't be a problem. For more casual gamers, who found TS to be around their limit of complexity of rules, this one may be a little bit more than they want to handle.

GMT, maker of games that sound and look AWESOME to me and which I have a penchant for purchasing readily without sufficient evidence or research, unlike most other games I purchase.  Twilight Struggle being my favorite game of all time, and from them, I saw they had a War on Terror game and was immediately smitten - and bought this.

This game made it to table once, and immediately struck me as being similar to Twilight Struggle - a global card-driven war game par excellence.  But the very different method of contesting areas, especially being different between the terrorists and the Americans, was not awe-inspiring.  Quite the opposite, diving into the rules and playing through was simply too, I don't know, constrained.  I understand limited resources and having to carefully choose where to attack or defend - and yet, I also simply felt hemmed in by the scale of the game as it played out smaller than it looked.  I believe I played this with Richard, who wasn't a huge fan either.

The game sat for a very long time, considered multiple times to again be brought to table, but it never made it - too many other games to choose from, and that initial bad experience plus continuing AWESOME experiences with Twilight Struggle... means I just never wanted to try this one again. Sold at auction.

I really liked this in my first and only solo game, but one game like that was enough. I still give it a 7.5, because it actually is quite good and I guess it's much better with a real opponent.

RATING: 8
This card-driven game has, at first glance, much similarity to Twilight Struggle. However, there are many interesting differences that provide for a very different gaming experience, including solitaire play. The game is essentially the struggle between the US and Islamic Fundamentalists in a post 9/11 world. Card play is similar to many other CDG's with the choice of using either ops value or event with the proviso that if a card is played for ops and contains an enemy event the opposing player gets to play that event. The game play is asymetrical, with the US player getting to deploy troops, disrupt Jihadist Terror Cells, Expose plots and influence countries posture through 'war of ideas' rolls. The Jihadist gets to deploy / move cells, create terror plots  and attempt Jihad. The US has to get a number of resource producing countries to Good Governance, the Jihadist to Islamist Rule. An excellent game of nail-biting tension which drips theme. The solo variant is, once you get the hang of the flow chart, also excellent.

RATING: 7
Mixed feelings here. Tough game to learn; printed play-throughs, video guides, and session reports helped some, but game still feels opaque until you read a little bit about strategy and how to pursue achieving various objectives.

Found my solo learning game to be tedious due to AI flowchart (especially Travel--yikes!); enjoyed subsequent games much more once play flows a bit better and many game rule nuances were cleaned up. Would love to play against a real opponent to avoid flowchart slowdown. [3 plays]

RATING: 7.5
The game, though based on Twilight Struggle, adds two or three extra layers of complexity, and while this also adds strategic depth, it robs the experience of a lot of tension, since there is a tendency to spend the time thinking through all the layers and levels of the game, instead of simply trying to out think one's opponent. In the end, the experience amounts to Islamic Terrorist Whack-A-Mole, and the theme made me profoundly uneasy. I can't decide if this is because it reduces a serious world conflict to something playful, or because it allows the Jyhadist player to detonate a WMD in the U.S., or simply because it illustrates how impossible the task terrorist whack-a-mole really is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Really wanted to like this game, but there is too much riding on die rolls in diplomacy attempts and very little you can do to affect those rolls by gaining modifiers.  It seems to me that if the US really wants to improve relations with a certain country, it should be possible with greater than 1/6 odds of success with only one attempt per turn.

We played this a lot in the last year or so...
And we absolutely love it, there is so much tension going on and the asymmetry of the game actually shines. Right now we like it more than Twilight Struggle because of the fast paced gameplay and the asymmetry.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Labyrinth is in some ways three games in one, with asymmetric roles for US and Jihadist player each offering a distinct approach to the game and the US solo game providing a third. I can see this being a very cost effective follow up to Twilight Struggle for those who love CDGs.

However, I doubt I'd put this ahead of Twilight Struggle. The asymmetry is confusing at first, as you have to learn both sides at once to get a handle on the game. Moreover, there are several fiddly mechanisms tacked onto the game that I personally found a little annoying, such as rolling for Posture/Governance and rolling for pretty much everything as the Jihadist player. I get why this is "thematic," but the varied win conditions and the cards themselves did enough to establish the theme. The added fiddliness is just unnecessary.

In the end, yeah, I'll play this if someone else wants to, but I didn't find it to be terribly compelling. CDGs have yet to really click with me, and Twilight Struggle is far from played out here.

I will also note that I can see why some find the ideological slant to this game disturbing. It doesn't affect my rating, but I did find it obnoxious.

Complex, but maybe overly so.  It does a good job of recreating the WoT, but the cost for this is that the rules are fiddly and there are TONS of them (and lots of exceptions that apply to only card or situation) that you have to try to remember.  You will find yourself constantly checking the rulebook--at least for your first few plays and you will probably miss several (and mess up several) rules when you play.

This is truly an ambitious endeavor--potentially controversial subject matter, often misunderstood political situations, global scope of terrorism and counterterrorim, etc.  How does it do?  Well, pretty well, especially considering that it is an abstraction of the events, rather than a historical simulation.  For some reason that point is missed on several and they are having some issues with it.  UPDATE: The more I play it the more I enjoy it.  It is truly a tense game of multiple/opposite paths to victory.  Award(s):Charles S. Roberts Best Post-WW2 Era Board Wargame Winner (2010); James F. Dunnigan Design Elegance Award Winner (2010).

Deep, rich, thematic CDG. This game is harder than Twilight Struggle and as such is a little less accessible. I love the a-symmetry in Labyrinth and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys the COIN series, or is looking for a meaty look at modern conflict that puts the power in the players hand. This game is only as good as the Jihadists playing it. You have a bad Jihadist player, they will get crushed and the game will be less enjoyable.

I'll need more plays under my belt to properly rate and comment on Labyrinth (so take this with a grain of salt).  I've only played Twilight Struggle and Labryrinth once.  Compared to TS, Labyrinth felt less intuitive and more chaotic and fiddly.  Labyrinth also has a steeper learning curve as there were times i didn't know what to do.

I enjoyed this, but I also have to admit that it was designed from a decidedly conservative viewpoint. I'm a big Twilight Struggle fan, and I had heard that this is the closest thing to it without being designed by Jason Matthews. It does come very close, but it suffers from two issues. For one thing, the cards are not interesting. 13 Days had the same issue. Utilizing the cards is fun, but I didn't feel like I was waiting around for a particular card to enter play or anything. The other problem, and this is more of a personal preference, but it felt like I was shuffling troops around the board more than controlling counties. I get that this is one of the goals of the game, but it didn't *feel* like I was accomplishing this. It sort of felt like the opposite of 1989. 1989 had a very open board, and here it felt like you only had a few units that you had to concentrate to different areas. I guess that's the point, but I didn't find this nearly as engaging as TS. Still, I think this is worth playing if you enjoy TS. It just doesn't have that same magic that has made TS such a classic.

Really enjoy this one. Hits the theme spot on IMO. Another game that leads to many a Wikipedia rabbit hole. The asymmetric nature makes this game quite deep and strategic. I feel like once one player gets a couple good rolls it leads to a cascade of benefits that can be hard for the other player to overcome. Still trying to figure out how to battle out of a hole, but that fits well with the theme.

Although, I do feel awkward playing this one in public locations.

Amazing game - took me a while to build up the guts to learn it, and it was hard going for a simpleton like me, but once the rules fell into place I was eager to get playing, and the handful of two player games I've had have been brilliant.  Hopefully get some more 2 player games in soon.

Another layer was digesting the solo rules and learning how the AI works and I have to say this was great fun too, and has switched me onto the possibility of buying a COIN game.  Loads of replayability in this and would happily set up another game right this minute.

I regret bying this game. Its a "western" take on Islam = Terrorism and that is a biased and simplistic viewpoint. The world is much more complex than this, and the game as a typical american viewpoint of Islam.
Enough about that.

The game is ok, but thats not good enough in my book. I found it stale, static and boring. I may have leaned towards the games own "Realism" and tries to make it work work with completely different mechanism for each side in the game.
This however makes the rules needlessly complex and as with many games from GMT, one is left with wondering "Why should I do this action?". Only after a few plays does this become apparent, but the sterility of the map/cards/counters/pieces does not appeal to me, and so the game dies slowly, by making me lose interest.

This unofficial sequel to "Twilight Struggle" is truly great. It is asymmetric (like the real war on terror), but it is astoundingly well balanced. I love to play the single player variant, and I still can't believe that there is a game which is so much fun to play alone! All the cards, based on real events of our time, are fantastically well translated into the game (e.g. Saddam granting maximum funding for the Jihadist). Definitely one of the best games in my collection!

Probably the most well though out solitaire mechanic I've seen yet.  It feels like a real player conniving against me.  It does not always make, what seems to me, to be the best choices, but the mechanisms used (particular Radicalization) to balance don't seem all that artificial, either.  It feels like just another asymmetric rule within the game.

I pre-ordered based on the info here on BGG and GMT and that it was suitable as a solitaire game.  I am not at all disappointed!

I would love to go at this with another person side by side.  I'm guessing the tension would be unbelievable.

UK- I played all the scenarios solitaire. Nice solitaire game because the events are very important in the game. Too random and lack of strategic options for 2-player. 

Also the game makes many assumptions to be called as a simulation.

RATING: 7.65
After one full play, I'd say this is a pretty good game for such a complex topic.  Good balance although for two new players the pressure really is on the terrorists to make something effective happen. I'll wager that the U.S. player wins most games where two new players are involved.

Further playings have a good chance to raise my rating some more.

RATING: 7.5
L:WT is a card-driven game that simulates the conflict between the United States (and allies) and Al Quaida (and affiliates). I am learning L:WT with a mate. Both of us have played Twilight Struggle, and there are many similarities which has helped simplify the process. L:WT is an asymmetric game, however, and it "feels" very different to play. Both games achieve a great sense of tension (of immanent catastrophe, perhaps), but where TS involves fairly direct confrontation, L:WT has a sense of whack-a-mole. Cells appear, the US player swats them, plots appear, the US player stops them. Eventually one side or the other gets ahead in this cycle. This makes the game sound both simple and repetitive - neither of which is true because the decision process is very complicated.
After several games, all I can really say is that I want to play the game some more. I certainly don't have a real sense of strategy. I [i]am[/i] having a lot more enjoyment than playing TS.

RATING: 7
Compared to other CDGs like Twilight Struggle and 1989, I like the open-ended nature of this design. The event deck isn't split into eras, so any card may pop up at any time, and this can send the focus of the contest to virtually anywhere on the map, and each game can play out quite differently. Thus it feels less 'scripted' than those two Cold War CDGs.
On the minus side, Labyrinth is clunkier than those games, and some of the operations that rely on die rolling can be frustrating. I'm thinking especially of the War of Ideas operation for the US, where the roll is almost all or nothing (only almost because it's possible to get a consolation prize of Aid -giving a +1 modifier in that country in future-if you happen to roll 1 less than the target number).
I initially thought the way reserves are handled was irritating (why do I have to either spend all Ops points, or bank them all? And why, when I spend reserves, do I have to spend them all?), but on reflection, concluded this part of the design was intended to hobble Ops a little bit, to make events relatively more appealing. As Ops often predominate over Events in CDGs, I find this to be a good design decision.

Love the CDG nature and the assymetrical positions. A bit more of a dice fest than I expected (now we know why so many terrorist plots fail - who would have suspected that so many 1's needed to be rolled!) so there's plenty of luck to manage. The options and strategy, plus the time needed weighing up all your ops vs event decisions, is overwhelming and slow to begin with. Not only overwhelming, but the opaqueness of how-to-play-well seems like a huge barrier to entry re replay. I'm unsure how much the game will devolve to a whack-a-mole tug-of-war (jihadists set up a threat, US counters, repeat), but at least it holds the promise of plenty to explore until that's answered - and also even if it matters re enjoyment. The matching to theme seems super. It hasn't quite grabbed me yet, but I do want to explore it more to see how much it will.

Rather than a detailed review this is a rambling look at the solo experience of Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 - ?, so come with me as we head deeper into the maze.
After setting up the game you are confronted with a wealth of options as you head towards your ultimate goal of converting Muslim countries into allies with ‘good’ governance.  (Yes there are loaded terms in the game like ‘good’ and ‘poor’ but the nature of the story this game is trying to tell gives them meaning, even if I don’t always agree with that meaning.  Here ends the political discussion.)
As you play through the ‘Jihadist’ hand two cards at a time a flowchart directs what you will do with each card.  This sounds repetitive and a bit boring but the flowchart quickly becomes second nature to follow and creates some interesting situations which will force you to divert important events to combat.  And don’t be surprised if the flowchart plays a tough game, because it can. 
One of the big differences to the two-player game is the ‘radicalization’ event.  Unused operation points from a card go towards ‘radicalization’, which can lead to cells popping up in random countries and really keeps the US player on their toes.  It can seem like a lazy way to keep the game interesting and add an element of unpredictability to the flow of the game, but I actually like that this happens.  Terrorist or ‘Jihadist’ (as the game terms them) cells can spring up in countries without an actual person from an organisation visiting them, the internet and electronic communication allow this to happen, and while the game has a card which directly mentions this, talking about Terror groups using YouTube to record speeches, it’s not an event that happens once or twice a game, depending how many times the card shows up, but a constantly evolving thing.  ‘Radicalization’ also sees cells travelling which automatically succeeds or placing a plot into a non-Islamist rule country that contains a cell.  These are all things which will help to keep the US player on their toes.
I’ve enjoyed playing the solitaire version of Labyrinth, I found it a challenge and also a game I enjoyed playing.  This is all well and good, but is it a good simulation.  To me it stops being a historical simulation when the first card is played and becomes more of a sandbox, where players within the confines of the situation try and achieve outcomes that will grant them victory.  I suppose I’m trying to say that this is more of a ‘what-if?’ game than anything else.  Is it a perfect simulation of counterterrorism?  The more I read on the subject, I’m not sure, it’s a complex situation and any designer is going to have to make decisions about what is in and what is out of their design.  This sounds like a cop out but I don’t have a definitive answer, but will say I like the way the game works, and in my mind it does a fairly good job of representing what it sets out to.  Take that with a grain of salt, I’m no expert and others, with more knowledge than me (See Tom Grant’s informative review) have discussed this at length.
I’ll finish by saying I really enjoyed playing this solo and am glad to have the game back in my collection.

This does have some similarities to Twilight Struggle, but only in the card play. The board play is very different and works quite well with the theme. I am not sure that the theme will appeal to all, but as a game there is much more luck then other games of this type since you often have to roll a die to determine the outcome. I will stick to the other card driven games.

CDG on the American War on Terror, namely exercising regime change in Afghanistan and Iraq. Muslim countries has a detailed box indicating their governance from the American point of view (good, fair, poor or Islamic). There are also American allies which are hard or soft on the War on Terror and may help or hinder America's diplomatic efforts. The Jihadists use terrorist cells to plot attacks or launch a jihad to take control of a Muslim country, winning if they have enough countries under poor or Islamic rule, the Americans win if they can shift enough to Good and fair, though a WMD hitting New York can end the game real quick. The two players have different ways of raising troops and influencing governments and the cards have events and operational points like Twilight Struggle. There are some agonising choices as enemy events must usually be played to your detriment, figuring out how to limit their effect is the key to victory.

Played my first game solo. I like the concepts, but the solo game changed some of the basic rules. I also had a lot of rules questions for which I wasn't able to find answers. The flow chart is a nice idea, but at time I wasn't sure what to do. The rulebook seems to differ a bit from the flow chart too. The first game felt more like a chore than fun. I'm sure this game is more fun with 2 players.

The only other game of this ilk that I've played is 1960, so that's my basis of comparison.  I found this game to be a lot more thematically interesting, as both players were working toward entirely different ends.  I really enjoyed how I was trying to push forward my objectives, while at the same time trying to keep my opponent in check.  However, the game had a lot more dice luck than I would have liked.  To some degree, I felt it was dice luck rather than any particular strategy that won the game.

Labyrinth seems to work as a game, albeit a tad chaotically. However, as a representation of the Great War On Terror it is a nakedly ideological fantasia in which the jihadists are a monolithic entity and Islamic nations may be persuaded of reform with just a little State Department effort. In short, it is bollocks, but I'll concede that it is entertaining bollocks.

Labyrinth is a similar game as Twilight struggle in many respects: design, quality, card driven game etc. I did not get a chance to play 1 vs 1, I mainly bought it to play solo. By far, this is the hardest board game I've had to learn. Although the instructions follow the GMT presentation, I often had to search for specifics in the 4 different manuals given, my last one being a game example to understand certain definitions and priority of events. Figuring what comes first in terms of actions for your opponent is key and a little daunting initially. At first, the instructions and flow charts are a little hard to master, but things get smoother once you write the missing information at the right spots. I had to go and watch a tutorial on Youtube to address certain issues. Secondly, there are a lot of things to consider and remember when you complete your turn: markers to move, terror plots to activate etc... It has happened to me a couple of times that I had played 1 or 2 turns and realized that an action should of been resolved in an isolated part of the map or that I should of reduced my die roll by one on a particular roll. This said, I have played three games and I am finally edging towards playing the game correctly with all its rules. I found my experience frustrating at first, but more fun as I learned the game. It is a game that easily lasts 1-2 hours but speed can be dependent of the player and his attention to detail. Despite all these hiccups, I am giving this game a 9.0 since it is a great game and a definite advancement for a serious solo strategy game with a great theme, great replayability and made out of quality components.

This is a really great game.  The dilemma for the US to try to hold onto World Prestige, while still taking action against terrorism builds a real sense of tension.  The game allows for the US to move between hard and soft approaches to terrorism.  The terrorists also have quite a lot of options between terrorist plots and overthrowing/destabilizing moderate Muslim regimes.  This game exemplifies the ongoing evolution of the CDG's and is in fact, the best to date.

The theme is either pure fantasy or pure propaganda.

The imperialism war over resources in the middle East, so called “War on Terror” killed more than 1.3 millions Iraqis, and thousands of young Americans, and it cost more than 1 trillion dollars which could have been spent in fighting the global warming or other projects beneficial to the whole mankind.

I'm not used to rate games I haven’t played, and I'm not used to rate games on moral criteria either, but I will not support barbarity and I will never play this game. GMT, you should choose better themes for the games you publish.

After more plays, I can say this is a terrible game. You spend about 2 hours or more doing nothing but rolling a D6, and the entire outcome of the game is based on it. Every game I've played, its come down to a 50/50 roll of the die to determine the winner. No, it wasn't that the game was close, it was that everything in the game is a stupid die roll.

28/05/2013: Purchased

06/06/2013: Rating of 7 after a solo learning game. First impression was the clunkiness of the mechanics involved, and having to know which action is required to boost each resource (i.e. US Prestige and Jihad funding). Didn't feel the same nail-biting intensity that I experienced during my first play of Twilight Struggle. Will give it another try to account for potential of wrong rules played, though gameplay seemed to drag midway during the session. 

07/06/2013: Tried a second game, with exactly the same experience as the first. The game simply could not justify its length, as the theme simply did not grab me and the intensity which is expected of a 2-player game didn't strike me as being very substantial here. Overall, a very poor cousin of the number one game in BGG.

Labyrinth: The Awakening, 2010 – ? expansion[/b]

My very first CDG. Really opened my eyes to how deeply layered and challenging a board game can be.

So much to consider, so many different paths to victory and incredible twists along the way. Pulls you deep into it's world, and the horrors abound, in a way that Twilight Struggle simply was not able to for me.

I couldn't care less how politically correct it is, or isn't, or how accurate a view into the real-life crisis it offers..

This provides exactly the kind of tense and vicious experience I am looking for when I take a boardgame down from my shelf.

[B]**UPDATE** 1/21/14 [/B]
My rating is going up. This may be my favorite game. The more I play it, and get to know it's ins and outs, the more I am in awe of the design and the incredible, nail-biting narrative it brings to the table with each and every play. 

Do I like it more than POG? Maybe not. But I do get to play it far more often, have gotten to know the rules much better, and it just doesn't make me feel as daunted or confused as POG can tend to. 

Besides, the threat of having a nuclear bomb go off right in downtown Manhattan, is always going to hold more tension for me than wondering if Verdun is going to fall or not..

RATING: 8
Dec. 2010: My comments after one play as the Jihadists.

The one main thing I truly appreciated about this game: The scope of the game, which is according to the box is 2001 - ?, is actually limited to the first decade of this century. I was worried that the designer would try to speculate how this war would turn out and inflict an even more skewered bias from the US point-of-view. Consequently, the game focuses on events of the recent past, not the assumed future, and its victory conditions are smaller scale (i.e. the Jihadists can win by bringing a WMD to the US, rather than something esoteric and epic like cultural dominance over the Western world.)

Comparing Labyrinth to Twilight Struggle

When I first played Twilight Struggle, I had a very hard time absorbing the rules. It's because realignment and coups are handled very abstractly. There are no units in the traditional sense as in other war games.  A unit is instead an amount of influence in a given country or territory. In Labyrinth, there are actually units on the board: troops for the US and sleeper/active cells for the Jihadists. Therefore, all the actions that players can take made far more sense to me in Labyrinth.

(I would later read a historical account of the Cold War, which eventually helped me truly appreciate Twilight Struggle.)

I found that Twilight Struggle had better tension that Labyrinth. However, TS's tension is artificial compared to Labyrinth. TS generates that tensions with scoring cards. So players don't know when the scoring card comes up, but because the deck is semi-stacked, they have an vague idea and can try to anticipate the arrival of these cards. In Labyrinth, the victory conditions are more traditional, in a sense: control or occupy a certain number of specified countries. But because these objectives are open and take time to accomplish, it's not as exciting as TS. It's almost like playing chess with a far stronger player than yourself. You are simply watching yourself suffer a slow death -- because conquering a country can take several turns, in some cases, it does feel like this. Still, this I find thematically more realistic than TS's area majority scoring. (Although how it's implemented in TS it does make thematic sense in a very abstract way -- for example, trying to gain extra countries in a pointless place like South America simply because I figured out there's a scoring card coming up I think mimics the seemingly inexplicable and un-strategic battles the USSR and the US got themselves into.) 

Some other comparisons:
* The cards in TS are more interesting and varied than in Labyrinth. Interestingly, though, when you're forced to play an opponent's event, there's often a condition that must be satisfied in order for the event to be activated, which mitigates somewhat the luck in this mechanic.
* You could save up points from one card and add it to another card, which also mitigates some luck

As for the implementation of politics in a war game: Labyrinth does this by abstracting various political aspects into a numerical value that gives a die-roll modifier. Personally, I found it very clever how the designer abstracted politics in this game.

Still, I'm not a big fan of card driven war games. I don't like the fact that I can't anticipate my opponent's moves until I fully know what's in the entire deck of cards. Also, I would've preferred to see politics modelled as politics, so there would be some kind of negotiation, but I fully understand that that's too much to ask for from a two-player game.

Is this worth purchasing if you own Twilight Struggle? If you:

* Like the theme of the US War Against Terror, don't mind that this is a game narrated from an American point-of-view, and the somewhat shallow and naive treatment of this war (this is not to say that I'm an expert on this conflict; I simply felt that the story that this game offers is the same one the mass media has told us)

* You could handle more complicated rules than TS. However, I found the implementation of theme better here in Labyrinth than in TS and thus was able to absorb the rules much faster.

* It might be too early to tell, but I have a feeling that TS is more strategic than Labyrinth.

RATING: 7.5
An interesting game. It is not a "simulation" of the War on Terror by any means, as Jihadists are portrayed as some kind of cohesive Illuminati-like organization that seems taken from a James Bond movie: For example, one cell recruited in Morocco may be planting a bomb in Philippines in no time. 

But the mechanics are solid and the game is fun, so although the theme fails, this one is here to stay in my collection. Also, too many die rolls may turn off those that don't like that a good streak may make one player win too easily.

Took five months to actually open and play the game, but have really, really enjoyed the games I've played. Always one on the go on ACTS. Two deck definitely the way to go. Perhaps not as dynamic as TS, but engrossing. Games have been close and I enjoy the intelligent theme and approach to a divisive conflict. In many ways it is a reactionary game, you spend your time starting fires (Jihadists) and putting them out (US) - can be particularly frustrating for the US. 

As a solo game, it works but I find it a bit dull and repetative. Rated 5 for solo - although using the Python Programme was a good experience and cuts out the spreadsheet.

UPDATE: Keep on playing this, so need to give it a 10 while I'm enjoying it so much. Don't need to think too much. The go-to CDG at the moment.

Just as intense as Twilight Struggle, and the theme is more current. Mechanically, a lot depends on die rolls, but hand management/card play is the key. Like TS, you can play a card for the op points or the event--if it's the opponent's event, you really have to watch the timing. Highly thematic and highly stressful. Rating is based on the first play--which I enjoyed a lot.

RATING: 5
There is a lot of value to this game. I really like how the creator put a lot of effort combing through events that had occurred in the last decade and putting them in the game. I need more plays to really give a better opinion of this game. As it is, I've only tried this about 3-4 times with others and maybe twice by myself. I really like what the game is trying to do. I just think the game doesn't come off as easy to understand and especially difficult in determining what the best move to do is. If these issues could have been worked on, I would totally bring it out more often. As it is, it will probably just sit around until I sell it. One friend I played it with just had to stop playing because playing as the Jihadists was emotionally affecting him. Quite a response!

Preliminary rating of 8.5 based on one play. I really like the 2 card plays each impulse, as that makes it easy to play cards in combination and enhance their power.

The game seems to have a very steep learning curve. It is difficult sometimes to think of something productive to do with your ops.

It was becoming more clear towards the end of the game, and I am fairly confident my preliminary rating will rise with additional plays.

RATING: 5
Innovative asymmetrical CDG. Playing US gets you the feel of a republican president. US is trying to grab muslim worlds resources into its use, while Jihadists are trying to create enough totalitarian islamist paradises or set weapon of mass destruction in the US (if WMD goes off elsewhere its not such a big deal). As its sometimes good US strategy to launch Martyrdom Operations in US just to shake things up, this is not a game for someone who has easily moral qualms.

The game has a lot more dice throwing than usual CDGs and sometimes especially prestige rolls can shift the balance perhaps a bit too much for someones taste. 

I don't actually think the simulation side is very accurate, but it gives hooks for learning about the events and that is enough in my book.

Generally I like the game and it gets a big plus from soloplay (yes there is a way to play CDGs solo now... not that I'm doing it).

Found this to be a little more complex, or perhaps less intuitive, than Twilight Struggle - but once we got into it I found it really enjoyable nonetheless.  Jihadist have so far won 4 of our 5 plays, not sure if this is typical.  Interestingly, each play has produced victory by a different method.  The USA victory was on the back of keeping Islamist funding under pressure the entire game, whilst building towards 12 good resources.  Very good game, want to play again - but so many things to play and so little time.

Much less certainty that you can effect your will in this game than Twilight Struggle.  Try to get three points and hope the dice work for you.  Can spend entire turns spinning your wheels without doing anything but rolling and hoping.  That being said, you can play your events, sure!  

Too easy for Jihadist?

Assymetric, which is good, but it's billed and feels like a strategic game . . .

. . . but it plays out like an experience game; your decisions merely influence a game that seems to play itself!

Better geopolitical fix than Twilight Struggle. Everything I like about Twilight Struggle is there, but there's so much more. TS tends to be more game than simulation, and the narrative suffers for it. Whether you agree with the designer's take, Labyrinth sets out to be more than a game and as a result has you thinking less in terms of VPs and more in terms of the actions and consequences that are playing out on the board.

[b]Sold via BGG Marketplace January 2016[/b] - [i]Intend to buy again once the new printing comes out.[/i]

Here's my mini-review based on five plays of the game. The first three plays lasted only through most of one deck each as I discovered I was making fairly important and routine errors. The last two games were played to completion and were played with only fairly minor errors as my understanding of the game came together.

:d10-1: [b]Overview of the Game[/b]

Labyrinth can be played either with two players or as a solitaire game (which this review focuses on) and depicts the struggle for dominance in the Global War on Terror between the U.S. and the Jihadist sides immediately after September 11, 2001. During the solitaire game, the player takes the side of the U.S. player and strives to defeat the Jihadist side. The Jihadist side is governed by a flow chart which the player uses to determine the Jihadist moves as well as quite a few rules from the two player game that are modified to suit the one player game. The game has a variable length which is determined by how many times you run through the card deck though sudden game end victory conditions can occur at any point during the first, second, or third deck. This is a card driven game, so the opportunities given to each side are determined by a hand of cards dealt to each player each turn. The cards are all based on events that have happened during real world events. This game is highly asymmetrical and each faction has its own unique actions that it uses to accomplish its goals. As far as BGG users are concerned, this game sits in both the strategy game and war game subdomains. To me, this is very much a grand strategy game that depicts the struggle utilizing martial, diplomatic, civil, and cultural means. It is by no means a traditional war game in view of its rules or gameplay, nor would I ultimately categorize it as such. Though there is no denying the fact that it most strongly evokes the feeling of a war game with its implementation, art, and theme. 

:d10-2: [b]Overview of the Rules[/b]

The rule book is laid out very helpfully and sensibly. The player first reads through a description of game components as well as concepts. Then the player is taken through the rulebook procedurally so that one section logically builds on the previous section. The rules are concise and without fluff. This is good in that there is no wasted or superfluous text. It may leave some players wanting for more clarification though. Also included is a playbook which the player should use to get a feel for how the game is actually played. I recommend setting up the game as described in the playbook and actually flipping the cards and moving the pieces as described by the book. The playbook contains sections both for the two player game and the single player game. Another important thing to note is that many of the rules of the game differ from the two player to the one player game. In addition to obviously having a solid comprehension of the one player rules, the player must read and understand well all the two player rules first as most are used for the one player game. Understanding which rules are the same between games and which are modified for the solitaire game is extremely important to successful play the solitaire game and may also be quite challenging to grasp during the first few plays. Overall the rule book is fairly easy and even enjoyable to read. I came away from my first read through feeling good about my understanding of the game. The challenge with the rules came during game play as I tried to put it all together and properly implement the event cards and gameplay. The interactions between cards, situations on the game board, and player actions combine to give the rules a weight of medium/heavy in my estimation, which is more complex than I thought while I was reading the rules.

:d10-3: [b]Things I don't Like[/b]

Even though the rules were easy to read through, the game was still hard to grasp during my initial plays. As such, I would have personally preferred the designer illustrate the rules with examples more frequently than he did (although he did a fine job as is) as well as add a little more language to certain rules here and there to help with clarification.

There's not really anything that I don't like with this game, so that minor niggle will have to suffice for this section.

:d10-4: [b]Things I really Like[/b]

The game really immersed me in the events depicted. For all the abstractness of the game I feel like it does an excellent job immersing me completely in the theme. Much of this is due to the excellent artwork on the cards and board, but also the asymmetrical nature of the game play and player actions. 

The art and layout of the game are very well done and of a high quality.

The decisions the player faces are many, the options the player has are many, and the challenge is great. There are always productive actions to be taken even though some hinge on the roll of a die. The Jihadist side is very finely tuned and for a flowchart gives the impression of a crafty and tenacious enemy. It honestly felt like my moves were being countered by a real player. I found the game very fun to play because the AI rules make the Jihadist such a challenging opponent with human qualities. All this combined to make each card play of each game feel meaningful and tense. 

I played this game five times and had it set up continually. I'd go down to play a few brief turns at a time and would end up playing for a couple hours. Labyrinth gave me the same feeling I get from some of my favorite 4X computer games; just one more turn, I need just one more turn. I felt like I was always on the cusp of something big, but then the AI would stymie me and leave me feeling a major feat was just beyond my grasp so I'd have to play more.

:d10-5: Summary and Score(use whatever scoring system you would like to use).

I really enjoyed playing this game, even when I knew my understanding of gameplay wasn't great. It kept pulling me back for one more hand. I kept setting it up for a new game once I finished the current game. I see myself playing this game soon and it being a highly cherished game into the future.

I recommend this to anyone interested in the theme. Also to anyone who wants a challenging game where the decisions feel very meaningful and tense. If you enjoy luck and some randomization that still leaves you feeling that you can win and you can overcome clever play by your opponent you should really enjoy this game.

My first impression to Labyrinth is: A Child of Twilight Struggle. But after reading the rules and play some sessions I know it's totally different except for the map of the world. It's about US vs Terrorism. The US side should conduct diplomacy to befriend the Middle East country (and crack down the Islamist government), and the Jihadist side should sabotage the world and set up their own power. The theme is interesting, which gives it potential for a better rating in the future.

Not really my thing, not interested in terorism, I'm more of a battlefield and armies man, but truth be told the unfamiliarity with it got me curious and people really seem to like it.

So will be fun to explore this.

As a game, it's not bad: there's a lot of dice rolling and getting a 6 or 1 at the right time might turn the course of the game. However, the two sides are suitably different for an asymmetric game. I like how you have spheres of conflict on various intertwining levels: keeping funding up/down, promoting/preventing the spread of cells, US prestige and global support, governance etc. 

Some things are less successful. The big deck and fact that you often will only play through it once mean that the "remove" card instructions are rather pointless. I don't think there's enough game there to play through 2 or 3 decks, and I wonder how an extended game affects balance. There are also too many cards dealing with Iraq when an invasion of Iraq may never happen. As a result, many events will simply not be playable. Consequently, it's not quite as tense a game as Twilight Struggle, especially with regard to hand management.  

As a simulation, well, it simulates something, but what that is. . .and in what realm it is taking place. . .?

The solo version is welcome and sufficiently diverting, but I'd say it's not worth getting for solitaire play alone.

My first GMT purchase.  I really enjoy this game.  I use the web application for solitaire play and that makes it less of a hassel.  I leave the game setup in a rarely used room, and just come play a few turns when I have the time.

Doubtless this game is a brilliantly designed experience about the world on terror ... but like a lot of GMT titles this swings between gorgeous theme and terrible rule reading during the game. I am happy to have tested it but I am also happy that I traded it for another more accessible game. What's really amazing about the components is again the original photographs on the cards ... they really thicken the theme.

RATING: 7
I have only played the solo version thus far.  I like the idea, just not sure how much I like actually using the flow chart concept for the AI.  It can get a little tedious but still a nice (and new) idea for the solitaire game engine.

Finally played the 2 player game and really like the blend of events and asymmetrical strategies.  I've come to like games where you can trigger your opponents events with the one deck system.  It adds that extra element of hand management to the decision making requirements.  This game has good balance of decision making and multiple paths to victory which leads to good replay value and tight game play. Playing 2 cards per action is a nice twist on the CDG mechanic (when its your turn of course).

Perhaps the best fantasy game of 2010?

UPDATE: OK, it deserves more than a little snark.  This is a smert game with a lot going for it.  If you, like me, were taken aback by the oozing sheen of neocon-isms throughout the production, I urge you to hold your nose and play it a couple times, preferably as both sides so you can see more of the whole picture.

There are obvious similarities to Twilight Struggle.  The most important non-obvious similarity (to me) is that the game is not "historical" in the usual sense.  Twilight Struggle took the historical invective of the participants at face value; for instance, the Domino Theory is truly in force in the game.  Similarly, Labyrinth posits a universe in which the propaganda of both sides is True.  It's not our universe, but it's an interesting one to game in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
One of my favourite board games. It takes the winning formula popularized by Twilight Struggle and its card-driven predecessors and takes it to the next level. The assymetric nature of the war on terror is captured perfectly, and the game appears to be perfectly balanced. It is tense, thematic, and incredibly fun. The solitaire system is spot-on as well. The AI of the enemy is ruthlessly effective, and there are varying levels of difficulty to try out. Stated simply, this is an AMAZING board game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Has quickly catapulted up to the top of my CDG collection.  Simple, elegant mechanics that convey a lot and provide a compelling narrative.  I understand the designer's intent of providing incentives for each player to understand the world through the prism of the time rather than with the benefit of hindsight, and in the end I think complaints of the game's neoconservative slant are ultimately misplaced.  This is an excellent game, and well worth the playing.

Have played this once, but I found it difficult to grasp initially and integrate all of the 'moving parts' into a sound gameplaying experience. Difficult to start up again, many other players are very intimidated by it due to the asymmetrical nature between the rules and playstyles governing the opposing sides. I can tell it's a good game, and I want to learn it better.

Beautiful componants, one reason I like it is because it fits well into my playing schedule. Sometimes I have a spare half hour or so and can fit a few rounds in. I appreciate the designer making is playable solitaire. I didn't care for it at first but now I like the game quite well. I find myself wanting to play it more. Pretty decent game 
******************************
Does it simulate The War on Terror? Since I am not an expert, I can't say. I will say there will be developments in the future with The War on Terror so I would think the game would need to be updated with new cards from time to time. I don't see a conclusion to The War on Terror any time soon. I just added this here in August of 2014. Since the game came out you had the Arab Spring, Syrian crisis, and ISIS which illustrates my point.

Got the expansion and did not like it, seemed more scripted, more complexity than what it was worth. Just going to stick with original game when I play it again.

Egyedül próbáltam ki elsőre a TS ötleten alapuló játékot. Persze a szabályok nem kellő ismerete mellett sokáig tartott, főleg, hogy lepörgött a pakli. Összességében úgy éreztem hiába van több fajta akciólehetőség az USA kezében, az ideológiák háborúja a legtöbbet használt. Az egy játékos AI teljesen jól működik, gondolkodásra készteti a játékost. Számomra az egyes események is kicsit szürkébbek, mint a TS esetén. Összességében már látom, hogy második játékra hibátlanul játszva nagyobb élmény lesz és látom a potenciált a játékban, de a TS azért jobb mindenképpen. A szerencse kb. ugyanolyan szintű. Ez a játék azonban egyértelműen nehezebb, a tanulás szempontjából mindenképpen, de a pontos játék szempontjából is. Érdekes, hogy a nehézségük ugyanolyan itt a BGG-n. Kíváncsi vagyok a két játékos változatra!

Két játékossal is jól működik a játék, de nem éreztem létjogosultságát részemről a TS mellé. Egyértelműen annak ajánlom, aki szeret egyedül játszani.

In my opinion much better than Twilight Struggle. The game is focused on developing the best strategy with a very different approach by the two opposing side.

RATING: 2
Possibly I was too tired to be trying a new game, but I don't think being wide awake would have mattered.  This game is an exercise in making bad to worse decisions.  The worst part is it just doesn't matter because you have to go ahead with the choices anyway.  You only get to control the order that the pain comes in.  Most of the possible "good" cards become impossible to use as the penalties pile up.  Unlike Twilight Struggle you don't really have options to mitigate the bad or ditch cards as readily.  Have to say I don't really look forward to playing this again.

Slightly bigger learning curve than Twilight Struggle since the sides are asymmetric, but you get the hang of it after a few turn.  I like the troops on the board, which make it a more visual game.
On the down side, there is a lot of info to track and there is a propaganda element to the treatment of the game that I'm not comfortable with.  The big fat single deck is big let down too.  Makes very event a play it or lose it.  Also, why does the game need duplicate cards?

"For trade" is only to local SF Peninsula individuals.  Sorry, but I can't be bothered to box it up.  Please don't ask me.

Hmm...Not sure how to think about this game.  I played it once as the US and once as the Jihadists and both games turned out the same way.  Afghanistan Regime Change, Jihadists slowly migrate to other arenas to try to set up a new base, US goes Soft and starts turning governments starting with the Gulf States into Good governance countries.  Then it was kind of a race between the set up of new Islamic Rule countries in places the US couldn't really influence and the US gradually working governance higher in the crescent from Saudi Arabia up to Afghanistan.

Both games felt surprisingly multiplayer solitaire-y, with little to be gained by the two sides in actually situating their forces/cells in the same countries as the other (well, the US wants to but can't, and the Jihadists generally don't seem incentivized to).  So as a result each player is just trying to obstruct the other's victory path with events while they pursue theirs at top speed.  I'm not suggesting that's not reasonable, it just didn't seem...fun.

Maybe if the US stays at Hard posture for longer (in our case both posture changes were driven by events) the game is more combative/confrontational.  It seems as though that is how the game may be more interactive.  But I don't know that I'm going to give it another try--the game was a very interesting study, but hasn't grabbed me as a game.

Quite annoying Rulebook. The game mechanics are functional, but are far from beeing elegant or intuitive, neither do they fit well to the topic. The theme was never strong in this one. Most important: the games viewpoint to the conflict it is portraying (e.g. what is a "good" result?, what is success?, how to achieve victory?)  is quite strange and rightwingish. All in all a game I did not enjoy at all in theme, mechanics and synopsis of the conflict.

I like the game a lot. It reminds me of Twilight Struggle, in the sense that it isn't clear what the best strategy is immediately.  But it doesn't strike me as quite as clean and polished as TS is.

Labyrinth: The War on Terror 2001-? offers besides the question mark on the other side of the time span firstly lots of fun and tension. You can stop terrorism with your own strengths, or at least cut its wings a little. But while one player takes side of United States, the other will leads muslim to their sacred war and try to blow up a weapon of mass destruction in USA. Tense board game revolves around one of three available scenarios according to historical background and you influence it by playing cards. Lots of your successes and failures is decided only with roll of the dice, which adds to the tension, but also can discourage some players from buying this game. Labyrint his quite difficult to master, given all those tiny rules, but you will be rewarded with really subtle gameplay. This board game really excels in area of atmosphere and experience enhanced by luxury board and lots of different tokens to track countries status. So if you are a little interested in history, terrorism or you just want to play excellently balanced game for two players, do not hesitate to buy this one!

While soem may compare this to Twillight Struggle or 1989, despite sharing similar elements it offers a different feel thanks to a great asymetry in gameplay. It's onyl logical that mighty superpower USA will play very differently than Jihadists who lack the means of a grand scale but are good in operating in shadows. If you are interested in the theme you should definitely pick this one for your collection.

On the fence about this one after a single play. I have not tried the solitaire rules maybe that will increase my rating. Definitely need to try the 2 player again, US just seems too limited on what it can do.

RATING: 8
Right up front: it's not the legend that Twilight Struggle is.  But it doesn't matter.  It generates fantastic narratives and a very palpable tension, and like so many good games, one tends to end turns thinking of all the other things there just wasn't enough time to do.  The solo game takes a bit of getting used to, but once it clicks, the play time drops and the enjoyment continues to rise.
My wife likes it more than Twilight Struggle, so really, my life rocks.

A note on the accuracy of the game: I don't agree with the game's assumption that Radical Islam was ever much of a threat to global security, or that military force could ever hope to bring about a stable Muslim world.  Doesn't matter.  This game is a simulation of that worldview, not an endorsement of it.  Enjoy it for what it is.

The obvious comparison is to Twilight Struggle (because of the opposition events mechanic), but there's a lot more going on here.  The asymmetric play of Labyrinth pushes it over the top for me.  I wasn't sold on the theme at first, but it's perhaps the only game on the subject.

Just started learning this game and have played it solo. Love all the historical stuff and have learnt quite a bit from the cards. It's is a difficult subject and this game holds to the mainstream view of events, while many of us outside US would hold to Noam Chomsky's view that State terrorism is just as bad and usually worse than the small scale terrorism of individuals. Still the game is very solid and I am enjoying it, the only thing I am yet to reconcile myself with is the dice rolling aspect. If after many plays I discover that good play will always mitigate bad luck then I will raise the score but I typically like as little luck as possible in strategic level games.

RATING: 9
A really interesting game which brings a lot of information about the strange war between US and the Jihadists. The conflict is well-rendered and surprisingly objective. I suspect a bit of a hawkish bias but it is more present in the commentary (flavour-text, commentary about the cards) than in the mechanics.

Furthermore, the solitaire aspect is really well-rendered. the flow-chart for the jihadists is a bit fastidious at times but it is necessary, I think, to have a functional and (relatively) efficient AI. I had to play like against a real adversary.

My first play was really fun, bringing the frustration of the US situation, the temptation of the "dark side", a commitment to long term strategy (I played a 3-deck campaign and the low funding had effects on the long-term) and finally a great ending (a sort of Arab spring brought Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Jordan to Good governance rather quickly => the Jihadists couldn't react due to low funding). I like to think the US commitment to soft strategy won me the game in the end (with a muslim world departing for its age-long defiance about the US and a prestige finally climbing to the heights).

The 2-player experience is also very fun. Completely different feeling for the US (and more difficult as the Jihadists are much better organised). I was taken by surprise and my adversary was very good at exploiting my difficulties. At the end of the first game, I immedialtely wanted to begin a new one (PBEM-game) which is always a good sign. The second game is really thrilling too with surprising devleopments (just now I made a reassessment to Soft just to have the Jihadists play Axis of Evil and putting my prestige by -6 in the process).

The game has really the potential to become one of my favorites.

Rating of 7 for Solitaire play only. I can't recommend this for 2 players as the Jihad players OPS/actions are determined solely by die rolls. This much randomness will work better for solitaire play, but when your playing the Jihadist side and attempting to use strategy you can be hampered by some, or in most cases, a lot of unlucky die rolls. You'll have to remember all the rules unless you download some of the user created Play Aids. These will also shorten the learning curve. Overall a strong solitaire game.

Labyrinth takes 1 or 2 players inside the Islamist jihad and the global war on terror. With broad scope, ease of play, and a never-ending variety of event combinations similar to GMT’s highly popular Twilight Struggle, Labyrinth portrays not only the US efforts to counter extremists’ use of terrorist tactics but the wider ideological struggle — guerrilla warfare, regime change, democratization, and much more.

RATING: 1
Some might argue my rating is unfair because it's not based on gameplay.  However, I see it as balance, especially in comparison of ratings of games that many find offensive such as Letters from Whitechapel.

Labyrinth is political propaganda. It presents a B&W pov with the good US against an evil Islamic force. I am not attempting in any way to defend terrorism.  Rather, I'm opposing the childish mentality that it's white hat vs. the black hats. It's a bit more complicated than that.

As a former US Army Intel Analyst and someone who has witnessed the deaths of innocent Iraqi civilians I find this game to be nothing less than offensive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The biggest issue in this game for me is randomness. Not only due to dice rolling but also there are some powerful cards that can go in favor of one of the sides (and this is not counting events like drawing three of  Suicide Attack cards in one draw by the US, as it happened to me).
That being said if you know the mechanics and the cards well, some of the games will be interesting and tense. So if you bought the game, don't give up after few plays - if you like Twilight Struggle you'll likely enjoy Labyrinth as well.

This is a fun game of tug of war, where you play on the edge, setting up crises and putting them out, choosing carefully where to take chances for big rewards.  I like that one can often figure out ways to mitigate the negative effects of opponent events.  It doesn't require nearly the card knowledge of Twilight Struggle, and though a better player will probably always win, it is still a fun game to play against newer players.

I don't think this game is the neo-con wetdream some of its detractors make it out to be, but it is very reliant on die rolls. I won't compare it to that *other* GMT game, but I do think it's a middle-of-the-road CDG. I would recommend  other COIN games over this.

RATING: 6
The game is wholly asymmetric, with not a single option being the same for both players.  That alone makes it unique and thematic.  Mechanically the game is sound, though incredibly difficult to grasp.  This I could tolerate, if the game was strategically compelling.  It unfortunately isn't.  Planning is too difficult to do, as nearly every significant play requires die rolls that you are usually going to fail.  A 50/50 die roll is good odds in this game.  You already have the variability of the cards to plan for, and layering a low probability die roll on top of it makes it even less compelling.  Lest ye cast stones, I love randomness.  Dice usually inject drama, but here they inject a feeling of futility interrupted by the occasional surprising success.

This game is missing the tension of [gameid=12333] with its normally predictable flow.  Here, the events kind of just happen.  Too many of the events are silver bullets to counteract others, and the theme is difficult to follow, as these events get pretty obscure, and are fading from memory less than 10 years after they happened.  

I was hoping that this game would allow the War on Terror to be waged in a wholly different fashion, but for the most part, this assumes the same general strategy of fighting the war as was taken historically by the Bush presidency.

Ultimately, the game has a unique theme, but its unintuitive mechanics and lack of conviction make it unsatisfying to play.

Plays similar to Twilight Struggle. But more complicated than TS, which is a minus. Playing as the US is WAY harder in Labyrinth than TS; so much so that it's practically a minus.  Can see the complaints regarding the "ideology".

Still haven't finished a game of it, which is frustrating.  Even more frustrating is that none of the games got the rules right.  Considering how rarely it gets to the table and how incredibly complex it is, I've been considering selling it or trading it for something else.  Haven't decided but it's been weighing on my mind.

The only (only!) complaint after over 20 plays is that sometimes the end of the world syndrome creeps in. Does the game end in two turns? Then I need to invade this country so it doesn't count as Islamist Rule, and probably he won't have time to get it back. Very gamey.

[i]Preliminary rating after one 2-player game[/i].

Controversial, but extremely interesting geopolitical theme. I love the asymmetric goals of both sides of the conflict and the slightly tweaked card-driven system known from Twilight Struggle (now you can play two cards back to back and this really changes the overall dynamic of the game). Players are forced to make deliciously agonizing choices every single turn and that's always something I look for in games.

Unfortunately, the ultra-steep learning curve combined with big rules overhead and significant randomness somewhat diminish the fun I had with Labyrinth (the swingy nature of some rolls may put you in the hole you won't be able to dig out from for a long time - if ever). Twilight Struggle is twice less complex and still manages to provide a fantastic gaming experience. Labyrinth has a lot of great features and concepts (and executes its theme flawlessly), but as a whole it promises to deliver more than it actually does. 

Still, I definitely need to spend more time with this game to form a final opinion, Labyrinth really has a lot  going for it and I won't give up on exploring its intricacies that easily. I suspect that at some point the positives will outshine certain problems I have with it. I keep thinking about it and that's always a sign of an involving game.

Updated August 2014. Raised this after another play. What a terrific game, as the strategic structure of the game becomes clearer. If the US manages to reduce Jihadist funding (and keep it low), then disrupt all the cells on board, the Jihadist is seriously restricted in his options. Vice versa, Jihadist has great options of undermining US efforts of improving governance, by crippling US resources through plots and/or reducing US prestige. This is an amazing game that captures what I can only guess is the essence of this conflict - a global stalling or 'stand of' of endeavors to alter the governance of the Middle East. "Labyrinth" indeed!

Only logged 1 play, but really enjoyed it. Theme is fantastic, and after much rumination and my own research (incl. OUP's "Accidental Guerilla") I can't any longer side with the highest rated review of the game, here on BGG, which says the game makes wild assumptions unfounded by actual research.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A solid CDG. Players play 2 cards at once which opens up new strategies. Most card plays force some kind of dice check which unfortunately will fail very very often. This can lead to many wasted actions and what only seems like an awful lot of luck. Eventually you will overcome this apparent shortcoming (i mostly have) and find it is a fun and interesting game with many different approaches to strategy.
Two deck games are always more fun than a single deck but it doubles the game time. Three deck games are usually decided by the 2nd deck and are not worth the extra time.

An utter travesty of a simulation.  A fantasy, but unlike those with orcs and elves and hobbits, this fantasy pushes forward a campaign of propaganda aimed at supporting war after war after war, at supporting torture and murder and worse.  America as a stabilizing force in the Middle East?  Pure farce.  And the fact that people, mostly Americans, are gobbling it up is a sad reflection on the modern citizen.

Maybe my first real experience of an asymmetrical game. I started solo and had the chance to play with my brother, and that is much more fun. Solo is hard. In fact the game is basically hard. The US player is tiptoeing all the time, crossing fingers to make nice dice rolls and thus liberate his military resources. The jyhadist player looks to have a bit more freedom in his decisions but is challenged when trying to mount a real threat.
It is a really great game in which nothing is really granted, even when things look to go well.

The game has plenty of tension, especially for the US player. While the Jihadists plot and spread, the US tries to minimize the damage - while trying to find the time to achieve its own objectives.

3/20/2011 -- This game makes, what is in my opinion, a misguided assessment about how the "War on Terror" might be won by the United States, not least of which is that a war on "terror" ("terrorism being a word that is arguably definable as a war tactic, and therefore not something on which war cannot possibly be waged at all) can even be won in the first place. Since the USA's "War on Terror" has not yet been concluded, any assessment of how it can be won is purely a matter of conjecture most likely colored by the personal political beliefs of the designer, and, unfortunately, I don't agree with the beliefs to which he appears to subscribe.  So, while I admire Mr. Ruhnke for creating a game on the cutting edge of current world-events, and for creating a system of sound game mechanisms comprising the game's overall set of rules, I cannot enjoy actually playing the game because I do not believe in the objectives set forth for attaining victory.  It's the first time in all of gamedom I've ever been beset by this problem, and it's an interesting one, but ultimately one that lead my copy of Labyrinth to the for-trade pile.  Oh well.

Modular board, "racing" game, simple to play, but challenging, works very well for 2-3 players (plays up to 4 players, but starts to get a bit too chaotic).  I personally love this game, even if everyone else I play with (other than my dad, who also loves it) seems to hate it.  One of the few games I've found that is susceptible to analysis-paralysis.

RATING: 4
This is certainly a game with a unique and functional game mechanic but played by an adult it seems obvious that the scoring system is lame and tends to drag on.  I am not sure how it could be done better but it feels tedious especially if targeting younger gamers.  It was mentioned that not knowing eachothers objectives in the original amazing labyrinth increased the game-flow.  This is probably part of it as tug of war ensues when you know eachothers objectives.  I can see this game working where if alternate turns the maze would change randomly and a monster would attack you if it could.  That would certainly add some flavor to the bland gameplay.  Only an imaginative variation could save this for me.  But given the mechanics in place, that is certainly doable.

An extremely well-themed abstract strategy game, and much superior to its predecessor,Amazing Labyrinth. Any drawbacks? Two: very frequent analysis paralysis; and (with three or four players) it is very difficult to plan a long term strategy. With two players, however, this is not an issue.

Each time that I play this game, I cannot help but think about the moving staircases in the Harry Potter books.  In fact, I would not be surprised to learn that this game provided J.K. Rowling with the inspriation for those mischievous banisters.

The game itself has a magical theme, which is appropriate: I get mesmerized watching the board transform.  Old passages disappear, and new ones materialize in front of my eyes.  The game includes a "wrapping" mechanism: if, by inserting a new maze tile, you push a player's piece or ingredient token off of the board, then that item is placed at the other side of the row, on top of the tile that you just placed.  This simple idea results in very interesting scoring and opponent-prevention opportunities.

[i]Master Labyrinth[/i] has the trappings of a confrontational game, but unless you are thinking several possible moves ahead, your opponents may just be able to turn your own spite against you.  It's an amazing game (go ahead, give me your obligatory groan), and one that works well with the family.

RATING: 6
One of the first non-mainstream games I read about, I think in Games Magazine, and have always wanted this particular version.  And now I have it.  And it is beautiful.  And it's actually not that much of a brain burner.  I could see this as a good solitaire variant if you keep track of turns or do something funky with the scoring.  This game was one of the first non-traditional games that I really wanted.  It's also got the unique Labyrinth moving maze mechanic.  It may be more or as strategic as the Amazing Labyrinth, but I like the removable tokens and secret goal cards much more.  And the Ravensberger production values are great, as always.

While there is more strategy than the A-MAZE-ing labyrinth, because you know what the current target for every player is, it is not as good for the younger kids because there is more of a take that element to the game.  This game allows for a little more advanced planning because there is less hidden information as there is in the original.  The use of wands for clues or extra turns also makes for more interesting decision making.

This is the 1997 US ravensburger edition

Warning: massively brain burning! DOES NOT PLAY IN 20 MINS ;)

All components present, even the tiny magic wands.
Box in good solid condition, but shows some shelfware reasonable for a 1997 game.

Everything else almost pristine inside box.

RATING: 4
An extremely appealing concept that doesn't play quite as well as you'd hope.  The maze looks great and sliding the tiles around is fun, but the flipside of "the maze changes on you every turn" is "you can't plan ahead."  Every turn stops each player dead to contemplate multiple multi-step scenarios.  The scoring is also wonky and under-tested; the first item might be just as hard to secure as the last item, but one is worth 1 and the other 25!  

Apparently the 2007 reissue goes in a very different direction, ditching the formula cards and adding combat (!?); I would have said to play UP the formula cards, losing the random VPs on the ingredients and focus more on each person having a hand of various sets they're trying to assemble.  Might be worth a try, anyway.

Fun move-through-maze game.  Great with children, but can bog down with adults as you struggle not to hand the game to someone else.  Great to pull out again every once in a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Turns can be long as you try to solve the puzzle of how to get the next token (or two, with a wand), but there's almost no ability to plan ahead (in a 4-player game; maybe it's better with fewer players).  Still, I'm a sucker for maze games.  I'm surprised there aren't a lot of variant rules-- the scoring system seems a little weird (first token is worth 1, last is worth 25?) and we were discussing similarities to 9-ball pool, so maybe it should just be that the winner is the one who gets the 25, as long as he also gets the lowest-numbered token on the same turn?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like this less than the original version because of the way that everyone is hunting for the same items in sequence.  The wands and ingredient cards are neat ideas but the actual mechanic of everyone hunting the same item at the same time is not as interesting as the original version.

More complex and far more enjoyable version of [gameid=1219].  It's superiority is a result of point-scoring, magic wands (extra turn), trading, and the competition to get the right ingredients for your secret potion.  
Variant suggested by Joshua Miller: Players are allowed to grab the lowest-numbered or the second-lowest-numbered ingredient (if the lowest is less than a quarter of the second-lowest, they get a free turn after getting the lowest).

Also owned: [gameid=1219] = simplified version for families

I hope Labyrinth is a bit lighter than this, because this one injured my thinking processes. Plus the game has a major flaw by making every successive token of increasing value, it makes it too easy to win if you get lucky with 3 or 4 in a row near the end. A lighter version of this would be a lot of fun though.

The shifting gameboard is nice, but the game took much longer than I like because it is very easy to counteract your opponents move and mess up his track.  So, back and forth you are messing each other up.  Gets a little old.  A nice twist are the 3 secret tokens you need to collect, which give you extra points.

A neat little maze game with an ever changing layout-never the same game twice!  The nature of having to shift the maze each turn can leave some player with analysis paralysis which lead to me knocking a point off the rating.  A fun game for all ages-but you may need to prod some players to "hurry up!" which can lead to making the game drag.

RATING: 5
Played it as child. The main mechanic of moving around labyrinth is good, but the execution of it is just not fun. Prone to AP and not the good kind (when the decision you finally make feels satisfying), the "collect ingredients in order" rule makes for a "block your opponent instead of doing anything useful"-fest and makes no sense thematically.

It's just meh.

I like very much the mechanism of a dynamically changing maze. I played the simpler version as a kid, and this new installment is challenging enough for adults.

A satisfactory game.  I like the "screw-you" factor that comes from shifting the maze around and trying to muddy up your opponents' plans.  However, it sometimes comes to bite you in the end.  I think the artwork is fantastic - simply a lost art form of board game illustration. But this game is a spatial exercise, pure and simple, and sometimes there's nothing you can do to get screwed out of points while your opponent racks them up. Also, this game is terrible with more than 2 players as the chaotic labyrinth loses are semblance of control.

The master labyrinth although adopting the main mechanic from the original in the maze series (amazing labyrinth) makes enough changes where it is a stand alone, and actually forces players to be much more interactive and aware of the other people at the table.  By making simple adjustments to the find and claim rules of the original, Master labyrinth becomes a much more heady game.  I love this series of games, and each have their merits - This is definetly the gamer's choice.

I find the idea of changing the maze by sliding pieces very attractive. However, I don't like the game that's pasted on it, I find it too simple: go to the next goal. So it's just a race to the one next goal, and trying to block your opponents. Not sure how it could be made more interesting to me...

My husband and I enjoyed playing Master Labyrinth. With just two players, we found lots of opportunities to mess up each other's plans, but often the actions we took to thwart the other ended up helping instead. We think that mechanism for moving the tiles in the labyrinth is brilliant, but we found that we needed to place a marker to remind us where the last tile was pushed out. The only problem is that we are both prone to over-analyze our options, so our turns can take too long. But we stay involved in the other's turn because the rules reward good suggestions. 

We have owned this game for nearly 20 years, and it still compares favorably with newer games.

Found this for $5 at an antiques store.  Great Find.  Finally tried this and I have to say I am impressed.  I wasn't expecting much out of this and definately got more then I paid for.  The amount of thinking and strategy in this one is excellent.  It reminds me of Chess when playing two players as you are always trying to think 2 to 3 moves ahead and trying to predict what your oponent will do.  The one differences though is that if your oponent makes an unexpected move it can throw off all of your planning.

RATING: 6
The game as written rates about a 5 out of 10, marginally better (for adults) than Amazing Labyrinth.  Played with gamers, something is a little bit out of whack; the game is too prone to stalemates and defensive play.  For a much better, more dynamic game, make the following simple change.  Players are allowed to grab the lowest-numbered remaining ingredient or the second-lowest remaining ingredient.  Having two options makes the decisions more interesting and speeds the game along nicely.  With my variant rule, sometimes a low number like the 1 or the 2 gets left behind, and players are afraid to take that token and open up more opportunities for their opponents.  Consequently, I also allow a player to take a second turn if the lowest remaining ingredient on the board (after grabbing an ingredient) is at least four times the value of the token grabbed.  With these changes, Master Labyrinth makes a very nice two-player game, sort of like a brainburning version of Kupferkessel Co.  It's not as good with three, and you should definitely play something else with a group of four.

A "more advanced" version of AMAZEing Labyrinth, this one adds a little more strategic depth. Instead of just randomly pursuing whatever item comes next in your pile, in this one you can actually plan out your moves. You can get bonus points for certain items, use wands for extra moves, and negotiate deals to help other players. Plus, it generally plays quickly.

This game is not for everyone.  I'd argue that it's for few.  This game might have inspired Ricochet Robots, except it has a board you modulate as you play, instead of before you play and players move their pawns individually instead of collectively trying to move the same pawn.  Unfortunately, those mechanics just aren't as strong and will ensure that if I want to play a puzzle game, this one won't be the one that gets to the table.  Better than original Labyrinth though.

Probably the best version of Labyrinth I've played, with a lot more strategy on 'safetys' than in the normal game, not to mention the addition of scaled points depending on your special ingredients, which others may share.

RATING: 7
Best with 2, 3 players

Ebay purchase. 
Improves on the previous versions by making it competitive, specially if two or more are seeking the same ingredients.
Also, the mechanic of increasing the value of the ingredients as the game goes on gives those who did not get ingredients in the beginning a chance to  get points as the game goes on: thus no early decided winners.
Other thrift purchases have been sold, or traded.

RATING: 6
A very deep game similiar to both Chess and Dungeon Twister in the style of play, I prefer both of those to this though. Very prone to AP and quite hard to visualize the potential paths at times, some turns can be taken quickly but then you really are not considering all the ramifications of your action and your not planning ahead. The secret mission card ensures tension and a little intrigue, magic wands are almost too powerful giving you an extra turn whenever you want but it can really help you complete your mission. 

There can be some back and forth as there are two ways to play, offensively collecting the goals or defending against your opponent collecting them which can drag it out a bit too long. On this topic Glamourous Mucus has an interesting variant posted in his comment letting you collect the lowest OR second lowest goal to fix the back and forth and length problem, I would like to try this and think it would speed up play a bit and make it easier ergo the wands should probably be taken out at this point. Probably only good with 2 players although 3 could possible pass albeit you will lose all control over the board and your ability to plan along with it changing the game to something more tactical really defeating the purpose of this type of game.

I really like the puzzle aspect of this game.  I've been very impressed by my son as he examines the board and finds moves.  He has even planned out two-move combos by using a wand.  I like how this exercises his logic skills.

This game does seem prone to AP problems.

This will never be my favorite game as it is basically an abstract game, but I do like the logic puzzle feel.  I will probably play this more than most games I have rated a 5.

Nice idea, but I seem to remember the scoring was out of whack.

Played it again and had to drop the rating. The scoring indeed feels very arbitrary with three players at least.

I'd try something like this: the first five ingredients are worth 1 point, the next five 2 points, and so on. Add 5 points for any ingredient on your card. Doubling the value of card ingredients would be better in some respects, but then the cards become different in terms of potential payoff.

Ez a játék szerintem megelőzte a korát. 25 év eltelt, de én nem érzem elavultnak. Egy egyszerű, de nagy variációt biztosító társas. Remek szórakozás, ahogyan az útvonalat tervezgetve, a labirintust módosítva versenyeznek egymás ellen a játékosok. Kevesebb fővel jobban tervezhető, négyesben már inkább partijáték. :)
A pontozási rendszer talán lehetne másképpen, és a receptkártyák is elég esetlegesek, de pl. arra jók, hogy az egy pontot érő korongért is elinduljon az ember, mert végül egészen sok pluszpontot hozhat.

My mom loves this game! She's always asking me to bring it over, or she wants to play when she visits. What I really like about this game is: it's only as complicated as you make it. I've had friends sit there for an hour pondering their next move and everyone else is biting their tongues because they all see the best move to make, or that there is no way he's going to connect a path, or... and so on. Anywho, this is a fun and simple game to learn and play.

This game is a more complicated version of "Das verrückte Labyrinth". It is a slightly more advanced game, which makes it more interesting for adults, but less playable for younger children.

The games looks beautiful with top components (as usual for Ravensburger). I liked the game a lot, but not the scoring. I have lost a 2 player game although I had way more ingredients then the other player, but the other player had more ingredients in the end of the game which are much more valuable. 
You can also play according to the rules of the regular aMAZEing labyrinth. There are 21 potion cards and 21 ingredients, each ingredient is only once displayed at the top of one of the potion cards. Therefore you can use the potion cards just as you use them in the aMAZEing labyrinth and only look at the top ingredient.
update:
The game became one of the favourite quick lighter games for my wife. We play mostly with the regular rules and use sometimes the Master rules to get some variation.

I used to play the aMAZEing Labyrinth as a kid...this one is just as fun.  I like that in this version you know that everyone is trying to get to the same spot, which allows for more defensive maneuvers if you know you won't be able to get there in your current turn.

It isn't often that games structured around mechanical gimmicks or even visual acuity end up being games at all, but ML knocks it out of the park as both by limiting fiddly-ness and establishing good "take that, maybe?" player intereaction.

I played this solo, trying to make the best move with each piece as its turn came up, and was pleasantly surprised. Granted, I haven't played against anyone (and probably won't, as my wife doesn't play games and I'll probably trade or sell this thrift store find). However, the mechanics are simple, the strategies are interesting, and as an experienced gamer I can see how this game should play out. In short, I like it more than I thought I would, and the components are nice. I liked it enough to briefly consider keeping it--but someone made me an offer I couldn't refuse.

Adding a pre-defined order of grabbing tends to slow down the game as each player works hard to ensure the next player can't get it if he can't get it himself.

A fun experience with a unique mechanic. Pushing tiles to change the labyrinth's paths is a lot of fun for me. The unfortunate part is that players will almost always be able to grab the next component and completing the bonus cards is therefore mostly random luck, but the base mechanic of shifting the maze is something I quite like. Wish there was a better game on top of that mechanic, but as is I enjoy this from time to time.

Light fun game with a great theme, even though it is an abstract puzzler. A tad random with four or more players but that can be part of the fun and make it even more accesible for kids.

Interesting race game through a shifting maze.  My problem with the game is that it is far to easy to pick up your next item every turn.  Consequently, it feels far to easy - especially for a "master" version.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

A much better game than A-Maze-Ing Labyrinth.  With all the players going for the common goals, game forces player interaction.  The mix of secret ingredients (worth significant points) adds to a players decisions - go for the next goal or wait for the subsequent one (especially if the payout is higher).  Finally, the ability of a two turns in a row (magic wands) for a quick score adds to game and diminishes the pain of getting one goal, but setting up another player for a nicer one.  Now you might just be able to grab it yourself.

I'm talking about the original 1991 edition here, not the 2007 version.  It's an elegant clever strategy game of moving through a shifting maze to collect numbered tokens in order.  Serious gamers/adults and casual gamers/kids can both enjoy it.

There is a separate BGG entry for the highly revamped 2007 edition which is gussied up with dragons and dice and craziness that we couldn't understand from the German rules, but it was too much chrome, and they should have changed the title if they were going to change the game so much.

This game is right up my alley.  I really enjoy the brain-bending that goes on trying to determin the right move on each turn.  There are two major drawbacks though.  1) People who do not have strong spatial thought processes can have a lot of trouble with this.  My sister is kind of this way.  However, she still had fun playing.  2) It can very easily lead to overanalysis, which can be a real problem with a person from group 1 above as they try to figure out any possible move, let alone the optimal move.  Still, this is a game I like and will play when possible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not a strategy game, as the malestrom of luck-of-the-draw blows plans around as much as the actions of players. 

The enjoyment of the game comes from the discovery of card placement opportunities.

As a young person or beginner's game, it is many times more engaging than something like Memory or Guess Who.

RATING: 6
Fun game that has added value over the original with the extra rule of trying to collect various items in order. This is the Labyrinth to get, surely, but the game does bog down every time as people are always looking for "the great move". Perhaps a timer would be the key?

RATING: 7.5
Such a clever game: players are wizards trying to shift square path tiles in order to gain access to various tokens (numbered 1-20, 25) around the board. These are worth the VPs as marked on the token. The thing is, the tokens have to be picked up in strict ascending order. To add to the mix, players also get a card that lists 3 tokens that give a bonus 20 points if collected. Each wizard also gets 3 magic wands that allow a second turn but are worth 3 points if unused.

Each turn, the active player takes the spare tile and slides it from one of 12 points around the edge of the gameboard. This causes passages to shift and form. They then move along accessible paths. If their wizard pawn stops on a token that can legally be picked up, they will do so.

I like how the corridors twist and turn and how tokens appear and wrap around the board. There is potential to plan moves ahead and to hinder opponents. The game is more tactical with 4 and more strategic with 2. A time limit of sorts should be imposed when played with people with Analysis Paralysis. It's worth a look as it's simple enough to appeal to both kids and adults. The artwork evokes the theme of the game well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Great concept and the added depth helps the game a lot. However, there is something that makes this a tad tedious. I think it might be the fact that the pieces must be picked up in the exact order of their numbers, thus adding the problem of all players going after the same piece and the need to time exactly so that one can get the piece oneself (on the next turn) but no one else can. That makes for a perfect case of analysis paralysis problem. Also, spatial imagination is very important (which does not bother me, but kills the game for some people.)

I always preferred the original. Mechanically mostly the same yet with a stronger theme I never warmed up to the use of the magic wands in this version which give you an extra turn. It made the game too easy (and not more complex as most people claim it is). I understand that the theme might be more appealing to older players but the wands really ruined it for me. I liked the idea of collecting ingredients for your potion, though. Maybe I was nut-picky in this case but once we owned both I still preferred to pull out the classic.

Brainburn-y update to the classic Labyrinth. There are treasures numbered 1-25 to collect, each worth that number of points, and players are also each after three specific treasures worth +20 to face value. Only the lowest numbered tile can be collected at any given time, so players are competing for resources.

Much as I don't usually like rules tweaks, I'm inclined to think that some of the variants suggested here work better in terms of adding decisions (e.g., can collect either the lowest or second-lowest tile). In practice, long term strategy seems essentially impossible, or at least beyond mere humans like me.

The result is a sort of pleasantly puzzly but ultimately pointless. Much better than the original game, however.

RATING: 6
[Disney HK 2005 edition] {Disney; puzzle, tile-laying; optimal 2p} Labyrinth is a nice family game. It is especially good for a mixed group of adults and children.  It is a good game to train the pattern matching, logical thinking and concentration of the children. The cute and friendly cartoon figures make it more interesting and welcome by children.

It's a tactical game - a player can hardly plan their path because one can't predict the next destination. Yet, ML is only slightly luck dependent; wise moves of tiles and pawn are more important for winning.  It seems 2p game is more tactical. 4p game is more chaotic because the location of tiles always changes but it is more fun.

Sequel to the Amazing Labyrinth, not nearly as fun.  Everyone runs for the same ingredient at the same time, so you constantly need to change your path as others get the ingredients first.  Too heavily weighted to the endgame as the last ingredients are worth more.

Its a puzzle game. Don't let this one and the number of Labyrinth games out there fool you - this is an adult level game that takes a decent amount of spatial reasoning ability to do well at. There is a lot to try and see and its one of those games you either get or you don't and will like or hate. I enjoy this type of game and the shifting board is interesting.

Lovely elaboration on the original Amazing Labyrinth. The only problem is that by the time the kids are old enough to play this now difficult to find version of the game, they'll be ready for more complicated fare. Still, worth playing if you have a mixed crowd of young and older game players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is much more of a brain-burner than the rules alone made me believe (at least at two-player).  The combination of envisioning the effect of sliding the maze, trying to prevent the opponent from getting the next ingredient, hidden "home" ingredients for each player that may overlap, the wands that allow extra turns, and trying to set yourself up for future ingredients makes for a deep and engaging game.

Master Labyrinth is the most gamer-y of a series that was admittedly designed for children.  The result is thoroughly adult-friendly and frankly, very challenging for those without strong spatial skills.  Master Labyrinth is an excellent all-purpose gateway game.

I have owned this game for many many years, and I still think it's a fun game. The shifting tiles gives the game a puzzle-like feel, and it's easy for kids and non-gamers to learn and play. My primary gripe with the game is that you can't really plan any overarching strategy; you can plan how to get the current compenent and maybe the next one, but the shifting passages make any longer planning impossible. I think it would be fun to have something additional to do besides shift and move.

This one has a different feel from The aMAZEing Labyrinth since you are all racing to get the same tiles (in numerical order) instead of just getting the needed ingredients from a hidden hand of ingredient cards.  This makes things a bit more challenging and leaves plenty of opportunities to mess with opponents since everyone is going after the same thing.

Players are wizards in an ever-changing maze, trying to collect the most points to win.  The basic, unique concept of this game is a board that includes some moveable maze tiles.  Every turn, players slide a row of the moveable tiles.  The constantly shifting maze is frustrating and fun - do you block your opponents or open up your own path?  Good for families, easy to learn, and always new and different each time you play.

The biggest detriment to this game is playing it with someone deliberate or slow.  Employ a timer to limit people's turns, and you are set.  The challenges of the shifting labyrinth and trying to synchronize your turns with the ingredients on your recipe (which provide a heavy bonus) make this a very fun game, provided you play with respectful turn lengths.  I rather enjoy the provision of the lore behind each item, as well.  We rarely play without reading those aloud as we go for a new item.

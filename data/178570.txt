I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I find the idea behind Unusual Suspects to be pretty clever and surely fresh, although it also makes it a game that needs to be played with the right group. 

As far as mechanisms are concerned Unusual Suspects borrows ideas from other games like Mysterium and Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, but manages to present them with a pretty nice twist. The game flow is very smooth, there's not a lot of downtime - surely less than a similar game like Codenames - and it's also able to bring some laughter to the table. Furthermore the artwork on the card is very nice and there's enough of them in the box to guarantee a good re-play value.

All these qualities make Unusual Suspect a good party game experience, even if you should be aware not to fall into sexism or racism... even if the game is still not as bad as Cards Against Humanity. I would compare it a lot to Codenames for the general feel that the game gives me, but I like it much better than Codenames, because there's less downtime and more laughing here... not to mention the fact that here you can look at artwork instead of words printed on cards.

All that being said, my rating will seem pretty low considering the positive statements above, but that's just because party games aren't really my thing. This one is actually one of the best I've ever played and one that I rank quite highly compared to the others.

I'm very torn with this game and how I feel about how I should rate it.

On one hand, it is a quick light game that gets people to work together and determine who the true suspect is based on a true/false answer to some questions.

However, it bothers me that this game could win the award of "boardgame most likely to inflame and/or reinforce racist/classist/gender/ageist stereotypes" of all kinds.  Some of the comments I got from my group are "those women would never play video games", "that guy (Latino male with diamond earrings) is totally a thug and would never go to the opera", or the woman in the sari and with the bindi on her forehead definitely does yoga!".  As one other commenter noted, this game could otherwise be renamed "Prejudice and racism: The game"

Guess Who is really about objective items like glasses, women, men, etc, and there isn't any judgement calls which puts it into "safe" territory.  This really brings it into the danger zone IMHO and as a result I have to rate it much lower.

RATING: 7.5
This is a difficult game to quantify by normal 'gaming' standards primarily because I believe it may have been designed with the intent to evoke a response, and through that response, teach. 

As game mechanics go, it's a light Code Names/A2A mash up. As a social interaction, it's much more daring ("safe space" alert). Bombs and death from above are fine when themes align with socially acceptable memes . . .  but when confronted with a truly personal stake in societal interactions, it's safer to retreat into  "that's offensive" rather than to confront reality.   
Some people just aren't honest enough to accept the double standards of their (our) paradigm(s). Some people just aren't brave enough  for this game.  Are you?

This is a light a fun party game, unluckily released in the same timeframe of Codenames. The cooperative nature, and the arbitrary (tough funny) questions, relegate this at an inferior position than Vlaada's masterpiece.

"Wie is het?" maar dan met wat extra's.

12 hoofdjes worden klaargelegd en de spelleider weet wie de dader is.  Hij moet vragen op kaartjes beantwoorden met JA of NEEN, louter afgaand op het uiterlijk.
Hier word je geconfronteerd met je vooroordelen!?

De groep moet proberen te raden wie van de 12 het gedaan heeft door één voor één hoofdjes om te draaien, die het niet zijn.

Coöperatief, maar dan goed!

RATING: 7
I wasn't expecting much from this game, but it provides an easy-going and fun co-op in about 10-15 min. In this game, one person knows the guilty suspect, but can only help the others pick out which it is based on answering profiling-type questions from cards with a straight-faced yes or no answer. The catch is that at least one suspect must be eliminated every round, so as you near the end, differentiating which person "doesn't have a smartphone" can be tricky.

This one surprised me and I will be bringing it out more often. This is a party game that is simple enough for anybody. My only disclaimer is that unlike most party games, this one probably wouldn't make for a good ice-breaker, as the profiling nature is probably best kept among those who already know each other.

RATING: 7
A fun activity that sheds some light on how we make first impressions based on peoples' appearances. Each round, a characteristic will come up, like "reads novels", and the witness player declares whether the suspect reads novels or not. The other players then eliminate suspects from a tableau of 12 suspects purely on the suspects' visual appearance of whether they read novels or not.

There's technically a scoring system, but I can't see it ever really mattering, other than encouraging people to eliminate more suspects early.

I can see this game being offensive to some people due to the stereotyping that is required to play, but I at least think it tackles the issue in an interesting way.

Stupid game that's valid for what it is.
I don't dislike it.. in fact.. i fairly like it but it's all a matter of having fun at drawn faces and all. As a game.. it ends up there. Can be fun at parties, most likely with a bit of light head.
Someone could be finding offending but... i personally enjoy it.
The only thing missing is the lack guesses limitation. Having only the points (Hanabi style) to see how well you've done, doesn't cut it

New worst game I've ever played. Truly awful. The back of the box frames the game as provoking discussion on stereotypes, but the mechanics of the game rely on stereotypes and force the players to use them in order to be successful. So, let's not judge a book by a cover, right everyone, but lets make money publishing games promoting hilarious stereotypes about minorities that are best triggering and at worst inciteful. Hypocrisy at its finest.

RATING: 6
As much a Rorschach test as a game. Whether that's fun or a disaster will depend on the group you play it with. Don't take this one to that boardgame Meetup.

It's a coop game. Lay out a grid of cartoonish headshots. You secretly pick one picture as the one you want to be last man/woman standing. Then the other players ask questions from cards they draw (not their own questions). [i]Does this person gamble?[/i] You reply with a simple yes or no and then the other players decide which one(s) they want to eliminate from consideration. Repeat over several rounds and hopefully your guy/gal is the one left standing.

It was pretty funny to hear how we all projected onto these drawings. Basically an exercise in profiling. One friend locked onto a chubby, older woman and claimed she definitely "carried a gun/gambled/went clubbing" whereas she looked quite the opposite to the rest of us. Whether or not that says more about him or us is debatable I guess, but if that sounds fun to you (it does to me), then this is your game. Just be careful whom you play it with because your own subconscious prejudices may slip out.

Light hearted deduction game where the witness is trying to clue everyone else in onto the suspect.

Kind of like "guess who" style except you don't get to pick what to question to ask, it's random from a deck and the witness gets to answer

A lot characters could look similar or fit the profile, so it's fun to stretch out why you think this person does or doesn't like/do/is something.

If you're someone obsessed with PC culture, do not play this game.  Then again, you probably should play this game, as it brings out among players beliefs they may not even know they have.

RATING: 3
I am sorry to say that I didn't really get this. Don't get me wrong, I think the main mechanic is brilliant.... but to me it fails at the same time Why?

Because when you state a yes and no question there is a huge possibility that every character that you have left would say the same thing and then it's just a random pick of the cards. Ok, you can state the previous questions can weigh in but personally I think that it doesn't really work. A lot of the questions are simply hard to just answer yes and no to.

I would like to try a variant where I get a question like:
How many of the other characters pay more tax then you? That way I need to try and rank the characters and give some sort of information.

I realize that it would detract from the theme that it's an interrogation where you ask one person questions but it would improve the "game".

On the surface this a simple cooperative game of associatiion where one player is giving clues and other players are guessing based on that clues. 

Beneath however, lurks something far more sinister: we're forced to judge (fictive) people just by their looks and this shows us a lot about or prejudices and about or the way humans generally judge each other. This is more than just a game, it is a hidden social experiment.

This one is not really for me. Basically cooperative Guess Who with no room for creative questions, since you simply have to ask whatever the card you draw says. Additionally, it's generally trivial to simply "win", and so it essentially requires playing a few times in a row and trying for your score. Not very appealing to me. Even the humor of politically incorrect stereotyping didn't really seem to show up much in the games we played.

There are very serious racist/class-ist/sexist undertones in this game and it encourages people to be racist/class-ist/sexist in a way that other games do not. If I give the publisher the benefit of the doubt and say they're simply ignorant that would be generous. I really expect more of our community. CAH promotes hateful speech, but in a randomized way that makes players more focused on getting a laugh then promoting harmful stereotypes. While this game is not funny and wants you to make judgement on wealth, skin color, gender because that's all you have to go on! If you played this game with a 13 year old you would literally be reinforcing racism into their decision making. There are better games, with better themes, and better mechanics.

The comparisons to [i]Guess Who[/i] are superficial -- this is more social psychology experiment than game. Faidutti's blog showed a homebrew version with famous people, which strikes me as potentially more interesting, because there one might speculate based on known traits instead of pure stereotype.

This is basically adult Guess Who.

It won't be a game you pull out with just anybody or would even want to play that often.  Perfect for occasional play - maybe get 5 or so plays at one time and then not pull it out again for several months.  If you always play with the same group of people, I could see this getting stale even quicker.

May look into just free forming our own questions in the future or playing with a hand of cards to pick the questions from.

Guess Who meets profiling!  Yes, there might be a little bit of uncomfortableness with how one has to answer some of the questions, but a fun light game.  The team vs. team version played best giving things a bit of a Codenames-feel.

This game is premised on stereotypes, and it will expose them among the players. One player has to "identify" faces/people pictured by saying "yes" or "no" to questions like, "Did this person go to college?" Know the set up going in, and agree to accept and "play" according to that premise. Otherwise, things could get tense and ugly. In the right frame of mind, a fun game. Not great, but good.

RATING: 6
Fast easy party game, guaranteeing lots of laughs (because of wrong choices, silly questions and joking around). Feels a bit like Spyfall, but the cooperative / group think element in this game makes me enjoy it more. The big downside to the game is that it promotes stereotypes and a little racism. This is of course inherent to the game, but it's reinforced by the choice of suspects and the artwork on the cards. I think this can undermine the fun feel of the game ... but, if you like games like Cards Against Humanity this wouldn't be any different.

Could easily have been called "Stereotypes: The Game". Or "Racism: The Game", depending on with whom you play.

Unusual Suspects requires players to judge characters based on their appearance. No doubt, this will make people uncomfortable.

For me, I like creating stories about the suspects. The witness can use those stories to guide how they answer future questions about the line up.

A decent amount of plays with a party of 6...with pretty good feedback. Similar to "Say Anything" where it helps to have some personal knowledge of the player assuming the  "detective" role. Like most party games, the fun-factor is fairly dependent on the interaction of the group. For longer play-ability you're going to need the expansion to keep this game from becoming stale.

RATING: 7
This is a very interesting party game.  The game works a lot like Guess Who but with more subjective questions.  There is a 4x3 row of portraits of characters, one player knows who the target character is and the other players take turns asking questions trying to eliminate all options but the target character in the fewest number of rounds.  The twist is that instead of objective questions like "does the character have black hair?" they are very subjective like "does the character play a musical instrument?"

As you can imagine, you need to be very comfortable with both the people you play this game with and things like judgement, stereotypes, etc.  This game could hurt a lot of feelings otherwise.  It's dangerous.

But if you are the kind of person who can find entertainment in something like that it's pretty fun and definitely original (probably because of the potential pitfalls of this kind of game).

The art is also very good, especially for this game.  Very exaggerated portraits, almost like caricatures.

tl;dr: [thing=39856][/thing] meats [thing=4143][/thing], really!

Yep, you have cards, and you answer yes or no questions that are always completely subjective. This should help your team mates to figure out the suspect by process of elimination, just like in Guess Who?
It's kind of funny what questions you have to answer. Like "Does this person own a turntable or not" which obviously is something that is not immediately obvious from looking at drawings of faces. So some discussion ensues. And that can be fun for a bit, but I would suggest Codenames or Dixit in stead.

This is a light and silly game, it's like if you want to play Codenames but with very little pressure to come up with anything.  The whole game is the social dynamic of judging people based on looks, and trying to get inside the head of the investigator.  The game is good fun, not something I'd  yearn to play, but something that's fun to pass the time and super easy to teach and play while being good for a few laughs.

I have being following the evolution of this game from the start and I am very happy with the final outcome. Unusual Suspects is now a game that manages to explore and reveal the inner social feelings and perspectives of the people taking part to it. It really ignites loud and fun discussion around the table and this is a really big merit. Wonderful if you want to know who your game mates really are and what they think of people.
I was quite suspicious about the use of drawings instead of REAL photo of REAL people but i must admit that in the end the art is very nice and it preserves the original intent of the game (even if I still do think that real people would have been better)

There's nothing better than having someone surprise you in such a way that they force you to confront your biased expectations.  Unusual Suspects is the opposite of that.

I was trying to guess who would find this game's premise acceptable, but then I realized that was *also* racial, gender, and geographic stereotyping.  Suckered into a social justice feedback loop!

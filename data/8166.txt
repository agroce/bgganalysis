A base of settlers with a mix of Entdecker and a dash of Puerto Rico. I like the fact that you can choose to adopt one of several strategies and try a different approach next game. Very low on interaction and effectively a race to implement your strategy before the others, nevertheless, it is very well balanced across the strategies and represents an excellent hours gaming.

This game boils down to "get the shipyard (early), win the game". My gaming partner knew this from playing before, I suspected as much when playing for the first time. She got the tile. I tried to make up for this by taking all the public buildings that give trading boni, but it didn't work out: She got the bath house. Two of the worst points of the game have shown right then:

1. Not only does one manage to get more boni by building the fourth public building first, this also secures a winning condition for him that the other players can't get anymore. With Settlers (the card game), there's one of the people who can get one village more than the other, who will get more resources faster that way, but the other player can still balance that. Here this advantage also is a winning condition, which exempts the other players from winning that way. That's crazy! 

2. The same applies to having the majority of the ports or trade agreements, which makes an already powerful Shipyard all the more powerful, you're faster with that.

3. When you combine the trade agreements and the public buildings, you can manage to sell resources for more than it costs you to buy them, the easiest with the Bath House which nets 6 gold while costing as low as 3 gold with 3 trade agreements. So you'll be able to generate 3-9 gold out of thin air when it's your turn, you don't even need to have ports to really produce the tobacco.

These points make the game very unbalanced and unfair, I wonder how this passed a critical testing. When we noticed the third point, we decided to abandon the game.

Don't know if this is any different with more than two players, as there are two shipyards then, but with two it's just broken. You can just have a race for the Shipyard and call it quits then - "good game". :P

Reminiscent of Settlers, but with no trading, and with a bit of an exploration aspect. Also, everyone just builds on their own private board. The exploration is nice, but I'd like it a lot more if it had more ways to interact with other players.

Decent [b]Settlers[/b] derivative.  I liked all of the elements, but it just seemed...long.  It also seemed like some trading of goods would help the game (can't believe I'm saying this--I hate trading!).  Takes a long time to get moving, but I like how you have a good feeling of progression.

RATING: 9
This is basically Settlers with less luck due to the more even resource income system.  The mapboard struggle is replaced by interaction on the sea board, which gives a more balanced game because one is not permanently screwed just because his opponent has beaten him to a key building site.  There is also direct interaction through the large branch office, which is a milder version of the robber.  (So, any claims that the game lacks interaction are plain wrong.)  Interesting mix of victory conditions where one needs to adjust his strategy according to what he finds in the seas.  A very good game; the low ratings are to be distrusted!

{1 play • 4 players} Hmm... not sure if my rating will rise or drop after another play.  There is some interaction despite many claims otherwise, but not a lot.  That would be okay, if it were a more controllable "solitaire race."  But with moderately reasonable play by everyone, I worry that the whole thing comes down to who gets lucky and/or who gets screwed.  Early in our game, Fire flukely came twice in a row - rolled by players A & B - which ended up nailing Player C, who was, at that point, out of it with seemingly no way to come back.  Near the end of the game, one player spent 3 full ship turns (4 movement) unable to find the tile that would give him a VP... and there were 4 of them still left out there (out of about 8).  I'm not saying there's no strategy, but I feel like it's basic strategy - regardless of your choices, it all kind of evens out - so it ultimately felt like it came down to what did or didn't just fall into your lap.

4 plays.  The race aspect of the game forces players to keep a close watch on what other players are doing.  Resource system is more forgiving than Settlers.  Good non-confrontational game of city building, resource mgt. & exploration.  Basically, I don't believe that there is a lack of player interaction... there's plenty of thought that goes into trying to edge out other players for public buildings and guessing which exploration tiles a person has left behind.

Just got this game and love it.  It is easy to learn - especially if you have experienced playing Settlers of Catan.  There are several good strategy options in this game and the game board presentation is very good and appealling to look at.  Each individual island adds alot to the game and makes it easy to play on smaller surfaces.  Typical Klauss Teuber - this guys just doesn't seem to be able to strike out.  I have played it 2-player and 4-player and it is great both ways.  This is one of my favorites for sure.

Quite simple and easy to learn. You can choose a few different tactics which gives an interesting game. You do not actually fight your opponents - it is more a game of doing better than them. For this reason it works equally well with two or more players. I think a few possibilities of making life hard for your opponents would have been nice. A quite good and relatively short game.

One play. I wasn't too impressed. The ship movement/exploration seemed somewhat disconnected and mostly unproductive, as one player did not play ships much but did well.

A game by the same designer as Settlers of Catan with some similar mechanics. It still plays out very differently and has a nice naval "exploration" aspect to it that Settlers doesn't have.

The ressource draw is also more forgiving: you receive at least one ressource every time you roll the dice.

A nice game from Klaus along the lines of Settlers crossed with Entdecker. Explore islands and build up your home island with trade routes and agreements and settle the new land.

Given the reaction to this game by my Geekbuddies I went in expecting a disaster, but ended up being pleasantly surprised. This is essentially Siedler with some more gamey options added onto it and a slightly longer playtime. Gone are the light-hearted trading mechanisms, but added on are significant new choices in regards to different strategies (trading posts? island outposts? which special buildings?) and the game seems like it should have some legs on that basis. Luck is significant in that the islands you turn over are pivotol to your initial strategy, and, like Settlers, getting a run of your favoured number, in this case your "1 of anything" number, can throw the game in your favour, but there are also many ways to mitigate this. Need something from the ocean? Buy the upgrade that allows your ships to move faster. Need a particular good? Sell off your others and purchase it from the bank. I do not think this would be an appropriate game to nail heavily as a serious game group, but I would certainly consider it a great way to have fun with casual gamers when you want something with a slightly higher investment than Settlers that plays in about the same amount of time. One caveat, low levels of player interaction. There is only one building that allows direct interaction between the players (the pay 2, and steal one card one) and even that is generally only used in the mid to late game when the owner is trying to thwart a win. Overall another solid, middle of the road game by Teuber that is a good cross-over choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Yet another very good game waylaid by poor reviews from a few Eurogamer chin-strokers.  The mixed reviews are ludicrous, this is a typically excellent game from Teuber and anyone who appreciates anything he's done since Settlers will likely find much enjoyment in this medium-weight exploration and development game.  No, there isn't much interaction...but only marginally less than Goa or Princes of Florence because there's no auction.  So what.  True, the mechanics are rehashes from Settlers and Entdecker but I'd bet that most of the people rating this under a 5 wouldn't take Knizia to task for using the same five mechanics over and over again.

RATING: 7.5
Had to think about whether to give this a 8 or a 7. The game is easy to learn. I liked the concept of having to fulfill any 3 out of 5 victory conditions to win. This adds a nice element of strategy to the game. The luck is very balanced. The only knock on the game is some of the buildings seem out of balance. In particular the buildings which double the speed of your ships seems much better than other cards. The production system is similar to settlers but as I said more balanced. On any roll from 1 to 5 all players will get something albeit something different. A 6 leads to a random event which everyone also participates in. You only use one die so you can't complain that someone else is getting all their numbers. This game has a lot of good elements going for it.

Components: Well-made components and nicely designed graphics (from the computer version?).

Experience: Mostly laid back, collecting my commodities and investing them as I see fit, with only a few ways to influence other players. Even though players are almost guaranteed to get production on each roll of the die, there still seems to be a large disparity between the usability of the resources different players are getting.

I like that there are different victory conditions, but some are so bound up with specific advancements that missing the advancement almost precludes achieving the victory (e.g. without protection from pirates, it can be very costly to maintain four factories and three trade agreements).

Solid Teuber game that feels like several of his other games tossed together.  Players develop their player mats and try to be the first to achieve three of five possible victory conditions.  A die is rolled that produces goods for everybody, the phasing player buys/sells/builds, then sails a ship in Entdecker fashion to attempt to find valuable stuff (for them).  A tight resource management game where most of the player interaction is in racing for the rapidly diminishing goal tiles (there isn't enough for everybody).  Nice game, although the graphics are a bit muddy.

If this game was shorter, I'd play it more.  I enjoy the exploration theme here, as you use boats to discover advantages in terms of supplies and such.  There's still a die that must be rolled for goods, however, and that can hose you fairly well.  I'm actually glad that there's no trading in the game, as it would be slowed down even more if there was.

I sat watching my german friends play this. They really liked it, I didn't. It's just Settlers crashed into Entdecker. The game is from a PC game with the same graphics, and the gameplay is just like a PC game in that the players have NO interaction. You roll the die at your turn start, everybody collects resources, you trade ONLY to the bank, develope your settlement on your mat, move a ship through islands in a channel to collect bonus tiles. Players work to 3/4 victory conditions, but everything you do is self-contained, and you might as well play by yourself.

This one is interesting. A game from 2003, and the production reflects the time. Whilst it might have been good for its time, the font size on the cards and the tiles are very small. Most at the table needed to get their glasses. As a game, Im still undecided. I like the concept; not over-complex rules, little boards in front of each player, different winning conditions, and yet it seems a little flat. Plus, the double speed boat power seems to be too powerful. Its one of those games where someone gets an unfair advantage in the first quarter of the game, and the rest is watching them use that skill to win the game. And yet, other reviews suggest, the boat strategy can be bettered with resource management buying and selling. So, at the moment, I m going to keep it purely if I could see if I can win this game without using the boat stategy. So, rating is 6.362, Dec 2015) UPDATE; Would rather play a new game than try and save an old game. Gone (Rating: 4.827, Jan 17)

That's how The Settlers of Catan without trading element would look like. Dice rolling, resource collecting, building, upgrading etc. Plays well and nothing more. And when you played Anno 1503 you can tell that trading in Catan is indeed something extraordinary - it makes the game. Without it - zero fun, zero emotions, zero anything. Just dice rolling and some (not very agonizing) decisions.

RATING: 7
Settlers minus direct trading plus exploration... sort of.  I rather like it, but I understand why other might not.  Some familiarity with the computer game helps make sense of the building order, but it is not necessary.  The expansion is a big plus, but I tweak the victory conditions to reduce the need for pirate hunting.

RATING: 6
This is one of those games that to me seems a little underrated.  It has a really nice blend of mechanics and multiple victory conditions, it has some luck, but there still good choices to be made.  Player interaction is not high, but it's basically a race anyway and you can actively take things that others may want.  The graphics are fine and colorful and perfectly functional.  Buildings are computery, but they are nicely done and have plenty of detail.  Good game.

RATING: 8
This was a nice surprise. With 3 of 5 different goals to reach, you can adapt your strategy to your luck of draws. The rules are simple, although deep enough to make me like the game and the theme works very well.
Although the interaction is less than in Settlers, as you have no trading phase, the game is so involving and quick, so this doesn&#039;t really matter. You still have interaction in that way that it is a race to certain buildings and discovery tokens on the main board, so you can still be mean to each other. The economy management is very important in the game, not least to foresee the possibility to avoid catastrophes.
The different way of goals make the feel of the game to be different between different game (=good replayability).

Stolen love to replace my copy.  :(

Update:  Bought a reasonable priced replacement.  This is one of the few games my wife actually requests to play.  I like the building up of your own island.  She likes that you don't directly interfere with each others placements, like in Settlers.  You still interact, racing with ships, but it's not as direct.

The game that introduced me to the gaming world. 

Great game for starters and for those with some experience behind their back. It's sort of like settlers but with a twist of Endtecker. Very fun game. 

The thing that makes it tense is that you have 5 goals to fulfill and you need to fill 3 of them. Any 3. But it's not as easy as it sounds. 

Colorful game with nice graphics and not taking too much space. I fell in love with it and from that day I new that I was hooked on this new style of games.

I recommend this game whole heartedly.

With my dad in mind, I picked up the Kosmos edition of this at an auction for £12. Dad was more than happy to get a new game, especially one by Settlers designer Klaus Teuber. Dad was so keen to give it a try that the very next day, even though it was mother's day, we set it up and waded through the translation of the rules.

RATING: 6.5
It's a solid design, but the game does not feel very engaging. It borrows elements from other Teuber's games, such as "Entdecker" and the "Catan" series. I like it that every player always gets something in the production rolls. A series of unlucky events may cause great harm to some players and none to others, but there are ways to be prepared for them.

This is a faily straight forward game.  I like the part where one needs to accomplish 3 out of 5 objectives in order to win.  On the down side, there is little player interaction, and one cannot prevent another player from building his settlers/pioneers/townsfolks/merchants, not any other objective for that matter.

The resource cards could have been replaced by cubes instead, as they would have been easier to pick up (they could be hidden in your hand).

Excellent game. Settlers done the way it should have been. I love the variable win conditions. The choices of tactics are quite diverse... none of them seem like a game breaker as balance is maintained throughout.

It's adaptation from a RTS computer game are obvious but I enjoyed this one. Bits of Entedecker in here even make it more enjoyable for me. It has a good sense of urgency invovled and you must pay close attention to what others are doing, in case they are on the same upgrade path as you. I wonder what the expansion does for this.

Played this only once, in Essen when it came out. Didn't want to buy it, because I thought we would rarely play it. Wife talked me into buying it and has never been in the mood for another game since. 
Update: Eight years later, we played it (two players). What did we see in this? It is largely solitaire play, interaction happening only when grabbing the buildings. And the building choice is only partially a choice, as the player who has protection from both pirates and fire will win almost inevitably. Mediocre game.

Catan szerzőjének könnyed, de szórakoztató játéka. Mindenkinek van egy saját táblája, azokra felfedezőket helyezhet, amiket tovább kell képezni telepesekre, kereskedőkre, polgárokra. Hajókat kell építeni és azzal szigeteket felfedezni, ha felfedeztük lekerül a hajónk, de a felfedezett szigettel tudjuk növelni saját szigetünket. Az emberekhez és a hajókhoz szükséges nyersanyagokat kockadobások után kapjuk (mégis csak a Catan szerzőjének játékáról beszélünk). De az ellenfelek kockadobásainál is kapunk nyersanyagot, a sziget lapkákkal tudjuk módosítani azt, hogy mit kapjunk. Az árucikkeket az embereknek tudjuk eladni és tudunk vásárolni is árucikket. A rossz kockadobások viszont lehet, hogy kalózok támadását vagy tűzvészt hozhatnak. A cél, hogy az 5 győzelmi feltételből 3-at teljesítsünk, ha ez sikerül mi győztünk. 

Könnyed szórakoztató játék amiben a kockadobások ellenére kisebb a szerencse szerepe mint a Catanban.

RATING: 7
This game is easy and quick to learn, tha rules are clearly written, so you can almost start at once, esspecially if you have played settlers before. And that is eventually the biggest point of critisism. I think it is a mixture of Siedler von Catan with a little little bit Die Entdecker (explore some islands). That might be okay if you don`t own a copy of the formerly named games but if you own Die Siedler and esspecially  the Ritter und Burgen-Expansion you don´t really need this game. I don´t want to get misunderstood, this game isn`t bad, but you get the feeling that it is a quick shot, taken some rules from Siedler the boardgame, Siedler, das Kartenspiel (buildings which give you some advantages) and Entdecker. To copy some details and put them together in another fashion isn´t always bad but the improvements that come along with the buildings are a bit boring.

My family's favorite game!  Different strategies to win.  Visually pleasing. Only drawback is when one player is immune to both possible negative effects from rolling a "6," easily overcome by limiting each player to just one immunity.  Also, we use toy coins to replace the "gold track" on the board.

This has become a nice Settlers-alternative with our group.  The luck aspect is much, much lower, which helps ease the randomness grumblings.

Update 2013 July:  I have NO idea why I like this game so much.  I don't know anyone (besides Tim Kelly) who really enjoys Anno as much as I do.  I really like the multiple paths to victory.  One of these days, I'll find the expansion.

Seems very mechanical in that your choices are dictated by the resources you get, at least in the early game, as there is no trading with other players or the bank.  I won my 1st (and only thus far) game by getting 4 public buildings, 3 merchants, and 30  gold (3 tabacco islands helped and the public building that lets you sell it to merchants for 6 gold).

This is one of my favorite Teuber designs. You collect resources on die rolls and spend them to build buildings on your player board, or boats. The boats let you explore the game board which has lots of face down tiles on it. While sailing you can look under adjacent tiles and if you keep one you remove your boat from the board. 

There are 5 victory conditions, if someone has completed 3 of them then the game is over and they win. Some involve building on your player board and some involve hunting the board for the right tiles.

The game is not overly strategic but it is fun and good game play will get you a long way. Hand management is key since you collect resources but there's a hand limit of 5 cards. 

Of the Teuber games I've played I think this is better than Entdecker, hoity toity, and even settlers of catan, which I don't like as much as most people. However domaine (lowenherz) is definitely a better game.

Similar to Settlers only in that one uses a die to determine production.  Each person has an island one develops using pioneers, settlers, citizens and merchants.  Also involves exploration as you use ships to explore a hidden board with tiles that help you improve your own island.  Different disasters occur on a roll of a "6".  Solid exploration and development game.  No trading amongst players however and not too cut-throat.  Outside of racing for tiles on the map, there is very little player interaction.

Solid Euro that reminds me of Settlers in the method of resource production and the way in which one uses those resources to build up infrastructure and earn victory points.

Really nice time.  Solid mechanics, enough depth to be interesting and not a pushover.  While I like the theme I hate the artwork.  Using the actual images from the PC game is a cool tough however most buildings look like brown blobs and it is difficult to tell what you're actually looking at.  Maybe it's a contrast issue with the printing.  I would have much preferred to see them use clearer, cleaner design for the buildings.  Takes it from an 8 or 9 to a 7 for me.

This is an okay game, using purchasing power and some worker placement, and having multiple ways to win.  It plays fairly slowly, though, for what it is.  The mechanic of having to send out one of your boats to explore and possibly finding nothing for a long time is a bit tedious.

"Very good Game +" I would play this over Settlers anytime, and would play whenever asked.  There is plenty of player interaction:  exploring the world ("do I take what I have in hand, or allow the person behind me to take it?" or "they left it behind, so they are looking for. . . "), limited amounts of certain buildings (ala Puerto Rico)"get it now, or somebody else will".  Game works with 2, works differently with more. . . nobody is sitting on the side of the table wondering if they will ever get a resource (like in settlers) and you can alter what you get and how much it is worth with the colonists and settlements.  This is a fine little euro . . nice bits, and quick.

Given to me by my wife on Father's Day, 2007.

(June 24, 2007)  Initial reaction after one play is rather positive, although I discovered (much to my dismay) that only one person in a 3-player game can potentially get a VP from securing four different outposts.

If a game can get my wife worked up to the point that when she didn't win she grumped about how she got robbed, then it must suck you in pretty well.  (She'll kill me for writing this.)

(EDIT: Aug 22, 2007):  Oh hell.  I'd screwed up the rules about what you can have as an outpost, so yes, multiple people can get that set of victory points.  Outside of that, I think the game is pretty good.)

RATING: 5
Rating after one two-player game. It felt a bit like multi-player solitaire. If trading of goods between players was allowed, I would rate it higher.
The game ended in a race for the 30 gold, just by getting resources and selling them. Not that exciting.
EDIT: After a few 4-player games, the game got a bit better. Still I miss player interaction and planning capability.

So-so game with a significant first turn advantage for the first and second players in a four-player game.  Better than Settlers because of the wider variety of win conditions and vastly more even distribution of resources.  New artwork instead of graphics swiped from the computer game would have been nice.

Una mezcla entre Entdecker, Elasund y Colonos de Catan. Jugado una sola vez de a 2, me parecio un muy buen juego pero un tanto largo (cerca de 90 minutos con explicaciones de reglas). Interesante, con multiples caminos de victoria, y tenso hasta el final. Excelente para dos, aunque no se si con 4 personas resulte muy largo... quizas es mejor es ese caso jugar Elasund.
Update: Lo jugue de a 4. Es muy bueno, no tan lento, y mas tenso... de repente se acaba, justo a un par de vueltas de que todos ganen. Muy recomendable.

RATING: 4
If this were Teuber's first game, I might rate it a 6 or a 7. As I've already played Settlers, Entdecker, and the Settlers card game, I have to accuse this once-innovative designer of mailing this one in. Much like the Settlers card game plays itself, this has some of the same feel. Yes, you have to decide what and when to build, but you're always limited by the resources you get and the tiles you uncover. As has been noted, player interaction is minimal at best. Nice production values are a major plus. If you've never played a Teuber game, you'll probably find this an interesting, if rather sedate, game of resource management. If, like many of us, you've played any of the 3 games I mentioned above, you'll want to move on... there's nothing new to see here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Definitely stuff to like here.  A bit of press your luck in the beginning between jumping out ahead in the race while risking being hit by a disaster.  More strategic than tactical and definitely not confrontational.  Such a game has a place in my collection.  Got this in my ever-going quest for an explore-and-upgrade game.  Candamir didn't fit the bill, nor did Return of the Heroes.  This might be a winner.

RATING: 8.5
I don't really understand the low ratings here. This is a very good game. It is less frustrating than settlers, as a bad die roll in Settlers can cost you big time in production and road and settlement building against your opponents. Some here have complained about the lack of player interaction. I don't see this as a problem. There is a race element to complete the victory conditions before your opponents. That keeps players alert as to what their opponents are doing. And there is interaction on the sea board!! The fact that this game plays very well with as little as two players makes it especially nice. Rating raised to 8.5!

Simple to learn and lots of fun. Not a lot of interaction between players and it may seem like a race at points, but definitely worth trying. Also works well at 2 players.

This is a fairly forgettable game in the Entdecker "sail-and-flip-tiles" genre.  You're trying to build up your dice-based production, with discovered tiles allowing you to have better options for die rolls, and buildings allowing you to trade resources for money.  You need to achieve several victory conditions, but toward the end of the game as some players complete them, they can become impossible for others, which I found to be very frustrating.

Disappointing.  Started off great but then I couldn't wait for it to finish.  It's solitaire that eventually turns into a luck drive dice fest.  I think it's quite well-balanced and the whole game runs very smoothly, the computer-graphics on the pieces/board were excellent - but it's just a family game.  I wouldn't mind giving it another go but the replayability is minimal.  Plus, I think the dice were weighted too - only 1's & 2's popping up. ;-)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Many strategies to this game - more than some people here have suggested.  The player interaction occurs mainly in that only so many players can get particular victory conditions due to a lack of resources (islands, buildings, trade agreements, etc.).  Therefore it becomes a race type of game in that respect and also you can block opponents by going for stuff they're going after.  Pretty fun and between experienced players the end is usually very close.  Plays in about 1.5 hours with 4 experienced players.

About 2/3rds of the way through the game I wanted to die.  One of my least favorite gaming experiences. Strangely, I met some great new gamer friends through this and it didn't help the game at all.  Slow, plodding, huge agonizing downtime, random resources (Ala Catan but not as interesting).   This is more or less a solo game, there is NO player activity, and the only real choices that you have are deadly boring.  Worst of all it is not just painful in a short gunshot spurt, this is more like Chinese Water tourture.  Avoid at all cost with 4, I won't be going back to try with different group numbers.

On the edge of my seat trying to outrace my opponents in different categories.  Because it's a race to the finish, I don't see this game as "solitaire."

I'll be interested to see if there are strategies that are too powerful and throw the game out of balance.  So far I don't see any; hence the high rating.

This is a race game, as players try to attract and develop pioneers as quickly as possible so that they have their choice of public buildings.  The luck of the commodity production is mitigated by the ability to sell surplus goods and buy desired goods.

It's the same basic Settlers mechanisms, with some elements seen later in the Catan Adventure games.  It really is multiplayer solitaire, as there's no way that you can slow someone down from reaching his or her goal (the roll of the die dictates the disasters), but it's still interesting.  It needs to be played quickly, so that the down time is lessened.

A very good game, especially if you are bored with the Settlers.I have no idea why it`s so underestimated by other players.Worth having it.

Nicely made Catan-family game, plays great with 2.  Essentially a race for 3 of the 5 possible victory conditions.

Completely underwhelmed by this one. Makes Princes of Florence look chaotic due to player interaction. Solitare basically.

This one didn't really live up to expectations, but it's enjoyable.

Completely unrelated to my rating:

One of the most painful secondhand gaming experiences of my life was watching a group of inexperienced conventioneers try to figure out this game by having one player read the entire rulebook aloud.

We finished our entire 2-hour game before this unfortunate group finished their Anno 1503 rules buffet.  Ouch!

A good explore the world game. Similar to a mix of Settlers and Entdecker.

Played a few times with 4 players. The interaction between players is limited, but the game is rather pleasant overall. I like the way the players can choose their own goals.

Prefer this game to settlers, very easy to learn but good gameplay and enough strategy to make it interesting.

Far away from the pc-game!
I expected to much, maybe.  Anyway the game is not that bad, but the pc-game was great template to create MORE!

An okay exploration game. My play experience wasn't great, so I'm not sure that I'm in a great place to comment on the quality of the game, but it didn't strike me as anything special.

Light and fun.  Have to say that I enjoy this one, and so does the wife. Not a heavy thinker, but some strategy involved.  Themeatically quite good.  Yes, it's rather simple.  No, there isnt deep strategy.  But it's fun building your little player mat with buildings and sailing ships.  Fun all the way from 2 to 4.

The lack of player trading makes this much less of a game.  1701 is a much better game.  However, there are some fun things here, it just isn't as strong as many.

Too little player interactions. Basically you are just playing solitaire. Depends too much on the luck of getting the first couple of extra buildings.

Damals gespielt, dann sehr lange nicht mehr. Aber ich muss sagen, für zwischendurch macht es schon Spaß. Würfeln, taktieren, nicht zu komplex. Knappe 7.

1) Lanza para ver la producción (según lo que tu tablero tenga en la columna) 2) Invierte (construir barcos, reclutar pioneros, mejorar colonias, comprar o vender productos) 3) Navega y explora islas. Necesitas cumplir 3 de las 5 condiciones de victoria para ganar.

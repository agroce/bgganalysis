My first love when it comes to complex boardgames, evenhough I have been only 2 years old when it was released. A really detailled combatsystem and an even better universe surrounding it (with all the books available) combines to a great experience overallbecause we played it mostly in combination with the Mechwarrior-Pen&Paper-RPG.

Portuguese version.
Got this after Yom Kippur, so its my second "real" game.
What can I say, it´s BattleTech, it´s great.
I still have the old charts and some of my own created scenarios.
Almost perfect.

Mechs and mayhem, who could ask for more?  Sure the build system is fiddly along with damage recording, but you'll be hard pressed to find another game with a universe this deep to get immersed in, and that more than makes up for the shortcomings.

RATING: N/A
Haven't played this in about 10 years (as of 07/2006), but it's another one of my favorite game type: hexmap movement; multiple units, each with their own hit points and special abilities; many different types of units to use and design.  I remember lots of dice rolling and filling in little bubbles on record sheets, and mechs melting down from heat overloads.  Oh, the memories.  The Solaris VII mech-dueling rules made the game a lot more fun.

Battletech is the seminol game that introduced a generation to wargaming. Long beofre Warhammer 40,ooo, Battletech had geeks duking it out across tables and in basements. 

This game is still one of my favorites. The baic rules are easy to get into and hold countless replay options, while add-ons make the entire spectrum of warfare come alive. 

Battletech is a game for people tired of simplistic wargame systems such as Warhammer, but not looking to get into deeply realistic rules.

RATING: N/A
Plays since 1986 to numerous to count.  Still play on weekly basis.  This game may be too long and 'dicey' for many, but it is an extremely rich and fun game.  There is a 'living' universe in which players can choose from a host of evolving factions.  The game allows players to use many types of units such as BattleMechs, tanks, infantry, and aircraft.  The combat system is flexible enough to allow players to choose the complexity of their games by making many optional rules available for use.  The quality of components varies depending on the sourcebook or scenario pack, but is generally good.

A great mech war-game plagued by slow play, too much (and inconsistent) expansion content, and nagging logical inconsistencies. The game was at its best when it utilized rpg elements (particularly from Mechwarrior), though finding time to fully resolve battles was still problematic.

This original edition of Battle Tech certainly reads like a poorly written engineering manual that argues with the reader. However, it plays pretty elegantly. With the minor complaints of the "uninspiring" d6 combat system, most of this game feels pretty great when pitting lances of mechs up against opponents. It contains just about everything a good wargame should, including point-buying custom mechs.

Update 2016: I can say BattleTech certainly started me out on the excited end of the scale. A year later, I still enjoy all the technologies and strategies but find myself unable to stay motivated within a given game to play due to the initiative and movement system. Combat is probably one of the most amazing in a wargame that I've played. The movement system, while brilliant for how it handles player information, just slows the game to an absolute crawl. Combine these extended game times with the army prep time and scenario prep time and you're looking at a full time hobby that I just can't force myself to stick with. First impression score was an 8, but I have to bump it down to a 6.

A great game in the 90s, but it seems very dated now, and it takes some dedicated gamers to run a real BT battle. Also, the cardboard counters are unsatisfying compared to miniatures, but that way lies an expensive hobby that could be better spent on more games.

If you like taking SAT tests, or have an unhealthy obsession with doodling, then you'll love recording damage to your mech. Not a bad miniatures game. Not a great one either because it uses hexes, and battles between tiny lead-laden miniatures should use tape measures, not hexmaps. hexes are for squares, and you know it.

My rating is based on the 3025-3035 version of the game.  While the 'clans' were a good story element, creating mechs that no longer had to fear heat effects broke the game.  I do play when I can, just not after 3050.

Boardgame that is really a miniatures game.  Game shines best as rules for miniatures and played with miniatures.  The battletech universe is an interesting sci-fi environment reminiscent of Japanese anime Mecha.  (Original mechs were lifted straight from Robotech and subsequently removed from the game in later editions - e.g. Rifleman)  Game balance is questionable, but easily adjusted through house rules and scenarios.  Combat is dice based.  [GTI Code: TPCD]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Old school combat from 1985.  Very simple combat system, the terrain makes it interesting and adds a lot.  However it does suffer from being a longer game.  Definitely a roll the dice and trust in your weaponry.  Reminded me of Wooden Ships & Iron Men, the way that you cross out spaces to mark damage.  My biggest gripe is that the side that has a fewer extra warriors can end up moving unopposed with no chance for opportunity fire from the other side even if the other side has the initiative.

Batallas en un futuro lejano de escuadras de robots gigantes (Mechs de 6 metros de altura) pilotados desde dentro por humanos. Robots pesados con blindajes increibles y cargados de munición y armas devastadoras... lentos como tortugas y propensos a sobrecalentarse... y otros Mechs muy vulnerables, con armamento ligero y casi sin blindaje pero endemoniadamente rápidos y dificiles de impactar... Con variaciones de terrenos desde colinas, rios, carreteras... en fin. Y un excelente universo perfectamente ambientado, hacían que yo con 16 años pilotara en mis sueños aquellas máquinas más de una vez... Joder! lo escribo y de verdad que me emociono... Felices 16 años!

Todo es superable pero este juego para chavales es perfecto. Luego si quieres más complejidad de reglas puedes ampliar dentro del mismo universo de Battletech o cambiar a wargames y demás, pero es realmente recomendable...

Complete and unplayed. In fact, all the Mechs are still attached to the sprues. Cut them off and paint them up yourself. Record sheets are unused, rules are in great shape, as are the maps, and includes a 60 page Battletech Center Operations Manual. Box lid is a little dished, the left side is a bit wrinkled, and there is some shelf wear. Otherwise, the game is in super shape.  Traded away at GameStorm14.

A decent introductory war game. I first played in middle school, so I do mean introductory. It uses a full sheet to track each Mech; some people complain that it bogs down when you have too many units on the table, where I say the game isn't designed for battles that big.

Two big problems, IMHO. First, initiative: whoever wins initiative will move last. With light Mechs, that makes a huge difference, since you can get behind an opponent that's within effective weapons range. If you have multiple Mechs in the battle, you often see a "Conga Line of Death": the Mech who lost initiative in front, followed by the next Mech, then the next, and so on.

The point system was also a problem. Originally, there wasn't one: you might try bringing similar tonnage of Mechs, but there were definitely better designs out there. Then the Clans came along and threw tonnage balance completely out the window. Since I stopped playing, there have been a few attempts to make a more valid point system. I can't say how well they've worked, although they do appear to cover the basics well.

Been playing this since grade school. Probably not going to stop now. I regret that they never really made the move to using the new miniature scale from MW: Dark Age, since those designs finally yielded a credible, unifying aesthetic, since abandoned.

Battletech is a slow game that could really use a rethink on some levels, but unlike its various reimplementations, it really does give you complete control over everything your 'mech, tank, or squad does, and you can't fault it for that.

Fun, although handicapped by the fact that the 'Mech construction rules are easily exploited to make optimized units, whereas the "in-game" factions persist in using really terrible 'Mechs. Play balance is thus always a problem. It's also daunting for new players to learn -- I'm +2 to hit you because I ran, and +1 because you went four spaces, and +2 because of those woods, oh and I roll on the left side table which means a '9' is your right torso, etc. The new glitzy rulebooks look they have only raised the bar against newcomers. Hopefully they have fixed the frustrating Line of Sight / elevation rules that irritate me to no end.

Battletech was my introduction into table-top wargaming when I was only six years old. I barely understood what was going on back then, but as I mature I grew to love Battletech and it has remained a steadfast throwback for when I must go back to a simpler time in wargaming.

Loved the game when I first got it. Played a fair bit, bought a lot of the novels and loved playing the computer games when they first came out. But my favourite was an obscure shareware game on the Amiga that replicated the board game exactly. Having said all that, my rating is now based in nostalgia as I no longer find the tedious record keeping enjoyable.

This is a game, like Warhammer and others of that ilk, that is a hobby onto itself.  Like most miniatures games, much of the enjoyment comes from seeing painted miniatures on great looking terrain.  I played a few games using the old WhizKids MechWarrior figures on Heroscape terrain - which worked well and meant I didn't have to do any painting.

The game itself has older design sensibilities, and feels pretty fiddly.  But, it's a classic, and it's pretty fun.  Certainly the rules are conducive to an interesting narrative, which is what I like from this style of game.

Using an electronic spreadsheet really helps to keep track of the various units.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Good tactical game with a rich universe behind it.  Unfortunately, the record keeping can take time and the game system is a bit clunky.  However, the universe is good enough that I've made up my own set of rules that have almost the same tactics (more tactics, actually) and plays in half the time.  Without such altered rules, I would never play this game again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Another game that involves too much time and money investment. Not a bad system, but setting up scenarios, balancing the squads, and all that takes too much effort. The hex system is a huge improvement over the normally fiddly miniature game rules in any case, but so few people were ever willing to play this on the generic looking maps that the benefit was basically phantom as a result. (Note that playing this online takes this game from tedious to fun: I would rate the online version a solid 6, it still has gameplay issues, but online it's much faster)

This has the makings for a GREAT group game but alas despite many in the local gaming group who enjoy anime there have been no takers to get this on the table.  It has lots of detail with ability to add in small increments of new rules. Some streamlining of rules to aid game play over realism put's off some.  I'm ok with that as there are still plenty of choices to make and tactics to experiment with.  Reduced to reading rules in PDF, designing Mech's and thinking of what could be...

It's just an 8/10 because i've never played it beyond the cardboard counters and the few maps i have (that i've played about 200 times), but it would be about a 9/10 if the graphics were better. Mechanics like heat control and damage allocation makes you really enjoy the stress of the battle.

I've been playing Battletech on and off since the 1980's.  I really enjoy the myriad ways the game can be played.  It can be played on a hex-map, or with rulers and miniatures.  You can play it as a role-playing game.  You can play a campaign.  You can use Alpha Strike rules to play company level engagements in a reasonable amount of time.  This has recently seen an upsurge from me, as I can get the kids to play it.

Great table-top game.  However, beware the crit hit to the head - the game takes several hours to play, and if you get your top popped early in the game, you're screwed.  Our group had to modify some of the rules and that seemed to balance it out. Overall one of my favorite table-tops.

Giant freakin' robots.  Pretty fun, if simple, game.  Made great when you play it as GM'd scenarios instead of slugfests.  And never play with custom mechs.  Construction rules are so easily broken the game just gets lame.

Update 6-4: The whole game should just get reset.  Redo movement.  Redo damage.  So many old and clunky mechanics.  You can require 10 sequential 2d6 rolls for a single weapon's attack.  That is ridiculous.

Another old wargame that never gets played anymore. While it had tons of chrome (history, world-building, factions, etc) there  was no real mechanism for game balance and campaign-based replay. Wargames should not require a gamemaster.                                                                          Battletech simplified the mechanics of Star Fleet Battles and put it it a cooler post-apocalypse future filled with robots battling over the galaxy. It uses heat capacity rules to limit overgunned units instead of SFB's energy capacity system , though the outcome is equivalent. The change from a phased-movement to a turn-based one made for a less thoughtful, less tactical game (ie a dicefest). Typically, the sides blast each other until reaching short range. At this point the winner of the initiative (who gets to move last) positions his units out of the enemies' firing arcs and blasts them from behind.                                                                                                       As far as game balance, the "bristling with lots of little guns" advantage goes way too far: the damage-to-weight and damage-to-heat characteristics make units with a dozen tiny guns much deadlier than ones with the big guns. Therfore, many of the "heavies" are outgunned by their smaller peers. Too bad for the mechanics... such a well-done world. Play Silent Death instead, as it is in the same vein but much much better.

Rating is for orginal FASA version from the 80's, the only version I have played. It suffered from some problems, like frequent lucky headshots and weird rules for critical hits and ammo explosions. But it was still good fun in its time. I hear the newer versions fixed most of the problems (and introduced a few new problems) but I've only played the original version, back when I was in jr. high and high school. We used to draw our own maps on the write-on/wipe-off megamats, and use painted minis for mechs. We played the Mechwarrior roleplaying game as well.

Back when I was really into this game, I probably would have rated it a 9 or 10. I loved it that much. These days, I've simply moved on to other things and my willingness to get BT back on the table is pretty low. 

Also, I think I was probably viewing it with rose colored glasses back then. I've since played so many other wargame systems that I think are better developed. But that was then, this is now. Still a great game for its time.

Ah the memories, both old and new with Battletech.  There is a vast amount of material for this game however what I want to comment on, and rate for, is the most basic game possible for Battletech.

If you discard the HUGE amount of fluffy "historical" detail and disregard the more advanced tech that can be used then you'll find a very balanced combat simulator that offers up interesting decisions and satisfying results for the hobby gamer.

The game itself had from its inception (It was first called Battledroids, but Lucas zapped them with a lawsuit) had very clean rules which only needed slight revisions over the ensuing years to fix minor problems.  This allowed for , relatively speaking, quick gameplay compared to a lot of wargames out there, but nonetheless providing a lot of satisfying detail for the players.

What is more impressive is that the mech design rules were also well balanced from the start.  Designing a mech requires tough compromises in terms of the kind of performance you want to allow for in your design and thus a good range of possible combinations are allowed in how you play the game.

I'd rate this a 10 however I think that a lot of the later material added to the game waters down the interesting decisions players need to make with the original technology.  Too many additions solve the problems players face on the battlefield and thus make the game less interesting.  So if you are approaching the game fresh you do need to keep those kind of elements in mind to tweak the game to your liking.

The other cavet is that this isn't a game that you can just slap out and play.  If you are coming from a euro gamer perspective then you'll find things a bit (not too much though) more fiddly than you are used to.  However if you aren't bowled over by an overenthusiastic battletech player with reams and reams of RPG like sourcebooks then you'll find a very taught and straitforward system that is a lot of fun to play.  If you are wargamer, then all of this will be a piece of cake.

The BT universe that FASA created was pretty impressive, one that catches the attention of the RPGer in me. The number of expansions and supplements produced makes it a well fleshed-out campaign setting but do we really want to read through all that stuff to play a wargame? As a wargame, BT is also a little too incremental to be exciting. It's another box-checking game that gets tedious after a while.

Too slow and boring (doesn't have much to do and luck plays a huge part). Mechs are nice, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
[Combat, Hex and Counter, Science Fiction, Giant Robot, Customizable] {Any number of players:8} Rating jacks up to 10 if played as an integral part of a MechWarrior RPG. There's so much more at stake if the pilots are continuing characters in a storyline. Besides, how else do you explain things like the differences between 3025 and 3050? Outside of a RPG environment, and strictly as a boardgame, the classic lance matchup with equal tonnage is the best application of a 2 or 4 player game. [More] Battletech is a wargame / miniatures game, perhaps the best one ever made. It's broken up into two parts, creating your Battlemechs, and putting them into combat on the field. Creating the Mechs is just as much fun as the battle itself, but there are stock Mechs available if you just want to roll dice. I haven't played a miniatures game OR wargame that I've found as much fun as Battletech. The "clix" game is horrid compared to "real" Battletech - don't accept the crappy substitute. Play the real thing!

RATING: 8.5
Easily one of my favorite.
It's a memory engine for me as I grew up on it from the age of 10. A huge money sink hole sometimes, but man it's awesome.

Pros:
*MECHS!!!!!
*Detailed gameplay makes you feel like your really piloting your mech (rather than making you feel like you ARE the mech). 
*Huge open universe, allowing for some RPG elements. Tons of sourcebooks, new record sheets, thousands of different mechs, tanks, infantry, aerospace fighters and more.
*Massive, scalable battles with the new rules. 
*Huge amount of special rules for fog, rain, snow, blizzard (even hurricanes!), as well as many others that you can plug and play into your games.
*The stories you tell about the game you just played are often mistaken for a video game or a movie. "remember when you blew out my Hunchbacks leg actuator with your PPC and I fell in the river, busted my cockpit and drowned? That was something else!" 
*Just enough luck to make your second guess yourself, but it's skill based enough to at least keep the luck on your side in most situations. The best player almost always wins.
*The game stays interesting through out the entire battle. You almost never really know who will win (assuming you are playing with equally skilled players) until the very end. Some people flame the game due to the chance of a random head shot or something, but it is SO rare that you will get a head-shot, and even more rare to get one with a weapon that will actually destroy it. I say it adds tension to the game.

Cons:
*So much book keeping, it gets annoying sometimes.
*Hard to teach to others (for the reason above mostly).
*Expensive to get further than knee high into the universe. Minis are just the half of it. Source books and record sheets make it extremely expensive to get further into it.

I love the concept, but the execution just seems to make for a slow game.  And this is coming from someone who played SFB for years.  And clans seem to be broken, even in a campaign.

Solid core system, unfortunately not really playable out of the box.
Edit: After compulsively purchasing expansions as cheap digital downloads this summer, I am starting to see this game in a new light. The scalability from RPG to interstellar wargame alone warrants a higher rating. Some weird design choices relating to weapon stats persist, but are somewhat alleviated by optional advanced rules from Tactical Operations. I usually just houserule in longer weapon ranges and play on bigger maps, and the game becomes fantastic. Oh, and I flip-flop the ranges for autocannons, so that they decrease with decreasing calibre, because that works better for me.

RATING: 10
What to say more then the rate I give it, and I'm still convinced that's to underrate it!!! I played it for years, adding components, mapshets, cenarios, campaigns, almost every facet of the game. It has from the basic ruleset up, to space battles, one-on-one duels, massive campaigns, RPG, you name it you have it. For something that isn't comissioned from a TV series or movie trilogy (or must I say bi-trilogy? LOL), it is amazing the number of products it spawned. With my group we explored almost all the possibilities. The universe is fantastic. It as a great felling, so much that when you are playing it you  are doing more than just rolling the dice

One of the few games that I liked as a teenager that I could easily see myself playing again.  The rules have held up better than most from the same era, with a few of the rougher bits having been fixed over the intervening decades.

I used to love this as a kid, although at the time some of the rules were a little hard to figure out, usually when it came to elevation and shooting and line of sight, etc. But I still really enjoy the game. Would love to sit down for a few hours and play again, but who has the time?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I used to play this as a teen. I've always liked the Mechwarrior/BattleTech setting and it definitely introduced me to a more serious form of gaming (basically Wargames/Simulators). 

That said, it is a bit overly complex for what it is...with just the basics, it can be fun...but with all the expansions and options the FULL game/hobby offers, it becomes a lifestyle much like Warhammer, possibly more complex overall. 

So, I'll rate it a 7, +1 if you're a hobbyist, -1 if you're (like everyone else) too short on time/money to jump in to an endeavor like this.

I owned The First edition Battledroids and picked up the 1987 edition after a kid from my gaming club BORROWED my original and moved out of state with it and a little known role-playing game rule book two weeks after borrowing them to him.  I can't remember the kid's name or the Role-playing rules but I have never stopped playing this game, I even bought my son this game several years ago.  Some day I'll probably buy it for a grandson or granddaughter.  I loved playing the Amiga game 'Mechforce' , wish I had better luck with the emulated version as it never seems to work properly.

If you're looking for a giant robots/mecha shoot em up game, then look no further. I can't count how many hours I sunk into painting minis and building terrain for this one. Since set up, tear down and the game itself are so long, I haven't played in years.

A whole day affair if done properly. I enjoyed the 3060's the most. It was clunky system, but for it's day, it was good. But, there are, by far, much better and more elegant miniatures games out there than this one.

Building the Mechs was even more fun than fighting them.  In the end, short-range weapons were just too powerful.  I invented some crazy mech with nothing but machine guns to prove the point and we never played much after that.

This game has a soft spot in my heart.  My other hobby is model building, so painting little lead miniatures falls right into the fun category for me.  The rule book is a little daunting at 300 pages but the huge story line, 20 video games, huge fan base all add up to a 9 for this RPG.

A favorite from my childhood. One of the better RPG worlds in my opinion, and while a tad slow, I love the combat system. I would definitely play this more often (and perhaps rate it even higher) if I had people to play with on a regular basis. (Sadly?) I do enjoy playing this solo.

(08/2008) Comment based on 2 plays.

Very cool SF premise, lots of detail, but essentially a dice rolling contest. Winning strategy: roll lots of box cars when rolling on the hit-location table. A '12' is a hit to the head, and with two hits can usually kill the most menacing mech. This is one of the reasons I didn't care for Starfleet Battles, another FASA design, because I really don't have much control over where I hit. With a willing suspension of disbelief, I was able to enjoy the somewhat immersive Battletech universe. It's a solid '5'.

Update (04/18/2015): A board gaming group at work hosts an annual tournament of BattleTech. However, that game where I killed a larger mech with two "12" rolls in succession deflated any sense of wonder I had for the game. Custom building your own mech is a huge appeal of the game, but that's about it--the combat resolution is quite dated. It's supposed to be in the far future, and yet we have to roll to hit, and we can't even target specific areas. There are no techs that I recall that help with getting hit modifiers. Why is it that I'm okay rolling dice to hit in Eclipse, but it just seems totally unacceptable in the BattleTech universe? Dropping to a "4". I'm actively avoiding this one.

What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? 
The very first "serious" board/wargame I ever played, and it helped me learn English. For those who enjoy some fluff with their dice rolling, look no further...the number of novels in the Battletech universe could probably fill the sci-fi section at a bookshop.
I never tried the mech-building or RPG aspects of teh game, but I hear they add entirely new dimensions if you are willing to invest the brain sweat to figure out armor tables and the like.
The game has come a long way from being a simple one-box boardgame with robots stolen from japanimation programs...i highly suggest people try it...you can get free quickstart rules and counters from Fanpro...i dont think you will be disappointed.

Del rol pasé a este juego de simulación. Puedes jugar sólo con las reglas básicas o ser un auténtico jugón y entrar en las avanzadas. No sólo juegas cuando estás frente al tablero, sino que también lo haces cuando optimizas tu mech o creas otro nuevo. Pegas: ¿quién tiene tanto tiempo como para crear, optimizar, montar el tablero y echar una partida? Reglas avanzadas arduas para novatos. Reglas básicas sosas para expertos. Esto crea un efecto “pescadilla que se muerde la cola” y no se juega cuando hay ambos niveles. No lo venderé. Mis hijos crecerán batallando contra los mechs de su padre

Great "miniatures"-like game without having the expense of buying miniatures (unless you want to).

I will always love the "engineering" games like this one where you tinker with the mechs before and after each battle.  Designing the mechs is nearly as much fun as playing.

Spent many happy evenings playing with the older rules (no figures, just a cheap battlemat or the paper maps and chits) and had a blast.  Favorite part was always designing new mechs...

Tried a little of the roleplaying version, too, and was fun, though never really enjoyed it as much as some of the other roleplaying titles.

Oddly, this for me was one of those games that the more they added to the rules, the less I played.  (So, a disclaimer: I have little to no familiarity with the more modern versions of this game).  Still, very enjoyable and recommended!

RATING: 7
**NOTE: This was a 9 in my youth**. 

I loved this game when younger (and still do), but the current rating is for it's chances of play now. 

man the image of huge mechs going toe to toe...jumping high above the trees with gas vents blasting steam like dragon's breath...crashing through buildings and mountains...digging HUGE divets as they are knocked into next Tuesday....missles rushing out in nasty arching streaks....damn...it still sounds fun to me. 

The fact that I don't recall all of the little rules plays into the lower rating. It would be hard to teach folks now, but teens and early college guys will still like it. I'm not crazy about the new pre-painted clix version, but the classic is still classic in my mind. 

I loved the Robotech Cartoons, I loved Mechwarrior added into Battletech...I loved the Mech RPG by Palladin (was it Palladin?) mixed in with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles RPG by the same company...

Too bad I'll probably never get it out again. I was into all of the various houses and mythos in the system. I even wanted the war game/board game version of this that said it had fog-of-war in it....what was it called? I had "succession wars" and that's not it. I think most teens and early college folk will really dig this though. Show them the Robotech DVDs and play the game and they're in. It has tactics, resource managament, and strategy, and with Mechwarrior RPG...living characters that you grow with.

**UPDATE 5/28/2005: I'm strongly considering breaking this out at the moment.

I loved playing this game in college with my roomate.  Of course, part of the fun was deciding that Friday and Saturday would be spent locked in mortal combat.  We would begin around 5 pm making up mechs with a tonnage limit, order pizza at 7, and again at midnight.  My roomate&#039;s girlfriend would usually break up the game at about 9 am to demand that we go to breakfast.
All of this made for good college fun, but now it just seems like way too much effort to do something that I can do faster and more graphically on a computer.

My original mech simulator board game which I spent countless hours playing.
Loved designing my own mechs with special builds and then abusing their qualities on the battlefield.
This game takes some time and effort but it rewards everything you put in it.
Also like the more advanced rule possibilities, with fire, smokescreen and physical combat.
Fond memories of building a gunship mech with heatsink legs and then going to stand in the lake and blow everything in sight to pieces!

The classic FASA game. I always found the game ok to good with the basics, but when the clans hit the scene the game jumped up in appeal, the new tech and dangerous clan mechs really making the game shine in my eyes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Truly reaches its own when played in a large convention setting with 20+ players who know the game by heart.  Anything less than a company against another company I find boring and this is a problem because you need lots of people who all know what they're doing to handle that many mechs.  On those rare occasions when you meet all the above criteria, it does make for a hell of a game.

Otherwise, all the classic hallmarks of FASA design.  Very crunchy, with detailed recordkeeping and a fair amount of wristage.  Lots of freedom for customizing mechs, with rather less attention paid to how the abstract tonnage system influences game balance.  When playing with the 3025 technology, the heat system is ingenious and forces a player to think about how much he can realistically do with his mech.

Uno de mis juegos clásicos pre-BGG. Combate táctico entre 'mechs. Jugué infinidad de veces y es divertido ver cómo se van desgastando los 'mechs bajo los impactos, pero no creo que vaya a ver la mesa mucho más. Las reglas son bastante confusas.

Del orden de 50 partidas sin loguear.

RATING: 9
I rate BattleTech the system as a 10 for me, after a long time (relatively speaking) of holding it at a 9. This game is, for me, at the pinnacle of war games. At its core a fairly simple system of giant fighty robots, it becomes far richer as you add in different types of combatants (vehicles, infantry, aerospace), different maps, different levels of rules, new equipment, and on and on. Couple the solid mechanics, evolved over 20+ years, with a vibrant (if derivative) fictional world, and you've got a lot of room to play. Games can be simple pickups between randomly chosen 'Mechs or "historical" battles drenched in optional/advanced rules, and it's good either way. The game also enjoys a fantastic level of official support from Catalyst and unofficial support from the game's extensive fan base.

Many of my comments on the game, a game that I like very much, are in the Introductory Box Set entry.

Great game.  The original (pre-Clan/Inner Sphere) is still the best.  The fact that the games based upon this classic are still being produced is a testament to its solid design (even the later games - set in the same universe - are not nearly as good as the original, and share few, if any, rules with the game that started it all).  The rules are detailed, yet are simple and easy to follow.

Big mecha blowing up stuff.  Can't go wrong!

Just fun. The rules are plain easy if you are playing pure BT without Infantry, Elementals, Tanks or Aerospace Fighters, but can be stacked individually with those game elements to adjust the level. Recommended is a game group with at least four players, then BT is pure fun. Not this good with only two players, you really need a certain element of chaos :) Only downside: You need luck, luck and more luck. And often you don't have it and then... the best strategy can't help you.

RATING: 5
This is the first of any kind of miniature game I ever played, and while I was already familiar with all of the unseen mechs used from Dougram, Crusher Joe, and Macross, I laughed at Battletech. There really is no strategy, just move everyone to the center of the board and start shooting. And the system itself is impossible to play large games where you could implement strategy. 

I am still so amazed this game got as popular as it did. Not to mention the setting too which so many novels and additional rulebooks were written for. I think those suck too.

And yet, there is something special to me about the Second Edition set, with the poorly edited ripoffs of Japanese artists and all. I have too many games to consider playing before dusting off that oldie, but I do like owning it. Also, I am a fan of the old TCI model sets that included the scenarios. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played it a lot as a 12-13 year old RPG aficionado, before I was really into board games. The main problem is that despite it being very light, the bookkeeping of damage, ammo and heat is quite fiddly on the "character sheets", and slows the game down too much. Doesn't evoke the feeling of fast and furious mech combat. Designing new mechs was the most fun part.

I remember my PC Mech Warrior game so long ago...that brought me into the BattleTech universe un-intendedly!  As an SFB enthusiast, this is the equivalent on the land. It seems to be more streamlined than SFB too. We used the miniatures rules. We played Trial by Fire and The Final Examination with some catapults, spiders etc. With the variety of mechs types, the game opens up a whole new world to me. It means more money spent for yet another universe of the Inner Space!

A friend taught me a game of this and bloom, this is awesome!  The mech-to-mech core game system is very very streamlined: initiative determination, movement, combat and physical combat (melee), heat (the legendary calculation of heat with possible shutdowns) and then end phase.  Each phase is easy to understand and he explained the rules to us while we were on the go with the scenario "Trial by Fire".  We learned the rules and got them down before going further to another scenario "The Final Examination".  

I found that Battletech is really THE si-fi tactical game for the wargamers.  With all the normal wargaming conventions like hex and counters, facing, line of sight, allocation of hits and critical hits etc., a wargamer feels right at home after sitting into the cockpit of the mechs.  

The game begins with each side rolling 2D6 for the initiative.  The player who lost the initiative goes first, while being watched by the opposing mechs on where to go.  Movement basically costs 1 MP cost on each clear terrain, with hills and water elevations costing more. If the mech has a line of sight to another mech, it can attack with range weapon or closing in for melee.  Range weapons include laser gun, long and short range missile, auto-cannon etc.  Hitting an opponent is a function of range and gunnery skill.  If they hit the target, the player then rolls on the missile hits table for checking how many hits they can make onto the target.  Each hit should determine the hit location with another table.  The number of damages would depend on the type of weapon, e.g. each auto-cannon hit can do 2, 5, 10 or 20 damage to the target.

Played this a lot back then.  It was good for its time but this version of the system is very dated by today's standards.  Slow, clunky game although there are some nice tactical options that could change the outcome of a battle.  I also loved the mech design rules.  Vanilla Battletech (pre-Clan) was somewhat plausible except for the point blank range with 10 metre tall targets and some lore of a handful of mechs holding down a planet.

Stick with the original plus the first expansion (the one before the clans and the new weapon types).  Makes play go faster with fewer ranges to memorize.  You also have to get a set of maps too.  The two maps that come with the game (which are identical, you just place then together in different positions) get stale pretty quick otherwise.  Giant robots, stat sheets for weapons and armor, hex based instead of open measuring for ease of play; what's not to like?

When I was in high school, this was one of my favorite games. I got hooked on the idea of constructing my own mech and I spent hours designing mechs and lances. When I stopped playing the board game I moved on to playing a knock off version on my Amiga. Today, I have little desire to play this, but I still get a thrill from mech design in the form of Armored Core on the Playstation/PS2. I'm glad that WizKids/FanPro have released the basic rules for free. in case I ever decide to go back and play for nostalgia's sake since my original game was borrowed and never returned.

Personally, I would prefer an enhanced construction system where there are more subtleties to the balance of parts during the construction and for their eventual field use.

Classic BattleTech is where I learned to love army building and unit creation. I spent hours and hours in high school and college designing 'Mechs, complete with Technical Readout-style backstories.

It's also the only minis game I've ever been even semi-competent at painting -- I can handle 'Mechs; painting people isn't my thing.

College was the last time I knew anyone who was really into BT, so it's been a long time since I've played it.

RATING: 9
The best mech game. Yea it's old and yea, if you are going to have every mech fight to the bitter end instead of having reasonable forced withdrawal rules it can take a long time. 

Those problems aside, no game better caught the way mech combat should be. Not the crazy skating impossibly mobile giant robots of ridiculous anime, but heavy, solid and detailed war machines slugging it out.

Nowadays the mechanics will seem a bit clunky, a roll to hit a roll for where, maybe several for a cluster weapon and maybe more for critical damage, and that's one weapon! But play it enough and you won't need to look it up. To this day I know an average gunner who walked his undamaged and not overheating mech shooting at target in the open 7 hexes away that moved 5 hexes with a particle projection cannon needs to roll a 9 to hit. Give me a his location related to the target and a number between 1 and 12 and I'll tell ya where he hit. 

Still the best mech game.

RATING: 7.5
Great fun if you take the time to develop some tools for play; current iteration both vastly improves the organization of the original '80s system and relies too heavily upon it.

The current RPG system, however, (which is not necessary to play) is an appalling mess of good ideas flailing about on the page (it's beta . . . no, alpha . . . nowhere near production-level in any serious sense).

Great background material; great support; scales very well; great miniatures; great expansions and expandability . . . it is a true classic of Ameritrash wonderfulness.

Simply the best science fiction tactical warfare game around.  Nothing else compares to the options available in this game.  The many eras available in the Battletech timeline allow players to experiment with old as well as new tech and see the different effects that this has on the battlefield.

My only complaint is the lack of small scenarios (4 or less Mechs) as the larger more common 8 or more Mech scenarios take far too long to play.

This may be the coolest game concept outside of Car Wars, although I really doubt battlemechs could move as is suggested by the game and described in the books. I also have a problem with systems where armor is gradually worn away to nothing -- I actually prefer the system used in Renegade Legion, where different weapons caused different damage patterns to armor.

Great old arcade mecha combat. Still the VERY best around.
On the bad side: there's definitely some luck here, eg. a single head shot can kill you, but the overall game is so good that it's ok nonetheless (with time, you accept the little flaws of your beloved - and hey, we know that you can win a combat with luck, don't you?)

Still the gold standard in terms of plasticity (you can design your own mech), hardware and weapons. That's FRONT MISSION - the boardgame, ante litteram ;)

Ah one of the games of my teens.

Giant mechanized robots called Mechs would slug it out with all manner of weapon systems (auto cannons, missiles, plasma cannons etc). Piloting these things and traversing the terrain was no easy feat and falling over was fairly common.

The concept of heat build up and the use of heat sinks was a major element that stopped players from simply launching everything they had each turn.

Battletech was a table heavy game, requiring rolls to hit and then hit location tables. It may be a game for the past for some people but I don't think I'd ever tire of it.

One to show the boys when they are a little bit older.

Slow, but not at all complex, and with plenty of room for strategy.  Easily expandable.  Custom mechs are quite similar, due to a series of optimal power/weight ratios and poor weapon design, but if you're using the official, pre-built machines there's lots of room for fun, assuming you are careful in balancing them.

Piloting huge mechs and blasting the crap out of other player's mechs is a lot of fun.  It's just a pity that this game is a bit overly complex and lengthy.  I did like the design rules - it was a challenge to fit as many options into your mech as was legally possible.  However, I only enjoyed games with a couple of mechs each and no more than 4 players (due to the time factor).  Haven't played it for years.  I was lucky enough to pick up a near-mint 3rd edition boxed set (with the 14 plastic miniatures) and two large maps for AUD$0.50(!!!) at the local flea market!  I'd only consider playing this again if the rules and record-keeping were more streamlined.  I can't, however, justify getting into clicky Mechwarrior.

I simply love the game background, and the game mechanic.
IHMO, the expansions are way too powerful for the game. You will have weapons that alter the fight mechanism, even if i really dislike the lack of indirect fire rules in the "basic" box.
You will find a lot of programs, mechs, utility and PDF in the web.

This can be a light game or a heavy game, and the more you play, the more intricate and neat the rules are.

Another classic, and always fun to play. Randomness and not so smooth dice table system are drawbacks in todays standards, but this game has so much meat over it's bones that even a bit outdated mechanics can not turn it down. You'll have to accept the logic of the 30 foot walking tank to enjoy this one, but if you do, this game surely has almost every part covered from there on. Heavy system, although easily run with new players if one of the players know it well. Larger battles take forever though, as system relies heavily on book keeping and dice tables.

I continue to play this game years later. While I have stopped following the novel sagas and new supplements, the old Succession Wars dark ages with mecha theme still holds my interest. With lower technology 3025-era mechs, this game has a nice balance of movement, tactics (heat management) and firepower that few armor games can equal. Outside the 3025-era, I rate the game only a 6.

Played the heck out of this game in highschool (90-92-ish). We played through a regimental sized unit in a grand campaign. Many a school night was squandered in the carnage. We kept a detailed log of campaign, and sort of made a "roleplaying" version. Not only were the battles large (usually at least a company per side) and intense, we had a great time coming up with colorful ways of describing the victories and defeats. Ah, to be young and have infinite free time again.

RATING: 6
It's a fun game that rewards the use of real tactics, even though the game scale is a little silly and the 'tanks with hit points' feel of the damage system no longer appeals to me. Provided many, many hours of fun through my teen years, including the joy of using the simple unit design system. If you like it and have friends to play it with, tremendous replay value.

The crunchiest of crunchy wargames. I'm drawn to it for a few reasons that make it unique - partially its complexity, but mostly because of the lore and the franchise itself. I grew up with the MechWarrior PC games, and they very much feed into my like of Battletech (though I've never actually played it on the tabletop, rather over MegaMek, which makes the entire experience much smoother!)

When I was in college I played in a thoroughly enjoyable Mecha RPG where we used the BattleTech sheets and rules during combat. My character was a crazy Mexican who kept a crucifix hanging in his cockpit and occasionally went berserk with his mech.

With those fond memories in mind, I picked up this game. But I haven't played it at all.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable wargame that focuses on fun rather than detail. The heat management mechanism is really interesting, and leads to lots of great choices: river vs high ground, incindiaries vs armour piercing etc. Probably the best U.S. game of its era / peer group (Car Wars, Ogre etc). 

Haven't played in years, but rememer it as one of the few hex-and-counter games of the era that could draw me into its world without the use of miniatures.

When I was a kid I used to stay up late at night building 'Mechs on graph paper.  A lot of the fun is in customizing 'Mechs, if you just pick up templates and play against other templates, it's probably not as much fun.

In my experience, playing pre-built 'Mechs will probably take you 1-2 hours per game, entirely depending on how aggressively everyone is playing.

1st game i played at a club.Next week i arrived and they were playing Squad Leader and i asked why they were not playing Battletech and i was told they played a differant game every week.I had played Squad Leader before but i was picked on with opp fire and i only played a few more times with this group-squad leader too(what about a new game each week),too many rules lawyers.
I really liked Battletech too-i bought 2 editions of it and the rules compendium.

RATING: 6
Great fluff in the BT universe, on par with Star Wars, Game of Thrones or 40K. I enjoy this game on occasion, but wish there was a (very) streamlined version that maintained the feel of BT - mech customization, location based damage, combined arms, and "role-playing" of factions. Something on the level of complexity and depth of X-wing but had all the good stuff from BT. Alpha-strike still seems too complex/cumbersome (my assumption based solely on there being a hardbound and Mechwarrior lost the "flavor."

Purchased 4th ed box set put out by WizKids (WOTC) on 7-3-2006, and just picked up the intro box w/ 24 plastic mechs.. Much nicer production values than the CityFight set I picked up in 1997/98. Any armored vehicle hit at short range by a missile barrage should be a slag heap, but it takes a long time to take a 'mech down. Lots of bookkeeping, lots of background fluff. Plays slower than all the other minis games I have. Have to be in the mood for me to want to play. Kudos for the ongoing support this game gets, even though it is often erratic.

Plays since 1986 to numerous to count.  Still play on a weekly basis.  This game may be too long and 'dicey' for many, but it is an extremely rich and fun game.  There is a 'living' universe in which players can choose from a host of evolving factions.  The game allows players to use many types of units such as BattleMechs, tanks, infantry, aircraft, and spacecraft.  The combat system is flexible enough to allow players to choose the complexity of their games by making many optional rules available for use.  The quality of components varies depending on the sourcebook or scenario pack, but is generally good. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A rich and varied universe and more 'Mech combinations than you can shake a red-hot PPC at make this an intriguing and entertaining wargame that I'm sure to have loads of fun with.

RATING: 9
A highly stylized Mech' combat system suitable for any tabletop gamer. Expansive, almost sprawling game universe to draw from with its own unique and rich history and storyline. Hundreds of books, technical readouts, sourcebooks and maps supplement the basic game and add incredible flavor to what is already a smorgasbord of a gaming experience. 

While the combat system is tried and true and very reliable the repetitive nature of combat rolls and the detail work may turn off a lot of gamers. 

Still, one of my favorite games of all time and well worth the investment. BattleTech players may leave from time to time, but they always come back eventually for more Mech' mayhem.

Lots of time spent playing this one. You could play reasonable battles with just a handful of miniatures and my group at the time passionately loved games that had a meta-game customization aspect to them.

Good game. As with Star Fleet Battles and Car Wars, I always preferred to stick to the original game, which was perfectly fine by itself, but many of my gaming compadres wanted to use every single supplement and expansion available. 

I would have rated it higher for just the main game itself. With all the add-ons, it quickly got to be too much.  Cool miniatures though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent table-top strategy game. This one one of my favorite games, growing up, not for my love of mechs alone, but for the way it handles mech combat. Most of the game dynamics 'feel right' and are as believable as a 30-foot fighting robot gets.

Mechanically, his game serves as something of a bridge between traditional war games and more tactical action games. I dare say it even flirts with RPGs. Those used to more modern, simpler games, usually wont care for all the chart-chasing. The more seasoned players however, will likely enjoy how the elements tie together without bogging the game down. The game can be slow to start, but ever draws you away from understanding what's happening.

I played this and the modules for several years, as a board game with standies and with minis.  I think I had all the original modules, including the Solaris VII module with the gladiator combat sort of fighting.  I had a subscription to Battletechnology Magazine for at least 2 years, had most of the expansion map sets, and even got an original poster from a game store in Kentucky, with the cover art from the game and the first 4 scenario books.  Guess you could say I was really addicted to this stuff.  I bought the Revell robot kits when they came out, even got the Mech Factory kit to use for larger scale gaming for the Battletroops rules.

RATING: 7
A solid game that has simply waned in interest for me as the years have passed.  The best feature are the sheets for the mechs, replete with "damage circles" that are penciled in as you blast away your opponent.  A fun game to be sure, just a little time intensive.  I imagine that this is fun incarnate with a campaign system and a committed group of players.

It's not that battletech is too complicated for me to understand, it's that the complications take more time to understand than they add to the game.
Also I don't like having to roll 2d6 a dozen times.  I would think if they were going to make you roll for each 1 point pellet of a shotgun blast, they would come up with a relatively simple way to do it.

A fun game, but needs some major revamping and maybe toning down, making the shooting phase less complicated so things move quicker?  Of course, you could buy the new Mechwarrior Clix game.

This was the only other game I've ever stayed up all night playing.  It was horrible but we saw it thru to the bitter end.  My friends and I all hated each other by the time we finally finished.  Not the effect of a wonderful game in my opinion.  Besides that, it just took way too long and wasn't interesting.

I've always had a soft spot for this game, and like it perhaps more than it deserves. The fun of selecting/designing my giant fighty robots, taking them into battle, and blowing off chunks of the other guy's robots is enough that I can overlook the game's many flaws. And there are lots of those. The combat system, while not really complicated, requires numerous DRM's that are calculated and recalculated every turn for every weapon you fire. Games take quite some time to complete - 1/2 hour per mech isn't a bad rule of thumb, and 8 total mechs (4 hours) is the smallest standard game. Forget about any semblance of "realism" in the system - this might as well be pure fantasy. Weapon ranges in particular are totally preposterous. And it's dicey as hell, with a typical mid-heavy weapon able to one-shot kill any mech in the game, given the right combination of die rolls.

But it's fun. I like the backstory of feuding factions. I love poring over Technical Readouts trying to better understand all the tools available. I really love vaporizing an opponent's midsection with an AC20 or having my puny small laser hit an exposed ammo bin, blowing a mech to smithereens. There's a lot of drama to the game. But there's also a solid core of maneuver and getting your units to cooperate effectively that the more "serious" wargamer in me finds very appealing. Just running your mechs pell-mell toward the enemy is very likely to get you blasted right quick. You need to understand your units' strengths and use them carefully to create a collective advantage.

Battletech is also a bit unique in what's probably a love/hate kind of way - it's sort of RPG'ish. When you're actually playing, it's a pure tactical board wargame. But there are reams and reams of sourcebooks and background fluff out there and the game is presented in such a way that you'll probably want to explore it, even though it has zero impact at the table. There are many scenarios available, but many of them are mere sketches and leave a lot open to player interpretation and creativity. Similarly, there are no force selection tables like you might expect to find in this sort of game. The expectation is that players have some "historical" knowledge about the game world and use that (along with some rough combat ratings) to create forces and scenarios with a plausible narrative. I actually find all this quite charming and enjoyable - the backstory, while not to be confused with Asimov or Clarke, is decent enough sci-fi and the sourcebook material is quite exhaustively detailed and consistent. But if you're looking for a more typical game with a bunch of pre-made scenarios ready to play out-of-the-box, you may be disappointed with this aspect of the game.

Got this more than 20 years ago. Didn't really play it until now when I started digging thru my collection of board games. Then I realise Battletech is such a fun tactical wargame. Downloaded the latest introductory rulebook and even bought Total Warfare and Tech Manual. What a rich universe! I think I will be into Battletech for many years to come, not to mention many campaigns. The only bad thing about the game is that it requires at least 2 persons to play it. Wish there are solitaire rules for this game.

Battletech is the first miniatures game I ever played.  I fell in love with the Battletech universe through the Mechwarrior PC game.  I love how Battletech tries to simulate reality and take almost everything into account.  Although not a light game, Most new gamers i introduce it to like it.  It's fun, and has a creative element with painting minis.  My only problem is that it takes a long time to play, and some rules are a bit ambiguous.  Also the sheer volume of text you need to read to  understand the rules can be a bit overwhelming, but i love the game!  See my Review.

One of the first serious "gamer" games that I and my friends got into back in junior high and one that we still play to this day when given the chance.  A good, solid, absorbing game, BT is just filled to the brim with so many cool little details.  

ANY game where you can blow off a giant robot's arm and then pick it up and beat him over the head with it while at the same time trying to carefully balance how many of your weapons systems you fire off in an attempt to keep your nuclear powered engines from overheating to the point where all of your ammo starts going off like popcorn inside your armor is a GOOD game.

Husband's game. What does he like about it?  I think fiddling with a ton of numbers as he figures out how hot he is. Plus I think he just likes to say "jump jets". And the explosions. One of the games that takes awhile, so doesn't get played very often.  And if he wants me to play a complicated drawn out game with oddles of statistics and things to track he has to switch over to Silent Death anyway.

Absolutely amazing.  I love all of the miniatures.  The movement is very strategic.  Facing is a part of movement so a unit's backside is very vulnerable.  Choosing your mech is very important when going solo (Solaris Style).  However, if you are playing a scenario, movement, heat management and teamwork are more important than keeping your mech alive.  Although sometimes the die values you need to roll are very high and seem to stay high, only when you are at the right range the combat gets interesting.

Were it not for this game I would be a great deal richer.  Originally got a little boxed set, a few years later got a rulebook, bought up just about everything I could get my hands on ever since.  Finding players can be a little difficult (as with any game with numbers to keep track of and/or hexes on a paper map), but a lot of the "out-of-battle" things are almost games in and of themselves (primarily designing 'Mechs, but a few other things such as mercenary units have been introduced over the years).  If you have a role-playing group, the Mechwarrior RPG (now Classic Battletech RPG) can mix with this quite well, although neither is required to play the other.
Overall a great game if you enjoy more complex games.  Eurogamers beware, though.

BattleTech is a tactical wargame where players maneuver giant fighting robots ("BattleMechs," or "'Mechs") against each other (or vehicles and/or infantry) on hexagon-based maps. The complex game system includes details such as varying weapon ranges, heat generation, and discrete hit locations (torso, arms, legs, etc.). 'Mechs vary greatly by mobility and firepower, and players can choose from provided designs or take the time to create their own 'Mechs from scratch. The base game includes a introduction rule book for helping new players getting around fast. The game board is extensible, and there are many map packs available for purchase or even download.

RATING: 4
One thing Battletech has going for it is a phenomenal story line. This backdrop is one of the richest in gaming. The different factions, clans, and characters are both deep and interesting. Like L5R, fan loyalty to the fiction probably has kept this game alive much longer than expected, in spite of its clunky mechanics. Besides, you saw the Transformers movie. Giant robots are damn cool.

Component wise, Battletech is what you make of it. It is, after all, a miniatures game. The miniatures are old school, the type in which you need to apprentice in Metallurgy to properly assemble them. That being said, in the hands of an experienced painter the models can be stunning. The TOTAL WAR Rulebook, the current basic rules set, is gorgeous. The layout is great, relevant rules are easy to find, and there are loads of pictures that show off some elaborately painted mechs. A very nice production, although somewhat more entertaining than the game itself. I say that because this game requires slavish devotion. The mech record sheets look more like 70's era computer programming punch cards than game components. There are dozens of variations on the same basic weapon systems and to keep the game from slowing to a complete crawl, someone has to know the relevant rules. The whole thing tends to be quite ponderous, and not nearly as fun as it should be.

To a casual gamer, a round of Battletech goes something like this:

1. Move pieces. So far so good.

2. Declare targets. Excellent.

3. Roll 23,427 dice. Wait for a fanatical 10-year Battletech veteran to interpret and recite the results to you. Uh-oh.

4. Roll 16,734 more dice. Consult 437 tables to determine hit locations, special effects and damage results. Unless of course, this was a missile attack, in which case you must go to step 3 and repeat. Alternatively, just stare hopelessly at the dice until the Battletech veteran from step 3 recites the results for you...again.

5. Color in 84 little circles with a pencil.

6. Repeat 6 times.

Congratulations, you've just survived your first Mech battle. Sixty seconds of hair-raising combat distilled down into four and a half hours. Now let's try it with four Mechs at a time!

I played this a lot in my youth,and had a blast with it. That was also the late 80's, so there was very little competition from other games. Battletech demands its players know every nook and cranny of both the rules and the CRTs or the game is just not fun. Battletech is a game from another time and simply doesn't hold up to modern games. When I need to scratch the Rock'em Sock'em Robot itch, I'll just play Mechwarrior. Good or bad, at least it's over in an hour...

Excellent game, but the number of dice rolls that need to be made and tables that need to be consulted (or memorized) is high.  I recommend the online version called MegaMek, where the dice rolls are done automatically and the cost to field of each mech is based on actual field effectiveness.

In a way, it's impressive that a game that was so poorly balanced was so popular.  I "ruined" my first game by simply grabbing a calculator and building a 'mech based upon the most efficient weapon grouping.  It was deemed "way too powerful" by the more experienced players in our group.

Another Emotional rating. I can't count the hours and number of people I pulled into this game just to have opponents. Love the Mecha, love the theme, love all the background stuff, and love love love to combat other mechs. What I really liked about this game was the damage system. You could get pounded and yet still be functional enough for some kind of combat. And there was always that guy with one leg and functional jump jets yelling "Death from above" and hurting himself more than his target. Fun times!

Battletech was my first miniatures game and will always be something special. It has been around for so long now and is largely unchanged - which means that the game system will very robust. If you like the novels, go and give this game a shot. The only downside I see is that larger games (more than a lance per player) can really take a long time but this can be addressed by using alternative rules provided by Catalyst.

4th edition owned.  What can you say?  It virtually BUILT an entire genre.  Base game plays alright, but the miniatures (not included) really add a lot.  The rules work...but don't necessarily make sense from a physics perspective.  Not really a problem, maybe, as the entire idea of walking machines being more efficient combat vehicles than compact tanks is a little bit of a stretch.  Definitely a game that bogged down under the weight of its expansions.

Battletech is an amazing game. I was introduced to it 7 years ago, and I've kept on playing since then. But it has its flaws, and it's indeed best played on-line, either with a client, or PBEM; I just feel that the "proper" boardgame takes very long, the players must take record of a lot of things, and the hours go by without the feel of having played something. Playing with computers or referees that do the "dirty" part makes the game experience a lot better.

I love this game, the only down sides being, finding people to play with and edition / era disputes. the game has been around so long that making mechs ends up being a question of what time period rather than what you want it to do. 
there is also the problem of Minis, most groups want you to have your own minis, and when you have almost all custom mechs that means building and painting them yourself most of the time.

Thats a little to time and money consuming for me so i play with the cardboard stand ups that come in the 1985 box. 

this game could easily consume my life if i let it.

Wish I'd gotten a chance to play this at Steve's...maybe some day! 

UPDATE

Purchased recently, and played a game with Katie. We both liked it and will definitely play it again. The Judge Dredd theme is awesome and it's really fun! Now to track down the expansions...

Interesting premise, but the mechanism is too fiddly and the balance doesn't feel quite right.  It could be turned into a more interesting game with /major/ tweaking.

I got this game many years ago together with the expansion. I played it a couple of times then, but later I have nor been able to re-read and deal with the fiddly rules and I decided to trade it away.

Hi, I have a second hand copy of the Block Mania game but unfortunately all the cards, the Rule Book and the Blocker's Manual are missing, which is most unfortunate!Is there a possibility of a pdf available of the Rules and Blockers Manual?

RATING: 6
Fun-ish old GW design that looks kinda ugly, yet beautiful in that GW nostalgic sort of way.  The game is clunky, and the buildings are far too weak so in both games I have played, the razing of the tenements was the path to victory.  I think more time needed to be spent putting out fires than spray painting windows...

RATING: 7
Need Mega Mania for real four player fun.  Typical GW tactic to not put the FULL game in a single package.  Regardless, it was a lot of fun to play and had that Judge Dredd background.  The end game is funny as the judges round up all the perps and restore law and order.  Unfortunately, sold long ago.  Repurchased here on the geek!  I'm geeked!

My friends and I must have owned every Games Workshop game there was when I was a kid! I remember playing this a couple of times.

Due to Games Workshop's recent decision to force BGG to remove most files supporting this and other GW games, I have removed my "4" ranking from this game. I no longer wish to contribute to the game's ranking here on BGG.

RATING: 7
Brick stupid.  Also loads of fun.  Much like another favorite around my group, Neuroshima Hex, it's really more about the experience of total chaos and beating up your friend's buildings than any tactical control you have, but the chain-reaction building collapses ensure that the experience is entertaining.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I'm one of those people that tends to fail to see the "Greatness" of older Games Workshop games.  I played this with a group of 4 people, only one of whom had played it before.  It took us all about 2 hours just to understand the rules, and the game itself was so ridiculously over-ruled it took another 2 hours just to finish the game, and that was with people intentionally trying to lose.  I wound up winning the game, and wasn't even remotely trying to.  Apparently something I did lit the building on fire, which resulted in about 10 straight minutes of rolling dice.*yawn*  I like the concept, but the game stinks.

First game I ever bought and still one of the best. There's nothing like trashing a shopping mall or taking fatties on mano-et-mano with a chainsaw, then watching your opponents block go up in flames.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I really want to like this but I just can't. The Command Point roll is way too much of a deciding factor. Over-ruled and with no real way of planning ahead. Weapons are allocated randomly and at equal cost and you might end up with a spray can or with a missile defence lazer. Guess which one is better...

Add complete random unit recruitment and utterly unbalanced cards to the mix and you've got yourself this disaster of a game. Play Neuroshima Hex instead.

Biggest let-down since the Judge Dredd movie. And that's something.

I haven't played it for years, but as I remember it's a really fun game. Like many old GW games, it has a great theme and components. It's an old game, so somewhat outdated with respect to player aids, length and elegance of the rules. A lot of luck also, but that's part of the fun. Mega Mania expansion (to play with more than 2 players) highly reccomended.

RATING: 7.5
The rules for this game are a bit on the heavly side, but if you can work your way through them, there's a really great game here.

The game is old, so of course the components are lacking and a bit fiddly, but it's worth it, because wreacking havoc on your opponents bloc/building is just awesome.

There's fires spreading, shit exploding everywhere, floors collapsing in a chain reaction, fighting, shooting, flying. It's just total chaos and pure fun.

The expansion is nice as well, as it adds the ability to play four players, plus some other little goodies.

I wasn't a big fan of Judge Dread, but this game is a blast. Literally!!!

RATING: 6
Fun game of block vs block warfare, but absolutely jinxed as far as I'm concerned. Somehow the dice make it virtually impossible for me to win this game... More so than any other game I've ever played. Witness:

"So, I need 7 or less on 5d6 for my entire building to collapse to the ground leaving me out of the game...."
*clatter*.... 
"Well lookeee what you got: four 1's and a 2!!!! *KERRRASSSHHH*..." 
"But I haven't even had my first turn yet, *Sob*"

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Presentation is sort of blah on this one, but the mechanics are wonderful, especially when things start collapsing. The rules are kind of dense so it takes a few plays to get "right" and the length is maybe a bit too much in 3+ player games, but definitely a winner.

Loads of counters, and loads of destruction.
All sorted, have even removed Happy Hour expansion - thank god for super shiny counters as those HH counters came right off.  Used MGs rules variant, made for a good close game will have to play again.

RATING: 7
Really cool game, oozes theme, can be subject to a fair amount of wacky luck. Guaranteed to make nice players turn nasty, new players can suffer badly if they are not suitably warned of certain dangers. This game is even better with the 4 player expansion - Mega Mania - although 4 can take a while to play, and theres a fair bit of downtime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Overlong wargame. Complicated rules for what it is. Some poorly thought out cards and not enough fire counters. However, it is also made of awesome, expecially when you completely rubble someone else's block.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid little game with a great deal of chaos to it.  Because the blocks (buildings) deteriorate once damaged, there is a natural time limit which comes into effect (after your block falls down, all you can do is cause damage with your remaining units to even out the score).  The expansion (Mega Mania) is a must as the game goes to a whole new level of chaos when played with 3 or 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I Have only played once but remember having a good time with it. I also remember having a lot of choices to make during the game. There is fighting and destruction on every turn. You can smash things, set fire to things, heck!, you can even just graffitti the other guys walls for points. I think it's a cool concept, having a game where the goal is to destroy a whole city block. I always wish I had bought the minis for it. Need to play this again.

RATING: 8
Own block mania, mega mania and happy hour.

Sure the rules can be fiddly, collapse and fire can be arduous, but the fun is immense!.

Owned it as a child, had a nostalgic longing for it so I bought it again and here I am, heavily into gaming 25 years later, my gateway game.

Could do with some house rules and tweaks to bring up to date but just brilliant fun. Nothing like having an errant enemy vibrodrill damaging your block with only your own rocket launcher to stop him=own goal total block collapse from the funniest structural damage cascade, not to be taken seriously for maximum pleasure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Based on some solitaire play. This game is a dice fest. Lots of luck. Surprised? Not really, it's pretty typical of this GW era. A good amount of atmosphere in there and some fun artwork (certainly of it's time). I'd love a game with an experienced player but don't have the will to work my way through the badly written rulebook again, let lone teach someone else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Unfortunately, although this captures the chaotic spirit of the Judge Dredd Block War world, this is one of those games where you have to re-read the (fairly long) rule book every time to remember the game mechanics & what every unit does - this does not make you tempted to dust it off & replay.

Great concept. Love the destruction. The problems arise in figuring out what all the pieces do. If I played it enough to memorize the rules it would be a lot of fun. But I've bored all my gaming friends enough with it that I doubt I'll ever be able to play it that much.

Have played this way to many times when it was first published. I can't count the number of times I managed to get my friends block to collapse. I'll gladly play a game again but it will have to be with like minded players and certainly not AP prone players.

A little random for some tastes maybe, but I never felt I wasted my time playing this one. There's something satisfying about setting off dynamite in an opposing block and watching it fall to the ground. 

Unfortunately this falls into the camp of 'Games that are damaged by the addition of White Dwarf expansion cards'. A peculiar trait of a number of their releases as I recall.

Owned this since it first came out. Played it dozens of times. Terrific fun when combined with Mega Mania (I always ran out of fire counters with the basic set). Can't say I have played it for 15 years, but that's because it needs an opponent to get the most out of it.

RATING: 9
A lovely game, with ingenious systems and a wonderful sense of destructive silliness about it, which makes it hugely enjoyable.  The cards, map and counters are all atmospheric, and the game-play is deep and well-balanced.  I would love to see a re-issue of this.  I suspect that it was not a big seller at the time, being too silly for wargamers and too complicated for non-wargamers.  But well worth buying if you ever see an old copy.

Kind of a cool idea.  Too neighbors get a bunch of freaks riled up against each other and try to blow the other guy's house up.  Meanwhile, the cops (Judges) gather more and more force to squelch it.  Not too bad a game, just a little out of my taste these days.  Just looking at this game makes me realize how many better options there are these days for games.  Remember when this sort of game was all you knew?

I really enjoy this game due to the fantastic block destruction system. Command points add a nice touch - you can't move all your units at once. (They're just militia.) Needs some rule clarification and you do need mega mania (the expansion) to get the most fun out of it. (Also forget the scrawling rules - they're boring.)

Light wargame of destruction. Do whatever you can to destroy the next block. Fun, but chaotic. Not for everyone. Mega Mania adds the 3rd and 4th players.

Bloc Wars and Judges.  What's not to like?  A rules tweak and a quality reissue are in order.

MIA, where have all my Dredd games gone??? Where is a Judge when you need one?

If you can find the right Judge Dredd/gaming fan to play with. This is tons of fun. Rolling to collapse the buildings is a hoot.

A golden oldie from my 1980's collection. Nostalgia prevents me from parting with it but will probably never get played again. Component quality of it's time. Fun theme though: two neighbouring tower blocks who's inhabitants have a war in the 2000AD Judge Dread universe.
A "Games Workshop" game back from when everything they did wasn't to sell minis.

My rose tinted glasses are firmly in place when playing this game. I have so much nostalgia for it, and other similar games of my childhood (such as Talisman).

The game is long, the rules are easy to read, but not the best reference, and the game is full of special powers, and little exceptions. That said, I still have a blast playing the game, even though it was a game made for another generation, for 1980's teens with unlimited play time.

Player Turns:
54 cards total, a set number is removed based on the number of players, and each player starts with three.
2 Players: 54-16-6=32, and 32/2=16 turns per player
3 Players: 54-12-9=33, and 33/3=11 turns per player
4 Players: 54-6-12=36, and 36/4=9 turns per player

House Rules:
1) Roll 3d6 and use the highest, and lowest results for your Command Points. (If you want a longer game with more action, then roll 3d6, and use the two highest dice results for your CP.)
2) Roll for Command Points at the end of your turn, in order to allow you to (have a chance to) plan out your turn ahead of time.
3) Allow an activated Blocker to switch Armory, and Hardware tokens with another Blocker for 1 Movement Point, this may also be used simply to give a Token to another Blocker. (Instead of just taking a Token, and having to throw out any Tokens above the Blocker's Strength rating.)

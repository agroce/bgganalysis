A fun game with the right group in which crazy battles are argued over. The game lacks a competitive feel, and does get repeative after awhile.

The replayability of social, judged card games is always limited (how many laughs can you get out of the glory hole card in CAH), but I suspect the combination of characters and modifiers here might give it more life.  I had a blast playing this one with a mixed group of gamers and laypeople

In the same vein as Cards Against Humanity; fun, but even more group dependent than it due to the quick thinking/creativity required as the cards won't just win by themselves.

Ever since I have entered the board gaming hobby a few years ago I have done so with the full knowledge that I am also entering a geeky comic-booky culture, something I have 0 interest in. I would rather hear someone talk about their colonoscopy than get into the nerd arguments that are pervasive in this culture.

I do like a reasonable debate (on things that actually matter), so I was up for at least an attempt at this "game".  I felt I had some pretty good arguments, but I also conceded when my creations weren't up to par. Unfortunately, the same delicate ego common among many who dwell in make-believe worlds makes for an inability to acquiesce. And then it became a contest of who was the loudest and most forceful, arguing about non-sensical things (my nightmare).

I will never play this game again in my life. I am reminded of a scene from the Simpsons....I think once of the Treehouse of Horror episodes. As Comic-book guy is talking to himself about why aquaman can't marry a woman without gills. As he sees a nuclear missile bearing down on him, he snaps out of his pretend world and says: "Oh, I've wasted my life". 

Thanks for your pre-death lucidity Comic Book Guy. I am not wasting my life either on this game.

A 'post cards against humanity' game. Same sort of feel but the humor predominantly comes from what people do with the cards as opposed to what is written on the cards. 

The 'house rules' in the back of the instruction booklet (speed dating, job interview) etc. can sometimes make this game even more hilarious.

I find it problematic at times because people vote for what they think would win based upon their own thoughts, as opposed to vote who they think would win based upon what the person arguing has actually stated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a fun game, nice conversations start from it. The rules are very vague. I think we had to set several house rules and limits to stop endless arguing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great party game alternative to the common black box game.  Sparks some super awesome and mega ridiculous conversations, and if you're not setting up a timer prepare for the conversation to go off the rails and go on forEVER.  The truly skilled out there will create some ridiculous scenarios and the endless number of expansions can shift the game into almost any refined version you'd like adding in settings, modifiers, specific challenges and more.  Unlike any other game out there it will leave you with jokes and conversations to talk about days after the game ends.

A better version of Apples to Apples, but still not my particular cup of tea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Feels like a combination of "Who Would Win" (obviously) with "But Wait, There's More!" or "Snake Oil".  Combatants are given an attribute and pitted against one another with each player arguing their case.  It's a fun game, and right up my daughter's alley, but another one where you really need the right crowd to make it hilarious.  
I do like the variants listed in the rulebook -- villian variant sounds interesting where opponents can lay negative attributes on eachother.  The purple deck also adds scenarios which can be fun.
Overall - fun game with the right crowd - don't let it overstay its welcome.

I don't like this game.  Don't think I'm not the audience for it, I am the friend who asks "Who would win in a fight?" all the time.

Nothing about this game works. There's too many card types, none of the jokes land or go above "lolrandum."  "Situation" cards which are supposed to make one sided fights more dynamic only contribute to more blandness.

I think this game doesn't work because "Who would win in a fight" is an activity built off of shared media experiences and friend group dynamics. Putting that in a commercial game only makes for boring and unrelateable situations. 

Asking your friends "Who would win in a fight?" 
is better than Superfight. Not having mechanics, and making up the story of the fight on the fly is better than this. Avoid.

A great step-up from the tired Cards Against Humanity, but I'd go slow on this one. It's a fun game because of its flexibility--you can change the prompts, change the format of the game, etc. But I burnt myself out by playing this too much. It's a good party game but I'd rather sit out than play.

Update: I'm not giving enough details here. This is going to be a perfect game for some people, just not for me. I've been a comic book geek my whole life, and my least favorite part about that culture are the pointless "who would win in a fight" discussions. That's what this game feels like. Definitely, there are going to be a few laughs because the combination possibilities can be humorous. Even leaving aside the Apples to Apples mechanism (which I am not a big fan of), It's just not my kind of game.

Superfight is party game of super powers and super problems.

The game is all about arguing with your friends about ridiculous fights.

The core deck contains 500 cards. 170 characters (white cards), and 330 powers and weaknesses (black cards). Players use a hand of three white cards and three black cards, and choose one of each to beat the player next to them. Then they get a random black card before fighting. Players then argue their case for why they should win, and the table votes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
You really have to play with extroverted people to get the full value of this game.  It relies heavily on the players debating why their created hero would win, and going over the top with their descriptions and examples.  Players who just present their hero with no exposition will get limited mileage from this game.

Superfight is a game that can be really fun with the right group.

With the wrong group, it's a screaming match that idiots will find humor in. The game itself is a clever concept, but once you have seen 2 people arguing for up to an hour and REFUSING to shut up, you see some real flaws. I wish the game included a sand timer by default so you have to get your argument across fast.

RATING: 5
My first play was with the Battle Royale rules, with one card passed to the left (black as an attribute, white as a sidekick), with the table vote loosely handled. That was okay, but having read the rules I much prefer the sound of the "normal" version, with one-on-one battles.

That seems like it'd include more roleplaying and wheedling, which sounds like fun.

Basically, I wanted it to be Funemployed and it isn't. Instead, it stops right before the best part of Funemployed, skips that part, and returns for a quick vote. Meh.

Like Cards Against Humanity, I laugh quite a bit playing Superfight, but I want more. Maybe the vanilla rules would provide that; I'd like to try it again that way to find out. But I suspect Funemployed would still win out.

This is barely a game, but I've had a great time with several groups with this.  I love that I can just start dealing out cards without explaining any rules at all and go.  I really just look at this as a catalyst for getting weird conversations and jokes going with a group.  I have a few of the expansion decks and it would be nice to be able to fit them all in one box, but I've gone through each to ditch a few duplicates and less-than-hilarious cards, whittling down to a box of finely honed hilarity.

I played this once and I remember being amazed at the concept. This was when I was studying abroad, and I remember writing a note to myself that I "must buy this" when I would return home. Then I got more into board gaming and thought: "How many times will this stay funny?" Still, it's something I definitely want to play again when it comes up again.

Like Cards Against Humanity but with almost an infinite number of different outcomes and some hilarious match-ups.  Instead of "shock value" this game uses twists to make the mighty weaker or stronger.  You have to play it, but it holds it's game replay-ability way longer then CAH.

It's good to use as an icebreaker in for a meetup, which is what we used it for, but I wouldn't want to play it outside of that.

Like Cards Against Humanity, this game lets uncreative people rely on cards as a crutch instead of thinking too much about things (we even had some people pick cards at random). It's fine every once in awhile, but I don't really get into these types of games anymore.

Not a game, but fun

:thumbsup: - Creates fun geek arguements

:thumbsdown: - Not seeing the locations and such after you pick is weak, as is the random additional card

My go-to party game. Anytime someone wants to pull out CAH (which I am pretty meh about), I recommend Superfight instead.

I loved the idea of this game however I did not find it to be too much fun.  Looking at the other opinions of this maybe I need to give it another shot with a different group of friends.

Super power themed social card game. Many variants, from randomly adding a power, to trying to use a sales pitch to convince the judge to pick you cards. Will require expansions in the future to prevent staleness.

I have only played this game once, but it had the four of us playing in stitches the whole time.  It is not something that I would play all the time, but it is certainly something that I see myself playing a lot more in the future.

I'm not a fan of games where "Arguing" is the main game mechanic. It was kind of funny, so I gave it a 2 instead of a 1.

This game is exactly as fun as the group you play it with... It can be a ball with players that get into the spirit of the game, it's a total dud for groups lacking interest and enthusiasm. It makes it hard to rate, frankly... you could probably just make as good a set with your own ideas and index cards though even if you find a group that embraces the idea... all in all, it doesn't feel worth 25 bucks to just skip using your own imagination, frankly.

Played a four player game and didn't have much fun. Luck of the initial first draw combined with hoping the last card drawn each round doesn't destroy the case for why your person should win. No thanks on playing this one again.

??? players.

Party game in the same way cards against humanity is.

Each turn two people draw 3 character cards and 3 modifier cards, then choose 1 of each to play as their team.
Then another random modifier is added to each and everyone votes on who they think will win.

Classics include:
Jackie chan in a flaming tutu
Cheetah with a jetpack
My mum riding Michael (;_;\)

I had higher hopes for this game, going off the recommendation that it was a Cards Against Humanity spirited card game.  This game only works well if you have friends who are passionate about arguing AND are good sports if their character loses.  Sometimes these two traits do not go hand in hand.  With that all said, this is a fantastic game for drunk people.

So stupid it's fun, and reminds me of the times in college when we played parcheesi mainly to have an excuse to argue loudly about the rules.  This is the same experience boiled down to just the argument part.

It's a super geeky game in the spirit of Apples to Apples, but the mechanic is a bit clunky and it's not as quick-firing as some of the others.  I'll have to play it some more to see if it's worth working out.

An interesting variant on Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity. Unfortunately, like those game, it also has very limited appeal for me. I find those games good for a few laughs but not something I ever want to play repeatedly. Once is enough for me.

+Happy Penguins

LIKE: I enjoyed the idea of buying, selling, and growing pigs. Simple rules, easy to explain. Very cute presentation.

DISLIKE: The game felt one-dimensional. The idea is to guess what others are NOT doing, but with 5 players felt too random. We played the simultaneous selection action, but not the tactical variant.

OVERALL: Although there was some challenge in the game, I was a bit disappointed. It's too light for me, not enough tension. I wish there was one more aspect to the game to add some depth.

A intresting pig farmer game. The "ammount of actions depends on how many took it"- mechanism works great. I think the simultaneous choosing of actions is more fun than in player order. Can't wait to see how much the game strategy changes with 6 people compared to 3.

This a great little economic game with a smidge of bluffing and deduction.
The balancing mechanic of making it so that for the more players trying to take the same action, the fewer actions are available makes for this interesting mind game of trying to make slightly sub-optimal plays just so that other players won't interfere with you.

Great fun, easy to teach, unique theme, I love it.

RATING: 8.4
Surprisingly solid for the game's subject matter, this is basically a light Euro-style game in which you're playing Action cards to receive benefits from Seasonal effects. Feed and vaccinate your pigs so they'll grow and survive, and make sure you've got the most money when Winter ends and you score. Art is cutesy and bright, but the game itself is a little deeper. Actually I'd recommend this as a gateway Economic/Euro game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game is tad bit deceiving. Looking at the short rule book and cutesy art, you probably will think this is a kid's game. But it's actually an economic engine-building game. Basically, players are trying to efficiently grow/breed/purchase/sell pigs as efficiently as possible, while taking advantage of the seasonal cards, which give bonuses each round. To do this, players must select actions which are in limited supply and that are divided up among the players. Thus, to do an action efficiently, one must pick one that is in poor demand. Furthermore, the game comes with a tactical-variant, which eliminates the simultaneous action-selection (less player-induced luck).

Overall, this is a game that I find more intriguing than anything else. My biggest issue with the game is it feels disjointed; it's a game whose economic/mathy nature warrants a more serious/competitive attitude. But at the same side, it's a game that you can't take too seriously because of the random elements (seasonal cards) and the ability for other players to mitigate your own decisions.

Silly game about raising pigs. Has a cool action selection mechanic - players that choose the same action have to split the number of actions between them.

I thought this might be a good introduction to role-selection games.

Played it with three, and it worked well.

UPDATE: We played it with six, and as suspected, it's a better game with more people. However, after a bad spring, it was evident that some people were out of the running. This game might suffer from a runaway leader.

I appreciated the simplicity of the rules and enjoyed trying to guess which actions my competitors were going to choose.

Wow!  Great instructions.  Fun artwork. Simple to teach.  Then... BAM, there is a LOT going on here. The game deserves many many play throughs to figure out the optimal play strategy.  This game is a bit like chess in that if you optimize your strategy you can destroy a lesser opponent. Once you get behind it is difficult to catch up.  Was one of the best surprise games. I tried it as a demo at The Games Keep in West Chester, thinking it would be a shallow game to play with my daughter, boy was I wrong.  Only gripe is it is a bit long but worth the time.

Vous avez l'âme d'un patron du CAC 40 ? Ce jeu est fait pour vous. Achetez des cochons, entassez-les dans votre ferme (tant pis si ils sont serrés), gavez-les d'OGM pour les faire grossir. Ou reproduisez-les pour augmenter le rendement. Piquez-les de tous les vaccins possibles et autres medocs douteux pour éviter la maladie (et ne pas perdre d'argent par mortalité de cochons). Puis vendez-les au prix fort pour en racheter d'autres au prix mini. Pas de scrupules. Tiens, j'irai bien m'acheter un p'tit cochon en pâte d'amande, moi...

Players compete on raising healthy pigs by executing strategic combinations of “Actions” (Feed, Mate, Purchase, and Sell) and “Tools” (Vaccines, Nutritional Supplements and Birth Amulets) for each round. Both the frequency to take these “Actions” and the number of “Tools” a player can purchase are restricted by the number of players choosing to take the same action in any given round. Also, from time to time there are unexpected events (such as Pig Shows and Sausage Fest) which offer players great opportunities to outperform their peers.
There are four rounds to each season, and all unvaccinated pigs die at each season change. The game concludes at the end of four seasons, when all pigs are sold off at different prices in accordance with their sizes. The player with the highest profit at the end wins the game.

This game does not play especially well with two players and is dreadful at 6 players. We have not played it with any other player counts yet. It is a light little euro style game that we bought mainly due to the cute farming theme. The one time we attempted to play it with six players was at our game group and we were teaching the game to the other 4 players as well so that may be why it didn't go over well. It took way too long and we ended up only playing half the game. We may try the tactical variant if we ever play it with higher player counts again.

I could take or leave Happy Pigs.  It's a decent intro economic game with a fun action-selection mechanism -- the number of actions you get to do depends on how many other players picked the same action. The more that did, the less you all get to do that action -- maybe 2-3 times. On the flip side, if you selected an action no one else did, you're likely getting to do that action 7-10 times. So the decision becomes "Do I do what I logically should do in this equation of raising pigs, or do I go slightly out of order to get off the bandwagon and benefit off more actions.

All that is good and fun in Happy Pigs, plus fun, cute artwork.

But, I think the game starts to overstay its welcome, and once you learn the bonus rewards on the seasons, you can start to plan things out a little more.  As one player noted, it'd be cool if the seasons and bonus rewards were separated so it could be a little more random. I also hate to see the same bonus show up twice in a game. Duplicate cards like that make me feel the designers failed to spend a little more time in coming up with some more unique and varied cards.

This has been a big hit with several people in my casual group, but I wonder if the simultaneous action selection isn't a good fit for this game. I think the winner will usually be the person who zigs when everyone else zags. I haven't tried it yet, but I think I will like the variant where players choose actions in turn order.

Very deceptive game. Simple rules, cutesy artwork and theme (though there is some darkness there if you want it with the vaccination free piggy being obliterated between seasons and what are you selling the pigs for again?). All this masks a heady economic game. So if your like and you like heavy games, but shorter playtimes are important and simple rules overheads are also then it's worth having a look at this. It's no power grid though. Oh and you get your moneys worth in cardboard with this one - I like it a lot. Oh and the Cathala produced two player variant is good, not as good as playing with three but its good. Good enough to warrant owning.

A game about pig farming, trying to raise your pigs and sell them for profit. The game uses a clever and simple mechanism where each in round, each of the four different actions (mating/feeding/shopping/selling) will be allocated a certain number of activation. 

Players then secretly choose their action and reveal them simultaneously. If you're the only player that picks a certain type of action, you get the full amount of activation. If multiple players pick the same action, they have to split the amount actions evenly among the players. In other words, you really don't want take an action similar to the other players. 

I love how simple the game is yet it provides enough strategy to keep you engaged. Very good production quality, which I think is a little overproduced.

I wish the publisher includes more varieties in the season card. Some are a little bit repetitive. The events can sometime go against you but I believe that what makes the game fun.

Playable with 6 players.

Don't let the cutesy art for this game trick ya, there is more meat to it than one might expect.  Happy Pigs is an action-selection game in which players manage their pig farms and grow their herds to sell for a profit.  Player with the most money at the end wins.  

The game is broken up into 4 seasons, with 4 rounds each season.  In each round, players will secretly choose between 1 of 4 actions: selling pigs, making purchases, feeding your pigs, or mating them.  Each round also has a special effect that either affects pricing during that round, or offers bonuses at the end of the round, thus influencing what you might want to do.  However, the caveat is the more players that choose the same action, the less effective it is.  So anticipating your opponents' moves based on what the needs of their farms are and the current bonuses available can help make your choices more efficient.  

Happy Pigs is a short game (under an hour) with a fairly unique theme.  It is easy to learn and offers enough meaningful choices to make it appealing to new/young and seasoned gamers alike.  Recommended.

2017-02-25 : First play of this action-selection game where the trick is to pick the actions the other players aren't doing, so it's all a game of out-guessing your opponents , getting into their Boyd decision cycle as it were. Decent enough game but maybe takes a tad too long for what it is and with all the components moving in and out of your board is a bit fiddly.

Fairly light game play and incredibly cutesy artwork in this one. 
The action sharing mechanic whereby actions are split evenly between all players choosing that action is really quite unique and I have not experienced any other games with this mechanic, making happy pigs interesting, however I am concerned that beyond the sharing mechanic there is not actually anything new ...or particularly rewarding here.

So far played it about 10 times and it seems a game people do enjoy. It is not a wow game, but it offers some debth once you know it. WHile playing with a 4 four player, it seems you are a bit more in control of what is going on, while a 6th player it really depends how everyone bets and that can affect allot on how it plays out. To fully grasp the game I would need a 3 plays with same group, but usually always few different people, but happily it is in my collection and play it from time to time.

Don`t judge by the cover. This is an excellent game. Really simple too learn, but a lot of depth in it. Use the advanced rules, where players choose their actions simultaneously without knowing what the other players has choosen, then reveal all at once. In this way the game gets more tactical, because you need to outthink your opponent and think carefully what you might choose.

Gift from Sam 3/16. So much cardboard! Thankfully the chits punched nicely. You have a field (which you can expand) and you buy pigs (or breed them from your existing pigs), and feed them to make them grow. The pace car of the game is the need for pigs to be vaccinated at season changes, or they die and are removed from your farm. So you can't grow more than you can vaccinate. Space is a concern, because while the first extra field is affordable, they get expensive, so you want to balance having enough space to be efficient in your actions versus spending too much for room you don't really need.

While this seems to be a light economic game, it is mostly a Vizzini-game with an economic aspect. Approaching it as an economic optimization game leads to deception, because the winner seems to be mostly determined by the outguessing.

RATING: 8.5
This is a solid economic game in which you are a pig farmer.
only four available actions to chose from.
The intersting thing about this is that you are allowed to repeat that action depending on how many other people took that action. the less the better.
the other interesting thing is that you have to vaccinate the pigs. if you don't they die if the season changes.

we probably play with open season cards so everybody can plan ahead.
this was rather good with 6.

edit after spellenweekend:
happy pigs is allways the game of the weekend of for me. The amount of gameplay it fits in 75 minutes is amazing.
A little bit high on luck. Next time I have to play with forecast. (next tile is known as well) this can prove an improvement as groupthink is something you want to avoid. But so does everyone .

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This isn't a bad filler that is filled with a bit of economy and trying to outguess what everyone else is going to do of the four action choices. Choose an action by yourself, get to do it a lot...choose an action someone else(s) do, get to do it quite a bit less. There is a bit of a spatial aspect to the game as the pigs grow after being fed and/or reproduce. I'd be happy to play again but I don't need to own.

My wife liked the game and so, after failing to get the last copy from the reluctant salesperson at Essen, finally got it from on online retailer from Germany.

What a fine little economic game with minimal rules.  The out-guessing is fun.  The random events a nice addition to the game to add some tough decisions.  Simple enough for my son to play but engaging enough for the regular gaming guys.  Didn't overstay its welcome, either.  I imagine it is better with four or more players, though.

Lovely. The Swan Panasia version has some pretty interesting art, but I think I like the cubical pigs better. In any case, this is a charming little pig-raising game.

Here is a game for when you have a family with a few gaming children.  I think you want at least 4 players and you want a younger audience of gaming kids.  The market mechanisms of the game are great and interesting to play with.  There are hard choices to make and divergent paths to pursue.  You also need to pay attention to what the other players are doing.  It's all very well done.  But the whole game is presented in package that firmly makes it a game for children.  

If you are looking for a 2-player/3-player game like this with a child, I suggest Broom Service.  With only adults, try Glass Road.

Don't be fooled by Happy Pigs cutesy appearance, here lies an economic game and a pretty pure one too. Plays have just 16 rounds to amass as much money as they can by buying feeding and rearing pigs. There is a clever action system that limits how many actions you can take - maybe... great game.

Happy Pigs is a great game with very nice artwork, and solid pieces and components. After playing this game several times with 2, 3 and 4 players. I found that the game strategy:enjoyment ratio is best with four players and increases with more players.

I'm not sure who this game is for. On one hand, it's light enough that kids can play, and the artwork is very cute. On the other hand, it's very mathy and the random events can throw things for a loop. Iello continues their streak of lousy games...

My first play through was great! I enjoy planning out my moves and attempting to anticipate what the other player(s) will do. I played the 2 player variant, which was fun. I'm also excited to play with more players and the two strategic variants.

update: After 5 plays in two days... my girlfriend is much better than I am at this game.

I'm not à big fan of scheduling games. The variation of the game is better : like the first player choose his action, then the second one,... Like that there is more strategy than randomness. It is not really ethic to feed again and again the pigs and use drugs on them.

RATING: 7
Solid economic game. Really easy to teach,  quick to play, pretty cute, but the sharing actions can keep this game a little random and can sometimes deny risky play or plans that you imagined could make work.

I am a fan of economic games, and I think this really is an economic game in the purest sense. The person with the most money wins, and you get money specifically form focusing on pig farming.

The special bonuses that each season gives were a downside, in my opinion. Having small objectives to keep the game from being a linear grind is nice, but the other players are generally either too close or too far from the objective to make it worth working for, and if you're one of the few that aren't achieving the objective, most others are going to try to go for it, so it's a waste of time.

Looks super cute, but there is a very interesting ecnomic game in there. 
I think I personally enjoy the tactical variant more, but I think the blind bidding version works a bit better for some of my friends that overcalculate things as they can be less sure what they are going to get.

I love the components, and the action point system with the advanced variant that we played.  I don't know how many different paths to victory you can realistically have, but I enjoyed how the game felt light but had meaningful choices.  I also like being able to plan and this game allows for that as well.

This is a pretty fun game. I have played it a few times now and the second time was great. It is a buy low grow big and sell high kind of game. Simultaneous action selection and you want to pick the best option for you and try not to match any other player. It is a mind game and I love that. It has a lot of great features and plays up to 6!! Fast game and super fun I will be looking to add this to my collection. Very cool game.

Problems with being too random, too solitary and too obvious. Selection process is the core interaction (rest is just solitary upkeep), and sometimes it works fine and creates interesting decisions and results. But on many events it will be obvious that one player will benefit greatly by taking a specific action, even if there are 3-4 others who take the same. The others will know that player will take that action, have no incentivize to take it themselves, and will lose both if they do and if they don't.

Played this swine farming title from Iello new to us called Happy Pigs. It's a bit fiddly at times trying to figure how many actions you have each turn, but otherwise some quite fun mechanics and the artwork is adorable, esp for my tweenage girls. I own expansions that lets you feed, breed, buy and sell cows, chickens, penguins and sheep. Great one for families, but also some decent strategic depth for more serious gamers. Time for making bacon!

RATING: 6
A cute and cutthroat simultaneous action selection game about managing a pig farm. Each round, players secretly choose to buy items, breed pigs, feed them or sell them off. However, there is only a limited number of action points for each action, so players who select the same action have to divide the action points among themselves.

Beneath the tongue-in-cheek graphics is a simple economic game with an elegant (and [i]brutal[/i]) way of penalising clashes. The random events are a bit hit-and-miss and can really sting if you have inadvertently taken the wrong sequence of actions. The game can also last surprisingly long for its weight (~1 hour) when playing with gamers.

This game has some [i]really[/i] cute illustrations. To me, they suggest a young target audience but this is actually an economic game: buy pigs and equipment (cheaply), feed and breed them, then sell them for cash (hopefully more than you spent!). It's certainly not a heavy game but there are definitely some decisions to make (which action to choose each turn -- in the 2er variant, one player can stymie their opponent by correctly guessing their choice; what to buy; when to sell). You can, however, benefit from random chance: there are 4 seasons, each with 4 rounds and events (altering market prices, giving cash rewards for having specific inventory). The events might just happen to benefit one player more so than the others. 

Not a bad game, really. I just wonder about the intended audience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
The problem that after the first rounds you need just 2 actions to win: Feed and Purchase. Sometimes sell for the money, but it's better not to sell the pigs to get big bonuses on the event cards. Maybe with more interesting (and less repetitive) event cards the game could be more interesting, but for now it's monotone. We should try the advanced gameplay.

Game looks great, it is family friendly and there is even some strategy in there to satisfy the gamer in me. The text in the game is open information so can be read out and explained to the kids without them having to read. Variations on game environment being brought by cards make this a replayable game. And the theme definitely helps breaking this out to the table.

VERY interested in this game as a family game.

RATING: 6.4
tl;dr: enjoyable but shallow

Get some pigs, feed them to grow and vaccinate them to keep them alive. There is some space management and managing your money (having the most of it is the goal) add some challenges to this pretty basic game.
We all enjoyed playing this, but replay value is pretty low.
We also found 4 an unfortunate number. There are 4 rounds per season, so the same player will be start player in every last round of the season. Being start player is not good so in this game, so I would suggest playing with 3 or maybe 5.

I was at BBGCON Spring 2016 and wanted to play this but couldn't find it. I finally thought to check the kids games and there it was. 

This is not a kids game. The artwork makes it look like one but it's not. 

It is a medium level economic game about raising pigs and selling them at market. 

Very fun and engaging and the artwork is really amazing despite being cartoony.

This is a simple economic game with limited choices.  The main point of the game is not to take the same actions as other players.  I enjoyed it, but there isn't a lot of meat here (pun).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There's a lot to like here and a little bit to not like.
First off, play with the advanced rules (players show their action tiles one at a time in turn order, and always show the season card for the next round). With the standard action tile rule the game would be a lot more chaotic, with potential rounds where everybody gets set back because they try to do the same action. With the advanced rule, there's a lot more strategy around which action tile to pick. The season card rule is needed because some of them (have one pig of each size, have the most small pigs) can take a round of planning to really maximize their benefit. Without knowing that they're coming, they can just randomly reward the player who happened to meet the criteria.

Onto the gameplay. The action tile mechanic and the shared number of actions mechanic are both really nice. Each round there is a card that dictates how many times a certain action can be taken. If multiple people choose that action, they split it evenly. So the more people who choose a single action the fewer times they get to take that action. I don't know of another game that uses that exact mechanic. The action tiles themselves keep the game simple. You can do four different actions, pick one.

My only concern with the gameplay so far is that it could possibly become repetitive with multiple plays. The season cards will be different and in a different order, but the basic strategies don't change much and there aren't many different paths to victory. Buy (or birth) small pigs, grow them into more valuable larger pigs, sell them. This is a bit of a double-edged sword because I love the simplicity of it, but it's almost too simple.

There are a couple of production decisions that could have been improved. When looking across the table it's not so easy to see what size pigs your opponents have because they're pretty similar. They could have added an icon or a number to help distinguish the pig sizes. Sometimes your competing with an opponent to get a bonus from one of the season cards (most small pigs, most big pigs, etc) and you need to be able to easily tell what your opponents have.

The action tiles could also use a slight update. Two of them (sell pigs, breed pigs) use the same pig picture but in a different context. Sometimes you pick the wrong action tile because it's easy to confuse those two tiles. They should have used totally unique art on each tile.

My last issue is simply cosmetic so it's not too big of a strike against the game. The promo tiles (I have the penguins) are merely cosmetic and just replace the pigs. I wish the promo animals had some sort of unique attributes and it seems like a waste to make a promo that doesn't change anything. The game is simple enough that adding some small change through a promo could only be an improvement.

I want to love this game but as it stands, I like the game. It's light and it has some fun mechanics and it lasts the right amount of time. I'm just not sure how many more plays I'll see unless an expansion comes along to help mix it up a little.

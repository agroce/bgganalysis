Tough game to enjoy sometimes as everything that you want is generally bought before you get a chance to buy it, and the attacks can be incredibly painful.

This is a fast and fun deck builder with a B-Picture horror theme. 
There are different solo variants in the forum.

I play it like this (thanks to Bill Perks) --> Preparation: Only 2 Training Cards of every resource are available to purchase during the entire game. / Sequence of Play: 1) Roll the omen die for each minion in the line as the first action of each turn (even if it is for the same minion that remained from the turn(s) before). Do not do this on the first turn. 2) For each skull rolled, draw a card from the main deck and place it in the Shadows. 3) Play with a single character, buying, fighting, etc., per the normal rules including the strike rule. 4) Replace the purchased cards in the center line as normal. 5) Roll 2D6 and discard the corresponding cards numbered left to right e.g, on a roll of "2" & "5" discard the 2nd and 5th card in the center line. If the same number is rolled, only remove one card. 6) Replace the card(s) discarded. / Exceptions: The Hungry Dead cannot kill Minions in the Center row. / Winning: Win if the 3 Villains are defeated before there are 10 cards in the Shadows or the main deck runs out.

This one might be our favorite deck builder. It plays essentially like Ascension but with theme and without the terrible artwork. say what you want about the costumed characters in photo on the cards but that is really awesome, we don't care what you say! We have been having tons of fun with this game and will continue to do so in the future. As well as looking forward to all the expansions.

Es un juego r치pido de montar y muy f치cil de jugar. Ideal para sacar cuando no se dispone de mucho tiempo para un juego m치s "pesado".

Pese a tratarse de un deckbuilding casi todas sus cartas son diferentes. Eso le le da un mont칩n de rejugabilidad y variedad a las partidas.

I wasn't originally going to pick this up, but I enjoy the Touch of Evil board game so much that I inevitably caved, and I am happy I did. Very tight deck builder that really captures the spirit of the longer board game. Some of the art is reused, and mostly the same villains and characters, but the card quality here is actually better than several of the Flying Frog board games I own. Very impressed, think DC Deck Builder with a few variations, and the number of Villains and Heroes will ensure you get a lot of play out of just this set. Even has a die element.

DBG with ATOE theme.  Great insert but I had to sleeve the cards because some had a rough grainy texture and I think other cards had unstable printing.  I don't know why FFP has so much trouble with cards.  Because of the sleeved, cards, they fit in very tight and take up the whole box.

RATING: 8
A relatively simple Ascension-style deck-builder with some valuable additions, such as character cards, a wild resource, and the omen die. The greatest value that this game provides is its unique theme, being wholly based upon the gothic horror world of "A Touch of Evil". I enjoy the game considerably -- it's an easy way to access this theme in a tabletop format, whether solo or with friends/family. It's particular brand of horror is deliciously spooky!

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: This deck-building game's theme is set in the world of A Touch of Evil. The artwork and terms (Dark Secret, Ally, Minion, ..) seem to be pulled directly from the parent boardgame. The card titles are thematic and the photo-quality artwork maintain the period feel. The gameplay involves obtaining attributes, training, gear, and allies in order to defeat minions and 3 big bosses. The inclusions of global events when a card is revealed introduces a bit of random chaos. My one gripe would be all the decks that have to be managed throughout the game. Shadow Deck, Crypt deck, ... there's a fair amount of card management involved in running the game system. Overall this is a fun horror deckbuilder.

Went into my first game of this expecting the same old deck builder.  I am so glad I played it out because this game is a true GEM in the sea of repetitive deck builders.

Deckbuilding meets A Touch of Evil.

Having never played the original A Touch of Evil, I can only judge this game purely on the deckbuilding gameplay. I don't mind the card art. This probably plays best at 3-4 instead of the max number of players due to downtime.

Pros: Cool horror semi-cooperative deckbuilding game. Straightforward gameplay.

Cons: Card quality (inconsistent cut and edge peeling). Missing a rule clarification in rule book.

Cool deckbuilding game where you manage 3 resources. My only concern is the amount of replayability when it comes to the villain cards.

Can be a bit long as players can draw so many cards, and can use them in so many ways. Nevertheless a very interesting game.
I especially like the way that you can nearly always clean out your deck, if you cannot do anything better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I am always a fan of deckbuilders and this one is no exception. As is typical in games of this ilk, you use the resources on cards you draw to get better resources and score points along the way as well. Eventually, you will have enough resources to take on the boss, which provides a lot of points. This can be a cooperative effort or played competitively for points (which I generally prefer). Both methods actually work quite well here though; neither mode seems to simply be an afterthought in the rules.

One of my favorite aspects is the starting player powers and decks. Everyone's balance of starting cards is a little different and coupled with the abilities each player is led towards a different strategy. 

It's more of a narrative experience than a true engine builder, but just because it's not as tournament-ready as something like Dominion doesn't mean you can't have just as much fun with it. 

The cards themselves are a bit flimsy and prone to small tears. The box itself is useless for storage, but the expansion box fixes this nicely.

Ascension rip-off.

I like new twists like 3 fixed monsters to defeat (to advance & end the game), dark secret cards, a lingering possibility of getting rid of card(s) every turn and even the shadow deck (an attempt - if totally failed - to introduce a cooperative aspect).

Very preliminary rating as I'm not sure I've liked the game _that_ much less than Ascension.  I would need to play more to give a final verdict.

I will reiterate: the cooperative aspect is almost non-existent.  Everybody just maximizes their VPs not caring about the common defeat as it is just unlikely...

Flying Frog takes the standard mechanics of deck building against set targets but twists it by making three different power types like A Touch Of Evil. As Touch Of Evil games go, the pieces are there but the theme doesn't quite come through the play; as deck builders go, though, it's a better challenge and definitely enjoyable... especially since the game can beat you all.

PLUS: harder deck building
MINUS: series doesn't come through as much as the board game

RATING: 3
My god this was worse than Marvel Legendary. Graphic design was working against usability, you cant fan your cards and see what you have. Not a lot of theme, but I guess it has that in common with most deckbuilders. Too many types of resources for the randomness of both the center pile and the main bosses.At least it didnt take too long. I liked the pictures on the cards (as with all FFP games) and that each hero has special abilities

The deck-building mechanism is nearly identical to 'Clank!', but then again, all deck-building mechanisms are similar.  Dark Gothic captures the feel of the board game very well.  We found that the villains were very challenging and the game play quick, and intuitive.  I hope FFP continues to support this line.

RATING: 6
Essentially you have a hand of 6 cards and each turn you have a choice between 10 cards available to "buy" (6 enemies and things, 1 big baddie, and 3 upgrade cards) with them.  It's really pretty simple.  I've played once and didn't come close to winning (you really have to focus in on winning/beating/buying the big baddie i.e. villains to win the game), but I got the rules (that I needed to play) down easily and quickly, and if I ever play it again I'll be able to focus on strategy.  It's a light game with a fun, fighting horror monsters theme.

RATING: 8
This game is actually pretty fun. It's way better than the parent board game, and perhaps the best game Flying Frog has ever done. It's essentially a clone of Ascension or the DC Deck Builder, but it has some cool things going on that fit the theme. There are Dark Secret cards that can cause potentially bad things to happen to you. There are also three major villains you must fight, and they can win if they acquire 10 cards into a shadow pile. You play the game either cooperatively or competitively, but it mostly works out the same way. The one major downside I have with this game is that it can be a bit of a slog, mostly because there are three currencies you have to balance. Defeating the basic minion card thins out your deck, which is useful, but otherwise it's very easy for your deck to bloat up. I think this is my favorite of all the deck builders that utilize a card row, aside from Legendary anyway. There are a lot of dynamic things going on with the cards, and everything works together super thematically.

A deck builder about taking down gothic monsters by putting together the right resources before anyone else. I like the race to slay the monster, and the mix of three resources is interesting but maybe too random and mathsy as compared to the two resource system of Ascension. Really I think the problem is that too many of the cards to purchase are just straight up worse than the basic cards, which clogs the market. Still a good diversion for when we need a break from Ascension.

Card only game of ATOE with much of the same artwork and theme. Here you need to build up a deck by using the cards you have to defeat minions or solve mysteries, thus adding them to your cards for later use. Defeating the three Villians goes along way toward victory, and when they are all gone the players add up the VPs on their cards to determine who did the most to beat them, and thus win the game.

It's just Ascension with a third form of currency. Has all the same problems that Ascension does. The die rolling doesn't add much value to the game except make it even harder to plan out your turn beforehand. Too much downtime and not much more enjoyable when it gets to your turn. Hard to resist the allure of staring down at your phone during the game.

Love it 
But the "Semi-CoOp" is not really CoOp, it is VS.
If you play fully CoOp, it is another feeling, people take parts for what they do, for example one takes care to defeat the minions, f.e. with a balanced deck to use the "hungry dead" often as possible.

Cause of this game, I sell my complete ascension stuff, cause I will never play this again, cause I have ATOE: DG!

RATING: N/A
Purchased at ECCC after a demo. Still hate the artwork of Touch of Evil (so cheesy!!), but the gameplay was fun enough...

Skip to finally playing it at home. Terrible as a two-player co-op, which they say it can be, as too many cards have you trying to choose a benefit for yourself while screwing others. In a co-op you obviously want to work together and not against each other. It was unbalanced and weak at a two player count, and there were some rules/conditions that really seemed out of whack. I think it could have benefitted from more playtesting before release.

Pretty much only play this co-op with an additional rule or two (the variant rules listed with the game for cooperative play are broken as is; one of the additional rules we added was made official with the expansion; the other rule we added is that you always roll for the Hungry Dead in addition to any monsters in the center line and add a random card from the main deck to the Shadows if the Hungry Dead roll comes up skull). 

It's not my favorite co-op deck builder, but it's easily the quickest - especially if I'm the one rolling for monsters to the Shadows.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Feels very similar to the DC Deckbuilder, except the theme actually makes sense here. Easy to learn straight out of the book, though a better flow of play summary would have been slightly useful. The Shadow Pool mechanism is highly underused in the base game. I can already think of house rules to make that more interesting. There is a cooperative game variant included that could probably be played solitaire without any issues. The art is standard FFP quality Photoshop with nothing standing out as especially ugly except the Gremians card that I can't look directly at.

Provisional rating, one play. Prefer deckbuilders with free choice of purchase rather than a random card selection, especially when they bear small, indistinct text. Didn't feel there was enough combo opportunity, and did feed some of the attach powers were too strong (given that perhaps only one person had had the chance to purchase).  Art and theme did nothing for me. Nonetheless, would play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nothing new here, except maybe the asymmetric starting decks, which is a neat idea. Otherwise, it's just an Ascension clone, with much better art. (Assuming you like FFP's campy photographs, which I do.) Folks that like firing off massive combos will find a lot to like here as well, as it's not uncommon to play ten or eleven cards at a time as you get deeper into the game.

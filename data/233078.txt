RATING: 8.5
Brilliantly done game. Art is always enjoyable to look at. The lore added a lot of atmosphere to the game. The rules also brought a ton of interesting mechanics and hilarious negotiation to the game. I still love thinking about what happened and discussing it with my friends. Even though it is really long, especially with new players, I would definitely play again.

RATING: 9
Amazing game. Only downside is still the game length compared to similar games (Eclipse, Exodus), but the extra time is well worth it if you can manage it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very fun game, but the game length is a double edged sword. It's cool to have such an epic game that players commit their day to, but this can make the endgame feel quite anticlimactic. In addition, if a player loses a major space battle in the midgame, he is essentially stuck playing a game he cannot win for 4 more hours.

RATING: 6
Trying to sort out how I feel about this game.

Negatives include :

-There is way too much luck for such a long game (combat, secret objectives, action cards, etc.).
-Many of the objectives are uninteresting or thematically irrelevant.
-The battle system is uninteresting, with lots of dice rolling.
-DOWN TIME.
-Kingmaking and bash the leader.
-Lots and lots of cards everywhere.  It's impossible to keep track of what everyone can do and has upgraded.
-The game isn't too difficult to learn, but lots of small rules to keep track of.

With all of those negatives, the game has its fun elements.  The allocation system for your tokens is quite interesting.  It is fun to build up your empire, advance your techs and look for clever plays to score points.  The game has the potential to create lasting gaming moments/memories and I enjoyed some of the diplomatic elements.  Overall, I think I prefer Eclipse (only played it once and need to play it again).  It seemed to offer all of the positives without as many of the negatives.  I'm glad I got to play this beast of a game once (twice if you include 3rd edition) and I'd play it again...but there are many other, shorter games I prefer.

RATING: 9.7
After playing Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game and Eclipse, I was curious what other 4X games are out there and so I watched the review by "Shut Up and Sit Down" for Twilight Imperium 4th Edition. I realized that this game is not all about exterminating your opponents! I love the different objective cards to score points. I also like the player interaction: the voting for laws in the agenda phase, giving other players promissory cards, etc. It is a complex game, but it is still pretty streamlined. The rules are very good, only a few minor, unclear passages. The game works good with 4 players - you do not have to play with 5 or 6 players. And yes, it is a long game, but you are engaged all the time!

Players: 3-6 (best: 4-6)

Very very good game. Similar to base game of 3rd edition with balance problems fixed. A couple of negatives preventing it from getting a 10: 
Only 6 players
Distant suns is needed to make beginning of game more interesting and not just about grabbing planets as quickly as possible.
Needs more aggressive public objectives to avoid possibility of turtling.
Missing the diversity of 3rd with all expansions.

Still a very very good game.

The revisions to the rule set are very well done.  This is the definitive version, and it plays substantially quicker. This game has it all: negotiation, war, economics, politics, and drama.  It uses area control, role selection, asymetrical powers, hand management, action points, and auction/voting. It's truly epic, but there's almost no down time because you're almost always involved during other players turns.

Be advised: this is not a war game.

RATING: 5
For me, much better than 3rd edition. But I still think it has problems that just aren't really fixable. It's still long without a ton of decisions, even though the decisions you do make have tons of repercussions that tend to be pretty unpredictable. What's also weird about it is that it looks like an area control game, but it really isn't. Controlling planets is necessary to have resources to get some stuff done, but as long as you are scoring points it doesn't matter that much, and the things required for points are rarely associated with area control (e.g. have 2 techs of two different colors, spend 3 command counters, spend 10 trade goods, etc etc). Imperial makes it possible to come back somewhat,  but because you can only score one public and private objective per turn, it can be extremely hard to come back from a deficit. Which is fine, I don't particularly mind games that you can lose, but when it's so long it ends up feeling a bit kingmakery when you are in a hopeless position (although I will note that 4th ed is greatly sped up compared to 3rd edition, our 5p game with mostly vets was 5 hrs to 10 points). I'm sure this sort of changes with experience, but I'm just not really willing to spend the time to get good at this game, when there are others out there that are shorter and amazing. I have friends that LOVE this game, and I can appreciate their position, but it's just not ultimately for me.

Everything a board gamer could want in one box. Evry turn is exiting, as there are sooo many possibilities to choose from, and sooo much you want to do!
The 17 races makes the experience even better. Lots of replayability. 
Best with 4 players, otherwise it takes too long, and nobody gets to build war suns.

RATING: 6
12/27/17: I don’t want to give this a 7 rating because there are far too many 7s in my collection.  For me a 6 rating means “enjoyable in the right circumstances,” and so that’s where I’m going to put it.  I suspect that if I was willing to dedicate the time to playing this regularly my rating of it would improve, but I’m not that interested in investing the time.  There are a bunch of other long games that I’d rather be playing.  If you aren’t thrilled with TI3, you aren’t going to be overjoyed with TI4.

It’s 3x rather than 4x.  I’m not certain how you could do 4x without losing some of the balance, perhaps the inevitable outer ring expansion.  The game that this will always be compared to is Eclipse, and for me I’m much happier to be playing Eclipse though it really is soulless in comparison.

TI4 clearly shows an incremental improvement over TI3. The graphics and usability have been cleaned up and improved.  Also some of the dumb or bad cards from TI3 have been removed. Like TI3, you need to be planning on how to make one advancement per turn happen to stay in the game. 

The Tech was redone, and will take a little bit of getting used to.  I suspect for me that there is going to be a dominant strategy or best approach to the tech tree, minimizing variation over multiple games.

I don't think that we undestand how to optimize the trading game.  For us it was mostly ignored or tacked on to whatever else we were trying to do..

The days of the FFG coffin box are gone, but this is still a huge game box.  This is a total nit, but because the box is squarer, you get less of a landscape on the cover.  We compared the covers, and I actually like the cover of TI3 better.

I think that the part that I dislike most is the senate, but that’s me, I generally like games where the outcome can be better determined.  The senate is where you will spend about ½ of your game time immersed in.  We used a whiteboard to tally votes during the senate session and to show game order during the turn play.  I hate to think of what the game would have been without that.  Other players with more experience felt that the senate phase was an improvement over TI3.

The rule of thumb that you should plan on 90 minutes per player still holds true, so you need to dedicate an entire day to this.  It plays well with 5, there are mechanics to compensate the guy that gets crowded into a corner.  Like Eclipse this ends just when it feels like it is gearing up for something cataclysmic, so judging the timing is key.  One thing that I like about it is that you take one move at a time, so there isn’t a lot of downtime while you are waiting for your turn to come around again.

That said, the game creates a great story arc, and when I play, I get to spend the day with a great group of friends.

My previous experience
I have previously owned and played TI3 a handfull of times and I had mixed feelings about it. There were so many little things in the base version that I didn't like. Sure most where later fixed with the expansions. In TI4 you get a definitive version of everything.

Why TI4 is better
TI4 is just a much better game because it fixes all issues I had with TI3 and streamlines a lot. I like the new strategy cards, how trading works, the overhauled technology tree. I didn't like Distant Suns or the Leaders so I don't miss them at all.

More stuff I like
I like getting the 17 races with 2 racial techs, the flagships and promissory notes in the box. The new insert isn't perfect but at least it is usable. The public and secret objectives also breaks up the traditional turtleing. And finally, I personally think the new artwork is fantastic and looks way more modern.

What I don't like
TI4 is streamlined but it is still a game that takes a long time to play and has a lot of rules that can be quite complicated for new players. Once you get into the second half of the game it will start to feel more and more like a slog.

Not for everybody
TI has never been a game for everybody and TI4 doesn't change that. It's still a long epic space war game where you roll dice to decide the outcome of battles and the luck of card draws has an impact on the game. It is still a game that will likely take a whole day and is difficult to get to the table.

Conclusion
For me personally, I like this version and I will keep it and try to get it to the table more often. It is the best epic space experience out there. And I think it's worth the money, if it's the type of game you like.

Absolutely amazing game. Nothing else even comes close to replicating the experience of TI. Overall, the rules are an improvement over TI3, though I do miss some of the features from the expansions. I'm extremely confident that we'll see at least 1-2 expansions for TI4, though, so it's just a matter of time before that issue is resolved.
Side note - I have no idea why everyone keeps saying the trade rules are confusing, it's just "I'll give you two of my commodities for two of yours, okay?" "Okay." That's it.

Great wargame with lots of interesting choices, only downside is the insanely long playing time, and some unbalanced victory point cards. Politics phase can take up too much time. Technology of other players can be hard to keep track of. Hm that's a lot of downsides...

RATING: 9.5
After five years since my last play of third edition, I decided the playgroup needed a space themed game. And as a sucker for art and lore, I got a copy of fourth edition with the super sweet deluxe rulebook. Played a three player game, and after a bit of relearning rockyness and videos, we were underway. I took an early lead, gunning ahead in round one for Mecatol Rex to turn on my turtles ability (which, unfortunately, didn't get used much) gaining a few early points withImperial spam before fleets began closing in and abandoning the seat of power to the humans as the space lions gathered power. Mecatol remained in the human hands for the remainder of the game after a fleet build up created a great stare down and I siply claiming Imperial each turn to keep the humans from scoring.  Once tier two of objectives became available, I plotted my path to victory. I moved a small fleet along the edge of the map claiming planets to get two objectives lined up, buying time before activating Imperial to score to 8, holding on, mearly needing to not somehow getting wiped out in order to score the final two points. No blood was spilled that game. Only one true attack was launched, to be beaten back by turtle tech. Hopefully this game can become a monthly, at least, occurence. And hopefully to a point of speedy and truly crisp play amongst friends.

Conceptually the ultimate "space opera in a box" is something I've long looked at as something that might be "the best game ever" but was unsure if I would ever actually play something as long and involved as TI much. But after reading the rules for the fourth edition I decided it was finally time to take the plunge! Long story short: I still  have those concerns, but I'm glad to have it in the collection. The game certainly has great presentation, all the art and plastic bits are great (although the card stock is a bit thinner than I'd like for a game this opulent), and like most of Fantasy Flights epic games creates some really memorable story moments. Once borders are established and there's more interaction with your neighbors the game gets really interesting. And I really like how quickly the combat goes, keeps it simple, and while it might be a bit ridiculous how much plastic is covering the board at times it's fun to see big battles go down after the long buildup. 

But: the game really is LONG, like impractically so. Yeah veterans will be able to cut down the time a lot, but the sheer amount of components to keep track of means turns are pretty long regardless. While I admire the game in prog-rock, "sometimes more IS more" kind of way, the game isn't exactly nimble, and it can take awhile to get to the high points, to the point even someone like me whose tastes generally likes this sort of stuff finds it a bit much. Add in the fact you really need 5+ players to really see it shine in terms of player interaction, which might take all weekend, and boy it's a tough proposition to get to the table.

All that said, there's a lot of fun to be had with it: I love the lore, I love pushing around all the plastic, gobbling systems and building up fleets to strike at the right moment. I came in with really high expectations, and while for now I don't think it's a 10, my opinion might change with more plays. In the end I still prefer TI's younger sibling Runewars which has many similar mechanisms while slimmer in ways that lend to better pacing and plays better with lower player counts. But if I'm ever itching for some good ol' space opera TI will scratch that itch (and then some).

I think it's incredibly cool how well the races are thought out, the backstory the theme, etc. The gameplay just isn't for me. Just play a video game. For a board game, I'd take Race For The Galaxy any day over this. That said, I find it neat and highly respect the amount of work that went into it's design. It maybe needed to come with binders for it's tech trees though.

I like 4X games in theory and there's a lot to enjoy about the experience of playing Twilight Imperium, but it seems like there's a lot of fiddly details to learn in order to make good tactical decisions in the game, and I can't see myself ever playing this regularly enough to learn them, unlike a lot of other fiddly FFG games that I like and have enjoyed getting to know. Fourth edition seems like an improvement over third so far.

RATING: 10
Will always be my favorite game. Something about 6+ hours at the table executing a grand strategy really gets me going.

My gaming group was heavily invested in TI:3, with all expansions as well as the Shattered Ascension add on/rule tweaks. We eventually got it down to a set of strat cards and house rules that made the game feel its best. This took us 3+ years of fiddling with the mechanics of 3rd edition. After all that time, we were dialed. Probably got the game on the table 1x per month, with some periods where we were playing 2x a month.

After seeing TI:4 news, my group was very excited but also a little hesitant. After playing 3 games, it is clear that TI:4 is a very well designed game. The guys t FFG took their baby and made it a little more streamlined. It is still a beast of a game, but less weird ambiguity with how the rules are written. Less arguments about what "CONTROL" means, and order of operations.

Things I love:

• NEW TECH TREE!!! •
I love how it is less linear, and the design of the ship tree makes it easy to remember what piece of tech you researched last turn.

• NEW PLASTIC!!! •
These new sculpts are familiar, but look soo much sexier than the previous version. The double stack War Suns are amazing.

• NEW TRADE!!!! •
This dynamic is far superior than the previous version, and encourages people to get out into the galaxy to trade with their neighbors instead of the big turtle move that was a popular tactic in TI:3.

Things I don't love:

• Artwork/design •

I am not a fan of the artwork as it compares to 3rd. Some of the races feel a bit too WIP. The hexes have planet types that are the same color as the technology specialties, which is wickedly confusing and would've been an easy fix by adding in other colors for the planet types. Racial specific cards and Plastic specific cards could've been more clearly colored for organization.

• Objectives •

I think this is an easy fix with an expansion, but the lack of objectives is a bummer. This is the core of the game. The more the objectives, the more the diversity in strategies, etc. I would like to see them release objective packs, but until then I will be pulling in objectives from 3rd.

• Combat •

It works, but it is identical to 3rd. With the exception of some tiny tweaks with techs, ships still suffer from the same problems in 3rd. Dreddies are far too expensive for what they do. A cruiser II hits on 6s vs a dreddies 5s and costs 1/2 as much. While moving 3 vs 2 with type IV. I miss the Mech Units, ground combat is much less interesting now.



Apart from some minor gripes, this game is an all-star. Nothing will ever satisfy like winning a 10 hr game of Twilight Imperium with a giant swing turn where you come from behind and score 4 points with the #8 strategy card. This game will always be the pinnacle of gaming for my group and I.


Preordered from FFG, not sure the hardcover rulebook was worth the extra $$ — They also included some prints of the artwork that look like they were done on the in-house inkjet printer the night before shipment.

An improvement over the superb third edition in nearly every way. Player interaction and unique faction abilities are pleasingly emphasized, and the entire game flows far more smoothly than third edition ever did while not sacrificing any of the strategic complexity and tactical nuance that the previous version did so well. Of particular note are the excellent rebalancing of the Strategy cards, the new formal rules for deals versus transactions, and the Agenda Phase occurring each round with two votes each time rather than only on the rare occasion that anyone bothers to waste time with the Politics action. All in all, this version took a great game and made it even better across the board, and I'd strongly recommend it to fans of past editions. It is, of course, still INCREDIBLY long and complicated, though, so that's definitely a point against it in terms of practicality.

Excluding the theme (personal taste) and dice rolling combat I think TI4 is very good indeed. The game has surprisingly intuitive rules once you overcome the initial learning curve but I don't think the fun to be had is quite enough to overcome the 5-6 hours of playtime and sheer amount of downtime. I can certainly understand the love TI4 receives because it does truly have an epic feel, but it's just not quite my cup of tea.

Absolutely the epic experience I expected it to be. Played 1 game with 4 people, took 6 hours with everyone new but one who had played TI3. I took an early lead and held Mecatol for 3 turns but was overcome on the last round. Politics mattered and was tense for us, and trade really bolstered one player's armies and allowed the building of multiple war suns. The superbowl of board games that I will look forward to playing 1-2 times a year.

A unique experience, very thematic, engaging and tense. You need to have one day for it, but you wont feel the hours passing. A huge pile of components + the deluxe rulebook and learn to play + 2 posters. After a first learning game which we didn t finish, I give it a solid 9 and expect the full game experience. Also, very well written rulebook and learn to play book; altough there are a lot of things to keep track of, the way those two are made helps a lot and clarifies every aspect of the game.

RATING: 6
Just another TI3 variant. Rated 6 if you own TI3, otherwise I give it an 8.

I have been playing TI right fro v1 in 1997, in 2005 TI3 was a major improvement acknowledging the innovative mechanisms of Euros style game. Today in 2017 TI4 just feel like another TI3 variant. There are changes but they are minor, some are good some are bad. At any rate waiting 12 years for this TI4 is disappointing , it won't get consensus for every fans of TI3, and various groups will move on and play there own variation. It still use the same kind of mechanisms than TI3, and don't take into account the evolution in boardgame design over 12 years.

- VP objectives are still selected randomly and revealed once per turn. Which I find terrible for such a long game.
- Strategy cards text are a bit fiddly.
- The trade goods agreements works differently, I'm not yet sure about the net gain.
- The political phase is moved to the end of the turn, and you now vote for 2 laws one after the other after refreshing your planets, which is not elegant from a design perspective
- No "Distant Suns" exploration, no Leaders.

So you end up with a chaotic 8h long game,  players favoring the RPG aspect of TI will regret the fiddly rules. Whereas fans of strategy games will regret the number of random factor for such a lengthy game.

Additionally the 150$, the cost of TI3 + 1 expansion is too high for the offer. So if you own TI3 no need to rush on this one. Otherwise if you like this kind of SF extravaganza and can afford it, go get it.

Epic on every scale, this game is a devourer of time and tables alike.  I am usually a fan of epic games (War of the Ring, Star Wars: Rebellion, etc), so I knew this would be right up my alley.  My question was whether I could find friends that would enjoy it as well.  I found 3 lucky friends to join in on a game, and they all really enjoyed it as well, and agreed that it wasn't overly complicated to play once the basic structure of the game is learned.  The technologies and agendas do add quite a bit of complexity, but other than that, the game itself is easier to learn than I thought.  Love this game, can't wait to play again!

RATING: 5
...meh. Not terrible, but definitely overrated.

The core idea is definitely solid, and you'll have an OK time playing it. You can occasionally make big plays or entertaining deals, and there's some cool moments and bits of fluff. It wasn't a bad game, or the worst thing ever -it was a 5, slightly below average.

But my goodness are there a lot of flaws. The coolness of the good bits is (to a certain degree) a product of how boring the rest of the game is. Sometimes you'll get a great deal going or a tense bit of space combat but most of the time you'll be pushing plastic around for hours on end. Psychologically I'm sure it makes people value and remember the highs more but really it speaks to the fundamental aimlessness of the system. I was guaranteed to win for the last two rounds (it would have been one round, but somebody played one of the 1-per-deck action cards that was the only thing that could stop me. I spent the last hour and a half of the game with no decisions at all. Not no interesting decisions, no decisions whatsoever. In fairness we got a rule wrong about objectives that would have sped it up a bit but wow, bad taste.) A fan of the game mentioned on the podcast that you can generally plan your game out for the next few rounds fairly easily -people complain about that in 30-minute Dominion, there's no excuse for a 7.5 hour game like this.

You have about 5 different core systems, most of which have some minor impact on each other but it's always sort of a tangential thing. The game feels more like an accretion of half-baked ideas duct-taped together than any sort of thing that a designer carefully put work into. Winning is achieved by fulfilling objectives that play into these subsystems, but different races get huge bonuses to them. I'm the tech-focused race, two objectives come up that require lots of tech, guess I'm winning this game!

The races are horribly unbalanced in lots of unfun ways, and unlike Cosmic Encounter you don't have a great way of dealing with it because interaction is so spatially limited and combat is so costly. Play a game of Cosmic Encounter, then play a game of Eclipse, and you'll have a better experience that takes less time.

And the Puerto Rico strategy card selection thing is basically the worst. Like I'm not even sure how it worked in '05 but in '17 you've got no excuse. There are more complaints but really, who has the energy.

I know the description doesn't sound like a 5 but the number of complaints is so large just because of how big of a game it is. I didn't hate it, it was a decent time with some cool people. I liked that bit. But man the design is a dumpster fire. :robot:

RATING: 6
I enjoyed the 4th edition much better than the third edition; many of the problems with technology and the political phase have been much stronger and streamlined. The new player aids and quick references sheet definitely make the game feel easier to move forward quicker. 

All of that said, this game takes a lot of time to setup, play, and this game can cause extreme AP for certain players. 

If you like TI3, you will love TI4, and in the end, play what you love.

Rating based on TI3.  If you don't own or haven't played TI3, this is a solid 8.

I won't say too much because in the end, this is very much still Twilight Imperium and my glowing remarks are made on 3rd edition.  So why the lower score?

Mostly because I find TI4 unnecessary.  It doesn't bring enough to the table to warrant dumping your TI3 collection if you have it.  Yes, some annoyances were removed and some things clarified, but others take their place.  It doesn't break the game in any way, but from the perspective of someone who might own TI3 and its expansions, just keep it.  Even in the future, FFG won't do too much to change it.

To me, TI4 is a content patch and little else.  Again, if you don't have it (or friends that have it), go get it.  Absolutely one of my favorite games ever.  Just don't feed the cash grab.

This game took too damn long. I would have been okay with the 10 hour time investment if the game felt solid, however, it felt way too random justify the long playtime. I kept getting impossible secret quests and terrible action cards so I just sat through half of the game watching my opponents compete for the victory. Also, it had elements of take that and kingmaking. Would consider playing again if it took 2-3 hours, but in reality, nooononono no nono. No.

[b]The theme:[/b] There isn't a more epic theme than the one in Twilight Imperium games. In it, you fight over the control of an imperial throne which has been recently (and voluntarily :devil: ) vacated by the former rulers. Nothing changed about the theme but they did add a whole "book" describing the background of the universe, which is filled with amazing artwork :)

[b]The components:[/b] Well, it is FFG, so of course, the cardstock and everything is great. But, moreover, the artwork and the miniatures are even better than in 3rd edition! 

[b]The fun:[/b] Oh, so much fun! You plot, you bribe, you fight, you manipulate and you (occasionally) lie. Is there something more fun? Nope!

[b]The gameplay:[/b] It is basically the same as in 3rd ed with minor changes (but they make the game better). The tech tree is gone and now you can personalize what you get much better. The politics also got a huge boost and it makes the game longer, yes, but also more involved.

I often find 4x games to be tiresome presenting players with far too many rules and options. I’m not a huge fan of minis in a game, give me some more cardboard. I did however really enjoy this game!

Having played third edition 10 years ago I might have been armed and ready to go, but after spending 30 minutes reading the learn to play, I was able to sit down and play this game relatively briskly with two experienced gamers. 

This was the aspect I most enjoyed, that this 6+ hour game took me effectively no effort to play and enjoy. On your turn, you basically have two options: do stuff on the board or play card. No separate actions for doing research, building units, moving, initiating combat, etc. You can do all of the above by choosing to do something on the board or playing a card. Easy as pie!

The deal making/bribing with commodities and trade goods is amazingly simple. The agenda phase was interesting in our game even with 3 players. 

My main criticism was that I thought the game was too long. I like long games but my first couple plays made it seem like this game was never ending. Turns out this had to do mostly with a rules mistake with the way victory points are awarded. I can't see this game ever taking more than 8 hours with reasonably competent players. That is unless you're playing to a higher victory count. 

Given the ease to learn and the excellent balance between player interaction vs interaction with the game system, I’ll likely try to get this to the table often. 

EDIT: Upped my rating to a 10 after playing with 6 players, all of which have played a learning game prior to the main event. Our game finished in under 8 hours with many rules look ups, various political argument, and a few breaks. Considering we were all new, this was great! Next time will be even shorter. Everyone had a blast, down time wasn't an issue, and the game play was just fun! This long game will get played often!!

RATING: 8
A very streamlined and sleek new version of an old favourite. It still feels like the game I know and love, but its different in some quite subtle ways.

I do like the new tech mechanics but I do kind of miss the tech tree. Now techs have colours and a requirement of certain colours already in place. This new mechanic is much better for inexperienced players verses the tech tree which could be fairly intimidating.

Not having a political phase AT ALL until somebody controls Mecatol Rex feels very strange and honestly we didn't see much politics that mattered in our little race to 10vps (short game).

I am not sure why they felt the need to make the war suns more 3D (i.e two piece models) and the flagships are quite similar in design to the dreadnoughts making them a little difficult to pick out on the board, but minis are good, although this still suffers from too many minis on the hexes making it very cluttered.

Very impressed with how they cut out a lot of the fat of the third edition and third edition expansions and streamlined this game into a much tighter design.  I would even describe the rule set as tight now.  Love how the politics mechanic is greatly improved.  Objectives give you many more option.  Technology research is greatly improved.  Each edition just keeps making the game better.

Edit:  after my first play, I have to say that the rule books need much more credit.  Compared to prior editions of TI, these rule books are amazing.  The reference rule books is clearly organized and worded; saves a ton of time as you pay the game, as rules questions can be quickly resolved.

Played it a dozen times. Own the 3rd edition with expansions, which is still one of my favorite 4x games to play. This game definitely doesn't live up to the hype. The new assembly phase and the slimmed down decks are an improvement for sure. However, beyond that the game just feels like a dumbed-down (or simplified in a bad way) version of 3rd edition, and the new tech system is actually very bad IMO. 

I have noticed that some reviewers have given higher ratings under the premise that an expansion with make the game better, but I base my rating on what I got for what I payed for. Therefore I summarily give this game a solid 4 stars, and recommend that you stick with TI3 (albeit with expansions).

RATING: 5
This is my second time playing TI. Don't think I will ever again. It feels very much like a MB wargame made in the 1980s or 1990s (sort of like A&A) and has a very boring dice-heavy battle system. Lots of building up of a fleet and then sending it out to have dice battles. Except it takes 6-8 hours. Way too much to keep track of in terms of constant ability and ship upgrades. The laws and some light diplomacy are the most interesting parts, but it's not enough to save this game. What makes the game so "tight" (and is also a big problem I have with it) is that as soon as one player makes a little headway they are immediately dealt with through attacks, card effects, bash-the-leader, etc. This creates an equilibrium that fakes tension by keeping everyone at around the same level (and if you somehow slip behind - you will never EVER catch up and you will have to spend 4-6 hours watching others doing better). Objectives can also be quite random and a few that come out are ones that one or two players are already close to achieving while the others aren't even close. The action cards have one too many "take that" effects for my liking. Don't get me wrong: I appreciate and accept and even can understand in a way why many people love this game. I think if you're sucked into the TI universe and play even twice a year, familiarity can help with the flow. But I'm just not one of those people who finds thrills in fairly luck-driven games that are over-loaded with card text upgrades and take an entire day to hash out. Most significantly, I think we've come a long way in board game design and that there are enough "Ameritrash" games and diplomacy games that can be played in shorter time, have more innovative mechanics, and don't rely so much on luck to drive combat, objectives, and tactics. I wish (WISH) this was a game I could love. But it's not even one I can like.

It's just waaaay too long. It's a game of negotiation, dice and random card draws (read ameritrash) with some great ideas, fun moments and hours upon hours of boredom. The game has so much going on and there are elements of euro strategy, but at the end of 10+ hours it's all decided by random chance. I feel like the game lacks soul and tries to spread itself too thin. It's trying to please everyone and obviously it's working for a lot of people, but not for me. I like the strategy actions (though leadership is OP) and their secondary follow actions, I like the command tokens and the puzzle of managing them well, but all the rest felt too random for me. I don't even think the dice were that much of a problem (though I think 10 sided dice are just fundamentally wrong), it's more about the objectives. It's fun to have such wildly different races, but it also means that by random chance someone can end up with secret objectives they complete on turn 1 and others with completely impossible ones, just by chance. This also means that the public objectives are much easier for some and beyond that, the objectives are so bland so that they could be somewhat possible for every race. This is the only thing the players are aiming for, pretty much the only way to get points, and they're boring and very unbalanced. The tier 2 cards are also just more expensive copies of the tier 1 cards, meaning that if someone has an advantage for one of them, they can easily get 2 more points in the later half of the game, leading to a massive 3 point swing. The diplomacy phase didn't really work for me either, most of the laws and directives are simpky not impactful enough and when they are, negotiation is a limited option since most people will have a strong opinion, so it's all about who has the most influence. That's also a very boring resource, in the first parts if the game it's only used for the effect of 1 strategy card and for the rest of the game it's only used on that and votes. Why even have it when there's nothing to do with it? The technologies are all good and well done, but they barely change between games and players, so everyone will end up with mostly the same stuff.

If you're going to have a game with a lot of randomness, why does it take so infinitely long to play? If you're going to have an epic game, why make it a race to points and why limit the amount of long term strategy to only technology and random, non-impactful laws? You can't even save up resources between rounds! So yeah, it's not for me, and compounded upon that it takes so long, so no I probably won't ever play again, hence the rating.

I mean, it's a marginal improvement over the disgrace that is TI:3, so I gave it a half a point bump--the tech tree is much more user-friendly. Other than that, my comment for TI:3 stands:
Setting aside the fact that it encourages turtling, setting aside the fact that the rules are a poorly-worded affront to usability, setting aside the grotesquely unbalanced everything (cards, chits, powers, etc. etc.) that have a huge effect on the game state, setting aside the fact that the victory conditions are at best stale and at worst utterly broken, setting aside the fact that the components themselves are some of the least user-friendly I've seen... Wait, what was I getting at?
Oh, yeah. Setting aside all that, there's precious little to actually do! You're always constrained by artificially-imposed bottlenecks or the simple fact that in this "epic" 8 hour monstrosity you basically just play weaksauce Puerto Rico in space and slowly move your lumbering fleets around.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: basicament és el mateix joc, han intentat accelerar el joc i reduir la seva durada, però les mecàniques bàsiques son les mateixes. Com a inconvenients principals, s'han carregat els Distant Suns (afegien atzar però aportaven l'exploració que falta) i s'ensenyen els objectius cada torn.

Segur que és millor que la versió anterior, però no modifica el suficient el joc com per eliminar tots els problemes que li veia. Algún dia el voldré jugar, però no el vull tindre a la ludoteca.

Takes far too long to be extremely highly rated, especially so if there's any new players. 6 player game took 9 hours and the players adjacent to the new player had huge advantages and ended up finishing 1st and 2nd. Likely worth an 8 if playing with only experienced players, a 5 if there's new players.

I have a great respect and appreciation for the game design in TI4.  I enjoyed playing it and seeing how it works.  My low rating is because the tremendous length of time TI4 takes to play and I am not a fan of games where you build military forces on a map and conquer opponents-- I would much rather play a shorter multiplayer points maximization puzzle (Euro game)  I would definitely play TI4 again in the right time and place, but I definitely don't need to own this epic, attractive dudes on a map project.  I enjoy the role selection mechanic and command token management.  I can't say enough about how impressed I was with how well designed TI4 is.  For what it sets out to do, it does marvelously well.  I prefer not to conquer other players' planets and destroy their fleets.

Wow. This game blew us away. We have only played a single 5-player game so far. There was enough fun, excitement, and value in that single play alone to justify the cost of the game. It is absolutely worth the steep up front learning curve and the long play times. Wife and I both give it a 10.

I see many people complaining about the combat (whether or not they have played the game). I'll say this: our gaming group has several Magic + Euro players that do not like dice and do not care for swingy randomness. They loved this game. The swingy nature of the dice combat somehow fits the theme perfectly.

A fantastic new edition that blends the best of 3e plus it’s expansions and brings enough newness to feel fresh. Plenty of room for expansion (distant suns, leaders, etc.) without feeling incomplete. The new strategy cards are the best yet, and the agenda phase makes politics really cool.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I actually do love the depth in the layers of the game strategy and how well it represents the intricacies of managing a space-capable faction. Very well made to make negotiation meaningful and the ever present tension is a win in this kind of game. The game just excels at mostly every mechanic.
That being said, I just cannot find it in me to want to play it again, seeing how dreadfully long it takes. What starts as an exciting and well balanced experience turns into a drag, and it just ends up taking too long for the value of the experience. You reach a point when you lack the focus to compute so many spaceships, the concentration to make sure you do not miss any detail (probably accidental cheating happens because people just can't track so many things), and the patience to keep talking to everyone.
Even though this was played by seasoned gamers with experience in long format games, by the end everyone was just making an effort, hoping it would end soon, stoichally trying to avoid kingmaking and playing their best. Still, when all players sigh at the end of the game, it's not a good sign...
This is one of those rare situations where I think this would have worked way better had it been implemented as is, as a videogame.

I don't get it. It feels like a strategic game but then you get hit by random cards that are objectively better.  I'm fine with a bit of randomness but not this much in an 8 hour game. No thanks. Really wanted to like it but when one person can't accomplish all their secret goals because they are all handed out randomly and that's just the way to win. I'd rather just roll dice to see who wins.

A great new edition of the best epic tabletop game of all time.  Streamlines some aspects that help somewhat to mitigate long playtimes and rules overwhelm when teaching new players.  Strengthens the king-of-the-hill aspect of Mecatol Rex, which is welcome.  Otherwise still brings all of the epic awesomeness from 3rd edition.  As long as you have a group that is up for complex games that take 60-90 minutes per player to play, you are in for a real real treat playing this game.  It rocks.

It makes me sad to rate this so low because TI3 was (and still is) one of my all time favorites. TI4 just has so little conflict compared to TI3. Almost everything else is an improvement (more balanced and diverse races, better technology mechanic, and better agenda/politics mechanic). 

However, ultimately, the objectives are all way too easy. They are all much easier than TI3 and very rarely require any conflict. This makes it more difficult for a player to stop others since players don't need to interact with others to gain VP and because taking another players home system (to stop them) takes resources/actions but doesn't provide VPs. Turtling is now more dominant and involves jumping out of your systems once, maybe twice, to complete the very few combat objectives that show (if they show). Games tend to end far sooner because of this (we've finished a 10 point game in 3 hours and 14 point in 5 hours) and the game is much less epic feeling and less satisfying for all players.

After 4 plays, we're back to TI3 until FFG releases an expansion. Hopefully the expansion has a new set of objectives. If not, we'll stick with TI3.

I can't describe how happy I am I bought this game, everything I heard about this game was exactly as exciting as imagined it would be, the review made by "shut up and sit down" couldn't describe this game better.

Let me tell you what is so amazing about this game:
I played two full games, in both of those games I got to understand what other reviewers said, you want to win? you better work your political skills, because war is consuming, which is very realistic and balanced, you want to gain control of planet? offer things and make deals. However, at some point someone will take the lead in terms of points or influence, someone will take control of the big planet Rex, this is when you will be forced to fight, but you are not doing it because the game is about fighting, it is because every one is only doing what serves them best, just like any country would act today, at points like these people will prbbly begin to build alliances and shake hands to keep their neighboring planets safe while they take down that common enemy who is spreading like cancer.
Ground combat is fantastic aspect of TI, because real battles are won on ground, no matter how strong you are in space if you can't win the fight on land you wont get any planets, some races like the humans have bad space fighting potential but they are really hard to kill one land, and eventually you would get to siege their space docs and planted for many turns without taking control of their planets, I just can't describe how realistic and balanced this is.
Once Mecatol Rex is taken galactic laws are introduced, where players should use their planets' influence to vote on them, and this phase is just as exciting as it looks, "fleet regulation" law for example limits the number of ships per system, we had that law in our game and I managed to win the vote resulting in destroying half the fleets of every player on the table, 

Bottom line if you are willing to play for ~6 hours and you enjoy the depth, this is the ultimate game, my all time favorite and one buy that I will never regret.

RATING: 5
Knowing that it was a long game I knew it would be difficult getting it on the table so I didn't want to buy it myself to collect dust on a shelf, but I have a friend who got it so I got a chance to play it. I have not played the previous versions, but I was expecting this to be at least somewhat an enjoyable experience. I don't think I will want to play this game again.

- The game is long which normally doesn't bother me, but in this game there will be a lot of down time when other players are thinkin/making their turn. The game can't really be sped up by people making their turns simultaniously.
- Winning the game is by points. The objectives will be random, the hidden objectives will be random. Consider yourself lucky if you can actually complete them. Thematically some objectives make no sense, why do you get victory points by having spaceships next to a meteor storm?
-The game should be balanced with conflict, players ganging up on a player if that player is 'winning'. If you can't attack/affect that player and others won't, there's not much to do. 
- I saw players spending a lot of time building huge armies and building tech without actually attacking each other for 8 hours. Lots of strategy cards affect combat, which is a waste if you don't actually do combat.
- Randomized planets near your homesystem might screw you over if you get garbage planets. 
- Some cards in the game should be explained more clearly. If the proof-reader doesn't actually know how to play the game, that person does not know how to fix a card which is written poorly. Apparently some cards have errors from previous versions of the game, as if the texts very just copied with the errors. It hope that isn't true.

An improvement over TI3, but still has some wonky scoring and players can be essentially eliminated hours before the game ends.  

Combat and teching up are the most fun parts but they aren't rewarded very much, so I'm left wondering why 90% of the game's rules are focused on them.  

The victory point objectives, both public and private, needed more development -- they're either boring or thematically nonsensical half the time.  With all the fun and interesting things this game offers, why have objectives that force players to do boring things instead?

The action cards add a significant layer of chaos and unpredictability (especially for new players) that I don't think is needed.

Fun, space epic game with a lot of moving parts that interact in interesting ways.  You need to keep the pace of play up because it can drag with AP prone players.  I enjoyed this more than the 3rd edition because I had only played that edition without expansions and it felt a little clunky with some of the interactions between cards (and I didn't love the imperial card in that version).  This version plays well and remains fun.

Reasons to not play Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition:
-It will eat 12 hours of your day.
-Learning and/or teaching the game is demanding.
-You will screw up rules at some point and it will be frustrating.
-There is some randomness involved which will also be frustrating.
-Finding players for this game is a challenge.
-Your table isn't big enough.
-It's 150 dollars.

Reasons why Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition is a 10/10:
-12 hours flew by so quickly because it's so damned fun.
-It is as epic, if not more than the box art implies.
-The rules are more coherent than they have any right to be.
-The game has rules for space combat, space trade, space science, space politics, space everything, and it's all excellent.
-It out-components everything else.
-You can win with all of the ways.
-You can have a game that's all-out violence 100% of the time and it will be fun.
-You can have a game where no one fires a shot until 8 hours in and will also be fun.

Play it, just find a way to play it.

Very much enjoyed a 5 player game. The game is very long and took 9 hours to complete but we all had a blast. 

Not a huge brain burner with strategy as one would think as the rules are pretty straight forward, but there is alot to remember and watch from the other players with limited amount of space. Combat is inevitable as the space systems start to be claimed. 

If you have much time and 4 to 5 players then this game is a much try.

This is the first and only edition of TI I have played and honestly it was a bit disappointing to me. I knew it would be long and was expecting something truly epic, but in the end I didn't feel the massive length of the game was met with equal amounts of fun. 
It felt mostly ok, with a combat system that I personally hated. I'm hoping that with a few more plays I get to appreciate why this game is so loved, but I don't think I'll want to play it again at least for a couple of months.

All this new chrome makes it look pretty. Inside you find a clumsy and slow game. It might be epic but the time consuming trading system drags the game. The continual arguments and bickering of every card played, makes me annoyed. Chop off the trade and the special cards, give me 3 secret objectives, reveal all public goals. Then I would have liked this game much more. Yes, I like Eclipse better.

FUN: this has replaced the 3rd edition for me as almost everything runs a little smoother. I also love that it comes with 17 races out of the box.

UNIQUE: although it’s not unique after 3rd edition, this defenitely the ultimate epic SciFi boardgame.

NEGATIVES: it’s still extremely long and the luck factor is still quite high for such a game. Although it is still not easy to teach, it has improved remarkedly when compared to the 3rd edition. The misprint on Hypermetabolism is a little annoying.

Play time was 7Hrs and 30Min total of 3 players. Would definitely play again if able. Requires long time to play, players need to know how to play ahead of time, and large amount of table space. Don't recommend for new table top players. Twilight Imperium is like hockey. You have to be offensive, defensive, flexible, and you might have to pick a fight. Even though fighting isn't good for either side.

After one full 4p game, this game feels good. It definitely moved fast with the Phase II Objectives and I was able to score the last 5 points I needed for the victory very fast (which made the game feel a little anticlimatic). Overall, I feel like most races will end up playing the same but have occasional perks. 
Update: after 3 months and ~10 plays, I really like this game. Unfortunately, my group hates how long it is so we will likely not play it as often as we have been. Even if we finish a 5-player game in 4 hours, it's still too long for them.

-Long play time combined with not caring what others are doing most of the time

First, a disclaimer: if you're playing with less than 6 players, I absolutely recommend setting up the game according to the [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/151808/ti4-balanced-setup-guide]TI4 Balanced Setup Guide[/url]. Otherwise, you will have way too many planets per player, which causes less player interaction and way too many planets to deal with. This will lead to the first hour or 2 of the game to be just invading planets, and players taking all their time just to think which ones they would prefer to conquer first. I don't know who designed the 'official' set-up, but he definitely didn't put much thought in it. Anyway, on to my review!

Okay, so this game is literally everything I wanted in a board game in the days I adored Catan but didn't know about many other board games. Now that I've played this, I now know better than ever what I want in board games, and it's not this.

Yes, this is absolutely amazing to simulate a Civilization-like game, but with actual people you can negotiate with. Border sharing is just as amazing (don't you dare come closer!) and I just love the promissory notes. Negotiating is bit hard and infrequent in the first game, but once you have an idea about the worth of everything, it gets better. I love bribing people who are about to attack me to change your mind, and it's very easy to amp up what you're offering ("I'll give you a Ceasefire if you don't; I give you a Ceasefire and all my Trade Good if you don't...)

Despite this fun border negotiation, the Agenda phase was my biggest disappointment with the game. Agenda cards are weird, with complete different "for" and "against" effects and sometimes I've to wonder how they make any sense thematically. I like the agendas where you have to elect someone/something though so it's not all bad. What I like the least about it is that you have so many influence points that the points lose their value. It's almost never the case of "if only I had 1 more planer with influence". It might have been better if everyone just got one vote and maybe the speaker and/or owner of Mecatol Rex 2. Negotiating is also pretty uninteresting when no one cares about the agenda, which happens quite frequently actually.

The action cards can get a bit much, especially if you have the technology that lets you draw 2 each turn, and I'd rather have they weren't included in the game at all (or like max 7 different types, preferably less). This in addition to all the technologies and ship types, and I find there's a bit too much going on in the game. They all have the same problem of having too much variation, and I'd rather have like 3 or 4 very distinct ships, technologies and action cards.

Love the strategy cards, but I wished the secondary effects were more consistent and in line with the primary effect (at least for like Warfare and Diplomacy) to make it straightforward (do you want to join in the effect by paying a strategy token or not). This gets better of course once you know them, but it's still a minor gripe I have with them. I think the strategy cards would be even better in the 5+ game, when you to choose only one (but who can find that many people willing to play, m i rite?)

TLDR; just a bit too much going on. Would rather have it more streamlined. Eclipse seems like it would be better, can't wait to try it with the upcoming second edition!

If you are new to TI4, STOP RIGHT HERE! This  attempted if you only have been on a treadmill once upon a time. 

It is possible to play a full game within 240-480 min, if you do it well. 

To really see what the majority is talking about, I recommend you do the following: 

- Try your first couple of games with the minimum amount of players: 3. No more. 
- Have the host of the game set up the game ahead of time using a preset map in the Learn to Play manual so when the guests arrive, precious time is not wasted. 
- Read all the public and secret objective cards in advance (to avoid being taken by surprise). HINT: Controlling a lot of planets, and Mecatol Rex, helps a lot.
- DO NOT spend too much time thinking about each move. Use a timer or an hour-glass if you have over-thinkers in the group. Each player plays multiple turns per round - it adds up.  
- There are a lot of wonderful tools in this website. Don't be afraid to use some of them. I hear that the TI4 SuperCheatBooklet is very useful. :)
- Once you get quite familiar with the game, include a 4th player. Once that player is comfortable, include a 5th, etc.

The definitive edition of one of the best epic strategy games of all time!

A nearly perfect marriage of theme and mechanics, with just enough luck to make the combat tense while still rewarding skill and strategy over random chance.

The only downsides are the extremely long playtime (4-8 hours, depending on player count and experience) and the necessary complexity for a game this vast. If those aren't negative points for you, then this may prove to be your favorite game!

RATING: 8.3
Initial rating based on single, starting game. I think it will go up as I play another couple games... I really wanted to like it more than I did, but I blame it on everyone (incl. me) being new to the series and 2 of us creating a Cold War situation... and also the pretty anti-climactic ending. It was a good exploration of the game, however, and I have a much better idea about how I'd want to play my next game!

Update: Game 2, 6 players
Oh man. Space opera is correct... 4 new players 2 who played in my first game. The rules explanation started at 1/1:30pm and the game "ended" at 1:30am (break for dinner). This time we had a *much* better experience overall, with plenty of negotiations and battles. The promissory notes really add value to diplomacy (we opted out of these the first game). The game was *way* slower with 6 people instead of 4 though, with many more negotiations and planning. I think we would play faster next time, but with everyone learning to play we should've known.

My gripes with this game are that there are times when people are unsure what they should even be doing... sure, the objectives are always there, but sometimes (especially the first few rounds) there may not be enough to strive for. Additionally, once the 2 point objectives come out, it seems like the game snowballs. That said, it still lasts forever, but it just doesn't seem like as much happens.

In total, I really like it. 3rd game will be happening in a couple weeks... I'm going to have the newbies read the rules beforehand as if there was an exam taking place!

Was really excited to see this announcement but for me personally the interest has waned.  I've already got TI3 with both expansions and this doesn't seem to offer much different from that.  If they'd upped the graphic design in a big way I'd probably still be on-board but as it is I think this is going to be a pass for me.  Great jumping on point for new players though.

This game is just amazing. For a new gamer like me, this was just amazing. You just need a day off and you're all set for this beast in a box. Though it was a bit tough for my first game which made it a bit questionable, though when you get a hold of the rules the real fun begins. This game is perhaps as Quinns(from SuSd) says in his review of this game. Almost, everything boardgames can be. A massive time consuming and epic game. Awesome!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Twilight Imperium is a grand game that requires an excessive amount of study to master its sometimes unclear rules. The only explanation for rule oversights and missing clarifications is a lack of play testing with people who have never played the game before. With that being said this is a game that you want to invest the time to learn how to play. I can easily see how lacking someone to teach them the game or the persistence to overcome any rule issues could turn some people away. However, once learned this is sure to become a semi-yearly event you look forward to.

The components are top notch and what you would expect from Fantasy Flight but be prepared to have a large table to play this on. The creation of the game board is one of the best aspects of the game and should not be overlooked by using the toned down learn to play rules. Why something that takes about ten minutes to learn is an "advanced setup" I have no idea. I am sure there are tactical advantages to placing the location of certain board tiles but let people discover these through play.

Is it worth the money? That depends ...did you like Star Wars Rebellion or other epic sci-fi games? Then yes but be prepared to learn the rules and invest 6-8 hours of game time.

What I don't understand is the different ratings by people who own TI3, either the game is worthy of one rating or the other independent of owning the older edition - please make up your minds.

The biggest disappointment is finding problems with the rules:

[b]Transactions:[/b] The rules do not make it clear that transactions can be done in addition to a regular action during your turn. They are not mentioned on the Quick Reference Guide at all.

[b]Quick Reference Guide:[/b] Somehow FFG went from a streamlined quick reference guide for Star Wars Rebellion to a poorly organized one. Each part of a round should be nested in the guide sequentially. While the "Frequently Overlooked Rules" should have been on a separate page and a summary of the Agenda phase include in the quick reference guide.

Solid improvements all around. After rules review, the game took about 1 hour per player which is nice. The changes to the tech tree are very welcome. The way objectives are handled is much more smooth and enjoyable. The components are much nicer. I very much liked the new role cards and their effects. The whole experience seemed much smoother, although I did raise my eyebrows at a few things. The first thing that seemed odd to us was that the game has action cards which are played during the laws phase. The action card essentially says 'accurately predict the way the vote will go and get X'. Then the laws tend to have an effect for those who voted yes and an effect for those who voted no. The rules of the game allow players to abstain. If everyone abstains, then the player with the speaker token chooses a resolution for the law, but since they didn't vote, then they can let the effect succeed or fail without getting/suffering the reward/penalty, and negating the action card's effect. Perhaps we played this wrong, but it felt odd. Another issue is that the action card that cancels someone's action card is still in. I don't know who still thinks counterspells are fun, but I guess those people still work at FFG. Component wise I also feel it's odd to still have custom tokens for all umpteen factions when the triangles and vp markers could just be in the six player colors, and save us all a lot of bits and boxspace.

Again though. Overall good. I am impressed and happy with it. I'm just finding little flaws in it's armor is all. I will play it again, and it will stay on my shelf.

RATING: 6.5
Ended up buying it for a reasonable price (100 bucks or so - I think the MSRP of $150  is a bit of a rip off) during the CSI Christima's sale.

Sure, the game is somewhat streamlined and the new art is really good, but, in the end, the game itself is not that much different from TI3 - you still need a great amount of time and dedication to play it, which usually is not a problem but in this case you have to play with the right group and everyone must be willing to cooperate and be patient - and then some. 

Exploring is basically absent in this new vanilla set, so I guess I'll end up buying the unavoidable expansion that will reintroduce it to the game.

If you own TI3 plus that expansion that adds exploring, well, for now you have a superior game to this one.

To sum it up: Is it overpriced at the MSRP? Probably yes. Is it the best 4x out there? No, it's not even a full 4x (more like a 3.5X). Best political game out there? Definitely not. Best game set in space? No. Best miniatures of 2017? Not even close. Is it a game that is more than the sum of its parts? Yes it is! Best game of all time though? No, it is surely not!

Highly enjoyed playing this. It has a high learning curve but after 2-3 rounds you get the hang of things. Learn to play and rules reference are also very good so there wasn't too much confusion. It does take a long time compared to other games to finish but i found victory points started flowing in faster after the first 4-5 rounds.
Highly recommend playing a 4 player game as a learning game, take your time with it and google if confused. It makes playing the 2nd game even more interesting when everyone has had a learning game under their belt.

RATING: 6
Yesterday I had my worst gaming experience ever playing this. It was literally constant, loud and sometimes offensive bickering for nine hours. I hated it.

Most of the players really loved it. But I thought its mechanisms brought-out the worst in their personalities.

There are some very clever rules in this game (the movement rules, the distribution of command tokens etc). This core gameplay (before all the clutter) is intelligent and streamlined.

But it also has high randomness, an excess of little rules on dozens of cards, crazy game length, and a potential to dramatically over-excite (in a bad way) players who get a nefarious thrill out of "gotcha-ing" other players. Then, near the end, there is kingmaking.

If you lose the game, it's probably because of something chaotic. Your opponents will have a lot of little cards in front of them and one of those is bound to catch you unaware. It's usually something obscure, such as one of them suddenly being allowed to teleport to your vital starbase. 

Trying to keep track of those cards is like herding cats but it's the heart of the gameplay. It's a dark heart.

To its credit, it does keep 'first come, first serve' mechanisms to a minimum (apart from Strategy Cards), which is a relief because they would push it totally over the edge.

Personally I'd rather play Imperial 2030 for a much leaner alternative that still does armada-building, battling and negotiation.

Basically, I just like a game where I can keep track of things without getting a huge headache and constantly having to ask people what's on their cards. And Twilight Imperium 4 isn't it.

Having said that, I even find games like the popular Dead Of Winter a fiddly mess, so I'm in the minority. I will play Merchants & Marauders, even though that's a hugely fiddly mess, because it has a brilliant theme and makes it easier to track your opponents' abilities than Twilight Imperium 4 does.

Oh man, this is really fun, but *incredibly* complex (no news there, right?). I had a blast and would definitely play again -- maybe quarterly is the right frequency for me -- but I see this being a pretty exclusionary game, meaning you have to play it with people who really want to play a serious game. It also kinda has to be the core activity of the day because of the length and focus it requires. That said, would definitely play again! The complexity and replayability is pleasing to me as a big old nerd.

Tweaks and improves on its predecessor in every way. It's now a really slick game -  as slick as a an epic 8 hour civ and conquest game can be. TI3 didn't make it to the table as often as I hoped, but with TI4 I'm going to make sure it does. 

While TI4 doesn't have all the add-ons and options that TI3 + expansions offered, you'll have to be a dedicated hardcore to exhaust the gameplay out of the box. And no doubt FFG will be offering expansions in short order.

Really solves some of the problems of balance and slowdown of the original. It is still a very slow game- but we got to 7 points in 8 hrs instead of 2 points in twice that time with 3rd ed.
The organizer in the box is better than none; easier points; racial differences are spread across a couple more things than before. Mecatol Rex is more important and central and forces conflict over it. 
Politics is better and more mandatory. Trade goods are mega-important and developing strategic alliances is required to really thrive.

This is NOT a pure tactics game; it is a tactics AND negotiation game. You need both to win reliably- this helps balance the factions a little. 
The races still fall into more or less easy to win with- but I can say with confidence you can win with any race if you understand their particular strengths and bargaining power.

Great game to waste an entire weekend on- Kudos to Fantasy Flight for really improving on an already rewarding experience.

This is a game I'll shell out 200 euro for a flight ticket back to Sweden for a weekend, just to spend a Saturday engaged in a galactic space opera. The fourth edition manages to improve the best board game ever made.

RATING: 4
A neat and immersive game.  With 3 players, it is a bit too fiddley and too longer for what it is, but I can see how 5-6 players would make it shine.  Things like voting coalitions for political votes and preventing static board locks would likely all improve with more players.

...But there really isn't enough going on to justify the playtime.

note:  I better understand the bizarre level of love this game gets when I realized that it is not a strategy game.  This is a 4-8 hour series of anecdotal surprises.  Each is thematically cute and dramatic and random.  They are exciting individually, and collectively completely random, slow moving, and simultaneously devoid of meaningful strategy and meaningful politics.  But as a series of sci-fi experiences, it's far more fun than it has any right to be.  The length makes you feel invested and the completely ridiculous randomness makes you feel upset, so things happen.  I guess that's something some players like, but as a game (and certainly as a strategy game) it's barely even an entry.

In the end, I'd rather play almost any other 4x game, but if I find myself in a group who want to play TI4, I'd play it purely thematically and forget about the pretense of being a game.  And I'd probably have some fun.

randomly drawn "take-that" cards are a huge turn off and trade is weak. might be interesting to get more into agendas, laws, and trying more factions. i don't feel like the time investment to get anything good out of this game is worth it compared to getting the good out of Race For The Galaxy, Sidereal Confluence, etc. skip this and instead play those two with a few rounds of Cosmic Encounter. same thing, but with bathroom breaks.

Tried TI4 for the first time today. I'm a huge fan of TI3 so had great hopes for TI4. I'm afraid this did not live up to the hype. Don't get me wrong, it is a good game but TI3 is just a better game as it is now.

The good:
- Player aids are must better and give nice overview
- Political Phase is bettter
- The strategy cards are better (except for 1 thing, see below)
- The Racial abilities are better

The bad:
- No Distant sun counters. This is by far the most poor thing about TI4. There is no excitement in the exploration part (to the point I would call this a 3X game and not a 4X game anymore :-( ... )
- While tech tree in TI3 was a bit too complex perhaps the new system is too simple
- No leaders (gave good dynamic)
- The iconography of the planet tiles are terrible compared to TI3
- While the trade agreement system in TI3, the new commodities system in TI4 is even worse and confusing to new players.
- Only having exactly enough tiles
- Less ways to get command counters via strategy cards (good but too much focus of influence)

The predecessor, TI 3rd Edition, is the game with which I got introduced to modern board games. Yes, that's right: I got flung from "I know nothing beyond Risk and Monopoly" into TI3. Well ... the game was good enough to turn me into a board game geek. ;) It would still be my favorite game if it weren't for one fact:

- TI4 got released and improves on everything.

Also: A session of TI still takes a bit of time to complete. It's worth every single minute though!

As a consequence of that TI4 gets my highest rating so far. It might only be a 9.7 right now, but expansions could push that. ;)

1 play (first of any TI), was able to keep interested the whole game.  6p, I was only rookie.  Really really enjoy the whole Strategy selection system along with managing your tokens.  Makes for some great choices on how/when to do the things you need while trying to take advantage of secondary actions.  Started thinking about the game a ton after the game/next day which is always a good sign.  Giving an 8 for now, I hope to be able to carve time out to play it some more.  For sure a unique and epic experience.  Could see picking this up even if just to play once or twice a year.  Not sure how it will rank with repeated plays, but I'm hopeful at this point didn't seem to be too long (maybe TI3 would have felt that way) and I'm not opposed to a long game if it keeps my interest.

Shared ownership with Derek and Dan.  2nd game I got a lot more out of it and almost pulled off a win.  I rate this game higher than an 8 but I think it would only be an 8 if you didn't get the right players together.  This game can have a lot of alpha players and be won by someone that is not talking at all which makes it a 10 in my book.  So many secrets, so many alliances made and so many broken.  If you have an entire day and a group of 3 or 6 it is a blast.  I didn't like it as much with 5.  I like it with 3 if you don't form alliances, and 6 if you do form alliances.  5 is lopsided with one person getting picked on by 2 other alliances.  I didn't play it with 4 but I can imagine that would be fun too.  6 is definitely the best way and if you have the time this is fantastic!

I only played the 3rd edition once, and more than half of a game of the new 4th. 

I like the changes I noticed. The technology cards are SO much better. The ship upgrades go straight on your player boards so you don’t forget to use them, and the progression of upgrades is much more clear. This alone makes the game much more playable while remaining interesting. Such a shame that there is a terrible misprint on one of the cards. I hope/assume they will be corrected in a future expansion.
I look forward to more plays.

50% do not recommend with 3 players but the variants and expansions seem to help.

Yet: "6, or 8 players is best for Twilight Imperium but 3 or 4 is perfectly fine (5 or 7 has some problems). 4-5 hours is pretty unlikely, especially if it's anyone's first time; 7-10 is more likely (though a 3 player game might be on the shorter side)."

Yet:Four players is actually my favorite number to play with, albeit with a slight caveat: it only really works well if you play with the shattered empires expansion strategy cards, red tape bureaucracy and both warfare 1 and 2.
 Red tape bureaucracy is a fairly common house rule variant where all public objective cards are laid face up so everyone can view them, but each has a "red tape" token on it. The bureaucracy strat card lets you remove a red tape token instead of drawing and looking at objective cards. Objectives with redtape tokens on them can't be scored.
 Playing with both warfare strats ensures someone isn't stuck with diplomacy every turn. So strat cards should be leadership, diplomacy 2, assembly, production, trade 2, warfare 1, warfare 2, tech 2, and red tape bureaucracy.
 In case you're unaware, the shattered empires expansion balances out the game so much it is almost mandatory. Plus it adds enough awesome stuff to 100% justify its price.
 The game sadly doesn't work very well with three in my experience (which is ample aha. Probably my favorite game). Just not quite enough for real alliances/strategy.
 Four player is awesome though, very tense and very very personal.

Yet:I actually found that 5 players is hands down the worst player count for me. Less roles are picked than any other count and the map set up is very awkward.

I've found the game plays best in even numbers and 4 for us is excellent. I still prefer 6, but I'll gladly play with 4 or 6+.

RATING: 9
Great game, very slick and fast - our very first run through with 5 players was only 6 hours. The game is somewhat of a sandbox which is why some say it's not an aggressive game - sure you can sit in the corner if you want, and you'll almost certainly lose. The objectives I find to be plenty aggressive as they encourage targeted attacks.
All in all, my best buy this year  - the only sad thing about it is whether Eclipse will ever make it to the table again..

RATING: 9
Improves on TI3 in every way, still has the feel of an epic space opera but removes a lot of the "clunkiness" from the previous version, would like an expansion to add some more planet tiles and 7-8 players, even if it just adds to decks and gives more color choices. Would also like the MU back.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Why it is an 8:

Variable Races: I love games that differentiate players based off of arbitrary restraints from the components/mechanics.  Asymmetry usually gives an interesting decision space, and TI4 has asymmetry in spades.

Role Selection: The strategy cards are a great aspect of the game.  Every player gets an amazing ability, but only by forsaking other abilities.  This opportunity cost can be painful, especially late in the round when you realize you could have won had you taken another.  Additionally, withholding your special ability until others cannot benefit from it as much is a fun micro competition.

Scale: Space opera.  Large, romantic, dramatic stories that span solar systems and centuries. 

Player Interaction: 4th edition greatly expanded the player interaction.  Now, politics isn't just a strategy card; they can be a way of life.  A player could amass promissory notes during the early game, threatening military retribution, giving commodities, or attacking enemies to acquire them.  Interactions can organically evolve from player's priorities and alliances can be forged and broken in moments.

Why it is not a 9:
Could be stuck not having fun: I am not sure if this is as much of a problem as it was in TI3.  The lack of distant suns, more achievable public objectives, and rebalanced races help keep the game from entering that "no hope of winning through no fault of my own" state.  Furthermore, the ability of players who are doing well to trade promissory notes and commodities to a player who is behind for small gains, gives those behind players some bargaining power to better their position. 

Why it is not a 10:
Play group dependent: This is kind of a problem for every game: if you add someone to the game who doesn't like it, the game can be a drag for everyone.  This is more of a problem for Twilight Imperium because there are few people who are up for a long, difficult game that they likely won't win, sometimes through no fault of their own.  People in TI4 have a much greater capacity to lose the game on purpose to force someone else to win out of spite.  This is a game that rewards a solid play group, but can be punishing if anyone is a poor sport, has low endurance, gets impatient, prefers a lot of action, hates conflict, has trouble focusing, an any of a host of other player quirks.

RATING: 2
Seems very dumbed down and simplified.  If you want a simplified game then epic long games are not for you.  Being an old time Avalon Hill player I have no problem with lots of rules and intricacies in play.  Simplifying Twilight Imperium makes it more of an overlong bloated Euro which it is not supposed to be.  I prefer the harder tech tree with more prerequisites as it makes more since rather then just having the right colors to get more.  
It seems like every aspect that some love with this new version is the very same aspects that make me never want to put it on my table or own it.

RATING: 8
SUPER epic...very dramatic.  A space game that actually gives you plenty of time to breathe, develop a strategy, see it through to the end.  Combat seemed a touch involved for what it is, or rather I had a hard time gauging how to successfully campaign and take over someone else's planet.  Maybe it's supposed to be costly and take multiple turns, I dunno.

Long term TI3 fan, an read all the rules and cards.
Very nice polish. Will make extensive review after my pre order arrives, rating 9 for now based on previews.

Edit : My pre order arrived and we just played our first game. Component quality is excellent and all the changes that were made to TI3 seemed for the better. Upgrading my score to a perfect 10. Twilight Imperium remains my favorite board game franchise. 

I don't think the game takes too long to play, I just wish I had the time to play more games!

A streamlined version of TI3. Manages to do everything just a little better. Looks better. Better miniatures. Better cards. Better everything. Turns a game that I already rated a 10 (with expansions) into something even better. 

Where TI3 started to show its age, TI4 does a great job at neatening things up into one definitive package.

RATING: 9.4
Looks better and resolves a number of the issues with TI3, such as encouraging more dealing and skirmishes and fewer giant cold war fleets.  Whole group liked this edition more and we play enough that this was worth buying the new version.  That said, I'm feeling like the faction balance could have been better when there was so much development time and it removes a couple features I liked, which I assume I will now have to rebuy in future expansions.

Best game ever made. No other game comes close. It has everything a gamer needs. resource management, negotiation, great tactical and strategic decisions, combat, asymmetrical powers, multiple paths to victory, drives player interaction, immersive theme, and detailed backstory, great art and components. And this version is the culmination of honing it to a razor sharp point of awesome over decades. Yea, it's that  good.

So much has been said abut this epic space opera, that I doubt I could add anything truly substantial to its praises. Its minor flaws don't make me love it any less (although I really hope they issue the correctly spelled Hypermetabolism card with the inevitable expansion).

RATING: 6
1st impressions: A hard game to give a numerical rating to as it is so niche. As a 4x game that demands a 12 hour commitment it certainly does the job and could well deserve the 9 average rating it has achieved at the time of writing. However, I'm unlikely to be able to find another 12 hour block to devote to a second playing of this any time soon, and even when I eventually do have the opportunity, I'm pretty sure I'd prefer to play 4 or more excellent games instead of one game of TI4.

I could picture my 20-year old self getting enthusiastic about this game (if it had existed back then) and playing the hell out of it. I might have memorised all the unique racial traits, learnt all the objective cards and action cards and utilised all this information to  devise grand strategies to unleash upon my circle of fellow TI4 geeks... but this is no longer me.

There are many nice design touches in this game that I appreciate. I like the command token system that allows you to effectively and dynamically determine how many action points you get each round. I like how elegant the activation system is - the way those command tokens give a simple and effective visual reminder of which units have acted in the turn and which have not is brilliant.

These days I like my games to be under 3 hours. These days I like victories to come from celebrating clever plays rather than from punishing mistakes or - worse - from exploiting gaps in my opponents knowledge of the game (aka the Games Workshop problem). I like complexity to come from the way game mechanics interact with each other rather than an overload of options, asymmetries and game-changing card draws (aka the Arkham Horror problem). I like rules to be clear and unambiguous.

It is for these four reasons that my rating is 'only' a 6. Admittedly half of these reasons would disappear if I played the game several more times with the same group - but realistically that is not going to happen. Even if it did miraculously happen, I'd still be stuck with the first two issues. I fully understand that these aren't issues for some, so I can understand how this game gets high ratings and a cult following, but this is not the cult for me.

Update to Twilight Imperium 3rd edition: major updates to make politics and trade more meaningful, technology tree is simpler to manage, slightly tweaked public and secret objectives, race boards and technology upgrades easier to track. Includes all races from previous expansions, race-specific flagships.

Just played 6 person in two nights(lost).  I like what they did with the tech(streamline) and the races seemed more balanced.  The new commodity/contract system adds for a lot of table  trash talk(loving it) but does slow game down a tad.  Miniatures/artwork/lore is all awesome.  Still one of my top 10 and cant wait to get my revenge.

A "ten" off of a single play is a touch generous, especially for a game that will, realistically, get played maybe once or twice a year... but that single play was brilliant.  Though I did poorly, the game generated a wonderful narrative and a complexity of negotiation and diplomacy that I haven't seen in many other games; made better by the fact it was supported by the game's mechanics.

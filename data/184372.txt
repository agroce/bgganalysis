Is it objective to vote a game you worked on for so long? Anyway I am really happy with the result and enjoy the outcome a lot. Hopefully at Essen 2015 the first copies will see public light...

I have Batman and Superman and the teamplay is very interessting. Also both work surprisingly well in single play.

I am very much looking forward to the next hero sets: Flash and Green Lantern.

Solo - Superman can get swamped if Villains both have 'No Heat Ray'.

Multi-Play - expect replay factor to increase with more heroes.

A good game that gets 8 points from me, but as a DC fan I have to ADD 1 extrapoint.
I bought it in Essen and I am really happy with it

A fun dice combat game that plays quickly and fluidly. For better or worse this is a solo game, unless you purchase one of the other character packs for each player, the benefit of this is that each pack has unique rules to better capture the feel of the character.

A fun little dice game, if not really a lot of content out of the box. Games of this take 10 minutes or less, and you're not going to see much variation from game to game. I like that each hero is slated to have their own variation on the Yahtzee mechanism for rolling their dice, and I vastly prefer Superman's ability over Batman's. Best played cooperatively, which you need more than one set for, but works really well solitaire as well.

(Initial Rating) For Soloplay: Quick and easy filler game. Setup in 30sec, playtime a couple of mins. Love the big, chunky and colourfull dice. Will have a look at the rest of the series.

Updated rating.
I really like the different dice rolling mechanisms of the different heroes and the parallel rolling.
Hoping for more and harder villains in future packs.

I didn't play hero dice solo. Catch Batman, Green Lantern, or Flash an you will have a easy to play dice game. Each Hero has its own dice-mechanism. Superman is probably the less powerful because he alwas has to fight against cryptonite and foes as well.

RATING: N/A
I'd consider this game if they added a female hero or two. And some villains, eventually, what's up with heroes always fighting heroes? Disney/Marvel is bad for not putting much fem a le product out, without prompting, alot of the time. DC could differentiate themselves. Beyond that Bratz looking heroines in highschool show. 

Once a woman's added,I'd want her and Supes.

An ok game, however I don't feel the theme, which is particularly sad, as the art is gorgeous.
Still it does not save the theme which feels pasted on.

So far only played it solo, it's quick, light and oh so hard to win! Trying to bank enough hits (Superman symbols) while avoiding or neutralizing kryptonite is maddening...especially when rolling multiple kryptonite on your final re-roll. Six dice with sides totaling: 11 heat vision - 10 kryptonite - 9 frost breath - 6 hits. The odds suggest that you can generally neutralize kryptonite IF you forego hits to accumulate heat vision or frost breath. Since the name of the game is "hits" they generally come in short supply, that's where the hero cards "help" you out (albeit temporarily). The difficulty aside, it's still a fun game but if you want a little more strategy in a solo dice roller I would recommend "Hostage Negotiator".

Got superman and batman.  Superman is 'easier'to learn initially.  Both sets play nicely.  Now also have the flash and green lantern.  Great series!
Play solo with one set, or with 2+ sets.Solo one set game 15 mins (1.2)

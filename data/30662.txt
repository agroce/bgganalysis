I was almost playing the game in so many occassions but eventually gave up - this' not a game! At most it's half-a-game. I bought the travel edition with the original idea to own a copy of this famous "game" but later on gave it to a friend (who stayed in Australia, came back occassionally and just learned about board games).

Nice travel version of the popular game.  I think all the tiles and meeples are the same size, so you are just gaining the bag.  Still nice to have.

RATING: 7.5
Good game, but this was the first modern board game we owned and so we played it a lot (pre-tracking).  I feel pretty done with it.  Maybe expansions would spice it up for us, but we would need to get the full-size base set first.

smaller pieces a bit more fiddly. But it's a great way to enforce a basic-set-only play.

RATING: 8
We really enjoy this game, but it can get frustrating when you really need a certain tile.  Recommend finding a high-friction material to use as a playing surface.  The travel version is actually quite nice because it's playable on a coffee table or similar small surface.

RATING: 7
I run against the tide on this one.  I'm not much into expansions for any game so I'm not bothered that the expansions don't work with this.  I think this is really the right size for Carc.

RATING: 8
I've come to prefer this version so much to the original and all its expansions that I've shed them from my collection.  Carcassone in its original simplicity - a clever, stunningly illlustrated, strategy game that plays in about an hour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I gave this a 10 as well as the original but for different reasons.
I like the fact that it keeps the games core, which is sometimes lost when people get into expansions.
I have many expansions for the original game and would hate to loose part of that big set, this way I can take it along with me and leave my original safe at home with the expansions.
my plan is to pack it in some sort of nice carry case, rather than just using the bag, I just want to do something creative.

Wouldn't this be good to have in the car when we go camping and out to the farm?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rated as a travel game -- I'd give the regular version of Carc a 9. The tiles and meeps are smaller, but still very manageable. The bag doubling as a score track is clever. Still, this can't be played in the back seat of a car, nor would it fit on an airplane seat-back tray, which are two situations that most often come to mind when I think 'Travel Game'. This is more like 'Carcassonne: Leaves More Room In Your Luggage Edition'.
For euro gaming in the aforementioned situations, I recommend the travel edition of Settlers.

RATING: 8
This is just like the original. Nothing is changed except the size. But the game aren't very much smaller so I have a problem to see the idea. And as long as you can't put in any of the expansions this won't get as high rating as the bigger one.

Why buy this one? The game itself rocks but the bigger is better.

RATING: 3
Buy the full game. The pieces in this travel edition are only slightly smaller than the original set. This means two things, ultimately - it isn't all that much more portable and it will never be compatible with the normal expansions. This version has none of the other common travel-related features, such as magnetic tiles/meeples to reduce sliding. (Magnetic Meeples! oh my.)

That said, I'd like to comment that our normal play set consists of the original game, Inns & Cathedrals, Traders & Builders, King & Scout, River 1 & 2, die Cartherer, and the mini-expansion from Games Quarterly magazine #11. All of these pieces from all of the sets fit into the original box with the original insert (without hiding pieces underneath.) The trick is to carefully lay the meeples flat in a ziplock sandwich baggie on top of the scoreboard. We almost always take it with us when traveling and have never had an issue with room.. although it could be further collapsed into a smaller package by removing the box from the equation.

The only thing I do like (and feel a bit envious of) is the scoreboard bag included in the travel set... We normally prefer to pull tiles from a bag, but this would not be possible if using the bag as a scoreboard. I can, however, see the advantage of having a cloth scoreboard, since it would be easier to pack. I may have to design such a thing from an old shirt and printer-friendly iron-on paper.

RATING: 7
I am not a huge Carcassonne fan, but as a gamer I feel like I should have a copy in my collection...And that's where the Travel Edition comes in. Being a different tile size, I don't feel drawn or compelled to expansions because really I feel this is a game where less is more. I know everyone likes to say "This is a must" or "I never play without this" but there's something to be said about a back to basics approach, it keeps things simple.

Classic Carcassonne with smaller pieces and a travel bag. I can't imagine how a game like Carcassonne could be made any more portable without turning to electronic devices. I generally prefer full-sized Carcassonne, but I'd recommend this for someone that travels with their games a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.1
I really enjoy Carcassonne and I love having travel editions of games and I use them quite often.  I was really looking forward to this game and I wondered how they would pull it off. However my two complaints are: The score track is on the bag!?  I use a bag to draw the tiles in the regular game, why didn't they include a separate track so we could use the bag to draw from is this version? Hopefully there's enough room in the box to add an additional bag. My second complaint is that maybe this wasn't the right game for a travel size. The orignal Carcassone is easily travel ready if you just put everything in a tile bag.

I've rated regular Carcassonne and 10, and rate this one lower only because it can't work with expansions.  I understand that the point is to have a smaller, more portable set of Carc, and for that, I appreciate it.  We'll definitely pack this one in our luggage next time we take a trip.

Just like normal Carcassonne, except the pieces are smaller and the scoring track is on the game bag. Worth it if all you have is the Carcassonne Big Box. Important note: as the tiles are physically smaller, you can't play with expansions, at least not easily.

A travel Carcassonne is a great idea.  It's a shame that they went with a slightly smaller version of the original.  It doesn't improve it's portabilty at all.  You can't play it on a plane/ in the car.

Same gameplay as the original Carcassonne, but with farmers scoring 3 points for every city. I forgot how elegant and fun the original gameplay was and this gives me a way to play it without sorting out all of the expansion tiles and lets me take it with me on a holiday.

RATING: 8
Same rating and comment as the original as it's the same game and the same tiles (just smaller). Very elegant in its simplicity. Pick up a tile, play a tile, score if you've completed an element you started earlier, place a meeple on one of the elements you've just placed to potentially score later. The key to its success is the claim now, score later feature - most tile layers you score with the playing of the tile itself. Combine that with offering people different elements to claim on each tile to offer choice, and fast turns to boot, and the game has broad appeal.

Travel Carcassonne's baby meeples are extremely cute! The game is extremely portable but the problem lies in where to place the tiles since the cloth bag acts as a scoring track :s. I think perhaps the scoring track should have remained as a board albeit baby sized. Another problem is the incompatibility with expansions.

Reise-Carcassonne is, as the name says, a Travel Edition of Carcassonne. 
The rules of the game are (mostly) the same, but there are some changes between the two editions: 
No Expansions: The tiles size of the Travel Edition is smaller than the regular game, so it is not possible to add any expansion for the regular game.
Le Sac as counting table: The game includes a bag for the tiles that is printed with a counting table.
Third Edition farm scoring: The Rio Grande edition features, for the first time, the current, Third Edition Hans im Glück farm scoring.

This is a fairly useless game.  It's miniaturized, but the pieces are neither magnetic nor pegged down, so I can't see how it's a travel edition. And I was interested in a "travel" edition for this.  Guess I still am, as this ain't it.

Such a good game! Kinda like battle Yahtzee. It plays extremely well as a 2-player. Looking forward to future heroes/releases from this team

RATING: 10
This is a fantastic game that reminds me of the best part of gaming -- the competitive nature! Its a wonderful PVP Arena style dice game that takes both strategy and luck in such a great balance. The characters are very well balanced, the material used is of the highest quality, and the box came with such outstanding organization. It took a whole 5 minutes to learn the rules of the game and I got going with my girlfriend and a few friends. It took about 15 minutes to play with 2 people and about 30-40 minutes with 4. I would recommend this game to anyone, both casual and hardcore gamers! You play a small hand, roll dice, cast your powers and defeat your opponents in the purest form of PVP! It is comparable to King of Tokyo in terms of challenging other players with its own unique yet simple mechanics. Wonderful game and worth every penny!

Let’s talk about Dice Throne!

When I came across Dice Throne on Kickstarter I backed it immediately. Initially I fell in love with the art. After reading the description and how the game was played I knew it was a game I wanted to own. 

As the fates would have it I backed the game when Nate and Manny had the Barbarian and Moon Elf as Print and Play characters. I ran to my local Staples with my Flash drive and got these printed out. 

What got me hooked on the game was how dynamic it was. The ability to upgrade your hero throughout the match, test fate going for that clutch ability, or just building yourself up with cards to unleash your ultimate felt incredible. 

Dice Throne is for all ages. It’s accesible enough that kids don’t get bogged down by rules and complex enough that adults can invest time into optimizing their play. At the end of the day though, you never know how the Dice will fall. 

P.S. - This is a game you want to get. I met Nate and Manny at Pax Unplugged and the vision they’ve got going forward makes me want to time travel to the future.

I was a backer on Kickstarter and have played the PnP edition quite a few times and every time the game has different twists and many different ways to play/strategize the charecters of the game.

Great game and one I cannot wait to finalize and be completed.

Update:
For me this game has been nothing short of amazeballs! Everywhere I go I bring my PnP to introduce the game to others and the response has always been great with numerous people ordering the game and or asking me to bring the game next time around. The more I have played the game the better I become at planning and strategizing as each character is so unique and requires a different approach. This game reminds me of playing Street Fighter and needing to learn each character because they are so different and require a different approach to fighting. 

I hope they do some competitions with this game as I would compete for certain.

Everything in this production is top notch. A beautiful game that plays well right out of the box. Eye candy is an understatement. 
I broke open the shrink wrap yesterday at a friend's house, the rules are clear and concise and we were playing in just a few minutes. It took us a little over an hour to play it through (3 on 3) the first time. The glossary on the back cover was very helpful.  We played it 3 times back to back. Turn order and combat resolution sped up as we became more familiar with our characters.
Dice Throne will hit the table again soon.

This game is a ton of fun.  Games can be quick and are generally very close.  Each character plays very differently which increases the replayabiity. My only complaint is the rules need a little refining and some of the language in the rules should change. (i.e. Targeted player in the role phase is different from Target player on cards.)  A lot of fun. Have bought a copy for a friend, and everyone I've played it with loved it.

I met Nate and Manny at PAXSouth2017, and played their test version like half the entire weekend. 
I backed this game on kickstarter, and haven't regretted it. The dice are GORGEOUS and the life/cp dials really make it pop. 
This game has so much flexibility and depth. There's multiple modes of play, and even the simplified learning mode is a blast. 
Every game I've played has been close, if not to the wire.  It's wonderfully asymmetrically balanced. 
Each hero feels unique and different yet powerful and it feels so good to get that one good roll you need. 

TL;DR: RIGHTEOUS COMBAT!

Full PnP, with all 6 initial characters from the first KS.  As far as game mechanics go, this is an ideal game for me; dice rolling determining your attach, mild to mid-level strategies, & not complex.  Learning is simple & games can take 15-30 minutes.  Get crushed?  Rerack & try again.  Excited to see where this franchise goes.

I SOOO wanted to like this game... had some great elements (I love me some custom dice!), and a great team behind it (and now a great publisher in Roxley).  Artwork and components are excellent, vac trays that hold one player's full set of stuff (cards, tokens, dials, dice) is a great idea and makes setup easy.

But 1v1/2v2 games just don't ever make it to my table...  If you like these type of games, I highly recommend trying this one.  But I ended up selling my copy because I just don't see it getting played in my group.

RATING: 6
An interesting Yahtzee combo making game for sure, but does seem a bit hyped.  Good replayability out of the box, since all 6 heroes play very differently. The artwork and graphic design are fantastic.  Not sure this is a long term keeper, but I do plan to get a few plays in at minimum just to get a feel for the different heroes.

Excellent component quality!

Whilst this game is not the most complex that works in its favour making it really accessible and has a really quick set up time. I love how the tokens sit in each of the individual character trays.

There is good variety in the characters and I cant wait to see what new characters they come out with in the future!

Definitely recommend this one!

I needed a game that wasn't as complicated as Gloomhaven and not as simple as King of Tokyo. Dice Throne fill that niche perfectly. A fun game that can be set up, played, and put away quickly (30-45 mins). Despite this fact, Dice Throne has the potential for deeper strategy for gamers looking for more depth. Highly Recommend!

I've been looking for a good 2-6 player game for awhile now and I found it! Dice Throne can be up and running within minutes and is super fun! It's not all luck of the dice either! The custom card deck that you get with each character has a lot to say about, not just your dice rolls, but everyone's! It can be frustrating at times when you hit a good roll and someone changes it... but it's all in the fun of the game! I am having so much fun with this game! You should check it out!

As far as dice rollers go this is a very good quick game. I think this one will replace King of Tokyo for me in my collection. It is slightly more complicated than KoT, but not by much. The different player count options give it a decent amount of variety.

Make no bones about it, Dice Throne is "battle" Yahtzee. Each player has a unique character and powers that activate by rolling certain set of dice faces. Additionally there are command points that players can use to change a die face or upgrade abilities on each board. Dice Throne is an excellent duel game. It plays very quickly, each character feels unique but also balanced, and it is the most engaging hobby board game implementation of the Yahtzee dice system I have seen. Dice Throne has good doses of strategy and luck, and it is an excellent light game.

I like playing the game a lot. However, I find some combinations to be more overpowered than others. Though our life points at the end are very near one another so this would suggest that the game is more or less balanced.

My issue on this is playing this on a multiplayer platform. I've yet to discover house rules that would balance out potential issues as I feel some archetypes are better at multiplayer games than others.

We sat down to try the game, and ended up playing 4 times (2 rounds of the same 2 sets of characters, twice...).  The instructions were super clear for (almost) everything, the box layout was absolutely brilliant (NOTE: PUBLISHERS - THIS IS HOW YOU DO A BOX GAMERS WANT!), and the game felt remarkably balanced every single turn.  This has gone from a "lets try" to an instant favourite.  I'll not only continue playing, but will recommend highly to anyone interested in a great head to head game.

We were kickstarter supporters and largely bought in due to it being a local company. We were so pleasantly surprised by how great this game turned out to be. Dice throne is played in our house 5-7 times per week assuming 3 people. This game is a great blend of push your luck and strategy. The game play is generally light and usually quick, short games are 15min and long games around an hour, a normal game for us is about 35min with setup/tear down. The game itself is a rather novel combination of King of Tokyo meets 7 Wonders. I have never player another game quite like Dice Throne. The game is structured around 6 unique heroes, that have genuinely unique styles of play. The creators did a great job balancing the characters such that no one is guaranteed to win in a given game. The themes for the characters are good, generally consistent and art is fantastic. The build quality of the game components has been great so far. From the linen card stock to the score/cp keepers and per character molded inserts, the parts are probably the best I have experienced in a board game. Overall this is a great game and I look forward to seeing more from Manny and Nate (the creators).

Dice Throne muscles in somewhere between King of Tokyo and MtG.  The game play is light, but engaging, with lots of excitement around rolling well.  The fighters all feel different with the abilities they bring.  The custom dice and vibrant player boards look great.  This is just a well-done game on all fronts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This rating is based on a 3 vs. 3 game, but I got 2 turns in as the other team did turns of 15 damage, 12 damage and 10 damage before I actually got to go. Saved points for a card that was meant to keep us alive, then a lower point card beat my card and we still lost. If you like dice rolling this game will be fun, will try again, but dice rolling AND random card draw is a huge drawback to strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
In 1v1 or 2v2, this game is outstanding. There's a good balance to the characters (though certain characters seem weak at first until you understand their nuances), and each character is different enough to keep the game enjoyable after many playthroughs. The components of the game are quite good, with generous linen finish throughout, and a clever removeable plastic tray system that allows for quick setup and tear down for each character. Even with sleeved cards, the small tokens sometimes don't stay in place in the trays, which is a minor annoyance that could be overcome with some small 2"x3" baggies. It doesn't get a 10 because the 5- and 6-player variants are not good at all (very slow, and the random targeting eliminates strategy in favor of a little more "fairness" in that players can't gang up on one player). Turns aren't very quick, so the large games suffer from extended periods of downtime. The randomness of targeting can also mean a certain player gets eliminated rather quickly and has to watch for an hour while everyone else plays on. 3 player is ok, but the 1v1 and 2v2 modes are where it truly shines. Between the dice and card draws, there is a fair bit of luck involved, but the smaller games can be won by clever play and resource management even when the dice don't fall in your favor. I can't get enough of the game though, and the Facebook and Discord communities are excellent as well. Pick it up and you won't regret it!

I now own the real deal (Champion Edition no less) and it was so worth the wait!  I wish I could rate this game higher than a 10, as it exceeded my expectations ten fold!  The components are super nice, but the game...the GAME!!!  That's where the real treasure is.  This game is super addictive, fast, intense, deeply strategical (yet easy to learn and teach), and extremely versatile with how you can play it right out of the box (1v1, 2v2, 2v2v2, 3v3 and 3-6 player free-for-all)!  All 6 characters have their own unique play style and are extremely well balanced.  This is one fantastic game!

This is the perfect game for a family with kids say 6+ or adults who are up for playing some beer and pretzel gaming with playful reading and taunting adding to the fun.  There is a lot of interaction between players which can create a lot of funny/fun moments.  The ability to play 1x1, 1x1xq, 2x2, 3x3, 2x2x2 makes the game very flexible.  I brought it on a ski trip with friends and their 12 year old and it absolutely captivated them.  My friend is so grateful that he has a way to play with his tween in a way they both really enjoy that he offered to buy my copy on the spot (his son sugested that they get a new copy else the deal would have gone down.)

I thought I would not like this game at all. But turns out it's quite fun, and the production is impressive for a first time publisher. 

Unfortunately the rulebook is a mess. Most of what you need to play is present, but it's format and organization makes learning and teaching the game a headache, if it weren't for BGG and the relative simplicity of the gameplay, I would have given up on learning the game.

When you have gleaned all that you can from King of Tokyo, move on to Dice Throne. Cool combos, card play, and a variety of play modes make the game a next logical step for those who enjoy dice combat. The production is exceptionally well done. Terrific, unique dice for each character, a set of useful inserts for each player's gear, and art that is bright and interesting. The rule book could use another edit, perhaps this will be addressed in future editions.

So glad i backed this.  The gameplay feels like a street fighter simulation with the different characters "combos" and counter moves. Its a little more yahtzeeish than i normally like but this is going to stick in my collection for its fast, simple, and enjoyable gameplay.  

Also - kudos to the creators of the box and inserts. Sleeved cards fit beautifully in the trays and the game literally takes 30 seconds to setup thanks to those awesome character trays. A++

Usually I don't like luck based games, but this game just hit all the right notes for me.  The time to play this game is in a nice sweet spot between 20 - 40 minutes.  Even though the main attack is based off yahtzee (The luck part). There are so many things you can do with your cards to manipulate those dice rolls.  Knowing when to use your CP and save some CP for later is what makes this game so much more tactical than King of Tokyo or New York.  Taking the throne and killing off all other players just feel so damn good.  Even if you are one getting killed, you can always hope your defensive roll can deal enough damage to kill the attacker as well so that the attacker doesn't get the win.  One of my top 10 games of all time.

A fun light game game that you can easily play several times in a row.  Each class has a different feel and even though it is a "Yahtzee" style game, with the cards and the differences in the face sides there is an amount of strategy that goes with the game.

There is no twisting of the arm to get me to play this, though I have only played 1v1.  Have not played 2v2 or 3v3.

Enjoyable and I believe there is an expansion or a KS expansion coming soon for more classes.

good quality boards and dice as well.

Received prototype, very enjoyable game, I love how unique each hero is, each provides meaningful choices because of their individual class based strengths and weaknesses. After a couple dozen games each hero feels balanced to the rest, I haven't felt handicapped by the hero I had in any match up. Very well developed game, I'm very excited about the future for this game.

RATING: 9
Very easy to pick up. Can be complex for some, but not complicated.  It's very enjoyable, super replayable, and plays quickly.  A fun game to introduce friends to board games.  Basically a mini-RPG combined with Yahtzee dueling style.  Artwork is incredible. The dice looks cool with the characters, and even the storage is nice for easy setup.  My only wish is that the status effect mats were a little thicker.  They can get worn down quickly.  A great game!

RATING: 9
I rate games like I do movies. It's very hard for me to give anything a perfect 10 (Except Gloomhaven, because holy ____ that game is perfect.) But this one definitely deserves a 9. It has an amazing duality of being super accessible so that I can convince non-hardcore gamers to play with me, but then it is rich and strategic so that even serious gamers can keep coming back to it. Each character is unique and fun, and even with very different play styles, the games always feels well balanced. People have compared it to King of Tokyo, but I really don't like the complete randomness of KoT. Dice Throne fixes all my with issues KoT (or other dice-driven games) by having lots of different abilities to choose from, as well as cards and combat points to strengthen/alter your rolls. So unless you're going for a really difficult roll, you can usually end your turn with something meaningful. 

Dice Throne is a way fun game that has me itching to play it again and again, and I can't wait for the release of new characters and game modes.

So the rating is mostly based on how much fun I've had and mostly ignores my detailed thoughts. I find the game a great deal of fun. I don't find the complexity ratings to be terribly accurate, and the play styles don't take as much learning curve development as expected, but the game is best played with people who want to relax instead of think critically for 3 hours. The art is well done and the box is well designed (minus something to hold the tokens, but jewelry bags work well), the flow of play is solid and straight forward and honestly, learning even the more complex characters isn't too challenging. Is this the best game ever? No, but I'm good to keep playing it and I'm glad to share it with my friends.

So it's Yahtzee, right? Well, yeah, but still not. The comparison to King of Tokyo is apt, but only because that's chucking dice three times.

The game is SHORT. You teach it in 3 minutes, and play it in 30 tops. Every game is different simply due to draws, yet the uniqueness of each character always shines through. You never feel hampered by dice luck thanks to the variety of actions, and die manipulation. Even if you were, the game is over and you can just play again.

Ultimately, this is a fast and fun game that really took me by surprise. I instantly backed season 2.

I really enjoy this game. At first, it seemed as tough the characters were unbalanced, but, as we played multiple games, we found the built-in randomizers did an excellent job of allowing every hero to shine in their own way.

Can’t wait for more heroes to be added to the base set to expand the horizons.

Additionally, if you like dice, the hero specific dice (5 dice for each hero) are extremely well done.

This is the type of game that will grow on you and will take a few plays to show you the depth behind it (I'm not necessarily calling this a super deep game, but there is quite a bit to consider during play).  The overall strategy and tactics won't be immediately obvious to you, unless you take the time to study the special abilities, deck, and dice available to each hero.  

Yes, there is some luck - random card draws and dice rolling.  So, if you can't handle luck ruining your chance at victory, stay away from this game.  However, if you can handle it, the game offers various way to deal with the luck thrown your way.  

During the game, you'll be doing more than just rolling dice and hoping for the best.  Each ability requires a different set of symbols or numbers.  You'll be calculating the various probabilities between each re-roll.  Depending on your opponent's character (due to their defensive abilities and status effects), you may also be considering which abilities are too risky to go for right now and factoring that into the decisions you make on your re-roll.  There will also be quite a bit of decisions to make when it comes to your CP and deck of cards.  The available CP can be tight so you have to actively manage how you're using it.  Before you enter into your roll phase, have you accounted for any potential cards you may want to play?  Which cards did you toss to make sure you had adequate CP available?  Which cards are too valuable this match to toss for CP?  

Each characters offers a different play style due to the dice, abilities, and status effects available to them.  For example, on the Shadow Thief, I like to use part of the early game to build up CP, then shoot for a large straight to deal tons of damage with the CP I collected.  Of course, if I have an opponent with a full stack of evasive tokens, then I need to work on smaller attacks to tempt them to use the evasive tokens up, then go for a big attack.  The decisions you make are going to be affected by your opponent's decisions, as well.  This makes the game highly re-playable and matches aren't decided until the very last roll. It also allows for a ton of depth, if you play the same opponent over and over.  You start to get a feel for how they'll react in certain situations, which allows for a bit of mind games, as well.

If you enjoy head to head combat games, you'll likely enjoy this one, too.  Rules are fairly straightforward,  The characters are all unique.  Smart plays are going to win out over luck a majority of the time.  

If you enjoy King of Tokyo, I think you'll enjoy this, as well.  However, I don't think not liking King of Tokyo means you won't like Dice Throne.  While they share similarities due to the Yahtzee mechanism, you have far greater control and more things to consider in Dice Throne.

My wife and I backed this game on KickStarter just to add another fun 2-player game to our collection to play when the kids go to sleep.  We play the PnP game 2-3 nights a week because we love it so much.  We are excited to get the actual game because the actual Dice Throne dice will make the game play a whole lot better.  The game is a ton of fun and we are 100% satisfied with our purchase.  The art work is great and the game play changes each time we play.

Full disclosure: I am the co-designer of the game. However, my rating is NOT a disingenuous inflated lie. I designed a game for myself--something that combines all of my favorite elements and themes, in a fast paced package. Something that was both accessible and strategic. Something that I *wanted* to play. And after COUNTLESS hours of play, Dice Throne is still genuinely the game that I want, more than any other, to put on the table. In-fact, Manny Trembley and I will often stop other work that we should be doing, purely because a game of Dice Throne against each other sounds much more enjoyable :)

Feeling very pleased with this purchase. I missed the Kickstarter, but pre-ordered. It has a Yahtzee mechanism in that on offensive rolls, you can reroll dice up to three times to make combos for more damage or abilities. I think this makes the game more accessible to newbies, and introduces some interesting strategy into it. Beware! You don't draw up to a full hand every round. Don't discard something you may want later.

this game is a light weight game play of fantasy characters challenging other characters.  The game is basic in lay.

I have a blast playing this game and look forward to playing it again at the conclusion of each game. I enjoy press-your-luck dice games such as King of Tokyo and Dice Throne is no exception.  However, Dice Throne takes the genre to a whole new level by increasing the player interaction each turn through defence rolls and the ability to play cards.  I have found Dice Throne to be completely engaging the entire game with a rich strategy component that is more than just roll and see what I get.  The game play is fantastic but beyond that the flavor of the game that comes from the artwork, the dice, and the other components makes the gaming experience superb.  I have been telling my friends and co-workers about this game and have introduced it to various people on game nights.  The only thing thoughtless about Dice Throne is my gift ideas for friends in 2018, Dice Throne for all!

Dice Throne is a fun fast action "push your luck" dice game where you have a hand of cards that can change the outcome of rolls. It can be played 2 - 6 players as a free for all, or with teams, 2v2, 3v3, or even 2v2v2.

I discovered it at PAX Unplugged where my first game as a 2V2 with pooled health. Since then I have played it at home and at PAX South.

It is engaging even when it is not your turn as your hand can provide options to change things as others are playing.

In Dice Throne you adopt a character of various classes: Barbarian, Moon Elf,  Monk, Pyromancer, Paladin, and Shadow Thief. You get 50 health points to start as you get ready to battle your friends.
You get roll 5 dice and can re-roll the ones you want 2 more times in the attempt to match the combinations of symbols for different abilities. ("Like Yatzee!, but more fun" my friend said when I was teaching him.) The more difficult the odds of getting the right dice for the ability, the bigger the impact. 
Each class has different mechanics for attacking and defending. The Barbarian heals, the Moon Elf mitigates half the damage, and the Monk earn tokens that can be used for a 33% chance of evading all the damage.
Additionally you are drawing cars into your hand, and building up Combat Points in order to activate most cards. Cards can force a re-roll of dice, allow you to change 1 or 2 dice to any outcome you wish, or can be used to evolve your abilities to the next level (among other things).

With 4 players we played for about an hour.
We did hit a bit of odd luck that knocked one player out of the game about 1/2 way through, so she was no longer as engaged when she could no longer play. This seemed more of an anomaly because most of the games I have played or watched were fairly evenly matched down to the last 5-10 minutes.

The main character boards are all thick stock, and there is a complete deck of cards and set of dice for each character. Tokens are provided to status effects, and some are shared between classes. 

I highly recommend this game. We had a lot of memorable moments and even started roll playing are characters a bit as we got into the mood of the game.

I made the mistake of passing this up on Kickstarter, and I will not do that again with any future expansions or upgrades. This game is amazing. 6 characters and a huge variety of game modes provides a lot of replay variety and value. Each character has their own unique feel and play style. These can be mixed and matched in the team modes for some great combinations and synergy. 

One of the best aspects of this game is the ability to customize your abilities and manipulate the dice rolls. You choose which abilities to focus on and then you can guide your dice rolls by using the action cards to give more control than a lot of press your luck style games allow. 

So far I have played this game with my wife, my 8 year old, and my 6 year old. Everyone enjoyed it and we will be battling it out for the dice throne many more times!

Currently have the Full PnP (Print and Play) my wife and I sat down to a game over the weekend. It took all of 10 minutes to figure out the rules and about 30 seconds to realize how much fun this game is. 
The thrill of the game is trying to go for the big roll to do some really powerful things to your opponent. But are the dice in your favor can you make that straight or get all 6's to do you Ultimate skill? 
The game is fairly fast paced and doesn't take a lot to pick and play. We have only played the Moon Elf and Barbarian but we are looking forward to take out the other characters

Quick to learn. Quick to play. Excellent variety. My two sons and all others I have intruded this to or have watched us play at the local gaming store have thoroughly enjoyed each and every game! This has quickly become a go-to game for when we find ourselves with 30 minutes !!!

Awesome components, love the individual trays. Simple yet efficient "duel" game. Each character plays differently and there so much potential for more characters.

Love it

Such an amazing game. Unique characters. Tense back and forth dice combat. Power upgrades and instant abilities through card play. The components are incredible, the artwork top shelf, and the fun factor is through the roof. I was shocked by just how much fun this is.

RATING: 8.4
Overall: Fun & casual Yahtzee-like game that has potential. 8.4/10

Gameplay: Fun, short & sweet. Game shines for 1v1 games.  Luck plays a bit more factor then I would have liked. Some characters feel a bit stronger then others. 

Components: Everything in this game is of exceptional quality. The Kickstarter swirled dices and counters were amazing. Game also has great inserts. One minor letdown would be a lack of art on the cards. 

Replay Value: 6 Unique Champions gives it moderate replayability. I believe more character expansions are on the way, however what this game really needs is for a 
Coop or Campaign mode.

Described as Magic: the Gathering meets Yahtzee, the game pits one-on-one, teams, or free-for all with dice.  One of the issues being resolved for season 2 is the targeting for a free-for all, where dice rolls can prevent the leader from being attacked and have two weaker players all hitting each other.

Light, generally fairly quick, it's a good filler but I wouldn't want to play too often.

I sadly missed the Kickstarter but I have had the pleasure of playing the print and play as well as countless hours on TTS. Over the weekend, I finally got to play th full physical version of The game. This game is amazing. This game is being added to my collection as soon as possible and I will NOT miss the chance for the season 2 Kickstarter launch. (14 FEB if you haven’t already heard) I have also had a chance to interact with one of the developers and I can tell you that they are great guys as well. All in all, hard to to this one.

Dice throne is one of the most engaging pick up and play board games I have ever played. The way the game plays out as combat yahtzee has to be one of the most fun games that I have ever played. Most games are about 20min long but can last upwards to an hour depending on which characters are being played. With 6 characters to play as the game always feels fresh, and with more characters coming soon its no surprised that this game has taken the top spot in my favorite board games. The ability to pull it out and teach someone the basics in a few minutes is spectacular, and with a high skill cap the versatility of the game really starts to shine. 

I look forward to seeing the future of this game which expansions coming out, and more planned for the future. This game and team have a very bright future ahead.

Has replaced Dice Masters for me. Great characters that all play different and at the same time it is very well balanced! Pretty rare that someone just demolishes their opponent. Looking forward to more characters coming out!

Fun from 2-6 players. Extremely easy to learn and teach. I taught 4 friends at the bar, none of them board gamers, and we were playing in just the time it took to handout boards and dice and shuffle the decks. They all asked me to setup another day when we could "play games like this all day". Highly recommended. I tell people it's Yahtzee with killing and they jump right in!

I first played this game at PAX South 2017, and the game immediately struck me as both creative and easy to learn. I kickstarted the game and received my copies after very excellent customer service managed to track my moves this year across two countries. We have spent hours per evening playing this, and found all the play versions to be enjoyable and fun to play. We mixed it up a little by drawing random hero boards to play, which forced us to learn the different play styles. While luck still plays into it (I lost within the first round of a 5 man free for all due to poor luck in targeting rolls), skill also allows one to turn a bad situation into a better one, and keeps the game exciting and engaging. I've recommended this game to my friends, and am very glad we played this at PAX.

I joined the Kickstarter for this gem of a game.  I've yet to play with adults, but my kids love this game.  We've played through several 1v1 games, and I even set up a mini-tournament so we could all get in on the fun.  My boys are 5 and 7, and are both excellent readers, so they are able to handle most aspects of DT.  The more complex characters are still difficult, but if they stick to playing the Barbarian or Moon Elf it is a pretty fair match.  In fact, the five-year-old has beat me three of the four times we've played.  I definitely recommend DT for fans of press-your-luck games, or even those who enjoy pvp on fantasy MMO video games.

Not sure why this game is well rated, considering there's just short of no strategy or even player control involved. Sure, there are cards you can choose to play at times, but not many, and even those are often canceled out by a bad dice roll after playing it.

This is a wonderful game that my group always enjoys. It plays almost like a combat-oriented Yahtzee with strategic character elements. Each character has a strong theme that makes them very different and lends to high replayability. I love the artwork, components, and designs as well. They are all thought out and excellent. This game is already one of my top 5 favorite games, and it's only on Season 1. I can't wait to see where they take it with all the planned future expansions.

This game has virtually zero setup. Unique decks and dice for each character. Explains rules is under 5 minutes! Balance between fun, strategy, and luck is perfect. Time to play one game is around 20-30 minutes. That’s key for those with young family like myself! Can’t wait to see future releases!!

A fantastic game! It combines the best of old school Yahtzee with a sweet modern card game duel. The characters and their skills are diverse and play very differently. A great game!

This game is extremely fun and the potential is high for expansions and other addons to increase the fun factor, customization, and overall ways to play. Loving the core game. I play it as often as possible with friends. I brought to a DnD session and we ended up playing THIS GAME all night instead of playing the session. Each character feels unique and has a different strategy to it. Very much looking forward to the future as well.

Absolutely love this game. The balance is unbelievable. It doesn't matter which champ with/against, you will no doubt have a great match! On top of all that, you have multiple ways to play the game. 1v1, 2v2, 2v2v2, 3v3, FFA, etc. The dice rolling brings in a bit of luck, but the card actions combat the randomness of dice rolls and draw on strategies (some cards manipulate dice). Each champion has multiple ways to play them. Do you want to utilize your positive/negative status tokens or go for the heaviest damage you can in the least amount of turns?

The creators, Nate and Manny, have spent countless hours taking the feedback from their followers seriously and bringing the game to where it is today. With Season 2 around the corner and talk of plans for lots of new things to come, I see Mind Bottling Games staying around the gaming scene for a long time.

Let's be honest about what this is and reduce the shill and fan backer pumped numbers.  It's a card combat game that uses Yahtzee mechanics.  Fast and fun with easy rules but there's nothing innovative here.  Reasonably priced and with six decks that play differently you'll get your money's worth before moving on.

This is my current go to game. It is easy to learn, but has lots of depth. It does an excellent job of blending card strategy with dice rolling. The characters are balanced well and so far each game I have played has been close. Highly recommended.

We love this game. It's easy to teach the basics so very accessible to new players but takes more to master each character. Some characters we have found to be more overpowered than others but perhaps time and more experience will balance them. Overall, we're having a lot of fun with this game

RATING: 8
Mi juego favorito de escaramuzas con miniaturas. Reglamento sencillo pero que dota al juego de cierta profundidad a la hora de desarrollar las batallas. Al contrario que en Warhammer cada miniatura mueve y ataca de forma independiente. Con pocas miniaturas por bando y un buen escenario se pueden dar interesantes partidas. Hay que meterse un poco en el juego pues viene bien recordar los atributos de cada miniatura par no tener que estar consultando los manuales y ralentizar el juego.

Dumbed-down system; value lies in the bits for Balin's tomb and cost effectiveness of a plastic Fellowship set and a cave troll in plastic instead of metal.

This is the way Games Workshop should have presented their LOTR material all along: nice plastic sets for each movie with the principal characters, a decent number of bad guys, a few pieces of representative terrain, and a streamlined set of the rules. As the system gained popularity, introduce the metal miniatures and gradually build up the rules for those wanting more complete armies, monsters, secondary characters, and re-issues of the heroes in different poses. I know many were disappointed when the base sets first appeared and there were no heroes from the films in them. To get the base rules, a small set of opposing forces, and some heroes was easily doube the cost of this  Mines of Moria set. A missed opportunity.

GW mini pusher with fig sculpts based on Peter Jackson's LoTR movies, excellent figs, GW Warhammer combat rules essentially

The game is too simple and shallow for my tastes.  Yet, the figures are quite impressive and there are better rule-sets to use them with (perhaps Saga).

This is a really good box set to get into GW's LOTR game. Comes with a complete fellowship and enough gobbos and a troll to start a moria army. the terrain pieces are good and the mini rule book is a gem.

Very rules intensive game.  Manual was thick and somewhat complicated.  Game typically took about two hours to complete without much tension or payoff.  Painting the miniatures was great fun and gave the game a great semi-personalized visual style.

Bought used to use with A Song of Blades and Heroes. Assembled, unpainted. 

Update: Painted. Rate it a solid 6 as a game. If you include the value for miniatures and terrain, it might be more.

While I enjoy the base rules for the four scenarios, I like the advanced rules in the core rulebook better. The combat system is inventive even if it is based on dice rolls and ability numbers. 

I am just as excited about painting the figures as I am about playing the game.

GW finally accepted that this rules system works well for a small band of heroes fighting a horde of monsters, and ditched the "mass combat" emphasis that they previously used for their LotR games.

I like both: painting and playing the game.
Excellent as introduction for beginning painters and players. Good value for your money.

The "starter kit" of sorts for the Lords of the Rings Strategy Battle Game by Games Workshop. Comes with a nice set of simplified rules, and another semi-complete full rulebook.

For the price this is worth it if you are interested in obtaining the figures within. You get the entire Fellowship, 24 Moria Goblins, 1 Cave troll, and some terrain (a door, 4 pillars, Balin's tomb, rubble, treasure chest, etc) to recreate the battles in Moria.

The base rules are fine, although the die rolling can get tedious.  Mixing in will and spells makes things too complicated for my taste.

Now this is a great package from GW.  You get everything you need to start playing LotR straight away.  I don't like the way LotR scales to larger games, but for what this pack is, it's great.

In total agreement with Brady Severns' comments.  This is how GW should have done LOTR from the start.  Their recent drop in sales might not have been so sharp or even a drop at all, if they'd done up a decent starter like this.

$35.00 on Ebay. I think I got a very good deal on this one. I enjoy building plastic models so maybe someday I'll ACTUALLY put the components together, paint them up and PLAY THE GAME.  Oh, so LITTLE time!!!

The starter set that accompanied Games Workshop's big hardcover rulebook for [thing=28805][/thing].

New players were introduced to the rules in several small scenario's that followed the Fellowship of the Ring while being attacked by Goblins in the Mines of Moria. This culminated in the bigger battle of Balin's Tomb.

This was a decent starter box.

A very affordable way to get into miniature gaming and you don't necessary need to buy any more figures or such to play Moria. Basically all is here.
Though I have to say 4 scenarios is not much and I suppose without anything extra this would soon get pretty boring.

Just rec'd Jun 5, '08, painted the Fellowship June 7.
Terrain pieces are nice; figures are clean and required little prep to get them ready for undercoating.
Rules are short and clear, and quite minimal, esp. for a miniatures game.
One knock against the boxed set is a lack of a player aid card of any sort (unless you count the incomplete one printed at the back of the rulebook which wasn't designed for photocopying).
After first couple plays, like the way the game plays; the Might, Fate and Will rules add a distinct element to the game that adds some strategy to the dice rolling going on.

I bought this for too much money. I really like lord of the rings with a passion. I loved the '78 cartoon when I saw it in the early 80s. I've loved the book since I read it when I was 12. I've read it so many times since. I loved the films (except for the Frodo character - he was poor). I know I definitely like it more than Star Wars and I really love star wars.

I really liked the Mines of Moria section. 
I really enjoyed painting the models from the set.

But the gameplay sucks - I think, in part, because it relies on fantastic scenery to actually make it feel like a game.

This is the same game, I mean identical rules to [gameid=28805]. The difference is this is a boxed set with minatures and dice included as opposed to sold seperately. The rulebook for this is a smaller softcover with same rules but leaving out the Collecting, Painting & Modelling sections.

You get a fair load of gubbins for your shiny pennies here: terrain, rules, miniatures of the entire Fellowship, a cave troll, and a clutch of Moria goblins. Oh, and a ring thing.

The rules are okay. Quite good, actually.

However, I only bought this for the terrain elements. I admit it, guv'. Fair cop.

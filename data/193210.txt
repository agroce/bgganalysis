A little more think-y than [b]Qwixx[/b], but not too much.  I like that it's got a little more player interaction, in terms of the common dice.  And the repeat play revealed a deeper level.  Not one of my favorite dice games, but worthwhile to play.

I wanted a "roll and write" game for my collection and this one seemed to be the one with the most strategic choices involved. A push your luck element as well. For a dice rolling game, there can be quite a bit of analysis when choosing what dice to pick up and add to your chart. I'm impressed with what the designers have accomplished with this game.

Souvenir from Strasbourg 2017.

My very first "official" roll and write! These games really gained in popularity after we had moved away from our FLGS, so I never saw them on store shelves (and still don't). For very reasonable prices and on the shelf in Philibert, I couldn't resist. Co-designed by Cathala definitely caught my eye and we really enjoy this one. Definitely best with 2-3 players.

I was really surprised by this one.  I didn't expect much, and didn't think it could compete with the other roll n write games that seem to give you more to do with your rolls (e.g., La Granja).  And yet, here it is, a nice and simple dice roller with a surprising amount of tough decisions to make every round.  Great use of tempo and of PYL.  This will stick around.

A mid-range roll-and-write. Better than Qwixx and Rolling America, not as good as Qwinto or Saint Malo. Unlike some such games, you cannot use the dice that other players roll, so the downtime is maybe greater than average.

This is a roll the dice and fill in the spaces on your sheet game. This is lighter than [thing=195528]La Granja: The Dice Game – No Siesta![/thing], it's more along the lines of [thing=183006][/thing] or [thing=180198][/thing]. 

On your turn you grab 3 dice from the bag and roll them. Then you (and only you) choose either a single colour or a single value and take all of those dice. You have a grid with values running vertically and the colours running horizontally. You sum the pips of the dice and then write this into the grid, I'll skip over the details of exactly how you do this, but it does manage to produce some interesting decisions.

You then discard the dice you used, however any other dice stay in a common pool in the middle of the table. The next player takes 3 dice and rolls them, adding them to the common pool, then selects dice. This continues until someone has completed a certain subset of available spaces on their sheet. 

I like the decisions around which dice to take. There are always several choices and among your concerns is what you're leaving for the next player. It's a super fast game 15-20 minutes. I have found that I really enjoy these types of games.

I love dice drafting, and this game makes a perfect filler out of it: simple enough to play with family, enough puzzle-ness to be interesting to gamers. Between the line multiplying, the speed of filling, and the two directions for filling the score sheet, there are quite a few things to consider when deciding what to take. I'm not sure if this will stay around forever, as fillers often just come and go, but I'm interested in finding out.

I like pretty much all dice game with a score pad. This one didn't add much to qwixx and quinto that I have already played a lot. Dice stars has a mechanic that builds a pool of dice that you add and pick dice from. To me it didn't make sense to ever roll less than three dice. If you can reset the pool always do it. The choices were mostly obvious in this game. There are better games in this genre.

[b]Dice Stars[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]8[/b]):[/COLOR]  

[i]Dice Stars is one of the roll and write games that has managed to stick around in our collection; this is due in large part to Dice Stars being one of the more thinky roll and write games out there. Dice Stars has one of the most well designed score pads out there which allows for flexibility when choosing dice to score. There is a lot to consider when playing considering you are just filling in a score sheet. This may also be Dice Stars' Achilles heal, whereas Qwixx and Noch Mal can be taught in less than a minute, there is much more to explain in Dice Stars. Still, I highly recommend Dice Stars if you are a fan of roll and write games and you're looking for a deeper game play experience [i](all of this is in regards to roll and write games)[/i].[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]If this list is any evidence I am always buying and trying new dice games. I heard about this post Essen and was intrigued since the scoring was quite different from some of my favorites (Qwixx, Qwinto and Rolling America are at the top of my list). I'm always fascinated by a designer's ability to create a game with just dice. 

The set up of the scoring sheet is quite clever because only a portion of it needs to be filled to trigger the end game, but there is more space which could allow you to rack up some more points. There is a solid push your luck element which could end up canceling out a row of points. 

I'm not going to go into a whole rules explanation, there are plenty of good videos already so if you like dice fillers check this one out. There are some clever twists in the game play, a solid push your luck element and marking your points on the score sheet is a fun puzzle to solve. This does make Dice Stars a bit less intuitive than games like Qwixx or even Noch Mal, which are both definitely easier for non gamers to grasp right away, but I appreciate the added depth (comparatively speaking, Dice Stars is still a light dice filler) and is the reason I am initially rating it higher than Noch Mal.

Good fun games in the Qwixx genre. Maybe a little too long with more than 2 seeing that unlike Qwixx & Co. players don't get to take advantage of the active player's rolls so there is more downtime in this one and players have to wait for their turn. Other than that, a solid dice game.

Better than Qwixx and Rolling America/Japan by quite a bit.  It also draws comparisons to Qwinto and I am not sure which I like better.  There are points in favor of each.  Qwinto features simultaneous play whereas Dice Stars does not and Dice Stars can drag a bit due to occasional AP issues when there are a lot of dice to choose from on the table.  For this reason, I think Dice Stars is best as a two player game.  I would not play with four as down time would be too much for a game of this type.  But one issue I had with Qwinto was that often good moves early can be somewhat obvious and score sheets can be identical for several turns.  That will not happen with Dice Stars.  If you like "fill in your score sheet" dice games and you play a lot of 2 player games, I would definitely recommend picking this up.

This was a very hard game to figure out a strategy on the first play through. That is going to make a quick filler dice game harder to get to the table. The game is good though. Interesting strategy of drafting the dice and taking stars.

RATING: 6
whoa -- actual choices!  And the custom dice are subtly arranged in a way that matters.

Best at 2 players.  With more than 2, there is too much downtime and not enough planning.  The robot player in solo tends to drive you to just always draw 1 die and plod to victory.

update:  the choice of how many dice to roll is much less interesting than it first appears, and the rest of the game mostly falls into mechanical place.  You mostly just do the obvious thing, and home the dice line up right.  There are some real choices (and more illusory ones) but ultimately it only has half a dozen games in it before you've seen it all.

first few games:  7/10
next few games:  6/10
after 7+ games:  5/10

There's more and more Qwixx rip-offs and this is yet an other one. Roll some dice and cross off some stuff on a score sheet. At the end we score every item and make the total. So nothing new here, but it works great and the dice selection and the stars are a very nice touch.

RATING: 7
[thing=193210][/thing] is a quite easy and simple dice game: players add dice to a pool and take either all dice of a given number, all dice of the same color, or all dice showing stars. These are used to score in different ways - how this works is easier to explain in person than in writing, but basically taking several dice make some parts of your scoring sheet be blocked by an X, but others worth the added value of all the dice taken - and the stars are used to double the amount of points given in a line, but if the stars spaces of that line aren't completed until the game ends, that line will be worth 0 point.

In short, [thing=193210][/thing] is a push your luck type of game - you draw dice from the bag (from 1 to 3), roll them and decide the best use for what you have in the pool of dice - what you don't use pass to the next player. Then, accordingly with what you take, you write in your scoring sheet. Play proceeds until someone completes all the normal spaces (there are extras) in his sheet, 

Overall, [thing=193210][/thing], even with the big role of luck on it, is quite pleasant, since is rather lively, with low downtime, decisions (often easy) and the tension of trying to get lucky in order to double the points with the stars or losing everything. As dice games go, [thing=193210][/thing] isn't among the best, but is far from worst and I would play it often.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initial impression:
Most dice fillers tend to be on the lighter end - this one though is trickier and requires a bit more thought, at least durng your first couple of plays.  There are a couple of variables to consider beside picking dice and crossing out number. First,  the distribution of dice is not all equal among the colors. Some colors are more represented and the pip distribution in these dice also vary. For example, the orange dice have 2 stars while others have only one. This matters when considering how many to pull from the bag. Next, deciding whether to select a column or row to fill is important to pull off high scores. Row scoring based on same numbers doesn't yield many points, but easier to predict. The column scoring is devious. You get points for summing up all the dice of the same color, but the resulting sum can really catapault your scores particularly if you can get the multiplier going your way. Finally, the multipliers themselves are worth some thought. Getting them means and all or none approach. As you can see, the filler is a little heavier than your standard dice chuck-fest.

The general consensus is that Dice Stars is best with 2-3 players due to AP. In my  plays, 4 players aren't that bad. Sure there is longer lag between moves but I think they are manageable. Moreover, having 4p means the end game scenario isn't as clear cut. With 2, you can easily spy and determine your opponent's board and how to play our your moves. With 4, things are dicier. Each move you take is a gamble and could be your last move. Given that, do you take a set of stars to score the multipliers or play it safe and get more points off your standard grid? 

Overall a decent game and have to see if the game stands the test of time.

Surprisingly clever for a dice-super filler. The shared pool management makes the game, and having the game end with the first player who decides to take a *penalty* is fascinating. One of the better dice-filler games out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a game that's going to suffer in the ranking because it's a dice filler with obtuse rules which is not the kind of game that plays well on the fly at a typical game night.  You can teach Qwixx in 3 mins and a serious gamer will get it and play well immediately. Dice Stars requires 2 to 3 games before that happens. After that the rules become easy and strategy is apparent. Also, this is a 3p max game with 2p being best. This in fact a great 2p filler for couples who play the same games on a regular basis.

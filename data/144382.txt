What a shockingly low rating for a surprisingly heavy tile-laying spatial puzzle game... It's got that neat thing where you build infrastructure for your opponents to use (or to be forced to use)

Good fun with 2 players, although I'd expect 3 is ideal. It would get cutthroat with 4.

RATING: 2
The game feels broken. Bonus points (quests?) are not balanced at all and many times a player doesn't have control over them at all. Some are super easy, some feel impossible. It's possible that resources get totally blocked making many buildings unplayable. There's no reason to build canal to connect resources to canal network as you can't know if you will gain any benefit from it. The grid feels too small at least for 4 players.

As a tile-laying game, this title provides something interesting to work with - future locations and connections.  While on the surface this sounds like all tile-laying games, this feels different in this game for some reason.  Maybe it's because the tile shapes are not all identical.  Maybe it's because the scoring is linked so tightly with which tiles come together.  Maybe its actually because this tile-laying game's theme actually feels like it comes into play instead of just something printed on the tiles.  In the end, this is a descent game that is likely to be overlooked.  If tile-laying is interesting to you, this is a title worth looking to play.

A good game that has some minor flaws that keep it from being a very good game.

Pozitive:
- good rulebook
- box is the right size
- production quality of cards is unbelievable, board and box are also of very good quality
- fun if you like economical games
- easy to see what type of resources a specific building requires
- variable player powers
- short
- player interaction - both helpfull and attacky

Neutral
- player tokens are fiddly, would prefer cubes
- some of the situations that arise from gameplay are not answered in the rulebook, but answers can be found here on the forum
- insert is ok, but could be way better

Negative:
- honestly it is one of the ugliest games I've played, and this is especially true for game board and unused side of buildings
- if you are not careful players can block you without a fuss

Alkatrészek: Kibontás előtt a dobozhoz méretéhez képest elég súlyos darab, nagyon szép hangulatos dobozgrafikával. A doboz mérete egyáltalán nem illik semmilyen sorozathoz :( A fólia lebontása után és matt felületű kép tárul elénk. Ezért szedem le a fóliákat, mert ez így szép, még ha a polcon meg is kopik. A fedél leemelése után azt látom, hogy teljesen tele a doboz. Kiemelem a szabályt, táblát, majd jönnek a kinyomó kartonok - 6 db - bődületesen szép grafikával, alatta a tárolórekeszek egy csomag kártyával. Természetesen a kártyacsomag hajlott, így majd préselhető :( Egy fekete műanyag tárolódoboz van az alján, mely már előre sejteti, hogy a kinyomó kartonok üresen visszakerülnek a dobozba, mert különben káosz lesz benne. A tárolódoboz elfogadható minőségű. Az biztos, hogy a legtöbb kártyavédővel esély sincsen visszatenni a kártyákat, sem magasság sem pedig méretét figyelembe véve. A kártyák minőségét tekintve elsőre egy képeslaphoz hasonlítanám, mely rendkívül fényes felületével hívja fel a figyelmet. A grafikája nagyon szép és a tartalomra sem lehet kifogás. A szövegek jól olvasható nagybetűvel vannak ráírva. A jelek a szövegben ki vannak emelve. A tartósságáról nincs semmi tippem, mert ilyennel még nem találkoztam. Nem igazán értem miért van két "first player" jelző, de lehet, hogy ez egy új mechanika :D A kartonból készült részek jó minőségűek. Egy nejlon tasakot sem adtak hozzá és enélkül esélytelennek láttam a becsomagolást. Rá a tábla és az üres kartonok, majd a szabály és a polcon állítva is maximális biztonságban tárolható a játék.

Tile placement games aren't exactly my cup of tea, and this game is no exception. Horrendous artwork.

RATING: 7
Actually pretty fun, probably tied with Dominare as my favorite Tempest game. It really shines with two players, and I don't think I would ever play with more than three, considering the game can get really nasty and chaotic. With two players, the game is much more controlled, and takes on an almost semi-coop feel: since you both need certain resources and/or access to canals, you often end up helping each other occasionally in order to help yourselves. 

My only criticism is with the Level III/IV cards that allow you to pull from the discard pile and then get an extra play on your next turn. Toward the end of the game, since you probably don't need canals or parks any more, this becomes the default action when drawn. Often a player will draw another of the same card, which can sometimes create crushngly broken combos (we had one player twice get the card that allows you to draw another mission card, which basically meant they scored 2x what the other players did). I would house rule this to say that the card, after digging from the discard pile, gets removed from the game.

Canalis is a deep heavy euro game. Usually I am not a big fan of this kind of games, but this has a canal theme, something that (living in the Netherlands) is close to my heart. So is it good? Well, it’s not bad, but it’s one of the slowest games I have ever seen. Even people who usually don’t have AP problems sit there looking at the board for a good five minutes before they make their move. Yeah, that kills the game for me.

A perfect merger of tile laying and card drafting.

WORST RULEBOOK EVER. The game seems like it could be fun to play, but the rules explain so little of it that we've been forced to determine house rules as we play. The experience hasn't been that fun, which is a shame, as all the other Tempest games I've played have been great, including Courtier, which is by the same designer. It was notably better as a 2 player than a 4 player.

It seems under-baked. I hope that AEG decides to release a document that clarifies gameplay.

I picked up Canalis on the cheap because, despite the lower ratings, it was the kind of game that I usually like. It sounded something like a more strategic Wacky, Wacky West (or Drunter und Druber), which is an attractive notion to me. 

Canalis combines 7 Wonders-style card drafting with strategic tile-laying on a very tight grid. The cards each have two potential uses, one to a lay a tile and one to get money and/or points or to change goal cards, for the most part. As in WWW, everyone has secret goals, at least two of them. Many building tiles, when you lay them, only score after they are connected (by adjacency or by canals) to worker buildings and to the one or two resources they require. Resources can easily get blocked early, making them inaccessible the entire game. Also, two resources don't come out until the latter half of the game.

Unfortunately, Canalis is better in theory than in practice. The game basically plays fine until the last round. The ultra-limiting combination of card drafting and lack of building space at the end means that the game ends on a wimper of collecting coins and points because the placement actions cannot be completed! So right when the game should be at its strategic climax, it feels like you have no options to truly better yourself. Or, if one player, by chance, can improve themselves at the end, the action seems inordinately powerful with little strategic satisfaction for executing it.

Ignore everyone complaining about the components. They are functional if not exceptional. This game has bigger problems.

Two more plays three years later. Imbalance is the principle of this game. Rough edges abound: the same player always starting each new round, not much to be done in the last round when the board is already filled up etc. The developer seems to have taken over the game at some time and just threw in things to get it done. At least nonsensical answers by duBarry in the BGG rules forum indicate this. The rules are spotty, players have to make their own rulings from time to time. Still, there's something to this game that lets me keep it for now even though it didn't really leave the prototype stage.
---
I love Love Letter but the rest of the Tempest series left me cold so far. I also didn't enjoy the two games by duBarry I've played so far (Revolution, Kingdom of Solomon). Nonetheless, Canalis got me interested due to the spatial element of connection building and I wasn't disappointed.
Canalis mixes card drafting with laying tiles on the board and fulfilling open as well as secret goals. There are some actions allowing player targetting but nothing devastating. More important is denying other players the possibility to reach their goals by destructive placements or choosing the cards they need before they get them.
It's clearly an American eurogame with the randomizing factor of many different cards and the possibility for negative interactions. My impression is that there's enough influence to manage the randomness as well as enough depth to warrant repeated plays. Hopefully, the open goals of the roles are balanced.

Pretty nice mix between drafting and tile placement/ city building.
This might be the ugliest Tempest game? Then again, the graphic design does mean it's easy to read all the required info.
Also, characters are not balanced. For example, the grey faction (Shadowmen) is very powerful. Regardless which side you get. Whereas the black faction (Merchants/Canal Masters) is kinda powerful but needs skillful play and the right players at the table with you.

Need to get better at using early schemes though.
Also, this comment sounds kinda negative... but it's a fun game! Just with some obvious flaws :p

Odd. I don't know anything else quite like the city-building-cum-card-drafting hybrid that is Canalis, and I'm not sure I'd want to. The amount of variables at any stage in the game is almost overpowering, and there's really too many things here to think about, even in the simplest 2-player game. Perhaps it's best just to go along for the ride - it's certainly possible to earn enough during the game that the end-missions might not matter.

I have an open mind, though, and some more plays might see this rating go up.

If the end-product is what they were aiming for, this misses the mark by a long way. It's a frankenstein of Fairy Tale meets Fresh Fish with an overburden of luck and an overconvoluted scoring approach. I get some missions at the start that I want to fulfil (eg build this and that). As cards pass through your hand exactly once, you either build it when you get it or miss out on major points. But building it is just the start. Then you need to hope that no one cuts it off during the upcoming turns until you can build a canal between it and its resource, you have to get a tenement onto the board somewhere nearby in another turn (or rely on someone else), build a canal between your building and the tenement, then build another canal between your building and the harbour. All of which require that everyone else accidentally or deliberately build nothing in those spots you need to allow you to finally score it. All of which is done on a board that is far too small to fit all the available pieces! Right. How fast can you say buckley's. Every turn seems to be one where everyone is shafted by collateral damage. And you only have 16 turns in the game to attempt this whole sorry tale (and watch yourself get shafted trying) multiple times. It takes all the charm of the Fairy Tale system and covers it with a lack of control that smells more like sewerage than canals.

Fun route-building, city-building tile game involving many missions! NOT a gateway. AP warning because of tactical and strategic placement of tiles. I like this game, but this game might drive some gamers crazy. Very nice 2-player game.

I have not played 4-player yet.

Good production, but the tiles look like a well made prototype. I actually wish the board and tiles were a little larger so the graphics are easier to see. Also the faction tokens need to be bigger.

I only played one 4-player test game at Spiel13 so far.

The game components (only tiles, no wooden markers) may make the game cheaper but they decrease clarity. English texts on the small tiles make it even worse.

However the game itself offers an interesting drafting mechanism, strategy and tactics. It's a tile laying game.

I really did not care for this game. It was kind of boring. Maybe we are not cutthroat or clever enough for this game, but it panned out in a very anti-climatic way where one big canal (that I built due to my guild's mission) made it easy for everything to be connected. Without having a lot of familiarity with the game in advance it is easy to make critical mistakes, so this game is not very new player friendly. Finally, the mission cards add a lot of randomness. Someone might get one that is nigh impossible to complete, while another player practically gets free points.

RATING: 5.5
Tried 3p and immediately house-ruled away factions and secret mission cards. This game is crazy enough, with your options being determined by 7 Wonders-style draft; there's no need for the additional chaos of scoring based on stuff you probably can't even control.

I enjoyed the first half of the game, though I felt that your cards probably dictate what you're going to do, and whether you can do well. You're mostly trying to build "industrial buildings" and connect them via canals to specific resources (at the edge of the board), a harbor (two, along other edges), and something providing workers. Using other players' stuff occurs in a couple of ways: You get points when players are forced to use your workers, and you can place canal locks that bring in money from players who need to pass through them. You also want to build score-increasing gardens adjacent to your buildings, and other players can use those as well.

The second half of the game seemed broken. The board was quite crowded and most of the resources were blocked off from canals, so that the type of play described above was no longer possible.

The thing is that at the beginning of the game, when you have the option to build a building that requires the red resource (for example), it seems most natural to build the building right next to the resource it needs, and probably in front of it, in order to decrease the likelihood that the building can be blocked from reaching workers or a harbor. That makes it unlikely that that resource can be used again at all. But the second half of the game introduces industrial buildings that require [i]two[/i] specific resources, which is even less likely to be possible. It doesn't help things that the resources are along the edge of the board. The gardens are also not helpful as they clog up the board.

Another thing is that two of the resources don't start in play, and can be placed in the second half of the game. But it's tricky to play these. It makes little sense to place the resource if you haven't built the building that needs it: Someone else may build that building piggybacking off of your move. On the other hand, if you do build the building before the resource exists, another player is likely to place the resource someplace where you can't use it, just to stop you from scoring.

I think the game has a good idea and is probably fixable. But I think unfortunately that the 7 Wonders draft is way, way too random given the apparent optimal length of this game. There needs to be either more control (like auctions over everything), or a longer game enabled by more lenient connection rules. (Or another thought: Require travel by canal from a building to a resource, so that you don't want to build adjacent to it.)

...Tried this 2p. Still feels like the map is played out before the 75% mark (leaving literally nothing to do but play cards for their VP), and the buildings introduced for the second half of the game are still unscoreable. I'm feeling less optimistic that the game can be easily fixed, as you'd probably want to make a lot of changes to the deck.

Reportedly this game was improved over a couple of iterations and rejections. I'd be curious to know whether earlier versions were less prone to the board clogging up.

...This variant was promising in improving the second half of the game: When you can play a garden, it costs $1 per VP it awards. But you can also play the tile face down, as a canal (no cost or VP).

This is perhaps a little better than my rating.  I suck so terribly bad at the spacial aspects that it pulls the score down for me.  I haven't been close to winning this.  Probably not the game's fault.

Game seems easier than it is, and has brain melt potential.  It's fun, but I'm not sure how it will stand up over time.

Tile placing city builder with a card draft. Earn or use guile for special benefits. Strategically place different shaped development tiles on a shared square grid board. Place gardens and canals to connect buildings with other developments to maximize scoring. Chits are placed on played tiles to show ownership and if they have been activated for scoring. Make sure to own at least one rent-a-worker building to supply work force for other buildings. Cards are drawn from the early phase and then late phase decks.  Straight forward game that I think is a good gateway city builder game.

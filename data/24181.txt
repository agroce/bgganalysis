Rating after 1 play with 4 players. And it seems to merit more plays before that rating settles down.

I enjoyed it and I think the game is very clever, but it didn't seem that exciting.

Update:  Played again.  Still enjoyable.  But long.

Same designer as Antike and it shows because it's core mechanism is the 'Rondel' track. Antike has it's flaws, but this isn't one of them and it does keep the game moving quickly and allows different strategies to be adopted. The board looks like the diplomacy map, everything is set up for a wargame but ultimately it's an economic game and a very very good one at that.

Played four times with 3, 4 & 6 players.  Almost everyone really likes this game.  Once everyone gets the rules down the game play goes fast and everyone keeps pretty busy.  We had much more fun using the pick your own shares and not using the start up on the back of the flags.  I think keeping the investor card works very well. Use poker chips instead of the paper money that comes with the game!

151117 Held up nicely in my mind's eye, back up to a 6.

120909 Enjoyable enough in my one play, but not much interest in playing this again.  I'd play chicago express over this.  I think the added complexity of the "wargame" theme as opposed to "track laying" theme would make this a much better/deeper game for those into that sort of thing, but I was just happy playing financier and won the game by managing to avoid running any countries.

I would want to play this game again a lot more if I liked the wargame aspect (which I typically do, but not in this game).

When I first heard about that game, I was afraid of the investor-mechanic, because I dont really like it in Chicago Express. But in this game it didnt bother me at all, because you dont have the option to invest so often. Only in the end investing becomes a big part of the game and I think you really get along better without having a government position.

OK game, but fairly dry.  I like the Rondel.  There is just so much going on in this game, and it was a bit frustrating to swap control of nations back and forth.  Still, it's an interesting mix of a war game and a Euro game.  Perhaps Diplomacy meets Acquire.

Tue mich sehr schwer mit der Einschätzung des Spieles. Scheint kompliziert zu sein und dauert auch serh lange. Also die 180min die auf der Packung stehen scheinen schon ihre Berechtigung zu haben. Haben es nicht ganz fertig gespielt, deshalb erst einmal nur eine 6. Ist aber kein Kriegsspiel wie Risiko, sondern es geht hier mehr um Macht über Investitionen in den einzelnen Ländern. Also nicht nur in ein Land, sondern global. Wer da am meisten Geschick beweißt wird das wohl gewinnen, aber ich wüßte im Moment nicht wie ich strategisch vorgehen sollte. Hier muss man das Spiel wohl ein paar mal gespielt haben, was natürlich sehr zeitintensiv ist!

1 play / 5 players

LIKE: I liked the strategy involved to try to position yourself for control of a nation. I enjoy games with player-controlled tempo.
DISLIKE: For advanced gamers. Can be cutthroat when another player takes something away from you. Tough to see some information on the cards and remember some minor rules. The high competitiveness felt draining.

OVERALL: This was a tough game for me to see the rhythm on a first play. I'm not as good seeing the positional strategy in games, so it took me a while to understand some of the right-hand, left-hand player order strategies. I liked the game, but there is much to remember. Not an everyday game, but one I would like to revisit.

Muy original! Gran JUEGAZO ECONÓMICO, que parece militar pero es secundario esto. Eres un inversor, que controlas a los colores/paises, cuando tienes comprada la acción más alta de cada uno. Es original el no jugar con un color, si no controlar en esos momentos el color/es-pais/es donde tengas compradas sus acciones más altas. Como la vida real... :P  Entre 3 y 6 jugadores funciona perfecto.

I need to play this again, BUT on the positive side it's deep, interesting, rather original and has high replayability.  However, on the negative side, the game situation is constantly emphemeral and is prone to both long downtime and bouts of Analysis Paralysis.  I'm not sure that first criticism will turn out to be a bad one - I may get to grips with it after more plays, and thus find it refreshing.  But to start with, the constantly changing situation can be rather hard to get your head around - especially if you're a wargamer used to linearity.

A friend of mine commented "the thing about this game is that to win you don't need to follow what's going on on the map in the second half of the game. Just look at the investments." Spot on. The more you play, the more you see this. Weird hey! A game that looks like an Empire game and yet all those ships and armies can be next to irrelevant at the end. 

The AP could be a serious problem and needs a house rule - we have used an egg timer for choosing investment chits - you get a minute for each choice, but may invoke the "I need 5 mins clause" once per game.  When you do this, the game loses nothing but is playable in under 2 hours.

I am looking forward to playing again, so we'll see how it's score changes.  I expect it is likely to be a game that I think more highly of as I get to know it better.

RATING: 10
+ perfect match of theme and mechanics
+ elegant and ingenious scoring systems
+ simple rules, easy to learn, hard to master
+ very deep experience in a short playing time (2 hours once you know what you are doing)
+ huge replay value
+ it scales well
+ unique, very original game

I think the original [thing=24181][/thing] is slightly better than [thing=54138][/thing], because it's more tight, more tense and plays a bit faster. Also the actual historical setting helps with the theme. That being said, I also own [thing=54138][/thing]. Even though it's almost the same game with a different map, it actually feels different while you play it. So, it's good for variation.

RATING: 6
I don't know... After one play at 5p (9/2/16), it's all still pretty opaque to me. Finished dead last, a full 100+ points behind the winner (but, 42!). It's very unforgiving, and if you start badly, it's very difficult-slash-impossible to recover once things start sliding downhill. The investor card certainly took the edge off. Play seems to benefit from table talk and collusion, which was not to my advantage. With instructions, the game clocked in at about 3 1/2 hours. I'd try it again, but I'm not sure if it's a game for me, and it's definitely not something I need in my collection -- it's never going to hit the table with friends and family.

Note: Recommended to play [b][i]without[/b][/i] the investor card.

One of the great economic games, looks like a war game to some but losing a country and taking over another is entirely possible and should be aimed for if you think they can outperform the rest. Haven't played it very much recently but it deserves some more plays.

This one worked surprisingly well, I kept thinking that it could break at any minute, but the game held up to the end. Countries that see-sawed between players meant lots of combat, which kept this game from being ultra-dry which luckless combat games usually are. This game only has the rondel and combat system in common with Antike. If you liked that game, you will love this one. If you hated that game, you might still like this one.

RATING: 9
Imperial is a very darkly themed economic game. Players take the roles of pre-WWI war profiteers, buying bonds in various empires with the intention of gaining a controlling interest in them and manipulating their governments into going to war with each other so you can profit further and expand your economic empire.

It is a fairly heavy game, and I have to confess that when I first started playing, I was very overwhelmed with the choices I could make and was very frustrated with not being able to figure out how my choices fit into the game as a whole. That said, after the first hour or so, my frustration and confusion was gone and I came to appreciate how elegant and novel a game Imperial is.

It's a tougher economic game, but I'm totally sold on it and hope to play again soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very interesting economics-related game.  Lots of interesting interactions and mechanisms, particularly use of the rondel.

Primary complaint, if you could call it that, would be how a player can win by being inactive for half the game.  I wish there was a stronger correlation between a player's actions or a player being active and success.  Yes, your countries/stocks must do well, but as long as someone else is running them efficiently for you, you can just watch.  Very odd in that respect, at least to me.

I'd like to play this again sometime.  I don't think I have a very good handle on it yet, not at all.  Rating is very likely to improve with additional plays.

Only one play of this one.  For the first round or two it seemed an over-fiddly mess, but that was just group ignorance: once the rhythm of money and power point flow became clear, things improved a great deal.  This is a nice rich chewy brainburner.  Interestingly, unlike many other heavyweights I've played, it doesn't induce monastic calculative silence at all.  There's lots of interaction and table talk here.  My only complaint would be thematic.  Given the alarming degree to which investors are controlling these countries, maybe it should be set in central America during the heyday of the United Fruit Company...

Imperial is a really mediocre game when played with the investor card and/or the random nation distribution.

The randomly distributed nations are passable in three palyers since you get complimentary pairs but with more you can get stuck with Austria-Hungary and Germany and not be able to make enough money to buy into an actual earner. Just play with the real rule of buying bonds to start. You can always buy into an earner but the other players probably got a head start.

The investor card is crappy. It creates these silly timing puzzles that may not even be solvable and artificially hands nations to other players. Who cares if you've been running Britain well and want to keep buying it? The player who can't turn a profit with A-H didn't pick investor so somebody buys it out from under you. Congrats! Playing without the investor card creates much more interesting timing puzzles.

This is an intriguing exercise in investing and control. The fact that any work you do building a countries strength can suddenly be turned against you should keep you aware of everyone's position on the board. The only problem I've had is convincing some players that it isn't necessarily about attacking other countries. Investing and taxing, there's the ticket.

Played it with 4 and with 5 players, both worked well. It took a long time (45 mins to explain the rules) and about 4 hours of play.  As we played, it grew on all of us though - several of the mechanics are very good.  Also, because a turn is quick, it feels as if gameplay is quick - there are very few "long waits".

In later plays, got through rules+4-player game in 3.5 hours. Good fun.

I have played mostly on the Ipad, as it's hard to get my group to commit to a 6 player game that goes several hours.  However, this is a winner.  The action rondel is unique and interesting; the light war gaming is simple but fun.  What makes this game so interesting is the bidding/country swapping.  You own bonds, not countries, so control of the board can change quickly.  You can build up a country's position only to see some other player swoop in and buy it out from you, as they profit from your hard work.  A lot of fun and only moderately "thinky" as people learn the bond system.  Once they get that down, it starts to flow quickly

RATING: 7
Despite the subjectively low score of "7" - I am very impressed by this game. I rarely rate games I don't own, but Imperial demands this courtesy. Best of the rondel series that I've played (all but Hamburgum), though solely due to the - initially off putting due to complexity - Taxation and Investment rondel options. I won't go into detail about how these two mechanisms operate, suffice to say  they demand a type of lateral thinking and player-piece disassociation not common in board gaming. Doubt it's truly original, nothing is, but very fresh to my experience. It's so unusual it seems to take at least 2-3 games for people to truly understand (I wouldn't say I was a master by a long shot, though I did win my last game).

Ideologically I'm very anti-capitalistic in my outlooks (i.e. bushy browed socialist), but one has to adopt the mentality of a robber baron to be really successful in this game. Ironically, I kind of like that. It takes a willful desire to exploit in order to win - unlike other economic games dressed in capitalist trappings (Power Grid, Caylus, etc). My score can only go up from here (2 plays in).

RATING: 8
While the board and pieces are strongly reminiscent of Diplomacy, Imperial is definitely not a game of running a country and conquering Europe.  It is a game of investment, with the countries best viewed as companies.  As in 1830, grow too attached to running a single company and you will probably lose.  The question you must always be asking is where your money would most profitably be placed.  I find it a very engaging game whose strategic subtleties will take several games to reveal themselves.

A couple of quibbles.  Imperial feels a more constrained, less free-wheeling game than either Diplomacy or 1830.  There is no dramatic dumping of shares, in fact there's no selling at all.  There is also no positive gain for a major power from invading another major power's territory, only the prospect of damaging production by neutralising a factory. As others have mentioned, the end game, with countries mostly racing from taxation to investment and back again, is anti-climatic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Wow!  After much research for a high-level-of-interaction game with depth, Imperial has taken my friends by storm.  I've been coming home from work to find my friends waiting and ready to play.  Imperial is by far the most popular game to hit our table since Settlers of Catan.

The premise of Imperial is that players are investors (bond holders) who can invest in combinations of the six countries present on the map.  The majority bond holder in a given country holds that countries flag and controls that countries action each turn.  So the turns are all country based.  Countries need to balance military production, expansion, taxation, and payout to bond holders.  The result is a game of shifting alliances and  country control requiring good tactics and meta-level thinking -- remember you are an investor, not a country.  The goals of each are often not perfectly aligned.

One other note about imperial is that it is not as fun until people learn some strategy.  Initially some players try to take one country to a military victory, once it is clear that does not work, the next game basically turned into an invest/tax/invest/tax/... race.  That was really boring.  Fortunately it turns out that the best players use a full mix of the games options, and that has turned our sessions into a delightful frenzy.

Length: 3 hours
Players: 3 - 6 all are very fun w/ decent players
Variants: I recommend the *advanced* initial bond buying once a few games have been played.  The author has also posted 'Imperial Negotiaion' varient (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/141857)

It was a bit long due to the first game but I would certainly play this again.

I just love the elegance of this game. Simple rules and so much depth. It's very cutthroat and a player can end up losing early in the game, but it also gives you lot of fun decisions and tough timing choices. I also love the theme and how it makes you to use the nations for your own gain. I never liked Diplomacy, but this game is fun. It's actually good with two, but I can see this would be a much more interesting game with the chaos of more players. With two, it can get a bit too cutthroat and samey in the long run.

Fun factor: 4/5
Strategy vs. luck: 5/5

With an early 19th century Europe setting, players represent international financial investors. What makes Imperial different is the Nations are completely separate from the players - or put in other words, players are stockholders and CEOs of the respective countries (read: companies). Control of the countries is not permanant, for he who holds the most bonds (read: principle shareholder) gets to direct the Nation's actions through an interesting mechanism called the "Rondel".

Do not be fooled: this is utterly an economic game. Satisfies my gamer's sweet spot: sufficiently meaty while not being too unnecessary long (less than 2.5 hours). Recommended for everyone who likes games with medium-high complexity but feels a bit put off by the German boardgames' (sometimes) too abstractness to take a try.

I can appreciate the uniqueness of play in this game, but it's just not my kinda game.

We studied the rules of Imperial 2030 but we found out the copy we could play was imperial, it was an interesting game BUT in imperial 2030 you can travel across the globe while in this version we had a player in control of France and every now and then also Italy and England.. Of course he won.

Hands down, the best investment game out there.

It's really great to see new players start managing the game and its strategy as if it was a game of "Risk" or "Diplomacy", and slowly realizing that the design is that of an INVESTMENT game and not that of a COMBAT game.

When you adapt your mindset to that, and realize that the success of your starting country should not be your top priority, it all comes together and the design reaches (for you) a whole new level of elegance and admiration.

For those that enjoy heavier economic games, this is a must try.

Two mechanics in one -- a military battle in Europe circa 1914 and an economic model with buying and selling of bonds (actually, just buying).  The military component is very much like Diplomacy (minus the diplomacy).  It's a clever game -- a bit long, though, and the military component lends itself to lots of back and forth battles.

I liked this game.

The gameplay is pretty quick, there are a LOT of strategic options that you'll have to keep in mind to be successful (which I couldn't do at all, but that's not the game's fault).  Pretty solid, but seemed to go a lot longer than it should have (but that might have been the group we had to play).  Would happily play it again though!

This is NOT an empire building game.
It's rather a game of building up and milking it for what it's worth, and shifting your investments so you have a good stake into the top countries at the end.
Snatching away control of a country at critical times, shifting alliances, war, it's all there.

Edit: This might be an issue with our group, but lately most empires were in the x4 range anyway, so it didn't matter so much which shares to own. This removed, for me, a certain amount of fun from the game (trying to make an empire valuable where you have a lot of shares).

lot of ins, lot of outs, lot of what-have-yous.  a bit overwhelming at first in terms of visualizing strategy, it took a while into our first play to have the aha click onto the taxation slice of the rondel.  it's nice to play games where there's no immediate sniff of an obvious best strategy.  it doesn't seem like you can optimize your way into or out of much of anything in this game because everything is in flight, barring the absolute endgame.  i'm surprised, but after reading the praise about playing sans investor card we tried it out and universally preferred the standard rules.  repeat plays haven't been unkind, but popped it from an 8 to a 7.  makes me want to finally try the 18xx games.

This is described as a Euro-ish 'war game' , but it is really just a majority influence game with an elimination element that masquerades as 'war'.  If the machines of war were left on the board and the majority force present claimed 'control', the game would play virtually the same.  The sole reason to remove the pieces is ensure enough space is available on the board to add new pieces,  So what are the players fighting for?  Money - specifically bond debts created by the ongoing 'war'.  The player that backs the strongest income potential country(s) in the end wins.  There are some surprisingly interesting decisions with the country moves on the rondel, but this simple mechanic is not enough to carry the game.  Overall, there is potential in the box, but it has a bit of an unrefined feeling. [GTI: AGSL]

Part economic, part war game. I like the economic aspect and especially the dual role as investor and country-controller, but am less turned on by the territorial fighting aspect. All said, still a very good game. The rondel: genious.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating based on one play with 6 people, and may go up.  This is a very good game.  I see it appealing to the crowd who loves Railgames and buying stock in companies.  It's Antike   18xx on a Diplomacy map.  I enjoyed it, but not as much as its predecessor Antike, which is much more streamlined and faster.  I think that one of the minor things that bugged me about this game is that your role is that of a war profiteer, and you don't care who wins as long as you make money.  As I said, a minor nit, but just something that rubbed me the wrong way the whole evening.

RATING: 9
Whoa! This game is pure evil. I probably do not have to add any comments to the brilliant mechanics of this, but I have to say my favorite part of the game is that while it has this war-theme, the changing control of of nations give this a completely unusual feeling. 

It's tense, interesting, challenging, rewarding and fun. Non-player turns are a bit long maybe and it could really use a graphical update (wow, that cover illustration annoys me), but it's all very acceptable.

First game for all involved. One decided it was a bad game and left partway through.
One important thing to keep track of is who has control of each country, during our game we had three countries change hands within a couple of rounds.

After a second game it seems more important that you invest wisely, keep control of a country so you have the choice of doing things, but also aim to have shares in the "best" country so you earn well at the end.

had a little trouble getting through the rules the first time, but once we started playing, the pace really picked up fast.  I greatly underestimated how engaging this game would be.  The immediate decisions you make for a country you control get pretty tricky... and the longer term strategies you choose are no less tricky.  I really loved this game.  The only reason it's not higher on my wishlist is it's not that wife friendly.  The came can become somewhat agressive, so it's definiately not for the thin-skinned.  The machanics are great, the pieces are great, the general concept is still pretty new... I'm tempted to give it a 10, but I'm waiting till after my next play.  Awesome game

This game is quite unique and some of the elements show some good potential.  However the rules don't seem well thought out and unless playing with people who really understand all aspects of the game and its strategies the game tends to fall apart.  I also find that the winners keep winning while the losers keep losing.  The rule book could use a complete overhaul.  Some good house rules or a better thought out Second Edition would be something I would love to see but otherwise this is a game I will play only if everyone else in my group doesn't have any better ideas and someone has a copy.

Only one play,  but couldn't get my head around it.  I seemed to have very little control over my destiny,  and kept losing control of countries just before they activated.  Now I know you don't necessarily need control of countries to participate,  but it's about as interesting as watching paint dry.  I'm prepared to try again.  Just.

It pains me to give such a beautiful game the lowest of ratings but this game really is broken.  One player, by no fault of their own, could effectively be out of the game in the first round.  See the BGG Imperial forum for the reason this happens.

The advanced game fixes the above problem.

I enjoyed Antike, but this is better with the roundel well used.  First game I thought I was playing a war game until a third of the way through and I realised it was a stock market game.  The country that I had been possessive about at the beginning could be equally effectively developed by an opponent, and my investment still enhanced.

Further playings and the game gets better.  One of the few games I am happy to play with six.  My only quibble is that being fifth or sixth player can be a big disavantage if you have one opportunity less to invest (as this opportunity comes round so infrequently).  I note there are advanced rules that deal with this situation.  Alternativey, any player who has had fewer opportuinities to invest than the starting player should be given an extra opportunity to invest ay the end of the game.

Finally I got to play this game.  It's been sitting on my shelf for over a year just waiting for the right time to reveal itself.

After one play I don't know that I have a solid understanding of how to play the game.  I know the rules...I just don't quite know what to do with them.

What's clear is that there is a lot of potential here.  I look forward to further investigations.

This is a good game. I normally don't like games where you buy stock or shares in certain things and try to influence their end performance, but this one works for me. There is enough control to allow you to determine some kind of strategy, unlike other games (Union Pacific), and a little bit of risk-style negotiation to prevent anyone from running away with the game.
I am getting worse and worse at this game to the point where I don't want to playit anymore.

Tentative rating based on a single play. Unsure about replayability beyond 5-10 games as starting positions and turns would be similar from game to game. Definitely enough to explore though for at least half a dozen playings. Some very good timing considerations with the investor card, the rondel and the country turn order. Generally more strategic than tactical.

A legmélyebb és leghosszabb rondellás játék az eddig próbáltak közül (Navegador, Hamburgum). A mi partinkban a győztesnek az utolsó 1 órában nem volt egy országa sem, ez tanulságos volt. Élvezetes, de talán kicsit száraz játék. De ha van partner, máskor is szívesen nekiülök. Állítólag a 2030 kifinomultabb, jobban díjazza a lemaradókat, az is érdekelne. Bár szerintem már ebben is túl van kompenzálva az, akinek nincs országa, mert több kisebb befektetés nagyobb profitrátát eredményez, mint kevés nagyobb.
Ebben a kiadásban kisebbek a fa jelzők és a kartonok is, mint a 2006-os Eggertspiele editionban, így könnyebb elpakolni.

Better than Antike, but still a disappointment. A fluid board and rules that force combat. Some negotiation (or good awareness on all players part) should keep it balanced. If playing with more than three, the "advanced" setup appears necessary.

RATING: 7
Eventhough it can handle 6, there is direct conflict involved.  Not a big fan of multiplayer wargames or derivatives of.  Diplomacy/negotiations are pretty significant in this game and I don't like it.  I don't like people yelling/cajoling to win, I find it to be tiresome very quickly.

First Game: 5-12-2007
Very interesting game.  It kinda feels like 18xx because you don't own anything other than money and stocks in countries, which is just a form of money.  However, unlike in 18xx, you cannot sell your stocks.  So you find yourself in a situation that a country is just sucking and there is no way for you to cut your loses.
We played the investor card and I don't like it.  A lot of the game hinges upon on what stocks you can buy at a very critical time and the investor card really hampers your options.  I guess it works for newbie games because it takes out a layer that they don't have to consider because they don't have the investor card.  I concede that there is strategy to it because you have to time your purchases and the use of the rondel to Investor action.  I would rather have the strategic flexibility of not being castrated by the Investor Card.  One other thing, I don't think this game plays at it's best with 6.  Too much downtime and not controlling a country, while viable, is boring.  Definitely, not going to purchase for my collection since I was only looking to buy it as a deep 6 player game.  I would rather buy an 18xx to get this kind of game.  However, it is still a cool game and I am willing to try it again but without the Investor Card.  
Initial Rating: 7

RATING: 7
An enjoyable game of war even though I'm not quite sure how much depth it has, it seems that one's success depends much more on diplomacy than anything else. I like the fact that countries are very different from each other and have very different geopolitical situations from the start (much more than in Imperial 2030) although on the other hand there is a danger that this can lead to some countries being better than the others which in turn may result in more patterned play. The components are great, a lot of chunky and well-sculpted wooden elements.

RATING: 6.8
Well.
I disagree that this is his best game.
Though, this game is perfect for you if you like abstract wargames with heavy economic elements, like in 18XX. In my first play, I tried the "no flag" strategy, taking as many interest and investing frequently.
The game is a great design that mixes as perfect as possible the area control of abstract wargames and the commodity speculation of games with shares and investing.

I dislike area control, and did not enjoy this game much, in contrast with some other "more civilized" area control games that I prefer.

However I recommend it to anyone that likes the genre.

Initial Impression: Although this game resembles Diplomacy, it's nothing at all like it. The game is an economic game of share holding and stock manipulation. It's a "train game" disguised as a wargame. I enjoy the game but final few turns can be fairly boring as everyone is maximizing profits through repetitive rondel choices.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
a good game that has a difficult start, but can end very fast. Normally in a (semi-)wargame you have to play with a nation and expands and/or defends it. Here the very strange thing is that you don't play with the nation, you play the gouvernment as long as it takes. It makes a different kind of thinking. Sometimes you better loose controll and buy the most interesting share of another country.

Played this once with 2 players to learn the rules. I'm not sure what I think of this one yet. It's not a typical war game where you take one side specifically. You take on the role of a banker in Switzerland, and invest your money into nations, thereby gaining control of it's armies and resources, but other players can do the same. What might be your army one round can become your enemy's in the next. I feel like it's more of an economical control game than an area control game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played once as a 5-player game without the Investor card.  It's Acquire/Diplomacy without any dice or randomness.  Although I like the concept of not owning a country, the "beginner" game makes it hard to actually invest in countries that you really want to invest in.  If your starting country gets hammered from other players making alliances, it's hard to generate enough capital in order to invest in those higher bonds!  I was fortunate to be in an alliance the entire game... but I could have easily have been the player hammered on. 
 
This game is probably more fun without the assignment of countries!  I would play again with the advanced rules in which players choose their own Bonds instead of just getting a starting country.  

Update:  Played a 2nd time as a 6-player game with the investor card, but also as the beginner game in which the starting countries were assigned.  I disliked how the game lost focus when one of the players lost his initial country.  He was shut out of the game for 90 minutes with nothing to do.  I love the theme and the gameplay is pretty good, but the potential for someone to be shut out for more than an hour is not something that I enjoy in gaming.

This game has something worse than player elimination, which is player sidelining. In my only session with 6 players two players were basically reduced to bystanders for most of the game, not having been able to tax their countries before someone took control from them, thus falling behind in money and having difficulty regaining control. If you don't control a country you don't do anything except observe and hope you get money again. I have to say, as one of those players, it was quite boring to sit back and watch everyone else play. Better to be removed from the game! I may be induced to try it again with less players but I'm not impressed. I also do not enjoy the simplistic Diplomacy style combat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The "taxation" part of the turn is a bit unwieldy. it uses an unclear mechanism and the track on the board doesn't help to make it clearer.

First play: After the rules gradually settled in and the flow of the game became apparent, there was the wonderful realisation that this is a prince amongst games. This appears to juggle near perfect economic balance with self regulating territory control. The balance of power shifts constantly as governments change hands. 

Second play and game is won by player actively avoiding government. An 11 point spread between 3 players makes the end so close. Considering the advanced rules next.

One playing with 5 players using the default setup and the investor card.  There is a lot of interesting things going on here, and making some sense of them is quite challenging.

Definitely worth another play; having some prior experience will make the decision making significantly more calculated and less guesswork.

Played this for the first time and won. Of course it was everybody else's first time too, so not that big of a deal. Strategy so far? Make friends, never skip an opportunity to make income or invest, pump up your factories early. Don't be afraid to take controlling interest in a nation. Use it to play one country off another for your own timely purposes.Phil has this.

You need (1)factories to (2)produce more units at one time and increase the value of the country. You can also (3)import up to 3 units for $1M each. You can (4)maneuver your armies and fleets 1 space each.

Choose (5)investor when you hold the most bonds for the country and when you have the investor card so you can get $2M and buy a bond.

Choose (6)Taxation to *get tax dividend (increase from last chart position) from the bank. *Add $2M per factory & $1M per chip - $1M per unit in money to the Nation coffer. *Increase the value of shares (power points) according to the blue number amount.

Rondel choice order:
Investor
Import
Production
Maneuver
Taxation
Factory
Production
Maneuver

Very smooth mechanics.  Little down time.  My favorite element is how your choices are narrowed down so the options don't become overwhelming.

*A few years later, still a solid and smooth game.  Want to play without the "investor card" to see if it takes it to the next level, otherwise rating might settle at an '8'. Game length is also a concern, but only on whether I would ever purchase it or not.  Too long to purchase, but would readily play it.

A good game, it's seem a combat game but are an economic game, nice mechanics and the idea that you are the investor and not the chief of the nation are very nice. Take the maximum from the nation you conduct and after take another nation to squeeze money. You have to make 3 game to know well the game, but after you love this game.

Very interesting and fun game.  Don't play with the investor card - I rate the game with investor card as a 6.

Until Wabash Cannonball, this was my favorite game.

This is also a difficult game to play, particularly the first time.  Don't associate yourself with a country too much, or you will become frustrated and lose.

It has its merits, but it seems VERY easy for players to be just LEFT out of the game.  I've played it 3 times, and there always seems to be players with significant down time.  Yeah, it's fun when you're controlling 3 nations as I tend to end up doing (I've won and lost doing such)... but others might only have one... or none!  Heck, with the Interest or whatever card, a friend of mine won without ever controlling a nation so he could bid twice.  How lame is that?

I like games by Mac Gerdts and this one is a classic from him that I'd never played.  Now that I've played it once, I see the appeal.  It has his straightforward touch with what appears to be a war game but is actually a stock game.  I enjoyed my first play and would like to try it again without the investor card.

My favorite Commodity Speculation game.  This was a terriffic and fun game.  It has warefare, territory, economics and politics in the game.  Interesting mechanics that should be tried by all. We palyed the game with the investor card.  Until I play the game without the investor card I am not able to recommend the best version.  More to follow.

After two (back-to-back) plays with 4 players, I belive this game will have serious legs. It will serve very well as the game to play when there's not enough time for 18xx.  18xx players should enjoy this game, while fans of light, abstract wargames might hate it. Playing Imperial as a wargame is playing it to lose.

This is a very good game, but not in a genre I enjoy very much (economic stock game). I am having fun the first hour or so, but after that the game play is too much outside of my comfort zone to keep me happy. I prefer Chicago Express, a game that also uses stocks but can be played in an hour. I can definitely see how good this design is, and I know a number of players who would love this game, but I do not.

RATING: 8.2
An almost purely economic game - this has stocks and shares written all over it. If you can keep your nerve you can win without ever controlling a country - but it is a lot more fun to control countries and mess around with other people's plans. Looks superficially like Diplomacy but it is an entirely different game.

Enjoyable, but long, and if you dont like economic games it is not for you.

The initial game was only to 10 on the track as it was a learning game for all 4 involved. Although my provisional rating is an 8, I can see this going up as strategy reveals itself with subsequent plays.

Update 9/28/07 - Played first full game. Very enjoyable. Rating raised.

This is Antike meets Acquire. I like that the countries take turns instead of the players. If you don't control any countries, you don't make decisions for them on their turns, but you still get to do your own stuff.

It always takes me about a third or half of the game to remember that I'm not the countries I control. This is not an area control game. It's all about investing. In my second game, I controlled only England for more than half the game, and it was a piddly little empire with not much to it, but even though the taxation amount didn't go up much or at all, and England hardly ever had money to pull out for the Investor action, it ended up winning me the game, because calling taxation over and over again still bumped up its multiplier for the end. And because it was so piddly for so long, one person didn't invest in it at all, and the other person didn't get to it till late.

This game can be difficult to get your head around, but it's totally worth it. Really, really fun. Played with 4 and with 3. Works great with both.

18xx plus Antike.  The bond market antics add a lot of interest to what would be a somewhat vanilla conflict system.  Played it twice back-to-back, and would've played it again if it wasn't 1 in the morning already.

(Note: just lowered it 0.5 point for the kind of gamey Invest/Taxation cycle at the end of most games.)

First playing was fun, but took a while.  It should get quicker with further playings (hopefully under 2 hours).  Player interaction was good.


2nd playing was not as good as I was removed from playing for about half the game (my country was bought out from me on the 1st turn).  Somehow I still managed to get 2nd place.  Not too inspiring.

Both these playings were using the investor card, perhaps the no-investor-card variant would be better, but don't really have a desire to try it again.

After one play. Interesting cross between investment game and wargame. Players basically represent, I guess, multi-national business interest who invest in European nations and cash out before war crosses the border of their patron states. Players gauge the right time to invest in, steer, and cash out for maximum return on investment. The rondel system of taking actions always gives players interesting decisions to make and what actions to look out for. The game seems to be influenced as much by Acquire as by Diplomacy. A must-try for power gamers everywhere.

Secret Santa 2007. Thanks a million!
Erroneously labelled as a Diplomacy variant in some circles, this game stands by itself as a "power behind the throne" epic. Yes, there's elements of Diplomacy gameplay here, but you could say it's more like Antike for stockbrokers. 

I like how the small value bonds give a better ROI than the larger ones - whereas the larger value bonds are needed for final scoring and to ensure that you can control a country (or more than one country, ideally).

Countries are just pawns in your mission for wealth, they can be stripped bare, wasted in "pointless" wars, whatever you like, as long as you turn a profit.

If someone is battering you with a certain country, buy in to it, take control of it, now you're safe!

5 player game: Had the winning track and got Germany wrested from my control the turn before the game ended. Ended up with Investor card and would have been able to win next time it passed Investor but game ended the turn right before it. Lost by 8 million.

Up to six players invest in, and vie for control of, the six major powers of 19th century Europe. The player who makes the shrewdest investments wins this game, irrespective of how "successful" any of these powers you may have controlled over the course of the game are by game's end.

Martin Wallace used a somewhat similar concept in his "Princes of the Rennaisance," but used the auction mechanic as the primary game engine. Here, Mac Gerdts uses a "rondel" (think a round dial movement spinner without the spinner) to regulate what happens in the game as the country markers progress around the dial.

The level of investment determines which player will make decisions for the respective powers. This harks back to "1830" where control can "change hands" as players leapfrog each other in level of investment. Unlike 1830, the investments are in terms of "bonds" rather than "stock certificates," so there is no up and down action of a stock market in this game, and, while you can upgrade a holding in a country, once invested you cannot divest yourself of the base investment. Hence, the decison to invest has long term consequences for your success. Guessing wrong can hurt!

This game looks and feels much like a traditional war-game until you play enough to realize that it is much more nuanced with the economic overlay that is incorporated. The number and type of investments is the real key and while battles between nations will occur, they are secondary to the object of having the best portfolio at game end. How best to accomplish this is not obvious and will having you coming back for more!

RATING: 9
Updated rating, now I've played over 10 times. Currently I like this and want to play it again - a Diplomacy type game that I actually like. Has a feel of 18xx in that you invest in the countries, run them and try to lift money out of them to win.

Oddity is you can't get out of a country - there's no mechanic to sell your bonds, but the payout is so high for each there's no real reason not too, and if the country doesn't have the cash then the owner has to pay instead [which means you don't put your country on the 'invest' space if the country hasn't got enough cash]

Scales well - with less players it feels a little more like a wargame. Trick is to remember you're in it for the money rather than playing as a government trying to win with your country. Lots of options, but I really don't like the basic (standard) game very much - advanced setup and playing without the investor card give a much more interesting game.

Artwork is good too - board helps game play, most borders are clear and areas big enough to fit the bits. Only change I've made is playing with poker chips rather than the paper money.

** Update, shine off this a bit - some nations are just better than others with the static setup and contraints of the map. 2030 version is an improvement. Rating knocked down a peg.

Very interresting design. The fact that all nations are in play even when playing with fewer people ensures there wil be conflict soon. But if someone tries to build a huge army some other player will just buy the country. Fun!

Edit: Best with 3 or 4, more players mean someone might likely be without a controlled country for extended periods.

RATING: 7.8
Fun game with some very interesting mechanics.

It has a rondel which establishes a persistent pattern to player's phases.  

I like the economic aspect of the game where purchasing bonds gives players various levels of control of a particular nation and various levels/returns in nations.  This is a game where playing a few times will improve balance issues.  Playing you have to be agressive at jumping on the good deals on the various country bonds that youll have a chance to purchase.  Minor investments return at a 50% ratio and major are only 33% so it could take turns for your investment to come back to you which is key.

Fun game!

RATING: 7
Initial rating was 9, but after second playing had to downgrade to 7.  It is a challenging and well designed game,  but completely unrealistic.  The game can be quite chaotic when the powers change hands.  One minute your allied with France and crushing Germany, the next your seeing your shipyard destroyed by the French.  And having control over no power just sucks and is sometimes hard to reverse.  Overall, the fun aspects of military strategy are easily overshadowed by the financial aspects of the game.

Yes we did it! a six player match and it was a new feeling of how to playing a game. Two players without a government did score best, all 6 players had a maximum of one play under their belt.

Only played one game (5 players, mainly Ameritrash lovers) so far but we all liked it and everybody rated this a 7 or an 8. We still need to figure out what the best strategy is. Oh, we played the advanced version without the investor card.  Update +  Played it again with 4 players. We are still trying to figure out the best strategy, but we are getting better at just sucking the money out of the countries. We also had far less battles this time. Again we really enjoyed the game and I am sure we will play it a lot more the next few months.
Update ++ Played this game several times now and like it more and more. One guy in our group was even able to win the 2007 and 2008 WBC titel for Imperial. Unlike WBC we always play it without the investor card. Game seems to work best with 4 players.

RATING: 5
I've only got one play so I'll probably hold off reviewing it for a while; however, this game strikes me as a great resource/economic/interactive game.  The basic premise is that players are investing in one or more of 6 countries in pre-WWI Europe.  As the countries become more economically strong, they go up on the victory track (even if they weaken later).  At end game, you multiply your stake in each country by their place on the victory track.  So you get points for diversifying while making sure those countries you are the most invested in are doing better than the others.  Therefore, there are never any inherent enemies -- you can pair up with any player if you are both investing in the same country which makes for interesting alliances.  Overall, I really enjoyed this game and am looking forward to playing again.

A pesar de ser un juego de apariencia wargamera, se trata en realidad de un juego económico. Cada jugador "invierte" en diversas potencias. El que más ha invertido en una potencia, controla sus acciones. Conviene no tomar demasiado cariño a una potencia, porque lo habitual es que acabe cambiando de mano.

Tiene una forma de escoger las acciones disponibles para realizar con las potencias muy original. Un disco dividido en sectores. Es de 2 a 6 jugadores. Lo he probado a 6, y puede que se haga algo largo (algo más de tres horas de juego). Está recomendado a 4, pero aún no lo he probado con ese número.

Comprado a Moriarty en OCtubre 2011 por 29 € en estado excelente.

First play: 07 May 2008 (7.0): After a slightly rocky teaching session, performed admirably.

One of my favorite games. Has everything I like: good theme, little luck, multiple paths to victory. Scales well for 3, 4, or 5 players.

02/12/2011: Played a 6-player game for the first time. Scaled great for that group too!

12/06/14: First play in a long time but man I love this game. New strategy yesterday as I was winning with a majority in Germany and wanted to end the game quick. However, player to my left bought up the German '8' and only had 1 less share than me, but had more shares in other competing countries and would have won. So, I had to slow Germany down, earn money, invest in France and wait for that to hit the x5, even though I didn't have majority. Squeaked out a win. Awesome how the game circumstances can dictate a strategy change and if you do things right you can adjust and pull it off.

Damn, this hurts the brain. One of the most devious, underhanded and subtle games I've played in a very long time. I won my first game ... somehow. It wasn't that I was playing especially well, just that none of us really appreciated the subtleties until too late. But now that we've had a game, and my opponents know what's required, I don't expect to win any more games of this. Ever. But it will be great fun losing, because this is a very good, devious, underhanded and subtle game. It's also massively unintuitive: it looks like a wargame, but it totally isn't; and if you play it like a wargame you will lose. Badly.

There seemed to be a problem with this game that didn't seem right... it appeared to me that the optimal strategy about halfway through the game was to LOSE your own country, and spend the rest of the game just buying shares of others, which you are allowed to do if you have no country.  In fact, in a 5 player game is seemed to be a huge advantage to be doing NOTHING.  That seemed very broken to me.

Would be an 8 or 9 otherwise.

Update Nov 2010:   seems we played the rules wrong the first time AND the second time.

Update: first game of 4er. Everything started out alright but as soon as I lost control of a country it was all downhill from there. You need to maintain control of at least one country throughout the game to have a shot at winning. Otherwise, you will always be short on cash and unable to diversify investments in other countries. Very sleek game design. Who cares if the rondel is used again - it works!

I'll play it again with four, and could possibly be persuaded to with five, but never again with six.  With 5 or 6 the game is either decided by who buys last or who gets to end the game by getting to 25. It is even possible, if one were highly motivated, to look ahead and be able to figure out where the investor card will land and where the game will end once players start going tax-invest-tax-invest. I haven't played with 4 yet but would like to try.  But the game has such serious endgame issues which is not a good recipe for replayability, and I really don't like trying to fix games that have serious flaws I'd rather play something that works out of the box.  So, while the games were fun, Imperial has gone bye bye cuz I got a sweet trade offer!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Imperial is an awesome game.  In many ways, it is like Chicago Express.  It's a bit less fun (and longer) than CE, but much deeper.  While we've begun to get a feel for how to play CE well after 6 plays, with Imperial we are just beginning to sense what playing well might mean - still haven't seen it for sure, and can't imagine it will click for many more games.  The balances and tipping points share-wise are much harder to figure in Imperial, with the early game feeling very open (almost to the point of flailing around) and the endgame coming on quick and strong, so much so that you might lose out majorly if you don't time your purchases and movements well.

Another plus for Imperial is simplicity.  Like CE, this is an amazingly simple game to learn and play, but the depth built into these few rules is truly inspiring.  The rondel is a real innovation, and makes for many tough decisions and tasty possibilities.  While I rated this one as highly as CE, it probably won't make it into my top 10, just because it is significantly harder to figure.  That said, I can imagine the day where the tables are turned, and we've gotten a bit tired of CE, whereas I can't imagine Imperial not always rewarding.

Economic aspects far outweigh fighting, which is a bit too complicated for its minor relevance. Strategic planning somewhat pointless, as leadership is difficult to predict. Still, as a tactical simulation of ruthless war financing it deserves some merit.

The 18XX of wargames!  You're not so much interested in advancing whatever civilization you're in control of as much as making good investments in the countries that you think will fare well.  Sometimes it's even advantageous to control no country at all!  Many ways to go about winning.  As much of a stock game as it is a war game.

RATING: 6.5
There is a bit of everything in this game. A bit of 18xx, a bit of Diplomacy, a bit of Prince of the Renaissance, and, of course, a bit of Antike, a bit of fun and a bit of boredom. The problem is, this game is too weighty for what it is. The beginning of the game is likened to plodding through mud in the rain. The mid game is where the excitement is, but your boots are still muddy and your clothes are still wet. The end game is just a mess that you don't really care since all you want to do is get out of your wet clothes and have a hot shower.

Whilst the Rondel is generally considered to be the point of genius in Mac Gerts games (and I can see that for sure), I love how you score at the end of the game- multiplying the stock interest values by the power multiplier achieved. And the fact that power multiplier can only be pushed forward by Taxation, which simultaneously makes your country richer and more powerful, whilst draining it of resources in income for your military is terrific. Really make you think about the timing in pulling it off. I thought the game would be won and lost on the Investor action, but I find the Taxation action is where it is. Combine that with a couple of good purchases in the right countries and you could score big with just a couple of major shares and without having full board control.

Played with 6 players and it took forever. Might be better with fewer players. There was just too much time between turns and not much incentive to follow all that closely between the turns of the country I owned majority in. I couldn't influence any of it, nor could it affect me, so no real reason to pay attention.

Based on 1 play with 4 players: I really like this system so far. We didn't end up finishing our first game, so this rating is pretty nebulous. Took a couple turns to really understand how everything affects everything else... why certain actions are important, etc. My only concern is the length... though I can foresee it being quicker after everyone knows the rules. Definitely need to play a full game or two to rate it properly, but I suspect I'm going to have a hard time convincing anyone else to play.

I love playing this game. It's just tons of fun. It's long, but it plays very fast since the turns go so quickly. However, something just nags at me about the game as played with the Investor card. The timing of the card rotation (only partially in your control) can screw you somewhat and whoever gets the card last has the advantage of almost perfect information. The game ramps up so fast towards the end that the first half of the game seems a little like only semi-educated guesswork. I really want to try without the investor card. That said, I can't remember another game that I have thought about this much away from the table. 

Very much makes me want to try 18xx games.

[u]July 2008:[/u] The game is tense, very tense. Each time you buy a bond, you'll be wondering if it is the right choice. There are lots of strategies that work. You must adapt to how the game flows and it always flows differently. I've played 15 times on BSW and watched more than 60 other games and I've seen different stuff each time.
This game is a must and is largely underrated on BGG IMHO. It needs a little time to get used to the system as it really is totally counter intuitive.
The Game is great with 3 or 4 players. 5 players is ok but it gets crowded, 6 is too much for my taste and 2 player game just fails to grasp the beautiful intricacies the game provides.

Just to add, don't buy this thinking it's a confrontation game. This is a manoeuvering game. You are not fighting one country against another, here, you are tampering with countries. Get rid of the idea that one country belongs to you. The reason why I love this game is for the macchiavelean aspect. It could be a very good idea to attack one of your country with another one of your countries!
Here, your goal is not to bring your country to splendour, but to win money!!!

I just can't say how much I love this game, this is my only 10.

RATING: 4.5
Going into this game I knew I shouldn’t see it as an area control game or “wargame” like Risk; it is a much more euro-y game where you invest in various contries and allegiances and alliances shift. However, after having played it once, I am baffled. In every single game I always have an idea about a strategy or what can pay off or something like that. And I usually understand why I lost a game and can improve upon in my next game. But in this game – not at all! I was and still am absolutely clueless as to what went wrong (I ended up last, which is quite unusual for me, although it was a fairly close race). So I won’t say too much about what I liked and disliked about the game. I will wait for my second play, either of Imperial or Imperial 2030, before writing further comments. But I doubt that I will try it soon – the game didn’t grab me at all as it felt quite “clinical” and perhaps too much focused on stocks and the economic aspects. That’s too bad as my expectations were high due to the fact that I like Navegador and that Imperial is in top 100 here on BGG.

Nice twist on other empire type games in which you only control a country whilst you are the biggest shareholder. It's all too easy to start thinking that you are a country's general or kaiser during your first few games. Better to think of your role as an international banker or arms dealer where money is what's important. More than a passing resemblance to Diplomacy but much more fun unless you end up not controlling any country for a long while. It is a clever game but not one I am any good at. I always make some tactical error and fail to time my last turn correctly. Six games to date.

Game with a counterintuitive feel -- it looks like a wargame, but it's at least as much an investment game.  Yet it's possible to overemphasize the investment element, as I tend to do.

I'm not a big fan of stock games because I always struggle to track what money is mine versus what money belongs to a country and how that money moves with all the different actions. Imperial is no different, it's a heavy stock game that is very thinky and lots of moving pieces that to me is all work and no fun. 

In fact Imperium might have too much to remember, we bumped the table once and no one knew exactly where a piece went. That's a sign there's too much going on for people to realistically keep track of. This is made worse by the fact that the country you control changes throughout the game so if you take on a new country you will likely have AP figuring out your new position on the board. I'll likely pass on playing this again unless everyone else really wants to as there is nothing in here that makes me want to come back to it.

Update: This game is great fun. It is difficult to work out, you need to fly by the seat of your pants, but it is tense and exciting. 

First game. It was very difficult to see what was going on. I tried to have a diverse portfolio and purposefully let players take control of my countries so that I could take the bonus of being able to invest because you have no country. It worked OK but not great. I think money ended up being wasted on bonds in countries that ended up with a 0x or 1x multiplier. I think you need to invest thoroughly in the countries that are doing the best. Having control also helps because you can ensure the countries are taxing and paying out interest rather than waging pointless wars of attrition.

(7-9-10 after 5th game) This is truly a gem. The timing challenges are really so delicate and enjoyable. The early game jockeying for cash and control... The late game timing of the rush... Finding a way to own shares of the 5-value by hook or by crook. Even six players, if all experienced (and okay without control) is really a great experience. From 8 to 9.

Update after 2nd game: What a facinating game! This may well be the perfect game for me: an auctionless shareholding wargame with negotiation. A second play with four (vs. six) and the right rules (mostly) made a huge difference. I imagine the game is still good with six, but probably for experienced players only. I feel like we're still just scratching the surface right now. Can't wait to play more.

First game was interesting, but not the eyepopper I expected. May be the fact that we played with six. I get the feeling four, maybe five, is the sweetspot. Looking forward to playing again.

first impression.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Modestly prone to groupthink even with good players (even more so with inexperienced players).  Faintly reminiscent of the 1829 branch of 18XX crossed with Acquire. Surprisingly emergently complex for such a simple system.  Don't bother with the beginner setup with pre-allocated shares.  Also don't bother with the investor card.  Go straight to the advanced variant without the investor card.  It is far more interesting.  Also, bin the paper money and use poker chips for faster and easier play.  

Note the rhythmic power of countries on opposite sides of the board from each other.  There are interesting phase systems that can be worked with such country pairs.

When played without the investor card this rates an easy 8.5 for me.  When played with the investor card it falls to a dismal 3.  It simply isn't worth playing with the investor card.

The game without the investor card is notably phase-driven and moderately money starved.  The reduced economy makes the exact timing of bond purchases far more important to specific country fortunes and to final player net worth than when playing with the investor card (each bond purchase forms a larger percentage of the   player's final holdings as less bonds are bought). 

The game is far improved by playing with a group dedicated to Imperial.  There's an easy whole point rating available for that special circumstance.  Sadly that's not locally available, not in the manner I prefer, so Imperial is shelved out of rotation and sits at 8.5.

On the one hand, I'm very taken with this game from the outset.  There are so many interesting interactions and tactics that it makes me want to play more.  I'm also liking that it has a few similarities to 1830, since I do want to try that with my game group.  On the other hand, the sheer brutality of the game makes me hesitate in rating it higher.  It just seems like without careful play it's possible to just sit back and watch things happen, which is rather boring.  I'm sure that playing with the same group, similarly to 1830, would improve the matter, as a novice will surely be preyed upon by the veteran.  But I did have fun, and I would like to play more.  I'm very impressed with Eggert-Spiele at the moment.

RATING: 7
UPDATE 12/8/17: Finally after many moons got in (part of) a game without the investor card and with the advanced startup rules. Advanced start I would recommend for anyone who's played more than a couple of times, though drawing lots for starting bonds still seems like a strong choice as an introduction.

Playing without the investor card [i]does[/i] improve the game, though it does apply a slight brake to the snappy pace of the game that is part of what makes this so good, and I cordially disagree with people who regard the game with the investor card as trash.

:sugar: :( :what: :what: :D :) :) The anti-war war game, basically [i]War Is A Racket[/i] rendered in chipboard and hardwood. Players of Imperial are financiers who buy bonds in the six great powers of Europe pre-WW1. (Sorry, Turkey.) You can buy stock (bonds, technically) in any or all of the countries, and their value at the end of the game is a direct result of both their success at military and/or industrial expansion and the frequency with which they tax those assets. A la 18xx/Chicago Express, countries have their own treasuries with a strict distinction between them and their controller's personal treasuries. Also like those games, national (corporate) treasuries are dead money in terms of win conditions, so one partial path to victory is contriving ways to slough those treasuries back into your personal pocket.

Also like 18xx, the game is totally deterministic, with no elements of chance save the initial draw of bonds (in the standard rules) or the person who starts the auction (in the advanced rules).

The rondel mechanism is the clever bit, because it forces a tough choice on each country's controller (the player with the highest total bond holdings in that country): go slowly around the rondel and you are better positioned to build factories and/or build military and maneuver them into neutral spaces that improve your tax position, but this same slow roll around the rondel means you less frequently hit the taxation (pumps money into national treasury and gives the country the power points that make their bonds more valuable at game's end) and investor (disburses national treasury money to those greedhead bondholders and enables new bond purchases) spaces.

First-timers frequently get tripped up by assuming that a board that looks like Diplomacy implies a game that plays like Diplomacy, get over-attached to their one country, and end up overvaluing conquering the map. But it gets trickier, because it's easy to swing to the opposite extreme and overrate portfolio-diversification vs. picking a winner and making them win.

One recommendation, especially for learning games: at game's end, instead of calculating final scores on paper, buy back bonds for money equal to bond value in points x the credit rating, most money wins. It's totally equivalent but it hammers home the point that money is also points and the purchase of an expensive bond in a low-performing country (say, one at Credit x 1) is actually less good in the final analysis than just keeping the money -- those 8 and 9 level bonds are only worth the effort after a few spins between Investor and Taxation on the rondel.

If the mark of a good game is the ability to play many times and not feel like you've come close to really learning its tricks, Imperial is quite a good game indeed.

Outstanding! Imperial is an easy game with many big huge levers all the players can pull, causing very satisfying effects throughout the game's interconnected machinery.

Maybe this is because I'm not a believer in Balance of Power theory, but I liked this much better than Diplomacy.

I'll give it points for not having any random elements (aside from any completely arbitrary decisions that happen to be made on the part of the players). The decisions are interesting enough. However, the game didn't "grab" me - meaning I don't feel any desire to play this again (though it's not a bad game). Perhaps it's just that, for what the game offers, it takes a bit too long.

Imperial is good as long as there is some table talking. The diceless combat system at first turned me off until I realized that I could negotiate my way out of combat and that indeed sometimes combat is a boon as you can create "retirement legions" that get "disbanded" right before tax time.

The investor card leads to an interesting metagame as you try to figure out just what country you want to go for and how safe an investment that country is.

After one play, I don't feel qualified to give an in depth review, but I wanted to record my first impressions. The game is well designed. The mechanics were unique to me and interesting. I had difficulty identifying strong stategic goals, but I also didn't have a clear grasp on the interactions between the rules. I didn't even realize that the leader of a country got bonus pay during a good tax season. Clearly, there is a benefit to controlling a country, expanding, and taxing. The bonus pay for being the leader of a country whose taxes increase seems important. Also, owning a controlling interest in the lead country is important. But it is difficult to buy bonds in the lead country without exposing yourself and losing control of the countries you currently control. It sucks waiting through a turn when you don't control a country.

I'd definitely play again, but I was not enamored my first time through like I was with Agricola.

RATING: 8
It feels a bit like 18XX except that once you own stock (bonds) in a country you can never get rid of them. The "ownership" or control of the government, rather, does change hands some...but if you gut a country you'll likely still be the owner. 

There is a great balance of tensions on a few different levels. For example, simply the balance between having a country perform well and benefiting you personally by paying out. 

I feel like I need to put more thought into how to play well...its certainly not intuitive, nor is it static. You can't enter a game with a set strategy without adapting to the events of the game, or you'll lose. The learning curve is for strategy only, as the rules are quite straightforward. 

In my first game game, immediately after playing one player ordered the game and another made a trade to obtain a copy. And all 4 of us wanted to play again right away. I look forward to getting more satisfaction from this one.

I'd rank this one a bit higher than Antike, if I could only choose one.

After one play I am REALLY looking forward to playing more. My only complaints about the game will hopefully be solved by removing the investor card. I really enjoy the theme and the feeling of controlling countries without really caring about their wellbeing.

RATING: 6
Imperial is the stock market based version of the Eggertspiele Rondel system which is also present in Antike and Hamburgum.

Here there are 6 countries vying for control of Europe. The catch? They each have a portfolio of stocks available, and one player can control several countries, one country, or no countries. The goal is to make money, and the way to do that is to simply invest in the countries which are making the soundest financial decisions. There is a combat engine present, which can be either very important, or very un-important given the mindset of your group. Suffice to say that having a potential defence is always good, but avoiding combat, in general, is a good thing, because of opportunity costs.

The system here is fairly opaque, which I find appealing. Players have to juggle several balls at once to make a profit. Money goes into country coffers, which then muster armies and take over territory so they can earn more money, which can then be moved back out into player hands.

Control of the right stocks at the right time is crucial. Which means that I must bring up the Investor card / no Investor card thing. I have played the game using each variant, and I think it works with either. The downside to the no Investor card is the lack of money. The downside to the card is the potential advantage to the early turn players, as they will likely have more opportunities to invest (assuming the late turn players don't catch up by spending some time flag-less just for that purpose). I think I would like to play with the combined rules, where the Investor card is circulating, but only hands out money, while players are still allowed to invest in each country after it takes its turn ala the no card rules.

The main downside with this game is that I feel it takes a bit long for what it is. In the same time frame I could easily play a Prairie Rails game. In a longer time frame, I could pull out an 18XX game. I would enjoy either of those options more, because they strip away the war game veneer and just let players go at it in the pure economic arena, which is really where this game's action and heart is at anyway. This is the kind of game that I pulled out as many times as I did simply because I really like the premise, but the game just isn't quite there for me. The flow of the game is simply too slow in terms of power point build-up, and every time I play it it seems to wear out its welcome beyond the second hour. In theory, stock games can work without sales but I think they need to be something very special, and I definitely think Imperial would have benefited from some sort of market, as a side benefit it would have made the theme fit the game more appropriately.

All of this said, I think this is an interesting system, and I still wouldn't mind playing it every so often because it does do a few cool things, but I still feel like this game system would be much better if it had been refined in some way to make it less of an utter slog to build up power points.

What a broken game. Got outbid on the first turn. Was on the wrong side of the start player so lost any investor options. 30 minutes later got to invest. Got control of France. Somebody else took control 5 minutes later. Game time 3 hours. My active contribution 15 minutes. Somehow I didn't come last - totally ridiculous.
Participation so limited I read the rules to another game for 2 hours and it had no impact on the other players. Pointless game!

One of the best euro-games! A tense game without luck, deeper than Antike but using the same [u]rondel[/u] mechanic. It has a step mastering curve and a high replayability. It has a Stock Holding mechanism similar with various 18XX train games and a warlike aspect. The idea is to investing in the right countries and to manipulate events in your favor. It shines in 4 player games.
We prefer to play without the Swiss Bank rule. Instead, each time the Investor collects $2M, the player with no controlled nations may invest in one nation or collect $1M.

Takes the 18xx idea and adapts it to a movement & combat game.  The stock market segment is MUCH less sassy than the train games, though.  But still, it's all about the stock manipulation.  The difference is it feels MUCH more passive to me when compared to 18xx.  But still well worth a play.

2 plays so far. I like it. I love the "Acquire" aspect to it. Like Antike, turns are usually blazingly fast. I am a bit concerned about the ability to come back if the countries you've invested in tank. I want to try "my" no-investor card variant. Bits are great (borderline too big).

The [i]game[/i] is much more robust without the investor card, but creates (necessitates, really) that players expend great energy analyzing purchase decisions. If left unchecked a player without a country is in a very powerful position.

RATING: 4
My first experience with Imperial was... how to say this... not good. First of all, the explanation was horrendous, leaving me none the wiser what I was supposed to be doing and how to go about getting it done. This will kill any game, so is not really Imperial's fault. But the game had me thinking of Diplomacy with stock markets with Antike's rondel mechanic (which is clever, but which I'm not overly fond of), and I made the decision to leave my stock up for grabs after about 20 minutes. I really have to try again when I know a bit more what I'm supposed to be doing—perhaps then it will be better.

[b]UPDATE[/b] And so the second opportunity came to pass. I understood what the game was about much better, although there is a wide gulf between such understanding and playing well enough to win, of course. As with all games involving stocks or bonds (in Imperial it's bonds) you want others to finance your expansion elsewhere. Those others can be the other players or the bank. Other players invest in a country, and that money will flow into your pockets through dividends; the bank generates taxes which also end up in your pockets as dividend, and you get a small bonus paid by the bank when a country's wealth goes up. Even if you don't take control of a country, it pays off to have bonds all over the place simply because it increases your liquid assets and thus purchasing power. If for whatever reason you cannot get this feedback loop up and running well enough, you lose the game. Plain and simple.

Imperial's stock manipulation mechanisms are polished and allow plenty of exploration, so no problems there. But it's the execution which sours me on this title. One issue I have with this game is that blasted rondel again. If you extend yourself using as little military force as possible (or extend yourself by burning off the soldiers), you want to first tax the country (so the obligations go up in value), and then immediately play investor (so you get dividend you can use to invest elsewhere). But in between those two steps are five other countries, and by the time you can take the second action, someone else may have grabbed the investor card—and doing that action without you holding the card is not such a good idea. The rondel breaks up a core mechanic of the game into uneven steps which [i]might[/i] make for an interesting journey, but I'm not one for such finesses. The second issue is the awful 1:1-combat rule. As with Antike this heavily favours the defender. It takes time and effort to build up a force capable of reigning in others, and every time you take another step to work on this aspect, someone else might be going for the quick cash with which he can simply out-finance you. Or the military situation simply changes for the worse. So the game tends to devolve into trench warfare with stagnant nations: powerful ones stayed powerful, weak ones stayed weak. A player controlling bonds in a strong nation has no real incentive to weaken that country's position, at least not for a while. (He might in order to ruin a country and then jumping into another country with the 'bail out money', so to speak. If the players controlling bonds in that nation don't see this coming, they have a major problem. However, such a manoeuver is tricky and won't occur regularly.) A player controlling bonds in a weak nation has no clout to hit the others with. This gives Imperial a rather tacky feel. The final issue is a corollary of the above: players should prevent such a situation at all cost, but since it is a deterministic design, player chaos reigns supreme. Wheeee...

As I said, the stock manipulation is challenging, I'll give Imperial that. The marriage to the rondel more or less sinks the game for me. Without the rondel and a more fluid attack model the game would be right up my alley. Basically, control in this game is very fleeting. All you can do is create incentive, and hope that others do a bit of a legwork too. I tend not to like such games very much: I am the one playing, so I want to do something, not hide in the coulisses all the time. I might play it again in the future, but I'm not holding my breath, to be honest.

I might actually pull this down a tick, purely because of length of time.  In this game the length is perfect.  But if the game goes like our game today, the end drags as people don't want to end the game.

Nov 2007.

Played twice.  Feels like Acquire the war game.  Don't know the best strategy of this one yet.  War is definately not the key to victory.

Game seems fun but am not very competitive in it yet.  Initial rating is an 8 because I wouldn't turn down a game and I'm still trying to get people to play this with me.

For some reason, it is very hard to get part of my group to play this.  May have to run this at a convention.

An interesting hybrid of stock and war game which makes this game right up my alley.  Kind of like a train game Diplomacy.  I've only played it a couple of times as it can go fairly long but look forward to more.  The bits are great and this game has a serious heft factor (lot of wood here!).

I'm not sure about the Investor space/card angle as the when/hows of buying stock is huge.  We used the Investor card and it worked okay, but I'd like to try a variant or two.

I like the general concept and mechanics of the game BUT be warned that if you lose control of your countries then you will NOT get a turn, only sporadic chances to purchase bonds. This happened to me in my first game and it meant I sat for about 1 hour (from mid-game to the end) with almost nothing to do. This was no fun and because I don't want to be in that situation a second time, I can't see myself ever playing this again.

RATING: 3
A stock market game in which the purchase price of the shares is unrelated to their value, and you only get the option to purchase shares at specific times, so may be locked out of the game for considerable periods. The market is based on the movement of the values of countries, which can only go up, but at variable rates - huge leaps in country value in the endgame and the inability to sell stock, make rational investing very difficult. The meta-wargame that moves country values up and down is quite amusing but very simplistic and again, since only lead share-holders run countries, you may be locked out of playing a country for considerable periods but still win. Dreary, irrational, long.
Nov 2012.  I tried Imperial 2030. The board is more interesting than the original, but all of the weaknesses noted above remain. Interestingly, I played with experienced players and the winner was a complete surprise to everyone, until points were counted.

This used to be a ten.  It has an amazing blend of mechanics - wargame, stock game, rondel.

Very good mid-complexity group game which is sweet with 4 or 5.  The buying and selling dynamics are very cool and it is a lot of fun trying to game the position on the board so that the countries whose bonds you hold are not working against one another.  The first game is often tricky for some people as it really does take a shift in thinking not to think you are playing as a country.

Imperial is a very very strange beast. Instead of controlling 1 specific country, you are an evil war profiteer, investing in the great powers of WW1. As a new player, it's very difficult to understand what's a good move, as comtrol of these countries shifts about.

You really only take actions when you have control of a country, meaning there can be long periods of time where you don't do anything. When I play a game I expect for it to be 2 things: fun & engaging. This game fundamentally fails to be engaging, as you can sometimes get up and leave for 20 minutes and would not have missed any of your actions actions. Couple that with a fairly long length (3 hrs) and you get disinterested players napping on the couch.

Is there anything good about the game? Yes. The theme is fantastic, and by far the best part. Acting as an evil top hat & monacle wearing war profiteer is hilarious. Pulling the strings behind the countries is a fun idea.

Imperial is a great idea hampered by boring gameplay.

First play: Favorably impressed. Of the three Euro-AT hybrids I have played in the last year, this is by far my most positive experience (my other two plays? Tempus and Shogun). Takes a bit of getting used to the idea that you are primarily playing the role of an investor, rather than a political/military leader. First play with five people, none of whom had ever played the game, took 4 hours. We played with NO investor card and ADVANCED rules, and I anticipate that our group will opt to play this way always. All players recognized early on that this is NOT Risk, and that the goal was NOT to conquer the board. After one play, there are naturally a lot of tactical optimizations and strategies to be worked out yet, which is a good thing - the game is interesting enough to think about after a play, leaving the players looking forward to their next play. Components are of high quality, if not spectacular, and the rules are fairly clean - we had no questions which we could not answer by searching the rule booklet for a minute or two.

As the nations of Europe battle it out in a very simple wargame, players "invest in bonds" in the different countries to both control the action and hopefully end up backing the right horses.  The combination of a simple wargame and a simple stock market (well, sorta) game makes for a real brain-burner and real fun.  Takes a play or two to really wrap your head around it, but it's worth the effort.  The only negative is a potential downtime issue when a player doesn't control a majority in any country (which allows you to make its moves on the map) and doesn't get a chance to invest for a while.

An interesting blend of Diplomacy (land and naval units, diceless combat) and 18xx games (shares, payments, payouts). Except you've got factories that tie into your economy, the whole Rondel mechanism, and you're usually not playing any one particular nation for long.

I continue to enjoy this each time I play it. I haven't played the Basic Game vs the Advanced Game enough to decide which I prefer yet, however.

On a side note, the rulebook for this version is quite terrible. Note the 3-page FAQ for a game that really shouldn't be that difficult. Thankfully, the FAQ is quite helpful. The rulebook for Imperial 2030 is much better.

Very interesting but has a learning curve.  Things bogged down in warfare and went long.  We realized late that Invest and Taxation were the two most important parts of the dial.  Rondel looks symmetric but isn't.  I think a country should make the expansion push right before Taxation.  Excited to try this again.  UPDATE.  Been thinking about playing without the investor card.  Can't figure it out.  Rulebook is a joke!  UPGRADE.  Even though I now have serious issues with the investor card (won't use again), Imperial is feakin awesome with lots of conflict and interesting things to think about.  Remarkable game.  UPDATE: With investor card, keep track of first investor and at game end cycle the investor card through all remaining players.

I played 1 game with the pre-set set-up where France was taken from me before I had bought any stock, and I was not able to gain control of ANY country until 45 minutes later.

Ever since BGG personally recommended this to me as the #1 non-owned game that I should be playing, I've been itching to get into a game of it.  After one play, all I can say is that even though I didn't really know all that was going on, I'm pretty sure I enjoyed myself :)

RATING: 8
This is really great if you think of it as Acquire with corporate raiders instead of cannons.  But the actual warfare element kinda weighs it down.  If everybody plays aggressively, every country will be broke, and the game will never end.  If Taxation was in some way automatic so the game had to proceed to an ending, it would be a 9.

Oh wait, 8 instead of 7.  If there were only 4 players, then 2 would have two countries and 2 could team up.  Then what you are working for is securing an alliance that allows you to concentrate on expanding and keep a peaceful front.  Then you might not be stuck in an infinite attrition battle.  I can dig it.  Need to play this a bunch more with fewer players.

Must be played without the investor card.  The investor card puts too much luck in the table order (some people will have more chances to buy stock in the game) and gives WAY too much power to a person with no countries.  He can buy a 1 or 2 stock every turn, which is much more efficient for getting VPs.

After 1 6er game, I found this to be somewhat boring and long.  I'd take it or leave it..thus a 5 for now.  The rondel had potential but because the game is so scripted, there were 2 groups of 3 countries that did the exact same move (on the rondel) for 2 or 3 turns!  It's also a long wait between when you make decisions.  The little tile that allows you to buy stock takes *forever* to get back around to you.  In the interim, you feel like you are just twiddling your thumbs even when you move your military.  Sure you can expand your empire a bit and fight...but that doesn't really get you anywhere.  I think that's where it falls flat for me.  The fighting was somewhat pointless once you get a few neutrals....most of the game your military just occupies the same spaces.  And you wait around for the opportunity to buy more stock. Also, the endgame is very static, Invest-Tax-Invest-Tax-Invest...etc.  Rating could go up with more plays, but I'm skeptical.  I prefer Union Pacific and Acquire over this one.  They are very similar.  Still, I'd be willing to give it another shot.  We played with the introductory setup...I'd like to see how the normal setup would changes thing around.

2nd play...The normal setup was better.  I'm bumping this game up from a 5 to a 6.  If it weren't such a long wait between turns, I'd bump this up to a 7.

3rd play...The game is much better with fewer players.  I think 4 may be the sweet spot.  With fewer players it is less likely a player is in a dreadful position of not running a country and being cash poor.

Players represent the power behind the politics during the 19th century.  Players "invest" in countries, purchasing bonds which generates cash flow for those countries.  The largest investor in each country gets to play the turn for that country, allowing them to tax, pay off bonds, build up armies and fleets, move those armies/fleets, etc.  The object of the game is to make the most money, and most of it is made by your bonds which escalate in value based on how well the country did in terms of conquest.  Lots of good stuff here, reminiscent of Antike (the Rondel is back, so everything is quick and pacy).  Very good game.

Didn't enjoy this is as much as I thought I would. It's manifestly a great game by one of my favourite designers. I think though I do not know that this is in 18xx territory, however I found the way that the money was organised - the countries money vs your money a bit bitty and it bothered me, especially after playing navegador, concordia and other elegant games from the same designer. Perhaps I am just saying that this wasn't for me. I'd play it again, though I don't think I would hunt it out.

RATING: 6
Despite my fellow gamers telling me I wouldn't like it, I enjoyed the game. After you wrap your head around the concepts involved, the game becomes very interesting. It seems a game worth exploring with others who play often - which is why I likely won't find occasion to play it. It's a very good economic/diplomatic/war-type hybrid. The rondel is less than exciting, but adds needed structure to your decisions. The design justifies its duration - which I rarely find to be true for anything 120 mins. + --- lowered rating after playing 2030. The new version is just that much better.

An odd-feeling game, that I couldn't quite wrap my mind around at first play. Only one person at the table had played before, which I think skewed play. I won by $1. Need more plays.

UPDATE: Now I've played with three and the winner (myself) was again the player that owned the fewest countries. Therefore, I sat and watched the game unfold as a spectator throughout most of it but made smart investments. Even though I won, the game was boring.

Only one play and I thought the game looked very good. However, we unfortunately played with 6 and the game was way too chaotic and long with 6. The winner (and second place also) got his points by not owning any countries most of the game and just investing. A good strategy perhaps, but not very fun for 3 hours. I saw enough in the game to bring me back again, but I don't think I could ever be talked into playing with 6 again.

Imperial looks at first glance like a dudes-on-a-map territorial control game, but that's deceptive.  It's really a stock market, economic, investment style game.  And that's not really my type of game.  
I will say, though, that this one is much more approachable than others (*cough* 18XX *cough*), since you can see the country's power growing on the board as it gobbles up more territory, and see its progression along the stock value/power track.  It won't be obvious at first, since they're all evenly matched, but one will start to pull ahead, and you'll have to decide whether to jump on the bandwagon and invest in it, or try and use its neighbors to reel it in a bit.  The rondel mechanic also works here, as there's kind of a cycle to what you're trying to do.  Expand, use the new territory to make money, invest some of that cash in future growth, use that growth to make more troops, and expand again.  Somewhere in there is the most important action, investing, where the company pays out funds from its treasury to the shareholders (so you get your cut of the proceeds).  
So, for a boring economic game, it's not bad.  Hard to teach to new players though (always someone who wants to play it like risk), and can take quite a while.

My second game that involves stock/shares holding. Although I'm familiar with the rondel mechanic, knowing nothing about how stock/shares work caused me to work twice to understand. It puzzled me in the very beginning on how to figure out how it works but in the end, I think I've learned some. It's quite interesting to see how war is implemented in a stock holding game. Excellent design from Mac Gerdts himself.

Acquire plus diplomacy, but perhaps a little less cut throat than both.

It does deal very well with the political issues of multiplayer war games though.

Nagyon jó játék. A szokásos rondellás alapú, de mégis más: nem vagy senkivel, hanem irányítasz nemzeteket, hol ezt, hol azt, ahol épp sikerül fölényt szerezni, és mások nem túrnak ki. Az adott nemzet és ate érdeked nem mindig ugyanaz, hisz néha jobban jársz ha kizsákmányolod őket, mint fejleszted. Csak fejlesztés hátránya, h akár ki is szoríthatnak a nemzet vezetéséből. Ugyanakkor ha egy nemzete sem vezetsz, sem akkora baj, de akkor nem árt ha van vmi tőkéd: de a játszott játékban, kevés tökével, nemzet nélkül is 3. hely, alig 1 ponttal maradt le tőlem, aki második lett.

I loved my first game of Imperial. Looking forward to playing this game again.

The more I play, the more I enjoy this game. It's becoming one of my current favorite games.

My first few games played were close second or wins. Tried Imperial at the 2008 WBC and went to the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, I was last but scoring was close.

This game just clicks with me, even though I played very few games, while some others, I played alot and still trying to understand what I am doing.

Imperial is a game which I would play every year at the WBC. Just wish I would play it more here to have some pratice.

This game presents a wonderfully fresh perspective on the global/political domination genre.  At first glance it would appear to be a basic territorial conquest game, but in reality, it's all about monetary investments and profit.  The military forces in the game are just tools to be used to increase wealth and power.  What makes it especially interesting is that control of nations can change during the course of the game and multiple players can simultaneously have a stake in the same nation's fate.  Imperial is a beautifuly executed game design that keeps players involved throughout.

Advanced setup and the variant with no Investor card are definitely the best way to play.

Interesting business game themed as a World War I era war-ish game. Unfortunately, it has a fatal flaw of a player losing control of their country and not being able to invest enough to gain a country back. They get to sit there and watch the game.

Better than Antike but not much better. There's more interaction now, but there's no strategy behind it. You can buy shares but no way to sell, and yet there's no strategy available to deal with a bad investment. Stock acquisition game with none of the strengths of such a game, like Acquire. And far too long for a game that has no long-term planning.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
There are several major problems with this game:

1. The normal method of buying shares is dreadful.

2. Once a player or/and a country is doing well there is a snowball effect where the struggling players just fall further and further behind.

3. Your fate is determined far more by what everyone does than you do, which doesn't work in such a "heavy" game.

4. At the end of the game, even if you get trounced, you can't see anywhere where you went drastically wrong or what you could have done to improve.

Ouf! This one is a brain crusher. A very long game with complex strategy options. However, both times I played it, the game was very engrossing and it is certainly not boring! It's even a good game with only two players, thanks to the multi-country mechanic.

RATING: 4
[2 plays] This isn't a bad game, it's just not my cup of tea.  Stock market plus war = I'm bored just thinking about it.  So I was pleasantly surprised after the first play when it wasn't that dreadful.  But the second time sort of clarified what else I don't like about it.  The game ends sooner than you might think it will the first time; it ends when any country gets to the end of the power track, and once they've become decently powerful, they can leap way ahead down this track in a single turn.  Once people realize that the game will end soon, it sort of enters this tedious endgame phase where nothing you can do is much use, and everyone is intensely calculating the possible outcomes.  

Anything you actually do on the ground takes time.  Producing units is one turn, and sending them anywhere requires another turn.  And outside one's own nation they can only move one space at a time, so it could take a good while just for your fleet or army to get to where the action is. Basically everything takes time to come to fruition.  Once there isn't that much time left, then actually DOING anything becomes pointless, and all that's left is financial maneuvering. 

And that amounts to a bunch of chess-like thinking (If I do this, then they might do that, and then I would want to do this, etc.), but where every possibility is also a cumbersome mathematical calculation.  It kind of felt like at a certain point we stopped playing the actual game and then spent 30 minutes figuring out who won.  Ho hum.

After one game with three and the investor card, it's gone in my pantheon of games that I stand in the shower thinking about the day after I played for the first time.  I expect that the rating may improve with more plays, as the deep analysts on BGG have given me confidence that the replayability is there.  Unlike with Antike, I like the deterministic combat here (and the application of the rondel is also better), since the fluidity of nation control means that battle is merely a sideshow to the skullduggery underneath and so there's no reason to draw it out.

A pretty remarkable and elegant design - to make something so easy to learn, without cubes, cards, or counters.  It has a thematic feel, appears to scale well between 3 and 5, and provided a deep experience in just enough time to fit into a weeknight session.  What more can you want?  I guess my one concern is the anticlimactic end game.

After playing Imperial and Imperial 2030 both with and without the Investor card, I'm not sure I enjoy stock manipulation games. Imperial is a stock manipulation game with the veneer of Diplomacy on top, however, that's a total red herring. From what others tell me, Imperial is great at what it does, but after several plays (all 6P), I still never find myself enthused to play it. Interestingly, my friends are split as to the Investor card (I prefer without it).

Rather brain melty on the first time around. I like the interconnectedness of the actions, but I am concerned that chance of where the investment card is, combined with the number of other people manipulating countries that you  have interest (stock) in but no real control over, takes away some sense of actually being able to shape the game in your favor. In other words, it is brain melty because it gives the illusion of control, but it is, at least to some extent, just an illusion.

This game is fun. The feel of the game reminds me most of Acquire and Diplomacy. Options are endless and the game can get pretty deep and tactical. 

My friends and I tried to negotiation for a while but got quieter and quieter as we figured out how to play. Negotiation doesn't' work well because you make a deal with someone and then suddenly, they no longer control the country on your border.  

For us, the lack of useful negotiation needed is what resulted in us backing off from this game.

Two plays now.  First one was around 4 hours, second one much the same (only 2 players the same in both games).  OK, so both games were learning curves, and in particular we saw a new strategy emerge in the second, but this is still coming at a long game that is not giving the enjoyment feedback vs the length of time putting in.  I definately have some misgivings now about the use of hte word "investor" on the rondel - "Pay Dividend" would be better, and avoid confusion and mistakes to us English speakers.  I'd agree that their might still be much to discover about this game, but with some of my gaming group they are not going to be prepared to put the time in for a repeat play.

I genuinely think this game is flawed. Essentially, the Credit Value of shares in a nation rise even when the nation's empire collapses. This is totally contrary to any normal economic model. It pays to invest in a failing state, on the basis that the last taxation will push its Credit highest. Surely, the Credit Value is the Earnings per Share? Why would that rise when the value of the share has fallen. That crashing flaw aside, this is a very different game. The rondel as a mechanism did not interest me much, the fixed cycle of the nations' turns did not seem valid (why would Austria wait until russia had acted, and why would Austria always get an action before Italy??), but the separation of the players from the sates and the shifting of control by the share mechanism was interesting. The game seemed to end much too quickly for my liking, and there was too much book-keeping and general fiddliness. And I lost with half the score of the winning player.

Combines the financial system of an 18xx game, the movement and combat system of Diplomacy, and euro mechanics.  This strange mish-mash of mechanics works remarkably well to a create a tight, cohesive design.  Fantastic game.

I have played this game with 5 & 6 and enjoyed it a lot.  There are a lot of problems with 3 players: they can gang up on the 3rd; it is easier to invest in all the countries which then slows down players as they try to figure out all the possible combinations, and there is less combat because when a player owns a part of every country, he is more reluctant to attack.  I think 4 minimum, but preferably 5-6.

Having not yet tried the other wheel game, Antike, I finally discover this new mechanic which works really really well in this game.  The turn angst is constant as the round around the table goes in a flash; you always feel involved and in the middle of a difficult choice.  Not so much a wargame as a contest of power which takes the form of an investment decision.  A gem of a game.

Decent euro in a Diplomacy meets 18xx vein.  While I enjoyed the gameplay (I'm a fan of rondels), I would much rather have a more modern theme.

In our one game, I actually won by having a decent investment in the top 2 countries, never having controlled either of them, and an okay investment in the next 2 countries.  I tied at 112, and then had the most investment in the top country, even though neigher of us had control of that country.

We did a lot more attacking then probably is required for this game.

I used 'not controlling a country' to my advantage for much of the game and bought in to a few other countries just enough to be high up on them but not gaining control.  That approach, not gaining control, allowed me to get 2-3 more bonds than others.  I never upgraded any bonds, only bought new ones.

I'm not very good at this game, but I enjoy it tremendously.  After playing so many strategy-level war-type games, it's fun to play a twist on the idea: instead, the players are the dark overlords pulling the strings behind the scenes.

RATING: 5
Fascinating game where you play one level higher than normal; it's like Antike with an investment layer, and far superior.

However, I didn't like:
* the length, though the country turns were great
* how you can't sell shares
* the share upgrading mechanic locking you into particular countries
* the minimal income stream when stateless
* the few neutral territories

I still have no idea what I'm doing; I don't really like map-and-conflict games.

RATING: 10
What a delicate balance of opposing forces.  Every time you buy a bond you have to weigh the relative benefits of a tax bonus, player motivation, and bond payouts at the end and in the near future.  Add to this the decisions that take place on the board with respect to your own personal cash and the struggle for more taxes and you've truly got an exceptional game.  

The really great thing about Imperial is that I think it's approachable.  There's few people that didn't love it the first time they played, and the others eventually followed suit.

I've heard the investor card variants described as good but different games, but I feel like they're both the same.  The investor card just introduces a bit more leeway for beginners at the expense of control.  I vastly prefer the no-investor card variant now, but I'd never turn down a game with it.

C'est là ou le jeu deviens vraiment intéressant, mais aussi en éliminant la chance car il n'y a pas de dès, mais plutôt une roue ou l'on choisi nos actions et on paie pour aller plus loin si on en a besoin et les moyens.

Excellent game.  Looking forward to playing my third game.  I won my first game, but lost the second game (though both games were fun).  Keep an eye on more than just your own empire.  If you're Germany or Austro-Hungary, keep Russia on its toes or Russia will beat you.  Also, learn about the endgame.  That's the part I'm having the hardest time with (both the game I won and the game I lost).

O jogo se passa na Europa. Os jogadores são investidores que adquirem ações dos países. Não é bom se apegar aos países pois eles mudam de mão durante a partida. Do mesmo autor do Antike. Também tem a Rondel. As decisões não envolvem sorte. Somente as ações escolhida pelos jogadores para cada país que domina. Você pode construir fábricas, produzir unidades terrestres e marítimas, movimentar, investir, importar unidades e fazer taxação. Ele se passa por um jogo de guerra. Tem unidades, conflitos, territórios mas na realidade é um jogo econômico pois comandará o país ou os país o jogador que tiver mais ações daquele país. E no fim do jogo vence quem tem mais dinheiro. Bem interessante. Relativamente pesado e demorado mas vale o tempo.

Imperial manages to elegantly merge the two game categories that I most like: economics and war. 

The game appears at first sight to be mostly a war game and some players will tend to play it that way, but for me the economical (stock market) side is the most fascinating. There are truly two games being played in parallel, where war/country development influences the stock market and the contrary is even more noticeable. As country stocks can be bought by several players, partial alliances are quite common - a player may have an alliance with another for a specific country, but be in war for another country. This creates a nice platform for complex player interactions which can create tremendous fun and chaos.

Imperial asks for players which mostly favour strategy and great player interaction, but prefer simple and elegant gameplay without excessive rules/details.

Rating after only one game. It sure is a good game, and the alternating control gives it a real original twist. But I found two drawbacks. 1) There is not much point in attacking towards the middle-end of the game, as it is a race to taxation and you can win no matter wether you cash 10 or 14 each turn. 2) The winner didn't control a country for half the game and was able to secure a lot of very high payout shares this way; I believe we could have played better to stop him, but it left a strange aftertaste. I expect to revise the rating with more play (probably up to a 8 or even a 9).

RATING: 8
Navegador után nagyon érdekelt, mint annak a "harcos" változata. Az elmondások alapján egyszerűbb szabályra számítottam, de mivel csak egyetlen lépésed van minden körben így játszva már nem különösebben bonyolult. A háborúzás talán nem annyira központi, mint azt elsőre gondolnánk, de arra pont elég, hogy folyamatosan egyensúlyozni lehessen, és kelljen is. Mint minden hasonló játéknál, így itt is fontos tényező, hogy a játékosok hogy lavíroznak, mikor kit éreznek erősnek, mikor kit ütnek. Kulcsfontosságú ennek a megérzése, ami némi pszichológiát visz a játékba.

Egyetlen szabállyal volt csak bajom: a hajók egy körben csak egy embert transzportálhatnak. Nemrég játszottunk game of thrones, aminek elég hasonló az egygégmozgatási rendszere, de ott nincs ez a megkötés. Itt emiatt kicsit értéktelennek és gyengének éreztem a hajókat, valamint nem látom semmi esélyét annak, hogy interakció alakuljon ki pl. Franciaország és Oroszország között, hacsak nem igázzák le mindketten fél Európát, aminek nincs sok értelme ebben a játékban, mivel az idegen területeket csak blokkolni lehet, hasznosítani nem.

Valamiért az első játékot nem különösebben élveztem, pedig a játék mechanikája tetszene, sőt egész unikumnak a tartom, ami nálam sokat számít az értékelésben. így egyelőre csak 7.1-et adok neki.

RATING: 7
I don't feel comfortable rating this after only one play simply because I haven't fully understood the mechanics, yet. Scoring is very indirect and happens almost exclusively at the end of the game which means in your first game you pretty much have no idea what you are doing.

Update: After the second game (and one of 2030) I feel I have at least got a firm grasp on the mechanics. Still missing out on quite a bit of the subtle interdependencies, though. It looks like I can reliably manage to run "my" countries firmly into the ground...

Anyway, interesting decisions, lots of approaches to explore, heavily interactive, and somewhat hard to grasp at first, at least for players that have been exposed to Risk previously.

I have only played it once.  To me looks a mix of Acquire (trying to keep an eye on the bonds final value and putting your eggs in more than one basket) with a bit of Risk or other conquer games. It is very complicated game and needs several plays before you completely understand the game and many more plays to see the strategies. I prefer to play a simpler type of game, like either of the ones I mentioned, but I reckon that it is a very well designed game.

====

Imperial is Mac Gerdts' masterpiece. On the surface the game looks a bit like Risk. Heck, on my first play I played it like Risk and was utterly humiliated. The reason for my total defeat was that the game only uses direct conflict as a means to an end -- bond valuation. That is, the point of the game is gaining control of the production, taxation, and war efforts of countries by purchasing bonds and then using that power to drive up the value of said bonds. Perhaps war will help in doing so or perhaps not it's so hard to say for certain -- determining so is entirely situational. The point is that the game is not a war game per se, but one of subtle manipulations, fleeting alliances, bond diversification, and only occasionally war. Imperial is a game of "shadow governments" and oligarchies -- it's quit nihilistic to be quite honest -- but its nature makes for something quite special.

RATING: 9
I only don't give this a 10, because I don't have enough plays under my belt and can not know if it will pass the test of time. (Played it about 10 times so far.)
The rules are about as simple as they can be, but they build up a very rich game. There is no extra luck, and no hidden information, but all the stuff happening on the board keeps it from getting dry. Trying to find and manipulate the patterns in the chaos is a very hard and entertaining task. Its chaotic nature also keeps most players from overanalyzing things. Still, one needs to pay attention to almost every country, so it's even engaging when it's not your turn. The one complaint that I can come up with is that I find the artwork ugly.
The exceptionally elegant and innovative design plus the high player-interaction makes this a favourite of mine.

Update: it stays at 9. The beginning and the ending plays very similarly in each game, which is a bit dull.

Pretty unique blending of economic euro and wargame. The game is very strategic, fun and tense. The only drawback is it can be quite long: even when starting at 10 on the score track we rarely manage to end under 2 hours.

As a side note, I Bought Imperial 3rd Edition (2010, PD-Verlag) together with Imperial 2030 upgrade kit. Everything fits perfectly in the Imperial box and the 2030 board makes for an interesting variant (although 19,90 Euros is a bit expensive for just a new map and a couple of rule changes).

I can see why many consider this to be a very good game though.

together with Diplomacy my all time favourite game. And I discovered that the "no investor card" variant makes the game even better.

I only play with open money and refuse to play otherwise.

It took quite a while to "get" this game. But once we did, everything clicked into place and the mechanics became almost second nature. Not an easy game to win - it's easy to forget that you're an investor, and suddenly find yourself in a pointless (and costly) war. You need to keep an eye on which country is building up (which is not necessarily the leader) - that's the one to invest in and preferably control as the end can come quite suddenly, if you're not careful!

RATING: 6.5
I was really looking forward to this, but after playing it with 6 players I was thoroughly disappointed. It wasn't bad, it was just boring. I hear it is better with 4. My main issue is that it is mainly a share holding game with a very light and uninteresting wargame element to it. Add to that the rondel system just sucks as implemented in this game. Everyone ends up doing the same thing because if one power arms itself, the others must react or risk occupation. Found it very boring. The only real decisions came in what shares to invest in. What to do on the rondel was almost a given every turn. That said, it is still better than Antikke because Antike is like Imperial without shares, and the shares are the only good part of Imperial.

Though the board and components are reminiscent of the game "Diplomancy" this one is very different and much better for the difference.   The game has war and business blended together in a format that can finish in a reasonable amount of time.  This should only be played with the advanced rules.  It can suffer some serious imbalances if the players are too greatly separated in skill level.  Overall I would give kudos to the designer.

An excellent game. Watch out for letting your ego insist you "keep control" of "YOUR" countries. You need to influence them, but you don't HAVE to run them every turn. 

Revised to add: But have to watch out for "how to start". Miss too much on the first few turns and it seems impossible to catch up. 

There's the usual learning curve for this game too. Last game I asked for, and got, a lot of advice on steps and order of turns and how to plan. The result? I won, by a lot. And now I'll never get friendly advice again. sigh. And I still don't know what to do next.

This is an interesting mix between Antike and 18xx games. But in the first (and only) game I twice got stuck without a great power to govern.

True it was depending on inexperienced bad gaming, but still this is a MAJOR FLAW in the game. There was another player who also got stuck this way once.

A very good game that intertwines economics, nation building and combat. It usually takes a game or two to wrap your mind around the concept but is great once you do. Especially like how you can be competitors and partners with your opponents and how control of a nation can switch. Always keeps it exciting.

Played 5+ times. This game might be a little too complicated for me. I am spending too much time trying to work out the rules leaving no time to plan for good play. *UPDATE* Played with 6 mostly new players and it was all a bit much. It took 3.5 hours with explanation. I had not played for 3 years. While I still have the rules in my head I am itching to play a proper game of this with 4 or 5 all experienced players. My respect for the game has gone up but it is more in the expectation that I will find it great rather than my experience to date. Jan 10

Rating based on one play. This was an interesting combination of Risk and Acquire, but not quite as good as either. Even though it has those similarities, it is important to remember that one cannot win by playing it solely like either one of them. A balanced strategy is necessary to fully realize potential. Definitely deserves another play, but I'm not sure if it is worth all the praise.

Much later (years?), I finally got in another play and I liked it considerably better. I did very poorly, but I think it was mainly because one player attacked me rather than further his own empire. Everyone else lived peacefully and did far better.

It's absolutely necessary to play with the alternative without investment card. This plays very well and is much better than the "advanced rules" including investment card. It is however also possible to play as a lighter game with basic rules (and IC) - but that would earn the game only rate 7.

RATING: 7
You don't possess any countries. I get annoyed when control of a country that I have been developing is taken off me.

Combat is predictable and a bit dull - you simply trade losses down to last man standing.

I think it might be better with 4 players as opposed to 5. With 4 players there is less competition for control of counties which increases your chances of playing a more active role in the game. I have only played it twice - once with 4 players, once with 5. In the 5 player game I found myself without a country to control for a lot of the game. Turns are by country not by player. I did reasonably well as I invested in the right countries but felt a bit disengaged from the game.

In the 4 player game there was too much analysis paralysis. The use of an egg-timer made the 5 player game run smoothly and quickly. 

Criticisms aside it's a good game - unusual, original and multi-layered.

An excellent and different take on the period. I am not sure if the sit back and let everyone else run things approach isn't too powerful but I expect to play more than enough to find out.

After the second game my rating dropped from 9. I suddenly realised how few meaningful and unscripted choices there actually were compared to the length of the game. Not a bad game and gets points for original structure of the mechanics and flow. Just not as good as it seemed the first time I played.

After third game the rating dropped again, the downward spiral doesn't seem to pull up anytime soon. Drop the playing time to half and I might try this again.

RATING: 8
Shows how good a euro can be when there is tons of interaction.   The central mechanic of owning stock and controlling countries and the fighting over territory, battles, etc leads to all the interaction.  You might control a country one minute and be fighting against it in just a few turns.  The math can bother you a little and the game could benefit from unpredictability in combat, IMO, but I'm probably in a very small minority of imperial players on those issues.  The only real concern with the game is some kingmaking.  Its a top 10 game in my opinion and I think with time its BGG rating will show that.  

This is probably my favorite euro-style game.  

Update:  Many plays later I still really like this game, but I no longer feel it is a world beater destined for the top 10.  I dropped the rating down because the game strongly depends on the players playing sheriff and watching each other for it's balance.  In a way it is unfair to knock a game for this.  Any game which is significantly interactive and uses a VP scoring system is going to have this issue.  Problem is, after playing a lot of games of imperial, if you aren't all watching each other like hawks someone always seems to sneak one by.  Part of that is why I like it so much, but I now recognize that it is a flaw in its own way too.  Still one of my favorite games.

RATING: 5
Solid but neither of the rules for how purchasing work  - passing around investment marker or purchasing after every action - seem to quite fit right. The former injects money (good) but can hurt badly if you miss a purchase near the end of the game (which is very hard to control in a six-player game, and Imperial is best with the full count). The latter results in a cash-poor game where you very well may never have control of a nation again if you lose yours early and your investments don't pay out quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating after one play.  Cool idea for a game, unique system... still not sure how well it fits together.

We played with the investor card, which seemed to really limit the amount of investing you could do.  A lot of "investments" were actually purchased toward the end of the game when their value was fairly secure.  We played with 5 players and the final scores ranged from 91 to 110, which felt almost artificially close.  The winner actually lost control of government about halfway through the game and then was able to build a very diversified portfolio while the rest of us struggled for the opportunity to buy any bonds at all.  It seemed wrong that a player should be so heavily rewarded for something (not having any flags) they had little to no control over.  I had one flag at the time and a fair amount of cash and would've given anything to lose my flag and be in his position.

The end game was pretty unsatisfying.  The return value of the each available bond was easily calculated, and there seemed to be no interesting choices left but to buy the bond with the best (immediate) return on investment.  It also seems like there should be some risk involved in the bond market (for example if a country completely collapses or is occupied by enough enemy forces, the bonds wouldn't pay at the end of the game)

RATING: 7
An interesting take on ANTIKE, but more complex.  The action "wheel" is still present, and works similarly, although there is one spot which triggers the Investment sub-phase whenever a Country Action Token moves on or over it!

Each player will be playing two roles during the game.  That of an Investor, purchasing Bonds from the various Countries, and that of a Government, deciding when to tax, produce units, move/attack as well as when to pay dividends.

Managing both of these can be difficult, as players may purchase Bonds on any Country, and the player with the most Bonds (total) forms the new Government (i.e. controls that Country).

Initially players may have difficulties as to where the money is placed.  When a Country plays the Tax action, the money generated, if any, gets added to that Country's treasury.  When the Country pays it's inventors, the money is taken from the Country's Treasury and paid to the players holding Bonds.

So you'll be spending your money investing in different Countries, which you can be certain will change hands more than once during the game.  In the end, it is the player with the most money (cash on hand   value of all Bonds) who wins.

Although I rated this a '7', I think my rating will go up after a few more plays.

RATING: 7.5
Imperial is likely the best rondel game Gerdts has created, and possibly the best game overall period.

The game play is as straightforward as other rondel games, but the consequences of those choices- especially around the investor action- can be major, and involve other players in an opportunity to change the status quo.

To my knowledge, none of the other rondel games do this- with the possible exception of military actions in Antike- and none play with the pieces quite so much, and yet affect perhaps less than they seem.

The goals of the game is to finish with the most cash.  To do this, players optimize national bonds issued by pre-WWI European nations, in order to control the countries' actions, in order to build up their Tax and Power values, and in order to rake cash dividends from the nations.

Some would say it is Diplomacy (setting) meets 18XX (stock owenership)- but because of the rondel making actions less repeatable it has it's own flavour, and the actions take less hard fiscal calculation than an 18XX.

I like it a lot- glad I picked up a copy- and expect that eventually this will surpass previous Gerdt favorites Concordia and Navegador.

This is a great game with simple mechanics that aren't simple, but which also do not induce major AP.

The wooden bits are classic, but very cool- a great purchase, I predict.

The production value of this game is obviously high, so it's a shame the art couldn't have been a *little* more appealing.

That said, the game has seen a few plays after a disastrous first encounter (don't start your first game after midnight with six new players trying to figure this one out!) and it's becoming very popular in our group.

Once you click that countries are nothing more than bloating piggy bank pinata's, waiting for a well-aimed swing, the game kicks into high gear.

We play with the No Investor card as well as the Investor card variants to speed up the game.

Furthermore, if a factory is destroyed, we award the conquering nation +3 on the victory track.

RATING: 8
What happens when Antike and 18XX slam into each other? You get Imperial. The simple action rondel mechanism, and simple movement and combat system, combine with the stock market complexities from 18XX. No single player "owns" a country, except as indicated by the number of shares he has invested in that country. The players' money are separate from the countries' money, like in 18XX or Chicago Express. The key is how to get the money in the countries' treasuries back into one's own pocket, so that he can buy more shares of a country that is doing well, or buy a controlling stake in another country, previously "owned" and "run" by another player. The game is much slower, in terms of physical movement, since the emphasis is on economics and not conquest; it is near impossible to take over another country, and it is something you probably don't want to--it is simply too expensive and takes too long to accomplish. It plays tactically a lot like Diplomacy, as it has a similar board and layout, but production plays heavily into conquering new lands instead of negotiating support from your allies. Diversification may do well, if you are able to buy shares in several countries that are doing well on the VP track, but getting money to buy those shares is difficult if you've made some poor choices early on, or your country isn't doing so well. Fascinating dichotomy between investing and expansion. I prefer Antike for its purity, and straightforward fast play, but would rather play this instead of an 18XX game if I want a stock market game, with a touch of war, all in about two hours.

A "wareuro".  Trying to "bank" your way to the top of the heap as you buy and sell bonds, tax, wheel and deal during WWI can be an interesting challenge.

A simple combat system and overall mechanics translate into an enjoyable dash for the cash.

If you can accept the rather odd premise of being a shareholder in the imperial powers of Europe, then this is a reasonable maximise-your-holding game.  The map looks almost uncannily like a Diplomacy board, but it's badly missing the presence of Turkey. This gives Austria and Russia a free run at the Balkans while it's far less likely that Britain (for instance) will be an expansionist power, which makes some countries a much more attractive investment than others. Unlike 18xx, shares have no current value, so you can't sell any duds that you pick up near the start. Some multiplayer chaos in which share tiles are available and as a portfolio of small tiles has a better return than a single large one, this is a factor in who wins. The 2030 sequel has a more open board, but includes the same issues.

The part that plays like a blend of an economics/war game is great, but it has potential to go for too long and drag towards the end. Best when played with a house rule that anyone can invest in anything when investor is landed chosen.

I'm not a fan of stock holding games and prefer Antike since I like to think of my pieces as mine.

RATING: 7
There's lots to like here--this is the only rondel game I've played, and it's a fun mechanism.  Understanding countries in terms of stocks is something that, as far as I know, is unique to this game and a pretty cool idea.  The part that bugs me is that not playing is actually a valid strategy. Also, it feels as if the real game begins about 2/3 of the way in and all the territory grabs of the past 2.5 hours are really just prelude. (2 plays)

RATING: 9
Totally different to any game I have played before.. It's like a cross between 18xx and Diplomacy (but much faster play).  With the investor card, the change of powers was very frequent and exciting to experience.  The best players are the ones that can detach themselves from the country(ies) they are running which is much easier said than done!  

After 10 plays, I have to bump this up to a 9 as it's simply beautifull

A great spin on economic games! If you think you're playing a war game, you're screwed! The game forces you to watch other players, and the countries to determine the best investment opportunities. Will play this anytime!

RATING: 8
The second rondel game, and a mix of the military (from Antike) and the economic (from Hamburgum).  It's a good mix and works well with five or fewer players - with 6 players there's a good chance that someone will have nothing to do for a lot of the game.  I like playing it, and would want to play it more, but I wouldn't be surprised if "normal"/"standard"/"strongest" opening moves emerge that take out a lot of the early decision tree, leaving everyone rushing to the middle game.  As I like to experiment, I'll avoid reading such strategies and find out for myself.  It can be strange finding yourself on both sides of a conflict, or suddenly losing control of the nation that you've developed form the beginning, but it's a refreshing change to the usual empire builder games.

If you get the chance, try this game, it deserves a rating of 8

Don't be confused by the box: This is really not a 6 player game. All countries starting with a dominant shareholder tends to mean players just strengthen their holding in their start country, and thus no countries can change hands. The game is therefore reduced to a dull wargame.

With 4 or 5 (ideally 4) the game is much more interesting, as the shares and economics become the focus of the game. Invest in the right countries, and extract as much cash as you can from those you control, while still trying to get them a good end-game bonus.

Imperial 2030 has a few small improvements that make it the better game, but plain Imperial isn't too shabby either.

Balance the countries you control with buying shares in other successful countries. Do wars that pay you go dividens in a few goes - liked it but I need the game to last longer with more depth, more shares, more swings in ownership and more tactical choices. NOW someone at the table regulaly breaks the game by just paying the nominal two money to jump round the wheel fast after one or two phases. This game would be a lot more intresting if everyone developped countries or used 3,4 or 5 of the rondel choices rather than just 3 choices twice then just two in a race to end the game.

Originale incrocio tra un gioco di espansione territoriale e un gestionale. Controllare una nazione non implica automaticamente che si cerchi di svilupparla e rafforzarla, anzi, a volte l’unico scopo è quello di depredarla dei propri averi. Cinica ma realistica simulazione della corsa al perseguimento del proprio interesse personale. Molto azzeccata l’ambientazione.

I currently (fall 2014) have a moderately intense infatuation with Imperial.  Imperial is essentially a stock market game with a delightful twist: the players are international bankers who invest in the great powers of Europe before the dawn of World War I.  Essentially, the game opens withe the players holding varying levels of investment in the different nations.  The player holding the greatest bond value in each nation controls the actions of a particular nation.  Control of nations will pass from one player to another several times during the game when the new owner lends a large sum of funds to the nation, thus making him the player with the greatest level of investment.  The player who has accumulated the greatest personal wealth, which is separate from the nations' treasuries, when the game ends is the winner.   The game looks like a war game; there are naval units and armies that do combat.  But if you try to play this game like a military conquest game, you are doing it wrong and will likely lose badly.  I love Mac Gerdts' series of games that use the rondel for action selection.  The rondel dramatically reduces down time between turns.  Games with the rondel have a strong tendency to promote a pleasantly flowing game rhythm.  Imperial is radically different from any game I've ever played, so I find it very fascinating.  Imperial is like some kind of bastard child whose parents are a modern economic Euro game and and oldschool light conquest game.  There is no chance in the game at all--no dice or cards.  The fun and challenging part to Imperial is being wise in which country to invest in.

Finally had a chance to give this another go.  Terrific experience.

A little long (at least the first couple times playing), but time flies.  The game goes a lot faster once everyone has a play or two under their belts.

Key concept to internalize when playing - This is NOT a wargame, it's an investment game.  The military units are just a means to expand (temporarily) a given country's tax base.

great all around game.  One of my favorites for the level of strategy and interaction.  Haven't made my mind up on the investor card vs open buying variant.  Have played several time both ways but more plays required.  The game is quite different with the additional money in circulation, and there is some strategy in stalling/cycling to transfer the investor card.

Wow, that was a lot of fun!  It takes a medium investment game and a medium war game and slams them together into a lot of fun.

The rules actually are very accessible as long as at least one person knows them well enough to teach.  And the story that unfolds is absolutely hilarious to me.  In my fist playing, I controlled Austria for most of the game and just treated it like crap, continually slamming it into Italy just so I could grow Russia unmolested.  I still lost, but only because someone else matched my investment in Russia on the last turn.

The rondel is neat, and this is twice the game Antike is.  Anything that seemed dry and calculated in Antike gets thrown out of the window when you start investing in countries and feed your inner war profiteer.

Wow.  The interaction of the roundel and the countries which change controllers during the game makes for a engrossing experience that I can't wait to repeat.

The single flaw I found to the game so far is the fact that it is possible to be locked out of country control right after all countries passed investment on the roundel, which will lead to doing nothing for a while without any chances to influence this.  This is more likely to appear in a 6 players game.

I've played a games with 2, 3, 4 and 5 players. While Imperial may lack something as a 2-player game, it plays very well with 3-5 players. I see Imperial primarily as an investment game, with the military aspects providing an interesting additional facet. On balance, I like the Investor Card mechanism as it can make the timing of actions crucial, though it does seem to bring too much money into 3 and 4-player games. There is, of course, no element of chance in Imperial. Still, the end result - especially in 5-player games - can sometimes be hostage to the decision of a player or players who are not in contention to win (a type of kingmaking, albeit rather subtle).

This is one of the more important Essen '06 releases for me.  I am not a fan of Antike, but by changing the player's role from king to investor, Imperial addresses all of my complaints with that earlier title.  Its a little bit counterintuitive as the map and countries are so familiar.  You will feel you are playing Diplomacy, but wrapping yourself with a particular country is a grave mistake.  This game is all about investments.  When its going south, switch ships, even with a minority position.  The only thing that matters is cash at the end.  I loved the Rondle in Antike, it works equally well here.  I imagine downtime with more than 4 would be sub optimal, but I was engaged throughout our 3 hours of play.

RATING: 7
Not a bad game.  A bit confusing, the mechanics take a while to get used to.  Players can get stuck without a country too easily.  That's actually not a bad strategy once you get the hang of the game, but early on it makes it feel like you got screwed.

Stock-holding mixed with spatial elements that aren't trains. The rondel puts a heavy focus on timing and tempo. The early game is very ambiguous...strong advantage to those who can see through the fog before their opponents.

This is not a wargame. This is a stock-taking game where war is an important element. To hurt a player, attack their stock, not necessarily the countries they control!

RATING: 6.5
This is actually a solid game which I have a problem to master.

Innovative idea of struggle for control over the countries and changing 'ownership' of them.  Nice balance between military operations and actions increasing the power/wealth of countries players control.

There are 2 problems:
- the game is a bit too long (~3h with just 4 players)
- the game is _NOT_ for 5-6 players
[The game is UN-PLAY-ABLE with 6 players (no control of a country by 1-2 player(s) for a _long_ time).  It's very long (4h) and tiresome too...

With 5 it's better, but still there might be periods when a player does not control a country - these periods are however shorter than with 6p. and bearable in some cases.

Not controlling a country means not only boredom during a game, but most importantly no chance of winnning (most frequently), because of Taxation, which gives payouts only to players with control.  And snowball effect occurs - controllers get richer while non-controllers don't - and they are often powerless to do anything.]

The sweet spot is 4 players.  And it might be fine with 3 too, but I have to try it first...

EDIT: After 8 plays I'm full.  I feel I've explored the game enough.  I don't have a desire for repeated plays.  At least not so often to justify possessing a copy.

Sold.

Great economic game of shifting alliances that has a very different experience depending on who you play with.  It can be very aggressive and warlike or much more cooperative or (usually) a nice mix of both.  By far the best of the 3 rondel games and a game that I am always up for playing.  Play with poker chips and open money though.  You can play on BSW as well but you lose some of the interesting player interaction that goes on (in my games as least).  I can see how this would be a little less fun with groups that don't have much table talk but I love the diplomacy aspect of the game -- "you really need to attack Germany because he is clearly winning" or "I'm obviously doing a great job running Russia for us so you should buy France instead".  This is a very interactive game and definitely not another multiplayer solitaire like some of the current hot games (I'm looking at you Agricola and Dominion).

I feel like I should enjoy this more than I actually do. It's tight and has a delicate balance. There are critical decisions to be made throughout. However, the game and board play fail to engage me. I feel like I'm just sitting there most of the time. Again, I don't know why this would be--nearly every other game has times where you're "just sitting there. Imperial should interest nearly any boardgaming type--war, economic, diplomatic--but probably wouldn't accommodate a mix of these types. For instance, I'd personally hate the game if it were bogged down in an endless discussion of alliances--"who will do what when and where"; others might love that sort of thing.Still, a 6.5. And I can't see too many people hating this.

After one play I'm still not sure about this game. It's going to take at least one more play to see how it shapes up. Unfortunately we played slow and didn't have a chance to finish the first game. We played with the Investor card which seems to slow the pace of the game down. Next time we play we'll play without it and see if the game plays better.

Overall, I liked it.

5/20 I played a second game, still very slow (4 hours!) with a mostly new crowd. I won, unexpectedly at the end. It's definitely worth it to become country less in the game early and pick up all the low cost Bonds. Even though in this game I Ian and Tim (from Atlanta) beat me to it, I still benefited from being the third person to be country less for a significant time period. 
I'm bumping the rating of the game from a 7 to an 8 after the second play, and the Weight from a Medium to a Medium Heavy.

I was surprised to like this game because it's fairly heavy and long, while the over/under on my game preferences is short and light.  It's an intriguing cross between Acquire and Diplomacy.  In my only play so far, I finished way, way back from the others (who were reasonably close to each other).  I think I just spent the whole game zigging when I should have zagged.  Somehow, that didn't turn me off to it.  I probably won't suggest it, but will probably play it at some point when someone else does.

There are some comparisons to 18XX except of course instead of building railroad and delivering goods, the railroad companies are replaced with countries, who generate income based on how many factories and neutral territory they control (minus number of ships/army units).  Also unlike 18XX there is no stock round, instead one (unless any players don't control any country) player only gets to buy (and you can never SELL!)... this can swing the game sadly, I would have come in 2nd anyway in my 1st game but the 1st place player really locked in the win as he was last one who could buy stock.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (September 2011)

I had such high hopes for Imperial..... it is as of today (19/09/2011) number 37 in the ranking here on BGG, I think it is a good to regular game but not a great one. I find Imperial to be very sluggish so I was bored between turns. I really like the idea of the game, its zero luck factor and the stock manipulation required to win.... but the execution of those ideas leave much to be desired (you can win by doing almost nothing as other players can run the countries for you leaving you with little to do). Also the manual is ambiguous in a lot of situations and the game can take a lot of time.  

You can tell it is from the same guy that designed Antike (which I like more) but the Rondel mechanic is beginning to bother me, I feel it makes its games slow.

In conclusion Imperial has some nice ideas but it fails to excite me. I’m glad I didn’t buy it.

Play the version where you go around the table investing in countries rather than a random distribution of tiles and it's a better game.  It's very interesting and opportunistic if a little abstracted.  You wouldn't have a battle so you reduce your expenses to troops in the real world but that makes it amusing in that way.

RATING: 9
Disentangling players from specific countries seems obvious in retrospect but was genius.  I will never turn this game down.  It is an experience comparable to an 18XX game in a tight 2-hour package, with pre-war Europe as the playing ground.

All player numbers from 3-6 work, but in different ways.  3-player is a ridiculously volatile good time -- though you can hide out and control no countries if you really work at it.  4-player is a good "base" setup.  5 and 6 play more like investment games, and I think introduce enough complexity in the incentive structures to discourage really analytical play; I have to play a 5-6 player game by feel.

With the investor card I don't like that the initial Austria controller has fewer investment opportunities - only a problem with the basic setup but I've been in a couple teaching games recently.

Without the investor card - so much more control!  A somewhat different playstyle is required though, as one can't rely on the free payouts anymore.  I don't know if I'd recommend playing without the investor card to inexperienced players but with an experienced group it's definitely the way to go.

I'm on the brink of just declaring I won't play with the investor card anymore.  I've had more than one frustrating game recently where I control Austria and get hamstrung by a lack of investment opportunities.

RATING: 10
Wonderful, wonderful game.

It carries forward the best bits of the designer's earlier Antike (the rondel and the way it splits the play down into small chunks, of which there never seem to be enough to do everything you want) while improving on the context. 

I find Antike's weaker elements to be the card collection mechanisms used to gain victory points. The use of investments to change control of countries, and the game-end value of your investments being the lion's share of your score, lift the game above Antike (good game though that is) and a lot of other Euro strategy games.

I love the constant flux within the game, as countries that were enemies become friends (and vice versa), and a countries that looked like  lions become pups (and vice-versa again).

While it's not cheap, the production values are excellent.

Warning: played with more than 4, players can find themselves without control of a country for long periods of the game. This doesn't stop them doing well if they invest wisely, but does make for two hours of extreme tedium for the affected player as they watch everyone else play the game and only get to make an investment decision every twenty minutes or so. I'd either stick with 4 players, or use the optional rule that gives players without a country an extra million to invest at investment time.

RATING: 7.5
Quite a high rating given that I spent the last half of my first game able to do nothing - very little money and no country ownership meant that I just watched as the game trundled onwards and groaned as people running the countries I was invested in didn't take the investment option.  Still left intrigued and determined next time not to let myself get into such a hole.

Reminiscent of 18xx and Antike, without the length of either or the endgame problems of the latter.  Once you wrap your brain around the fact that it's not a wargame nor are you representing a country, this is an excellent game.

I love money games... and I also liked playing Antike.  So when Imperial was showed up , I had to buy a copy.

Even though the designer is the same... the ONLY thing similar to Antike is the Rondel for action selection... the game is completely different.

As a person who likes a little chaos in his games... I should note that there is virtually NO control in this game.  The ownership of the major powers will change often and you really have to know what you are doing.  You can do well by not controlling a power... but it takes a lot of knowledge of the game to do so. The one saving grace is the 'Investor' card which allows you some chance to get back in the game (unlike other players who say otherwise, I would never play the game without it. The game becomes much too long!).

Can be an unforgiving game... but unlike games like Age of Steam where you have a very difficult time getting back into the game once you fall behind, you never seem to be completely "out-of-the-running."  One shrewd purchase can get you back into the game very quickly.

After playing again on BSW (with the optional start rules) my enjoyment of the game, and my rating, has gone up.

Great game, love the rondel mechanic. Upon our first play we did somethings wrong and we corrected them, but I believe the outcome would have been the same.  We played with 5 and the only player that had played the game before crushed the rest of us.  This is a game you have to have experience at playing before you will be able to compete with other experienced players.  This game doesn't rely on luck to balance the experienced and unexperience players, which I like alot even though I was the big looser of the first game and owned the most countries.

Didn't quite grok the subtleties of timing here. I definitely followed the advice of not getting to attached to any one particular country, but I had a hard time figuring out when to invest and in whom. I missed out on a good chunk of money by trying to expand Germany's territory one last time before taxing again, but the game ended. 

There seem to be some similarities to [gameid=5], which I also needed to play a handful of times before it started to click. The board and components are up to nice Eurogame standards. 

Would like to try again.

Very good investment game where players take control of different countries as long as they have lent to country more money than anyone else. There is some conflict in the game but you can really see the ebb and flow on the board as different countries expand before taxation and then contract as the next superpower comes in to take control.

RATING: 5
A relatively simple war game with a genius economic twist built on top of it. Major flaws are too many situations that have us looking up rules and my brain is too fried at the end. Also, I would like more variance between my best interests and the interests of the country I'm controlling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I've enjoyed all the rondel games I've played, but this is clearly the best. Every country needs to balance investment with production, expansion with protection - and every player needs to decide when and what countries are worth investing in and how far to dive in. It feels like such a unique combination of military build up and dispassionate investment (dispassionate because getting too attached to a single country seems like a sure way to lose). Good investments piggyback on what other players have accomplished. My favorite games are those with relatively simple rules but support open, dynamic, complex and creative play. Imperial really fits my definition for a great game.

Players play major international investors who puchase the bonds of major countries in order to dictate what actions those countries perform. Whomever possess the highest bond in a country (whomever has paid that country the most money) controls that country. There are 6 european countries and players can control many or none, depending on how they've invested. It is the countries that take the turns, not the players. Countries build factories in order to produce ground or sea units to take over neutral countries (and collect taxes and points from them) or to disrupt the operations of other major powers (no money or points come from this action, though). Countries can also buy units (mercenaries) rather than producing them. Players can force countries to pay dividends to the bond holders (players) who have a stake in that country. And finally, the country can collect tax revenues. The more taxes a country collects, ultimately the more valuable that country is in victory points.

That's really all there is to it. The rest of the game is about countries using these actions to jockey for the tax dollars. The direction and focus that countries can take seem to be pretty broad. As players begin to invest in multiple countries, suddenly multiple interests are at stake, which leads to table talk and informal negotiations. You have to keep in mind that as a player you are not one country, but an investor in whatever countries you think will do well at the end of the game. You don't necessarily need to control a country to get a lot of points from it, but you do want to ensure your investments are protected and that your countries are giving you the return you expected. Control of countries can change hands multiple times. Final scores are determined by mulitplying the dividend amount on your country bonds by the power rating for that country (which only increases through taxation, remember). Then you add in left over player cash and declare a winner.

UPDATE: Upgraded from a 9 to 10. This game is a future classic. I can't think of anything that isn't perfect!

I enjoy watching the countries cycle through expansion and contraction, building successively bigger waves toward investment and taxation. Those who strive to hold onto to "their" country will find themselves frustrated by their inability to hold territories; those who wander aimlessly without ever controlling a country will miss out on the joy of creating those rhythmic financial waves. 

Throughout my plays I was reminded of Chicago Express. The two share stock-holding, investment, and portfolio diversification but elicit different emotional responses via their themes. Ultimately I prefer Chicago Express as it provides a similar experience in less than an hour and allows all investors to run operations.

After about 25 plays, have to go with this game as the best one of the recent year (going back to Essen 2006).  It makes excellent use of the Rondel device introduced by the same designer in Antike, but what makes this game succeed whereas Antike does not, is that the tension is there from the beginning as the pressure is on to invest in the best countries, to decide when to up and protect your investments, and when to let them go.  Despite the nice-looking toy cannons and boats, this is NOT a wargame.  It's primarily an investment/economic game, kind of a cross between 18xx and say, Diplomacy.  The game seems to start very slowly and take a long time to develop, but once nations start taxing in the 12-15 range, it can move quite rapidly.  Several variants have been suggested, but in my mind the game is just fine as it is.

After a few plays I feel I can judge this to be one of my favourites - I've only played with the full compliment of 6 players and it plays really well with this number.  Takes a bit of getting used to the fact you are not playing a country and they change hands during the game - also tricky to explain to new players that it is not a military conquest game - its a money game. Once the concepts sink in its a cracker!

RATING: 6
Imperial is an investing game with a conflict theme. Each player represents a wealthy banking family with heavy investments in one or more of the six pre-WWI Imperial powers. You treat the countries like companies, and your investments in them like a portfolio. Some military force (emphasis on the "some") boosts a country's economic position, but players who focus on conquest in control will lose badly. Watch your cash and your bond values. Look for ways to raise them. Make sure your stakes aren't bought out from under you at key moments. Invading territory is a relatively minor part of all this.

Update: I think I'm lukewarm Rondel games in general. Princes of Macchu Pichu is especially eye-opening in that regard, as the "multi-directional, exclusive rondel with clients" seems a whole lot more interesting. 

[b]Final Word[/b]: I have a begrudging respect for the design here, but the Investor Card is complete nonsense and the advanced game just is not that enjoyable for me. This is an ugly-slog-through-the-mud sort of game with few options.

The downside with this game is that You don't have the possibility to re-position your investments, And that makes the game quite static.

Imperial is a congenial combination of 18xx-type investment, the patented Gerdts rondel and a pseudo-wargame. The twist is that players perceiving and playing it as a wargame are doomed to lose to shrewd investors knowing when to jump on a train and not sinking more money into a losing proposition.

In head-to-head comparison, this wins out over its younger brother Imperial 2030. I like the tight map and scarce premiums for country leaders on taxation better. Unluckily, only the 2030 version gets played in my groups.

As a fan of "Confessions of an Economic Hit Man," I was bound to love this game. It's hard to wrap your head around the idea that you don't have to throw all your money into your starting country. Once you start taking over other people's countries, the real fun of this game comes forward. It's a lot of fun, but a very long game (2-3 hours). I prefer Chicago Express as a shorter game with some similar mechanics.

RATING: 7
I really enjoy this game.  The aspect of not really running a country, just investing in it give it a bit of an 18XX feel for me.  The "do I go to war or do I run peacefully" aspect makes it interesting, and having to outguess other players all make it an enjoyable experience for me.

RATING: 9
An absolutely sterling game that blends Euro elements with some nice direct conflict. The rondel mechanism is well implemented and not too restrictive; options seem well balanced on the "wheel" in just the right proportion and order. All the pieces seem to fit pretty well here, and there are some good decisions to be made. After a second play, in which I finished last (as opposed to winning the first game), my opinion of this game only improves. It's long but still quite relaxed and provokes some trash talking and quasi-"understandings" with your neighbors. I think the simplicity of the combat contributes in a good way to the lightness of the game--this is not a war game, folks--and neither combat nor economic expansion/development feels too powerful or important. The real strategy is to hitch your wagon to the right stars--ideally, the top three countries in terms of stock-value multiplier and to loot the countries for money, not become attached to them. Controlling blocs of countries can be extremely powerful, as you can, say, demilitarize an area; however, you can't count on keeping that bloc, and the larger the bloc the bigger the target on your back. True, the endgame is essentially the same every time, with the military campaigning ending in a rush to tax and invest, but even so the game doesn't feel samey; indeed, no two games have ever felt that similar, and none have lost my interest. In short, this is the best non-series game I've ever played, and it's clearly the acme of the rondel series.

When I can get my group to play this instead of 7 Wonders or Dominion, it is by far my favorite game.

I was initially very impressed with this cross between Diplomacy and 1830 effort. Unfortuantely, I've come to avoiding playing it after witnessing the same old Investor/Taxation spin cycle endgame one too many times. It feels like a puzzle that's been solved. Limited replayability.

RATING: 8
Impressive game.  I bet that most people that approach this game make the same initial mistake that we did of playing it as a conquest game, especially after having played Antike.  About halfway through the first game, everything clicked and the strategies became more apparent.  I almost started thinking of it as Lost Cities (probably because of the colors), and I instantly regretted having too diverse of a bond portfolio.  There seems to be a fine line between building up your empires so that you can personally profit through interest on your bonds and letting others do the work for you, stepping in at an opportune time.  I like how the combat is simple and not always the most attractive option.  The game length is manageable, though I would like to get it down to well under 2 hours.  The game artwork is a little disappointing, with garish colors and unattractive design choices.  I look forward to more play, as I can see how the game will improve, due to better player choices and decreased play time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
An interesting empire-control game where control of a country passes from player to player. The game itself is pretty chaotic and its hard to see which countries are doing well until midgame. Between Antike, I think this is the better game. However one thing which I did not like was the fact that players can be forced to (or choose to) do nothing the entire game.

The game feels a bit like betting on a horse. At some point you will commit your resources to backing a particular country (or countries) and you're hoping that they finish first in the race. You'll want to share enough control with other players so that they'll help push your horse to the finish line, but right before the end, you snatch the majority ownership of the horse.

A really, really good stock game that just happens to be a bit too long for my liking. Especially late game investment decisions might cause some AP. But I really like it mechanically, I like the board layout and I like the rondel. What I like too is that actual battling is secondary and because of that the battling system has been made so simple that it's actually taking no time at all. Beware of the Swiss bankers. Driving a player into that position might be dangerous if he is lacking a direct interest in getting out of the situation.

RATING: 9.5
I like this game because the rules are simple and elegant, and yet they tangle up wonderfully to make a complex but fast-moving, fluid, strategic brain burner of perfect information, tension and frustration. 

Firstly, whatever you manage to do to advance the interests of one or other Great Power, your efforts may be turned against you as another financier takes over control of the government and your plans are turned to ash. 

Secondly, you want the government of any Great Power that you (temporarily) control to increase its tax base, because this increases the worth of its bonds - of which you hold the greatest number. There are two ways to increase tax: build factories, or send out armies and fleets to bring lands and seas under your government’s sway. But armies and fleets need to be paid, which reduces net tax. So you need to try to rid yourself of armies and fleets just before you tax the nation - which can only be done through war. Yes, you wage war, and suicidal war at that, just to get rich. Cynical? Moi?

But though wars make you rich, the game isn’t a war game, for all that there I sometimes sense a faint whiff of Risk. But it could hardly be further from Risk in its concept or mechanics. To start with, there are no dice, and luck plays no part. Countries are never owned outright; you may own a government for now, but someone else also has shares, and may buy enough bonds next turn to rob you of the ownership of the country entirely. The interplay of struggle on the board and struggle in the stock market makes for a rich and complex jumble of interactions between the players.

The theme works well, and the rules work well within the theme. The “tax” conceit doesn’t quite work thematically, however. The tax on foreign nations might be thought of as tribute, but what the tax on the ocean spaces might be is anyone’s guess - revenue from protected fisheries, perhaps, or from state-sponsored piracy?

This feels very much like a game that will grow on me the more I play it and the more I understand its complexities.

It may be not completely fair for me to rate this game.  I only played once, did well (I won) but had a very bland and bored time with it.  It seems alot of Euros over the last year are pretty much the same game...the same experience...the same victory conditions...the same mechanics...blah, blah, blah.I would certainly give it another chance, but am in no hurry to do so.  Maybe it was just a mood I was in in regards to new Euros, but this felt ho-hum.

[LUP 17-Jun-2007] Still a little undecided on this.  I like it and think it is a good game, but the concept and reality of not controlling a country for potentially lengthy periods of the game makes me think twice.  In a game of this at the Australian Games Expo I was sans country for a good forty-five minutes.  I still came second and if England had scored one more point, I would have come first, so it is not as if it detracts from your overall performance in the game, however it does make the journey to the end of the game a little less appealing.

While this is one of the longer playing games I own, I really enjoy it. After the few plays I've had, I finally see the strategy involved in the game, and I love it. While my wife usually crushes me in the beginning of the game, she hasn't quite figured out the endgame like I have. This makes for some down to the wire wins that I've pulled off. The only reason this isn't a 10 is that the long play time means it won't hit the table frequently.

Rated after 3 plays.
Third play with 3 players, plays well with this many, our game ended with a three point difference from first to third, in which I came third for buying the wrong share in my last investment purchase.
Second play with 6 players, won with 111 points. Only controlled a country for maybe 2 turns the whole game. Lowered rating for this reason. Good game, but not one I would want to play all the time.

First game 6 player game.Didn't know what I was doing for the first part of the game, but ended up winning in the end with 135. This game is a bit on the longer side, but it's incredibly engaging through out and the time passes fast. Game play is quite fast, with very little down time, only when someone is deciding what to invest in. A lot to pay attention to in this game since you don't necessarily own (or control) a country for the whole game.

So far each time I've played this we've avoided turning this into a diplomacy game, whew!  I've enjoyed each play, and although we've had some debacles with the rules, the game has endured through the inadvertant variants visited upon it rather handily.  But I do feel a bit wary of this game.  It has some quality that keeps me a bit unsettled.

Played the game with 3,4,5 and 6 players.
From my experience 3 or 4 players was definitely better.  I think most people like to have control of at least one country to feel like they are doing something.

Have also played with the advanced rules and that is the way I would prefer to play. Would caution that is can be a frustrating game for a new player.  Players need to grasp the idea that they ARE NOT a country but are an investor. Highlighting the ways a new player can benefit from his investments is important.

Game can take a little long for what it is....

Looks like a wargame, but is really an economic game, with the ability to hammer somebody's economy directly, or to stop somebody from hurting you by buying them out.  Downtime could be an issue, especially if you happen not to have a controlling stake in any countries.

This almost always provides a thrilling gaming experience. So much tough decisions, manipulaation, negotiations and complex strategies.

That means you can’t just focus on boosting one country like in some simpler strategy games.

Excellent luck-less economical strategy game with elements reminding of 18xx and Antike (the clever rondel mechanism). Imperial looks like a wargame, but the goal is not really conquest. As financial investor / war profiteer, your goal is to "pillage" the treasury of nations. Don't cling too much to "your" countries, but be flexible in taking over the nations where most profit can be gained (via taxation or investor). **** 12 plays have been with the investor card. 3 plays without the investor card. Slight preference to play without that card. **** Definitely play with the experienced setup!

Update: after one game with my group (3p, with investor card), we weren't exactly blown away... several of us had problems with the places where the theme breaks down, like the fact that a country which makes it high enough on the power track is always a good investment, even if it later gets totally crushed on the map.

First of all: I've played this only once and couple of rules went wrong, so this is only first impressions of mine. There are many elements than Antike has, which is big minus for me. Hopefully this isn't same kind of "optimize your game" than Antike is, so I quess this will be better one. But because I'm not fan of 1) rondel AND 2) every information is available -games, I'm sure that in the end THIS isn't game for me. But yes, ready to play it again... with right rules. :)

It's a game of complete chaos, where the countries switch players constantly. One of the most amazing loopholes is that if you don't control a country you are able to manipulate the system and buy bonds when other people can't, so some of the players once they lost their country, played specifically not to get another one. It appears that the game designers were looking to use the game to influence people inductively to see chaos as normal, and order as unusual.

This has straight up replaced Diplomacy for me.  Very similar vibe, same map, similar movement, similar potential for alliance and betrayals, half the length, wargamy aspect with central economy / euro management mechanisms thrown in.  What's not to like.  It's still too complex for casual players and too long to put on the table every night, but it's an outstanding game that scratches a specific hitch.  Diplomacy buffs will call BS on this and be right, but I still think my view is legitimate for everyone but purists.

RATING: 6
I'm not a fan of Antike, but Imperial (which also uses the Rondel of Actions mechanism) was more to my taste.  Imperial is essential a stock-market European wargame (in the vein of Diplomacy), where the companies are European nations.  The endgame feels like it's just totally a timing issue, when players are attempting to use their final Investor Card action to grab a load of cash to buy the highest value stock of the best country before someone triggers the finale (which is likely the leader - unless someone plays kingmaker).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really think the concept is fascinating but our first play was nightmarish.  Large part of that was due to the fact that we missed the part in the rules where it was written that during the taxation phase, the country recieves the points total before subtracting armies!

RATING: 8
I love the transition of country control from player to player depending on who owns the most stock.  While this can be frustrating to lose a country for which I have plans, it is also good to regain or takeover control of another player's country for a short-term or long-term goal.

Economic/Military game learning more heavily on the economic aspect.  It's a fun game that I really enjoyed but in 6 player games if people are slightly AP then the game can take 10-15 min between player turns and for the most part that's just dead time when you do nothing.

Another very interesting Euro game with a strong element of conflict.  Combat is reminiscent of Advanced Civilization in that military aggression hurts both the attacker and defender.  Although the game is primarily about economic growth and investment, the threat of combat looms over everything and makes for some tense gameplay.  I love how all of your careful planning can be undone by having a rival take control of a country in which you had held the majority.

My comments are for the version of the game played without the Investor Card, which I strongly prefer.  In the version with the card, buying opportunities are too straight-jacketed for my preferences, and money slops around too freely due to the $2m subsidy given to the cardholder every time it's activated.  I don't play this version of the game.

Imperial provides the investment and capital management experience I was hoping to find in the 18xx, but did not.  Just as 18xx is a stock game that happens to be tethered to a railroad operations game, Imperial is a stock game that happens to be tethered to a simple war game.

In both instances, what happens on the board only serves to provide imbalances and fluctuations in the value of the stocks available for purchase.

And I like the conquest game in Imperial plays better than the railroading one in 18xx.  For one thing, Imperial allows for much more aggressive and zero-sum play.  A clever token drop just can't compare to a land invasion of Britain.  But there's plenty of clever alliances possible here, too.  

Imperial is streamlined, there's very little here but game, and every decision you make is meaningful. What bookkeeping there is is quick, and easy to do.  The Rondel provides for some extremely tough decisions:  build a Factory now and invest in the future, or Manauveure and go for the offensive now?  Hit Investor to dump out quick cash, or Produce to get some much-needed devensive units?

Timing is probably the most important aspect of playing this game well.  Anyone who's had a Flag taken from them by another investor just as that country was due a big president's taxation bonus can attest to that.

If I have any gripes about this game, it's that I sometimes wish there was a little more you could do with capital and the stock market... allow players to sell bonds back, for example, perhaps with an attendant push backward on the country's power chart?  Perhaps add something akin to 18xx's train rush with weapons technology, and allow presidents to shuffle money between national treasures?  I don't know whether this stuff could be added without unduly prolonging the game... perhaps this is the makings for another game, a sucessor to Imperial.

I expect to get a lot of play out of this.  I look forward to expansion maps, both from Mac Gerdts and ones that fans may come up with.

RATING: 9
Europe in the age of imperialism before WWI.  Short playing time is a plus. A brilliant game. Each player is not a king or emperor in the game controlling a country to start fire and war but a loan-shark opportunist, who bets on winning side in a war and territorial expansion. The bond is inflated when people up and running for buying them. If a country lost the war and the treasury drained up, the bondholder would not have interest distribution from the country. You cannot, however, sell a bond you don't want. So make sure you only bet right on! 

The game design blends many facets of what was "Imperialism". Cash is king. Only greed is rewarded. Cash can control a nation government. A nasty game to some but the competitive player surely like it. It is not necessarily the military might you control wins. How to negotiate with your neighbours is also very important.

You can choose one of the 6 actions to take for your controlled nation by moving your token in the roundel space. You can build "Factory", which can produce army/ fleet for free if you choose the "Production" action. You can "Import" and deploy 3 armies for a fee (1 million, it sounds a lot but it ain't). You can "Maneuver" your units one region at a time. Sea transport can be performed with this action for moving offshore to another land area with fleet. Combat is entirely voluntary and if a war is declared, combat is resolved on a 1 to 1 army loss. Otherwise, units from different nations can coexist peacefully in an area. By spending 3 armies, you can destroy other nation's factory. You can also move your own unit within their country at will. 

You can "Invest". It happens when any one player's nation token passes through the "Investor" space on the roundel. It pays out interest to each player who owns bonds of the token. It is the moment in time everybody happy. The player holding the "investor card" receives 2 million from bank (not controlled by any player) and then use the persal money to purchase any nation bond currently available. Bond face value only goes up when the lower face value bond has been purchased by other players. But remember, you can always purchase the higher bond value if you have the sufficient money. Controlling the highest total sums of bond of a nation means that the player gets hold of the nation card denoting complete control - the player controls the nation token movement on the roundel. If a player doesn't have a nation card in hand, he can also invest once in this action. 

Finally, you can "Tax" you nation subjects...poor commoners. National taxxes are comprised of 2 mllion per factory and 1 million per tax chip. Tax chip is placed in a neutral region (and only neutral region, no tax chips can be placed in foreign nation's home provinces/ areass) the when you have the nation troop in the same. Expanding your tax base increases your power on the Taxation Chart revenue level. Extra bonus is paid when the revenue leve is increased. Of course, your armies get feed at this time as well by deduction from the revenue you get. Play continues clockwise until one player's power reaches revenue level 25 on the Taxation chart. 

Imperial is the most satisfying experience I had with the Euro games so far. It is a war of money. It gives you the insight into how Imperialism works and why war is waged. I want to buy the game and it is a good sign. I should also revisit one of the Paradox Entertainment PC game for the era to recap all the good moment. Unlike the PC game, Imperial can be finished in one day for sure. A great system and a great game indeed.

RATING: 10
I was expecting this since I played it for the first time, and, after more plays, I can safely give it a 10. Just brilliant. Before playing this game, I simply could not imagine that a game dealing with economy could be fun. Well, I guess I was incredibly wrong. This is a masterpiece from a guy who seems to never put a foot wrong - everything he designs goes straight to the top 1000. 

I must mention this is one of my most played games, behind Tigris&Euphrates only. I tried all player counts except two, playing with or without the investor card and both draft vs. bidding for the first distribution of shares and I must say I absolutely love all variations. What I find best is playing with 4-5 people and starting the game with bidding for the shares. As opposed to most people in the Investor card debate, I don't particularly prefer one over the other. They are different, but both are interesting.

I wrote a review about it that got a secondary prize at the Voice of Experience contest: [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1592916/voice-experience-imperial-gateway-heavier-drugs-su]Imperial as a gateway to heavier drugs, such as Poseidon[/url]

In gambling the only winner is the bookie

In war the only winner is the profiteer

In peace the only winner is the person who understands the tax system

If you can combine all three then you may have a good chance in Imperial. 

Solid design, often inspired.  Strong theme, clear structure and excellent use of the increasingly popular rondel combines to produce an absorbing game especially as working out tax returns only takes minutes.

Empires will rise and fall within the three hours for this game therefore it is recommended for groups of players who enjoy the long term and who have a knack for finance.

A nice change of aspect, playing the parts of the Rubber barons instead of the heads of state. Difficult choices between options in resource management makes for a variety of different approaches. The endgame troubles me: It can come very suddenly - and the best (only?) way to win is hostile takeovers of nations just before they can pay out the dividend, but the timing of this seems to be very much a question of luck

RATING: 8
I think that had I not played Indonesia first, I'd have rated this even higher, but Indonesia is more tightly integrated. With that said, Imperial is a delightful experience, requiring some thought but not overwhelmingly so, with terrific components (the money and shares both appeal to my tactile sense), and surprisingly easy to understand and play. One thing to avoid, however, is having war gamers around the table; they will cause the game to drag endlessly in pointless aggressive military moves that contribute nothing to gameplay. Also, the game is emotionally difficult to handle that first time someone takes control of "your country", so folks must be warned of this strongly in advance or their experience will be ruined.

Rating of 7 after only one play - would like to try again as played with 4 experienced players and one other newbie.  The sort of game you kind of know you are toast when playing with others (and all of them are good gamers) who have played it already.  Made one bad mistake as well in investing in the wrong country at one point.

A bit different, but not convinved it would be something that I would really enjoy playing often. It seemed a bit like you just build up your country for a few turns and then go into an "invest" tax" cycle - maybe that is a bit of groupthink and there are other ways of a winning this game.

RATING: 8
Wow. I was completely overwhelmed by my first game. I had no idea what to do but quickly grasp a few key strategies in order to secure my interest in the game towards victory. But it is far more easier to say than to do as everyone else has their own agenda. What's cool is that players do not just control a country the whole game; they act as investors and the main investor always gets to plan what his country does. However, control of the country can be changed just by investing more in the country. Would love to play this game with more players but all in all I love the possibilities that are created by different player's agendas. Very good game.

Update: With more players, I played 5 recently, the game turned out to be even better. In fact, the player who didn't have a country the majority of the game turned out to be a close second!

A Mac Gerdts rondel game.  It is a stock game, masquerading as a war game.  The game is set in Europe prior to WW I.  It is an excellent game and I cannot say enough good things about it.  The map is very tight and there is almost immediate conflict in the game.  I like this as well as Imperial 2030 and I think this one has slightly better balance issues in terms of the powers.  Although I do like some of 2030's mechanics slightly better.  Both are solid games.

Rating based on one play, but it may not get much more.  A strange breed--a stock market game with battleship meeples.  It does have an interesting mechanics of investing in countries and taking countrol by owning shares (bonds).  It gives the game an 18xx feel, although you can never liquidate your investments.  Overall, though the theme is lacking and the game suffers from Euro-blahs.  Warfare is more of a temptation or distraction than anything else.  It stays on the table about a half an hour to an hour too long to be great game.

A good extension to the Antike experience. You just have to keep in mind that the goal of the game isn't necessarily getting and keeping territory but to progress a nation across that score board and invest in the ones that are progressing.

I had this ranked a 5 after my first play.  After my second play it stayed firmly at a five.  There is simply too much chaos in what could be a very elegant game.  Both times I had the misfortune to be suicide bombed by players who seemed to think they were playing Risk.

[i]Imperial[/i] was the first big hit of 2009. That it allowed up to six to play meant it was one of the only non-party games we had available to us when all three couples showed. Amazingly enough, even with the military aspect of it, the wives took to it.  And, although the games weren't as ruthless as they could have been (invading major countries and sitting on factories was a bit taboo), the ladies had no problem taking countries over by purchasing a majority of the bonds. Nor did they have too many regrets rolling over minor countries prior to cashing in on the taxation round. The biggest problem (for me) was that the game could run just a little too long because the novices within the group would get caught up in the move/combat and not realize that they should be sprinting around the rondel to push "their" country to the x5 spot (and I wasn't going to tell them and give them the game).

RATING: 9
This is a unique game. After a couple of plays, I really think this is a great game that requires good negotiation skills, patience, and being able to adapt to changing conditions. You have to keep your eye on the goal of maximizing your investments while not becoming too dependent on any given country. 

This is a pretty cynical game....bankers running the machine of WAR without interest in any country itself.  This is a unique game.

9/2011 A very good game.  Combine a very simple war game with 18xx-ish stock and company management.  This is clearly a thought through game.  E.g. the larger bonds give less dividend, this makes it difficult for 'run away leaders'.  I guess there will be less money available with more players, and perhaps less of an arms race?

RATING: 10
First plays might feel a bit chaotic since you are so unused to the mechanism where you do play one country through out the game since you can loose control when other players are investing in it. But since that settled in your mind the struggling for maiking those countries you favour in the game becomming the most successful together with the amount of interaction is awesome. 
There are numerous strategies of making the most money (including not controlling any country) that give a high replaybility and one play seldom look lika another. The luck factor very low. 
It was the first game with the rondell mechanism for chosing actions I encoutered and I think it is outstanding and it speeds up a game that otherwise could have been to long it gaming time. Since you constantly have to keep up with what other players are doing there is not much feeling of down time.
I think the only thing that could lower my rating is when i try Imperial 2030.

This game is great. It feels a bit like an 18xx with a war element. I believe a player can not really end up without controlling any land if he/she plays reasonably well.

RATING: 7
[Played 2 times]
A mix between Antike (the "rondel" of actions, the abstract nature of conflict, the diplomacy) and 18xx (stock holding, market manipulation).
Actions are usually fast so the game doesn't drag.
Interesting. 
I wonder which version is better (with or without the Investor Card) and if/how it'll stand up to repeated plays (will we see similar decisions during each game?).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of the best games ever.  It improves upon Diplomacy by adding a moderately deeper military system with economics.  Yet it still stays simple.  And honestly, the idea of not controlling a country, but instead being an investor who can control whatever country in which they invest the most money is genius.  

This mechanic alone always keeps me on edge since it is so foreign to how I normally think, especially in games.  I constantly have to remind myself that I can ditch countries that are not doing well, or not control any countries at all, and still win.  And any game that challenges the way I think is a slam dunk in my opinion.

Play the role of an unethical investor : get rich as much as you can ; (ab)use armies to your own profit and buy shares in a clever manner.
I like the cynical theme  ; just reality ! 

Game is best without investor card ;  so you have more impact on the game
Only slightly luck dependend ; you cannot win on your own. You  have to take profit  of the (unwilling cooperation !) greed of others to win. 
Timing and choice of the share  you will  buy is crucial for winning.
+ unpredictable game in the beginnning ; every game is totally different
you have a clear start stage, middle and endgame ; just like in chess.
- game turns are a bit repetitive ; investor and taxation space are the most important actions ; other spaces on the rondel only serve as cosmetic help for your own country or to make other countries less attractive for potential investors.
- very fragile game ; if you make a mistake at game start ; it's sometimes impossible to compete anymore ; sometimes kingmaking can be a factor if someone is excluded from winning at the start of the game

RATING: 8
Stock game with an element of war in terms of area control. Some countries are better than others due to board position. Works really well with 4 players, 6 is way too much.

You can win the game without controlling any countries, but it might take the game out from most of the players as all they can do is invest and talk. When you own a country, you are in charge and responsible for other share holders. We haven't yet tried to play without the Investor card, but will definitely try with it the next time to reduce the owner swings. I really like this game and I think our group hasn't really grasped the depth of it yet.

Investment game disguised as a wargame.  Power Shifts & tidal flow over control of nations. Hurts so good...

I think I prefer the "No Investor Card" variant.  It seemed to speed up the game (greatness) & allow everyone more flexibility without diminishing the "tough choice" aspect. Update: May be changing my mind after seeing several players (myself included) get shutout early (cashflow) with little hope of catching leader(s).

My biggest disappointment so far. I really wanted to like this game, but ultimately "Imperial" delivers a "broken" feeling. If a player is left with no flag and thus cannot form a government, he becomes very powerful. So, although I have to acknowledge that a player with no government is not eliminated (as someone would expect), that player can pay no attention whatsoever of what is happening on the board and just buy the right bonds. He only have to be careful not to form a government ever again. Solution? The players must never leave another player without a flag, but then a neat aspect of the game (governments changing hands) is mitigated. So, I conclude that 3 is the right number of players because then everyone starts with 2 governments. Additionaly you must always, ALWAYS, play without the investor card.
Another thing I dislike is how the "Investor" and "Taxation" options are abused at the end of the game. 
In conclusion, when I have to play a game only in a certain way in order to be playable and enjoyable and I can manipulate the mechanics (and not the theme) of a game in order to win, I consider this game defective.
Furthermore, this is not a wargame (that's not necessarily bad). It is a mediocre economic game.

Lots to like here.  Shifting "directorship" of Pre-WWI "Great Powers" based on how much players have "invested" in them is entertainingly amoral.  Buy a government, wreak profitable havoc, milk the treasury, repeat...  Great fun, lots of strategic options, plays relatively simply once everyone has seen how each of the actions on the rondel work.

Still haven't played the "no investor card" variant, nor have I played where players choose their starting holdings rather than having them assigned.  Need to try both of those soon.

Strange mix of mechanics that work, but fall somewhat flat in the fun department.  In my one play, it appeared to me that the winner was determined based on who was able to go last.

A game where you buy stock in pre-WWI nations. With ownership you buy guns, expand, and tax to increase the nations wealth. The game is NOT area control, but instead who ever has the most stock values in nations that are doing well at the end wins. It allows you to buy into the wining nation.

RATING: 7
Flavor-wise, it's strange that each of these Great Powers tax their people and pay (usury level) interest so irregularly, and on the whim of a single investor. It's as if the only people with a will of their own are the players. Also, the art looks awkward. Other than that, it's business as usual.

The stock system provides for some natural alliances that last throughout the game, which makes it more complex and interesting than a simple hit-and-run backstabathon. Sometimes it has a tendency toward locking some people out for extended periods and making it difficult to catch up.

Overall, a solid, if long, game.

5 / 5 - Great 

There's quite a staggering amount going on here in terms of aspects of strategy to analyze. so much so that it prevents over-analysis and AP by pushing players out of the other side. The combination of economic management on diplomacy style unit maneuvering is unusual, interesting and cleverly integrated, although it should be noted that the economic side of the game is primary. The turn order that results from the bid-for-countries mechanic can sometimes lead to periods of downtime for one or two players.

I played this game only once and I was very satisfied.

In a nutshell, it's Diplomacy but you don't control the states: you control the fat cats who fund the states. These greedy capitalists treat entire nations like companies whose shares can be bought in the stock exchange.

Who pays the piper calls the tune and who owns the bonds sets the policy. These avid oligarchs get filthy rich by investing in the right nation in the right moment and/or having the states they control prevail over the others.

I find it amazing that this game is ranked so highly.  It is an interesting theme.  Players are arms merchants for the Great Powers before WW1 and use the governments as proxies for their purposes.  It seems to be an abstraction of Diplomacy with an extra feature - the ability to flip control of a government.  The problem I have with the game is that it lacks the grace of Diplomacy.  The sweeping attacks, the support (and betrayal), and the simultaneous movement.  I think it is a fine game - just not what I wanted or hoped for.  I've played three times now and each game has been close (no arguments about the balance - it is balanced) and there are good Machiavellian moments.  Still, I wish the movement rules were more like Diplomacy.  Fleets in this game are certainly not as effective.  Oh well. Rant over.

It plays wonderfully and feels like it really moves long despite the long-for-me play time.  Yet it suffers for me the same as most heavily stock-based games - I just have a hard time with them.  Any time a game involves investing in stocks, it's difficult for me to wrap my head around.  Still, I would gladly play again.

One playing. Didn't like how investors could buy late into a stock and still reap big rewards (and I'd like to have been able to sell shares to make things more dynamic). Military part of game seemed largely like a red herring (eg time waster) to the "real" game. End game was a disappointment of calculations. Might try again, but not hopeful. 

 edit: raised rating a notch. Still not crazy about the game, but I have to admit I enjoyed it more than last time.

Tenuous - likely to be removed as it's not the winner of its niche for me, and that niche is overcrowded and this I can play elsewhere anyhow.

Nice - only one play, and with the investor card at that - still I liked it and it really showed the ropes of how the game worked. No clue as to strategy - but there appears to be quite a lot of it - setting up incentives / forks and coming out on top is a really interesting challenge. The rondel adds a layer to it for sure - but I found that the slightly less interesting mechanic (except for its role in setting the game tempo with the investor card)

1 play. I really enjoyed even though we only played it two-player and we botched the rules. I want to play with 4 or 5.

UPDATE: It's OK as a 5-player game. I think I'd prefer to play it with 4, maybe 3 if desperate. 

Also, get rid of the investor card. I thought it would be a good thing for a beginner game, and all it did is throw the end of the game drastically. It might be possible to use the card as a way to infuse 2 million a turn into the economy, but other than that, meh!

RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell: Players control nations by the purse strings then send them to war in order to profit.

Played as: 6 player

Pros: Very nice blend of war and euro games. I really get a sense that I'm running a country by either building it up or rather paying out to my cronies as it falls into the pits. The rules are pretty smooth, with very few niggly details. Ripe for diplomacy if you'd like some viciousness. Overall, just a very thematic game.

Cons: I don't love how you can sit around not controlling a nation for often huge chunks of time. It's like being eliminated from the game only you can't get up and start another game because the design wants you to sit and hope for the chance to jump back in. I ask myself if player elimination wouldn't have been more merciful. The rondel, while a neat mechanic, just makes little thematic sense in a thematically heavy game. 

Other: So I botched a couple rules in my only play that lengthened the game and stripped out a couple key elements, but still found it very interesting and immediately would have played again (and that's with not yet realizing the errors). That has to count for something. I'd think the game would be better with a mid-range of players where competition is high but there's enough countries that you're less likely to be eliminated early.

Best Use: There's not a lot of multi-player heavier weight Wa-euros out there. This gets high honors in that category.

Wow, did this game last too long.  A very nice mechanism of changing control but the firt half is a long setup, and the second was so static, when novody dared building an army because it would set you too far behind.  A total game/theme mismatch: makes no sense at all what we represent.

There are so many layers to this game that I don't think I can properly review it. It is funny how aggressive you can get in this game and when you step back you realize just how awful the character you are playing is. This is corporatism: the board game. You are depleting the national treasuries just to line your pockets and leaving the innocent civilians to suffer. It's great.

RATING: 8
Excellent & elegant stock game where players own stock in countries and take the actions for the countries they own the majority of stock in.  The actions are selected from the (Antike) rondelle.  As countries are built up their stock produces larger dividends and their end-game multiplier improves.  I think this may have a lot of depth and replayability.  UPDATE: knocked rating down 1/2 a point... there may be some control issues with the timing of the investor card, especially with the end game.  Something to be aware of so you can try to plan for it.  The "expert" setup where players take turns buying bonds to begin with is the way to go.

The heaviest of Gerdts' rondel games.  The first time played has to be a learning experience -- between the economics of buying bonds and maneuvering units to increase your advantage/deny others, there's much going on.  A very great, longish, engrossing game.  This doesn't stop me from enjoying the game while playing!

Initially I was suspicious - a war game? With no dice? How am I going to win without luck to balance out my inability to figure out good strategies? Surprisingly all became clear relatively soon in a game which neatly depicts just how filthy capitalists exploit everything in the pursuit profit, profit and even more profit. I was quite happy to rake in the money myself mind you. Send the men off to die before we have to pay them so that the country has more in the treasury to pay out the share dividends. Lovely. My opinion of this has waned with additional plays, I am unable to compute the required strategies.

It's funny, our first game or two of Imperial was played with the quick set up (6 players) and we played it almost like a strict war/diplomacy game. Since then, we've elected to use the open set up and the game has become much, much more dynamic. There's still plenty of alliances and conflict, but it's been really interesting to see how much more interconnected everyone becomes and how much you have to consider how your actions could benefit the other players even if they benefit you a little more. Ace game, dead easy to set up and teach. My wife loves it and says "this is the war game for me."

Enjoyed the first play, but not sure about the "I have 2 and you have 1 so I win" mechanic - much too simplistic for me. I'm not a huge fan of the rondel either - it serves its purpose, but to say it's an amazing invention - nah!

My 4th play:
Played it now for the first time WITH the investor card and I just have to upgrade my rating to a 10. The ownership of a country switches now more often what makes the game super fun. And I "get" it now. The game design is amazing: elegant and very intellegent. Even the bond distribution has a reason.

12 plays: okay I dont really get it with only 1 win. But this game is still a 10.

RATING: 7
My best description would be economic Diplomacy, in that players can buy controlling shares in countries out from under each other.

It took some time to grok that I was NOT the country I was playing but an investor, and I did feel like there was a bit of a runaway leader problem in the game. I can see that if all players do not play optimally (and the player who I was paired with due to having shares in the same countries was NOT playing optimally) than it can create some game balance issues. Still, the entire game was an absolute blast - very tense, and engrossing.

In the end, however, I still feel like I have a similar experience with Chicago Express, in about 1/4th of the time, and there is less chaos to manage in CE.

The game is excruciatingly long with players who think it's a wargame with money. It becomes fairly quick but tedious with players who think it's just about the cash. Then it becomes long again with players who realize the primacy of cash but try to eke out little advantages here and there through the wargame aspect. At this point some veterans claim the game transforms into a "negotiation" game. Fair enough.

Despite my lack of excitement, I remain intrigued enough by this title to want to play it every once in a while.

I think I prefer this board to [boardgame=54138][/boardgame]'s, as it gives each country a more distinct feel and forces more confrontational play.

Only 1 play.  I can't say that I loved it but I definitely found it interesting.  It's so different from anything else I can think of.  I have to admit that I really want to give this another try.  I can tell that there is a really good game in there.  Not sure yet if that means it's for me but a game with enough depth that I don't know what to think of it after the first game is what I would call a good game.  Either there is too much chaos and grasping strategy will always be difficult or, as I suspect, there's a lot more to be discovered.

RATING: 7.7
A really good strategic game where players take the place of capitalists trying to profit from war (WWI in this case). Quite a novel concept as most conflict games have the players run sides/nations/factions/whatever. In Imperial you can change country several times, the only thing that matters is the wealth your investments generate.

Very enjoyable to play with good production values.

I like this game. Nice and tight, with any subtle movements. I need more play to assess balance issues. It's easy to follow strong players, while avoiding weaker players when flags are owned. Being a flagless player is interesting and tricky. Power yet at the whims and quality of the flag owners.  I see room for many different paths of strategy, should have a long lifespan. Added: Played with the no investor card rule, and I must say, I don't think i'd play anyway else. Game is getting better the more I play it.

As others have commented, Imperial takes elements of 18xx share buying on top of Diplomacy's map and easy conflict rules. The result is a very satisfying and strategic game. The best way to play the game is the advanced setup with no investor card.

RATING: 9
An excellent mixture between 18xx, Diplomacy and Antike.

I don't see any disadvantages to lose your last government. You can watch the game for further investments and advice the government you have invested in. You are not out of the game. Quite the contrary, you have time to plan the next move.

If you are looking for a more-complex version of Risk or a economic version of Diplomacy or a battle version or Acquire, then keep on stepping.  Although this game has attributes of each of those games, it is very unique to itself.

8.5 after 1 four-player game. There are so many things to keep an eye on in this game, and a winning strategy is not apparent on the first play. Like the 18xx series, this is really two intersecting games in one. If you like Antike and the 18xx style games then you should enjoy Imperial. The rules are relatively simple, but they need re-writing to remove errors and clarify some of the finer points about combat and investing. I'm hoping to get this on the table again sometime soon and using the variant without the investor card (because it gives to much of an advantage to the player who avoids control of a nation). I'm expecting my score to go up to 9  after a few more plays.

Too typical of a Eurogame. Strategy can be formed and follow-through from the beginning, Easily exploited and still arguably as "part of pre-planned strategy". Once you are in control of 2 nearby countries, initiate attack from each other, then rotate gaining control of each other territory for fastest cash .. thus enabling that player to buy the most expensive bond for that country and secure his own victory. Very lame.

I like this game a lot.  The fact that you don't identify with a nation, but merely control the nation you are the majority shareholder in, makes for a change in mindset.  It's all about maximizing your investment in the most succesfull nations.  This in not a wargame, although we had our share of battles.  The battlesystem is just a bit too abstract and simplistic to be appropriate for a wargame.  Due to the potential of changing ownership of nations, it's also very difficult to make any diplomatic alliences with other players.  All in all, a good game, that requires to get your mind out of the traditional mindset you would have in games like Diplomacy, Game of Thrones and the likes.  The expert variant, and playing without the investor card seem good advice.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Previously I often played conflict games, and I still appreciate their strategic and diplomatic turns, but lately I've moved on to economic games, where plain rate of return rather than (un-)faithfulness against allies dictate the dynamics. Imperial is a game that appeals both to generals and businessmen. At the surface, it's a war between military organizations and production machineries where whoever can bring armies and fleets at the right time to the right place wins. But beneath this surface the true game hides: capitalists that unscrupulously support and abandon the nations depending on the expected return of the war.

The players invest money in nations that those in turn spend on factories to produce armies and fleets with the purpose of conquering territories. Success on the battle field means more tax to the nation and higher value to the investor. The actions are chosen through a simple but elegant rondel mechanism where every action is important to build the war economy but also delays the for the victory important tax action.

This mechanism would have been enough for a "normal" conflict game but the greatness of Imperial is the fact that the nations constantly change owners. Is a nation doing well? Invest in it for a takeover to reap the rewards yourself. Is a nation doing badly? Use it as battering ram to further other nations and abandon it. All is fair in war and business.

Imperial reminds a bit about the 18XX games with its shareholder economy and total lack of randomness but has a better flow in the game thanks to simpler rules and short but meaningful turns. The players may not be able to dump nations on each other but this is compensated by the shifting alliances on the board as the ownerships are changing. The result is a swingy game but not unpredictable if you understand the connection between the players' motives and the game's mechanisms. Imperial is simply a game where the players drive the game instead of the other way around, just like it should be in a good game. To fully understand this connection is another issue...

Excellent game.  It really keeps your mind working while not bogging down.  I rate Antike (by the same designer) a little higher because it is more newbie friendly and a bit more of a crowd pleaser than Imperial, the theme of which has a slightly more cynical bent that leaves some cold.  Purely a matter of personal taste (I like the theme), but finding enthusiastic players is definitely an important consideration when rating a game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In 19th century Europe, on a map similar to Diplomacy, there are a number of bonds associated with the 6 countries on the map: Austria-Hungary, Italy, France, England, Germany and Russia. Players controlling the most bonds of a country take actions for the country by moving along a circular rondel. The actions are: raise armies/navies, move units, tax the country and invest in the country. In the basic game, there is an investor card that rotates clockwise and allows the holder to buy bonds in any country. In the advanced game, once a country has finished the turn, anyone can buy bonds in that country. The bonds acts as victory point multipliers, ranging from 1 to 5, depending how far the country has advanced in power points. Designed by Mac Gerdts, the system is similar to his previous game, Antike. This is a wargame, so it will not be for everyone. Sometimes nations get attacked without much provocation. Also the nations start in a particular order (Austria, then Italy moves, etc.) This can mean some players will be short a turn. I think being a wargame, this game relies on players to balance the game. 

Now, too be good at this game, you have to treat the countries like a stock market and invest in the one that looks like it will succeed. I'm not very good at this, I tend to get drawn into the tactical aspects, and I'm not that good at it either! It has some interesting concepts, but it is a bit long, and it's not my type of game.

I love the simplicity of this game!  So easy to present but it provides a great strategic experience.  My only quibble is that I in no way feel like a WWI investor during gameplay...some thematic elements might help this game reach the typical American audience (my gaming group is not as Euro friendly as I am).

Not as similar to Antike as it looks.  Imperial is a more intricate game with a more obvious victory condition and fewer five-second turns.  I like it immensely and suspect it will hit the table many times, but it doesn't rank quite as high as Antike, which has a more appealing theme and is easier to explain.

Really enjoyed this game.  Interesting mechanic allows all 6 Great Nations to be in the game regardless of the number of players.  Love the theme, and really like the idea of buying out other nations that seem to be doing very well.  No down time between turns, and the investor mechanic is another fun and interesting development.  Can't wait to try this one again.

Wonderful game. It is often compared to Antique because they have similar basic mechanics, but they are very different games. BOTH OF THEM are top games in my opinion. Imperial has the advantage, for me, that is probably more enjoyable with only three players. Very recommended!

Fascinating brain-burning stock speculation game where the stocks are actually countries at war with one another, and the largest share holder determines how that war progresses.  Want to play more.

--update--
This one takes a big hit because of the boring-yet-dominating strategy of not controlling any country and scooping up more stocks than anyone else.

It is not easy to keep in mind that your ultimate goal is not waging war, but earning money. A match of Imperial frequently takes numerous turns and the control of the powers changes hands sometimes quite unexpectedly. You really have to stick to your agenda in order to win, but the ongoing wars are somwhat distracting. A really good game, which is sufficiently easy to play so that my kids enjoy it as well, but on the other hand sufficiently complex to manage, to challange even old school gamers.

RATING: 8
Excellent game, and lots of fun to play, makes for a very fluid, nasty, competitive  game with alliances being made and broken as fast as you can say 'no its not diplomacy'. Some players didn't get it too well though , and got obsessed about looking after one empire.

RATING: 7
Much better without the investor card, since everyone can invest in a country right after the country's current majority shareholder player took action starting with the majority shareholder. This gives more control over retaining the majority in that country. Developing the board is unfortunately very slow, so this game takes at least 3 hours. Would not play this with more than 4.

RATING: 8
I really like the overall feel of this game. You're not really trying to get one country to dominate the area, you just want to have some interest in the top countries. Sometimes you might just want to use a country to gain money and not worry that much about its board position.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Imperial is an excellent game for 4-5 players. I thought previously that 5 or 6 players might not be as good experience since you have less control over game and could spend time without country to play with. I really like changing ownership of countries as a mechanic. There is a good amount of tension and interesting decisions throughout the game. Always a pleasure to play. I like it most with 4 players, 5 player game being my next best option. Should try with 6 experienced players to test how it feels. Although I liked my two games with 3 players, I'd play with more players if possible. 

I prefer playing with investor card with 3-4 players. Haven't tried without it with 5-6. With six investor investor card moves quite slowly around table so without might be the right move. Although I have never played Imperial with 6 players. I'm not sure which way to go with five. Haven't tried without and only played couple of games with 5 anyway. There I'd like to try investorless sometime to make my mind about it.

Update (18.4.2008): Tried recently a game with 5 players. It was still a very good experience but there was more moments when someone didn't have any country to control. They didn't seem to like it and I generally don't like idea to be without country during mid-game. I think the game is at it's best with 4 players.

Update (29.5.2008): Another game with 5 players is making me think that Imperial actually is a very good with 5 players also.

Update (13.9.2008): Imperial is close to a 10 game but not quite there. Hard to say really what it is lacking. There is right amount of tension and playing is fun. You need to play correctly strategically and tactically to be able to win. I'll rise my rating from 9 to 9.5. And since I don't like fractions too much that rounds up to a 10. :-) Imperial is clearly a superb game and I love to play it whenever I got the chance.

Engaging theme, fantastic mechanics and nice components! This game is a superb combination of economy, diplomacy and war. However, this is a stock market game. Do not let the war aspect fool you or you will lose. There are plenty of room for strategies and tactics in this game. The more I play (and I have played a lot but have not logged my earliest plays) the better it gets. This is the best euro type game that I have played!

I really like the basic concept that players invest on different countries as grey eminences, developing their industries, collecting taxes and even making them bankrupt or driving them into war. A great game.

RATING: 9
Quickly becoming one of my favourite games.  Excellent all around if not a little to short.  Play without the investor card for a much more "fair" game.

This game NEEDS 5 or 6 to be enjoyable. With less, the chance of a non-competitive country is just too high, meaning its neighbours will enjoy too easy of a conquest.

RATING: 8
A strange but engaging strategy game.  This is not an empire building game. It is an economic game with a Diplomacy style theme. Control of nations moves between players depending on who holds the most bonds, which can initially make it hard to implement a strategy. Once players realise that they shouldn't get too attached to the well-being of a particular nation the game starts to flow and strategies can be formed. Sometimes a player can have little to do except wait for a chance to invest and hopefully take control of a nation. It's a very enjoyable game, which has greatly improved as players have become more experienced. (7)

Interesting game. You don't necessarily have to be in control to win the game, but you do have to invest in the countries that ultimately will pay out a high return. A little more complex than Antike, because you have to manage your interests across multiple countries, not just one.

An alternative view of WWI and of wars in general. Very interesting and original. As usual, I do not appreciate the "attack him, not me pleeease" effect, which however here is mitigated by the common ownership of countries.
Another aspect which I do not like is the ping-pong effect when a player owns two bordering countries.

A shares game relating to countries in WW1.  Brilliant.  I love the bonds mechanic and how no country is yours and your motivation is profit.  Buying into a country to bleed it of all its money and then use that money on the country you think has positioned itself for the next payout is something I really love.  

The only downside is that its possible for players to be bought out and have no country's and not be able to do much for large amounts of the game.  I have been in this position and its not good, but I think with equally experienced players this shouldn't happen.

I just like everything about this game.  Hard to come up with a winning strategy as the game plays out differently each time.  Scales great between 4 and 6 players.  Two main variants, not using investor card and starting the game with an auction for starting countries both rock.  Good interaction between players, you must watch where everyone else is on the rondel and what they're doing on the board. 

After further plays, this one has staying power to boot!  It could become my all time favorite game.

A no-luck game, a true thinker. My first impression was rather negative, but I'd definitely give it a second chance.

*重點2 小股票其實CP值很高。未必須要搶國家控制權，主要是看買之後賺的比例，最後期蠻好算的
*不能隨時買股票其實蠻卡的，真的要規劃的好點
規則:
*長柱放右上行動輪中央，短柱放下方分數軌0，跟右上稅務軌2-5，每個國家起始在其方格城市放一間工廠，放對應顏色，債券根據國家分類，數字小的在上面，放對應位置

*遊戲輪流由國家行動(奧地利>義大利>法國>英國>德國>俄國)，每次行動最多長柱移動6格(起始隨意格)，超過3格的每格要付兩圓，遊戲在一國分數超過25時結束，玩家加總現金跟債券利率乘上該國力量參數的錢，平手比擁有最高分國家債券總額，依序比下去
*如果有國家一開始沒人有該國國旗卡，則行動跳過，起始投資卡給奧地利控制國家玩家的左手玩家，否則給義大利左手邊玩家
*玩家錢跟國家錢分開，但是玩家錢可用來幫國家支付，國家錢公開，玩家錢隱藏
>工廠 付五圓蓋一棟在沒有敵兵的對應顏色城市地點上
>生產 每個工廠沒敵兵的免費產1兵(棕)或1船(藍)
>進口 花一元買一兵/船放到沒有敵兵的自己城市，最多三個，可重複放，船只能放港口
>行軍 所有船先可移動一格(港口到相鄰海域算一格)，之後移動步兵一格(瑞士不能進去)，過海要有船，每艘船可傳一隻>放一個國家旗子在最後佔領沒有其他國單位的頂土或海洋上
*步兵在自己的家園五格內可自由移動通過沒有敵兵的領土不算格數
*步兵跟船，移動到有其他國家單位的地方時任何一方可選擇開戰，一換一換掉，只有在行軍時可選擇開戰即使不移動，步兵如果到其他國家領土但是選擇倒下則不算敵兵，一個國家剩最後一個工廠沒有敵兵時，就不能再被占領，三個步兵可換掉一個工廠(要沒有守軍，最後一個一樣不能拆)
*船在港口時可以跟兵開戰
>投資  每個有國家債券的玩家從該國家拿對應金錢(如果不夠付，有該國國旗的人不少拿，在不夠有該玩家支付)>有投資卡玩家獲得兩圓並可以買一張債券，可買新的或升級舊的，之後投資可左傳(升級付差值)>有瑞士銀行卡但沒有投資卡的也可買一次(多人時照順位，從有投資卡的開始)，之後決定誰有哪張國家卡，加總債券卡利息，多的拿，平手順位靠近投資卡玩家的拿，沒國家的一樣拿瑞士銀行卡
*如果行動轉盤經過投資不停，則先結算最後停的行動，之後再結算投資付債券以外的行動
*有瑞士銀行卡的玩家可強迫其他玩家停留在投資行動，前提時該玩家夠錢付利息
>收稅 每個沒敵兵工廠兩圓，領土旗子一圓，記錄在稅務軌，超過15放15，如果新的值比之前高，超過多少該國家卡擁有者拿多少錢(變少不扣錢)>根據稅務軌右邊數字增加該國的分數軌>之後稅務值扣除場上兵數，該國家拿對應金錢，負的就不拿

Excellent game. Despite none of it's ingredients being new or innovative (Rondel, Fighting, Stock Holding have all been done before), they are blended together in a unique way here in Gerdts' second Waro.

It plays in about 2 hours, which is perfect for its weight. I can't decide if I like this or Antike best.

Edit: Jun 2010 - Antike is better. Imperial is too similar each time.

Edit: May 2011 - Antike is too similar each time, Imperial is better.

Bit of a surprise this one. 'By the guy who did Antike', so initially just thought it was a similar game but in Europe. Bought it based on that, it turned out to be a much much better game.

RATING: 7
The rondel of actions forces each of the 6 countries through cycles of troop expansions, deployment and payouts. The gameplay is to determine which countries are going to be safest from attack (because the players invested in that country control neighbouring countries) and then invest in it as much as you can because it can cycle to the payout phase quicker rather than having to spend turns defending. The other aim is to build semi-alliances with other players - having multiple investors in a country you control diminishes the chances of it being attacked. There are good decisions to be had when choosing the next rondel action for a country. It's dullsville when you don't have a country. As a result, the game might shine with experienced players, but it's a harsh beast for those players who fail to develop a controlling interest or fail to build helpful alliances. The end of game scoring can also be harsh when being just 1 turn slow can make a big difference in the multiplier you receive. It's a game I respect, but not one I overly enjoy due to its harshness and over-reliance on reading alliances well.

RATING: 6
I've played this twice now, both times the game seemed a little broken. The first time because we broke it, the second because we had a player who had no control of a country and his ability to continuously invest gave him the game. Now, having looked into it, it's because there was a missing fix - the 'No Investor Card Rule', and typically BGG was down the one time it could have made a difference in a game I was playing. Still I want to work out which is the 'Non Broken Variant' and try it one last time before I pass judgement. At this stage I want to like this game a great deal more than I actually do.

Well next time - it is No Investor Card or NOTHING!

UPDATE: Played 6 player tonight with no investor card. I think this game gets one more chance, and that would be as a 4 player. I want to like this a whole tonne more than I do... But I just don't think it's that fun in the end. In tonight's game I managed a respectable score, but only because I bought a share right near the end, which luck and only a moderate bit of planning managed to gain me.

With hindsight I think playing this 6 player is a mistake. Looking forward to trying it with 4 players.

Ho sottovalutato Imperial: la brutta grafica e la durata sopra la media hanno fatto sì che la prima partita avvenisse a un anno dal suo acquisto. Ed è un peccato, perche è un gran gioco. Gerds prende un tema trito e ritrito e lo rende originalissimo. La prima cosa da fare è non affezionarsi alla nazione che si sta guidando, e tenere sempre a mente che non sei un patriota, ma un lobbista: invece di sconfiggere la nazione confinante puoi controllarla politicamente, o puoi soffiare il controllo del ricco stato più vicino poco prima che sia l'ora di tassare, o puoi saltare sul carro del vincitore acquisendo bond dello stato più vicino alla vittoria. E poi un sacco di interazione, buone idee (prima di tutti, i fondi statali) e la ruota delle azioni (già vista in Antike e Hamburgum) mai così azzeccata. Poteva diventare una versione senza dadi di Risiko Più, fortunatamente ciò non è avvenuto.

Start rounds & end rounds are robotic. Challenging, but you feel lost sometimes & that can make it seem dull.  I suspect with experience this feeling lessens.

Rating is based on using the no investor card variant and the experienced players setup.

Excellent. The movement and combat resemble Diplomacy, but it's about making smart investments rather than area control. Many people become too attached to countries they control and stumble into making errors like waging wars of attrition instead of making money. To win, players must correctly assess which countries will be profitable and invest in them. Controlling or at least predicting when the game will end is also important. No luck and very little downtime.  

A lot of playtesting and development went into this game, and it shows. The rulebook is clear and the rules are simple but the gameplay is deep.

I have to adore this game despite all its politically-incorrect glory.  Maybe it's the math-y part of keeping track of investments while having to run a game of pseudo-Risk on the side and planning everything against what you think your opponents might do, but I find this game as absorbing as any I have played.  I particularly like the asymmetry of the fact that you and your opponents all have a constantly-changing set of common and conflicting interests.

A great game with competitive people. Reminds me somewhat of Diplomacy, although with less quirky movement/combat rules. Imperial also offers more options and a more varied game play, still the meta game diplomacy talk will occur quite frequently in Imperial too. It is just more of an open and teasing discussion around the table - more natural and less constructed than in Diplomacy. 

Love the artwork. I have only played with the "no Investor card" variant.

The gaming time was longer than I expected. The system needs a while to get used to: no more you have your own country which you defend. Now anyone can have any country to his/her control with sufficient money investment. Moves can be rather surprising with that element...

Well, the game went on in an ok pace but with investor-phase, we had a problem: thinking which share to buy... then it gets tricky. You first have to calculate your money and then the remaining shares and then check the situation between countries and revise the rules and check the situation again... For a first-time player, the movement of money from countries to players can be quite a mess. It gets better during the game, but at first, it's a shock.

It was surprising that there are basically no fight for the countries' color-coded areas, only sea-areas and neutral landscapes. It was a nice addition, since now there was no use turtling too much.

Downtime was sometimes too much. I contributed to downtime also as much as anyone else but still.. I'd prefer a shorter version of this all, since I really liked the basic system in this. Rondel fits also to this game like a nose to a gas mask!

Have just played twice and think it's a very fun game.  But, the MINIMUM time for 3 - 4 players is about 5 hours.  Advice to novices: it's an ECONOMIC game, not a war game, so don't just make war with others.  Excellent blend of Risk and Diplomacy where the catch is that you don't run a country, you invest in a country, and once you become majority stock holder in a country you get to run it.  Which means countries change hands throughout the game.  Brilliant design and fun game.

A very fine game, which is like Antike, but with a much smoother endgame, with more interesting twists and turns to it.  Conflict is not as devastating to one's plans as in Antike, and actually provides benefits.  A few mechanics and strategies take several turns to begin making sense.  Fun and tense, but I like the theme of Antike a bit more.

supercool quasi-wargame.  wallenstein meets diplomacy meets 1830.  seems to have a lot to do with tempo -- running up a country to make serious dough, then investing it in the ones that become worth the most victory points.  the design is about lots of things working together correctly.

I've still only got about four plays of this in, but I'm starting to see the possibilities of this game. Our game group is still trying to get the game down to the 120-150 minute zone which I'm guessing is when the time:fun ratio would be about right.

Still enjoying this, but play times remain long which keep it off the table.

RATING: 9
Mediocre instructions and an intimidating learning curve made it difficult to play this game. Plus the the theme was a hard sell and met with little enthusiasm. After a year of collecting dust and waiting for the right moment it finally paid off. A very interesting strategy game that is very different from other games. I found that the only unfortunate element is that players cannot ditch their worthless stock in exchange for a fraction of their investment. However, I did learn to appreciate this game very much.

RATING: N/A
Inaugural game was a two-player affair.  It took a long time, and ended prematurely.  I enjoyed it quite a bit, and would love to try it with more players.  The two player game provides a lot of control and a kind of clear situation as to what player owns or controls what country.  To that degree it felt a bit like Risk - with war and combat being the order of the day.. But with 4 to 6 players I can imagine that war and combat takes a back seat to cautious investing, and for that reason I can't wait to try it with more players - or two players, again.  If I were to rate it after one play (which I don't) it'd be an 8 or a 9.

Really tight. Too bad the game is pretty much over after 1/3 of game. Most of the money is made then and the rest is commodity specualation with a snowball effect. Good game, still.

--> 7.5 still too tricky and really sore for the losers. (I've won my two previous games)

RATING: 8
3 or 4 players only. The total number of investor card's rotations doesn't depend on the number of players. So, with more players, you receive the investor card less often. With 5 players, you don't receive the card often enough: only 5 times, maybe only 4 times. And with 6 players, only 3 times for some players, 4 times for the luckiest.

4 joueurs : 125 + 149 + 182 + 153 = 609

Great mix of a wargame and an economic contest. Beautiful wooden pieces. Very combative, but no country can be eliminated and it's cool to watch control of a country and suddenly switch from one player to another. Can be a bit annoying if you don't control any countries and have difficulty getting enough money to buy back into the game again.

Edit: A bit long for what it is. The rondel does cause the same sequence of actions to happen over and over.

I have enjoyed this game more each time I've played it.  The first game was absolutely horrible.  We could not figure out how to progress scores, we just battled a lot and it lasted around 10 hours.  Second game was a reasonable amount of time and sort of fun, at least I didn't think it was a totally broken game anymore.  Third play we found an important rule we missed: water areas are taxable!!  This more than doubles the amount of taxable spaces, no wonder we had trouble at first!  Really cool game, I look forward to getting this to the table again.

This is a very unique board game. I love the way that countries change hands, and how that affects how you plan ahead. I've learned a lot about strategy having played twice now. Controlling stake is good, but if you can afford it, it is way better to buy a new bond over upgrading. Anyway, very interesting mechanics, very elegantly designed, with a few things that are a little out of place. But mostly, the game is great.

[ORIGINAL FROM 2009]

This is the game of choice for my friends who usually play nothing but Risk or videogames.  It's simplicity and depth lead me to recommend this one to any boardgamer, for any occasion.

[UPDATE 10-25-14 / SCORE UPPED FROM 8 TO 10]

A lot of games in my collection have come and gone in the last 5 years, but this one has never ever crossed my mind as being unnecessary.  I always enjoy playing it, my friends always get screwed over by my milking bone dry of countries like a swarm of locusts, and I very rarely lose.  It's stock market gambling, diplomacy and poker all rolled up into one!  What's not to love!?

It's as though it wasn't playtested enough, and as they couldn't work out a rule set that worked well, they said you can play it this way, or this way, or this way, and by the way here's a bunch of optional rules for you to try. Also too long for what it's trying to be.

RATING: 7
One 3-player and one 6-player with Investor card. Plays quickly even with 6 players. Keep control of at least one country and try to pay out early when you have dominant control. Avoid fighting on any more fronts than absolutely necessary. Some areas just 'belong' to a country, moving in will likely produce a protacted counter-productive war. A player that doesn't understand this will likely drag down both himself and his unlucky neighbor. Early less-than-optimal play will assure a less than stellar finish. Understanding comes quickly but lost opportunities early can't be made up.

A rich game with a lot going on, and a lot to think about. Very much like the two tier game play. The countries jockeying for position and strength, the players trying to own interest in the successful countries. I can see much of the game revolving on how to manage the various action of the countries on the roundel. 
Definitely has a lot of replay value.

I like how players buy stocks to take over countries and the countries themselves take turns, not the players.  Players can then use the country to make money, fight wars or both.

It's hard for me to really enjoy this game since getting the hang of how to channel money into your coffers is not obvious and early mistakes can result in a long and tedious game.

It is a very decent game.  It has a little Diplomacy (the game) in it.  Some economics.  Some Euro.  There are some good things that you get to do.  It ends abruptly, but aren't we used to that with this type of game.  It has a little of that too much luck in the end to win thing even though there is absolutely NO luck, except for how you start out.  But the other players add the randomness.

One play, six player game, no investor card variant. I did not control a company for the ENTIRE game and I finished in third place. I managed to read the rules for three games (other than Imperial) while playing.


Money flow is way too tight with players without a country to control, especially you are holding bonds in a country that is not paying out any dividends because the controlling player is skipping the investor space to jump to production all the time.


If I do end up playing this game, I will insist that (a) no more than four players should play and (b) the investor card be used.

High production values (though I wish the pieces were just a bit smaller--the factories, in particular, seem uneccessarily large). An excellent game. I had no problem with the investor card. It moved around the table fine, even with 6. Interesting, and cynical, take on the history of international finance--the "money" behind the throne. Play this and War on Terror back to back and you'll start wearing tin foil hats and think the CIA controls your thoughts. And, yes, use poker chips for the treasuries.

The upside:

- Diplomacy, intrigue, building armies, manouever them and all that with 0 luck. Brilliant!

The downside:
- It's tricky to understand and explain how do win.

According to Lenin the highest form of capitalism is Imperialism - the stage wherein the pursuit of capital transcends national borders and creates geopolitical conflict through the exploitation of militant Nations to conquer and tax other nations. 
With the rise of Imperialism, world wars become marketing vehicles for Nations to show off their power and convince international investors to buy war bonds.

Through relatively simple mechanics, Imperial is able to deliver to us an amazingly nuanced (and fun!) first-hand demonstration of Lenin's philosophy.
Honestly, regardless of if the real world implications curdle your blood or not, Imperial ought to be taught in every school.

RATING: 2
This is a stock market game with a wargame pasted on, and neither the stock market game nor the wargame are any good.  It amounts to hours of pointless fiddling around with bits that have essentially no overall impact on the value of the stocks, and a sudden final result that, despite being entirely deterministic, is essentially a purely random result of chaos. I played it twice, bored stiff both times. The first, I finished dead last after spending most of the game unable to do anything: "No, I can't do anything; I don't have any money and don't control any of the countries so I have no way to get any." The second, I [i]won[/i] by a significant margin, after spending most of the game unable to do anything. (There were several times I could see that I wouldn't need to [i]look at the board[/i] for the next twenty minutes, and in fact I NEVER touched any of the countries' pieces during the whole game -- and still won.) Another player was so bored she left in the middle of it (and she NEVER leaves a game that way), but SHE came in 3rd place out of 6.  Fiddling the bits around on the board may seem amusing until you realize it's all a pointless waste of time and has no effect on the outcome, due to the unrealistic and artificial scoring mechanisms. I could make this into a decent wargame so easily using the same bits that it's tragic to waste all that good material on such a useless boring game. The only reason I didn't rate it "2" is that it's conceivable someone I really like could twist my arm enough to make me play it again. It's just not likely. I think all the "10" ratings are from people who haven't yet realized how pointless it is to bother pushing the pieces around the board -- they THINK they're playing a wargame or something, because they haven't given the game itself any thought. The player comments from those rating it 5 or below show far more insight into the game. --- UPDATE: No, I decided it's inconceivable for anyone to talk me into playing this game.  If I liked them enough for them to talk me into playing it, I would talk them OUT of playing it.

Less and less fun with each additional play. Game is way too simple to be as long as it is, and players can easily be paralyzed by getting bumped out of control of a country. Too few interesting or fun decisions to be made. Game stalls out badly about half way through and limps to a conclusion.

Mixed feelings about the schizoid imperial cynicalism of investing in a country BUT waging war against it at the same time! It works, but only just. I like the investment mechanic, but combat and movement is not quite as interesting. I still feel myself growing impatient waiting for my turn, particularly with 5-6 players. It is a long game for a euro (2.5 hrs and up) - bit too long for me. I'd rather play a straight out wargame. End game is good, and I'd give it a go again, but can't see myself jumping on board too often unless it's a four player.

It starts a bit like a wargame with boats and tanks. Then you think, this map is the one of Diplomacy so there should be some diplomacy inside. In the end you realize that control of countries changes very fast. 
To sumarize Imperial it's a bit of all of this and the sum is more than each parts.
I'mthinking to downgrade all my votes for the other games.

RATING: 9
I am really bad at Imperial.  It took a me awhile to even understand the rules (luckily there was a long break before this game started so one of the other players worked with me to help me learn it).  It's hard to adjust to thinking about investing rather than thinking area control.  I love the rondel, but like all the mechanics in this game, it takes a while to figure out what you should be doing.  I'd definately play Imperial again because I'd like to wrap my brain around the really cool mechanics.  
****Update****
My rating for Imperial has improved as I play it more because it is a game that seriously punishes the new player.  I would recommend playing it with people who are at about the same skill level that you are.  It's hard to play Imperial when everyone is a new player, but it's no fun to play Imperial when everyone except you has played it many times.  

Also, my rating for Imperial only holds with more than three players.  With three I'd say Imperial is a eight at best.  But with five or six players, Imperial is a shinny penny!  Even if it takes a lot longer to play, each country becomes fully engaged in the game.  With three players, usually all of the players have one country that they are using as a shield or a prop for the countries that they are actually using to create their hopefully winning strategies. That leaves three nations to be weak and underplayed.  That's half that game that is unengaged!  I don't want to play Imperial like that.  I want each decision to be one that I care about.  With three players, half of the decisions I make don't matter to me or to anyone else.  Is this a flaw of the game? No.  I'd just say that Imperial isn't meant to be played with three because it is certainly one hell of a game with five or six!

***Musings***

I hated Imperial after the first play. It wasn't until the second play that I realized that there was something interesting with Imperial. Imperial is exciting and a trip, but it's disorienting and unpleasant on the first play. Each play perplexes me more and more. It's a brilliant game.  (If you've read this far and haven't played Imperial, what are you waiting for?)

I think this map is slightly better than the 2030 map, but both are good.  There is a bit more tension between nations as countries must invade neutrals and leave their home territory open.  Thus, it is easier for other countries to reduce factories at taxation.  

I have only played with the investor card, and though it is great fun, I don't really like how it plays out.  There are too many turns where players have money but cannot use it.  Why?  It doesn't make any thematic sense.

This is a fascinating game.  It played well with three players.  It will be interesting to try it with additional players and with the wealth of knowledge gained from playing it through the first time.  This game is a step through the looking glass.  What appears to be a game of military conflict is really a complex game of economics and posturing.  Trying it again with 5 players was a little disappointing.  I'm a little concerned that even with 5 players, the game play was disturbingly similar to my first experience.  This game would be much more interesting if it was quicker.

This is a rich "gamer's game", with a lot going on. It's a stock market game at heart, with a little economic development and a light-weight wargame mixed in. Difficult to fully understand the first time you play. It has one serious flaw: you can get stuck in a situation where you have very little or nothing to do for long stretches of time. This prevents me from rating this otherwise wonderful game a full "10."

My opinion on this one has changed drastically over the past few years.

RATING: N/A
Monopoly meets Risk where it isn't about how much territory you conquer, but rather how much money you've made at the end.  Gone over well with every group I have played with so far.

After numerous plays, I have begun to see the only flaw in this great game is the purchase of bonds that control the governments.  The values run from 1 to 8, but a player can buy up all the lower and cheaper bonds thus effectively preventing the other players from mounting an attempt to take control of a country.

Usually, this event happens when one player sees which country is doing well and then does the same thing to two or three other countries.  By that time, it is obvious they are going to win the game.  So after three hours of playing, I am wondering why the heck did I just waste this time over the game.

This problem wouldn't be so bad if players were all inexperienced in this game; however, once everyone gains enough experience.  It typically becomes a race to snatch up the leading country while two or three other players are just sitting around with little money or control of countries wondering what to do for the next hour and a half until the games ends.

You'll either love this or hate it, and the outcome of each game will probably determine which. I've had some games of this where at least one player has had a desparately depressing two hours of being dead last, so be warned on that score.

Excellent game... not because of the rondel, but the chancing country ownerships. Really good. I think the best number of players is 4, so there is a couple of loose countries (with 6 it easily becomes normal wargame, no controls chancing).

Very unique Euro game with a lot of direct player interaction, in which you only temporarily control different nations (and sometimes none of them at all). While I acknowledge the clever design, I am not a huge fan of this game. 

Being investors is a nice concept, but the restrictions to only being able to invest, when you have the investor card and that you are limited to only one security, feels very gamey and is a big downturn to me. I also dislike the Rondell mechanisms, since it gives a false impression of an annual cycle. Since you just can skip paying interests or collecting taxes, this feels wrong to me. Especially that skipping interest payments is possible, makes being only a minor creditor much more unattractive.

This thematic inconsistencies aside, this game has a lot of interesting decisions. Should you invest more in the country you control or should take over another country? Go for taxes now or expand you influence zones first? But there is also a lot of downtime in the game, especially if you only control one or even no country. 

In total a very good game, which is just not up my alley.

An interesting game which hides a wealth of strategy beneath simple and easy-to-learn rules.  The fact that players are investing in any number of nations rather than one makes for an exciting and intriguing game that ebbs and flows as the fortunes of the represented nations rise and fall.  Highly recommended.

Essentially the same game as Impeal 2030. Players 'invest' in countries which fight wars in early twentieth century Europe, while the players try to extract money and ensure they have the most shares in the succesful nations.
My first play of this was with two players who were taking it more seriously than a game with several inexperienced players and a newbie should be. It reminded me why Euro-games avoid player interaction. If you are upset by another players error or mis-judgement harming your position sufficiently that it spoils the game you are not going to enjoy this. Players can, and probably should directly attack each other. When you mess up it will hurt other players and offer opportunities for others to exploit. I like that, but I recognise that it takes a certain psychological readiness to handle it and the game can break down when some players don't have that.

RATING: 8.5
An unusual mechanics combining simple combat with investment.

Hard to disassociate yourself from becoming attached to the fortunes
of the countries involved; but a good investor cannot have sentimentality.

The weak points of the design are its long playing time and the possibility
that players can be shut out of controls and thus have a boring experience.

I played this for the first - and so far only - time in March 2014. It's an interesting game, one which I haven't really a clue as to the strategy for - it felt a bit like 18xx (with countries here replacing companies), but with much more interesting things going on and without most of the things I really dislike about 18xx games. I also liked the feeling of a crowded and ever-changing board - we played with 5, but I'm sure this will stay the same with fewer players, as there are still 6 countries in play. Overall I'd be happy and interested to play again, even though I don't think this is a game I'm ever going to love.

Imperial is an excellent, brain-melty game where the majority share-holders take micro-actions for each company (country) around the rondel. This is foremost an economic game but with elements of a war/area control game.

The gameplay is relatively simple, in that the actions you can perform are few and easy to understand. But the strategy seems almost impenetrable, because it's much more difficult to see your actions in relation to how you actually win the game.

I actually enjoy this sort of opacity, because I feel the game will still offer more to learn after repeated plays.  However, many players may not be willing to play enough to grow to appreciate it.

I've been thinking what about this game didn't endear it to me.  I especially thought it was interesting because I really like Shogun and mentioned when we'd finished Imperial I'd rather play Shogun and then I found that an entire discussion had taken place here on the geek about Shogun vs. Imperial.

In brief I think Shogun is more elegant, Imperial is like a fist fight, lots of conflict and not particularly subtle.  In Shogun you seem to be able to control your game more and don't have to play in your face unless you want to...the more games I play the more I learn about how games of direct conflict with multiple players turn me off.  I love a good wargame and own a lot of the AH classics, so it is not the conflict, but the out of control feeling that I don't like in Imperial.  BTW I did win Imperial when we played it and lost at Shogun so that didn't effect my opinion ... this time.

rating after 1 play (5pl, 4new,4hrs) - 8ish

really enjoyed this - everything i was hoping for - has feel of 1830 but with WAR instead of laying tracks *BIG GRIN* 

fun + depth - rating may well rise on this

btw i really disliked chicago express - that felt dull and obvious whereas this felt fun and unobvious

rating after 2plays (5pl 0new, 3hrs) - 8

still like it - have no idea how to play well yet but yearn for more plays to correct this

rating after 3plays (4pl 1new 4hrs) - 6
nb all games have been with investor card

hmm have changed my mind about this - it is still good fun BUT there are a lot of problems with it which i cant be bothered to write atm but basically it is scripted and overly balanced. the rondel's options are too limiting and u dont recive enuff reward for running a country - i will try it once more without the investor card to see if it makes a difference but i no longer see any 'game' here - at 1st it felt i was too stupid to see how to play this well but now it feels like there isnt any game here at all

Just like the rating says, not likely to ever play again.  There is what I call an almost complete thematic disconnect for me.  I never have any sense of playing a comprehensible role in the game (am I the Illuminati or something?), and the mechanics never seem to gel into anything fun or realistic for me.  It's a big advantage to control no country and to sit around for 3 hours, and the overall dearth of buying opportunities just isn't good.  Sorry, but nearly no fun.  Total waste of the rondel mechanic.

Probably the best economic game I've played.  The fighting on the board is great in that you don't feel like you are getting attack, but rather just a country that you are more heavily invested in, which removes the feelings of being personally attacked that can arise in multiplayer wargames.  It's a good implementation of a rondel as well, in that it really just limits you from doing some of the key actions like invest and taxation twice in a row, but being able to spend money to push further along the rondel gives you enough choice that the rondel is not limiting.  Turns really go very quickly - the only real downtime is when someone needs to decide what country bond to invest in, since it's hard to plan ahead exactly how much money you're going to have and the relative value of each country when your turn comes up to buy.  If you like stock games like Airlines Europe and Chicago Express, and also like multiplayer wargames like Game of Thrones, this is the perfect mixture of the 2. I'd also add that it's one of those games that doesn't take any longer with more players, since it's really the 6 countries taking turns and the controlling player just deciding what the country does, rather than each player taking turns.

This is now my least favorite rondel game.  I do not like the feeling of not being in control of your own destiny.  Still a good game though.

This is a good game.  It takes a while to figure the rules out and a little game play to really smooth out the mechanics.  Once you have everything figured out, the game is cool.  A mixture of battle for area control and economics though investments.  The game flows really well as does control of the various countries.

Fantastic game.  Hard to wrap your head around some of the strategies.  I love that your best interests often involve letting others do the work for you.  Setting up other players for my most advantageous move is a challenge that I really enjoy.  I also enjoy not feeling like you've wasted your game if your country (at the moment) becomes devastated.  Each country has a definate path similar to Diplomacy but after a full round, or two, things become very dynamic.  Even though I get nervous as this one is setting up, and I tend to have a slight headache at the end, I can't imaginge truning down a play of this.

An excellent economy game where you are not allocated a country or even a color to play with. You invest on countries and whoever holds the biggest investment in acertain country controls it. Control of countries switches often and sometimes unexpectedly. Moves in similar babysteps as Antike but a lot is till happening. The investor card seems unnecessary (it is removed in the advanced rules). Rating rose from 8 to 8.5 after second game.

This game continues to be one of my favorite Euros.  I find the timing aspect to be the most important part of the game.  Timing the takeover of contries to just before taxation, pushing the investor card or holding it up, determining when to push for the end game and so on.  Its critical to determine which countries will prosper and which fail, which may be more of an art than a science.  Overall, a great game.

I have a sneaking suspicion that Imperial is one of the best euro designs I've ever played. It's tense, vicious, and very thoughtful. There's a wonderful synergy between the investment mechanisms and the Diplomacy-like abstract military movement. And though it doesn't look like it on the surface, there is a lot of room to gang up, cajole, and generally smack down the other players. Very nuanced, nasty game, and I'm very impressed.

Schizoid situation: you have to think as a government but above all you are an investor! Even if you ruin your country it's possible to win ... if you just have invested in the right governments. Takeovers can happen more often than you think.
"Imperial" is a very good game with epic broadness. Our 5-player-game took us 5 suspenseful hours.
In my honest opinion it's better, not only because of the proper theme, than the re-implemented "Imperial 2030". No luck at all!

If played a lot, I could get into this - have usually been voting for Powergrid for 6 players instead. Engineered myself out of controlling any countries for about an hour of the game, and still felt deeply involved, so there are certainly mechanics I like in this one.  Edit Nov 09 - played a 6 player game of 2030 which was very painful, owing to having misremembered certain rules and having a poor start. Hopefully have now experienced the worst of this game. Hasn't put me off, but it reinforces the merits of eg Steel Driver, which is at least over in a reasonable length of time. Curious about trying the 2 player game

I't a good idea to incorporate the Swiss bank and rondel costs from Imperial 2030 into this.

----------
Not as complicated as I'd feared and an absorbing two hours. You just have to pay attention that the money is flowing in all the right directions. An interesting role playing the investor. Although many investments tend to lose you money in the final scoring they can be justified by how you used the country's forces and position on the rondel.

You don't want to get too far out ahead in owning a country as it's good to have fellow investors with a vested interest in keeping your country steaming ahead. It can also be a good idea to hold back your cash with some smaller investments and then jump ahead at an opportune moment.

To play with or without the investor card, that is the question. I see advantages and disadvantages, but ultimately the increase in speed of play wins out with me in favour of the investor card. Only play with the advanced setup and if players are not experienced then I wouldn't advise playing with more than four players.

Gamers seem to have a love/hate relationship with this one. Some players find the swinging ownership in a country and how that can ruin the best laid plans hard to come to terms with. Also, the real possibility that they won't control a country for a length of time can be boring. With players who enjoy the game it can be a wonderful experience, for others it should be avoided. I've experienced a dud game with players who haven't grasped the 18XX nature of the game. I really like it though. There's plenty of interesting choices. Lots happening on the board. The pace of the game is nice and quick.

Mac Gerdts took the historically important and outsized role that bond markets have often played in warfare and turned it into two brilliant board games (Imperial and Imperial 2030). These games teach the valuable lesson that since the advent of professional (and thus very expensive) armies the world's bankers and financiers have been as important to waging successful war than the generals and guns. My favorite Gerdts game (together with Imperial 2030). Great games!

Now this was a surprise.  I don't like Antike much - the Rondel is the one interesting feature - so hearing about the next game to use this idea didn't fill me with joy.  But the simple notion of having all the countries in the game all the time but their control switching hands at regular intervals is genius.  Rather oddly, the Rondel doesn't work nearly as well (I think it's the fact that there is only one "resource" in the game rather than several) but the rest of the game is fine.  I wouldn't want to play this with fewer than five people though, as I suspect that a fair amount of the timing tension would be lost, even though that makes the game a 3hr+ marathon.
10/06: Have stopped wanting to play this now.

RATING: 8
The most unusual Diplomacy variant yet! No Diplomacy, just share dealing. I like the theme so I would enjoy the game whatever its shortcomings. Better than Antike. I don't see a problem with not having a power, it helps you focus on the market and not the combat, which is almost irrelevant. Shares are limited which means leading players in the middle of the game are very difficult to catch. OK with 5 or 6 players.

RATING: 6
It's 18XX crossed with Diplomacy -- and pretty much played like I expected.  Although I didn't feel like I had any idea what I was doing, I squeaked out a win in my first play, so I must have done something right.  I suspect the general sense of how the game operates is highly subject to individual/group play styles -- the threat of military action can change financial planning, and vice versa.  All told, the game is a smart and solid progression in design from the eggertspiele folks -- Like Warfrog a couple years ago, I feel we are on the verge of a series of colossally cool releases from this company.

RATING: 6
The game is most like Antike, though it doesn't remind me of that as I've never played. And, then, it's also like the 18xx games, which I've also never played, in that the game isn't so much about conflict or controlling territory as it is in controlling bonds and having influence behind the scenes in several countries. It's sort of like World War 0.5, modeling the financial wrangling behind-the-scenes that likely led to armed conflict in the end. 

You could easily retheme the game to be about the Cola Wars, the European edition, with shareholders backing several Pop manufacturers as they work to increase market share across the continent. From the outside, it looks like the companies are fighting bitter battles to win customers in various countries but behind the scenes the shareholders, with interests spread across several "competing" brands, are colluding to increase the value of their shares: much like, I suspect (in my more conspiracy-minded moods), happens in the boardrooms of Pepsi, Coca Cola, and are there any other companies? Sometimes, I wonder if there's just one giant soda company with several brands: like a hydra with each head lashing toothlessly at the others so that noone notices they're all attached to the same body. 

Anyway, that's how the game felt to me. I think the Cola War theme would have actually worked better. It's a game for financiers, not a game for brigadiers. In either case, it's not a game for me. It's not bad, the game is good for what it is and not so long as to become painful, but it just didn't excite me very much. I could be convinced to play again, but I wouldn't seek it out.

Played at BGG.con '06. I'm giving it a 4.5 rating because I was really dissappointed - I thought I'd like it a lot more than I did. Antike was my favorite game of the con in '05, and this sounded like it was similar, but with a stock-control type of mechanic. That much is true, but there are some aspects of the game that I have major problems with. In particular, the Invester tile, which moves from player to player clockwise (turns are taken in country order, not player order, with the majority stockholder taking the country's turn). I am not happy with the idea that I can't buy stock to take over the country I want to use (based on board opsition) because my left hand opponent will simply take it back (because he gets the Investor tile next).

Buying stock is such a major factor, why couldn't the investor tile move at some time or in some way related to the game? Maybe when you cross the Investor line on the Rondell (which is when the Investor tile triggers), the player moving there should take the tile or something? I dunno, just something that's not so metagame related would be nice.

I really wanted to like this game. I may have to try again with the variant rules I've heard mentioned.

Edit: Finally played again... WITHOUT the Investor card, and liked it a lot better. Still not my favorite type of game, but it wasn't as horrible as the last time. Upgraded rating to 5.

After only one play, strangely enough, I found the game much less engaging to actually play than to think about when not playing. The goals seemed somewhat opaque—how what we were doing all along would influence who would win. Familiarity with more play would likely fix that, but it didn't grab me well enough to make we want to play again.

Not just another resource-and-war-game, but a whole new level on top of that. Forget about picking a single country and trying to have it win. Instead, be fickle and change your loyalties when it suits you (i.e. when it will earn you the most money).

This extra layer makes it a very fresh and fluent game.

I love the roundel mechanism.

Small flaw: In the first/basic edition (Europe/Norh Africa map) the potentials of the different countries are more or less pre-defined by the map layout. That makes e.g. Italy always a good country to invest in.

Our gaming group has a blast playing this game. Even my girlfriend loves it. The dynamics that go on in this game are rare and initially hard to 'grasp' for some players, at least initially. Must always be ready to adapt, and absolutely willing to scheme, manipulate and potentially even screw over other players to win.

This was my very first Rondel game.  It is also a fascinating economic game.  I'm still not sure how I feel about the Rondel mechanism, but it seems to work in the context of this game.  I like how it limits the possible actions and forces you plan ahead in order to get things done.  As for the game, the economic development and conquest is something of a different take on the whole genre.  [03/13/2011]

 A nice game,

 + Player interaction is high.
 + heavy and deep 
 + very good from 3 players up
 - not too good in a 2 player game because of the hard posibility for a player to came back in the game after few wrong moves in the beginning
 - for many people would be very frustrating to understand the taxation and the investor fields because of the not so good rules.
 - dont apreciate too much the mechanism and the fact you can play a long time without a country that makes this game not so fun

Played it only once so far, but it got me right away. Love the original approach of not having one position. Plenty of diverse strategies available.

Played my 3rd game last night. I tried the gambit written here on the geek somewhere. My fellow players noticed what I was aiming for and pretty soon locked me out of the cheap stocks. I was locked out of the game after the first half hour and could not re-enter as a player owning a flag untill the last turn, no matter what I tried. But... I managed to come in second in the end with only 10K less then number one... That's not good. I think it has the same scriptiness as Antike although we all don't really understand right now, what that exact script will be.

Hard to rate. 

I needed a year to find the players who would buy the premise of the game (they didn't, I just didn't tell what we're going to play). And all of them kinda dozed off through the rules explanation (which are fairly simple). Than the first portion of the game happened which was marked by "mine, mine" attitude of owning a country and fighting and tension in the air. They I started milking my country and took me a couple of turns to convince the owner of another one which I had shares in, to do the same. This was a lightbulb moment and a game changed into something else, people were buying stocks, not fighting anymore as they were involved in both sides of the conflict. Suddenly the game was much more peaceful, friendly even. And the second threshold was reached when I tried to figure out how to go from taxation to investor as fast as it went. From then on it was a tense race of buying last stocks, speculation and race to finish or (more commonly) stalling. 

The description shows that the game slowly reveals its charms and I'm left with an impression there are many more thresholds to reach, that there is a still a lot of mystery to discover. The game absolutely earns respect and did create interesting interaction effects even on its first game. And there are 4 more variants existing - the non-investor card version (probably better than with investor), longer set up version (probably better with more experience), swiss bank variant (fun), and negotiation variant (for when you think you know the game). 

My only worry is that I might not play it enough to see all of it. The premise doesn't sound charming and the visuals are unpleasant at the least, so it's hard to bring it to the table. And the game is puzzling to people who are used to quickly consume a game and get it in one or two tries. (The copy was borrowed from owner who played it once, and probably never again will). I think it's a marvel of a game that was long time in creation and it shows by the organic feel of it, its depth and many possible variants to play. Here's to hope I can play it more.

This is definitely my favorite game to play right now. It may look like a war game but don't be fooled. It's all about puppeting countries into doing your bidding, for your own personal financial gain. I love the theme, but also the game runs really smoothly with fairly simple, easy to learn game play, deep strategy, and plenty of maniacal laughter.

[3 plays]  Good game. Lots to think about, many different ways to control your fate once you get your brain wrapped around the processes. Best played at a crisp pace if possible.

The theme is a quirky stretch on early 20th century war and politics, but it works for me. The mix between a stock game and a diplomacy/wargame is very interesting. The rondel mechanism is cool. The components, artwork, etc are all top notch.

This is Acquire on steroids crossed with Diplomacy, but without much negotiating and no backstabbing. Crazy fun.

Imperial is a finely crafted, dynamic, luckless, in-your-face economic game. Luckless does not mean without chaos, though, and people tend to either like or dislike Imperial based on how reactive it is. From a strategic perspective, Imperial doesn't really allow a player to pick a strategy and stick with it. In the early game, you must be a generalist with respect to strategy, positioning yourself soundly in the financial interests of a few nations, and working to develop a nation that you control. I haven't really determined whether I like or dislike this about Imperial: the fact that winning often comes down to the last few rounds of play. To be sure, to be in a *position* to win, you must make good decisions in the early and middle game, but I don't think you need to make *optimal* decisions. Just good, solid ones. Then it all comes down to how deftly you play the end game. So far, I think I like how this plays out. Every player seems to have a viable shot at winning, so long as s/he plays fairly well early on.

Overall, I really like this game. Imperial is an economic game at heart, and even though it features soldiers and ships, it isn't a war game. There are plenty of opportunities for military conflict though, and used judiciously, doing so can really help advance your plans. But becoming too militaristic will hurt you and drain your resources. You must stay focused on developing your financial holdings. Each player in Imperial is an investor, and you buy bonds in different countries. He who holds the most bonds in a country controls that country. But ownership can and does change throughout the game via what amount to a series of hostile takeovers.

There are a variety of things going on in Imperial. While you try to improve whichever country you control, you are also trying to invest other well-managed countries, make money for yourself, and block other players from becoming too powerful. And you must strive to achieve all this in a constantly shifting battlefield as other players' choices significantly change the game. Imperial is a medium weight game in my opinion, which sometimes dips into heavy territory near the end when you are calculating which decisions will yield the best outcomes. Things about the game I really like:

1. It's very dynamic - the situation is always developing and you must be flexible to take advantage of new opportunities.
2. There doesn't seem to be a kingmaker problem - everyone is in the running to win.
3. Play is in-your-face, with national takeovers and using military units to occupy (shut down) opponent factories and what not. I like the combat aspects of the game. Frankly, in a game about the ascendance and decline of nations, Imperial's combat rules capture area control exactly right - to my way of thinking.
4. The rules, the system, the components...everything is very elegant. There aren't any rules which feel like clutter. Because of this, Imperial is easy to teach and easy to remember between games. No re-learning rules required.
5. Pretty board and pieces! Very satisfying from a tactile and/or visual perspective.
6. Although I like luck, no luck in this game is a bonus. You really succeed or perish based on your decisions. Player choice introduces all needed chaos.

The major criticism against Imperial is that it is too reactive. I can't tell yet whether it even allows discretely different strategies. This isn't a dream game for "builder" type players who like to plan something out carefully and then create it without allowing anyone else to mess with it. I'm thinking of the way you build your own factory in Factory Fun or your own palace in Alhambra. Imperial also fails to capture the balance between strategy and tactics that something like Go achieves. Imperial doesn't reward strategic geniuses. It rewards tactical geniuses who have solid strategic skills. And in the end, it's details like this which will often determine who likes the game and who doesn't. For my money though, it is an outstanding game that blends interesting mechanisms so that the whole surpasses the mere sum of parts - unlike a game such as Yspahan which throws together a bunch of gamey mechanisms and ends up with a whole equal to *precisely* the sum of its parts.

Update: I remain concerned about the seemingly overwhelming impact of late-game decisions, but feel that I need to play a few more games. My rating will either stay very, very high, or drop to a 5 or 6.

RATING: 6.8915
I really wasn't expecting to like this one at all.  It looked too much like a combination between Diplomacy and the typical generic multi-player wargame, and the rules seemed to be a bit heavy and different for what I was in the mood to play.  I haven't played very many games that require stock purchasing.  Some describe the game as having no luck.  That might actually be true.  I'm not a fan of wargames without luck, but this only wasn't too bad possibly because the wargame portion of the game is almost an afterthought.  The map, no luck, and the wooden pieces definately make me think of an updated version of Diplomacy, although I've never played that game.  However, this game feels more like Diplomacy with musical chairs as the most interesting part of the game involves switching control of the various empires between the players acting as investors.  I built up an army with France to confront Italy in North Africa then the two players that controlled France and Italy suddenly switched sides!  Everyone got to play Italy and Britain at least once, although I lost control of Britain again before I actually got to do anything with it.  I played it as a three-player game.  I think this would probably be the best way to play it.  I'm not sure how the six empires would be divided among four or five players; I'm told that things can stay rather static with six players, and I don't know that there would be much interaction with only two players.

Végre sikerült kipróbálnom a nagy elődöt és tényleg nem sok a különbség a két változat között (Imperial - Imperial 2030), de amik vannak azok mind az új kiadás felé billentik a mérleget. A térkép nehezebben átlátható, az egységek túl nagyok ezért néha alig férnek el a táblán. Jó dolog a teljes átjárhatóság, aminek hiánya ebben a régi verzióban mind az angolok, mind az oroszok helyzetét kicsit megnehezíti. Az országot nem irányító játékos helyzetét is jobban megoldották az új verzióban, de nekem az adóztatásban megjelenő különbség a legszámottevőbb. Ugyanis egyrészt ebben a kiadásban alig férnek el a bábuk az adott táblarészen, még akadályozzák is kicsit az orosz hadiflottát a táblán és macerásabb kiszámítani is a játékosnak járó bónuszt. Ez sokkal jobban ki van találva az új verzióban. Átláthatóbb, a táblán pedig jobb helyre került ennek a táblázata is.
Összességében a két játék közt nincsenek nagy különbségek, de amik vannak, azok mind az új verzióban jobbak. Egyedül talán a pénzlapok minősége jobb a régiben.
A játékban egyedül talán a hosszába tudnék belekötni. Teljesen elképzelhető, hogy nem nagyon érdeke senkinek befejezni a játékot így nagyon hosszúra is elnyúlhat, ettől függetlenül szerintem egy nagyon jó játékról van szó. Nem feltétlenül van 1 pontnyi különbség a két kiadás között, de mivel csak egészekkel pontozok így valahogy különbséget kell tennem. Akinek viszont csak ezt a verziót van lehetősége megvenni, ne habozzon, tökéletesen játszható ez is, ugyanolyan élményt adva.

Geez, what a good game! A map reminiscent of Diplomacy (a good thing) and many great decisions to make during the game. A GREAT strategy game with a low rules overhead. No die rolling or random events or cards to play either; there is no luck here, apart from starting turn order.
PLAY WITH: No investor variant, advanced setup variant, and Swiss Bank Variant (Swiss Bank: only if you are playing with newbies).

Though it is rated for 2-6, forget playing with 2 or even 3. 6 player is chaotic also. Best with 4 or 5 players.

Very, very solid and intriguing game. Only an 8 to me partly because it is slightly on the dry side, but mostly because it is more to my taste to identify with belligerant nations than with hidden investors scheming in the shadows. Also, I will play it mostly solo and, while enjoyable (and amazingly difficult to "calculate"), I have a tendency to take nation, rather than investor turns, just because, mostly at the beginning when the situation is still fluid, it is really difficult to keep track of the entangled and mixed interests at play. A problem with the investor card, which makes for repeated changes of hand of the most valuable nations towards game end and hysteric resulting conducts (to avoid triggering endgame), but can be fixed with official variant getting rid of the card. Also, one of the worst rulebook I've ever seen on something this simple.

Wwhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  What an awesome system.  This is a brutal mindmelting goodybag.  There are so many possibilities to take into account here, who to invest in, when to try for majority or when to intend to keep minority.  There are a ton of natural objectives that come out of the design like trying to invest adjacently on the map, in order on the turn track, and/or with mutual investors.  

It seems that getting bought out often can work to your advantage.  This is really a lovely system, it feels like it took everything wonderful in this modern era of gaming and ported it into the minds of some of the best designers from the 50's - the early 70's. 

Expect to play this tactical, but know that as brutal as it is that you are in it for the long haul and what little long term strategies you can form are going to aid you if you can put everything into position.

Much like all of the 18xx games, use poker chips.  It will make the banks much easier to "read" from across the table.

Don't underestimate the option to pay to move on the rondel.  Timing is everything in this game.  Imagine in 18xx the constant potential of your trains rusting or sudden buy outs.  If you get into conflict games and stock games, this is the one for you.  


UPDATE: The more I play this the more I love it.  I do not recommend playing with 6 players though as there will be at least one player that gets squeezed out with nothing that they can do for the rest of the game.  We play with the variant where you get a buck if you don't buy stocks when without a flag.

UPDATE: The No-Investor Card variant is great as it balances the game out dramatically, but I think perhaps it takes a little more of the fun out of it and makes it a bit more deterministic.  It seems that it plays best at 4 without the Investor card and 5 with the Investor card and the C.H.O.A.M. Charity.

UPDATE: This is really a perfect 4 player game without the investor card.

This is a great stock game.  Not a war game, a stock game.  The competition of the stocks is abstracted out to a board that represents Europe, but the essence of the game is investment, not warfare.

Virtually perfect game, whether you play with or without the investor card. No luck, simple rules, great bits, perfect balance, there's nothing not to love here.

Revised down to 9 after additional plays: the game always ends with the rondel-pump, which is pretty boring. Also, it would be nice if there was a consensus on the investor card. I have played both ways and find the game very different depending on which way one plays, but can't say which one is better.

Great game!  I have played twice on BSW and one complete game with a group of 6.  I was the only one that had ever played before and no-one seemed to get that this is NOT a war game!!!!  Russia even ran out of armies to place on the board.  To add insult to injury -  the guy that spent all his time amassing armies instead of taxing and paying out dividends (oh why did I invest all my money in Russia) came in a very close 2nd at the end.  Bad behavior should not be encouraged by (almost) winning!!!! :)

Well, I finally (finally) got to play Imperial last night and it did not disappoint. 5 players with the investor card version. After a quick explanation of the rules which I must say were easy to digest, we were off and running. The game had flavors of Diplomacy and Princes of the Ren. I liked the uber stock game that literally surrounded a light war game in the middle. Initially I had a hard time understanding some of the mechanics of the Rondell, most notably how to make $, but by mid game it all just flowed and made sense. Wonderfully engaging with lots of table talk, I cannot wait to play again.

A sort of stock market style Risk. You don't own any specific nation, and because the players controlling nations at a given time can change, the nature of the alliances change over time.

Imperial is a great medium-heavy euro. It's very opaque, but the rules aren't complicated. To win players must effectively manipulate incentives, convincing and coercing others to help each other out. Full of shifting allegiances, it's a dynamic, nasty experience, so you need to pay attention on every turn. The theme is wonderfully cynical.

That said, because there's no luck, it can be a bit scripted and prone to groupthink with experienced players. There's also a bit more rules overhead and the game is longer than Chicago Express, and the endgame is a bit calculating and gamey. It's still a great design, but the game's success depends greatly on the group. Imperial is the sort of game you could and probably should replay again and again with the same group. Outside of that context, however, it suffers a bit.

This is sort of like Antike (rondel, similar movement & combat, rules simplicity) combined with a stock game (shares, "operating" ie taxing to improve company/country revenue/worth). Players control 6 nations by having invested the most (most share worth). Countries can build/buy military units, develop revenue (build factory, expand territory), collect taxes (which also improves the value of the country's shares), etc. Each nation has its own treasury separate from player monies, and players must manage cash flow well.

2nd play, another 6er (4 newbies). This one dragged on for 2.5 hours, which isn't really bad! The winner somehow managed to lose his country at the right time and was then able to invest repeatedly - I'm not sure I like that, although I might if I can figure out how to do it! Still a solid game, but I wouldn't play more than 4er with newbies, to minimize between-turn downtime.

My first play was more of a learning game, as I felt a little lost for the first 2/3, playing it more like Risk-big mistake!  Controlling a country isn't nearly as important as I expected, except when you're able to raid the treasury and tax your citizens.  For some reason, it feels a bit claustrophobic to me, but maybe that's just a personal quirk.  I want to play it again and my rating could increase.

RATING: 5
This is an economic game with some light Risk-style war game/area control elements.  In this game players become controllers of different world powers and those powers themselves "take turns" with the controlling player deciding which action that world power takes.  These actions are decided using a Rondel (it is a Mac Gerdts game after-all) and consist of buying bonds in a specific country, paying out investors, and taxing the country as well as producing and moving units to take over more area.

Even though the economic elements are the lion's share of this game, I couldn't help but feeling like this game boiled down to Risk.  And I don't like Risk.  Honestly, even the whole package with the economic elements was very dry.  The game was very deep and I didn't even quite get how I should play but it didn't offer anything to draw me back in and figure it out.  There's certainly an audience for this game, I'm just not part of that audience.

A really nice game. Played with 4 player, all cutthroats, but none had played the game before. During the game three players - including me, got to feel the pain when the control of their last country got bought. Only major drawback was the playtime, we played for 4 hours to make it to the ending, mostly because all off us focused on war and not economy for the first hour. With more experience of the rules and more understanding of the object of the game this would probably not be an issue. If so the rating could go up. I finished last by far.

Ok, played it another time, 4 players. The game is fun but so unintuative. And it drags a little. 3 hours this time and then everybody around the table tried to earn money, it was our focus. And if you doent controll any country in a part of the game, that part is rather boring. It doenst shine. Maybe it will, eventually, who knows.

I like the game very much. 

It has excellent mechanics, and it is very, very original. It's one of the most original and brilliant games I've ever played and it will always be a part of boardgaming history.

It is a top 10 game pedigree for its brilliance.

Superb game. The best game of 2006.

It won the prize "Jogo do Ano 2006" - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Jogo_do_Ano

My top #1 game. I like economic games and Imperial gives players that opportunity. Also, the challenge to play it well is the most interesting thing this game has because you not only have to take good decisions when controlling a country and manage your own money but also when disputing the best way to give up or grab a nation's flag. 
It has perfect information, no luck involved and players who play better win. I believe that in this game the best player always wins (the player who plays better).

RATING: 6
Interesting but rather complex (at least for me). The concept of not playing the nation but investing into it (and likely several of them) and with that making (=influencing) the moves of the country is nothing I have played before, it seemed a bit abstract at first but not without appeal. I am a bit undecided so far on whether I like "Imperial" but I think I am willing to play again and that is always a good sign; but sure not easy to pick up and learn.

This is yet another game for people that need to play a wargame, but can't play an actual wargame.  Min/Maxing, perfect info, and a longer play time than I would like to devote to a game that is so dry.  The plus side is that it isn't as bad as some of the Wallace titles.  My dad might have put it best by saying "if you want to play a wargame, then play a wargame".

RATING: 8
Very interesting game.  This game has you owning shares of countries that you buy stock in, the person with the most stock controls that country and performs that countries actions.  This little aspect makes the brutal attacking and cutthroat blocking seem less critical, since you have interest in more than one country.  What I mean is, in other wargames, if you are Germany, and you get attacked, it is a big deal and you feel the pressure of trying o defend, well in Imperial, since you only own shares in Germany, it is not such a kick in the gut when something bad happens.  So when Austria is dominating the game and kicking Germany’s ass, you can simply buy stock in Austria.  I definitely need to play this again because I am intrigued and it is deep enough that I haven’t begun to truly grasp the strategy during my one play.

I've plaed it twice now and I am really starting to enjoy the investor aspect.  I was very congniscent of rondel position in this play and I ended up in a close second.  I enjoyed this enough to pick up Imperial 2030.

****Update***

After a few more plays I have come to understand the relationships between nations and how to manipulate them more.  For example, I was in a situation where Russia was vulnerable to an Austrian arms build-up and instead of locking horns with them (with would benefit none of the principles), I instead bought the leading interest in Austria and pointed them in a different direction.  I also learned ot use the Rondel to buy into companies when they are ripe for Invest or possibly Taxation.  All in all an impressive game design.  I do liek the 2030 rule where the amount to pay for going extra spaces on the wheel scales with the power points of a country.  This prevents the leader from banging away at Tax-Ivest-Tax.

RATING: 8
The fact that you do not have exclusive ownership of any nation takes this out of the Risk/Axis camp and makes it something new. It's as if the players are arms dealers. This game is about empire building and combat, but the point is not to dominate, it's to bet on the winner.

A cross between Risk, Broker, Diplomacy and... who cares! It's a great game! Not easy to grasp at first, but the rondel and overall mechanics instantly make this a favourite. It's engaging, with strategy and tactics harmoniously holding hands. The fact that you are an investor with a varied portfolio of nations, temporarily managing the fate of a few of them (or not), but not "owning" any, as you piggyback on the strategy and management of the other players, makes this game an engrossing experience. Highly recommended.

I'm giving this a provisional 9.  I really like what I saw in my first play, though we didn't use the investor card(we should have) I'm looking forward to the second play.  The only thing about imperial is the need to move it along when people take a bit too long on their turn.  (first rule of gaming: fast is fun)

Update:  Down to a seven.  I just don't find myself wanting to play this game.  Ever.  The fun just isn't there, and now that the hype is over is seems a shell of what I'd hoped it would be.

Wow, I am really bad at this.  Just horribly bad.  I think it's because it looks like a strategy game, but in fact it's a tactical stock-market-manipulation game: the winner is going to be the person who takes control of countries just long enough to tax them, then dump them again.  A skill I don't seem to have.

Only played this once so far but not as wowed as I thought I would be.  The basic premise of the game sounds very interesting on paper, but in play it seems to distill down to everybody just trying to make "their" country the most powerful.  Many say this is the wrong approach that many beginners use before they "get" the game, so maybe my gaming experience will improve with more plays but I'm not completely sure of that.

Rating based on one play with 3.  Very fun game.  Takes several ideas from Antike and makes a much better game.  Attrition-based combat doesn't bother me as much as it usually does, because a nation's ownership can change.  Even if players are waiting to pounce on an area that was just weakened by two parties fighting, another player may be waiting to take control of that very nation away.  A lot going on, yet simple and short enough to get played fairly often.  I can't wait to play again.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  I was concerned going into the game that it would be full of diplomacy, deal making, and alliances.  Those type of games are just not my favorite.  However, the game really did not feel in this one play that it had a lot of that going on.  What I found was a calculating game that really has a very low luck element too it.  I thought it was a good unique game, kind of like a war game but really not.  I thought it fit the theme well.  I would definately play this game some more times, I had a lot of fun play this.  It did take us a while to play, for our group any calculating game takes a long time.  This was not terrible but it was at the border of what I consider "too long".

RATING: 7.5
[Eggert-Spiele 07 Edition] {Europe, civilization, economic; fighting, stock holding, rondel; optimal 4-6p}  Imperial is a decent stock-holding game.  It is unique in mechanic and game feel.  I quite love it.  A game turn is fast and a typical game can be finished within 2 hours (very good!).  It has no luck and is serious - it is only suitable for gamers.  The game situation is opaque; players need good skills and experiences to understand the situation and act accordingly.

It is a multifaceted game. Players can develop many strategies and tactics to get better scores.  It supports long-term strategic planning well.   A player can choose manage multiple nations or no nations at all.  It is not chaotic even with 6 players!  Player interaction is strong.  Although it is not target as a negotiation game, negotiation skill is quite important in this game.

I don't really like the battle system though it is simple and no luck.  It brings no surprises or dynamic factor to the game.  It makes a war quite dry.  I still prefer some randomness in a battle.

The components are effective and sturdy.  However, the borders on the board are not clear enough.  I like the wooden pawns - sturdy and nicely shaped :)  The rulebook is not professionally proof-read.  There are typos and ambiguities.

I wanted to like Imperial. I did. I had caught a whiff of the hype on BGG about it and thought that the Rondel sounded neat and some of the other mechanics could be cool. So I asked a friend to bring it to a recent game night, and we gave it a play. There was mass confusion at first as we struggled through the rules--even the people who'd played once or twice were having some trouble refreshing themselves--but the game flow was pretty simple once we got the hang of it. It's largely a war game with economic aspects in how it plays out (not in its win conditions, but we'll get there later), and I'm not much of a war game person, so it didn't grab me much there. The fact that we could steal control of countries from each other and, indeed, make it so someone really didn't have a turn at all was interesting. I mostly contented myself with running Germany into the ground (did I mention that I'm bad at war games?) and buying stocks from whatever country seemed to be doing well at the moment.

And... I won. I managed to [i]accomplish absolutely nothing of value[/i] the entire game, and still came in first place. And while I find that interesting, I also feel like it's a very cheap win. Yes, you can argue that I handled the game exactly as I should have, and that the others who were doing better on the war-game front had lost sight of the actual victory conditions, or whatever other argument you want to posit. But in the end, I just don't feel like it was a satisfying win for me, or probably for anyone else at the table. And I'd probably let that slide if I enjoyed the actual gameplay more, but I didn't. The Rondel was neat but nothing earth-shattering, and I'm just not big on moving armies around. I don't have a head for that sort of game and find myself just sort of blandly going through the motions when I play such. I'm sure for the right sort of person, Imperial is AWESOME. But I'm not that person.

RATING: 6
Much better IMHO than Antike, it's sister.  But still not a great game by any stretch.  Plays relatively smoothly but it's hard to figure out what will be a good buy early and an investor sometime has to rely on a competent governor. Played with investor card which seems to make the game seem almost broken as you wait 30 minutes to buy a single bond, I also lowered it a notch since you basically sit on your butt waiting for your turn, which can be a a good long wait if you are playing wiht careful opponents.

You can benefit from what different countries are doing on the board by buying shares in them. The major shareholder takes control of the country. Good game but it sucks when you no longer control any country. Having shares in the most successful countries on the board will win you the game, not necessarily controlling more than one country.

Excellent business game. Superb management of when to own certain Empires to reverse the flow of the game and set off chain reactions in players loyalties and affiliations.

Don't like playing with the restriction and unpredictability of the investor card. The alternative variant is a little too tight on money at the end so I prefer a house rule of allowing players to combine more than one of their bonds to buy a larger bond. This gives more options later in the game when larger sumes of money are required. 

One of the best games in the last few years.

RATING: 8
A game with a learning curve, which is no bad thing. First play left me as a passive investor forever starved of cash (3 hrs with only 10 minutes of controlling a nation! Fun only if you like watching TV and betting on the result). Now after 4 plays, I have a much stronger feel for the game, and a better idea on what needs doing and how to go about it. So far, all games have been with the Investor card, and I like the timing issues that this involves. Maybe one day I'll try it without the Investor Card to see how that works.

RATING: 7
Rondel-driven game set during the age of European imperialism. Players purchase bonds in nations (there are six of these in the game), with the person holding the largest stake controlling the actions of that country. Actions consist of constructing factories, building and manoeuvring military units, taxing factories and conquered territories etc. There are two distinct forms of currency in the game, a nation's funds, which is used to build it's infrastructure and to pay out dividends to investors, and the money belonging to the investors (players), which is used to increase their investments in particular countries. The investment aspect of the game is the one real flaw to by found in the gameplay as a player requires possession of the investment card and only then can shares be purchased. This brings an element of luck to the game as players ahead of others in turn order can invest in the more powerful nations, and it can be frustrating not to be able to invest despite having sufficient funds due to a quirk of the game. 'Imperial' is a very well devised game and there's a lot going on here to admire in terms of gameplay (I particularly like how ownership of the nations can change hands several times in a game resulting in players having to quickly re-adapt their strategies), but generally I get a sense of there being a little too much being in the right place at the right time (just like history actually) that prevents this from being a classic.

RATING: 8
One play with the investor card. That was a pretty interesting experience.  I really liked the opportunities presented by the fact that you can invest in the various countries.  If a country is threatening you, just invest to a controlling stake and send the country's forces elsewhere.  Lots of neat ideas.  I like that most of the battles for gain are over neutral countries and you never really loose your starting provinces.  Someone can occupy your country but it only hurts you and they don't gain anything.  I also like the various actions to make the countries money and turn the money into player money.  The scoring was also interesting.  I have some reservations that the action on the roundel is a little linear. Conclusion: my rating could rise after playing the advanced version which changes the investing. 2008/03/23

A much more satisfying game when you get the rules right (first game took twice as long as it should have because we playing taxation incorrectly, paying our armies before calculating power points). Only realised at the end of the game how wasteful it was getting involved in ownership struggles in the second half of the game. Better idea would be to invest, cash in, cede control, then let others do the work on the board while investing my cash wisely. Oh well, maybe I can try that next time.

This game is very deep.  It can be unforgiving to new people.  The game can sometimes suffer from group think.  It is filled with negotiation, choices and lots of fun.  I love how there is no luck but it still doesn't feel dry.  The random actions of other players bring in enough freshness.  A lot of new players lose because they play this as a war game.  It's actually quite funny.  An unforgiving game which can be a positive or negative.

I traded this game because I want to get the new edition of Imperial and could not see my self owning both versions

Zseniális játék. Szeretem a fordított gondolkodást igénylő játékokat (lásd még: Last Will). Remek ötlet és eleddig a legjobb rotás játék, amit ismerek. Az országok vezetésével nem az egyes birodalmak javát kell nézni, hanem kizárólag a saját javunkat és csak ez alapján szabad döntést hozni. Aki kibillen a szerepből és érzelmileg elköteleződik egy ország vagy egy befektetés mellett, az menthetetlenül bukik.
A diplomáciának és a részvénybirtoklási (országirányítási) stratégiának kiemelt a jelentősége. Egy-egy birodalmat többféleképpen is lehet az érdekeinknek megfelelően fel/kihasználni. 
5-6 fővel nem érdemes játszani, mert a játékélményt mégiscsak az nyújtja, ha tevékenyen részt veszünk az országok irányításában és ekkora játékosszámnál, már könnyebben előfordul, hogy "kiesnek" a játékból némelyek. 4 fővel tökéletes az egyensúly és kellően pörgős a játékmenet, ugyanakkor az interakciók változatossága is megvan. Remekül el van találva, ahogy a játék elkezd begyorsulni. Remek az újrajátszhatósága. Kiváló játékélményt nyújtanak a döntések. Egyszerűen imádom ezt a játékot.
A jó játék egyik legfőbb ismérve, a letisztult szabályrendszer. Az Imperialnál ez tökéletesen eltalált. Az Imperial 2030 viszont némi csalódást okozott: túlbonyolított, feleslegesen komplikál és ezzel nincs arányban a játékélmény-növekmény.

A Winsome-like train game disguised as an area control/war game. Better than almost any stock-and-rails game save for maybe Chicago Express, and certainly better than your average 18xx. 

Opaque, but not so much that it's completely out of reach for new players. But get caught up in the area-control trap and you'll lose to someone who is just making the best investments.

A cynical game in the best possible way, and a game I would call a quintessential gaming experience.

Imperialism cannot compete with simple efficient investment. If groupthink makes all players warlike, the game may work. Antike is much better. To some extent I think achieving the diplomatic balance needed for a pure economic strategy gets harder with fewer players because of the need to build more military to race for the more numerous empty territories, but I still feel once that race is done optimal play is to turtle peacefully. If factories could be captured and used, as in Diplomacy, then imperialism would pay off.

Wow! Like Antike but with more depth (I recommend both games). It's very weird to start thinking outside the conventional "I control this country" box. Look forward to the next session.

I would have prefered some kind of poker type chips instead of paper money, but that's nitpicking.

Playing time can be an issue.

This is an interesting Rondel game with an aspect of war and an aspect of economy.  I think a big part of my lower than average rating is that I was told on several occasions that this really isn't a war-based game and that I should focus on the economics.  Well, that is not true as far as I am concerned!  You can get in a pretty deep death spiral with that thinking.  It also feels too long by a bit.

Oh, wow. This is an incredible game. The rules are astonishingly simple but the game itself is quite complex to play well. So many things to consider. I've played three games with 3, 4 and 6 players. All games worked equally well the six-player game being the fastest one.

Great game with a hell of a lot possibilities. 
It's really difficult not to get caught on the "but this is MY COUNTRY" trip.
Investing in your own country is often enough wrong.
There are few games which I replay in my mind after the game is finished as long as this one!

I would have gotten Imperial but the possibility to play on BSW and the 0% Chance to get my wife to play it kept me from buying it.

Comes into its own after a few plays. With an experienced group this game is 2 hours of engrossing fun. Outstanding!
Update: After 40 games with the "no investor card" variant, we have switched to using the card, and we like the game even more. Less downtime with an added layer of strategy.

Only dry-run this so far but played out the entire game as it was so enjoyable. Sure I got some of the subtleties very wrong, as there is so much going on. Can't wait for my first proper game but rated a 9 for now.
Update - played 3P and very, very good. Can't wait for the optimal 4P.
Update - played with 5P and it's extraordinary. I love the way you play as investors and only really get a turn if you have bought enough into a nation to control it - kind of like Acquire but even more so. Fab!

RATING: 5
I found this pretty interestng, but my first game with six players (five new players) plus rules explanation clocked in at over four hours, which is a concern. Looks like the sweet spot might be four players, and obviously things will speed up with fewer players. I'm on the fence with this one, though. Even while players were new to Imperial, our game was filled with experienced gamers, and even at the end of the game, nobody seemed to grok what a clear-cut winning strategy is. Maybe that will become clear with repeated play, but I usually have a better idea after a full game. The limited opportunities to buy stock in a 6-player game was a bit frustrating, and definitely dictated a lot of what was possible ... perhaps that's solved with fewer players, as well. Without having played with fewer, I'm guessing Imperial doesn't shine with a full compliment of 6 players. Need to try this with four players, as it has a lot of interesting things going on. Update: Played with four, and still found Imperial to drag a little, with downtime a problem. This is OK, but not something I need to own. Rating adjusted down to a 6 - interesting but flawed.

RATING: 7
Played once with one major rule error and once with the correct rules, all with 4 players. This is a very complex game strategy-wise and one that cannot be played with unequal ability levels as the experienced ones will eat up the newbies. Components are nice and easy to see at a glance. There can be a lot of down time between turns, especially if others have control of multiple governments. The rondel really makes this game possible. Without it, it would be a bland game. Might be too complex and long for my game group (and me), but it sure is an interesting one.

RATING: 7
The war game in Imperial is simple and serves as a reason to buy bonds in the affected countries.  The inability to SELL said bonds seems like a missed opportunity.  What better way to chew up a country and spit it out than to rid yourself of ownership?  You have to be successful at speculation games to win Imperial, and your battle instincts may help.

Mac Gerdts is defintely turning into one of my favorite game designers. Importing the magnifically done action-choice-system from his very own Antike,Imperial comes up with a very important as well as very interesting difference. You don't control one nation(or colour), you invest in as many of the nations as you want to. Only the person who invested the most into a country determines the path of that nation. This method is bound for several role changes throughout the game. Since one is very likely to have invested into severals countries it is quite suspenseful to see what kind of destiny others choose for a nation you are also involved in. Terrific game! Everyone in the group loved it.

Not a bad game, just not really my type of game. It's mainly about investing in different countries and whoever has invested the most into each one gets to try to manipulate it into being worth more money by the end of the game. I see how it could be rewarding after a lot of plays and you start to really understand the strategy, but for me it's pretty bland and I don't see myself every playing it enough to get to that level.

The highlight of BGG.con for me.  I got to play twice and it was relatively "easy" to learn but really, really deep.  Felt like I was playing a Euro and a Wargame at the same time.  Lots of player interaction, little downtime (except when one person is pondering purchase of bonds).  A brilliant design and damn fun to play.  Might have a bug or two to work out in future plays, and I need to digest why I came in second-to-last everytime -- what're the right strategies?

A really fantastic game that can be made or broken by the people you play it with.  It looks like a territory acquisition game, but it's easy to focus too much on manipulating the wooden bits on the board instead of managing your finances and manipulating your "partners" to get the most out of your money.

I've played a few great games of this, and at least one where all the fun was sucked out by slow min-maxing.  I guess that's one of my pet peeves - though I'm often wont to crunch values myself before making a decision on a course of action, I'm pretty impatient about waiting around while others do the same.  (see [gameid=47] and [gameid=26990])

This rating could change if I can ever get the game out.

The rules are actually pretty easy to teach, but the strategies are very hard to get your head wrapped around.  It would probably take a half dozen games to not feel like you are flying by the seat of your pants and that might be an unattainable number for me to get people to commit to.

That said if you can get a group of people over the hump I could see this being an extremely interesting game.

If you like the subject matter I can see your enjoyment of this game going up, there is a very nice little historical background included in the game.

Upgraded after playing with no imperial card and 4 players, loved it.
This game is quite unique to me. First timers will find it challenging to not think of themselves as "being a country".  You invest and improve to raise your share value and lower others, in part by military might.  But you win or lose based on half a dozen key purchases of "investments".  Talking with a GM who led 7 back-to-back games at Strategicon and observing 2 games I have a huge respect for the mechanics the game provides you, including the ability to stop otherwise runaway leaders in their tracks.

RATING: 7.5
Diplomacy with a twist that one bids in "shares" of individual countries, so that the flag representing control of a country will shift to the plurality shareholder over the course of the game.  The main flaw is that the last twelve moves or so are essentially forced, and the game devolves into basic accounting after the middle-game -- which can become painfully obvious if one of your six players announces that he wants the other players to select his move for him towards the end.  But the interaction in the early and middle games make it worth it, and it's an excellent six-player game.  Rulebook is poorly designed.

I have finally found a third game that I'm rating a 10.  There is just so much going on here that is fun and intriguing -- changing alliances, military decisions, purchase decisions.  Every game is different, even if starting positions are similar.  I want to play this again and again.

Update -- have now played without the Investor Card.  I had my doubts, but they are gone.  It is indeed even better without the card.

Another update -- tried it once with 6 players.  Not recommended.  It becomes much more a wargame with each player controlling one country and only minimal ability to steal control back and forth.

One play - ranking is highly tentative. I'm still figuring out this game.  I am still pushing different buttons to see what they do.  From what I see so far, it seems like you need to mix it up with everyone, and be coinvested in everything.  Thats very cool.  I also like how the game handles pretty much everything.  The downtime between turns was a bit much in the game I played, but not so much on the countries turn, but the brain burn occurred during the stock phase.  If familiarity can speed up the game, this should rise no problem.  Time and more plays will tell.

I prefer 2030 to this game, but they are so similar it doesn't matter much.

What a fantastic game!  It dramatically improves upon its predecessor Antike by employing the same Rondel mechanic but implementing it in a significantly better game.  The notion of everyone investing in any of the six Great Powers of Europe, and the largest investor at any one time being able to control the actions of that country is very innovative and clever.  The game seems to constantly be in flux as people shift around who they control and what their short-term goals are, but in a good way because it keeps you constantly engaged and interested whether or not it's your turn.  I really look forward to playing again and may pick up a copy at some point.

Kind of like 1856 meets Risk which kind of sounds like more work than fun to me.

Just remember, you don't have to own the best country, just lots of stock in most of the best countries.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very enjoyable game. I think the rondel mechanism works very well with the stock-market-like control of countries. I also like very much that there is no way to ditch a bond in a country you have bought -- pick your horses carefully. I think a key idea is return on investment -- you want to be sure that your purchases pay dividends out to you before you see the Investor card again, so be wary of buying more stock in the country that just hit Investor. The dynamic start is definitely preferred. It allows the players' initial perception of countries' prospects to play more of a role, as well as allowing players to make plays for controlling two adjacent countries (generally a powerful strategy). I think it's certainly appropriate for more experienced players, but I don't think there's so much to choose between the countries that agamer with no Imperial experience would be hugely disadvantaged; it's more a question of the dynamics leading to certain countries being big or small, than of some countries being inherently better. (Although I do think that Britain may have a bit of a leg up if it chooses to gothe build-many-factories and be peaceful route.) 

Potential for 10-status if I can get enough plays in.

Imperial is above and beyond Antike. Great Game, always exciting, great concept, superb components. It gets a 10 !!!

Got this to see if it was Princes of the Renaissance "done right" (i.e. more control over what your actions do) and to see if the Rondel is of interest.

...Finally played this. It's a commodity speculation game where the commodities are six of the seven Diplomacy countries (no Turkey). It has no luck, and definitely choices seem more meaningful than in PotR.

The Rondel in fact is not too bad. I thought I might not like it because I'm used to the collective Rondel of Santiago de Cuba, where players move the same token and this is a source of interaction. In Imperial everyone has their own marker on the Rondel and there is no interaction there, but the actions you take are quite interactive (whereas in SdC you're probably just converting cubes), so it's a wash.

My main thoughts are that the game is too long, and the "narrative" from a play-through seems arbitrary or incoherent (hard to summarize and explain what was happening). What you actually do to play is simple, but it takes a long time to think through moves and evaluate where players stand.

The game makes me want to design a variant with the same skeleton but even simpler details. When I'm playing, I'm quite interested to see what will happen, but it seems to take so long to get there.

RATING: 8
Played with five and was fine in length

This was a very intriguing game where your impulse is to play risk and attack/control a country the entire time....but then you notice that you don't necessarily want to ultimately control everything - but more or less be behind the scenes in multiple countries as they work their way up the track.

Love it I think - need another play.  I believe our group really enjoyed it...light bulbs appeared over each of our heads as understanding of the true strategy began to evolve

Was also nice to have someone teach the game instead of trying to learn it from the rules :-) (thanks Brian)

I think I may like this a bit more than Navigador...but it seemed the choices in Navigador were more tough (i.e. never got the move I wanted, which was a lot of fun)

Definitely need and want to play both more -

The game is so weird! Since you don't actually own anything yourself, it's tough to gauge what is good to do, whether helping a country is actually going to help you in the long run. How much should be done on the map? How much should you care about what money is in a country's bank? I was at a loss for strategy in the first game, and after it ended I still didn't quite know what to do - I performed very well, somehow, and I don't know how.

Maybe as good as chicago express.  The rondel seems like a distraction and the endgame becomes scripted (the last few turns are final investments and taxing to end the game, in which only a few players have other things to do, most players know their moves at this point) but everything to that point is hard to value just the way I like it.  Shared incentives, map play, easy combat (1:1) and stealing control of nations away from other players and managing your money.  I love the theme and the art.  I love rushing to get land early.  This game is a marvel.

I'm not sure if the endgame is scripted.  You will try to get the last few turns done quickly to end the game on your own turns, but the board position is still relevant.

Straight in with a 9.  Very clever game.  For me had lots of the feelings of a Civ game - what you gain by battle can equally be got by tax, and having a large army doesn't necessarily help.  Using two countries in an alliance for a turn is a neat trick, but knowing when to bail out of a country and let someone else take over is the key.

I loved this.  May even get to somewhere near the coveted 10, but needs more plays to make sure I'm right about it.  It was, though, the most refreshing game I've played for some time.

RATING: 6.5
Rating based on two games with five players. Be warned, this game should not be compared to Antike at all. Where Antike can be compared to any "light Civ" game, Imperial feels like a crossover between 1830 and specifically Mare Nostrum. It feels most like 1830 though. In addition, although both games are not too difficult to explain, Antike's rules are still easier to grasp, turns are still a bit quicker and gametime is probably a little less as well. With a bit more of a gamer's crowd, however, Imperial is much more cut-throat and offers even more strategies for winning. The game requires strategic as well as tactical decisions.
UPDATE: I have a serious issue with the very limited number of times you can react to a changed situation on the board by purchasing new bonds. Too bad.

I love this game an awful lot, but it's a love that continues to fade with more plays. The game feels entirely too long for what it is. Every turn is fast, every action is interesting, and the strategic considerations are always interesting, but at 2+ hours every single game, I'm having a hard time maintaining my interest.

I've thus far avoided using the "no investor card" variant on account of having new players ever game, but I think the time has come to give it a whirl and see if it helps re-invigorate my love for it.

This is nothing like Antike after all.  The rondel is still used to select actions, and there are armies involved, but this game is much more about economics than conquest.  It is something like a combination between Antike and Acquire. 

Countries don't belong to any player and you can be left without a country.  I wonder how possible it is for someone to be completely shut out and what that will do to people's opinions.

It is a very good game, and not that complex to play, but the strategy is tough to get a handle on after one play.  I am not sure how good it would be for a group that isn't willing to stick to and explore one game for a while.

RATING: 7.5
Bizarre game for 2-4 with a WWI Europe setting. Players control various countries, but with a level of indirection: they are investors, meaning that control of countries can change and that somebody can win by having the best portfolio even without controlling any countries! No luck as such.

Update: After 8 plays, with and without the investor card, my issues with Imperial have overtaken my interest in it. Your success in the game is determined too much by turn order and timing issues, and the whims of other players.

Imperial is one of the least satisfying games that I am most willing to play. It's such a great concept and is so full of interesting parts, but seems to always have problems and frustrating elements. I think basically the stock-purchasing decisions are too constrained for a stock game. You are limited to the available bonds, you only get to invest every once in a while, and you may not sell bonds. I also don't like so much the end-game taxation rush and that not everyone gets to invest at the end of the game.

After many games with the investor card, we tried one without it and, while promising at first, it ended up having its own problematic issues.

Feels like a bit of a rollercoaster ride. You're never in control, you never know what comes next. There are some really interesting opportunities and challenges related to changing the course of the game by altering the strategic course of a nation. Even one that is that on the other side of the map compared to the ones you are/will be heavily invested in, to create a ripple effect. As the game races towards the end and rondel moves accelerate, board state becomes almost irrelevant, but occupying factories to slow down taxation remains an option.
 
Conflict between Great Britain and France in the Channel is pretty hard to avoid. Perhaps too hard.

I'm kind of conflicted on Imperial. It's always great fun to play and I really enjoy the experience of playing it. That said I have never been convinced that it rewards tactical or strategic thought. In nearly all the games I've played the winner of the game doesn't seem to necessarily correlate to who we thought invested the smartest or controlled the nations the owned the best. I haven't even understand stood why I've won the games I have. I still rate Imperial very highly because of how much fun I have playing a game where control of nations is so chaotic leads to such fast and furious game play where players not only compete as nations but also for control of those nations.

Bond values are static without a demand-based market in which to buy them ( or determine prices), long stretches where some players are inactive and bored, and personally, I don't enjoy the gameplay even when controlling a nation. It's a light war game that players are only invited to participate in if they succeed at the poorly implemented investment game that dominates the proceedings

Insist on playing without the investor variant. I love the depraved and sadly all too realistic theme. Although it may indicate a certain lack of compassion on my part, I like that an ill-advised purchase on the first round means you lose and don't even get to play.

Fantastic.  Holds my attention from start to finish like few other games manage.  Unlike [gameid=19600], whose use of the rondel feels a little bit unpolished, this time around the rondel provides some very tense decisions.  Love the tactical puzzles that this game provides, coupled with the necessity of ignoring position on the board to make sure that you're still getting your money's worth out of the country.  Fine balance between stripping the country of too many resources, and making it too flush and powerful and sinking too many resources into it without payback.  There's a tension that is palpable in the room when this game comes out.  The threat of direct conflict casts a shadow, and there's lots of number-crunching that leads to a very heavy, engaging atmosphere.  It doesn't bother me, but if you like your games lighthearted, approach with caution.  If you have issues with one or more players getting shut out of play by losing their last nation and not having any spare cash to buy back into the lead in anything I would suggest using the Swiss Bank and no Investor card variants.  The Swiss Bank variant gets people who are out of the game back in, and taking away the Investor card takes away the possibility of the Swiss Bank winning by hoovering up all the small bonds while the other players all sit helpless.  And, if you are curious, I prefer this original to [gameid=54138], as the fewer neutrals and different power gaining track feels tighter.

2008-06-22 - Finally played this for the first time since I got it; a bit more than a year! What an absolute gem of a game.

War-finance game, where finance is most likely more important than the war. Rondel mechanic is included and it works well. I like the game, but it is quite lengthy and end-game might get very slow, when players paralyze when they are supposed to make their moves.

Based on my one game experience on the 18xx genre, this game has lots of similar elements.

Paper money is not the fastest option, but because the player money is secret, it might be the best option anyway.

RATING: 6
It looks like Risk but it's actually more like Acquire. I played with 6 which is probably the best way to go although I'm told 5 works well also. There are 6 countries and each one takes a turn in order. The player who "controls" that country when its turn comes up is the person who makes the decision as to what that country will do; tax, invest, build a factory, produce armies/ships, maneuver/attack with armies and ships, import armies. The "controller" is the person with the most bonds in that country. Bonds are purchased during the investment phase and victory points are accumalted during the taxation phase. The game ends when a country hits 25 points. Victory points are multiplied by bonds owned   money in hand. Our game was run by someone very familiar with the game and a player who had played only once before. The other 4 were newbs. The game took over 4 hours. I would think with experienced players the game would clock in around 2.5 hours. There is a lot of game in that time. A lot of negotiating as well which I'm not a huge fan of. I finished 18 points behind the victor (our teacher) and only 4 points behind 2nd place. The person who had played once before finished 5th. I would definitely try this again and reevaluate my rating. *Update 1/15/09* With the new BGG 'plays best with' poll it shows that 6 is NOT the best way to go. 4 is optimal.

Everyone praise the blessed Rondel!  It will be the greatest Euro-mechanism since role selection!  But come on; how many times are these folks going to use that mechanism before the fanboys stop calling it revolutionary?

Regardless, this a nifty little game.  It has aspects of a wargame, an area control game, and a stock majorities game, and since it's a perfect-information game, it's going to be everyone's darling.  I didn't quite grok it my first time playing it, but still managed to win my second game (which, I believe, came as a surprise to everyone).  It's a weird blend of mechanisms that, oddly, reminds me of Wabash Cannonball.

RATING: 8
Imperial is a stock market game where you are investing in various WWI era nations, capitalizing on their wars and then investing somewhere else when your favored nation starts to run out of steam. It takes a bit to figure out exactly what you are supposed to be doing, but once everyone puzzles out the rhythm of expansion and exploitation, the game takes off. 

Understanding that pattern makes the reasons for war become more clear. Players start to anticipate when a nation is going to cash in on its holdings, or when a nation's controller is about to cash out the treasury. Once everyone at the table connects those dots, the game becomes a pressure cooker as you try to skim as much money as possible without setting up your opponents to do the same. There is absolutely nothing else like it in my collection, nor is there really anything else like it in the war game arena.

It's a stone cold classic.

This is a downright elegant game, probably my favorite economic game. I love that it masquerades as a war game (even though it does make it difficult to explain, especially to Risk/A&A/Diplomacy players) but it's really not. The Rondel is a great way to determine actions. It's quite a challenge to figure out optimal moves, in a very good way. I can see this appealing to the vast majority of hobby gamers, and would encourage anyone to give it a try.

RATING: 8
A cynical game where players are cast as a Gnome of Zürich in old Europe and political influence is a salable commodity.  The player with the most political influence in a nation controls the nation's foreign and domestic policy:  build and deploy armies/navies, build factories, wage war, collect taxes, and/or collect tribute.  The game can feel a bit like musical chairs in regards to control of nations.  Sometimes a player controls multiple nations, other times they control none.  The player who most heavily invested in the winningest nations and avoided the losers is victorious.

Selecting a nation's action via the Rondel feels satisfying and keeps the game moving.  Despite much of the mechanics being fairly straightforward, a winning strategy is tough to craft.  What makes it tough for me is that control of any nation is rarely firm and it's the nations that take turns, not the players themselves.  Also, scoring happens only at the conclusion which makes it tougher to gauge one's standing during play.

This game is very good.  Played with 3 at Essen 06 and its' an Antike meets Diplomacy game of financial investing.  The mechanism is brilliant and the game will scale well with 3-6 players as control of countries continuously shifts to the highest investor.  This one is my choice of Gamer's Game from the Essen 06 releases.  There is less war in this than Antike but the game will likely take a full 3 hours with 6 players.

Still have no real idea how to play.

Neat idea - a risk/antike war game as the basis for a stock market.  Wow...this game hurts my mind.   I still think paying out is important,  but max taxation is important too just to get the credit going. Not sure if I like the investor card mechanic,  or whether losing control of all countries won't kill your chances - having no income at that point other than payouts seems potentially killer,  and is just plain boring.  Preliminary rating.

It's a very good game where it is not linear and clear to know where your interestes really lie.

The mechanics are fantastic and it calls for more and more plays to understand all the possibilites you have to win and what you really need to do to achieve victory
Very good and abundant components.

Economisch gedreven games zijn uiteindelijk niet helemaal mijn pakkie aan (Kijk maar naar Power Grid). Hier toch leuke combinatie gevonden tussen economie en direct conflict.

Spelers zijn investeerders die hun geld stoppen in de europese grootmachten van voor de eerste wereldoorlog. Diegene die het meest heeft geïnvesteerd in een land trekt ook daadwerkelijk aan de touwtjes in dat land. De spelers voeren dan acties uit die aangegeven staan op een rondel en bestaan uit belasting innen of troepen maken of troepen bewegen e.d.. De speler die zijn geld het best heeft gëinvesteerd wint het spel.

Rotating the ownership of countries is a killer idea. However, being stuck without any country at all is a bummer, unless you think it's good strategy and you're just breaking the game's inherent fun.

Still, definitely a game I would play again (and I am glad I played it with the correct rules after my initial flawed play). Probably better with 4, although 3 or 5 work as well.

This is a beast of a game that makes it very difficult to analize. There is a wargame on the board, and an investment game around the board. And with all the things going on, it's very hard to focus on what's important.

Great game for 6. Latest game got well and truly hammered after starting with Austria.conflict with Russia prevented attacks into the med to threaten Italy.italy eventually built up quite a lead after laying flags in Africa and racing around the board to keep taxing to raise the share price.

I find the theme cynical and depressing.  The game is otherwise very interesting.  Managing your investments while managing the mostly military affairs of the countries that you are investing in is very engaging.  It looks like a war game.  It can be tempting to play it like a war game.  It has war elements but it is really an investment game like Acquire or Owners Choice.

Many of the intricacies of 18xx without the cash route counting spreadsheet problems (that make 18xx better suited for a computer). So far this one has been quite an interactive puzzle to understand.

This game just gets better with every play. We play with an auction of shares at the start of the game (as per rules variant) rather than the random initial distribution, and we do use the investor card.

This game feels like Antike and an 18xx game made sweet love and had a beautiful baby boy.  

**The game is much better when played with the optional bidding to claim starting bonds.**

**even better when played without the investor card**

(Trade Interest: medium, offervalue:35) i have never played Antike, but i have seen a video playthrough, and read the rules.  this seems seems like a more streamlined version of that.  there is a similar mechanic of the action rondel, which is innovative and useful.  also, both games seem to present themselves as a wargame, but then you find out that they don't really reward the wargame mentality of crushing your enemies. i would play again, even though i lost pretty badly.

Only "problem" with game is it's pretty chaotic with new players. It's very heavyweight strategygame which take several games before you start to get the picture.

RATING: 8
Very impressed. I love the quasi-combination of wargame, diplomacy and stock exchange. Novel elements blend together well to create a game with familiar elements that still feels fresh and engaging. I actually like the Investor rules as written (so far) and don't see the appeal of removing it -- making the control of countries more static seems to undermine part of the game's novelty and appeal. 

What keeps this from being higher is the arduous endgame, where 1 of X different players/countries could end the game -- so it's necessary to count up points based on several different ending scenarios to see what the best move is... This can take a very long time, artifically dragging out the end of what is otherwise a brisk, tense game.

Also, having played with and without the investor card, I simply cannot imagine why some people prefer to play without the card - the added time alone should discourage people from that variant... not to mention the stale, static progress of the game. Oh, and never ever ever every play where you can simply grab $1 from the bank if you have no flags - it completely encourages the first player to lose control of a country to run the bank dry and purchase 2nd place in each country...

Grandísimo juego con rondel. Para una buena sesión jugona.

RATING: 10
+: quite easy to learn the rules (not to master the game!)
+: solid gamers-only strategy game
+: unique
+: area movement simply appeals to me (more than Hamburgum and Princes of Macchu Picchu)
+: little randomness (except for player order (bid?))
+: several officially promoted free (!) variants
+: predict the choices of other players
+: very flexible number of players
+: playable in 1-1.5 hours at BSW (vs. tough players)
-?: winning potential can depend a bit on player chaos. Player movement on rondel affects when you can buy, and how rich you are at that time. 
-?: 'winning' without controlling is a real (and boring) possibility! (tentative)
-: poses a steep learning curve: winning condition can appear counterintuitive during first plays (money, not domination)
-: runaway leader possibility so you can be "out of the game" if you played poorly (or got unlucky) and may need to sit it out. Good players will then do some leaderbashing.
-: when others have AP :-(

I didn't think I'd like Imperial despite liking Antike as the idea of losing "my" civilization didn't appeal to me.  It turns out that a stock holding game crossed with a wargame is totally brilliant and I ordered my own copy as soon as I got home from the Con where I first played... and only waited that long since nobody had a copy in the vendor hall!

Trying to invest in the countries best positioned for success is really interesting as is figuring out the best way to be successful with the countries you are running.  Do you roll over and let something else you are heavily invested in steal the one your runnings points?  Or do you invest heavily in yourself and keep your empire running strong?  Or gain control of a couple countries and do mutually beneficial things?  The fluid nature of the game is very interesting and unique and I'm looking forward to exploring Imperial a lot more!

Finally a rondel game that I can appreciate.  However, it wasn't because of the signature mechanism, but rather the clever use of the limited investing, as well as the unpredictability of the country ownership, which really made the difference for me.  Unlike Antike, which I found incredibly lacking due to its endgame being reduced to a arms race to squeeze out those last few VP needed to win the game, the military aspect in Imperial is much better implemented in comparison.  The agony in the decision of which nation to invest in; of weighing current vs. future prospects; of whether to consolidate your control or to jump ship to a more lucrative target.  These are the choices that make the game wrought with tension and fun.

FINALLY got a chance to play this at Origins 2008.  Wow.  What an awesome system.  Strips and streamlines an 18XX-type of game and distills it down to 2 hours, with direct conflict as a means to an end (but not the end itself).  Very open-ended.  A tentative 8, with a chance to go up.

It seems a mix between Diplomacy and 1830. Things change a lot during the game and you understand who is winning only at the end. It isn't a simulation game.

RATING: 5
Well-designed, well-developed.  The tax system feels very balanced to me and the rondel is simple and intuitive and ordered well.  

I think the board needs to be bigger or the bits need to be smaller; it gets so cluttered you can't tell what's where.

I'm not generally a fan of stock games.  Imperial offers nothing to change my feeling on this.

"Don't get attached to any particular country" seems to be the advice for newbies, bah! Give me my loyal legions and a stand up fight! Perhaps this might grow on me, I might even ask for it over some of the titles that get played in my group as the lesser of two evils.

RATING: 10
If there ever was a perfect and 100% streamlined strategic design... Risk, Monopoly and Diplomacy as they should've been from the beginning – blended into perfection. I elaborated my opinion in thorough here: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1272624/review-croatian-recenzija-igre-na-hrvatskom-jeziku
but it's in Croatian :-D
I lowered the grade to 9 recently because my group was more than once frustrated with "forcing option" (as we call it) on rondel and the option was made more expensive in other rondel games so designer himself obviously thought it should have been the same with Imperial, but after some thought – this one deserves perfect 10 – and for long it was my only 10 (Here I Stand got it more as a 10 experience than as a 10 game). It has its beginning, development and endgame and when to start an endgame, when to start "forcing" is entirely up to your judgment. That justifies "forcing" for me. 

Constantly replayed.

What a difficult game to get your hands around.  This game simply is complexing but I think that is one reason I so enjoy it.  The stock verses conflict mechanism is what I think makes this game great.  The game has conflict but it is not the primary goal and even battles one player may win could hurt the same player in the long run.  The roundel is also a great mechanic.

RATING: 5
After 2+ Plays: I like the rondel mechanism, but I had the same problem with this as I did with 18xx.  It feels like a stock game, and so while the actions on the board are secondary, they still take up most of the playing time.  If I'm going to play a game about manipulating stocks, I'd prefer to focus my energies on that aspect and not on a very complicated board situation that only really matters in how it changes stock prices.  If that makes any sense to you, and you want to try an investing game with more focus on the investing, try [gameid=5] or [gameid=94].

Advanced Diplomacy (albeit with no diplomace and an economic game instead). It is a Euro game, based on the fact that it could easily have been a rail game instead (or whatever). It is a relatively straightforward game with some interesting mechanics.

Very nice game - it starts slowly but picks up pace fast in the end. You have to willing to spend some hours with this game. It was a bit confusing for some of us to let go of the Risk-like thinking that a country you control is "yours".
Played it with 5, would love to give it a try with less but will also play it again with 5 or even 6 players!

Very neat investor dynamic, but can overwhelm with its dry calculating nature. Certain countries seem to be type-cast as whipping boys. (Not a balance problem per se, since ownership changes, but reduces variety.)

A fun Diplomacy-lite with stock trading mechanics. It's non-random and quite engaging, but it gets old after about a half dozen plays.

The downtime if you don't have a country can also be pretty horrible.

I have only played this once so far and while the game was fun everyone I was playing with including me seems to think that some aspects of the game do not fit well with the setting of the game.  My thought is if the game was placed in another setting something not well known to the players ( an interplanetary game with investments in the tech of the different peoples instead of there governments. for instance )that I would not have had as much trouble with the game mechanics.

[I]tl;dr - Boss Monster was a surprisingly quick and entertaining game. If you're into old video games and sweet 8-bit graphics though, Boss Monster is a good one for you to sink your teeth into.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

In Boss Monster, you play as the boss of a dungeon, trying to keep pesky heroes out. You'll accomplish this by playing different Rooms from your hands that they will have to pass through, each sapping a small bit of their health. You can also play one-time Spells that will buff a particular room or even hurt other players' dungeon. If a hero makes it all the way through your dungeon, they wound you by the amount on their card -- if you take enough wounds, you are out of the game. If they fail to make it through your dungeon, [I]they[/I] die and their card is put underneath yours as a Soul (most heroes are worth one Soul, others are worth two). Souls are essentially VP, as you need ten to win. 

You will attract heroes by the icons in each room of your dungeon -- if you have the most icons of a certain type, you will attract all the heroes of that type until someone surpasses you. Knowing what to specialize in and who to attract is a solid part of the strategy of this game -- you will need to look at the available heroes but also at what your opponents are doing. 

This game played great with 4 and didn't overstay its welcome, but I could see how people might like something heavier.

I love the theme and the art of this game.  The over-powering element of randomness takes away from it, for me.  The kids really like it, but so far I am not enamored and do not know if this relationship will last.

RATING: 6
It is thematic and very easy to play. My biggest concern is it might be overly simplistic and lack variety. It pretty much (but not entirely) hangs on the theme. But it is fast, fun and friendly. A good different feeling filler that I want to explore just a bit more. If the card combination comes in sufficiently, it might be nice. I like it a bit, but don't love it and suspect it will fall out of my collection at some point.

Suffers a bit from Munchkin syndrome that as soon as someone gets close to winning everyone piles on and the person who wins is the first person who can't be stopped. Also a heavy amount of luck involved in this with card synergy and which monsters come out at which time. A light filler that takes just a little too long.

This is an 8 bit card game that I imagine is very successful to the same sort of gamers that are big into munchkin and or love the 8 bit look. I wanted it to be more than it was. Ultimately, the next time I want a reminder of how hideous video games used to look before modern graphics I will download something from the App Store and play it for five minutes and 30 less dollars and then go back to modern eyegasm inducing ones on my modern game consoles.

My daughter picked-up this game at the game store.  Theme and art looked great so I decided to buy it for her.

The humor factor turned out to be amusing at first but was soon overshadowed by the gameplay.
Almost everything in this game is about luck.

Still, my daughter likes it so I rate it a little higher than I normally would.

I was not a KS backer for this game. It's fun, but gets a little repetitive. Maybe that would be different in games with more than 2 people. Some people have told me that the first expansion changes up the dynamics a bit and makes the heroes a little more of a challenge.

This little guy really surprised me. A friend unexpectedly gifted me with it when I'd been on the fence about it for some months. A video gamer since the Atari and NES days, I of course loved the art and game box, but wasn't sure how compelling the gameplay would be. It's actually a ton of fun. It distills the idea of building and running a dungeon down beautifully, and the stand-alone expansion only adds to the fun. I'd recommend them both together, or just the first edition. The expansion on its own doesn't quite enable enough spell usage but does up the player-versus-player side.

Normally I stay away from games that cause a lot of introspection and little interaction between players. This game could be like that, but I found so much fun in watching how the other player built his dungeons that I didn't mind. As aforementioned, the expansion increases the opportunities to interact with one another, so if that's important, I definitely recommend it.

Positives
- Easy to learn and plays fast
- Clever design and fun decisions in how to order and upgrade your rooms
- Leveling up your boss monster adds a nice layer of complexity and ability
- Terrific art, humor and pop culture references
- Nice packaging for the cards in the box

Negatives
- After several games, you'll start to get tired of the heroes that always show up-- the expansion alleviates this
- Not a lot of interaction between players and/or their dungeons

More than a little bit rubbish. This Dungeon Lords lite doesn't float my catamaran.

If it wasn't for an appealing (yet ultimately superfluous) theme I'd have run screaming after the first play. Perhaps I'm getting too old for Take That games.

As it is the second play felt extremely crap - better mechanically than munchkin but ultimately I think I'll pass on this one next time.

RATING: 3
This game has a very pretty aesthetic but offers very little in the way of depth. Most of the game is played by itself and decisions essentially boil down to playing 1 card per turn up to a certain limit, and maybe a spell or two to completely screw over your friends. The "gotcha" mechanics combined with the shallow gameplay, auto-play, and lack of any replayability makes Boss Monster a hard pass for all but the most casual and light hearted of groups.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Cute game that simulates a side-scroller. Maybe with a few more plays, more strategy will become evident, but it seems too much luck of the cards and randomness to be something I'd want to play a lot.

This is solid and has some interesting mechanics but I can't help but feel that it's lacking SOMETHING... some tiny piece of mechanic that would push this from an interesting take-that filler to something more clever.

I feel as though this game is closer to be incredible than my rating of it would suggest. I got a few plays of this in with the wife, and it just fell flat. The rooms can be somewhat cool, but it feels like once you get an engine going nothing can stop you besides the spell cards which are impossible to predict and almost impossible to counter. Too bad since the theme of the game is fantastic and I love the pixel art.

RATING: 7
A fairly fun game with some fairly fantastic cards. Seriously, it's the cards that make this.
The standard edition without any extra packs is fun the first couple of games but quickly becomes barebones. The more variety you can insert into your draw-deck, the more fun you'll have with this.

The oldschool 8-bit aesthetic makes me want to love this game so hard, but the mechanics are a not insignificant obstacle to my love. Much of the time, you will build your dungeon only to have... nothing happen. No adventurers will ever fall to their deaths in your pit! Just 1+ hours of anticlimax.

It's beautifully made but the design is lacking. Beyond the starting hand, there's almost no strategy because any new cards are top decked. The addition of a drafting, auction or open buy would make the game more strategic without lengthening it's playtime by much. Instead, it's aggressively mediocre.

Yet another attempt to interest my son in physical board/card gaming, again with little effect. This time the video game link looked like an 'in' (and it being nostalgia VG piqued my interest).

This game is fine. I enjoyed it a fair bit back in the day, but have found it a little shallow and wanting. There's a nice bit of nostalgia with the videogame cultural references, and that is enough to keep me going for a little while, but it's not a game that I see on the table anymore. 

The concept is unique and cool, but you don't really feel like the final boss at the end of the dungeon. There's a lot of luck, and the game is mostly managing the randomness that you experience. 

Like I said, this is a fine game, and I will likely play it again with the right people.

RATING: 7
UPDATE: I've played this game a lot at this point.  I love it more every time.  There are some rules that are easy to misunderstand that can be game breaking when done incorrectly. The biggest confusion for me for the first several plays was when you can build rooms on top of other rooms. When looking at the FAQ, it turns out that the only time you are restricted by the treasure type and room type is when you are building an upgrade room. The normal rooms can be built anywhere and on top of anything.  This effectively made the restrictions of destroying rooms make more sense. Thus, I love the game even more now.  It is very high on my list in terms of gameplay and theme.

UPDATE 7/11/2013: I've played this 3 times now.  It's a great mix of luck and strategy.  I finally lost on my third game.  I actually won and lost on the same round.  According to the official rules, if you get 10 souls and 5 wounds in the same turn, you do not win.  Honestly, that's what I was leaning toward before I even looked it up.  I controlled three of the four treasure types so I was kind of asking for it.  I got greedy and my dungeon was one damage short of being able to kill the 13HP epic heroes.  I'm not gong to raise my rating because there is quite a bit of luck involved in the dungeon building process, but I am firmly happy with the 8.5 I've given it.  My daughter, who played the three games with me, gave it an 8.

OLD: Love it!  I've only played it once so it was a little confusing and the instructions are hard to follow.  I had to watch a gameplay video to grasp the concepts written in the manual.  It's probably just me.  I'm expecting my score is more likely to go up rather than down with more plays.  My daughter (13) didn't want to play it with me but after our first game, she was glad she did.  It's a new hit in my house for a quick yet surprisingly strategic game.  And the artwork is awesome.

RATING: 5.5
Ok game with nice theme, but the card texts are too small to play well competitively against others. And spells have a lot of the take-that-element, so playing against others is recommended. Kind of reminds about Dungeon Lords, which is a superior game in all ways and also takes a lot more time to teach and play.

This is a fun game.  It is not one I enjoy playing often, but nongamers around me just love it.  The theme is fun, and the mechanics are easy to grasp.  Every game, there are a few meaningful decisions to be made.  It is a game I will never really want to play, but it seems to be the only game asked for when going to family functions.  As such, I will never be getting rid of this one.

Not that good. Why? Well, it is bad to play with angry gamers, some rooms are very overpowered and overall, the game doesn't really spark the imagination that much. It's a good travel game I must admit, it's as light as a feather and small enough to fit in you jacket pocket.

There is just too much luck and randomness in the cards, and the card placement and build-over restrictions just amplify the luck.  The game is cute and fairly simple, but it's primarily a "take that" and leader-bashing game that can sometimes drag on for too long.

It's a bit clunky, but it gets the right feel down. There's more strategy here than it looks like there is.

Reminds me of a Munchkin in that it's super chaotic, except I felt like I had very little control over how the game played out. The theme is awesome, the artwork superb, but the gameplay felt too chaotic and random for me (which is odd for me to say because I think Fluxx is a lot of fun!).

I'm sure more plays would reveal more ways to mitigate the chaos, but right now I have no desire to seek out playing Boss Monster again.

UPDATE: The more I've played the more I've seen that there is some strategy and tactics. I'd still never request but I don't mind playing it and can have a good time now that I can set my expectations right.

Available in many high-street stores in the UK, I was given this game as a Christmas gift - and was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Some of the cards' abilities do ruin the game in my opinion (i.e. "discard your whole hand" - which turns the game into a draw-one, play-one affair), but when the whole affair is taken with a pinch of salt the game is usually a lot of fun. The gameplay is smooth and there is an enjoyable amount of strategy and choice offered in a game that's primarily very luck dependent. However, when in the mood for something easy this one really hits the spot and, with the right group, a fun, social atmosphere.

Fun idea (after all, who hasn't dreamed of being the bad guy who takes down the hero?) and I like the idea of competing not only against your opponents to build a better dungeon but making sure that my doom factory can withstand the onslaught of heroes who desire my treasures. The problem is that I never once felt in control of my destiny. Either I drew the right card to build up my pain emporium or I didn't and watch as heroes were lured to the dungeons of my opposition. As cliche as it is to compare light "take-that!" games to Munchkin; it's apt.

I wanted to play to see what it was like and don't feel like I need to play again.

I've got the gold-sleeved edition from having backed the project on Kickstarter. 

I'm always a fan of this theme. Whatever the medium, games about building a dungeon to lure in heroes and defeat them is interesting to me. This is the first time I've seen a table-top game pull it off so well for a casual audience, however.

Other dungeon construction themed games are mostly very complicated, and while they may be fun, they usually take too long, and I would only even try to play them with my most avid board gaming friends.

Boss Monster, however, is simple enough to teach to my more casual gaming friends, but also very well balanced an entertaining.

One should note that the game can be played with only two people, but the dynamic shifts drastically. With only two players, it is much more profitable to try to screw your opponent than try to improve your own position. With three this is balanced 50/50, and with 4 players it gets weighted the other direction, so the more players in the game, the less tendency there will be for offensive plays.

Wow, given the decent ratings and volume of people that seem to enjoy this game, I was really surprised at how terrible this game was.

You play some cards to your dungeon with various symbols on them, and then heroes are attracted to the dungeon with the most of a certain symbol. At some point in the game, your dungeon is going to contain a bunch of symbols, which you can only change very very gradually, so you sit and hope the random heroes match the symbols you have.

Or, maybe you simply draw a bunch of cards, with no symbols that match, in which case you never have the majority in anything, so you never even have the opportunity to attract any heroes to begin with.

So, the game boils down to a slew of random card draws, with virtually zero decisions mattering. There are some decent ideas here, but I assume this never went through any external playtesting. I was a bit flabbergasted at how bad it is.

Enjoyed this little card game which has players building a linear dungeon and then killing heroes as they entered.  Lots of take that effects from the cards which can really throw a wrench into your plans.  It's not the deepest of games and it's very luck dependent, but it spoke to me for some reason.

I really like the idea of building a dungeon and then seeing if it survives the onslaught of the heroes. However, this game seems to be more about everyone getting to the point where they almost win, and then the other players use spells to make sure they don't. Like Munchkin, or Cosmic Encounter.

It does however get me interested in trying out Dungeon Lords.

It's a fun theme and fairly amusing, but in my experience play has been a little clunky and the winner has usually come down almost purely to luck-of-the-draw on the order of the hero cards. 
Being a pretty short game, it's fun sometimes, but I couldn't be convinced to play it if it were going to take up more than 20 minutes of my time. Granted, expansions or supplements may make it better, but I have only experienced the core game.

This isn't a 2-4 player game, it is a 3 player game.  With 2 it's too luck dependent, and the right spell will win the game out-right.  With 4 there is quite the logjam of heroes, and when that suddenly breaks the game is decided in just 1 turn.  I like how quickly a game can be played.  I recently picked up boss monster 2 as well for more variance.

Watched a video review and couldn't wondering about the theme.  All the parts sounded like a typical dungeon crawl where the players take the role of the big bad evil guy at the end more than most NES games.  Collecting souls?  How about calling them lives or 1up?  The heroes are bog standard D&D classes, outside the D&D games, this wasn't a thing I remember making up a large part of the 8-bit world.  It looks like someone made a Dungeon Lord game and said, "I know 8-bit graphics the cards gamers will buy just for nostalgia."  Little hint about 8-bit drawings, there usually much easier than actual art.  That is why so many indie video games use it.

A neat (and quick) 2D dungeon level builder, populator, and adventurer-luring experience, lovingly adorned with retrotastic pixel art. Solid enough mechanics, but the adventurers could use a little more variety/funk attraction rules - as evidenced in the officially unofficial expansion offered by one of the primary artists. Such a shame those were all ignored, even in the sequel. :-/

I get the nostalgia feel to the game, and for that it is worth a play.  But the game can go through periods of doing nothing.  Everyone tied so no heroes come along.  Or if you get behind in a category, you can't catch back up.  There are also too many "take that" cards that can also cripple you when you finally get something to do.

RATING: 5
Card game where you act as the 'Boss Monster' at the end of a dungeon. You create a dungeon full of treasure to lure in heroes from town to try and collect 10 souls. The game is very thematic, the art looks great and is reminiscent of old-school console games. 

I think this game plays best with only two players because it removes a number of issues (Such as dying early and then waiting for others to finish the game) and can make the strategic decisions more worthwhile. Replay-ability drops after 5 or-so games. This game has a number of issues, like player elimination very early into a half an hour game, a large amount of randomness, and doing well early in the game can cause the game to snowball.

Apparently the game plays better with the Kickstarter exclusives. I guess it's my fault for not knowing about this till I saw it on a shelf?

I was drawn to this game based upon the idea from the Kickstarter. For better or for worse, $25 for a game seemed like a good deal to me. 

Upon receiving the protoype, I broke it out and played a few games with different people in 1-on-1. My general feeling is that it is a nice and simple filler game with a great theme.

The artwork is great, and the references make for some fun conversation while playing. The mechanics are simple: Place rooms, lure adventurers. Placement is important, and even though you can play over cards, figuring out the order of your rooms is a key element. It has a strong luck of the draw element, but as it plays in 30 mins or less, upsets and odd draws are part of the fun. Overall I think it is a great game to play at the beginning of a game night as a nice way to kick things off, especially if not everyone is well acquainted. The strong nostalgia element has a way of bringing gamers from all backgrounds together for some fun.

A unique twist of a tower defense game in card form where you're building your dungeon up into a powerful trap that can attract heroes to kill.  A lot to balance is needed in forming your dungeon, if you go pure damage rooms, odds are you probably won't be able to bait heroes in the town to even come in because high damage rooms rarely have the best loot, if you have too much of a single treasure type, you might never find enough of those types of heroes coming to your dungeon (because of luck of the draw and stalemating opponent players), or maybe you want to play survivor and spell caster - seeking victory by sending powerful heroes to your opponent and sabotaging their dungeon - leaving you last boss standing!.  Many options keeps gameplay fresh, and luck of the card draw on heroes and rooms makes you have to create and re-create your dungeon on the fly.  The only real downsides are that the play area can get a bit chaotic when the town keeps filling up and once you've played a half dozen or so times - you'll figure out your dungeon strategy.  The expansions and sequel remedy that, however.

This game has an awesome theme and great artwork (who doesn't want to play as a dungeon lord and defeat pixelated heroes?). 

The basic gameplay is straight forward. You build your dungeon - lure heroes into it and then try to defeat them, all the time casting spells and setting off traps which may hurt your opponents. 

If you get the right cards and play them correctly, you can build some powerful combinations, so there is a reasonable luck element to the game (although you still have to plan well to take advantage of it). 

The game appears to suffer from a fair amount of ambiguity in the rules, particularly around when cards can be played and/or activated. This could have been relatively easily resolved through some additional effort by defining when cards can and can't be played and activated (for example using some simple iconography on the cards). This drags the game down somewhat, however the theme, artwork and general gameplay makes it 7.5/10 for me.

GAMEPLAY: :star::star::star::nostar::nostar: 
This is quite a unique game but does come down to quite a bit of luck as to what cards you draw and which heroes come out but a fun little game none the less.
 
AESTHETICS: :star::star::star::star::nostar:
I love the 8-bit art style in this game and there are some really cool spoof characters in the Hero deck!

RULES & TEACHING: :star::star::star::star::nostar:
Pretty simple to learn and teach. Rulebook is larger than needed due to a lot of art but it also comes with a quick start guide which is really handy.

RATING: 7.5
A fun twist of a game. Players take control of different boss monsters who's objective is to not only lure the heros into their lair, but smite them as well. How do you do that? By building a dungeon! Each room card has different symbols that are likely to attract different types of heros, meaning bosses will either compete for some types while others may monopolize a certain hero type.

The art is done in a pixel style that feel like a love letter to 80's style gaming. Many cards also have little nods to some pop culture things like a few cards nodding to Harry Potter, Magic: The Gathering, Evil Dead, Indiana Jones, etc. 

It's a great little game with some expansions out now to keep things fresh with more bosses, more heros, and even more treacherous rooms. Cheap enough financially to justify owning even just the base game. No regrets with this purchase.

My first time playing this game I was disappointed. I felt completely helpless, and as Tom Vasel said during his review, "...it feels like the game is playing you." I adore the theme, as it reminds me of all the hours spent playing my old NES as a child, so my girlfriend and I gave this another shot. The second time wasn't quite so bad... the third time we actually quite enjoyed it. 
Once you understand that you have to make strategic decisions based off of a *balance* of room abilites, advanced rooms, and "instant kill" rooms, and also have to surrender to a bit of luck, then you can learn to really enjoy this game.

Why I got rid of it : I kinda think 8 bit art is lame.  So if you take away the art style and then get over the idea that you play the dungeon (which was novel) You are left with a so so card game that does not seem to day anything special from a mechanics perspective.  The game works and there is nothing wrong with it.

Bought this game on a whim because of the artwork.  The art is fantastic but the game mechanics are broken.  It's essentially a card game where everything is super random.  There's also take that gameplay and player elimination.  You really have no control over how you build your dungeon (unlike games like Race for the Galaxy which allow you to draw TONS of cards throughout the game so you can shape your strategy).  With Boss Monster you just go with the flow and hope for the best. Overall a game I was very disappointed with.  I would recommend this game to fans of Munchkin.

RATING: 6
For a quick filler game, this made me want to think an awful lot, due to interactions between room powers and the cross-cutting incentives of "luring or avoiding heroes [perhaps of particular types]" vs. "doing damage". This makes the game much [i]more[/i] appealing to me overall, but much [i]less[/i] appealing as quick filler (which is what it seems to be sold as) - an odd combination.

My only real complaint is that in mid-game, hand sizes were annoyingly large, due to drawing 2+ rooms/turn but only playing one. But it seemed like there were rooms to take advantage of that, and with experience presumably the analysis becomes easier.

Moss Bonster and its sequel are both highly entertaining, mildly unbalanced homages to 8- and 16-bit gaming.  The cards are often very funny, and the "lure" mechanic can make for some interesting scenarios as players compete to have either more or less of certain treasure types, depending on what Heroes are threatening.

If you are a fan of retro video games then this game is a must own. The theme really comes through while you are doing all you can to defeat the puny heroes trying to get to you. The gameplay is a bit lackluster and the best player will not necessarily win, but the theme really drives this game.

First impressions after one play: Cool theme, but too much randomness. I found it frustrating that I couldn't draw any Advanced rooms.

I'll admit, I spotted this at my FLGS and took the "nerd bait" so to speak, buying it on a whim. It's not a BAD game, but your starting hand can really dictate your overall experience and getting a bad hand with no synergy is frustrating. Implementing a more robust mulligan system or even a drafting phase would make the game more balanced. But, I have to rate the game as it is out of the box, which is a slightly above average filler with an appealing theme.

I have to borrow Roger Ebert's words for a moment:

Only on Kickstarter could someone be proud to claim to have "designed" this pile of shit.  This is not a game; it's a cynical ploy to combine 8-bit nostalgia with 1-bit game design in order to gain some Internet-based notoriety.

Boss Monster is a game that I played a demo of and immediately bought afterwords.  This game is great!  It's nostalgic and humorous and even if you didn't grow up with 8-bit gaming, you can still appreciate this game.  The mechanics are great and there is a good balance of strategy and luck.  The bosses that you play as are also really well balanced.

The premise of the game is to build a dungeon to keep heroes from killing you.  You play the boss at the end of the dungeon.  I love that concept, the idea of an anti-hero is very intriguing to me.  This game flows very well from start to finish and is one of my favorite games on my shelf.

Not a bad little game but the card text is too small costing it a whole point - graphic designers please, please remember that what looks perfectly readable at 400% resolution on your PC screen when doing the design is too f@&king small to read when it's printed out!!!!

Also the pixelated 'look & feel' which I can understand from a thematic point of view is difficult to read, even allowing for the size, from across the table and you need to know the values and effects of card sitting in other players dungeons and waiting in the middle.

The four player game results in what perhaps could be describes as random player collisions as opposed to considered player interaction so I would think it plays better with 2 or 3 players. 

But worth a play or two especially as it does not outstay it's welcome.

This little card game is more fun than I thought it would be. The expansion (Tools of Hero-Kind) add some flair. We home ruled the draw at the end of the turn so that if you don't collect a soul that turn you can choose to draw from the spell deck instead of the room deck. 

Fun with 2, more fun with 4.

A hand of some bunk cards can really hinder you also but it is fun trying to work out some room combos that allow you to take on the higher power characters.

Drips with awesome theme. Plays okay out of box but slightly anti-climatic. Much better if you allow player to choose to draw a room OR spell card on their turn. Encourages increased player interaction rather than just playing against the game.

I had a surprising amount of fun playing this game! Being a retro video game enthusiast this was right up my ally. The person who taught me the game didn't really have a firm grasp on all the rules so I still don't know if we played it completely correctly. Will have to give this another try and read the rules myself.

An interesting little card game that I bought from thinkgeek.com before getting into the hobby. I liked the theme and it didn't seem like a bad game. It's not to casual gamers and I still pull it out for groups that are DnD players and haven't really played board games. There are certainly a lot better games in this field but earns a solid score for its usage in getting a different type of gamer to play.

RATING: 3
The theme here is awesome; play as a dungeon boss, luring adventurers to their doom. Unfortunately, the fun stops there. Considering players compete to lure the same adventures, there is a lack of strategic flexibility, and the player interaction is fairly tame. Certain parts of the game seem tedious, and the decisions aren't as interesting as one would think. I can see why others like it, but it leaves more to be desired for me.

Boss Monster was one of the first games I purchased when I entered the Board Game Hobby (after buying Specter Ops). I was drawn in by the art style and how it immediately reminded me of classic NES gaming and aesthetics. the first couple of games I played I really enjoyed both with 2 players and then a couple of 4 player games. the challenge was finding others to play however this game also has a fantastic digital adaptation that you can download on IOS or Steam. while I thoroughly enjoy this game I am also very aware of its flaws. the methods to win this game are very limited and there are clearly over powered cards and cards that are fairly useless. you can easily lose the game because of a bad run of low value cards. ultimately it comes down to this. each hero that visits your town has a health of 4, 6, 8 and then 11,13 for the epic heroes. so if you are getting bogged down with cards that deal 1 damage there is not a lot you can do to stop from being killed. the cards are broken into room cards and spell cards. I found that the spell cards are often underused because they can be quite hard to get (unless you play a combo of specific room cards that help, however this is relying on the random draw). despite all I have said I really enjoy this game however I find that I play the digital copy more than the physical which is a shame.

RATING: 5
An amusing little filler that plays too long to truly be a filler. The early game is fun, and players stay engaged. Mid-game is dull. Endgame can be fun, but by the time my group gets there, we are already checked out. Pass, but it's fun in a cool meta way the first play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A can-be-fun with the right mind set, filler-type, card game with a retro video game theme where you are the boss (bad guy) who is building a dungeon that will attract heroes for you to slay.   

I really don't care for the random and swingy nature of the card draws.  However, it is worth having in the collection for the theme alone and does see some (very) periodic action on our table.  

(Edit: It's been over a year and a half since it's even been mentioned so I'm downgrading to a 5, this one is likely on it's way out soon.)

As a child of the 80s and early 90s I was incredibly excited about this game.  I love the concept I thought the artwork was fun... But it turns out the game was not.  In the few games I played luck tended to mitigate all strategy.  You could create an impressive and powerful dungeon, but if the heroes that come out arent drawn to it, well, no points for you.  The game goes by fast so this isn't a huge deal, but it just lacked fun and excitement. 
Great concept, theme made sense, dull game play.

The greatest strength of this game is theme. The pixelated art creates pure nostalgia to anyone who enjoyed the 8-bit era. The art design is strong in every aspect. Cards give clear visual cues and text is clear.

I did not enjoy the level of player interaction. I thought that competing to seduce heroes to our side and manipulating that process was fine. I did not enjoy attacks that disrupted the structure of my dungeon. I felt that was the core of the game and something that should not be disrupted.

Easily the most fun my wife and I have ever had gaming. When some players start scheming against the current winner, you can have some amazing moments. I've gone from one step away from winning, to being killed and another player taking the win (who previously had little chance of winning) thanks to some creative collaborative Spell use. Makes for some great OMG moments. Great intro game for newbies.

We played a coupled of time so far.

You are a boss in a dungeon, your goal is to attract champions with your goodies and then to kill them before they deal danage to you. You must gather 10 point worth of champion to win. 

 A good theme for anyone that like to play video game. 
It's a quick game; plays in 20 minute. 
 The rules are simple and it even comes with a quick rules sheet.
The Art is done in 8-bit style, not for everyone. 
  And the experience is overall very enjoyable but the game is not fleshy enough to be played an entired game night. It's a filler Game.

Interesting concept and 8-bit artwork.

You are a boss monster is a side scrolling dungeon and fend off the heroes that come wreck up the place, however gameplay itself is a little disappointing as it is very very dependent upon luck of the draw and there seems to be no way to stop a run away leader.

Played with 4 players initially.

I just wish there were more games in this style.  The art, the mechanics, everything slides into place and makes sense.  I have found this game can be unbalanced at times, however it is a lot of fun and can roll over quickly.  There are expansions, new editions, etc, and they all are better, but this game has charm.  

It is not difficult to learn, and after a couple playthroughs should fly by.  There is balance issues, there are rules that need more information, there are really long draws on resources at times.  But you'll have fun.

Edit: Boss Monster gets a little better when played with the right people.
It should be shorter, it should be a filler, but it takes more than an hour to finish.
It could be a very good game if it was shorter.

I have both Boss Monster and Boss Monster 2.  They're both basically the same game, but with different bosses and card abilities, so you can play both of them alone or throw the cards all together into one big deck and play together. 

In them, you're the boss at the end of an 8-bit side scrolling dungeon trying to stop the hero from getting to you.  You do this by playing room cards to build your dungeon.  This game pulled off the theme perfectly.

Read the directions carefully if you pick this one up, and pay close attention to terms.  I played 3 times before I realized I wasn't allowed to do something I kept doing.

I am a sucker for games with 16-bit art or a video game theme. And this one has plenty of both. The concept i  pretty fun as you are building a dungeon best equipped to kill wandering adventurers.

Maybe a little more complicated than it needs to be, but overall not a bad way to spend half an hour. I really like the 8-bit art style and the light mood. It seems to work better with more than 2 players, and it was a bigger hit with my nieces than it is with me. That's perfectly fine, though, and I'll be happy to play it with them any time they want. They like the light strategy and feel the cards give them fun choices in building their dungeons. They also like using the spells to enhance their turn, but they don't like to use them to attack other players very much; that's their tendency in all games, live and let live while still trying to win.

Light filler with area majority element to attract heroes, which become souls (VPs) if defeated, or damage if you are defeated by them. You need to build your dungeon up to defeat the heros, but you also need to attract only heroes which you can defeat. Kind of random in many ways, but ok game.

I love the pixel art and the simplicity of teaching and playing the game. At the same time, I feel like there isn't much of a deep game here, the cards don't offer a lot of variation for experimentation. It's a tactical affair, like Neuroshima Hex, Innovation, Gosu, etc. (Not quite as good as those, however...maybe about equal with Gosu.)

RATING: 7
Great theme, but the game mechanics lack a little depth and if you can't get any good engine built, then you're dead int he water.  The bright side is that it's short, so if you're okay playing quick filler where you may not have a shot at winning due to poor card drafting, this is all right.

Edited after multiple plays:  The expansion(s) add(s) a lot of variety and layers.  You can actually build some pretty nice combos and constantly changing your dungeon is imperative to keeping the line of heroes moving through.  It's great fun!

This is one of my favorite card games. First of all, I love the 8-bit art style. It is great for a 2 player game but plays best with 4 people. Really anything can happen until the last round of the game. I was surprised by the amount of cleverness/strategy used. There is a luck factor in what cards you draw, but there is defiantly a good balance thanks to the mechanics of the game. It may look geeky on the outside, but it is fun for everybody I have played with.

Fun, quick, and hilarious little card game that asks "What if you were the boss at the end of a level from the classic Mario-like games of decades ago?" Not a ton of meaningful player interaction, but what interaction there is, is enjoyable. What we have here is a goofy, solid, take-that kind of card game. Oh and did I memento the pixel art drawing from all sorts of geeky pop culture references is absolutely charming/nostalgic?

Nice production that doesn't overstay its welcome. Becomes kind of mathy once you've built your buzzsaw, and I'm not sure the "take that" gameplay is a superior alternative to just providing a random factor for dungeon resolution. Starts with plenty of promise but ends with a whimper ... it's like writing a little computer program, and then running the stack a couple times. OK, I guess.

See Boss Monster 2. This is the version I prefer for multiplayer games: splashier, more powerful cards, and easier to learn (Cards are simpler/more explicit) than Boss Monster 2. I play without the discard from your opening hand - as you would play in BM2 - and find it makes the games much smoother to start.

Same as BM2, but the balancing is a bit less tight, advanced rooms in this version can be very swingy/overpowered (The Crushinator).

Have Paper and Pixels, Tools of Hero Kind, Crash Landing.

RATING: 5
A super-light and quick card game where each player assembles a video game boss level using drawn room cards, intent on luring heroes inside, where your death traps and minions defeat them for victory points. Failure to defeat the heroes means they wound you.  Too many wounds, and you're eliminated.

Cool theme and retro 8-bit art.  Gameplay is a very simple and straightforward. There is some player interaction with the use of spell cards and clever placement of room cards, which can send some powerful heroes over to the opponent when they aren't ready.

It's an enjoyable enough filler, and fun with the kids.  Not deep enough, for my tastes, to warrant recommending at a game night.

I liked the idea and setting of the game--creating a side-scrolling video game dungeon in which to lure and kill unsuspecting heroes--but the execution fell a little flat. Perhaps my group was playing too deliberately. I think it would be better if played quickly. Also, there wasn't much interaction between the players. It was a simple enough card game, but I don't have much desire to revisit it.

Quick game that fits into a busy schedule. It's pretty bare bones, but considering how quick of a turn around it is, there's really not much to complain about.

Looks fun and definitely a great theme but the actual game itself surprisingly isn't quite what I expected, or was hoping for. Not saying that I dislike it, it's just that I personally don't find it as  in depth as I thought it would be. Despite the shortcomings in that regard it's quite straightforward to play and relatively easy to learn and teach, so should be a fairly fast paced game overall.

[NOTE for family “Father Geek” types: two of the cards might give you pause when playing with younger gamers. One is called the "Vampire Bordello," and the other is the “Succubus Spa.” Based on their content & artwork - even though pixel and cartoony - they might be cards you leave out of the deck if playing with kids]. 

A fast and very fun Munchkin-killer with a strong, funny, playful theme. 

The elevator pitch: Dungeon Lords meets Munchkin set in an 8-bit pixel side-scrolling universe that pays tribute to Super Mario Brothers.

Players are Bosses (nine to choose from, each with a different one-use variable special power) building dungeons in order to attract heroes. The dungeons work like a "tower defense" mechanism; heroes enter the gauntlet of rooms and must encounter each room of a dungeon, automatically taking damage.

Heroes that perish in the dungeon before reaching the end score points for the Bosses; heroes that survive and reach the Bosses inflict wounds. First boss to 10 points wins, 5 wounds eliminates your boss from the game. 

A great light filler and (as mentioned) preferable to Munchkin due to a shorter running time and better balance and mechanics for a beer-and-pretzels type experience. It doesn't overstay its welcome and has a brain as well as wit behind the chaos. 

I bought it at my FLGS and then later heard about its Kickstarted history. If/when it goes the Munchkin route and started releasing expansions, I'd gladly buy them.

The theme of the game, along with the art and card descriptions, are the best part of the game. The mechanics struggle at times.

I have a soft spot in my heart for this game. I love pixel art and retro game references so I love this game. However the game does suffer from some mechanic problems. The first few phases or rounds typically lead to damage to the players and there's nothing you can do about it. You just have to accept that the first round or 2 you're going to lose health. It's kind of dumb and I wish they would have figured out a way to overcome that fault. Otherwise - it's a quick, fun game to play. Art and pop culture/game references on the cards are just hilarious.

A kind of "Dungeon Keeper" as a deck-building game. The premise is great and the spoof 16-bit pixel art on the cards is fantastic. There's a fascinating tipping point to the game, where at the beginning you are trying to ensure all the heroes go to your opponent's dungeon, whereas in the later game you are trying to ensure they all come to you.

It's not a good game if you mix experienced players with first timers. The choices required in the early part of the game make the difference between winning, losing and even having a chance. I find new players feel frustrated by not knowing the cards/options available/flow of game in their first attempt, but usually want to play again and enjoy it more second time.

As I've found with many "special ability" games, not all the Boss Monster level up powers are of equal strategic value, which is a pity.

I picked this one up primarily to play with my kids.  We have a pretty good time with it when we play and generally aren't too ruthless.  I'm apparently not very good; it is not uncommon for me (or anyone I'm playing with) to get killed by adventurers.  Reading the boards, it seems most people generally get out pretty unscathed.  I honestly haven't put enough time into it to really work on better strategies, but I think that is fine.  It makes sure the kids still have a chance and still want to keep playing!

I think this game has a really novel idea, and the theme is quite unique. The problem I have with this game is it is way too luck based for my tastes, making for some incredible balance issues. Plain and simple, if you get great cards due to luck of the draw you will win. Many games will feel incredibly swingy and quite cumbersome as you watch a runaway leader just own.   

Some of the card combinations you get are extremely overpowered and broken, and that's only cause that player drew a card better than anyone else, not really based on skill. Of course someone can just wail on that player, but then it becomes another game I hate even more, Munchkin - with player elimination mind you. That's no fun for anyone.

Also a 4 player game feels like it takes too long. The box says 20 minutes but I've seen some games take about an hour. And for this game, that is way too long for what turns out to be an activity more than a game. It's not the worst but it isn't setting the bar high by any means.

Neat concept . . . feels like it falls in the same category of Munchkin - but different mechanics and MUCH shorter to play.

Boss Monster holds a special place in my heart for being the game that got me back into board games, along with many of my friends.  I saw it on Kickstarter, and it was the first Kickstarter game I bought.  In highschool, there were long hours before first period for seniors, in which my friends and I would play this, and a few custom rpgs.
My only problem with the game is that whoever builds a room that can consistently generate spells is much more likely to win the game.  And sometimes it comes down to blind luck with card draws.  But it does lead to some really good victories and defeats.

RATING: 5
Lots of theme, ultimately a standard 'play good cards on yourself, play bad cards on your opponents' game. Up from a four because there does seem to be some depth in how you build your dungeon; likely to drop with more plays as I discover that the promised depth is either absent, or completely overshadowed by the randomness of the card draw.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It definitely can suffer from some randomness, but that's to be expected from a quick card game like this. It has a fun, fairly unique theme and the sometimes competing desires to be able to kill adventurers and be able to lure them into your dungeon in the first place makes for interesting decisions. The latter desire is where a lot of the interaction comes from, where the rest comes from the spell cards and some room effects. About half of the spell cards are take that cards, and while I'm not a huge fan of that mechanic it works well enough here. Getting some combos going in your dungeon and designing it well is a big part of the fun here, but that ends up being fairly obvious and comes down to the cards you happen to get.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Pass on this one.

Good art, boring game. Draw a card, and play it. Not may choices or interactions. If the game had any other theme or art it would never sell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Quite disappointing. I was drawn to the game by the art and theme, but that wasn't enough for the game to stand on. I id enjoy the first game and the core mechanisms are interesting enough. But, there just weren't enough cards. I wanted to be surprised and excited when I got my hands on a unique room to play to my dungeon. I wanted to find creative ways to combo up cards (like in Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards), but that didn't happen. By the second game I was already familiar with most of the rooms I came across. Traded.

Boss Monster has some great art, a great theme, and a great concept - but just doesn't have the gameplay to back all that potential up.

The gameplay is very fidgety and not straightforward (that the manual was revised in a new printing and that there is a FAQ online for explaining some card interactions should be a sign). Moreover, there is rarely an interesting decision to be made. Once the cards are dealt, it is pretty easy for players to pick out the optimal card combination - assuming one exists, which frustratingly sometimes doesn't happen.

This is a game that's too heavy to be so luck dependent, making it one I have little interest in ever playing again.

Got this for my birthday, September 2016, having played it at our local board game group.  I love it!  It's pretty simple, eminently playable and full of quirky mini back stories, as well as looking like an old 80s video game in terms of art work.

RATING: 6
This SEEMS like a decent game to start a game night, maybe while waiting for one person or something. This isn't the case at all though, it takes way too long unless people are 100% aware of everything they want to do every turn. 

Honestly, the game seems a lot more fun than it is. Maybe it's the artwork or the concept. By the end of it we usually just want it to be over. I want to love it, but I don't.

Otherwise it can become quite simple.  This has proved to be a good family game and easily points out ways in which cards can work togeather

RATING: 5
2014-10-29 - I really like the idea of Boss Monster, but I'm not sure how much I love about the execution. The building of the dungeon and the special abilities of the rooms are all pretty neat and clever, but, at least with 4 people, it's possible to build the best dungeon ever, and still not be able to compete for the heroes. This is a first impression. I'll need to play it more to decide.

2017-11-06 - I think I would probably prefer not to play this game again. The theme is okay, but it's just too light for the length for me.

A fun idea, but the execution just isn't there. Each player's opening hand of cards determines their fate. Perhaps a room draft each round or a way to draw more than one room per turn would help. As it stands, it falls pretty flat.

8-bit illustrations are the charm in this card game where players lay out dungeons to attract and kill explorers. Kill ten, win the game. It's luck-based, with a knowledge of when to use the room powers to get the most advantage.

Great game with 2 or 4 players. It can get out of hand real quick. There is decent build up as people are tied and don't get heroes to their dungeon, then one person gets enough to win. Lots of balancing act in this light game.

My kid loves this one, so I have played it a lot. My initial rating was higher, but the more I play it the more I hate the mechanics. This is a game wherein your fate is very nearly 100% decided based on your card draws. If you draw the wrong kinds of rooms with the wrong kinds of treasures at the wrong times then you're not going to do well.

If anyone has some kind of mechanic fix for this to make it more fun, I would love to hear it. I feel like there is great potential for this game to be more fun and interesting, it's just not quite there.

The theme is awesome and the art is cute and funny, so it's fun as a light filler game, but not one for the serious gamer type.

CONS
theres not much of a game here, there are almost no decisions. Sure you get room cards to choose from but 90% of the time you will place the best one out. Runaway leader problem also. Your destiny is basically what you draw, whoever draws better will always win.

RATING: 5
Thematically this game is similar to Dungeon Lords. You control a dungeon and try to attract heroes and kill them. Unlike DL this is a very light game with few meaningful decisions. 

The heroes have different types (cleric, fighter, thief, ect...). You build rooms in your dungeon, which is a left to right set of at most 5 rooms. Rooms have one or two hero icons on them and each round N heroes are flipped up and they are attracted to the dungeon which has the most matching icons. So there is a set collection aspect to the game. You must have the majority of certain icons in order to attract heroes to your dungeon. This is the most frustrating part of the game because you draw 1 room from the deck each round so you have no control over which room icons you collect. Your ability to attract heroes is completely up to random luck.

As the heroes walk through your dungeon they take damage from the rooms and if they are killed before reaching the end of the dungeon you get some points, if not they deal you some damage. The game is a race to some number of points, or you can die if you take too much damage. In order to have a powerful dungeon you need to have some nice combos set up, some rooms work well together. More luck of the draw.

The game is very short, and the art and theme are well done. It has that early 1990's video game feel. If you want a fast filler with this kind of theme then it's okay but there is very little game to be found here.

This game is a mixed bag. The art is a blast, the game mechanic is too luck based with the standard rules. But this can easily be fixed with an house rule to have a common display with 3-4 room cards and 2-3 spell cards. Makes the game much better. Without this variant would never play the game again, but with it its great, especially when you have all expansions.

This is  a good game however I get annoyed at the random draw that you can have little to no control over from the start of the game and can end up quite far behind with no easy way to catch up if you don't draw it. In a game with a full compliment of players this will normally happen to one player. It is also frustrating that sometimes your opponent can pull out a win and you can do nothing to stop him because of having a bad draw for a few turns. On the plus side the game is normally over within 10 minutes so you can just shuffle up and start again. - Math Trade

Basically it is a trick taking game where you are hoping you can kill the trick and the trick doesn't defeat you. 

The game has a great look and theme. But more of an event rather than game.  Same problem as Dungeon lords.  I have not built a dungeon I built a studio apartment.

I really like this game. I didn't rate it as high as some others because it isn't very deep. There's a lot of potential for really cool dungeon combos, but they sort of missed the mark on that opportunity. Still, a really fun play, though–especially while listening to Anamanaguchi!

Wanted to like this game, and think the over all concept would still make for an amazing game. This however is not it. Balance issues, VERY random. Some rules don't seem to really make sense. Over all, a miss with my game group. 

The goal of Boss Monster is to be the first Boss to amass ten Souls, which are gained when a Hero is lured and defeated. But a player can also lose if his Boss takes five Wounds from Heroes who survive his dungeon.

I want to like this game, I really do. The concept is silly fun, the art style is bliss for an 8/16-bit gaming veteran like myself, and the gaming and nerd culture references are fun to pick out.

HOWEVER... the game itself is an anemic attempt at a clever concept. The dungeon cards don't have enough synergy to allow really clever dungeon design, the spells are overpowered and/or conditional to the point of uselessness, and the mechanic for luring heroes to you is rather broken (at least in 4-player games). The first few rounds are very dull as you all build up your dungeons and heroes form a conga-line in town.

I have a feeling that this game will become another Munchkin: more popular than it should be, exclusively due to presentation.

a decent little filler game that has one of my favorite graphic design choices, 8-Bit Graphics, and some interesting choices to make. 
Boss Monster is a pretty straight forward card game with a few take-that elements. Mostly you have a hand of dungeon rooms you are choosing to place in your dungeon that will simultaneously lure and murder hapless heroes in search of a good time. Each room will not only help you take those pesky heroes off of your hand, but will also usually confer a special ability to the Boss that has built them. And here is the real meat and potatoes of this game lies. You see as a Boss Monster you are not only concerned about how strong your rooms are that you build, but also what sort of synergies to the bring to the table, for you, the most evil and powerful one. See, even terrible things that lurk in dark dingy dungeons have to worry about corporate speak as well. 
In the end Boss Monster is a decent filler with some interesting ideas. With more expansions I can see this one being added to my collection if more meat and variances come into play. Right now though, the base game seems a little repititve with the rooms, and overall just provides a so-so experience.

Boss monster is fun, just about everyone wants to play this game when they see the box and they usually aren't disappointed. Every once in a while luck of the draw can leave you screwed, but for the most part its a balanced game that everyone enjoys.

Lots of fun conceptually, this game deliberately recalls the 8-bit era of electronic RPGs, right down to the Nintendo-cartridge packaging.  Where it tends to fall apart is the gameplay; it's a straightforward hand management game with a very simple rule set, but there's such a degree of randomness and luck of the draw that games can end pretty abruptly with your opponent unable to do much to stop you.  There's also not a huge amount of balance involved, and can lack competitiveness.

On the upside, it's really an enjoyable game, with funny text and a really nice evocation of its era -- including some nice little Easter Eggs.  The art and design are just flawless, perfect little sprites with an exact combination of nostalgia, originality, and humor.  It goes by pretty quickly, too, and can be played in a fairly limited amount of space.

This is a good light filler that forces you to balance getting enough icons to attract heroes to come to your dungeon while being able to do enough damage to defeat them, with a somewhat fresh theme (though I personally am not a fan of the art style). While I generally do not like take that mechanics, it is pretty difficult to draw the spell cards that causes the take that to be more to prevent a runaway leader rather than to wail someone down to oblivion. I wish though that there was a better to mill for the monster room cards you wanted (maybe a draw 2 keep 1?) as it can just occur that you don't have the icons to attract any of the present heroes.

EDIT: I heard that my 15 minute plays of this game can be atypical. If this game typically drags on for 45 minutes or more I would have rated it a 4.

Type: 2-4 player card-based tableau-building game with only minimal direct interaction.

Best with: 4
Weight: light
Duration: 20-30 minutes
Notes: 

Boss Monster is a game inspired by 8-bit platform video games where each player takes on the role of a dungeon boss monster, and must build a dungeon in front of them. The game is of the draw one/play one card game type. Hero cards are drawn to dungeon based on the treasure type of the dungeon, and then the player dungeons try to reduce the hero life totals to 0, claiming souls which act as victory points.

This game is a slighty bit fiddly early on as players get used to simultaneously revealing buildings, sticking to the order of play based on boss monster XP values, and adhering to the rules of how to plan and build Advanced buildings. But once those are done, the game is quite easy, fluid, simple, and quick to play. Spying on other player dungeons is pretty easy with the vivid card icons, and the art and flavor of the cards is excellent. 

There is some interaction between players provided by Spell cards, but otherwise each player is mostly left to their own dungeon-building devices.

The game is quick, and there is just enough time and meat to the game to allow for some chances at strategic play, but typically once one player gets a head by a few points, they do tend to stay ahead. However, games are quick, so things don't ever really bog down.

Similar games in my collection: Among the Stars (card-based tableau-building with minimal direct interaction with other players, and end-of-game scoring), Race for the Galaxy (tableau-building multiplayer solitaire with minimal interaction)

Rating:

Game quality: Surprise of 2013 so far. I know it is said to play better with higher numbers, but I honestly think it might work best as a 2-player game. I think the issue with higher number of players is the fact that their will be more ties when determining what hero goes to what dungeon so you could have some mass build up on heroes coming and then the flood gates open. 6.

Would I buy this again if I was starting over: Theme wise this works really well for my friends and I so the initial thought was yes. In the end, I don't think it would. There's a growing number of 2-player and multi-player games I would sub in instead. 3.

Do I want to play this if asked: Maybe, but not for long. 3.

Overall: 6.33.

This game is a huge bummer. The theme is incredible, all the classic NES references are great.

The game itself would have needed a lot more playtesting unfortunately. There's barely any interesting decisions to make, and since you want to focus on attracting specific types of NPCs, there's usually one obvious card to play during the whole dungeon building process.

The concept itself had huge potential, it's a shame it didnt meet the expectations.

RATING: 6
After 5 plays I am disappointed with what this game is compared with what it could have been - given the great concept, theme and artwork.

However, while the ruleset is expressed to be reasonably simple, there are some complex interactions between the different cards and a precise understanding of exactly when a card can be activated or played.  While a number of these have been resolved by the advanced FAQ released by the designer (which should have been included in the box), there is still a lack of clarity about precisely when abilities can be activated.  

I think in every game I have played there has been a situation where I've needed to scour the rulebook to find a general rule which might be helpful or look to the advanced FAQ (or both).  This makes the game less suitable for infrequent play, and a poor option for teaching non-gamers. 

For example, a bit more detail in the glossary regarding when cards can be destroyed would have alleviated queries regarding whether bottomless pit required another method of destruction or if it could activate on its own accord (not clear from the card's text). 

I can't understand why the designers didn't release a detailed FAQ regarding each card to begin with.  Lack of play testing with the right types of gamers, from what I can gather.

Quick, well paced, filler game.  It suffers from some problems with replayability and a heavy reliance on luck (Then again, what card game doesn't?), but still fits together nicely for a few quick plays every now and then.

5,5 - 01/11/2015 - I did not get excited from this. I can see there is a bit of tactics: you need to find the best route to build your own dungeon. There is also some strategy into that. You also interact a bit with other players to attract the heroes to your dungeon... but I wonder what really remains of the mechanics once you strip off the nice pixelate art.

This is a very enjoyable dungeon building card game.  The artwork is outstanding.  The game play is simple and enjoyable.  Not fiddly. Some randomness.  Simple at first...but reveals more depth.  

The usual gaggle of idiot BGG complainers and 'uber-strategy-euro-snobs' will moan about it.  Pass them by and get this game.

RATING: 8
A dungeon building game where you play as a dungeon boss trying to attract and kill as many heroes as possible without dying.

The base rule plays fine but it famously has a balance issue where it is very difficult for players to catch up in points if they fall behind. Thus, it is highly recommended to play with the official rule variant Machination.

The gameplay is fine although not as simple and short as I would have liked. The best thing about the game however is its theme. I started playing video games in 2000 so all these 8 bit style graphics that originated from the 80s appeal strongly to me.

RATING: 9
There's a lot of strategy for such a simple concept! Our games are very back and forth, with a lot of "take that!" going on. Normally "take that" games don't work great with my group, but this one gives each player lots of good options to mess with other people (both directly with spells, and indirectly with luring heroes). Not confident it will always be a 10, so giving it the 9.5 for now.

The box and cards are fantastic! Really nice pixel art. The game isn't overly complex, though I did play it wrong a few times and needed clarifications, so the rulebook could be better written.

Backed this one on Kickstarter and only have two plays under my belt. I'm not bowled over. It plays a little slowly for what it is. I feel that there is more strategy than I have discovered, though the luck of your hand contents plays a big part. I'll give it a few more plays before really judging it. The art and flavor are a mix of homage, cleverness, and whimsy.

Not a lot of game here so traded away.

This game brings on so much nostalgia that I feel like a kid again. The humor and references are great and the game play is simple and intuitive enough to pick up quickly, but involved enough to really get into. There's a bit to do with luck of the draw, but honestly, in what card game is there not? This is definitely a favorite. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quite a fun game

PROS:
+ Cool art
+ Nice idea for a game
+ Not many cards feel overpowered, there is a couple
+ You get a random boss, with different level up abilities
+ Even with luck, strategy is still somewhat needed, such as placing down a card with a certain treasure, but the heroes in town that have that treasure type can survive your dungeon, and you get hurt/die.
+ Bosses have experience points, saying who goes first, the only thing this is helpful for is if 2 (or more) players win the game on the same turn, the person with the highest experience wins, since he/she went first and got the "Point" first
+ Games are not that long and adding house rules isn't too hard
CONS:
- With all the cards in the deck, collecting spell cards can be hard or super easy, and the more spell cards you have, the easier the game gets
- This game is LUCK BASED! if you are doing good, the opponent might get a random card that instantly screws you over even though you had the best hand
- The rules are completely fine, but explaining them (At least for me) is somewhat difficult
- Some cards feel a pit overpowered
EXAMPLE(S):    
Beast menagerie, does 4 damage, enough to kill weak heroes in one room, which is a bit "Eh... that's a bit powerful", but wait, there's more, not only that, but you get +2 (Its ability and drawing) room cards for every turn you place down a room card, and even if you don't use its ability by not placing down a room card, you still have to DRAW a room card, so its just +1 room card AT LEAST every turn, which if thrown out long enough, can be really hard to defeat a player with that card down.

Freeze (Spell): Okay, so, this is a very normal card, basically, once you place down this spell, you get to pick a room in your opponents dungeon to "Freeze", making abilities, treasure, and damage all gone for a single turn. now, this doesn't sound that bad huh? Well, its the most single spell card in the game (There are 4 freezes in the whole game, and things like "CAVE IN", which allows you to destroy a room in your dungeon to kill a NPC in your dungeon, there are only 2), and you can place down as many as you want, meaning you can pretty much shut down your entire opponents dungeon, THEN when combined with Assassin (+3 health on any hero in opponents dungeon) and zombie attack (Send a hero from your opponents soul count (The NPC(S) that they have killed), and send it back to the entrance to his/her dungeon, but with +2 health) you have pretty much either won the game or gotten a LOT closer to winning.

Anyway, despite quite a few cons, this game is a good filler for a 1-2 time a week party game. I suggest you try it out, but its not for everyone.

Such an amazing fail. I am a child of the NES era and this should be a perfect fit for me. However the game is much to simple. Even my non-gamer friends asked "Is that all?!" Very little strategy, very little game. Pretty much a "draw a card, play a card, watch the game unfolds" type of thing.

Heard the expansion makes it more palatable but I was so underwhelmed by the base game that I don't care much to invest more money into it.

Boss Monster hat eine wirklich verdammt coole Optik. Das Spiel greift nämlich alte 8-Bit Videospiele auf und packt daran angelehnte Artworks auf die Karten des Spiels. Ja, in Boss Monster ist man ein böses Monster, dass in einem Dungeon hockt und auf ahnungslose Helden wartet. Wer also schonmal so richtig böse sein wollte, hat hierdie Gelegenheit. Mit den gezogenen Karten,baut jeder Spieler seinen ganz persönlichen Dungeon. Dabei gibt es unterschiedliche Räume, die sich in zwei Kategorien einteilen lassen: Fallen- und Monsterräume. Diese haben ganz unterschiedliche Effekte, aber unter´m Strich, sollen sie die einfallenden Helden zur Strecke bringen. Aber Vorichtig: Lockt man zu schnell, zu starke Helden in den eigenen Dungeon, kann unser Boss Monster auch schnell das zeitliche segnen. Hier gilt es überlegt zu planen. Boss Monster ist ein tolles und witziges Spiel. Man plant und baut seinen Dungeon und versucht durch Zauberkarten, den Gegnern die Tour zu vermasseln. Die Artworks sind total witzig und wenn man genau hinschaut, findet man viele lustige Anspielungen, auf die aktuelle Popkultur.

Puntos fuertes: La estética ochentera, jugar con el malo en lugar de los buenos, la temática es original. Mecánica simple que lo hace divertido. Puntos de humor en los textos. La caja es chulísima tanto por fuera como por dentro. La cuna está impresa como una mazmorra de RPG y el manual también está ambientado. Detalles cuidados.

Puntos débiles: Poca variedad de cartas de habitaciones. Después de un par de partidas, ya no tiene misterio. Los hechizos están algo capados. A dos no funciona mal pero quizás se quede un poco corto. Nos falta probarlo a más jugadores. Un poco caro para solo ser un mazo de cartas (25€ en 2017).

Conclusión: Si lo encuentras rebajado cómpratelo. Está bien tenerlo, es entretenido. Un filler para echarte unas risas antes de juegar a un hueso.

Once you get passed the awesomeness of the 8 bit graphics, there isn't much of a game here.  Random cards with a limited variety, limited set of decisions without much in the way of information to understand the implications of those actions, limited actions per turn.  

Edit: Bumped up to 6 after playing with 4 players.   MUCH different and much more complex with 4 players involved

Boss Monster is the definition of an effective Novelty Card Game.

It's quick and easy to play, fun, easily accessible for non-gamers and makes for a great gateway game, and although is easy enough to pick up and get into it has much more strategy then indicated on the surface! It also captures its 16-bit dungeon delving theme well in both looks and game play!

Requires the use of one or two optional rules to really shine (I play with the the 'Machinations' variant as standard), and the expansion 'Tools of Hero Kind' is essential after a couple of plays to add extra challenge!

I really want to like this game The theme is really cool but the gameplay is a bit of a chore. A lot of the card effects are not clearly defined. 2 player games are entirely too luck based with a runaway leader. Too much take that for my taste. 

The rulebook is poorly laid out. Actual proof of this is that the errata is a little more than half as long as the rules.

Fun game but feel like the game design isn't that good. The designers have a great idea but it's not that well implemented into the game.

The idea to have treasures to lure in heroes and the one with the most matching symbols is a good idea. The available rooms to build and spells you have gets too random and it feels like you have too little control of the game. So as before, great ideas but it feels like it's not implemented well.

I rather play Dungeon Lords but it's harder to bring to the table.

Boss Monster tries to capture the feel of an old NES game. You control a "Boss Monster" who is trying to lure local heroes into your dungeon so you can squash them. You do this by building rooms that contain loot that a certain hero type would desire. This room also needs help in the total amount of damage your dungeon can do, as to stop the pesky hero from twamping you. Trying to find the write time to play a room to lure in heroes with out the other Boss Monsters trying to interfere bring the excitement to Boss Monster.

Random, random and random. Too random to my taste. If you have a brain and you have good luck with your cards, you win. That's all there is in this game.

Pros:
- Some nice mechanics and at first you feel this is an awesome game
- Nice pixel graphics, in a peculiar way (the pixel part of it)
- Okay filler

Cons:
- Too random, no safety valve or mechanic to use if you have a bad hand of cards
- The pixel idea should be used all the way, now it's weird mixture of traditional and pixel art
- Slightly too simplistic, this game feels that it has a lot of potential but seems to be unfinished in some way

Our Rating Guide (1 = Disappointed, 3= Hit & Miss, 5= Owned it!)

1. Originality: 4 - Boss Monster plays off of the old school Nintendo themes and plays out as a kind of deck building game from there. 

2. Artwork: 5 - I'm going with hubby's opinion on this. Again, I'm not crazy about it, but the chunky pixels really bring back the nostalgia for him and his friends.  

3. Quality of Contents: 4 - It's all just cards. They seem to hold up well to shuffling. 

4. Storyline: 4 - Rather than the hero, you all play a Boss Monster who is trying to make the most deadly dungeon to kill the adventurers before they kill you.

5. Playthrough: 4 - a low 4 for a 2 player game, a high 4 for a 4 player game. Having more competition makes the game more interesting and less repetitive. 

6. Instructions: 4 - pretty straight-forward, but it's also a simple game. 

7. Replayability: 4 - it's fairly quick and easy. Not one I'd be jumping to play, but then again, it's about selling the theme and for that my hubby and his friends really love it. 	

8. Two player: 3.5 - Maybe it's just because I don't love it enough, but I more so just go along with it for a 2 player game rather than being the one to suggest we give it another go.

9. Large Group: 4 player max.

10. Fun Factor: my rating: 3.5 - hubby rating: 4.5 You really need to love the theme. You also need those 4 players to get more thrill out of it, otherwise you're kind of just going through the motions a bit.

I like this one alright. The Tom complains that there are too many turns on which you have no good options for what to do; I haven't really experienced that. Mostly playing with smaller player counts; maybe that's why?

Having access to the spell cards *is* pretty important, but you can usually get it if you prioritize it.

I REALLY wanted to give this a higher rating.  8bit style dungeon building card game???!??!?!??   AWESOME!  

The cards are cool, the powers are neat.  There's definitely some strategy, but ultimately, if you draw crappy cards, you can't counter your opponents very well.

Every game played so far, one of us were able to get 4 or 5 heroes in one swoop because all of the heroes of the single type were drawn to that particular dungeon, and the heroes were all wimpy so there's 4 or 5 coins and if you already had 5 or 6 coins, you just won the game.

It's still a 6 in my eyes and I'll play it if friends ask, but I won't seek it out on my own.

Thanks,

Good geek theme, but the high luck factor (what cards you draw) can severely ruin your game experience. Better mechanics should have been designed to cycle the cards in hand. 2-player game is cozy, but a 4-player game can become brutal as 10 heroes may stack in the village and then 6-7 of them may enter one player's dungeon during the next turn. If he's not ready, he dies and the others all laugh. If you're the person in question, you just cry.

I really want to love this game.  I do look at it fondly, but a game that needs you to alter the rules a bit so that you can balance the randomness of the card draws, I get upset.  I WILL play more, and probably get an expansion, so maybe this rating will go up, but as of now I need to change the rules so some of us don't get bent over the entire game.

This game has the most brilliant artwork and premise.  You are a boss in an 8 bit side scrolling video game trying to per sway and than kill heroes in your dungeon.  Excellent premise, game play, and art work...just need to help the random card draws AND give the people losing a little umph to get closer to competition.

Cute enough throwback to 80s console games, but I'm guessing that all plays of this end up the same way: with 75% of the players awaiting bubble victory on a specific turn, the outcome of which depends entirely on luck of the draw: e.g., how many clerics get flipped, who holds/draws/plays the right spell card at the right time. Amusing, unsatisfying.

liked it much less on a second go-round. In addition to the above, it takes too long for the amount it hinges on luck of the draw. Bleccch... dropping from 5.5

Um card game de regras simples, mas muito divertido. A começar pelo tema: cada jogador é um "chefão" de videogame, cujo objetivo é montar a masmorra mais mortal possível. Cada sala tem um tipo de tesouro, que vai atrair um tipo de herói. O segredo é ter uma masmorra que seja ao mesmo tempo atraente e letal - mesmo para os heróis épicos que começam a aparecer depois. Recomendado para jogadores novatos e nostálgicos do Super Nintendo - toda a arte é meio pixelizada, e as cartas são inspiradas em personagens e jogos famosos.

I like this game a lot!  The one complaint that I have with it is that it doesn't flow perfectly in a group...something about the game limits conversation and interpersonal dynamism...probably because of how much reading everyone is doing.

This game was a bunt at best.  I'd give it a way lower review if the cards weren't beautiful and didn't evoke nostalgia.

The concept of this game is awesome and amazing.  It makes grandiose promises of building a dungeon, getting heroes to explore it, and then hopefully fighting them.

The game itself is weak, perhaps one of the weakest games I've put on the table so far, but before we get to the bad stuff, let's talk about what was good.

The card stock is great and I wish more games used this (or linen).  The art is amazing.  The rulebook is just good enough and it can literally get your game started within 10 minutes of opening the box.

That's it.

Why is the game bad?  Well let's start with the title of the game: Boss Monster.  You play a Boss Monster, like Dracula or Bowser-esque characters from our favorite games and mythos, but you don't feel like a boss, at all.  From turn 1 you don't even feel that boss-like and by the end of the game you're really just something printed on a card.

Your Boss Monster levels up when you level up, which usually happens around turn 5 (which is about 1/5 way through the game).  Each monster does something, but once you see what every monster can do you feel a bit cheated.

The concept of the game is everyone simultaneously builds something.  You can only have 5 rooms in your dungeon and you upgrade from there.  By the time you hit the 'half way point' your dungeon is probably as good as it's going to get since the cards available in the game have tons of doubles, triples, etc and they simply don't do much.

Then heroes will go to the dungeon that has the most corresponding icons in a player's dungeon.  (Clerics will go to ankhs, theives will go to treasure, wizards will go for scrolls, and fighters go to swords).  If players are ever tied then the hero stays there.  This often causes a huge hault in the game since those ties becomes incredibly hard to break since the only way to break a tie is find a card with more of that symbol that you can play ontop of a preexisting room, but rooms cannot be built onto rooms unless they have the same symbol!  So you can see the issue here, that chances are you already have the best of that type of card so that hero simply isn't going anywhere unless a player casts a spell.

Ah yes, spells!  These spells are not very thematic with who you are really and some boarder on 'why is this in the game' to 'why do I have 3 copies of this in my hand?'  The game really relies on copies of copies, by the end of a game you feel like you've seen every card available and you can count them on your fingers and toes.

By 3/4 in heroes cannot survive anything in your dungeon and they never even get to your boss.  And that's only in half the games.  The other half of games the heroes are dropping like flies, especially since many spells and rooms outright kill heroes or buff other rooms so that they outright kill a hero!

And what if the hero some how makes it through?!  Well it gets to your boss and guess what?!  Your boss doesn't do anything and you take 1 damage.  So really your boss card is just something to track health with!  But don't worry because I've never ever seen someone's boss monster die!

This game is weak, really weak!  Is this game worth anything?  No.  Do people like this game?  My little brother does, but he can't really explain why.  I think he just likes the art, which is fine, but this game is flat.  Your Boss does nothing, your dungeon will kill pretty much anyone pretty early in the game and it feels like there are 10 spell cards in a large deck!  Some spells are simply overpowered, others feel like there should be more like them, and many are just really completely useless!  Like one is called motivation, the card allows you to build one extra room that turn if someone else has more rooms than you.  This doesn't happen!  Because you all build at the same pace and everyone usually hits max rooms by turn 5.  Which means you need this card by turn 2-3 and not have built a room (or had one destroyed) to do anything.

This is a bad game.  Really bad people.

A super-light version of Dungeon Lords. Each player builds their own set of rooms in their own tableau, where each room has symbols and kill points, which both lure the adventurers (cards that get turned over in the middle each round) and then kill them. If you have the most fighter symbols, you'll attract the fighters, and so on. If you've got enough kill points, you'll get a VP, otherwise the adventurer survives and you get a wound. 5 wounds eliminates you, but eliminations generally happen a turn before someone wins so it shouldn't be an issue. It's pretty random in what rooms you draw (one per turn) and therefore what symbols you can compete in, and then what adventurers turn up (do they turn up in the symbols in which you're leading). But the rooms have all sorts of special powers and spells provisions, so there's decent interest in how you build your dungeon, what powers will work well in combination, deciding on the tradeoffs between symbols you want vs high kill points in other symbols maybe. The spells allow you to interact with other players, ie stop the leader, on top of the competition interaction, but spells are harder to come by after setup, so they're nowhere near overwhelming. It's a nice opener/closer that shoots along at a nice pace, and has a fun theme.

I've found that this game actually plays better with two than with four; maybe we just got a bad shuffle, but we never really had any build-up in the Town with four, and the people who got an early lead were ahead the entire game. Clever art style, and easy mechanics.

"Not really my type of game, with majority effects and some take that cards. But OK as a filler"

What I like:
- It's just cards
- The 8-bit fantasy theme is cute
- Being a monster/dungeon opposing heroes is fun

What I don't like:
- Several attack cards and effects
- It seemed a bit long (50 minutes)
- Overall, was a bit dull, for me
- The tiny print was hard to read in medium light

Our first play took about 50 minutes after 10 minutes of rules/setup. I would put the weight around 1.5.

Can best be described as.....meh. The artwork is great for this looking for a jolt of nostalgia. There is some light strategy in trying to best get the heroes to either move or stay put. Ultimately, it is luck of the draw. Can you get the right rooms with the right amount of damage to handle the epic heroes, which is where the game gets decided. Ordinary heroes are precursors to the main event. The only competitive game I've played was neck and neck until the epic heroes started getting drawn. By then, my opponent couldn't get the cards to lure the hero away, and I was lucky to have a dungeon with enough damage to win. It's fun, but it won't be the first game I suggest at a gathering.

RATING: 2
This game had so much potential, but the execution is pretty awful. 

There is very little interaction between players. You build your own dungeon. The heroes come to town, you figure out which hero goes where, and then it's either "yup, beat him" or "nope, got hurt".

There isn't really that much difference between the rooms, or the heroes. They could have done something really interesting by giving rooms drastically different abilities, and heroes different skills that would tally scores rather than just win/lose the fight.

The game is called Boss Monster, you take on the role of a Boss Monster, so then why is the boss monster essentially irrelevant? Why am I relying entirely on the dungeon to kill the hero? If the hero makes it through the dungeon, I lose the fight? Isn't beating the Boss Monster supposed to be the hardest part of the dungeon?!

I played this game both in two-player and four-player, and was left with the same feeling both times. It felt like we were playing it wrong, like we were missing important details. But after going over the instructions, we were doing everything right.

The game seems to drag on at times, without much really happening, and then all of a sudden, someone wins. There's no sense of victory, because the winner in both games we played just won suddenly, without anyone feeling any anticipation of the game coming to a close.

Also, and maybe I'm just nitpicking here, but why would they try so hard to emulate an NES game box, but then use 16-bit videogame graphics on all the cards?

I feel like Boss Monster gets a bad rap as a random game where random things happen and you might win or lose, but it's not really because you did anything intelligent.

If you play Boss Monster the way it's meant to be played, which is throwing heroes at your opponents when your dungeons are weaker, building up when you can, letting someone get up to like 8 or 9 points with their mediocre dungeon that can handle the small guys at the start of the game, and then shifting into an endgame playstyle where you either go ham and collect as many heroes as possible or force your opponents to get killed by the epic heroes, then it becomes an interesting experiment in bluffing and bidding.

This isn't a game for everyone, and it feels a little slow when trying to play with people who don't know the rules like the back of their hand.  People often play out of turn order, which really skews the game strategy, so the owner of the game really needs to pull the reins in.

I bought it and played it twice and was a lot of fun, card drafting and making a castle and actually attacking other players was really fun, but the 3rd time I played this, one of the players just didn't seem to pick anything good. I thought it could be one of those times someone just has shitty luck, but no, it kept happening, it didn't matter if it was an experienced player or a new one, it happened about a 30% of the times it was played, it was frustrating watching people doing  so much and you just get screwed over and over again.

Don't get me wrong, the game is fun but if you get shit luck on your draws it is not going anywhere. And usually, people that get this bad play once, don't want to play it anymore.

I sold it because it is too english dependant for my casual friends and because I'd rather play Guillotine for a card driven game.

I personally enjoy this game and the uncertainty of the quests. There's strategy and luck mixed together in your draws, which keeps it exciting. It isn't my favourite though, primarily because it's somewhat difficult to teach to new players, and the theme isn't more widely appealing (ironically, the theme is why it's so popular, but it doesn't help get my fiancee to play with me the way TTR does). Anyhow, I enjoy the gameplay, though always forget the rules and need to consult the book each time because I don't get to play it often enough. Strong theme and strategy elements, but also tooled with luck.

You and your fellow bosses decide to have a bit of fun by taking on a challenge. The challenge is this: Build a dungeon and attract would be heroes to your dungeon and kill them!!! Whoever kills 10 points worth of would be heroes first, wins.
 
This game is everything it is supposed to be. The nostalgia is great with excellent references to past 8-bit bosses. My friends and I always have fun when we play Boss Monster and I encourage new players to pick up this title and give it a shot.

Cute, quick card game where you build a dungeon to try to murder heroes who come to kill you and take your loot. It's a bit random in terms of what cards you happen to draw, and drawing new cards can be a bit slow, especially when you can't get the correct amount of symbols to attract the heroes. The cuteness helps a lot, and while the mechanics are simple, they are enjoyable. It's not a replacement for Dungeon Lords, but it's nice to have around.

A card building dungeon crawl. You build a set of rooms, trying to get enough kill points and card combos to prevent the opposing heroes from having enough points to penetrate your lair. You have to trade off attracting the adventurers, having counter cards (spells) and rooms to inflict damage. 
While you get rooms as part of the turn, getting the spells was a result of card play. 
It was ok but didn't really do much for me. I wasn't much into classic video games so the theme is lost on me.

Pros:
* Cute art style. Having grown up with 8- and 16-bit games, I appreciated the nostalgia. Those were the golden days of video games.
* Small package that still fits thin-sleeved cards.
* Quick setup and play.

Cons:
* Normally I like some take-that in my games, but for some reason I disliked the ways the spells interacted in this game.
* I don't mind games with a lack of control, but this game might be over my limit.
* Too many unique cards. Not a con for some people, but I generally don't like this sort of game.

= 2014-03-02 - R:5

I was talked into buying this when I picked up another dungeon themed game and the person behind the counter insisted that I HAD to try Boss Monster. Having already passed on the kickstarter and not being all that interested in the game once it hit the shelves, it's therefore not surprising that the game only slightly exceeded my expectations.

Not a bad game at all, but not something that has a place in my collection. I'm not really fond of games with tons of unique card powers as they often degenerate into a game of hoping the card you need shows up. I love games with a fair bit of luck and a chaotic lack of control (see, for example, Babel, Vineta, 7 Dragons), but I prefer when those games have a small number of different cards so your odds of getting the card you hoped for is higher (see, for example, Babel, Vineta, 7 Dragons).

After only a single play, it's fair to say I've probably missed something, but I kind of felt like the game was playing itself and there weren't many meaningful decisions for me to make. You can (partially) control what treasure types you want in your dungeon, but you don't know ahead of time what the heros will want or how powerful they'll be so it's a crapshoot. Your opponent's spell cards can have a huge impact on you and there's not much strategy for dealing with it. You don't draw enough cards each turn to offset the inherent luck of the draw.

Again, I've only played it once, but it also seemed like the rich get richer and the poor get poorer in this game. My opponent had some good rooms for drawing spells and he used those spells effectively against me. By the middle of the game, he'd forced my hand down pretty small and I didn't have much to work with. Good play on his part.

To be fair, for all the apparent imbalance in our cards, I think by the end I had 7 points and 0 wounds to his 10 points and 3 wounds and he only won because a lucky draw let him survive the last epic hero to go through his dungeon. If I'd allowed more damage to get to my boss, I might have had some spells left over I could have used to thwart him. It's fair to say there are things I could have done differently, but I'm not sure how much I could have *planned* to have done those things differently.

I like this game less every time I play it. My son likes this, probably because of the theme and pixel art, although no one who has played it with him neither understands it or has the patience. I've give it and Boss monster 2 and both expansions enough chances and now feel confident to refuse another play. As others have rated it higher, possibly not my cup of tea or anyone else's apart from my son (who I'm sure just like the idea of the game).

RATING: 5
Boss Monster was a bit of an impulse buy for me.  My two sons, now ages 14 and 11, saw it in the store and were quickly attracted by its video game theme.  I admit, the packaging is really clever and the art is very nice.  The boys seem to enjoy it quite a bit, which is the important thing.

I am not as enamoured by the game, however.  The game play seems off. I find that I don't have many options when placing rooms and thus often resort to playing the room with the best damage each turn.  Some of the effects are nice, but the way things are done makes it difficult to set up an "engine" so to speak.   The spell cards are nice but are often difficult to obtain.  If you draw certain rooms it's not difficult at all, but other times you feel shut out.

The bosses do have special powers but these are activated only once per game.  Oddly enough, the boss monsters also do no damage to the hero.  I would have liked to see the bosses have a little more effect on the game play.

Lastly, I wish the cards were of better quality.  The art is very nice, but cards are starting to chip (which shows easily on the black border) after only a few plays.  The game is relatively inexpensive, so I suppose this is forgivable, but I would have preferred to pay a little extra and have higher quality card material.

Final verdict?  This game was a disappointment to me.  It seems "close" to being good but just isn't quite there.  The theme is fun, and my boys enjoy it.  It plays quickly so I don't mind playing with them despite the games shortcomings although I am never going to suggest we play it.

There simply is no reason to have someone sitting there looking at their phone for 15 minutes while the rest of the people at the table are engaged.  It's just lazy design.

There is too much luck for me to get too engaged in a game like this.  As such, it's a pass for me.

This game can be fun in small doses, and the pixel art and flavor text is all top notch, but it's a little more aggressive and luck based than my usual liking.

That's a game I really wanted to enjoy, but I can't. The rules are too fiddle, and it depends a lot on luck. I know, it's normal to depend on luck on card games but, sometimes you need to build extra rooms and you have nothing you can do with your hand. The fact that some rooms are upgrades to previously placed rooms (golden rooms) breaks the game, because you may have a hand full of golden rooms you can't play and no silver rooms.

RATING: 4
03-04-2014. Rated after 1 play. Boss monster is themed as an old-school 8-bit computergame, which is fun theme and rarely used! In this game you basically build a 'dungeon', by placing and upgrading room tiles in order to protect your end-game boss. 

Basically, each turn you can lure some heroes, kill them in your dungeon and score points (1 for an easy hero, 2 for an 'epic hero'. First to 10 points wins. 

You start the game with 5 room cards and 2 spell cards. You then have to discard down to a 3 room cards. Each subsequent turn, you basically reveal 4 heroes that are available to lure to your dungeon. You then draw 1 card from a deck of room tiles and place one room card in front of your monster (max 5). These room cards provide you with a varying amount of damage for adventuring heroes, and some room cards may have special abilities when coming in play. 

After everyone is done with placing their room card, you lure heroes into your dungeon. Heroes come in different kinds (Thief, fighter, mage and clerric), and are lured by the amount of treasures you have for them. These treasures are depicted by a symbol (sowords/books etc) on your room cards. If you have the most of one symbol, all heroes of that type visit your dungeon. You then simply count all defense values of your dungeon and trigger any room ability that may have a changing effect. If you kill the hero, you score VPs. If the hero is able to defeat your dungeon (ie. your total damage is lower than the hitpoint value of the hero), you lose damage equal to its attack value )1 for normal heroes, 2 for epic).

Te game is extremely light, fun, but I guess ultimately not for me. I suspect casual/light gamers will enjoy the game however and it makes for an acceptable filler. I just notice that I do not enjoy it enough to play it more often, although I might play it in the right mood.

RATING: 2
This is the first game I bought without first playing and I regret it.  
------------------
The Good:
------------------
The concept sounded original enough. Like many commentators, I was drawn by the art work and the unique concept of playing as an end-level boss.  The game was also pitched as a light-weight, quick-to-play strategy game, which appealed to me. The instruction book was well laid-out, clear, and concise. This looked like a professional product. 
------------------
The Bad:
-----------------
However, the game fell short of my expectations. I feel that there is no strategy and there is little to no player interaction. Each of the games I have played had minimal spell playing and, often times, my friends and I would just tally up the damage in our dungeon and immediately resolve the Souls/Wounds. We didn't even bother moving the hero one room at a time, as no one typically had a way to stop their opponent. 

Acquiring spell cards, the only way to really interact with other players, proved difficult for me, as I rarely had dungeon cards that allowed me to draw them. Additionally, rooms that allowed me to draw cards, when a player died within them, never really activated. This is an example of how leveraging room abilities became frustrating. There should be a  mechanic in the game which allows a player to reorganize their dungeon (without needing to draw the same card and placing on top of another room). 

In short: This game needs to provide more options. Cards should either be more versatile (with multiple uses) or the designers need to add mechanics that give players more options, such as discarding two cards and drawing a card in exchange. There is not enough strategy and the game really turns out to be mostly luck of the draw.
-----------------------
Points of Improvement:
-----------------------
Perhaps this is extending the game outside of its intended boundaries, but:

1. Add mechanic for moving a room in a dungeon. This action would replace your build phase. You can move one room to any other part of your dungeon. 
2. Allow players to discard room cards, in exchange for a spell card. There are many times when you have     a useless hand, full of advanced rooms that you cannot use. Give the player a way to deal with that. I suggest allowing the player to discard 2 room cards for the ability to draw one spell or room card. This will provide another way to obtain spell cards and increase player interaction. This will also mitigate poor drawing luck.
3. Give the Boss Monster more of an identity! The Boss cards are somewhat boring and there is little difference between the cards. I feel the player should be able to choose his "character" and that character should champion a particular playing style. For instance: Each Boss should have a mechanic, which *slightly* changes the way the game is played for that player. In my opinion, the Bosses lack personality and their abilities add very little to the game.

Conclusion:

I'm very disappointed in this game. It feels a bit gimmicky. This is not a strategy game.

Amazing artwork; truly evokes the feel of NES video games. Unfortunately, the gameplay is heavily luck-driven with very unbalanced card abilities. Still, the theme and the short play time makes this relatively fun. I would never buy it but I would be willing to play it if offered.

I have very mixed feelings about this game. I love the theme and the artwork. That part all came together so well. I also really enjoyed the experience of building my dungeon. I did not like the take that element though. This is similar to many other type of games, where for every step forward other players are ready to knock you two steps back. There are a ton of take that card games. I am not a fan of the genre, but this is might be the best one I have played.

Call this Dungeon Lords: The Card Game, since the theme is identical, but the mechanisms are simple, different and card-based. Push your luck in attracting the heroes to your dungeon via player majority in 4 different treasure symbols, but ensure you can kill them instead of letting them give you wounds. First to harvest 10 souls wins, but accumulate 5 wounds and you're eliminated. Room cards (that you build linearly, 2D sidescroller hah!), spell cards and your boss avatar add flavor. Wish heroes did more than just being blank slates with 3 stats (though that's like Dungeon Lords too!).

Push-your-luck is really just pick your favorite for the 30-min niche. This one is an above-average contender with a nice theme, artwork and some good card interaction with other players (instead of just 'I'm brave at the wrong time and you're a coward at the wrong time').

My feeling about this game is that you have two critical turns at the beginning when is easy to be defeated if a bunch of heroes enter your dungeon before it is "ready". Therefore is quite usual that you are taken out of the game pretty soon. If you survive those turns... The game is quite mechanic and there is not much that you can do in it. Just a game to spend some time until dinner is ready.

really solid game, and my boys love it, much more than expected.  It's a light game - light enough that it is the first "take that" game my boys will play without someone getting upset - but still requires some thought and strategic play.  Theme is fantastic and excellently done.  The leveling up aspect of both the dungeon and the monster bonus really appeals to them.  It isn't the kind of game that plays forever - I'd guess we'll get 10 to 20 plays out of it - but at its very low price point (not for the ridiculously priced legendary version), it has already been far worth the price.

Love the artwork and all the video game in-jokes and pop culture references.  I also like the concept of building a dungeon of traps and monsters to kill monsters you lure in.  I wasn't as big of a fan of the "take that!" nature of most of the spell cards, which felt like an artificial way to add more interaction to the game (which would otherwise be multiplayer solitaire), and given how few cards you get in the game, it's very luck of the draw based.

As a design, Boss Monster is terrible. Nostalgia is its only ally. There aren't many decisions and none are the least bit difficult. The cards are so unbalanced that players might have [i]no[/i] chance of winning before making [i]any[/i] choices at all. That's a huge problem. Another problem is that the turn-based rules make the game slower and more tedious than playing cards simultaneously in real time, which is how we played, but not how the rules are written. If I can see this after one play, what does that tell you about the playtesting? It's all the more frustrating because it could have been a decent game. 

With real time simultaneous play, it's not irritating to play like some games I rate 2 or 3 because it's so short, but it's a typical overhyped underdeveloped Kickstarter project that somehow raised over $200,000, an obscene sum for a broken game. Boss Monster deserves the rating I've given it. It's an offensively half-baked design.

I was very close to backing this game when it was on Kickstarter.  It enthralled me with the 8-bit pixel art and classic video game references and parodies.  I didn't though and I'm glad I didn't after getting a chance to play it.

The game is played with each player controlling a boss monster and building monster and trap rooms to attract and murder heroes that show up each turn.  Each room attracts one of the four hero tropes and whoever has the most attractive dungeon attracts those heroes and all the rooms do different damage values and a few have special abilities.  Finally, each player also has spell cards they can play to either supplement themselves or attack their opponents.

This is fine as a lighter game and has some appeal for people who recognize the jokes and like the pixel art.  This game was way too random to appeal to me though.  Dungeon rooms and spells range from extremely powerful to completely worthless and sometimes one person draws all of just one end of this spectrum.  The same could be said about the heroes health.  There are a couple decisions to make and you have some control over the game but that control is completely overshadowed by luck of the draw and often the winner is the luckier player.

This is Dungeon Lord and Munchkin bastard child.
It has Dungeon Lord's theme with a pandering 16-bit graphic design (and don't be fooled nothing here is related to NES video game outside the art).
And it has Munchkin gameplay with everything related: randomness and luck of draw, take that, no meaningful decision, etc. The good point is it won't drag on like Munchkin.
This is like any pop stars; beautiful to look at, doesn't bring anything to the table and dead empty inside.

RATING: 4
Simple tableau-builder with a cute theme: each player is boss of an RPG dungeon which they want to fill with five rooms; dungeons attract heroes from a common pool based on the type of treasure (mages want magic books, etc.) and damage them. Dead heroes become VP (reach a certain number to win), while heroes who survive become wounds (reach a certain number to be eliminated).

Interaction is indirect competition and in a number of direct "take that" cards, mostly around removing cards from opponents' dungeons.

The card artwork is reminiscent of SNES-era JRPGs (and the box reminiscent of a NES game box), but graphic design is basic and the general impression is of cheapness. The degree of text on many dungeon, spell and boss cards is a little annoying unless/until all cards are memorized. A common set of icons may have been better.

It has nothing particularly special to offer so the graphical issues are enough for me to never want to play it again; I'd be more inclined to choose a similarly-themed filler like Dungeon Raiders.

[Brotherwise Games Kickstarter 2013 edition] {Dungeons; hand management; scalable} I joined the Kickstarter campaign because the theme and card illustration is interesting.  Yes, the card illustration is fun.  And the add-ons in the Kickstarter version is excellent.

I didn't have high hope about the game; however, it's more fun than I expected.  If playing aggressively, this game is fun by hurting your opponents mercilessly.

The rulebook is great and the game is easy to understand.  Replayability is so-so even with many bosses - it seems that more spell cards are needed.

One drawback of this game is that the challenge fades as the game progresses.  Once the dungeons established, it's not easy to hurt a boss even with the Epic Heroes.  At this time, it all comes to spell cards to try to hurt opponents by surprise, or by attracting heroes to your dungeon to get more points.

A stand alone strategy card game for 2-4 players. You are each constantly building a dungeon and aiming to kill the most of a series of non-player heroes by balancing your dungeon's perilousness with its attractiveness to the heroes. Too perilous and your opponents will lure all heroes away from you, too attractive and the heroes will kill you before you win. The depth of this dynamic, along with the unique powers the room and spell cards give you, bolsters the interaction between the players, and provides much variety for replayability.

As other reviewers have noted, the spell system doesn't always feel completely smooth, so perhaps the rules should be clarified with respect to this (advanced rules are online). And as with any deck building game where the cards are dealt randomly, there is quite a bit of luck, but you could always vary the rules to reduce the frequency of spell cards, which would maintain a higher ratio of strategy. So although Boss Monster is not completely perfect, these issues don't stop it being one of my favourite games. And moreover, awesome though the retro video game card art is, I don't think there'd be any love lost over the gameplay if it weren't for this theming.

This was described to me as Dungeon Lords without all the complexity and worker placement. Well, it is, but only in theme. It has none of the depth, scope of choices, creative solutions, clever dependencies of chains of actions. It's a simple 'throw cards down' little filler that is pretty heavily dependant on card draw. Oh, and don't accidentally go for the same icons as another player; you'll essentially be guaranteed to lose. 

There's really little here of value. I don't really care for the artwork, it was never funny and the random take-that from spells added nothing. Tedious deterministic combat.

Kickstarted game.  Definitely the best KS campaign I've participated in.  The joy of watching the game gain backers and stretch goals was practically worth the cost of the game.  Delivery was 4 months late, but the product turned out very nice.

I love the art and the humor of the game.  The KS exclusives in particular are great.  So far I've enjoyed the 2 player game a lot more than the 4 player.  The two problems I've encountered are that it's difficult to keep track of other players' rooms, and it's fairly easy to get card locked where you have few to no choices to make.  The combination of these two make it feel like you don't have much control.  I've started playing with a BGG user suggested variant where you get to draw a room card at the end of each turn where you don't gain a soul.  That variant opens things up a little and helps with runaway leaders.

RATING: 6.6
The theme is so incredibly interesting that it sucked me in big time, and I now own most of the expansions. The gameplay is somewhat unique (a non-euro, card version of Dungeon Lords perhaps?) and the art is great. However, there is a bit too much 'take that', as the spell cards can be brutal. And they are not all that well balanced, as some can be meh, while others can be brutal and kill a player in a single shot (while being difficult to prepare for). Also, it kind of sucks that the bosses have no ability to fight the heroes. Kind of defies the theme. Still, an ok game, but mostly because of the theme.

RATING: 7
I really like the mechanic of this game despite its pitfalls. It really makes you feel like you are the Boss monster in a 16bit game trying to kill the hero. My only criticism to the game is that every boss in a video game is the hardest to defeat so I feel there should be something the boss can do against the hero. At any rate I love the game. It is simple and fast to learn with a bit of strategy to it. Better played with more than two people.

The longer I play board games, the more I dislike card games.  It seems that every card exists to have a rule digested mid-game.  Boss Monster works the same way, but the game is so quick and the art is so charming that I couldn't resist it.  Once you understand how it works and can explain it like a video game, you'll become a hit with the Millenials in your household.

Boss Monster is a cute little deckbuilding game kinda like Dungeon Lords lite.  You're some sort of boss monster baddie and there are heros coming every turn to get you.  Build new rooms to your dungeon so that you can kill the heros before they kill you.  Rooms attract certain types of heroes, do various amounts of damage and have special powers.  This isn't the deepest game, but it's fairly quick and fun.

RATING: 6.5
[thing=131835][/thing] could be called [thing=45315][/thing]: the Card Game, mainly because on it players are villains (aka: the boss monsters) that build a dungeon in order to attract bold heroes to it, for your monsters minions and traps kill them - it is a matter of respect and distinction among boss monsters: the one that kills more and the best ones, will be the top monster.

The way this happen is quite simple: a number of heroes equal to the number of players are revealed. Then, every player may choose to add a card from the hand to the dungeon, and these came in two types: monster rooms and traps (with two levels: normal/silver and upgrade/gold). This build phase happens simultaneously among players. There is a limit of 5 cards to form the dungeon, so, if the dungeon already has 5 cards on it (rooms built above others, did not count to these five), the players will be able to only upgrade a room (in this case, the normal room and the upgrade room must share at least one icon) or to build a normal above other room. Every room card has four informations: 1) its type; 2) its effect; 3) the damage that it will inflict on the heroes; 4) icons that are used to attract the heroes.

After the build phase happens the bait phase, when the heroes go from the middle of the table to the dungeon of the players. The heroes have icons also - sword, holy symbol, bag of money, book - and they will go to the dungeon that has more icons that match its type. If there is a tie among the players in the number of icons, the hero won't move, staying where he/she is.

Then there is the exploration phase (I don't know if this is the actual name, but it will do), where the hero will pass through the rooms, taking damage. If the hero dies before reaching the boss monsters, the player takes the hero as points. If the hero reaches the boss, it will do damage - the player takes the card as such. If the boss monster receives 5 points of damage - it is out of the game. The game ends when a player reaches 10 points in heroes - then the boss with the most points is the winner (eliminated bosses can't win, even if they have more points).

[thing=131835][/thing] is reasonable fast, it gives room for choices regarding the rooms (which order, which effects, which icons and so on). A player must be somewhat careful - if the boss atracts heroes beyond his "level", the heroes will have a field day (in our game, one of the players took 9 points of damage, after attracting 3 epic heroes without being able to handle them with his dungeon). The 8-bit art if phenomenal, giving the game a great feel. There is a good amount of player interaction, but not enough to make it a "take that" kind of game, nor I see much room for king-making.

So I will be happy to play [thing=131835][/thing] again.

*****

After my second play, I notice that once someone pulls ahead, he is gone. If comes three heroes with a symbol only one player is ahead, and he can deal with all of them, well, you basically lost. No catch up mechanism (except you are less likely to receive some "take that" cards), nor limitation to the number of heroes someone can call in a turn. Sure, I only played two times, but in both the winner won easily, without any tension.

I still think this isn't a bad game, but sure is lacking in some aspects.

This game is far too complicated to understand. Four of us tried to play this game and not a single one of us could understand how to complete a single turn. The instruction booklet uses many terms that are not defined anywhere. For instance the game has rules for when a hero should stay or leave town, it never explains what the town is or what that has to do with the game. For a casual seeming game it should not take every player to have to read the instructions cover to cover and still not be able to play the game.

Was so excited when I heard the concept.  But much like the smell of the box, the game really leaves a bad taste of what could have been.  I can play it, on the rare occasion, and enjoy myself, but the game really lacks replayability.  Not enough boss monsters, not enough rooms... and then instead of releasing an expansion (needs one), they release a separate sequel.

After more plays, my opinions haven't changed, however I have found fun in occasional plays with my wife. Enjoyable as long as you don't take it too seriously and don't overplay it.

Good game.  I like the theme of dungeon crawling, but done in video game/boss style.

Otherwise, fun game and love the pixelated art.

Cute game. The only pixel style game that has actually appealed to me, fits the theme well creating a retro side scroller.  

I know it's supposed to be a light filler take-that game, but it still feels lacking.  Far too luck of the hand dependent.  You're only drawing one card a turn, so it's far too likely that you just can't do the things you want to do.

This game is a perfect exemplar of what's both good and bad about Kickstarter.  The theme is trendy, the art is top-notch, and the gameplay is forgettable.  I do have a soft spot for the retro pixelated graphics, and the adventure video games that the art style is in, but I also will not be sad to never play this game again.  The cards aren't especially balanced, and the game will have a tendency to just kind of go until it doesn't anymore.  There's no narrative flow to this game beyond the forced-feeling epic heroes toward the bottom of the deck.  Play this once with a friend's copy if the graphics and style appeal to you, but there's no reason to own this.

I love the strategy in this game, and the way best-laid plans can sometimes go right out the window. It's kind of like a MUCH less complicated version of Dungeon Lords, without the worker-placement component. Really cute art, and I love the wide-ranging sci-fi/fantasy references built into the heroes

Absolutely awful. Half-arsed ideas of randomness upon randomness. Unfortunately, I made a big mistake one of the few, early, meaningful decisions I had - I could have killed myself and have "won" by being out of the game after a few minutes, but I did not so I had to play on.

Enjoyed the theme and the card art and also the player interaction. Would play again to try to strike the right balance of attracting heroes, collecting souls, and not being killed by opponents for being first: spells seem to be the key.

A card driven attempt at a dungeon crawl. Intended to be brutal I guess. Two plays and zero fun. Love the art and theme but man this one missed the mark.

[I]Boss Monster: The Dungeon Building Card Game[/I] is a very simple card game, but I do love the funny references and nostalgic 8-bit artwork, which is also the main reason why I acquired the game. The game has some real potential, but it's a bit too light, and I have concerns regarding the replay value. I'm hoping a few decent expansions in the near future might fix this.

An ok game.  Pretty easy to pick up and understand but lacking in depth and limited strategy.  Neat idea but it seems like it's missing something.

I think everyone is just drinking the retro video game Kool-aid on this one. Not challenging strategy wise, not all that interesting tactically. There just isn't enough card play to hold one's attention. People slammed Dungeon lords for only having a handful of meaningful actions to take over the course of the game. Well, this is a streamlined version of Dungeon Lords, and quite frankly, there are even less meaningful decisions to be made.

RATING: 9
Very easy game to learn and to teach new players.  with only a few quick explanations on what difference between the room, spell, boss, and hero cards you can easily learn as you play (granted, it helps to have someone read and understand the rules before doing so). Very minimum to nil time spend checking the rule book.  The game requires a lot of reading and strategizing, but the analysis paralysis is manageable and after a couple of turns, the players have got a hand of it and wait time is reduced exponentially.  Fun by all.

I find this game to be a little slow to learn and difficult to teach.  I do enjoy it, but it does feel like one of those games where the winner is very clear early on, and rarely leads to intense gameplay.

Played it with 4 people again.  Gameplay still Munchkin-like but it goes faster; played it semi-correctly this time (though one issue came up which the rulebook wasn't clear on).  The game really needs an FAQ or an errata section since there's quite a few special cases.  After this second play, I think 7 is the highest it'll get.

With particular players and in the right mood, Boss Monster really works, especially when everyone recognises references and roll-plays events. Ultimately it's a simple game but that's not always a bad thing, as long as you know what you're in for.

Nice Tower Defence like cardgame. There's quite some luck and randomness involved with the cards you draw, but enough interection that allow you to harass the king of the hill. The stunning packinging and adorable 8-bit artwork make it a collectors item.

It is an OK game.  It doesn't make me want to gouge my eyes out like Munchkin, but there really isn't any reason to play this.  The winner will inevitably be the one who draws the best combination of card.

Well after playing the game yesterday I was not over joyed as much as I thought I would be. It's fun but the print on the card in the lower 1/2 is too small, hard to read for us older people. The mechanics are good. I will have to try again soon to see if I will change my opinion.

Fantasy card game inspired from vintage video game classics. Dungeon bosses bid against each other to add side scrolling dungeon room cards with treasure and damage values to attract heroes. Interactive spells make things flat out silly. The goal, to be best at defeating heroes before they destroy you.

I was starved for amusement five minutes into the game, but it only got worse with each passing eyeroll. [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/80771/dungeon-raiders]Dungeon Raiders[/url] is SO much better. I had no clue that Boss Monster was a Kickstarter project until I started cruising the game comments, and now I can't believe I thought it was anything else. 

The game is like the horrific scene from 1978's [i]Invasion of the Body Snatchers[/i] where a pod victim - after being freshly duplicated - is shaken by a concerned friend and crumbles to dust. There just isn't anything there. At all.

It's unbelievable that a game this awful raised over two hundred THOUSAND dollars and besmirched the reputations of 5,000 overconfident KS supporters. How is there not a class action lawsuit, and why isn't all of BGG asking for representation?

As Ralph Nader would say, this game is unfun at any speed - and a recall is most certainly in order.

I am so disappointed by this game.. It was my first Kickstarter and the idea was awesome (for a Dungeon Keeper lover like myself). Unfortunately, playing the game was not as exciting as I was hoping (for example, there are too many copies of the same cards that make you feel as if you can't really customize your dungeon as you would like).
Initial rate was 6.5 (Oct 2013), reduced to 4 (Aug 2015) because I don't feel I want to play it again soon.

I picked up this game as I really like the incorporation of video game elements into a card game.  I think it achieves what it sets out to do.

The components are pretty standard - cards of standard quality.  The artwork, however, is what outshines!  If you have fond memories of old-school video games, then you will most certainly love the artwork on these cards! 

The game play is loads of fun!  It scratches a nice itch, but it will not be for everyone.  Also, since this game begs to be played, expect for it to wear out fast.  To me, I think that says something positive about not only the replayability factor, but also the level of enjoyment it provides.

Take it for what it is - a light strategy, fast and extremely thematic take on old-school video games.  You won't be disappointed and at the very least, amused.

An interesting game with a simple enough premise. I've had a little difficulty explaining the game to new players, but once they get it, it works very well and has great flow. Well, except for the whole initiative/XP system. Doesn't mesh well with traditional turn orders.

Nice game, although probably gets old fast. The game needs more of everything: bosses, rooms, spells & heroes. Graphic design is great and is one of the selling points for this game. There are lots of nice details in the cards, but after seeing those cards couple of times, they'll lost their splendor.

Lukewarm about this one. Felt like being hemmed in by a huge crowd at Disneyland--like there was fun happening somewhere else but I couldn't seem to get there. On the plus side, the pixel art was gorgeous and often hilarious. I had a strange hankering to take the components and turn them into a completely different game. If only I had an iota of game design talent. Oh well. 

On the bright side, I introduced a couple I know to several games, including this one, and to my surprise it turned out to be their favourite. So my copy of Boss Monster has gone to a good home. :)

(Don't seem to be having much luck with Kickstartered video-game-themed boardgames - Super Dungeon Explore got a surprising 'meh' from us too.)

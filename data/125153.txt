RATING: 9.7
Clever techniques to avoid player downtime and encourage interaction. Very limited random elements is a drawback but deliberate, themey action options keep it from feeling like a victory point salad. Great game for people normally plagued with AP, as each decision is essentially limited to only two options. Starting initial conditions are varied just the right amount.

A clever, thematic game with fabulous production quality.

I admire the design and the way the game operates, but for me there was too much to take in, so I really didn't know what strategy I should try to follow.

For our first (4 player) game it took close on 5 hours to complete, by the time we'd waded through 90 mins of setup and rules.  The expected mid-game scoring for a ticket pile depletion didn't happen because the bag unexpectedly emptied of meeples.

For virtually every move we had to refer to a very useful member-created player aid which detailed step-by-step all the things you had to do for each worker you placed. If we skipped looking at the aid we tending to forget one of the 7 or 8 things you had to remember to do, in the right order.  Without that aid we'd have been all over the place, so a big thank you to user schnel and his aid found here: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/126498/one-page-player-aid-gallerist-version-10

Although the kicked-out worker feature seems pretty neat, it does disrupt the flow of play and can result in a fair bit of downtime before your turn comes round.  And with only four worker placement spots the kicked-out action happens quite a lot (in a 4 player game, maybe it wouldn't with fewer players).

A great game but too many fiddly rules with a plethora of possible end game bonuses to try to choose from means I'm not hurrying to play it again.

Having only played Kanban before this (in terms of Vital's designs) I am starting to get a feel for his designer fingerprints. Very intricate Euros; apparently simple decision trees with blossoming webs of possibilities leading off of them. The theme comes through well enough though not as strongly as in Kanban, but the decisions are indeed wonderful. Everything clicked halfway through and I'm really keen to give this another go and re-evaluate.

edit: 3 plays in and still just scratching the surface. I particularly like the shared incentives aspect of promoting artists, and the variety of constraints to be juggled (commissions, assistants, visitors etc).

RATING: 8.04
Another Beautiful game from Vital's little workshop. I am always pleasantly surprised by themes he picks for his games and then executes them perfectly. You really feel like you own a posh gallery while playing this game. On another note, kicked-out actions are cool, but kind of corrupt the natural flow of the game, so the fluidity is compromised in yet another Lacerda game. This is the only major flaw because it can lead to big downtime and AP moments.

RATING: 10
Heavy strategy game with mechanisms that make sense thematically. Everything is connected and the game is elegantly designed making it rather easy learning the rules and getting started. Superb quality components and beautiful visual design enhances the thematic feeling of this rather dry (in a good way) game. If you like low chance european style games that allow you to feel creative and that reward both tactical and strategic thinking, this might be for you.

I will keep it. Forever. Can't stop thinking about it.

More thoughts after more plays: Everything is so damned interconnected in this game that making a really informed decision requires time... This game has felt heavier the more we've explored it. Actually, if heaviness is judged by factors that should be taken into account when in making a decision, it's the heaviest I've played.

Played twice so far and enjoyed the game both times. While this game is very deep in strategy and is by no means an easy game to win, the Gallerist is also not a particularly hard game to teach. I had previously played Lisboa, which took about an hour to teach and  really required referencing the player booklets to make sure things were done correctly. The Gallerist is far more streamlined, while sacrificing rather little in depth. The theme is also extremely enjoyable and of course, it is an absolute aesthetic pleasure to play. On our second play, we found ourselves needing to look up far less symbols. There are a few small rules that we had forgotten between our plays and had to reminded of, but overall, it's clear that this a game that will not have to constantly be re-learned. We all enjoyed the kicked-out actions and the strategy of trying to manage reputation to use them well, as well as making sure you had something to do for both your main and your kicked-out action. The best part of this game is how all the systems work together, integrating with each other. It is quite reminiscent of Trajan,  which has a similar feel of "I want to do x - now which approach do I use to achieve it?" and also a similar 'choking scarcity' effect. In that game, it's achieved by the manacala, while in this game, the effect is caused by reputation and money limiting action availability. Happy to have this lovely game in my collection - might potentially raise it to a 10 if it holds up to replays.

After first play: the components are really great and thematic. However, it seems that in order to win the player should concentrate on visitors managements. All the main Gallery activities as discovering and developing of artists and buing and selling of work of art are less important that having the right combination of visitors on the lobby and in the Gallery for receiving lots of money and influence during the game and at the end of the game.

If there is one boardgame to describe myself, it would be The Gallerist! Boardgames with personal player board (and a beautiful one I must add) always excites me and The Gallerist is no exception.
Everything you do in the game is full with theme. You can only commissioned one artist at a time and you can buy their work of art at the initial fame cost. An artist can only have at most 2 work of art on display because of their inspiration limitation (haha). As you buy their work of art, more visitors will come to the plaza & the artist fame will increase as well, and it also depends on how many collectors in your gallery & how much influence (per fame icon) you want to use to increase his fame. You can promote the artist using influence (per fame icon) at the media center. Once you have matching contract, sell the work of art & the buyer (1 of the visitor in your gallery) will go back to plaza. The more you sell works of art, the more collectors will flock your gallery! When you have visitors in the lobby, you can send your assistants to the international market to build reputation or bid for renowned work of art and gain you more money at the end of the game the more assistants you have there. It's all very thematic & full with satisfaction!
There's one time during the game where I was almost out of options, I don't have anymore money thus I cannot do auction or hire new assistants, I don't have anymore assistant to build reputation at international market, I have 3 unfulfilled contracts, I have 3 work of arts in my gallery but none match the contracts thus I cannot sell them and none of the artists is a celebrity so I cannot use the masterpiece slot for any of my existing work of art before buying a new one and I can't discover any artist because I still have one commissioned artist under me. Luckily after calculating all the available options, I have enough influence (per fame icon) to promote an artist, thus opening up new options for me. Stuff like this really makes The Gallerist shining through with its richness in theme.
During the final rounds of the game, I promote 1 of the artist I discovered to celebrity status because I have his work of art, forgotten that my sister also has his work of art at her gallery, which gave her extra money as well. A mistake that shows how connected the gameplay and theme is. Although this was our first play, especially for my sister, since I did read the rules & watched some videos prior to playing the game, our scores were not that far apart from each other 161 to 139! Sign of a good and balanced game, unlike FCM.
Our first play concluded in about an hour plus and we did some mistakes like putting the starting reputation tile at the wrong place (not the 3rd slot of our gallery), using each influence to increase artist fame instead of per fame icon, wrong interpretation of collectors rule, assistant may come from the office or other location but not from contract bonus which can only be used once and probably we didn't send the visitor from our gallery/lobby to the plaza one or two time after selling work of art/take reputation tile, and also forgot to increase influence at the international market, but overall, it's a great learning game!
The downside of the game is that the kicked-out actions & executive actions make the game longer, more complex & complicated than it already is. Probably after some playtesting, the designer decided to make the action to move visitors & use contract bonus as exec actions. The kicked-out action is quite innovative but it does make the gameplay a bit messy & befuddling.
I also learned that the symbol of both VIP & collector increasing influence is called a "party" and the symbol of both investor & collector increasing money is called a "meeting". The brown investor is related to money, the pink VIP is related to influence & the white collector is related to fame. Nice little details!
Discover artists, buy works of art, promote artists, sign contracts, sell works of art, hire & send assistants to international market whether to build reputation or bid for renowned work of art. it's all in a day's job of The Gallerist! This is a boardgame to be played in a sophisticated approach & environment. One of my personal favourite alongside Terra Mystica! Absolutely the perfect birthday present for myself!

LIKE: Great interaction when jockeying for an artist and then have someone else help build them up. The bump out action was an interesting mechanism because players have open information, allowing players to plan ahead a little to prevent others from taking advantage of free actions. I enjoyed how the visitor meeples worked. Unique theme.

DISLIKE: The first turn felt a little scripted. Simple rules, but complicated edge cases and rules that are difficult to remember. The board looks busy at first.

OVERALL: I had my doubts, but it's an impressive, solid game. It seems intimidating at first, but it simplifies after a few rounds. I would play this again, plenty of strategies to try.

This would be a 10 if it wasn't so heavy on the rules - not that it's hard to learn, there's just a volume of rules to remember. Teaching new players is an ordeal. Otherwise it's such a beautiful and balanced game and we adore playing it.

1 Partida, que he ganado, y aun así íbamos todos muy perdidos, este juego se aprende tras varias partidas, te lees las reglas y te quedas un poco medio igual, y eso que éstas reglas están más claras y ordenadas que el Kanban. Me ha gustado más que el Kanban, y a la vez, tienes la sensación de estar jugando exactamente el mismo estilo de juego, pero no vas tan perdido. Juegos que son muy complejos para ser profundos, y hay juegos que con reglas más sencillas consiguen incluso mayor profundidad. Además es muy frío el juego, muy poca interacción e indirecta, salvo la de mover a otros que vayan a la galería contraria, hacia la tuya, que apenas sucede, no da tiempo. Gusta pero no apasiona, extremadamente euro seco.

The game felt overproduced, underdeveloped, and with one or two viable paths to success. In fairness, after a few turns, I lost all interest in the experience.

Congratulations to Vital Lacerda for this intricate, some might say daunting, ecosystem of gamer's-game style interactions. I can't wrap my head around the complexity of Vital's design genius.

RATING: 6.5
I'll be honest. This game was on my chopping block as an example of something completely opaque that I just wasn't willing to battle into submmission. I'd only played it two player though, and this play through with Charlotte, David and Karl was a world apart.

The values of the art pieces were variable, we anointed a bunch of celebrity artists (sorry, future panel shows) and generally a brain burny but good time was had by all but one of us.

Just teaching it is a serious undertaking and isn't helped by all the focus on thematic interactions between influence, fame and art prices being totally undermined by the hilariously dry and Eurogamey Area control game over in the "international market". I have learned to leave that until last when teaching which means it jars quite a bit by the time you get there but at least doesn't derail the whole thing.

RATING: 7
Edit: I have come across a playthough video on youtube and I felt like I have not done justice to this game. Would love to give it another go.

I am not too sold on the bumping mechanism and only having just a single worker. The added complexity does not necessarily translate into more enjoyment. I do however find the theme to be quite captivating and mechanics do complement the theme. The graphic design and art work is just superb. I ended up giving this one away as it was just not getting enough plays.

Extremely euroey, but the theme feels entirely divorced from the mechanics. I feel like I'm pushing cubes for 3 hrs, not running an art gallery at all. I mean, that's fine, but still. The interconnected nature of all the systems seems like it should be fun but in practice it just feels frustrating and like work more than anything. No game I have ever played requires more, "Oh wait, we have to go back, I can't actually do this entire turn I just did" than this one.

The production is beautiful and impressive, but I don't need to ever play it again. (this fell from an 8 to a 5 for me in 3 plays)

Played Tim's copy 3 handed - It's a clever worker placement games with no real idea of who is winning until end game bonuses applied because they are a huge part of the score. Although there are only a few things you can do each turn I found it really hard to build a strategy and spent the game taking each turn opportunistically. Sadly the them didn't really grab me so it was just a case of moving meeples about

RATING: 6
This is a complex euro with an enjoyable theme and aesthetic.  

I admire the originality of the design which provides for a worker placement which, if it displaces another player's worker, thereby gives that player a modest, out of turn order, possible action to take.  Does this result in a somewhat peculiar rhythm for the game?  Yes, somewhat.

The end game goal in the game is to finish with the most money (not my favorite end game goal), and as such, worker placements which provide you with money, now, and in the future, are always on your mind. An alternative thing to strive for in the game is influence, which is tallied on an influence track, and spent during the game to get actions, or boost artist reputations, etc. I liked that aspect of the game.

The movement of people (meeples) into and out of lobbies and galleries is clever though perhaps a little less interesting than it seems it should feel.  This IS a spatial challenge, or is it?  Are we competing here spatially?  Perhaps.  Maybe not.

All in all, I really want to give Gallerist an 8, as I have for Kanban, a game I do love, but after one play, Gallerist just didn't quite grab me, or make me smile as much as Kanban did.  

As such, my enthusiasm for playing a second game of Gallerist is about a 7, not an 8.  Nevertheless, I am hoping that on second play, the gaming experience will improve to an 8.  November 2015.

Second play was an improvement, and in consideration of the clever design, particularly the influence track, and the amusing paths to gaining money and influence in various places on the board, going to raise it to an 8.  December 2015.

For better or worse, there is just not that much interest in playing in this game, and a third game just played, really left me flat.  The gaming experience is just not that pleasant, leaving little desire to play this one, so going to have to decrease my rating to a 6,  October 2017,

I like complexity. I love Dominant Species, which feels like chaos theory in action: many different variables combining into something expansive and beautiful. But the various mechanisms of DS are highly thematic. The Gallerist has similar complexity, but the mechanisms seem for the most part arbitrary and unthematic. With a few exceptions (investment in works of art, which are represented by very nice tiles) neither the components nor the mechanisms evoke anything about the world of art and art galleries. Renaming the game "The Gallerist's Accountant" might give a better sense of what the game is really aiming for, but I'm afraid even that makes it seem more exciting than it really is.

If you ignore the theme and just consider the skeleton of the game play, there are many better "point salad" games.

Based on first play.  Awesome worker placement game.  Very simple playing mechanics but very difficult decisions to make.  The core actions of the game are not hard to learn.  It's all the engine building and varying means of accumulating points that's challenging.  It'll take a few plays to come up the learning curve.  This one has the potential to break into my personal top 5 games.

Mechanically speaking, this is a worker placement game that may seem a bit dull on the surface. That's because players only have one worker in the game and there are only four worker-placement spots. Thus, if a player pawn hasn't been moved/kicked... a player only has a choice of 3-spots to go to. Sounds boring... right? 

Well the thing is, the limited choices help amplify the kickback mechanic, which is what really makes this game shine. See, if a player kicks your pawn (or an assistant) the kicked-player will then have the option to do a partial or full action. Thus, the entire mechanic encourages players to focus on each other and place their pawn/assistance in spots where they will get kicked off. But, as one can expect from a Vital Lacerda design, it's not that easy. That's because to utilize a full-action, players must go back on a track, which controls three different attributes (money, influence, and fame). Thus, taking advantage of a kickback action may have significant ramifications such as not having enough money, not having enough fame to manipulate an artist's reputation, and not being able to do another kickback actions. Therefore, manipulating this tract to capitalize on as many extra actions as possible is a huge aspect of this game... but it isn't an easy one and it isn't one that can be played with a solitaire mindset.

Overall, this isn't your typical euro. Combined with the shared incentivization aspect, the game feels much more interactive and engaging than many worker-placement games. Yet, it is still firmly within that "euro" stereotype with its low-luck, puzzly, and point-salady nature. 

Mechanically speaking, this is a heavy euro... but it has outstanding iconography and player aids, which makes teaching/learning/playing the game much easier. Seriously, I can't understate how wonderful the components are. Everything is produced to a very high level but not to the point where it becomes distracting or a hindrance to understanding the mechanics. This game simply pushes the envelope in both component and game quality.

With more plays, I can see my rating increasing. Wonderful game!

[UPDATE] After 6 plays... I'm bumping this up to a 9. This is just a wonderful game that provides a fluid, interactive, and dynamic experience. Everything from the kickback actions to how players can control the length of the game and intermediate scoring is simply wonderful.

Az egyik legnehezebb általam ismert játék, amiben minden mindennel összefügg. Kb. a Die Macherhez tudnám hasonlítani mélységre. Talán a Macher kicsit letisztultabb?! Néhány dolog itt már kicsit öncélú bonyolítás volt (amikor a kártyát még forgatom is, hogy a hátlapját is felhasználjam valamire:)), de ennyi elnézhető, mert összességében jól működik és sok elemében nagyon jól átjön a tematika. Ha valaki nem figyel, eléggé be lehet szorulni, nem egyszer előfordult, hogy valaki az akciók 2/3-át nem is tudta volna végrehajtani. Nem mellesleg nagyon igényes a játék kivitele! Igényes komplex játékok kedvelőinek KÖTELEZŐ! Ezzel együtt nem hiszem, hogy kedvencem lesz. Szerintem többet érdemes játszani rövid időn belül, tekintettel a tanulási görbére:)

Initial Impression: Once again, Eagle Games has put out a game with top-notch components. Not only is the molded insert highly functional, the plastic cover ensures that everything stays secure and snug. The game sports cardboard chits that rival FFG products in quality and thickness. The board is gorgeous, despite the muted colors, and not too busy. I found the actual pieces of art portayed in the game an eclectic and intriguing mix. Bonus points for the designer blurbs in the rulebook fleshing out the artwork's background. As for the actual gameplay ... wow! To be perfectly honest, this is my first Lacerda experience. I have to say that I now understand why many people love his designs. Despite the many moving parts, the design leaves the players with fairly simple choices every turn that result in a chain of ramifications. Best of all, each of the mechanisns in the game design make thematic sense. The overall result is an easy-to-teach, deep, complex game. My first experience at the game has left me tempted to add a copy of this wonderful game to my collection.

The Gallerist is another really good game by Lacerda. The primary core mechanism is conventional worker placement with a minimalist 4 locations. That familiar mechanism is layered with a non-blocking aspect that allows players the potential to take mini-turns while they wait for the next round. The actions of the 4 locations are linked to physically separate sub-systems on the main board that activate when a location is visited. 

Like many Lacerda games, the core mechanisms allow the game to play out fairly simply. The weight is largely due to the difficult decisions that result from the way in which those sub-systems are contingent on each other and glued together via the influence and money currencies. The game play is, for the most part, engaging and satisfying, but can result in slow rounds if certain player-types are at the table (Vinhos 2016 doesn't seem to suffer from this as much). Add in a good rule book, excellent production, and the welcome theme, and the Gallerist is well worth trying for those that like heavy strategy games. 

The International Market adds a lot to the game's dramatic table presence, but it does feel a little off from the rest of the systems in the game. It is basically a variation on Vinhos's international market, so maybe its the familiarity from Vinhos that is causing the issue with me, the rest of the mechanisms between Gallerist and Vinhos feel much different.

Score na eerste speling met Ilse.
Worker placement met één worker, waarbij je artiesten aantrekt, werken koopt en verkoopt, ondertussen hun reputatie laat groeien (en dus de werken duurder maakt), en ook je assisten wat aan promotie laat doen.
Ik had het spel iets mooier verwacht (voor die prijs, kost zowat 70 eur), en iets intuïtiever.  (Krijgt wel een score van meer dan 4/5 qua heaviness)
Ik wil het wel nog enkele keren spelen vooraleer een definitief oordeel te vellen, maar kopen doe ik het alvast niet.

First play: Long and fiddly set up taking c30 minutes with another 30 to explain the rules. The game comes with a very useful player aid which is essential to review and remember the options. A deep and brain burning game where the first play must be written off to grasp where the end game points come from. Overlapping mechanisms give multiple routes to resources and end game points. Will probably grow with further plays.

Second play and for some reason I had utterly forgotten every aspect of this game. Nothing came back and so we started from scratch. My previous comments still apply but I feel it is overly fiddly. Lots of add on rules and mechanisms which are easily missed or forgotten. So many bolt ons to the end scoring that assessing who is in the lead is near impossible mid game. 

Considerable effort went into the design of this game but it comes across as very dry.

My favorite of the Lacerda games I've played to date, slightly edging out Vinhos though not enough to get an 8. Kick-out actions are probably the most unnecessary rule addition in the game, especially since the kick-out sets you up to have a free placement next turn. Player aids are phenomenal, and theme is fresh.

RATING: 6.5
Beautifully produced game, little bit uncesessary complex for what it is, the mechanics could need some streamlining. The better game of Co2 and kanban. The game lacks development, you basically to the same things in round one as in the last rounds in the game so it gets little-bit repetitive. The game is better on fewer players since there is less kaos.

Half of the game is good, i wish the designer delivered 100%. The games main mechanic of getting bonus action from anticipating what other players will do drags down the game rather than enhance the gameplay. That mechanic creates percieved downtime. In a 4 player game, you could practically miss a turn if all other players get bonus actions and you dont get any. For me its just bad design.

So chunky and so elegant, yet gets a "way too heavy" stigma on BGG for some reason.  I would weight it at 3.75 tops, and feel that Dungeon Petz and Alchemists are heavier... or maybe just harder to teach.

I think that learning the sub-steps of the 8 action selections is key, and one play-through is almost required to see how everything flows... but so sweet once you get it.

Climbing the charts as one of my favorites.

Well, I had been looking forward to playing this. Was even more excited after getting the game in the mail. The box is gargantuan and the component quality is off the charts. Sat down to learn the game. The thing is, for all the hype, there has always been something that seemed a little off for me about the game. I couldn't figure it out. After reading the rules and watching a few videos it still seemed very unclear to me how one should go about playing this game. I still had that feeling while playing it. On one hand it was quite fascinating. The influence track and the kickout actions are quite innovative. On the other hand, your success seem quite dependent on how others play the game. This is of course the case in all worker placement style games, but whereas in most worker placement games, the actions of the other players either hurts you (by blocking your spot) or does nothing (takes a spot you wouldn't have taken), in this game it is the other way around. Nobody can take a spot from you, other players either do nothing for you or they actively help you, by bumping you from a spot giving you a kickout action or by buying pieces of art from an artist that you also have art from, boosting the value of your own piece of art. It's defintely interesting and different from what I'm used to, but while I was hoping to love it, it was more a case of finding it interesting. I most definitely want to play it again, but the rating of this is up in the air. Maybe I'll see the light and it'll become a favourite or it could be a complete flop. Time will tell. I will say this in its favour: it is definitely not just another euro and that is a good thing!

RATING: N/A
The more I think about this game, the more I think my one play experience has hindered my view of the game. The gist of it is that I felt the extra "kickout" actions slow the game because it reduces players' ability to plan the sequence of their actions which are critical to success. Ultimately, this causes a slower-than-necessary game which is AP-inducing. I don't think I'll play it again because of that. I wonder if I would have had a similar feel about Kanban had I experienced something similar on my first play. I do think the overall flow of the game is a bigger problem with the Gallerist.

RATING: 9
This was, for a time, my least favorite owned Vital game (behind Vinhos and Kanban).  However, it has been edging up ever since.  It is probably the least immediately intuitive (I think likely due to the theme) but repeat plays really, really opens this up.  I love it now.

Update: This can drag at 4-player and overstay its welcome.  Everyone has to know the game and be snappy players or the downtime and overall length gets a bit excessive for a game that doesn't have a feeling of escalation.

I saw this at Essen and wanted to buy it but it was 8 lbs, too heavy to pack in suitcase. That night I preordered it from Funagain games and got it in the mail 1 month later. 
Edit 1/2016. I have since played this game 3 times, and would play it more if the game was shorter (and more than 4 players). 
The mechanics seem to follow Vital's style: you do a simple action and there are many chain re-actions that follow. Which a very good thing in the type of games I like to play.

This game does so many things right. The length of the game is just perfect so that you cannot achieve everything. This makes decision more rewarding.

The theme and mechanics work well together. A lot of thought went into making the mechanics make sense when running your art gallery.

A bit heavy. Your first play through you will make a lot of mistakes which may be discouraging. If you like strategy games I encourage you to give this one a shot!

I am a big fun of Vital Lacerda's games. In my opinion he perfectly combines euro style game with the theme. This is the example of this great combination. Every action you can take in Gallerist and every consequence of that action is justified and has it's reference in real world running of art gallery. You feel the theme while playing and thats rare for the euro game. Apart from that it is a solid and beautifully designed game. One of my favourites.

Fantastic, heavy Euro. Superb components and integration of theme throughout the many aspects of this game. Could easily feel like a disjointed point salad, but the integrated design and theme tie everything together into a package that doesn't dissolve under the weight of its myriad of combos and options. On top of this, downtime was minimal although we played with four players. 

We didn't finish our first play, one of our group had to leave. But we likely would have been done inside 45 minutes thus giving a first 4-player play, where only one of us had played once before, done in under 3 hours. The amount of meaty "gameplay" that we got in that chunk of time was phenomenal. Can't wait to play again.

This is an interesting mix of mechanics that is NEARLY too much.   I think it's right at the very edge of my tolerance as far as complexity goes.   Whereas Vinhhos and Kanban seem to go over that line for me, this one is just a little bit more accessible.

Still, it's a dense game and teaching it / setting it up seems to be a bit of an ordeal.   It's not a game I would own or ever suggest playing, but I did enjoy it.

I do really like the theme and the artwork.   The board I thought was very attractive and distinct, and the theme was also unique and things made thematic sense for the mostpart.

A wonderful game: beautiful components, challenging, tense gameplay, and a heavy but not too heavy rule set. Along with CO2, this is probably my favorite Lacerda game (and I could see this surpassing CO2 with future plays).

My favorite aspect of the game lies in all of the bonus actions: almost everything you do opens opportunities for other things to do. Hire an artist, and take a ticket. Go to the international market, make some money. Assign an assistant, boost your reputation. Each action can be chained to other actions to create awesome combos usually seen only in card games. Many decisions you make over the course of the game, then, are incredibly rewarding. Scoring is tight, and just uncertain enough that it's tense right up until the end. 

Probably my favorite game from 2015.

Another wonderful, crunchy Lacerda who is quickly becoming one of my favorite designers! Like some his other games, the gameplay is super simple as you simply choose one of 4 action spots to place your worker.

This was a monster of a game to play! Tough to learn but I think I got it right. I did have to double check myself with the help of a video, but think I got most of it correct on my own. You really have to play it through once in order to really understand why you are doing anything. It's like most worker placement games, you don't feel like you're accomplishing anything at the beginning and then you realize okay. I need to buy some art. In order to buy some art I need money. In order to get some money I need to do this or that. So then you have to start doing this or that and then try to remember the steps you needed to take to buy the art. Might be helpful with some scratch paper LOL! The symbols don't make too much sense right away. And there are some things that you earn and you think will what do I do with this? And it's just an endgame piece. Which was kind of hard to figure out for some things. It's not that the directions aren't clear, they are actually very good. But the rulebook is thick and clunky and if you are like me, you're a skim and play kind of person. So it's hard to go back and find things you missed. That is the downside of these new Euro games. They keep them symbol only so that they don't have to print multiple versions of cards and Boards in different languages. It would be so much more helpful if everything could be written right there for you. But that's okay. This game was a lot of fun. I can't see any of my friends wanting to play such an intense worker placement game, but I had a great time playing solo and would definitely Play It Again!

Another solid game from Vital Lacerda. I tend to dislike games with Byzantine resource conversion rules, and that are overly complicated, but he manages to make them thematic enough that the rules click fairly quickly, and adds enough creativity via extra actions and interaction via competition for bonuses that I always enjoy his games (CO2 excepted). His economies just feel right to me. 

I don't think it is quite as strong as Vinhos and Kanban, since the timing of when you get your extra actions is driven by the actions of other players, so there is slightly less control. This makes planning a little chaotic, but also forces you to think about what the other players are doing, which is good. Need more plays.

Great to implement the unique theme with innovative kick out actions.  Intensive competition and interaction with your opponents and it does not cause any direct confrontation. 
Heavy Euro with multiple paths.  Tense decisions to make in each steps.  Top notch component and carry the theme very well.  Solitaire mechanics is also good to implement for players to learn and master the game.  Just one drawback from my point of view; each action involves several pieces with tiny rules that are easy to forget.  A little bit time consuming to organize the game and re-read the rules after putting this game off the table for a long period of time and re-take it again.

RATING: N/A
Vital Lacerda is not my kind of designer, and so I knew upfront that this design would not sit well with me. Because I didn't complete the game I'm not going to rate the experience either. 

First off: the artwork has been given a lot of very thoughtful attention. I'm not too fond of the colour scheme, and at times despite having lots of board estate there is still a need for scribbly ratty detail (the fame tracks, for example, or the assistant bonuses), but overall the impression is one of ruthless consistency. That can't have been an easy thing to accomplish, nor done on a single rainy Sunday afternoon. Well done, Ian.

While playing I found myself drawing more and more parallels to the older Vinhos. The games share quite a few characteristics, or rather, it's not too difficult to imagine how Vinhos could be developed (and simplified!) further until you end up with something The Gallerist-like. Vinhos' quadrel with its strong negative undertone (paying for an action already taken, paying for taking steps) has been replaced by a positive structure where someone simply receives a bonus action. The wine renown cubes are now more elaborate fame tracks with various hurdles to determine sale value. The three wine experts who were always so [i]glad[/i] to take cheap vinegar off of your hands are now the three kinds of visitors... but visitors have also subsumed the various estate-enhancing aspects like the winery and oenologists. The weird domestic and international markets plus the wine fair have been amalgamated into a single international market (with a majority scoring mechanism) plus simple sales based on fame. The money track with its emergency withdrawals has been given a double function (both fame and money can be had here), but its chief purpose of emergency withdrawals remains. I'm sure there are other things I haven't considered. What you end up with is a game which does many things in a way reminiscent of Vinhos, but is more straightforward about it rules-wise. That is a Good Thing. So if you find yourself wondering which game to start out with: I'd advise The Gallerist.

But the core of a buy low-sell high system remains; and has been augmented with so many subsystems (discovery, fame increases, visitors, markets, contracts, international 'competition', assistants, ...) that one ends up with a system with Lots Of Stuff To Do. Which is exactly what the modern gamer craves. Just as with Vinhos there doesn't seem to be an alternative approach to playing the game: you're tied to the cycle that the designer put in, but can alter the sequence a little, and have to do better than your opponents. In that there is a strong component of simulation to The Gallerist as well: this is not, in any way, a sandbox.

Initial progress is of course glacial. You get but meager resources and have to slowly make your way to riches and fame so you can launch new artists with impunity and profit even more off them. This is nice for half an hour or so. Not for two hours. So I spent no more than half an hour and broke off the attempt at that point.

The execution is lavish to the point of insanity. What purpose does it serve to print the game bits on stock twice as thick as regular material? Why are there easels included when these do nothing but serve as thematic sauce for 'work of great renown'? Why are visitors in comparison so tiny? I guess it appeals to lesser minds who confuse 'production quality' with 'game quality'... but frankly, a regular box which isn't so big and doesn't weigh as much, would have been a solid alternative. I will say one positive thing, though: the plastic cover to hold all bits in place works. That's a nice touch worthy of being copied elsewhere.

And that's all I'm going to write about this title.

There is lot to like and it is meaty, but here are several things I don't like about it: there is no progression, it just seems to be more of the same, lather, rinse, repeat. It is very baroque, a typical Vital Lacerda (although better than some of his other games). And finally, for a game of this heft, it seems way too tactical.

Again, no final verdict yet, but it is tentatively on my trade pile.

Gee what is it with these high MSRP... do this people who pull these numbers out of their rear ends understand this is just a board game. The price fixing, floor pricing going on in this industry combined with $80-$100 are going to ruin the hobby. I am not sure who the target buyer is... get $100x10 is $1,000, 100 games $10,000. 

Going to pass on this. I rather used the money toward on a kayak.

Reiner Knizia's Modern Art is the best game about art ever made. Period. So with that out of the way, the following may not come as surprise ...

--------------------------

While I sort of admire Vital Lacera's continually-the-same-game design chops, I think that many of his game designs (and his fans) are confusing complexity of mechanics and crowded decision trees for depth and/or elegance, and that his designs seem to put work before fun. They tend to be a mis-mash of far too many mechanics and individual parts, with many of them feeling that they were simply tacked on to add processes to the game design, and the designs feature too many and often poorly thought through mechanics that are more complex than they need to be. 

His games seem to me ... as an award-winning visual designer of 25 years ... to lack any trace of having all the unnecessary design cruft [b]removed[/b]. It's almost as though he tries to add too many moving bits into his designs, and [i]then[/i] add the kitchen sink as well, in an attempt make his designs feel "heavy" or important when, in fact, they are only adding unnecessary complexity, fiddliness, and that slow the game down too much. That results in players having to focus on the mechanics of a game, more-so than the consequences of the decisions they make.

My own ratings of his games [i]to date[/i] would probably look something like this: Vinhos > CO2 > Kanban. Vinhos I enjoy playing, occasionally. CO2, on the other hand, is a game that I merely consider "meh" ... I could take it or leave it, but would rather [i]not[/i] ever play it again, despite outstanding visual design and theme. And Kanban? I actively and quite strongly dislike Kanban, a game I've been known to refer to as a "hot mess of mechanics that is inelegant, too long, and far to complex for what it is trying to achieve" (much like how I feel about the game Bruxelles 1893).

I had read a long time ago on the forums that The Gallerist was going to (finally) be a more medium-weight game, and have that polish and elegance that seem to be generally lacking in his other titles. That rumour, plus my love of art and the art world, got me really excited for the game. Then came the word that this wasn't the case, this was another heavy one is his usual wheelhouse, a game without question that followed his design patterns and apparent inability to simplify and remove mechanics that should probably be removed to improve flow and elegance. 

But, as I said, I am an art lover, I publish an art magazine, paint competently, know many artists, collect art, etc. I had some hope that despite it's complexity, The Gallerist's theme would help me feel better about the complex grinding gears Vital's games seem to feature. Both in terms of the weight of games I like and my own interests outside gaming, I [i]should[/i] be the target audience. I often deeply enjoy heavy games (when they are elegant designs). I enjoy games that make me smile and grin while I play them (Snowdonia, Keyflower, Inhabit the Earth, Power Grid, hell, I smile when playing Troyes). I never seem to do that when playing Vital's designs.

I played a four player game of The Gallerist as my first go ... probably not the best number for this game which, after thinking it through, would probably be best at three players ... enough conflict and interaction, without slowing the game down with the overly complex and game-slowing "bumped actions" rules. Even so, with rules lookups and some fiddliness, we managed to knock out a game in three hours. A great group of gamers played, so that always helps. So what do I think after one game?

Vinhos > CO2 > The Gallerist (provisionally) || Kanban.

I'm left generally disappointed (not unexpectedly) after the first game. It's another inelegant Vital design, ponderous, heavy (apparently) simply for the sake of being heavy. There is too much superfluous stuff that could have been removed to make the game smoother and flow better, too much complexity that hides the real essence of what this game's theme is fundamentally about ... run a gallery, buy art, sell art, profit and prestige. It could have been more elegant if the actions and gameplay had been better thought through and ruthlessly pared down. That would have increased the fun and lowered the mental work required to understand the mechanics, so that the strategy and depth of play were the focus. The end-game scoring is a mess of complexity that strikes me as [i]one of the most inelegant scoring flows I've recently encountered[/i] in any game. And it doesn't help that there is a contradiction in the rulebook versus the board's scoring track about whether or not to score sold art versus hanging art first, though I'm not sure that it matters score-wise which one is scored first in any case. 

Even more unfortunate, however, is that I can't make up my mind if the [i]scoring mechanic[/i] is more inelegant than the whole [i]international market/buying actions[/i], which seems to me to be the least elegant and most "tacked on" mechanic in the whole game. Wow. That whole set-up, with it's myriad of randomized bonus tokens that takes too much work to think through how each unique one might affect your long term prospects and end-game scoring. It is also a clear warning sign to me of a designer's inability to clarify and simplify their design, so that each piece of the whole works better and more smoothly, and the consequences and inter-connectedness of each player choice are clearer and more easily identified and understood. There is also no reason the gallery spaces need a lobby plus the gallery, that whole mechanic could have been simplified. Finally, the ability to be able to move meeples out of other people's galleries is, I find, simply a mechanic that was added to the game to complicate the game for no apparent reason except to add to player interactivity.

The visual design is very nice (that's my job, btw, so I appreciate elegant visual and information design) but the gameplay itself isn't a clean design. There are too many moving pieces again to get a handle on the mechanics that allow you to focus on playing the game, rather than the game playing you. 

For example, in The Gallerist, here's what I mean about simplifying to make game flow better: The design would have worked just as well and far more smoothly if, when you are bumped from one of the four spots on the board, you simply get a specific "bonus" for each of those four spaces, and you move your player marker back to your gallery. Money, prestige, increase and artist's reputation etc. Simpler and more elegant and smoother game flow.

I'll try it again ... much as I gave Agricola three full games before deciding I'd rather poke my own eyes out with a dull pencil or rusty spoon than [i]ever[/i] play that mess again. You know, to give it a really fair shot, but perhaps with only three players for the next go. 

I probably won't ever buy a copy even though the art/gallery theme is right up my alley ... err, which I suppose will make actually playing it a second time rather difficult, since I don't know very many gamers in my neck of the woods who like and own his games (anyone want to play in the K-W area?) ... unless it seriously clicks for me on the second play in the same brilliant way some of my other mid-weight Euros did after a single play or two (La Granja, Tzolkin, Viticulture, Mombasa, Nippon, London, Brass etc). I didn't find it anywhere near as enjoyable as another heavier game I was recently introduced to such as 1846, which is a far, far better designed and elegant game. Plus as I've been moving into my mid-50s, I find myself reducing my collection to gems I absolutely love ... there's no room on the shelf anymore for fiddly, complex, work>fun games that aren't elegant and deep that I don't absolutely love playing (I've gone from a collection of 1,000+ to 350 to "only" 80 in the past ten years).

I would love to see a design in the future from Vital that is far more polished and less complex. I would have liked to see Vital have designed this game so that it was meant to be played in 90 minutes. I'd like to see him ask himself, as all of us designers must do in the course of any type of design, what could he [i]remove[/i] from a design to make that game cleaner, more elegant, and flow better. But maybe he simply can't do this type of game design? But if Rosenberg can create Merkator (which I enjoy) or the lighter delightful game that is Patchwork, surely Vital can recognize and perhaps finally try to break out of his unfortunate "kludgy-heavy" design patterns. A medium weight, elegant mechanic game from Vital would be a must-have, I suspect.

Even more, in my fantasy land of "what-if?", I would have absolutely loved to see what The Gallerist [i]could have been[/i] if it had been designed by someone like Tony Boydell, Richard Breese, Mac Gerdts, or the brilliant Reiner Knizia (whose best two masterpieces are Samurai and the simplest but most elegant art-related game ever made, Modern Art), or even what it would have liked like in the hands of a designer I run hot and cold on, such as the "point-salad king" Stefan Feld.

The Gallerist is another (failed) case of complexity in mechanics pretending to be a deep/elegant game. The art/gallery theme actually does work, but the game overall fails to be elegant or fun, sadly, as much as I really wanted to really love it. It is, thankfully, a better game than Kanban, but not by enough in my opinion.

P.S. This is the only game that when I look at my Geekbuddy ratings, I wonder what game those folks were [i]actually[/i] playing, because it sure wasn't the same game I was playing. 8? 9? Clearly some sort of medication was messing with their judgements.

This game may be too much for me.  I love the design, love the look of the game, and quite enjoy playing it.  It is perhaps just a little too opaque for me.  I find it hard to come up with a grand plan and see how all of the wheels interconnect, and how the end state of the game results from my early choices. 

Plus, it feels really restrictive - you want to do this, but you can't because you don't have a dude in your lobby, or you don't have any money, or you've already discovered someone, or it's the action you just did, or...  Maybe I just don't know how to make this run smoothly yet.  Maybe one less mechanism or area and it would be more manageable.

It doesn't help that some of the actions aren't terribly thematic, and you just do them to get a bonus.  Sure, it's cool to set up combos, but don't people praise this game for being thematic and elegant?  There's a lot I just don't understand, theme-wise, in this game.

Still, I like how the pieces fit together, and will be happy to keep playing this.  I don't think I'll need another Lacerda game, though; one complex machine should be enough.

I’m becoming convinced that Lacerda's games are too complex for their own good.

I've played this twice and I still feel like my actions are mostly random and their effect on the outcome of the game are immaterial.  I'm sure there is a way to play this game in a meaningful way, but if I literally have no idea how to plan or execute even a bad strategy after playing the game twice I don't really see the need to get to that point.

In comparison, I played Vinhos once, and loved that game.

This game is nearly a perfect worker placement game. It can play in about 2 hours, scales across the play counts and has enough puzzle about the best ways to string together actions to make money selling art. The theme is unique and the components are very well done. Visually a striking game that attracts attention when it's pulled out. My one complaint is signature token system for tracking the value of the art is a bit fiddly. The price points are constant for all players so maybe a centralized board with the pricing a single place to track them would have been better.

[14 Sep 2017] - 8 (14 plays)
There's a lot to like in this game. A tight worker placement mechanism, colorful board and tough optimization decisions. The game drags at 4 players when everyone is bumping everyone else and can make it tough to keep track of play. Much more manageable at 2-3 players. I do feel like some of the opening moves are fairly scripted. Players need to be buying artwork, discovering artists or securing contracts right away. Mid game tends to see focus on the markets, promotion and assistant spots. There's a lot to navigate to make the system work but it does feel like there is an arc to the game with the big decision being timing of moving into the next phase. That's why I dropped the rating a bit. I would much rather play this over other lighter worker placement games.

I really enjoyed my first play. At the end of Kanban I still had little idea how the game worked, I always felt like I was fumbling in the dark, right up to the end. In The Gallerist I feel I could easily teach the game after a single play. I think the bgg weight rating of 4.2 is really exaggerated. I'd say it's more like a 3.5.

That said, it's a good solid heavy euro. It may not have a ton of strategic variability, but it should be enjoyable for many plays regardless.

This game is amazing on so many levels. All the mechanics are enforced by the theme and make sense. Nice deep complexity. No game feels the same as it has a sort of sandbox nature to it as the game is steerded by the actions of the players. A lot of player interaction in a very positive way unlike anything I've seen in other games. Just amazing. Love this game.

Beautiful game with top-notch components (at least the KS version I played). It's not hard to play (but probably hard to play well).

The game it self left me quite cold, after some hours I was rather bored I must admit as I knew more or less what I hoped to the next five turns and just waited for the other players to do their stuff that probably wouldn't affect my turn anyway. The game never felt crowded or had any turn angst which was a bad thing here.

I like the kick out mechanism, even though it makes turn order confusing at times, but there's a little too much downtime in the game with four players at least.

Its a heavy game with a lot of stuff going.  Very thematic,  Very tight economy.  The ticket system felt very loose though.  You can use tickets very/too so easily maybe there is some subtlety we missed.  Looking forward to next play.  We got a good laugh at over produced wooden stands that are only used to display the end game paintings that you select.

Update...after 6 plays and finally my first win...bumping this up to a 9.  Nice replayability.  My only concern is if turn order (going first) is a big advantage

Mechanics, theme, art, all there. My main gripe is that some things are imbalanced for 2p - it's very difficult (imho) to get one, let alone two artists to masterpiece-level for the end of game condition. Being able to "sell" everything in your gallery during scoring is awful - basically removes challenge of balancing gallery near the end. Also, curator/director cards are boring and need more variety (at least 8 different ones, 4 is a joke). Rep tiles/international market feels tacked on.

I love a complex Euro, but The Gallerist is for me an example of what is wrong with many weighty Euros. It has a lot of fiddly complex mechanisms which don’t relate intuitively or indeed very effectively to each other. As a comparison to what I would consider a successful complex Euro: in Madeira everything is tied together into a wonderful seamless whole, whereas here we have a bunch of disparate things going on and the mechanics are not not clean and straightforward. Further turn order gets confusing as sometimes players have the opportunity to take a minor action out of turn sequence.

It feels like it needed an editor to tidy and tie everything up and make things run more smoothly. A game in need of a touch of Kramer and Keisling’s reductionist touch perhaps?

The last third of the game also seems to become more limited as the tickets run out meaning you can’t get people to the right place in the gallery. The options are reduced and you end up willing the game to end as it drags itself to a close.

Maybe some of my reaction is simply disappointment since I quite enjoyed the game I played, though it was long (4 hours). And the game looks amazing with its rich palette of quality materials for the components. 

Overall then a long and complex Euro, possibly too complex in its mechanics.

I have the same issue with the Gallerist as I do with Brass - this is a game I can respect, and one that I would say is bordering on greatness, but when I completely disengage halfway through it (and still win by a long shot), I find it hard to personally recommend this.

I won't deny that this is a meaty game with a pretty terrific depth in strategy, two things I really enjoy, but there's simply no [I]fun[/I] to be found here for me.  Like Brass, I find the game to be an incredibly long exercise in problem solving with little gratification.  I think part of it is that there is just too much to do and really no way of gauging the competition - except for the "kicked-out" mechanism, this is pretty much everyone at the table doing their own thing and even if you're bumped, so long as you're managing your resources correctly, you'll have plenty of extra actions to take on top of your normal turn.

As this bumping seems to be the hook of the game (minus the terrific production quality and the neat - if somewhat pointless - easels), my biggest comment is that the complexity of the game really just turns this whole thing into a chore.  On your own proper turn, you can easily spend a lot of time agonizing over what to do.  Get bumped and suddenly you're agonizing over what to do out of sequence.  The game is just too complex (not complicated, mind you) for this kind of mechanism to be engaging.  Rather than something like, "bump me, I can kill a gnome or save a gnome", it's a lot more like, "bump me, I can kill the gnome, but I could spend time using poison, or get into a car and run over it, or cement its hidey hole, or shove its hat down its throat... or I could save it and make it a pie, or negotiate a mortgage contract with it, or convince it to sign over power of attorney for its collection of underpants," and all of those would be separate end results that could branch from three choices that exponentially branch as you move on.  It's enough of a damned COURTESY that you ought to be planning your turn when it's not your turn, but now you have to also plan for the possibility that you could get an extra turn on top of that.  And the thing is, these kinds of things work in so many [I]other[/I] games, but to me, it doesn't work in the Gallerist.

But here's the thing - it works [I]mechanically[/I] and there is nothing inherently wrong or broken with the way the game is designed, but I am not its audience.  This is a game that is purely soaked in its mechanics, theme be damned, and that's fine.  I've played plenty of JASEs and had some fun.  This one's design philosophy seems to be, "joy in moving parts."  If you are the type of gamer that likes to do things simply because they are there to do and you actually like to simple twiddle knobs and flick switches, then this is your kind of game.  

I don't need a theme, but I need a reason, and the Gallerist never gave me one.

RATING: 3
I'm not sure if a 3 is to high or to low for this. I wouldn't put it below a 2 for sure, and I doubt it should be over a 4. If they didn't let people directly steal your meeples, I might give it as high as a 5. 

The board looks decent. The pieces representing the art are awesome. The game play is ok, if clunky and not at all interesting. The rules were dense, but individually fairly easy to understand, if not memorize for the sheer number. There are a number of elements that make this game more like a random war game than what you would really want it to be. It is way to long for the random and direct conflict pvp aspects that it incorporates. 

The first few actions seemed to highly encourage people to purchase art. This might not have to be one of your earliest actions, but it definitely seemed like one of the best options, nearly to the only real option. At any rate, the first player gains a significant lead here from getting first choice of art and then potentially able to buy a 2nd before the 3rd player even gets to go. Its all very clunky and feels very unfair.

People can steal, or lure away your patrons in your lobby, which hurts both players at least to a certain degree, often the opponent has a choice of which player he wants to attack in this way. This type of needless stealing from other players is always a mark of a bad game. Its totally acceptable in a 2 player game or a short light game, but a 2 hour "Euro" type game, it made me hate the game before I even took my first move.

The bonus you receive for buying a painting varies dramatically, again mostly just from luck of the draw. You can get 1 or 2 tickets, effectively the person before or after you may well just receive double what you got. Additionally, the bonus you give to the artist ranges from 0-2, again, just luck of the draw as to if the better bonus is available to you or not, hey free money/points. 

There is more direct player combat in the area of which artists get promoted. If other players simply buy from the other available artists, yours will be severally handicapped by the end of the game. There is a similar serious just design flaw to container, it isn't anywhere near as bad in this game though. Because of the general lack of options, most artists do get bought up. Though I will say, no one bought the 2nd piece from one of my artists and it did definitely stick the artist in the mud to be worth half the other ones (it was randomly the only artist not to get a 2nd art bought).

The free actions didn't seem particularly fair/balanced either. There were a large number of times that player were able to get free actions, that essentially paid for themselves in prestige, again, because people just happened to kick them out in a timely manner. The partial actions were fine, but the full actions that then sometimes even gain prestige for taking them was a bit ridiculous. I guess there is an argument that the broken mechanic is ok because everyone can do it.

The sales cards again come out randomly, and almost everyone chose to take 4 random ones and get stuck with one instead of taking one of the picked over cards. So it seemed over 80% of the time, the more attractive play was to play the lotto. 

There is a fairly sizable first player advantage. Considering they tend to get better early choices, they get pushed out of the spot they go to more often in the early rounds, allowing for potentially more actions and again, better actions. The later players get a token benefit of choice of bonus markers, but I don't feel this is nearly enough to make up for the first mover bonus earned in the very early rounds. The later players don't enjoy any real tactical bonus later in the game for taking the last turns. There probably should be at least some small bonus to later players, perhaps prestige or gold.

RATING: 6
Without question the most exquisitely produced board game to ever hit my table. The board conveys oodles of information, but the layout is very clean and logically organized, and the crisp graphic design adds to the overall aesthetic without creating distraction. From a gameplay perspective I find that the strategies are very delicate, and hinge on a specific order of operations, which isn’t a criticism in itself, but turns into one due to the kicked-out actions. While being strategically fascinating, these actions too often interrupt game flow and force players to constantly piece back together their next few moves in a manner that is more frustrating than satisfying. Instead of adding a tactical level of player interaction, they create a frustrating downtime issue, and exacerbate the game's overall length problem. Overall, despite the slow and methodical gameplay, each and every decision provides a satisfying crunch.

Upon opening up this game...

First, I was struck by the incredible quality of the components -- including real works of art incorporated into the game? Seriously?! 

Then the evident thoughtfulness which clearly went into the wonderfully functional insert (I wish all games came with such inserts!).

Finally, after punching out and organizing things a bit, I started tentatively easing into the game itself. Hmmm... an excellent rulebook, a functional (and beautiful) board, a viable solitaire mode included...

And then the game began to open up, allowing me to glimpse the dazzling depths of its terrain: e.g., countless and seamlessly interlocking mechanisms forming the foundation of a multi-layered fabric of dynamically interweaving threads; a wide array of synergistic action-effect chains, underlying an abundance of tactical options aligning with several evident strategic approaches; a resulting broad palate of paths to victory; and then the theme actually intertwining nicely with and shining brightly through the gameplay... 

I actually just paused at one point, speechless. It was breathtaking. I was smiling.

Then it struck me: this game itself is truly a work of art.

It's the box - 16"...  great prod val though. Superb with 4!
The weight of this game is just perfect. The logic, the flow, and even the design make a great gaming experience. Here's one thing that really makes this one stand out. Often making a worker placement choice is a matter of selecting the option that optimizes end-game points.  However, here the full implication is not always evident at the time the choices are being made. As a result, the decision is not as straightforward and it requires making probabilistic choices and that thinking process is fun.  Getting bumped for extra actions also factors in.  So well balanced and it all comes together in such an excellent way.  More plays may move thus one to a 10.

RATING: 7
Thematically speaking, you discover artists, pump up their reputation, then either collect their work for your gallery or sell it for a big profit. All the while you foster connections with people in the international art market that reap you short and long-term benefits. 

Gamewise, you buy a piece of art at a low price then take actions to increase the price so you can keep and score points at game end or sell during the game for money. You place meeples on a grid for both instant benefits and end of game VPs. 

You move your worker to one space on each turn to take one of eight possible actions. You (or your assistant) may get kicked out of a space you were in and then get a bonus action, so you make use of those extra actions to set up or cap off what you do/did on your own turn. When you leave a space, you can leave an assistant for the sole purpose of having her get kicked out.

A hallmark of Vital's games is that he builds in extra action opportunities for players to exploit (wines in Vinhos, bumped scientists in CO2, books in Kanban, and kickouts here). I love this element of design as it allows me to be creative in how I go about squeezing out some extra actions outside my turn. 

Here, you can use your kickout actions to set yourself up for something on your turn or finish something you already started. The challenge is in chaining together effective action strings through the use of assistants (extra actions) that effectively shorten the action chain, making you more efficient and able to start up a new action chain more quickly.

Top notch components.

Great interconnectivity between the different mechanisms  - as you'Ve (probably) come to expect from this designer. (I guess all of his games would have been dramatically streamlined in case they had been published by a German publisher :-)
I like this very much though. 
It beats me though, how people can say that this has a considerably lower "entry level" than Vinhos.

The "interruption" of the playing order initially irrited me a bit, after a while it was ok though.

I definetely need (and want) to play this again to make a sound judgement.

Jó kis játék, de nagyon nehéz. A szabály is jó egy óra elsőre, de neheze csak ezután jön. Játék közben minden összefügg mindennel, emiatt nagyon nehéz döntéseket hozni. A játékidő másodikra már egész tolerálható volt, kicsivel több, mint két és fél óra (hármasban). Jópár játékot bele kell tenni, hogy az ember felszabadultan tudjon játszani vele, szerintem nehezebb, mint a co2.

Die Kunst, ein unorthodoxes Thema als Brettspiel umzusetzen und dabei girlandenhaft die Wirklichkeit zu simulieren, ist die Handschrift von Vital Lacerda, die er diesmal in THE GALLERIST auch thematisch wörtlich nimmt: es gilt sein Geld in der Kunstwelt mit dem Kauf und Verkauf von modernen Kunstwerken zu machen. Auf der Basis von nur acht Galerist Placement Aktionen verlinkt sich wie von VL gewohnt allerhand Kleinteiliges in alle Richtungen zu einem organischen High End Erlebnis für Freunde von Optik, Haptik und Kalkül. Das Überbordende und potenziell Überladende seiner Spiele, das in THE GALLERIST auch materialistisch seinen sympathisch dekadenten Hochglanz erhalten hat, mag manchem Spielertyp, der geneigt ist, Mechanismen effizient entschlackt zu sehen, nicht gefallen, aber mir persönlich spielt der Kerl damit mitten in die Seele. Die vielen Plättchen, das ganze Gefizzel und Gefummel ist mir eine wahre Freude! Nichts am Vielerlei ist mir redundant und wird auf augenzwinkernde Art der beobachteten Wirklichkeit gerecht. Ich bin mir sicher: der Mann liebt Wein, sortiert seinen Müll, fährt gerne die sonnige Algarveküste im Cabrio rauf und runter und malt Bilder. Alles andere als ein softeispastelliges, gebundenes artsy fartsy Hochwertprodukt wäre THE GALLERIST nicht gerecht geworden. Nie klebte das Wort Gesamtkunstwerk markenlabelhafter auf einem Brettspiel als auf diesem übertriebenen, topkonfektionierten Wuchtkarton. Edel geht die elitäre Kunstwelt zugrunde in diesem - (Achtung Texterreflex!) - "Meisterwerk der Spielekunst".

RATING: 8
I love this game in so many ways. Love the theme, running an art gallery is so different and interesting to me. I can see where some would be bored by it, but not me. I love how deep the thematics play into the core mechanics of the game. If you get into the spirit of the game and give your gallery a name, and make up stories for your visitors...makes for a much richer experience. Its really not that hard to learn or understand...just feels overwhelming. but really, there is just 2 actions you typically do on your turn. There was just a couple of things I had issues with. 1st was the international market...it felt disconnected from the rest of the game experience and overly complicated. Why every other spot was super easy to learn use and understand, and this was like way off in left field?? And, There was entirely too many bonusus...might as well call this game "Bonus Master the game" I guess it made for fun end game scoring since you had no clue how you were doing really, and forget about trying to keep up with the other players. Overall, This is not a perfect game...but a game that is very enjoyable and thematically rich, that I could teach most people with ease.

Had no idea what to expect! I was worried after reading the rules that it would be a mess of a game. In the end, designer Lacerda manages to surprise me once more by taking what appears to be a slush of mechanisms and tightly interwoven moving parts and make the game flow easily (if you don't mind following several procedural steps for each action). Quite a feat! Co2 might still be my favourite VL game because of the theme and the tension the game engenders but The Gallerist works very well for those who enjoy heavier Euros with a unique theme and a fresh approach.  I wouldn't say The Gallerist elicits that kind of grin-worthy joy that I hope for in heavier games that require a lot of time dedication, but it creates a different sort of enjoyment if you like to burn your brain cells on many different options to ultimately achieve your goals.  Most brilliant is that for a Euro, it has a lot of soul (even with the diarrhea of symbols and bonuses and the like) but you can definitely create a story out of everything.  That's not easy to do in a Euro and especially one as intricate and complex as this.  So, not mind-blowing in the sense that it gives me a unique feeling that I can't get from any other game, but definitely mind-blowing in the design and how it all comes together. It's a keeper!

Beautiful game and fairly thematic.  It felt like I was doing the same things over and over with very little engine being built up to help.  Good points were the shared incentive to build up artists and subtle interplay of all of the different actions/tracks.  I'll probably never play it again, but it is certainly possible I'd grow to like it better with more plays.

I love it! Good lord, this game is incredible even solo. I'm marking this a 10 and I haven't even finished my first game. There are so many ways to complete a turn. To me it feels as much a brain burner as Mage Knight. If I ever win this game beyond apprentice level, I will be surprised. It's complex and if you like brain burners, this is it. Fair warning though, the analysis paralysis is incredible, and this game can take a lot of hours to play it. There are players out there who will be so much better at this than me because I can not hold too many moves ahead in my brain for very long. I have to go with my gut.

If you like Kanban, you'll like this.  This feels a little like Kanban but it's much more forgiving because the timing element (damned Sandra!) is removed.  This game is the epitome of point salad.  There are SO many ways to score that it's a litte out of control trying to keep track and trying to do the final scoring.  The art and components are very high quality but, man, this is a huge box.

Note: Plays best with 2 - takes WAY too long with 4 players.

Pros:
- the game flows very elegantly
- semi-collaborative feel as up to 2 players can invest in the same artist and develop him/her together for mutual reward
- the board is very colourful and all the different meeples give it life
- very thematic. Art in the game and art of the game are outstanding
- great player interaction with unique kick-out ability (player 1 occupying a space is given the opportunity to have an additional action if another player 2 comes in player 1's space rather than blocking player 2
- as a 3+ players game, I prefer The Gallerist than Vinhos Deluxe

Cons:
- faceless artists
- some actions are just more exciting than others (discovering artists or buying art)
- some actions do not feel as thematic as others, especially anything to do with the international market.
- as a 2 players game, I prefer Vinhos Deluxe.

A well-designed game with many good qualities. 

Alas, the game experience is killed by lack of elegance. The "Kicked-Out" actions means that there is no smoothgameflow. Players are constantly taking actions, or spending time CONSIDERING taking actions, out of turn. There are also too many markers/tiles/cards to constantly track and too many fiddly rules to make this worth the time and effort for me to play, unfortunately. 

 If it flowed more smoothly and was a bit more streamlined, it would be an easy sell. As is, I won't be playing this again.

Third Play(7-5-17 rated a 9)This has gone up to a masterpiece.  I don't know why it rubbed me the wrong way at first.  There is a lot of inter connectivity but the heart of the game is intuitive.  Really loving the endurance and quality of these Vital-EGG productions.  Looking forward to Lisboa!

Second Play(1-5-17 rated an 8)The fun factor involved in managing useful bonuses, meeples, artists, and the international market has gone up.  Managing influence and kicked-out actions was more rewarding too.


First Play(7-3-16 rated a 7)Seems like the only(best) winning strategy is to hold on to your original artists until they are celebs.  First several rounds seemed scripted.  Most of your moves seems obvious.  Final bonus seems tacked on.  Fun factor/complexity is a low ratio.  Beautiful production.  Looks nice on the table.

It's a heavy euro that's especially beautiful. It's pretty thematic and quite long and even though there's a lot to think about the turn structure is rather simple. It's slow to get going and it's hard to understand why you're doing some things until you have played through the game. I like the kicked out actions and managing the influence track and everything just works. However it doesn't really excite me. If I'm going to spend the mental energy and time to play a game like this, I think there are better options out there, for example Lacerda's own CO2. I think it has to do with the fact that money is the victory points. It means that you're just throwing around points most of the game and it never really feels like you're making progress.

The are so many things I like in this game, not so many actions to choose from but lot of things to do, interaction with your assistants and the kick off actions (when you leave an action you can left there an assistant to work for you when other player comes), the beautiful the game looks in the table, the different ways to obtain victory points and how everything flows in the game (so many things to explain at the beginning, but all clicks after one turn with many sense between actions)

When I'm not playing, I'm thinking about playing. Is it the most elegant game in the world? No. But the good kind of frustration you feel playing this game is why we play games.

After five years of gaming, we took a look at our collection and realized we had sold or traded off most of our really heavy games, and wanted something to replace them. The Gallerist filled a hole in this regard. 

We're not always in the mood for it, and the two-player experience can feel a little like playing ping-pong, but, unlike Vinhos, the rules have melted away, and now we're in that sweet spot where we're just exploring the gamespace. Rating will change based on whether that rigidly defined  space opens up further, or recedes.

Good to very good game, with many things to consider and look out for. You will pretty much be overwhelmed within your first game, but the board is not as crowded and painful to watch at, as "Kanban" from the same designer.

The only downside I found, has been the downtime. Since there's so much to do and to plan ahead, people need their time. The problem comes when everyone gets their "kickout action", as that may take some time. This is nothing really big, but there is some downtime.

Now, the only reason that keeps me away from buying it is, that you need to play it more often and probably with the same group, as you won't keep all these rules otherwise. I can't see this being pulled out with new gamers all the time and my groups rarely consist of the same people.

Lighter than Kanban, Vinhos, etc... Medium weight.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: tipus Lacerda, jo no el veig "lighter" en absolut. Les mecàniques semblen massa enrevesades i amb poca relació amb el tema (ho veig millor en el Kanban o el Vinhos). No es guanya per PV, si no per diners. De moment passaré, esperaré a veure quines crítiques té en un futur.

Had the Kickstarter edition.  Very nice production and beautiful game.  The box weights about 9 pounds!

Sold it because I needed the money and it did not look like I was going to get to play it soon.  Lately my only gaming partner is my wife and we are into story-driven games at the moment.

I liked this far more than Kanban which was an incomprehensible mess to me.  I thought there were a few innovative mechanics that were fun, but that overall it still was just not that enjoyable.  I struggle with getting the flow of Vital's games.  I always feel two steps behind, but in an annoying way as opposed to the exquisite tension of Agricola.

Woaahhh!! This is a beast. The rules explanation was around 2,5 hour which is acceptable for a game with complexity of 4,26/5. Firstly I didn't understand the whole thing, but around early-midgame the puzzle has been solved. It was like a cartoon where the light bulb lighten up from one second to another. After that i understood everything im doing which felt like self satisfaction. The playtime was around 2,5 hour and i quite enjoyed the whole thing. I feel that the theme is strong here as you are buying some kind of arts and try to make them worth more. The mechanic is one of the most elegant design of all time as all of the actions come from the theme. It feels like the game is telling me a story by playing it. This game can be calculated really well and for a guy who is learning mathematics it is a piece of joy. I believe as a long term investment this can be a great price / value game however unfortunatelly i have to admit that it has a super expensive price tag. On the other hand im not surprised by the price because the box containts a ton of things in it.

Pros / Cons:
-This is a very well thought out game which is a piece of joy for a guy who learns mathematics.
-I feel that the theme is really strong in this one.
-Can be a really great price / value game as a long term investment like years.

-The complexity might turn a few players of. You need addicted players to learn and play such a long one.
-Very expensive price tag.

The game works fine - but it is too complex for what it realizes. Never had the impression to play or to manage a gallery. It was working and optimizing - not playing. Good material mixed with small cubes representing visitors.

It's ok. The no repeat action rule means it follows like a rondel by proxy.

I think the key is to get 3 artworks ASAP and then progress them. So long as you have a full gallery you will rack up points quickly.

RATING: 8.5
Simplest deepest toughest game we own.  So many pretty pieces and art.  So simple - only 4 spots.  But wow its deep.  I also like the way worker placement is done here. I've always found most worker placement where only 1 person can take an action irritating.  This way anyone can take an action but there's a consequence.  Really love it.  

I almost wish there was another round as it always seems over so fast.  Better its not longer though because the decisions are so difficult we both had incredible AP.  Most strategically dense game I've ever played.

But WOW setup is brutal - by the fifth game it was a bit shorter but so many pieces.

This is my favourite game. It can be overwhelming when you first play it because there is so much you can do, however I Always tell people when I explain the rules: 'There are ONLY 4 places to go, with 2 actions each so there are only 8 actions'. And when they know that it becomes a lot more manageable. This game offers me everything I look for in a good euro-style-boardgame. Tough decisions, a nice theme, minimal downtime, interesting choices and challenging gameplay. Lacerda is a hero :D

RATING: N/A
Too many rules to ingest before a first play. It starts to make a little more sense halfway through, but this game would benefit quite strongly from having the core of the game be the base game and a lot of the other mechanisms be expansion modules. 

I don't like the extra actions thing for getting bumped from your spot. It feels rather disruptive to the flow of the game here. I'm not sure why that is, since following in Glory to Rome is kind of similarly disruptive, but it isn't to the detriment of the game. 

I do like the idea of buying a painting and trying to bump its value up. A game where that is the main focus would be neat. 

I enjoyed it pretty well once I got things figured out, but I still prefer the purer feel of the classic Euros. Overall something I probably wouldn't play again unless I felt comfortable enough to do so without having to refresh on the rules (which, given my memory, is unlikely unless played again very soon).

The game's lovely yet sterile board illustrations fit its overall attitude of respect toward art with the cynical acknowledgement that it's a modern commodity. You're not playing as an art-lover, you're playing as a businessperson.

I find the choices interesting but some of the mechanics a bit too abstract. The "kicked out" actions are the biggest example... it doesn't seem to be representative of anything so much as feel like a late addition to repair balance issues. But then you have the charmingly thematic option to leave an intern behind in your place to make use of it. So it sort of balances out?

Score is based on playing with two players; I expect it's better with more. And I can't talk about this game without mentioning that it has possibly the best designed box and insert I've ever seen.

A beautiful, lumbering beast of a Euro set around an interest worker placement/action drafting mechanic. A dozen moving pieces exert their influence over the direction of the game, all of which are available and beneficial but it's up to the player to parse which ones are the best. As a result it's a tired exercise that demands too much time for a casual event, but isn't exciting enough for a heavier game.

Beautiful game with a beautiful production. Vital is one of my favourite designers and I think his games deserves the deluxe treatment from EGG. As usual, Vital's games are highly thematic and this is no exception. In the Gallerist, you're an art gallery manager that does all the work of discovering and commissioning art, while promoting it to potential buyers for some cash rewards. Just a top game.

The Gallerist is a very smart game.  Using influence as a resource is really clever mechanism.  The production values and components are superb.  Some in-game actions (such as promoting artists and the international market) feel a little clunky in what otherwise is a very smooth game.  Really enjoying this one.

RATING: 8.5
Really solid euro that falls right into my wheelhouse. There are a lot of actions that do multiple things or allow you to take bonuses. The international market is definitely my favorite aspect as it has this in spades.

The central mechanic was pretty nice too. The bump out actions are a cool idea and knowing when you should take a weaker action or adjust your plan a bit to either go where you know your opponents want to go next or not go where they already are adds some more to think about. And the way artists have two works available at any given time means that you can work together with one other player to push that artist's fame up and thus potentially make more money when selling.

Overall the game reminded me a bit of just a lighter version of Kanban, but I think there were more opportunities to take actions that got you bonuses, which I always enjoy.

I'd say the biggest downside for me is that because of the production values the publisher feels justified charging a premium for the game. Personally I'd much rather it have standard production values and also be priced at the standard for this kind of game. Though apparently the publisher has its market.

The art and the production quality are great, the game just looks amazing. The mechanics mostly make sense together (discover artist, buy and sell art, promote an artist to increase their fame and thus art value etc), there are some mechanics which are standard fare (recruiting assistants to take extra actions etc), but there are also mechanics that have nothing to do with the theme which are just there to increase the complexity and difficulty of decisions.

While I prefer my games to be a little more elegant than this, I can definitely see that there may be a very good game here but it will need several more plays to find out.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (March 2016)

Vital Lacerda is one of my favorite game designers, I have liked and bought every one of his games and The Gallerist isn’t the exception (I like it a lot), HOWEVER, I expected more from it. As it stands, I still prefer Vinhos and Kanban over this one.

The rules aren’t very hard, just the opposite, the core rules are very simple, but there are many cascading/parallel/bonus options so the particulars go deep. You can probably explain it under 35 minutes, but once you begin playing, everything flows easily because The Gallerist makes a lot of thematic sense (a rarity in an eurogame). Playtime is around the 3 hour mark, the game can induce some AP to gamers prone to it, so perhaps it is best with 3 players.

The game comes in a BIG box. I’m  not sure how I feel about this, but I think I like it. In any case it is a minor issue for me. The game components are very well done, the production values are through the roof, the components are amazing and there are a ton of them. The tiles are thick cardboard that feel very good. The art is also good, but I would have liked to have actual people that depict the artists instead of silhouettes. I think the game features real art submitted by real artist but I’m not 100% sure this is right. The graphic design is outstanding. It is an expensive game, but I don’t care much about that.

I’m neutral toward the theme, I don’t like it nor dislike it, but the game IS thematic, the game mechanisms support the theme and many actions “feel” thematic.

The Gallerist is a medium weight worker placement game, with bits of bidding and area control as well. Unlike most worker placement games, players do not block the space they use in their turn and they can be “kicked out”, this triggers some bonus actions.

The Gallerist features very interesting and non-obvious decisions (which action to take, which executive action to take, how to move the meeples, what kind of meeple to move, how to use my limited influece), timing is very important (as is usual from Vital´s games) and they are all interconnected. Every decision matters. The game´s end works similar to Kanban´s.

The luck factor is low in general, perhaps, there is some luck with the contract cards, but as you can see eight of them in the same turn, I feel it is very controllable. The Gallerist is a game of skill, not luck.

Manipulating visitors is exciting and the only way to attack directly your opponents, other than that, there is not a lot of player interaction, (which is fine for me).

Bottom line, I expected more from it, but I think The Gallerist is a good game. Perhaps with more plays it will fulfill my expectations. It is also lighter than expected. I want to play it again soon as I have only played it twice and I need more plays to gauge it better. Perhaps it is overproduced, but I really like the components.

RATING: 9
An excellent game with incredibly tough choices at every turn. I love the way the design asks you to do actions at the expense of the very thing that would provide you the most benefit from doing those actions. For example, I really want to sell some art to an investor and then use an executive action to gain more money -- I have to discard an investor from my gallery to sell the art, which makes the executive action less effective.

Choices like this make for an excellent game, not to mention the great use of the "kicked out actions." I would gladly play this one again!

The game plays great with 2, 3, or 4, and the solo game even does a decent job of capturing the feel of the multiplayer game. This game is definitely a top 10 game for a while (top 5 currently) since I love how thoughtfully and carefully you have to play in order to take full advantage of being kicked out (not to mention avoiding helping the other players as much as you can).

Good, but too much for what it is. The artist renown mechanic is brilliant, but underused and doesn't carry the rest of the game, which can be tedious; there are too many symbols and abilities to activate, and many of them feel redundant or boring. It is also too solitaire for me - as far as theme and interaction, this is the kind of game I'd like to be able to play with my mother, but it's just too complex for her, and not interesting enough for my game group.

I am not a fan of Lacerda's games because I find them overcomplicated and too abstract, but the feelings on the Gallerist have been good. There are only four well-related actions, they work altogether as a clock, and the retrieval actions and influence adds a new flavour in the very repetitive world of worker placement games, in addition to minimizing the downtime.

The set up probably is too long and the box and components too large.

RATING: 8
Good, solid game from Vital Lacerda.  Probably doesn't get played as often as it should because of steep learning curve and longer game length.  But, a game of great depth with interlocking mechanisms, I particularly enjoy the aspect of the game that sees the various Artists' fame increase as more of their works get bought and promoted.

There is a good game in here but its just too cluttered.  'Kick out' actions muddle the flow of the game and generate downtime.  Too many requirements to do actions - you will work out your move then try to execute it and find you cannot.  Complexity masquerading as depth.  Still, I actually liked the core of the game and the theme works.

[floatleft][ImageID=2503200][/floatleft]Like 2014's [thing=109276]Kanban[/thing] The Gallerist is a medium-heavy Euro game with a fairly long rules explanation, but which flows extremely well once you get the hang of it. Kanban is my favorite game from last year so I was expecting great things here and I wasn't disappointed. 

The Gallerist offers many interlocking systems for the player to manage, and has a fairly open ended strategy space. There are several ways to earn VPs and you can dabble in all of them or focus on a few, but the key to doing well is to keep an eye on your opponents and try to leverage their desires and actions to your own benefit. The game features two prominent positive player interactions. The first is that players can both own art from the same artist, and therefore have a shared interest in seeing that artist gain fame which will increase the value of her works of art. The second is that on your turn you move your pawn to one of the four locations on the board, if there is an opponent's pawn there you kick them out and perform your action, but when you're done that opponent can perform a kicked-out action. A kicked-out action can be a small (and relatively meaningless) executive action, or the kicked-out player can spend some hard-won influence to do a full action at that location. It is hard to avoid kicking someone out, but who you choose can be important, getting to do an extra location action before your next turn can be hugely important. Getting kicked out can be very good even if you don't get to do an action, because if you start your turn at a location you must move to a different location. If you get kicked out you can go wherever you like. Each location has two actions and you often want to do them back-to-back so getting kicked out can allow you to sequence your actions efficiently. 

[center][ImageID=2726926 medium][/center]

The players can influence the pacing of the game. There are three endgame conditions, if two are met the game will end after the active player's turn. This adds a lot of depth to the game because it forces you to evaluate your decisions in the context of a variable game length.

This is the game I'm the most excited to play more because I think it's the game I have the most to learn about. After two games I'm still unsure of my strategic options, let alone how to execute well on a particular plan. This is perhaps also a warning for some. The Gallerist will challenge you! It's a game where you stare at the board for the first few turns wondering what exactly you're supposed to do. Individual actions and options are easy to understand, but how to use them to efficiently amass VPs is not clear at all. For me this is a wonderful feeling, and I look forward to figuring this game out.

The Gallerist stands out from the masses of boardgames with its mature design which is appropriate given its theme. Less outstanding as it can be expected by now from Vital Lacerda, it's a heavy and convoluted Euro. Lacerda is trying hard to put the theme into the center of its mechanisms. Nonetheless, The Gallerist essentially remains a mechanical construct with the challenge consisting in the mastery of complexity.

An action selection mechanism forms the center of the game. With only four action spots I wouldn't call it worker placement. Each of the spots allows one of two actions. Furthermore, a player can take one executive action each turn which either is placing an assistant on a contract spot or moving potential buyers on the board. An additional replacement action can be taken when somebody claims the selected spot and the displaced player spends influence to execute this action out of the turn order.

Gameplay is demanding and AP-inducing. Getting money and influence can be achieved various ways. Setting up more efficient ways to achieve these, keeping the secret game end conditions in mind when purchasing, using tactical opportunities and avail oneself of the replacement actions by having the required influence on hand at all times is a versatile challenge.

The Gallerist needs considerable upfront investment. My initial play was entertaining. My concern is if the complex system continues to entertain with variety and depth once the width generating the complexity is understood. Except for the luscious production, I don't see much differentiation specifically toward the earlier Lacerda titles or the ones of his Portuguese comrades (Kanban, Madeira, Vinhos).

Note: The game is complex and sophisticated. I am personally not there yet to enjoy such a complex game, but I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys playing these kinds of games. The game is well-made and fun but has lots to consider and plan. It is definitely a great game (but just not for me, sadly).

Up there with FCM as the heaviest games I own. This game is super complex and has a ton of interlocking systems that need to be managed, but once you get used to it, everything melds together so well. It's complex, but the complexity is there for a reason and doesn't just feel bolted on.

I enjoyed this game a lot.  It was very thematically coherent, and what to do just made sense.  It's a very meaty game, but not detrimental to the enjoyment.

My only regret is that I know it just won't hit the table as often as I like.

RATING: 8
The Gallerist is right at my complexity limit. Other complex euros (like Madeira) made me realize that I had an upper limit on how many rules I can digest. The two plays I've had so far have been with an expert player that I continuously pepper with rules questions throughout.

But I really like the artwork here, it is a definite draw and the graphic design really aids my enjoyment. The game itself is very challenging, it feels like a struggle to do what you need to do. I won't deny that it feels like he just added element upon element until it didn't make sense to add any more, but I'm enjoying the challenge.

I probably have to give this one another shot as I was just getting into deeper euros when I played this and I found it a little too much to grapple with. Still, when I've played Lacerda games since then they tend to feel just a little clunky despite their cleverness. He's a designer I respect for his ideas but who, for one reason or another, just doesn't seem to align with what I find to be "fun."

I have played this four times--once solo and three times 2-player. It functions really well at 2-players. Trying to find a reasonably efficient path to buying, promoting, contracting, and selling without giving your opponent a way to hop on board and benefit from your artist's success is difficult and fun. Juggling those aspects while managing the international market is what pushes this game up to a 10 for me.

Every time I've played this I had to take a Tylenol. There's a lot going on in this game but I don't think it blends well. A kicking out worker placement sounds more interactive but in reality it still is a multi-player solitaire point salad to the extreme. I do like heavy euros, Trickerion being one of them. This is the only Vital game I've tried but I do want to try his others, but a little hesitant if this game's mechanics are similar to his other games. Not to mention this game seems to end abrupt. Just when you getting your engine going of what to sell, who to promote, well it's game over and I get a feeling of having not accomplished much. Maybe I'm just terrible at playing this. You need a dedicated group for this one because teaching this game to new players ad nauseam is probably not the way you will want to play this.

Vital Lacerda's best game to date. The game is so elegant and streamlined. The kick out actions could have been more thematic, but everything else in here is so integrated with the theme, as per usual with the heavy theme master. I feel like a gallerist in this game, going around smoozing, finding new artists, using their creativity to further my influence and pocket, and exhibiting glorious works in my gallery. This game can play fairly quick too once you know it. Not nearly as heavy as some of his other games, and rules explanation isn't as segmented in explanation.

first of all this a rating [6] after one play with 4 players.
first impression : Very complex rules , much too complex for me ...
It's just over kill on decisions and there is sometimes too much downtime as in between your turns. 
Hope it's more like my personal distaste than a game problem so I'd like to try it again to see if my opinion changes.
For me KANBAN is much better because the theme is very well incorporated with the game and that feeling I didn't have with The Gallerist
2nd play :upgrade rating to 7 but 
downtime still too much
3the play: upgrade rating to 8

RATING: 7
FIRST IMPRESSION:

The production values are out the roof as Eagle tends to be. Game play is still a bit opaque with quite a few options and married mechanisms as is typical of Vital games. Will likely take several games to grok and is not easy to teach. Also, can be easy to put yourself out the game if one isn't careful managing the different currencies of the game. 

PLAYTEST IMPRESSION:

As the game is not yet fully developed, I won't rate the game.  There are some interesting concepts in the game but it still feels a bit rough around the edges and the amount of scoring that occurs becomes pretty crazy late in the game (crescending amounts!).  As my twin also noted, the game almost feels a bit like KanBan despite a very different theme  (it is different but there is a similar feel as to probably cycle of actions, various scoring mechanisms, and some massive end game scoring as well as scoring for chosen items.

This game is a victim of too many working parts.  The Gallerist has so many facets to it that they not only become overwhelming, but some are just unnecessary as well.  It's like the designer sat down and just kept adding and adding stuff to this game.  Another problem lies in the downtime between players.  With four players, the game took nearly three hours.  There's also the frustrating aspect of attempting to fill your gallery with artwork while never having enough money to do so.  Then you sell art to get money, but now you've opened more space on your gallery walls when you've been trying to fill them to achieve certain success tokens.  By the time it was over, I felt like I ran in place for the latter half of the game.

RATING: 5
The general flow of buying works of art from artists, publicizing those artists, to add value for their works in a pseudo-commodity speculation aspect, and then selling the art at a higher price is sound and the theme is really unique. However, it is the everything else I don't like. The bonus actions you get if someone goes to the spot you are at seems like a cool idea to create more interaction, but I didn't find those interaction decisions interesting and they messed with the otherwise simple game flow by having people take turns "out of order". The scoring tokens on the international scene don't make much thematic sense and just  feel like a vomit of scoring options. The attracting people to your gallery feels a little abstract, and I think they should have utilized something with them to score instead, as that would kill two birds with one stone. The influence track is a really mechanical and non-thematic influencing of trying to squeeze money/extra actions from it at the lowest cost.

Also minor disappointment, but I wish there were more use for the cool easels than for the most part just standing pretty off to the side for the whole game.

Vital Lacerda has yet another brilliant worker placement game.  Like Kanban there is a single worker that is being moved to various locations.  If you go to a location where another worker is that player can get another action.  You are trying to buy and sell art and improve the reputation of artists you own.  Art and components are very solid.  I am rather annoyed with myself that I did not buy this one on the Kickstarter. 

It is tilted toward the heavier end of the scale.  I really like Lacerda as a designer.

The Gallerist is a terrific example of a thematic euro and a great game to boot.  The actions are simple to grasp, yet the strategy is very difficult to master.  The influence track adds depth to every decision and you must take your opponents' moves into account when planning for future turns.  It comes with a solo mode that is smooth and easy to implement and makes learning new strategies between group plays fun.

Like many euros, it gives the sense that for each turn there is an optimal move, which can lead to AP in groups.  It's offset a bit by the art collector and dealer goals though, and the auction site provides further alternate paths to victory. A great game by a great designer.

This game is heavy, but so fun to play. The mechanisms link together seamlessly and, with a couple plays in the pocket, they start to make sense and strategy is made possible.

In my first play, I only started figuring out how to play when about 2/3 of the game was already gone. It left me with a desire to play more to master it. Too bad it was on the longer side and we couldn't at that time.

This is another great, great design by Vital Lacerda, and the artwork is beautiful.

This was my first Vital Lacerda game. I love it. I understand that it is probably the lightest of his games so far so I don't think I will chase down Vital's earlier games. I want to explore this some more. It plays solo as well which is great, but I can't carry another suitcase around with on my travels to fit it in! The box is even bigger than Francis Drake, and that's a big game!

Great depth and fantastic production. The game keeps you on your toes with everybody's turn as you are hoping for kicked out actions to maximise your play. There is just so much going on and it is all enjoyable. Bare in mind you will need to sit in a calm coloured room with your legs crossed listening to a solitary cymbol being gently brushed by a fourth generation Theravada Buddhist monk on a Nepalese mountain top for about an hour afterwards ... or alternatively my easier preference of a stiff drink to ease the mind ... or thinking about it maybe that's just me?!

Really looking forward to Lisboa Vital's next game as long as it is around the same weight, any heavier and I might just have to splash out for that ticket to Nepal.

Definate keeper. Couldn't afford the postage to trade it anyway!

So, after one play, I was unsurprisingly baffled by its complexity. The second play (which came about 12 hours later, was of course, much smoother and clear). That said, my enjoyment of the game was not enhanced the second time. In fact it might have slightly diminished, being that the first game left me in a cool state of wonderment. The second game, on the other hand, left me underwhelmed. 

There are some good points. The kick out mechanic is cool. The fact that there are only 4 primary action spaces is cool. I love being able to play a meaty game in less than 2 hours, and this one is close to 30 minutes per player (probably about 40 per during your first few plays). Something should also be said about how great the production is..this game is quite nice. The things I don't like: the feeling that the first few turns are largely scripted, the fact that the theme doesn't really come through that well, the art (particularly the box), and the samey feel. I say it feels "samey" because it feels awfully similar to Vinhos. That said, almost everything that Vinhos did right, The Gallerist did wrong. I see why people like it. I like it. I just don't like it enough to keep it, despite my admiration for the designer.

This game is really heavy. Doing a search for games with average weight between 4 and 5 with at least 100 user ratings, you'll get a list of fewer than 40 games, and The Gallerist is on that list. There's a lot going on in it. It's a deeply strategic game, and it's also immensely thematic. I enjoy it a lot, but have a hard time getting it to the table due to its complexity.

RATING: 7.5
My rating is provisional based on three plays, one with 2 one with 3 and one with 4.

It is an engaging and meaty game marred by a very clunky action taking mechanism.  It is a struggle to remember turn order.

How much this will impact my enjoyment of the game has to be determined.  My guess is that I'll get used to it over time and see only the beauty.  And there is a lot of beauty here.

In love with this game. Scoring is cleaner than other euros in similar vein. OOZING with theme and everything makes thematic sense. It feels like you can get a lot done in the game but it doesn't actually play that long. Decisions are tough but players are not devastated even if they have to take the 2nd best option. My favourite aspect: Definitely the lowest downtime I have experienced in the same weight of games. Kickout action is beautifully implemented.

RATING: 5
This game is overwrought and needs someone like Knizia to strip it down. Get rid of auctions and area control from the international market (just the 12 endgame bonus tiles will do). Eliminate or clean up kicked out actions so they don't totally disrupt the flow of the game. Just because a game has a weight over 4 doesn't mean the gameplay is any deeper than a 2.5 that has simple rules and gets the fuck out of the way so that players can compete. If I had any balls, I'd rate this lower.

Eh, screw it, my genuine rating is a 5. The designer is likely a genius, but needs to reign in his madness.

Das Spiel selbst hat mir sehr gut gefallen. Viele schöne kleine, schlichte Mechanismen die aber auch thematisch sehr schön ineinander greifen und ein sehr angenehmes und stimmiges Spielgefühl erzeugen.

Der Einstieg viel nicht ganz leicht, da die Regeln doch recht umfangreich sind. Die Symbolik war für mich ein wenig gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber an sich schon in Ordnung und verständlich. Spätestens beim Auspacken der kleinen Holzstaffelein merkt man deutlich, dass es sich hier um recht erfolgreiches Kick-Starter Projekt handelt. Das gesamte Material ist sehr hochwertig und detailliert designed.

Die Zeitangabe auf der Schachtel erscheint nach der ersten Partie sportlich. Aber dadurch, dass man auch auch mal außerhalb der normalen Zugreihenfolge, durch das Verdrängen bzw. verdrängt werden, wieder an die Reihe kommt, verkürzt zumindest die gefühlte Downtime erheblich.

Huge box!  Looks nice.  Wow, there is a lot going on here.  Maybe the ultimate 'need to do four things but only can do one' game.  Most of it makes sense, but some rules, like a viewer leaves the gallery after a sale, are easily forgotten and mess up your plans when enacted.  Thr player aides are exceptionally good so once you get started they are mostly all you will need.  The 'kick out' actions an interesting addition.  The tickets timing the game an odd one.  

Aug '17: played with two and worked pretty well!  Again, had to do a lot of learning how to play as it was not clear unril we started, then it went fine.  Hopefully, I play without a two year gap next time!

Interwoven mechanics, lots of space for strategy but without an overwhelming number of options.  Decisions are tense, especially as time runs out.  Excellent component design and quality.

Wow, I did not expect to get so much push-back from my GF on this game. I knew it was heavy going into it but she's usually a good sport. I think it's the fact that you have to figure out your own objectives in this game through acquiring tiles that turned her off. The starting objective cards weren't enough direction. We're going to give it another go. Components are superb, though.

I wanted to love this game.  The art and theme is beautiful and unique and it should be a refreshing addition to an industry that sometimes feels stale (so many train games!)

But this game is broken.  It's long, there are too many pieces, it's overcomplicated with no good reason.  I gave it a second chance but both times I just wanted it to end, it was repetitive and even torturous trying to manage your gallery with no sense of balance or reward to your actions.  Such a shame because I wonder how many people will be put off from board games in general if this became their gateway game.

The main board is very cool, it has a Main Square where the different kind of Visitors gather and then each player has his Gallery where they want to attract the Visitors.

Each Gallery has 2 different spaces, the Lobby where the Visitors arrive and the Gallery itself where the Visitors can see the art...

Having visitors in the Lobby allows you to get benefits from some actions while having them in the Lobby allows you to have access to other markets...

The problem is that Visitors in your lobby can be taken away from your Rival Gallerists!

The way the Artists are discovered, the way we buy, exhibit and sell the artworks all makes sense, has it's always the case with games by Vital Lacerda...

We can also do marketing actions to promote the artist fame and reputation making their works more expensive for the players to get and more valuable when you sell them...

There's also a mechanic of area control and bidding, it's not bidding like in an auction game but rather you pay certain amounts of money to get into a specific space on the Foreign Market so you can be one of the Gallerist to get one of the Artworks in display at the end of the game, and there aren't enough for all players, so the one that spends the less leaves without a work for the Gallery.

Despite being able to not get one of those final artworks all the biding players do get them some bonus or end game goals to score... they also provide numbers for the area control in each of the 3 sections on that part of the board, and there are quite some points to be gained... but that requires that the players have some assistants to send there (and the 2 you start with aren't enough, you'll have to get more) and required specific combinations of visitors in your Lobby...

One of the more interesting mechanics in the game is that no player is ever blocked out of a space like in most worker placement games... you can get to any place you want but you'll be bumping the player that was already there and that means that the bumped player will have the option of doing an Executive Action at the end of the current player turn... so when you bump someone you are giving them the chance to do some extra actions (provided they can do them)

The game is AWESOME!!! I'm starting to think that Vital only knows how to do great games...

It's lighter than his previous games, it's probably the lighter one but that doesn't mean it's light! It isn't!!! There are a lot of things to account for...

Great production value. Bland artwork.

NOT a complex game just an unpolished mix of mechanics that work against game play. 

Pay money to get money - spend influence to get influence - five, unnecessary, steps to perform one simple action - out of turn actions that just add chaos and downtime - sneeze and get a bonus (are they all the same?) -  cough and gain points -

Provisional rating. I found this a lot less elegant than Kanban from a first play-through, with some fiddly and annoying rules. But it's still rather pleasing discovering artists, herding people into your gallery, and then selling works for a tidy profit--so I'm hoping the game's fiddliness will start to seem less obtrusive after greater familiarity.

This is a wonderful heavy high quality euro about a very unique theme. Breaking it down to the basics it is just a worker placement game with 4 spots. But tough decisions and heavy resource management makes the game a complex one. Plays great with two and always a delight to play. One big negative : the setup and cleaning up takes almost 10 minutes each, allowing the game to be played on weekends for us

Very smooth game with plenty of interlinking action spaces and an inventive knock on action when you get knocked out from an action space. You can always get the action space you want but if someone else is there you give them an extra action.
The theme whilst not overly deep works well and if you don't try to memorise all the actions and just refer to the player aids the game moves along reasonably swiftly.
I think the sweet spot is either 2 or 3 players as with 4 there is going to be too much downtime for my taste particularly with knock on actions.
Overall a tremendous game and one that feels much smoother than Kanban (which I also like a lot).
After playing a 4 player game I think that the knock actions happen so frequently that the downtime is a real issue. I don't think I want to play with 4 again.

RATING: 8.7
Quite similar to Kanban but in very many ways extremely different. I disagree with other opinions that this is lighter than Kanban. For me the amount of open information actually is a bit overwhelming to the point of leaving the player in paralytic shock due to over analysis. 

But if you play off the cuff like I usually do then the game is enjoyable and amazing combos and chain reactions can be played. The kicked out mechanism is definitely the key to setting up some interesting moves for yourself.

Gorgeous and brilliantly thinky Euro. One of my favourites. If it has a weakness is that the lovely theme and joy of running an art gallery might get lost among the number crunching.

I think I'm finally done with Vital Lacerda's games. It's too bad, because he does have some interesting mechanisms that do a good job of capturing the theme. His games are just too damn fiddly. This was one of his cleaner designs, but it still needs a lot more streamlining to be enjoyable for me. I still think Vinhos is Lacerda's best game. It can be fiddly as well, but the way actions are selected is silky smooth, IMO.

RATING: 7
There is a lot to like in The Gallerist. With only eight actions to choose between each turn, you must balance carefully to make your gallery successful both financially and artistically. Should you discover new and still cheap artists or promote established artists and make them more expensive? Should you invest in art for long term profit or sell to raise money? Should you hire assistants to get more actions or attract visitors to make your actions more valuable? If those had been all the mechanisms, the Gallerist could have been a clean and elegant design. Instead, I feel that too many small point opportunities make the game more tactical than strategical and the feeling of playing a real gallerist is lost.

A beast of a game from, who else?, Vital Lacerda. The component quality is exceptional with big, thick cardboard that shows how much they looked after it. As for the gameplay, is a very sweet brain burner where every action gives you a bonus that will give you a side bonus and so on. The mechanism with the kick out actions is elegant and incourages strategic thinking and careful planning. A little long especially if you have AP prone players but it doesn't gets boring because almost always it keeps you involved with the kickout actions. Many paths to victory to search. One of my favorites!

Strong meaty simulation, with a tight elegant action selection combined with a large variety of intertwined cogwheels of effects triggered by those actions. There are really tough and important choices to be made here, even in the solitaire game. There is a true freedom to strategize (the player is not spoon-fed or funnelled into a default strategy). A subtle difference in making a small decision can have major consequences down the line (everything affects everything emergently). Hence every triumph feels truly earned. Components (even player aids and player boards) are ridiculously thick cardboard. Everything is beautiful and overproduced, and the insert is truly made by a board gamer for a board gamer (nothing spills or moves around). The first game is hard to get through, if none of the players has played before, due to the strategic complexity.

Vital makes, again, a great and deeply strategic game. The theme is rare and EG makes it a beauty (with the possible exception of that ugly pink bunny). The rules are quite complicated, but, overall, they make enough sense so you can memorise them all quite easily. Also, it probably carries one of the best written manuals of all board game history (from the perspective of a complete newbie like me).

RATING: 5.1
This games relies far too much on the fact that there are only 8 primary actions and it overloads those actions with secondary and tertiary further actions.

The action selection of the game is convoluted because of it, where you often have to take sub-optimal actions because you lack a ticket or money. But getting a ticket or money is not accessible through anything but secondary actions, so trying to workout how you get those is where the "heaviness" of this game comes from., not from any interesting decisions.

RATING: 8
I'm slightly concerned that The Gallerist is "solvable", but it's no more or less "solvable" than any other pick-up-and-deliver games.  And oh, yes -- The Gallerist is most definitely a pick-up-and-deliver game.  Pick up artists and deliver their goods to buyers.  Pick up fans and deliver the artist's reputation(s).

Until you drop the apparent Euro lenses, you will smash your head against the cool, reserved edges of this masterpiece.  It's so rich in theme that it deceives you into thinking it's something other than what it is.  Keep your eyes on the prize, though, and you're gold.

Gioco dai materiali gradevoli per grafica e idee. Anche i dettagli come la scatola e i suoi contenitori sono curati con attenzione. Il gioco è un tipico 'Lacerda', ovvero ricco di alternative strategiche e di meccaniche varie amalgamate tra loro, anche se in sintesi si tratta di un piazzamento lavoratori. Interessante la soluzione dell'azione bonus quando si viene scalzati che effettivamente riduce i tempi morti tra una fase attiva e l'altra. L'ambientazione trovo che per molti versi si senta anche grazie alla componentistica. Come meccaniche il gioco risulta meno complesso del previsto anche se le prime partite risulteranno di ambientazione soprattutto per la comprensione dei punti a pioggia che a fine partita arriveranno. Nel complesso un gioco che mi ha colpito positivamente anche se il prezzo rimane importante.

RATING: 9
The Gallerist is a fantastic, beautiful and elegantly designed worker placement/economic simulation with stunning artwork and great components. I was a little familiar with Lacerda's games from Co2 and noticed a similarity in the games he's designed. Lacerda is devoted to taking on non-traditional, unique themes (maybe a little dry) and developing a faithful and engaging game around it. As for The Gallerist, experienced gamers may spot elements from other games like the displacement mechanic from Hansa Teutonica which grants players bonus turns and extra resources if an opponent "kicks" them out of a particular spot. Or the flexible "influence track" from Troyes which can be turned into the other currencies of The Gallerist: money or fame. But, at its core, the game is a simple worker placement of four basic action spaces, branching out to eight total. Having played the game a couple of times with friends, winning strategies may be crafted around knowing exactly when to use your influence to grant yourself an extra action or just taking a simple bonus action. The scores were close enough in the end that I immediately wanted to play it right away again. My only critique is that there are a lot of icons and hieroglyphs which are overwhelming for the first time but they all make sense after the second round or so. (I've learned recently that this is by design: Vital makes a concerted effort to have little to no text in his games, making everything language-independent, therefore universal. There is something beautiful in that idea, as well). And no game about curating high art would be complete without its own masterpieces: the game board, components and design. Everything is top-notch in this game, from the sturdy cardboard to the high-quality card stock and the artwork that was exclusively designed for the game's exhibits of paintings, sculptures, photographs and 3D artwork. The Gallerist, I promise, is worth every cent in replayability and design. One of the designer's best games and one of the best games I've played this year.

This is my first Lacerda game and I'm certainly impressed. Running an art gallery isn't really my idea of a good game topic but this game is a really mind blowing experience! It just has so many layers and things to consider that it makes most Rosenberg games look like children's games. I've only played this once, so I will wait before I give it a rating but I definitely want to keep playing this one!

One complaint - you have pink and brown meeples that look identical to colorblind people like myself. I had a friend mark each brown meeple with a dot so I could distinguish them but even my friend (who has good color perception) needed bright light to tell which was which. Clearer distinctions between these two groups of meeples would've been appreciated.

RATING: 1
Just balancing out the 10's because I'm a real boon to BGG society. But it's okay because I "payed" my dues. Seriously, folks, I never played the game, so I rate on high price, lack of stock, and mostly for having the extreme misfortune of participating in the Gallerist forums and meeting certain users. So, it's more a review of the BGG user base for the game, something that should have its own rating system. Update march 2016....game actually went up in price from $72 to $100. Can buy actual art for this price. I have played Vinhos and Kanban and found both overly complex, too long and boring.  I read the rules to The gallerist and it is the same.  Really do not understand the hype about this designer. He needs an editor.  His games do not deserve thick tiles and over production wth huge boxes.  The ‘air of superiority’ behind his releases is truly sickening. 

Ps - lacerda actually emailed me about this rating, whining "You didn't even play it. Why are you disrespecting me?" This is very poor form from a designer, harassing customers over a rating that was very clearly explained. I bought his games in the past and he hassles me? This shit needs to end. I even corrected his English and he got pissed about that, too. Will never support him or EGG again. Listen, Lacerda, if you don't want '1', stop redoing all your games, upping the price from $40 to $175, and making the games worse in the process. Very bad habit that NO ONE else does.  If you continue to sign contracts with EGG that price everything at $150 +, it's your own fault your ratings suffer. Suck it up.

If you're waiting for a Vital Lacerda game that isn't convoluted, unfortunately The Gallerist isn't it. It has a clever worker placement mechanism where if someone takes an action spot that you're on, you can pay influence to do that action again. I think the whole thing was just too much, though--each action spot was associated with two actions, each of which had a laundry list of steps that you needed to run through. And that doesn't even count the executive (read: extra) actions that you could take before or after your turn. It just takes a long time to get anything done in the game, and there are so many options that AP can definitely be an issue.

One of the better Vital games. Still a lot to wrap your head around, but I don't think any part of this game stood out. I'd definitely play it again, but I really wish a cheaper version of this game had come out. The components are top notch, but why?

It's probably in contention for my top spot of either Vinhos or this.

RATING: 7
Of course you can't deny this game is very good: the complexity is well thought through, ,with different possible strategies, the various mechanics match the theme very well, and the production quality is very high.

Although I don't dislike heavy games and I do like the theme of this game, I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to. Detailed planning is very important, something like: "I have to get this, go there, do that, to eventually take that action". So very prone to analysis paralysis. But the rewards you get for all this thinking are not very spectacular, you just do well at running your gallery.

I would prefer a heavy game like Food Chain Magnate (an equally complex game) where the focus is more on anticipating the other players' moves and the outcome of a well-executed plan is way more satisfying.

The design of the board, the components and the boxart is just great. The mechanic is streamlined and elegant. The interaction is integrated in the mechanics. The theme is unique. And so on....

The game itself is a masterpiece! After just one play it might be too early to say that but it has incredible depth for the play time (just 2.5-3 hours with 4 players) and theme integration is very well done. Of course there are some systems that are less connected to the theme but most of the part the theme shines through and it really feels like you are managing a gallery and buying, promoting and selling artworks. The artworks themselves are very nice also (contributions from real artists). Seems that the variable setup will give a lot of replay value.

1) The look is amazing. You have real art represented in the tiles. All the icons are simple to see.

2) Explanation is a bit long but simple enough. I always refer to the player aid coming with the game because you always forget something

3)Its a long game but I always hear, "Oh, it's my turn" because you only have 4 spot on the board and you can have a kick-out action (when someone takes your spot).

4) The quality is A1. Can't complain with it. A lot to place but its fun

5) I played solo or 4. I liked the solo play. The mecanism is really interesting. Achievement base. The 4 players is amazing. The board is really tigh

I would suggest for players starting going to heavier games. Another great Vital!!!

The flow is easier to see in this game, but I think - but only after 1 play - that there is a certain 'fixed' gameplay: 1) first acquire more workers as you can leave them and get benefits from the kick-off actions 2) work on your influence income (aka pink meeples) to make sure you can take the kick-off actions 3) Get some end point bonus tiles as they will boost your influence at the end of the game 4) Do some other stuff that will give you money

RATING: 5
I liked the concept of discovering artists and buying artworks - the tiles are beautiful! - to speculate with their value. 

But the rest of the game was dry as a bone and actually felt superfluous for the most part - particularly the whole assistant bit. The kick-out mechanism is annoying, disrupts the flow of the game and adds unnecessary length. Also, the game is praised as being highly thematic, but I don't get what putting meeples on a matrix for a majority end scoring or on contract cards just for the sake of getting bonuses has to do with the theme. Nor what the extra bonuses for raising the prestige of the artists mean - other than balancing what would otherwise been a weak option for placing your worker.

It's slightly better than Vinhos and the components are very nice (did I mention how beautiful the artwork tiles are?). But it still felt clunky in the integration of mechanisms, overcomplicated and too lengthy for what it is.   


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme is great for a heavy euro. As is typical of Lacerda, the rules are pretty heavy and complex. Even after learning all the rules deciding on what to do is still a challenge. I imagine enough plays and you can get there but definitely going to take several plays. Problem with that is just how often it's going to hit the table.
I'll update my rating after I get more plays in. In general I enjoy it but has limited playability. Not for newbie gamers!

A game I wanted to love. So many people were confused that I didn't like it like they do. For me the game seemed like a mess. I love love love the theme and that worked so well. I love the use of photography and art- it is right up my alley, really. The mechanics just seemed like a jumbled mess. I hate the kickout actions that can happen. For me there was no focus. I couldn't focus like I normally could. It just gave me a big headache. Unfortunately, this was not a game for me. I do see why people enjoy it. Just because I don't enjoy it doesn't mean you don't have to. Too heavy for me.

RATING: 7
This is a game where players play as art gallery moguls, who discover new artists, buy, sell and display paintings with the end goal of having the most money when two of three possible endgame timers trigger. The game has a lot of complex moving parts and things to remember, but it achieves having a meaningful choice to make every turn, and a feeling like I always need something I don't have yet. The action activation mechanism is interesting as well, as you can get extra actions when you predict your opponent's moves.

I'm in love with the theme, and I think of all Vital's designs, this one gets the semi-co-op concept just about right, with the ability to invest into artists that other players discovered. This also hits a nice spot for me with regard to being able to more or less define your own victory conditions. The places this game falls flat for me is there can be massive downtime between turns because of the order that people resolve their normal, then their kicked-out, then their aux actions. There's also a high barrier of rules entry compared to other, smoother stock market games like Mombasa. I'm happy to have played this game a few times, but so far, Vital's work just lacks a certain amount of elegance that I'm looking for in game designs that I keep around.

Vital Lacerda

New 2015 hit for Vital Lacerda.

Done many playtests and have to say the game improved a lot over the playtest period. Is a heavy eurogame (booth rules and strategy) with a great theme integration, just like the previous games from Vital. Played the game just a few days after Vital received the first print copy and the production value is outstanding.

I am sure the backers will be very pleased when they see what is inside the box (... and with the box, the art is amazing).

For me is a must have.

Vital's cleanest design yet. When compared to Kanban, this is certainly easier to teach and the strategy is a bit clearer. The theme of art dealing is quite a bit more enticing, as well. Gallerist also does a great job of revitalizing the popular worker placement/bumping mechanic you see in so many euros these days. managing those assistant meeples is key to a winning strategy. There is some small potential for player screwage with the visitor meeples and the auction board, but there's usually no need to go out of your way to do so. 

Overall, I think Kanban packs a bit more of a punch, but Gallerist is still an example of top-notch game design.

This game suffers from providing players with the trap of AP.  We played a 4 player game at a convention and there was enough time between turns for my wife to leave the convention area, go to the restroom and fill our water bottles....and that was just for 2 players to take their turn.

The mechanics are amazing.  The game IS fun.  The component quality is fantastic.  My ONLY complaint is the length of time between plays - I simply don't like just sitting there watching people think for 5 minutes.  Having said that, we were playing with 3 new players so I'm sure the AP problem could be mitigated by playing with experienced players.

I know this review sounds negative, but I want to emphasize that I think this game is amazing and is great for the right players.

Too early to score this. But after a solo play and one 2-player game, it seems excellent. A lovely, steady 'ecology' feel to it. There are a lot of little ways to undermine your opponent's opportunities and it will clearly reward multiple plays to get more out of the strategies.

It doesn't have that brutal blocking of spaces that you get in the designer's game Kanban (which I also love). Well, it's actually still there - just softer.

It has a nice friendly feel to it. The nuances are so extensive that you can be unaware of your inefficiencies, so you drift along to your loss happily enough!

The actions are too complex for what they do (many steps ; and then you can change inf to money / fame). Kick outs also mix the game in a bad way (they sound like a good idea, but I don't like them at the end). But what really grinds my gears is the end conditions. It could be that fulfilling them isn't anybodys intrest. So the game can drag on and on (and its already too long for what it is).

[u]The Positive:[/u]
(+) The slick look of the game with an unusual color palette matches the theme and gives a modern look and feel to the experience. It is one of the things which makes this game stand out.

(+) Quality of the components is unusually high: thick cardboard, artistic pawns, works of art with a reference in the rulebook, ...

(+) Dynamic end-game conditions. In our experience the three end-game triggers are rather balanced. When the game nears its end, there is a real excitement about how many actions every player has left. However, the game offers enough possibilities to players to make calculated assumptions and assess remaining possibilties.

(+) The gameplay offers players tons of opportunities to get different things done. In that way the game invites players to experiment with different mechanisms to achive the same goal, and those different approaches will give you different bonusses (or end game points) as you go.

(+) Interesting player interaction: 2 players can have intrests in the same artist. Will they both do their part to try to increase the fame of the artist and so increase the value of their works?

(+) Worker placement mechanism in which players don't occupy an action space: after their turn they can get kicked out by other players - but when they do, when they manage their stuff (assistents, tickets or influence) right, they can get precious bonus actions. This allows for some tactical moves (not to such an important extent as the action grid in Vinhos, but still relevant). Next to building up a greater strategic plan with bidding on the foreign market and trying to achive goals set by your curator and buyer cards, the game also offers tactical choices every turn.

(+) Manipulating visitors on the board is very important and very rewarding if you do it right. To me personally this is the most important thematic aspect of the game: do you try to fill your gallery with investors, then you will gradually see the game giving you plenty of opportunities to become rich. Do you invite VIP's, then you feel like pink 'Britney Spearses' are strolling through your gallery and you will notice the game rewarding you with more influence. Having collectors in your gallery is lots of fun, because they provide you with some more money and some influence, but what's also very important: they will immediately increase the fame of artists you are interested in! The rule which links the amount of collectors you can invite into your gallery to the amount of works previously sold is delightfully thematic and gives a fantastic dynamic gameplay-wise as you need to balance of letting your investments ripe or going for a smaller quick profit by selling early and getting the opportunity to attract more collectors.

(+) Managing the influence track is really very interesting. Much more interesting than it sounds, believe me :)

[u]The Negative:[/u]
[i]First 3 minor 'practical' complaints:[/i]
(-) Please never again make rulebooks in this format: when folded open they are too 'big' and clumsy and they make a quick reference to a rule while playing a real pain.

(-) Many like it, I don't: in my opinion the box is too big, it gobbles up more space than necessary in our gaming closet in which space is a real issue.

(-) The price: this is an expensive game

[i]Then the gameplay-related ones:[/i]
(-) When it comes to attracting visitors to your gallery, the game breathes theme and actions and rewards given by the game concerning this aspect are very thematically grounded. However, in other aspects of the gameplay, the game feels less thematic than such a title should. The game is filled with all kind of little bonus tiles here and there which activate bonus spaces, which might lead to visitors leaving your lobby (???) which might ... Those little bonusses really detract you from the basic theme which should be discovering new talent, buying works of art and making your investments grow. I understand why all these elements are added to the game: they are the basis of offering the wealth of tactical choices the game offers to players - but I'm sure first time players will be overwhelmed by them in the first half of the game in such a way that they don't feel like they are building up their gallery, but rather feel like [i]'What am I doing if I put this tile over here, and move this pawn there and then I can spend my extra action doing this which allows me ...'[/i]. This can make a game which really holds the promise of a very thematic euro-experience rather abstract (up until players really familiarize themselves with all those little aspects so they can see through these little things and grasp the theme hidden behind them again).

(-) Tracking who owns works of what artists is important and is a little fiddly with the signature tokens.

(-) Minor luck of the draw elements when drawing contract cards. Maybe it would have been a good idea if the display row would display one extra card? However, this is also a minor complaint as normally you should be able to find an interesting card (be it for the matching art type or the bonus executive action).

(-) Players looking for intense 'in your face' player interaction will probably not find very much of that here (this could happen when drawing visitors out of each others lobby's before your opponent gets the chance to go to the foreign market - but this will probably not happen frequently). Personally, I don't mind this at all and I think the subtle player interaction and the possibilities to create synergies are actually a big plus for this game, but this kind of player interaction won't appeal to everyone.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
It must put quite some weight on Vital's shoulders: we have grown to expect mechanical masterpieces with ingeniously clever intertwined mechanisms in all his games. Does he deliver with 'The Gallerist'? Yes he does! I don't know where his inspiration keeps coming from, but again Vital Lacerda treats players on a boardgame adventure filled with new interesting choices in which every step you take could open up potential doors for new opportunities to follow. The richness of tactical choices on the path of your greater strategic goal is stellar. However, on the flip side I feel this came at the cost of losing some thematical grounding in these mechanisms, despite clear effort put into this game to thematically simulate running a big influential art business. In some important game elements and mechanisms, the theme shines through wonderfully, in others: the many little bonus tiles and actions could detract from the art-investor fun - but I expect this could improve with more experience with the game.

Players will probably wonder how this game relates to Lacerda's other titles Vinhos, CO2 and Kanban. To me, the game holds the middle between Vinhos and Kanban. It has Kanban's impenetrability in the huge amount of small but meaningful bonus aspects, to lesser extent the densly interwoven gameplay elements and to lesser extent the variable game length - but it certainly is more accessible compared to Kanban. It has some of the thematic flavor offered by Vinhos, but flows much more 'at ease' as players get many small actions compared to the very few 'big' actions players are offered in Vinhos. Despite Vinhos remarkable elegant complexity in game mechanisms, it succeeds in grabbing all players by the neck and dragging them down in its theme from the get go - this is something I don't see happening with first time players of 'The Gallerist', and that's why Vinhos will  remain my all time favorite. 

Despite its high price tag, I am very happy to own a copy of this nicely produced and clever game and despite its clumsy oversized box, taking up way more of the limited and hard fought for boardgame space than necessary - 'The Gallerist' sure conquered its place in our game collection as a keeper!

[u]Tips, should you be going in:[/u]
(*) Getting the right visitors in your gallery early will benefit you greatly. Spot some bonus tiles with meeples on them ;) Getting some collectors would be nice, but requires one (or two?) early sales.
(*) At first, tickets will be flying all over the place, but in the second half of the game it might become a little harder to aquire them.
(*) Use your influence wisely: there is no reason to hoard it painstakingly, but having too little during the game might limit your options harshly.
(*) Try to start the game off with a greater plan, based on your curator and buyer cards and possibly even the first bonus tile you aquire at the start of the game.

Lots of intertwined complex mechanisms here. What makes it special is how nicely it all melds with the art industry theme. Steep learning curve but once you get your head around it, it's a great game.

Wow, is this game spectacular. A true TITAN among board games. Stand-out theme, brilliantly executed. Gorgeous art and intuitive graphic design. Components are lavish and satisfying. Intricate yet robust mechanics, as expected from Vital.

Hell, even the INSERT blew me away! Yes! I am a normal person! A normal person that got excited by a board game insert!

Solo mode is one of the best you can ask for. I have no problem sitting down with this game for hours by myself. Only complaint is that I wish it weren't so big, because it scares people away who'd otherwise play it with me! 

I need to play this game more. I feel like I've barely even scratched the surface.

If you like economic engine building games, there are better games than this, where the different parts flow together in a synergistic whole that this never achieved. (Euphoria comes to mind as what this game aspired to be and failed miserably to achieve.).   The interaction in this game is limited to taking an action someone else did previously and bumping them to get another smaller free or larger paid action. If you play with four people, that means that there are a possible seven other turns between your turn and your next turn.  There is almost too much going on, and the mechanics are fairly punishing. Playing this game felt like WORK, not fun. Don't get me wrong, I love some complex games...just not this one.  I am forever grateful I got to play this before (not) purchasing.

I really enjoyed the first play even thought I taught poorly and made a few errors.

Played it correctly the second time and I liked it a tiny bit less. Only because it finished faster playing correctly. The first time I cycled a lot of art through my gallery. Playing by the real rules meant I was able to do less. need to wrap head around that and I will probably enjoy it more in future.

Felt really constrained but still finished with a decent score relative to the other players. Not sure what to make of it.

Lots to like, but some things are starting to bother me.

I will play with you, but I'm not looking forward to it.

This worker placement game features Vital Lacerda's typical structure of complex, interconnected systems which interact with each other, and which the player interfaces with using only a few (4 slots, 2 possible actions on each) different actions.  Playing well requires a good deal of thought, and the choices are interesting throughout the game.  The art and components are fantastic.  Kanban introduced me to Lacerda, and this game reinforced my resolution to acquire all of his games.

My first Vital Lacerda game did not disappoint. I loved it. There were so many juicy decisions, so many satisfying moments as you set yourself up for that kicked out action that really maximizes your engine. The theme comes through greatly and the components are possibly the best I've seen. Everything about this game is fantastic.

This game is something...! Easy to understand, but when you first try to do your first action, you realise all the dept of the game. Your first game is pretty much a practice! I bought this for my wife who loved the theme, i was not too interested, but after playing it, the theme is just perfect, and during the play you reinforce the theme in each and every action you take. Be mindful, this is a HEAVY HEAVY euro... if you play with people with analysis, you'll kill them lol

Game play is elegant (place a single worker on your turn), thematic, and with lots of interlocking parts and end game goals. One can recognize quite a bit of cross-pollination of ideas from Vital's earlier games, which means that players who are fans of his earlier games will most likely like this one too.

The Gallerist sets a new standard for the quality of its components and the careful thought and craftsmanship that went into its production. The well-written and well-illustrated rule book is worth mentioning and makes learning this game a breeze. 

Another great game by my favorite designer.

This was my first Lacerda game and it did not disappoint.  Very meaty game with endless choices and strategies to take.  I love the theme as it is different than most games.  The worker placement is great in this game as each spot gives you two choices, but then you can leave behind an assistant and when someone else chooses that location, you can spend influence to use the location again. The key to the game is maximizing your influence and getting as many turns as possible throughout the game.  Love this one.

(one play) Superb heavy Euro that takes advantage of not really including anything new by being able to include a couple more "old" systems than any game ought to be able to handle safely and yet finding ways to make them shine.
Sure, there were an awful lot of exceptions in the rules, with systems working inconsistently in places, and some of the thematic chrome was a bit dodgy.
But it felt amazingly cohesive and there was a sense of multiple plausible routes to victory.
If I get the chance to play this some more, I suspect my rating will go up - sadly, I also suspect that I probably will not.

The Gallerist is a very good, complex game built around a simple action selection mechanism. The way the artwork works is reminiscent of stock games to some extent, and I don't generally like stock games, but here it doesn't bother me the way it usually does. The thing that really holds the Gallerist back for me is how the kickback actions prevent the game from running smoothly. If it ran as smoothly as Kanban, I suspect it would be one of my favorite games.

Vital Lacerda's games always attempt to do more with more.  What I mean by that is that his games are good, but they have a lot of rules which are used to add game play depth and complexity rather than having fewer rules which combine really well together to make a game deep and interesting.  Figuring out how all the moving parts work together is the hardest part of the game.  So yes, I like The Gallerist, but I feel like the game could have been streamlined a bit and still been just as good.

Also, I do have a major complaint about the game, the box is far too big and is highly inconvenient to store.  I purposefully limit the amount of space I dedicate to storing games and as The Gallerist takes up the space of 2 normal games I may eventually have to sell it as I don't think the game is good enough to justify dumping 2 other games to make space for it.

[2 plays] Four player learning game. Very complex eurogame nearly on the level of Die Macher. About 45 minutes of rules and then 4 hours to play. Everything about the theme works pretty well (well, I never really felt a meaningful difference in the types of visitors other than color).

The game keeps everyone invested in paying attention with the bumping mechanism and moves fairly quickly despite occasional AP. Playing optimally will take many more plays, which could be challenging to find with the right kind of players, the necessary amount of brain energy, and the time investment. That’s probably the only thing that keeps it from getting an “8” from me.

Update after 2nd play: 3 players seemed less wide open for some strange reason. I enjoyed the game more knowing the system. I don’t think this game is hits my intellectual sweet spot, but I enjoy the challenge of trying to link together the best sequences of moves.

This is such a clever game where everything is so interconnected. The only issue I see is that while you have 1 choice of 8 different actions each turn, it can be complicated to figure out exactly which action will accomplish your goals. You have to think several steps ahead, and this can really slow down some players.

Az egyórás szabálymagyarázat után nem sok reményt fűztem a játékhoz, túl bonyolultnak tűnt fölöslegesen. Szerencsére kellemes csalódás ért. Természetesen első játékra még tapogatózik az ember és tényleg nagyon összetett, de euró létére szerintem rettentő tematikusra sikerült. Galériatulajdonosokat alakítunk, akik minél magasabban kvalifikált művészek alkotásait próbálják kiállítani a műtermeikben, olcsón megszerezni ezeket, majd később értékesíteni. Van egy saját táblánk, ahol a műtermünket és dolgozóinkat koordináljuk és van egy fő tábla, ahol három különböző típusú ember kegyeit keressük. Az egyikük a pénzember, a nevéből adódóan pénzt hoz a házhoz, a másikuk befolyást, a harmadikuk pedig joker, mind pénzügyileg, mind befolyásügyileg segíthet minket, sőt a művészek népszerűsítésében is szerepet játszhat. Ugyanis a játék része az egyes művészek futtatása is, hogy minél népszerűbbek legyenek. A játék elemei fantasztikusan minőségiek, a grafikai is szép. Csak jót tudok mondani a játékról. Egyedüli negatívum az elején említett bonyolultság. Ez tipikusan olyan játék, ami mellé nem lehet bárkit leültetni, de egy geek biztosan élvezni fogja. Bőven van mélység a játékban, tetszett.

My nominee for most elegant pawn design to date. A lot going on in this game. I like the idea of getting a bonus action when someone bumps one of your pieces, but keeping influence high enough makes this an option you won't be able to use nearly as often as you would like. Art work images are too small and the game has a very annoying color scheme: pink with brown, really?

Way too convoluted for what it is! Makes the gameplay a constant struggle to hope you're following all the fiddly rules & icons. Far too many better games to play that are a lot more enjoyable.

Warming up to it finally after 5 plays. One of the few games I've paid retail for, so I forced myself to stick with it. Will stay in the collection though I doubt it will make my top 100.

EDIT: Huh. MAYBE we finally got on the rules right. 8 plays and now #52 on my list, though there are several not yet rated that will pass it. On the other hand, it does keep moving up the list. Huh.

This is an early assessment, but so far I think it's pretty darn cool. So many different levers to pull and paths to get stuff / do stuff. A real brain burner (at least for me, this is the heaviest game I've played). I like the way the theme comes out in the game. You really feel like you're an art dealer trying to wheel and deal. The board is incredibly busy and there are a fair number of fiddly bits but it's all well designed with lots of clever graphic touches to remind you of what you're supposed to be doing (a boon in a game this complex). I don't love the color palette (it's fine, just a little more pastel blue/grey than I like) but I do love the quality of all the components. This is a premium game, a cut above my other games, a work of art on your shelf.

Edit: A few more plays and I'm still loving this game.

I'd really like to play this again. I had real trouble with the initial play of being able to see how all of the elements connect together, and especially how to make really decent moves. Given all of my gaming experience, this was a very unsettling feeling for me. It seems that a decent amount of how well you are going to do is dependent upon others generating fame for your artists, and I'm really struggling to see how much control your own play has in generating the victory. Perhaps credit should be given to those that are most opportunistic. At any rate, maybe another play would sort this out and I can give it a true rating.

UPDATE: I played it again, and yup, I don't really like it. I think it's too tight and that the actions are too abstract to really connect easily. Sure, I get promotion of artists, but you spend prestige that you have to take a special action for, and only the pink meeples really help you out. You get pink meeples through tickets that you pick up by purchasing works of art and maybe as a side effect of a couple of other actions. This circular, very tangental dependency was hard to wrap my head around, and I spend most of my turns debating which of a bunch of very ineffective actions I'm going to do that maybe might set me up 3 turns from now to eke out a couple of coins. As an experienced gamer, I don't have a problem usually in abstract or tight games, but this just isn't fun for me at all. Give me a game where there are some effective actions, where there can be a path to get from point A to point B. On top of that, the collectors (white meeples) are super important and based on luck of the draw and other players' action is whether or not they even come available. Finally, what the other players do really does have a significant impact on how well your artists (and effectively you as a player) do, meaning that much of a really tight game is out of your control.

The game looks great; it is a _very_ nice production! It's another action selection game, with an arty theme. But you're a gallery owner, not the artists (who are abstracted away to a large degree). Your job is to discover artists, buy their painting(s), promote them, attract visitors to your gallery to see their art, and sell the paintings for profit (to one of those visitors). There's not much brand new here, really, but there is a lot of cool stuff put together into a very cohesive whole:
- Being kicked off your action space, you get to take that action again (by spending influence).
- You can hire additional assistants, which you can leave behind when you choose a new action. They, too, can get kicked out and give you that action again; managing these bonus actions seems very important.
- There's an influence track, where you can convert that influence to coins and/or actions as needed
- A separate area to acquire scoring multipliers (sort of like in Nippon!); these consume your assistants for the rest of the game, so you need to balance that with the benefits of having your little helpers running around.

Another excellent game by Vital Lacerda ... I wish I'd Kickstarted this after all!

RATING: 7
This is a worker placement/economic game about managing an art gallery.  There was a game I played years ago called Pret-a-Porter that I was just warm on.  This game feels a lot like that game but improves on all the systems in my opinion.

Each round of this game a player moves to one of the four action spaces on the board.  Each action space offers two actions and the player chooses one of those to perform.  The actions each have to do with managing an art gallery with the end game goal to have the most money.  I personally think this is a really interesting unique theme myself, while some might not consider it the most exciting.  One of the really neat mechanics here is when a player takes an action that another player used on a previous turn it bumps them giving them an opportunity to use a "kick-out action".  The kick-out action can either be a contract card action, minor single-use actions on contract cards, or one of that spaces main actions, at a potentially high "influence" cost.  Influence is one of the currencies in the game used for many of the mechanics in the game.

This segues well into my complaints with the game.  It is really long and really hits AP-prone and overthinking players hard extending the already overlong game time.  Efficient players will attempt to take the most advantage out of kick-out actions meaning that on each players turn another player is taking a turn as well.  And there is a lot to plan and do.  Granted, that's something I like because it provides deep and varied play but it is also hard to find people who want to play a game for 3+ hours.  Also, the game is a bit fiddly.  It's not as bad as the nightmare game setup made me think it would be, but it's still not good.

Finally, this game is gorgeous.  I love well-designed game inserts and this game has one.  It is a good sized game box but it fits on my standard IKEA shelf fine and everything is well packaged and organized.  Actual art was licensed for the art on the cards and all the other game elements are clear and look neat and pretty.  And for the piece-de-resistance, there are tiny wooden easels for holding certain art tiles.  They're adorable!

Great work from Vital, as always, pushing all of the elements together and combining them in order to make the theme work better. A solid design for more than 2 hours. The way the kicking works is nice but it drags the gameplay a bit more than I would prefer.  Gameplay is not complicated but all of the small steps for almost every action make it too complex to execute.

Beautifully produced game, great as it helps with the iconography but a bit sad as the game play feels largely unconnected to it's theme (unlike cO2 and Vinhos).

I love Vitals games.

This is beautiful and plays quite fast (in comparison to other deep games). There are some critics of the end game scoring. But that's exactly what the game is about. 

You have to have an eye on the end game scoring and optimize your actions for gaining the most money at the end.

And that's what makes the replayability. Another masterpiece from the master.

Edit after 7 plays: Rating down from 9.5 to 8.8. I still like the game but right now I prefer others.

As I sat for the first run through the rules the game kept getting more interesting as the rule description went on.  However after playing the game I was left with a feeling of blah.  The game has all the things I like and yes yet again I ignored the end game bonuses to focus on purchasing art and was soundly beaten.  I think that the downtime between me doing stuff and the board changing enough that planning although could be down to a certain degree you still had a reasonably chance of having to modify your strategy when it was your turn that added to the downtime.  I did play with a moderate AP player but I could see this be excruciating with a  couple of AP players.

RATING: 6
Unbelievable production values (sets a new high standard). The English rule book is very good. Player aids, example of play, insert tray, overall layout, etc., everything is top-notch. 

First play impressions are mixed - there aren't that many actions to do, but there are a plethora of items to think about. A steady stream of bonuses will help keep things moving along. It just seems a bit forced to me.

[update] Well, The Gallerist ended up being a step short for us so it's been shelved. Thankfully, Lisboa has turned out to be the heavy game we've been looking for!

Very interesting, different than other games i've played, yet somehow familiar.  Rules are simple, minutiae is deep.  Little things are easy to forget as you go along.  Like needing an assistant to do some kick-out stuff or one quarter of the entire board.  The management of everything is intriguing, but also very difficult.  In a good way.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Kind of the warm-up to Lisboa, which takes a lot of the mechanical concepts and integrates them with more thematic pop.

There are so many ways to shoot yourself in the foot through small mistakes, and figuring out what matters doesn't make a lot of sense because some of the pieces just don't fit together.

Area control in the International Market feels tacked on, and yet you ignore it at your own peril since the endgame scoring Reputation tiles are crucial to winning.  

The contract bonuses on as executive actions require more forethought than you'll realize, and the penalty for not planning that out is dire and not immediately obvious as to why.

There's a bit of semi co-op with pushing artist fame (which I like), though it's sort of optional depending on the group's play style. In Lisboa, building public buildings is central to the game's core, and is going to happen no matter who is playing.

Like all of Lacerda's games, "there's a lot going on here," but stepping back and seeing the big picture doesn't necessarily help you play the game better. 

I still like this game, and I would rather play this than a most of the resource conversion/trading Euros, I just feel like Lisboa does a lot of what this game does [i]better[/i].

The Gallerist is an interesting game with quite a few complex interlocking elements. Unfortunately on replay I didn't feel like the game had changed in any interesting ways. I imagine therefore that repeated runs through the game will feel rather repetitive, and am not quite sure I'd add it to my collection even though in a vacuum it's perfectly fine.

Another great Lacerda game. Wonderful production with a good thick game behind the beauty. Like his other games, there are lots of moving parts and different ways to approach this one.

RATING: 9
I really enjoy this game. It's a worker placement game with only four available places to put your worker, but the pieces of each action are put together in such a way that it creates this really interesting web of interconnections that gives rise to some of the most difficult decisions I've encountered in a board game. However, a few things to note about this game: (1) the playtime runs long -- and the set-up is a bit long as well, (2) it is most certainly a heavy and complex game, and (3) while most of the complexity comes from the way the various systems interconnect... some of the complexity does come from some of the slight "fiddlyness" of the some aspects of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is the first Vital Lacerda's game that I played. I really enjoy playing it. It is not a game that I fully understand until the middle part of the first game. There are a lot of options for actions that may at times caused AP. Even though this game is a heavy Euro game, you will still need to pay attention to other players' actions. I really want to bring this to the table again and explore different strategy to win the game.

Excellent game. Quality of components and insert is top notch. Awesome gameplay. The only downside is that the first game lasted almost 5 hours. I'm sure the second one will be reduced down to 2.5-3h.

RATING: 8.25
One of the most elegant heavy euros I have ever played. Especially nice and surprisingly fast-paced with two players. The theme is very strong, too. Many mechanics can be explained by it, which makes them much easier to understand and memorize. Among heavy Euros, this one seems nearly perfect to me. 

EDIT: It was spoiled for me a little due to the reactions of some friends of mine. My significant other has no interest in this game as well. Still a great game, but I sold it since it will only seldom see the table anymore...

The Gallerist is a fairly well-constructed and ambitiously heavy Euro game with a strong (though unexciting) theme and seems to have multiple strategic avenues to explore. 

It is definitely a highly dense game, which I don't really mean as a compliment.  I found that its layers of complexity have diminishing returns in that they didn't add much to the fun.  It just made it more bewildering to learn.

Some other complaints about the game are that the kicked-out actions tend to make the game drag (couldn't they just trigger simple, instant benefits instead?) and the Art of International Renown doesn't seem at all worth any effort in acquiring. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
We didn't finish the game, actually we were pretty far from that, but I liked what I saw. I specifically like the ambivalence of the game. It's not tactical or strategic, it's both at the same time as you can tell especially from the international market. Will you go for more influence right away or will you improve your position for the money rating (the stuff the game is all about) at the end. Every single action you take matters.
And it's for that matter this game has a huge potential for downtime. It's a Lacerda and as such it's a brainburner, although I'd argue it's easier both to learn and to play than Kanban, CO2 and Vinhos, BUT: It feels like it takes ages until it's your turn again, even more so when your opponents get to do "call back?"-actions. I really loathed the downtime. Nevertheless, I'd gladly play this again. The game is brain and eye candy.
---------------------------------------------------
2nd game in. Downtime is really terrible, the game itself and its layers are so tightly connected, it takes time to burn yor brain, melt it even. I think this is a great design but I don't get the same joy out of this as I get from Rosenbergs brainburners for instance. Oh yeah, and a deep game such as this one deserves an equivalent rulebook. Which, unfortunately, is not the case. It's either the rulebook or the german translation that's bad. So many questions popped up during the game which weren't answered or where the answer barely touched the surface, keeping it vague and leaving you with how to interpret the answer.

I want at least one really heavy euro game - and the theme of this game sounds really interesting and like something I can get to the table with my wife. And that there is a good solo mode in the box is something I like, too, as it will help me to internalize the rules before teaching her. The first solo play was very promising and the second solo play solidified my impression. This is a fantastic thematic euro.

'ends to soon' with 2p. Solo is OK but  not worth keeping for that alone.

Quite brilliant design. Love that it's all about the Money and that you can use your "points" to invest in more points. Love that every action is so great and gives you so much stuff so you get a good sense of progression. Looks amazing! Fun theme! Quite hard to learn, but not so bad after the first game, but it does mean that new players are probably gonna get rolled over vs the more experienced - not that this is a bad thing - just good to know.

The Gallerist is the latest game from Vital Lacerda, and like all his games, there's some complicated interesting choices in this game.  You are cast as a Gallerist, which is some combination of Museum Curator, Art Dealer and Art Promoter.  You'll be discovering artists, buying art, promoting artists, selling art, and trying to compete in the international market for reputation and a chance to win an auction for an internationally renowned work of art.

Before going into the gameplay, I want to mention that this game is just beautiful.  The box looks more like a piece of art than a board game.  The art tiles that you buy, sell and display in the game feature art submitted by actual artists.  The production quality on this game is over the top.  The box, tiles and chits are all super thick cardboard.  There's a custom insert with a clear insert cover to keep everything in it's place.  There's a screen printed bag, easels and lots of bits.

In the game, there's only four action spaces.  On your turn you go to an action space and do one of the two actions available at that spot.  Either before or after your turn, you can do an executive action (which isn't nearly as cool as your main action).  That doesn't sound that complicated... but oh my is there a lot to think about in this game.  

First of all, if someone wants to do the action where you currently are, they have to kick you out.  If they kick you out, you get a chance to do something after their turn... which could be to take an executive action or if you care to spend influence you can take that location action.  And on a player's turn, when they leave one location to go to another, they can leave behind a meeple... who can also be kicked out by other players.

Secondly, there are a lot of things in the game that have the possibility of triggering some sort of bonus.  So figuring out your main action often includes trying to determine if there are any special bonuses available on the board that would be useful to trigger at the moment.

Thirdly, there's an international market, where there's 12 endgame scoring tiles you can pick up, all of which can trigger one of six bonus spots on your player board.  This one area can be overwhelming in and of itself.  What end of game goal do you want to get and what immediate bonus do you need?

And of course, there's the standard goals of the game, trying to buy art at a low price and sell it at a higher price.  Trying to promote the artists whose work you own to increase it's value.  Trying to meet your particular starting goals about which art you want to sell during the game and which art you want to have on display at game end.

For a game with just a few action choices per turn, there's so much to think about.  I love the challenge of this game and look forward to playing it more.

Sometimes I play a solo mode if a game offers one, just to help learn the game before I teach it to my wife. Once I've learned the rules, I never play the game solo again. This one, solo mode is pretty fun; I could see actually playing it sometime. 

After a first two-player game, which I lost but had fun and my wife won but wasn't exactly sure why, I think we're definitely going to like this one. Later: after a few more, yes, love both game and components. The bits are a pleasure to handle; the game has a let's-play-again factor as you try to master the pace and strategies.

After quite a few more plays: We like this game a lot, LOVE the components (it was pricey, but actually worth it), but we have inserted a couple of house rules that I'm sure the designer wouldn't be happy with. I do feel they are needed, at least for 2p, which is our only experience so far. Otherwise, we think there are unfair random swings that happen. So this is in very steady rotation, and we want more from Lacerda, but because we had to tweak the rules, I'm lowering it to an 8.

A lot of better games do a lot more with a lot less. 

The low score isn't because it's a bad game, but because I've spent a couple too many hours on this dry action sequencing game without any standout moments. I'm not sure how much time I'm meant to give it.

RATING: 9
As of when rating, I have ~10 plays (2 player) under my belt.  With those 10 plays, I am enamored with the game.  On one hand, I keep thinking I'll start adopting the same strategy to winning every game (because there are seemingly limited options), but then I realize how many small factors really vary each game and what a heavy impact that has on the strategy you choose. 

With that said, some pros/cons:

Pros:
+Beautiful game; high production value - solid, durable, attractive components
+Less stressful than some worker placement games that where others can "block you."  This allows you to plan your strategy a bit better in advance.  But don't think that means there's no advantage to taking a space someone else wants--it just gives a potential extra turn to the player who held the desired location.  Boosts others instead of hurting you.
+Very thematic; I'm no sort of art expert but find the game interesting
+Amazing how the game can tackle so many aspects of the art industry and still have a PURPOSE for each in the game that "makes sense." 
+Good box insert
+Just a generally fun game; love seeing the fame of my artist (and thus the value of their pieces) rise through others' actions and having to balance this myself

Cons:
-Setup is fairly long, as is clean-up.  Upon finishing the game, sometimes I just sigh thinking about putting all of the components back in the box (they make a mess by the end of the game).  Setup requires a good deal of sorting, shuffling, and stacking.
-Big box (not too big though, IMO)

Confesso que me deixou confuso. A princípio, lendo o manual e vendo reviews, parecia ser um jogo altamente competitivo, equilibrado e justo. Mas na minha primeira jogatina se mostrou um tanto desequilibrado, com estratégias muito mais vantajosas que outras. Espero que novas partidas apaguem um pouco essa 1a. impressão. Tirando isso, é um euro bem grande e pesado, componentes maravilhosamente bem feitos, em todos os sentidos, desde a arte até a qualidade, e com uma temática lindamente integrada.
--EDIT--
Após algumas jogadas, minhas suspeitas se confirmaram. É sim um jogão queima-mufa de primeira! Que vale a pena ter. É difícil pegar as estratégias de primeira, mas logo vc vê o quão intrincado e bem pensado ele é. Confirmado: jogão mesmo no modo solo!

1st impression: Absolutely gorgeous game - from the moment you pull on the heavy-weight box lid until the moment you close it again, the quality of the components puts a smile on your face. This is a game that I want to love. The theme is one that interests me, so another tick there, but ymmv. Despite the rich theme, I don't find the mechanics very thematic. This is not offputting to me, but I do hear so much about Vital Lacerda's ability to fit mechanics to theme that I'm surprised (and a little disappointed) that I don't see it here. Stripping away theme and component quality (if that is even possible for such a beautiful game - it's certainly an unfair thing to do for the Gallerist!) The mechanics and systems are very opaque. I suspect that this is exactly what Lacerda fans get excited about. You can't merely glance through the rulebook and see how the systems interlock to create points. I'm three solo games in and I still don't really feel comfortable that I appreciate the cause and effect of the various actions. This doubt leads to a game experience that is riddled with self-doubt. When I take a turn in other euros I generally feel satisfied that I've advanced my game state, that I've made a good decision, and usually close to the optimal decision. With the Gallerist I don't get that same little hit of satisfaction after each turn, instead I often have this nagging doubt that I've actually achieved very little (or even achieved nothing) with that action. For some people that will make the game all the more satisfying when you get to the end game and its clear that you've done things well, but for me I think I'd rather play Great Western Trail or Terra Mystica and be constantly rewarded throughout the game. This is a very good game, one I enjoy, and one I look forward to playing more of - but I don't think it's going to threaten the games at the very top of my list. I think I want games that make me feel clever each and every turn, games that have there own arc where they seem to be spiraling out of control yet my accumulated cleverness ends up prevailing. This is not the feeling I get from the Gallerist.

Good god is this a convoluted fiddely mess of a game.  Learning this is a pretty massive undertaking, and it'll be difficult not to miss any rules.

Gorgeous production all around.  Some neat mechanisms and interplay between them.  For my own tastes though, just a bit too much stuff.  Too many steps to make anything happen.  

Everything you want to do is a 5+ step process, which some people I'm sure really enjoy, but it's a bit too much for me.  Also, I get annoyed when there are little extra layers of complication added to things just for the sake of needing to be a bit more complicated.

"Do get this bonus you first need to get an assistant, then you need to have the right color of guys in front of your gallery for the column you want to get the bonus from, but then you also have to have a painting of the right row." I'm just not a fan of having roadblocks just to have roadblocks.

Very good game that I'd recommend, but just a tad too heavy for me for the experience I get from the game. Each game seems to follow a similar (But decently different) flow and your strategy doesn't seem to really change a ton from game to game. Whether you're buying/selling digital art, photographs, or sculptures doesn't really have much of an influence on your play style. They're just different tracks to accomplish the same goals. 

It took a full first game to really get an idea of what the heck was even going on and how to be successful, so it's one of those games where you have to throw the first game out the window if even 1 player has played before. I won my 2nd game though, so I guess I was up to speed enough by then. I'd play again but there's a good number of other games I'd rather play.

It's the type of game that makes me say "Hmm, interesting" but I don't really have any desire to come back to, in particular. (A perfect 7 representative, IMO)

Deep, thematic, fused with its mechanisms and gorgeous to behold. New players are always intimidated once they hear the rules but are inevitably drawn into the play style. The choices are connected to theme, but the length of time for a game and the complex scoring keeps it from being higher.

Didn't feel that this was as overly/unnecessarily complicated as people said. Basically a worker placement game but with a nice theme where you're running an art gallery, buying works of art and exhibiting artists/building up their reputation to sell their artwork for higher prices, which are points. Enjoyed the theme and the synergy and the mechanics made it interesting. A little complicated but not as complicated as some other games, which are just dry point salads (Feld comes to mind). Would like to play this more.

A heavy euro with a lot of moving parts. Interesting decisions to be made throughout the game. It can be a little fiddly so you need to take your time on each turn and do things in the right order to make sure you don't miss a step, of which there can be many. At the end of the game you can accumulate a massive amount of points, which is very hard for other players to account for. So the winner at the end can be a huge surprise.

This is a fairly standard Vital Lacerda release. A game of very simple actions linked across various mini-games that create a nearly impenetrable web of cause and effect. Most moves are purely tactical, as you examine the board searching for the best way to generate a given resource at any given time. There are some very innovative mechanics like the worker push, where instead of having previous placements block a space, they allow later arriving workers to go ahead and activate a space, but the earlier placements get to trigger the space a second time, creating a very interesting dynamic between doing what you want to do and feeding your opponents extra actions.

It's going to take a few more plays to figure out exactly how much control you have. I can't find much of any at this point, but I suspect that will come, as it did with Vinhos and Kanban. Regardless, it's a beautiful production cast with both a loving eye and a critical commentary on the art of making an artist.

It's no Vinhos and the thematic implementation is a little flaky. Nonetheless it's a decent brain burner, very beautiful, and interesting to play.

Under review, but I really want to try and hang on to this if I can, the theme is just too good and modern to boot, still rare for board games.

Sooo overcomplicated. You wait for others to semirandomly give you plus actions and not screw you out of those actions you actually want to do. Filled with arbitrary and meaningless set collection too. No sense of building anything, you just go around and somehow it's points. The influence track feels random. Oh i only need to go down one step to get this so it's worth it. Oh no now it's five steps i guess i don't do it.

Vital does it again.  Another gamer's game with solid play.  Very clean system with less hard to remember rules than either Co2, Kanban, or Vinhos.

The art is cool. The biggest problem with the game is also it's most unique point; Kicked-out actions, which have the potential to severely lose track of the game order etc. Fortunately, this is easily fixed by using something to track whose turn it is currently.

Excellent game, but suffers from an enormous level of complexity.  So, while it is 
a very good game, it is hard to get to the table.

Competing art galleries in a heavy worker placement, with auction, set collection, and commodity speculation. Discover new artists, commission original works, speculate and raise their value by spending influence to build artist reputation, display your works in your gallery, entertain VIP's, attract visitors. Earn tickets, fill contracts, and bid on the international art gallery. So much going on. This game does a great job with the bonus bump action on worker placement which helps to keep other players engaged when it is not their turn. A lot of fiddly tokens placed on the tiles but it is a fun random element. I like the mechanic of spending influence for cash. Lots of ways to go with mind boggling choices.

The displaced actions felt like they slowed down the game but disrupting turn order/flow. Overall, not a bad game but also not an outstanding one. Production quality was good but artwork was meh.

I had waited a year for this, and was severely disappointed when it finally arrived.  Yes, it's an intricate web of systems, as any good Euro will be; but most of the systems are lazy and unoriginal -- especially that rightfully notorious "international market," which is just a grid of bonus tiles.  I like the game of waiting (or not) to see if an artist's fame rises, but, really, it's just a stock market mechanism.

There is really no variability from game to game.  The differences among the artists of a given color are meaninglessly subtle and all come out in the wash.  It is satisfying to land an artwork and especially to designate a masterpiece, but everything else is entirely uninteresting.  Such a waste!

And although the graphic design is stunning and the component quality is commensurately overproduced, the actual artwork is poor.  It's the kind of art you see in the coffee shop and feel a little sorry for.

*Tentative rating after 2p and 4p games*

Immensely different 2p vs 4p experience. Rather brutal when you don't create the opportunities to enrich your gallery further, especially in regards to bringing in more meeples. 

2p : min/max-fest. Enjoyed it.

4p : intricate interplay during player turns adding further depth of choice making.  Enjoyed it.

Excellent game.

尽管从机制方面来说，gallerist不算有什么非常亮眼的地方，但是极其丰富而统一的元素构成了许多个良性循环的路线。如果说对于长期沉浸于德式游戏的玩家而言这款游戏总会玩着玩着发现有一种似曾相识的熟悉感，那么对于接触过一些德式而想进入深策的玩家来讲，这无疑是一款教科书式的游戏。

Such an awesome experience. The components truly are top notch. On the surface, the game looks pretty easy. How hard can 4 choices be? Then you realize how it all ties together and how your choices two turns ago prevented you from doing what you should have done and now another player has bought that last work of art that you needed but if you get the right bonus tile you just might be able to get enough money to squeeze out enough points...and on and on and on.  It's wonderful.  The presentation is great. The rule book is superb, and the player aids are better than any I've seen. And the kick out mechanism? I love it.

It's a shame that after learning it and enjoying the game it hasn't hit the table again in months. I'd have to go back and relearn this one which is no mean feat.

This game is sitting there mocking my puny commitment to its systems. It has been too long and despite trying to get this to the table a couple of times we've aborted due to rules learning fatigue and picked something we already know. It's going to take a concerted effort over a holiday to get this one played again.

A bad experience as beginner. Not really my type of game. It is too long, I didn't enjoy it because no body talked, it is very dry and I was lost because partial understanding of the mechanics, in addition, everything was connected with everything so if you don't know what to do from the begining you are going to lose your time if experienced players don't give you a hand. Overcomplicated, mechanics has no sense for me. It is beautiful indeed.

[b]1p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] It's a lot of setup for a solitaire game, but at least the rules are almost identical to the normal game. It is fun to manipulate Lacerda (and more importantly, avoid him and his cronies). Succeeding at the right combination of things to achieve a solitaire ranking is quite challenging, and requires a lot of goal-checking. In my first solitaire game, I failed at 60% of the requirements for Apprentice, but by getting just three more things, I would have been a Master Gallerist (but still would have failed at all of the lower levels). So, it's interesting that Master Gallerist can be achieved through riskier play that would not get you the other levels. Playing solitaire just makes me want to play it with humans.

Although I suspect I will like this more against human opponents, the solitaire game does what I like:  Gives you challenges that are unique to the solitaire game, so you have a reason to play it, other than having no playmates.

Nagyon élvezetes, tematikus és kőkemény euró. Kifejezetten tetszett, még ha nem is sikerült elsőre túl jó eredményt elérni. Egyetlen negatívum, h nekem kicsit hosszú, illetve a "kilökés" miatt gyk. nem lehet előre tervezni, de maga a mechanika meg jó és helye van ennek is a játékban.

OMG, this game is amazing.  The production value is just the start... the game play is elegant and the interconnected mechanisms offer a great challenge.  All the while, you don't have that much to consider on your turn.  There are only 3 or 4 places to go and once you've made that choice, you have 2 things you can do.  There is just so much goodness in this beautiful box, I can't wait to play it again.

Some general remarks about the feel of the game : 

+ Interwoven clever game design
+ Not that complicated rules, clear and useful overviews
+ Meaty and depth without convoluted mechanisms
+ Theme and game are abstract: it's not about art but about the product art
+ A good amount of different strategies are possible
+ A good amount of choices : game makes you constantly consider taking short term boosts/choices that may be not that beneficial in the long term and may help other players more
+ The game has a puzzling feel : how to combine all the smaller pieces
+ Quality of components is great
+ Influence track is a really good mechanism


After 4 plays and 1 solo play : 
Enjoyed all plays of it and it kept me up until late at night just thinking about the clever interconnected design choices. I'm starting to see a few completely different strategies, which I always love in a game. If a strategy is too apparent the first time you play it, it becomes a bit dull. This game is one of those games that needs several plays to get to the heart of it, and that's very fine. 

About perceived complexity: 

Is the game complex? Yes and no. There're only 8 actions and it's really simple to explain them. They also can be explained thematically. You don't have to go through all the details, since that's on the overview sheets. There're a lot of different tiles, but it's better to look them up during the game. Their iconography is ok. 

The complexity lies in the long term strategy and understanding the interwoven cleverness and how to use this to your benefit. The game is also complex because there's a lot of smaller pieces that can influence your game, e.g. the tiles available on the artists and the kind of art they produce, the benefits of the artwork they sell etc. All these smaller pieces of the puzzle can throw a new or less experienced gamer off though (especially the overwhelming look of the international market). 
Further, the game has a few abstract mechanisms (placing a scoring tile on you player board for more benefits, for example, is rather very abstract), but luckily these abstract mechanisms are not complex. This is not the game that is complex because of dense rules or baroque mechanisms thrown in, but complex because there's a lot of pieces that you need to puzzle together. 
Finally, I didn't have the feeling that the designer threw in mechanisms for the sake of it. Every bit is well integrated into the gameplay and interplays with the other elements. 

About the kick-out action interference. 

This kick-out action interrupts the flow of the game and many players will not like this, including me in my first few games. I now have a more clear view on the game and it bothers me less, since it's interwoven with how the influence track works. This influence track is a very brilliant mechanism and the kick-out thing plays a major role as one of the benefits playing the influence track well. Also I don't mind having more time to think about my moves since I feel as an AP player I can use all the downtime to think ahead. 

About theme. 

It's a complex theme to make a game about, and maybe people expected a more artsy game about art itself. The Gallerist is not so much about art or different kinds of art but about the monetization / popularization of the product art. It definately has abstract mechanisms and I can totally feel how some of my players were dissappointed this is not so much a game about art, but as art as a product. However i'm fine with the abstract theme and i didn't feel it is a tacked on theme. The artwork of the game also attracts me into playing it and loving it.

i think it is a good game, well idealized and everything works as it should, and the components are cool. But, i also think that its too long, and has many many rules and details that, during the game, makes it too heavy (at least for me) and unappealing, an dit just makes me think "when is it going to end?!" 
but i think it is a good game, just not for my type. I like heavy and rules, but not this much.

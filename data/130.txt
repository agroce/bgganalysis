The fantasy version of Empire Builder. I actually played this before EB and really enjoyed it. The locations though, sheesh, figuring out where the hell 'Uloggh' or 'Piggnytz' is compared to say 'Miami' - EB is a LOT simpler in that regard.

This is my favorite of the rail games.  It plays much like the others, but because it is set in a fantasy setting acing high school geography doesn't give someone an edge in figuring out the best routes.

The pimped version of the crayon railroad games with a fantasy theme and more mechanics. I really enjoyed the game when it came out, but it will most likely sit unplayed on the shelf in the future.

RATING: 5
Old edition with monochrome goods and very poor component quality. It seems odd with a game like this, but the full colour cards in my recent editions of Empire Builder and Eurorails make it feel more like a game and less like a chore. It certainly makes finding the bits a lot easier. It is very likely that I am really that shallow.

Also, more complexity is not really what I am looking for. I'm sure we'll dig this out some time, but for a game this long and repetitive I don't want to be squinting at symbols if I can avoid it.

The best rail game out there.  The fantasy elements really add to the atmosphere of what is typically a dry, but fun, genre of games.  My mom and aunt played this game to the point of exausting the bank of funds, just to play.  They didn't care who won or lost, they just had a blast with the crayons and the engineers and the game.  Says a lot for the game if 50 something mostly non-gamers enjoy it this much, and regular gamers do too.  A winner, I will need to dust this one off and have another go of it sometime.

This game adds a few things to Mayfair's crayon rail system.  The way and cost of upgrading trains is smoother than the games set in the real world and conductors of different fantasy races are introduced.  The conductor you have modifies how much you pay to build in certain terrain features.

The core elements of this game are fun, but I hate the random events deck more and more each time I play.  I think games with random events should make people excited when they come up, and these do the opposite.  I think there should be more positive events and significantly less "lose a turn and a load" events.

My first crayon-train game and it was interesting.  The mechanics simple and solid, with interesting decisions to make.  However, those decisions are far apart in game-time and the periods in between were tedious (like spending 12 turns just moving my train by sea from one port to another).

The &quot;biggest&quot; of the Crayon-rails games, with a huge mapboard and lots of cities. Also the most interesting, with a few more options (hiring foremen, shipping, and more incremental train upgrades) over the basic system. If you are inclined to do such a thing, it&#039;s the best one to play with more than 3 or so players. Not that I would ever recommend playing any of these games with more than 3 players.

I don't understand the appeal of any of the crayon rail games, on turn 2 someone was eliminated because a bridge was washed out in front of him and you are not allowed to turn around and he had no money to rebuild (it was only the second turn) and so that was it, he was out. The end game was sort fun, but the 4 hrs it took to get there was worse than getting teeth pulled, I will NEVER play one of these games again!

Everything crayone rails aspired to be and became.  Brilliant terrain rules, excellent foremen idea, sea travel... and kinked by the random draw of load cards.  Someone sporting a dragon in their spare slot can make a bucket of cash and win the game with the turn of a card.  For a longer game that feels like it should have some strategy, this can be a bit frustrating.

My first crayon rails game.  The rules lack explicit clarity, but overall I think we got everything right.  The game has its charm with the crayons but it drags a bit long for our group.  Wouldn’t mind playing it again but I’m not dying to play it again.  Also wish there was a bit less luck in the cards.  Perhaps house ruling a variant where demand cards can be selected from a tableau would help mitigate that.

The best of the crayon rail games.  Plays too slow with more than 3 players.  When the box tips over all the little coins get mixed up.  So much adding of numbers and re-adding.  Oh and finding the city on the map is a little frustrating.  Despite that stuff it is a fun game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My favorite of the Empire Builder series that I've thus far tried - I enjoy the large board size, spread-out major cities, diverse terrains, and foremen.

I'm less fond of how some areas of the board tend to simply be much better to play in than others. A bit of variation along those lines is fine, but there's more than I'd prefer.

(Several of my friends play an accelerated, no-event-cards variant. I feel like most of the random hosement can be dropped without hurting gameplay, but when/if the Sandstorm crops up in an important consideration in making westward routes.)

I enjoyed this game but doubt I'll play it again, or ever feel like I need to buy it.  I like the ability to change track purchase costs by swapping foremen, but the search for cities and commodities make it tough on beginners.  Mayfair did a good job with player reference material to ease finding cities and commodities, but it's still a chore.  I'm also not a big fan of random events having this much potential impact on a game that's this long.

RATING: 7
Call me a fantasy nerd, but this is by far the best of the empire builder train games. The infusion of fantasy, expanded variety, and more unpredictable elements adds a lot to this game. Also, the planning and route tactics of the rail building really seems to tickle my fancy. I have played quite a few sessions of this game and it has become a little long in the tooth, yet I am still willing to throw down when nominated.

Oh my god, who ever designed the tray for the tokens should suffer the same afterlife fate as the person who invented the speed bump.

Amazingly the mother and Aunt of biggdork borrowed this game and played it for hours on end until the bank ran out of money. Neither was a gamer. Obviously this game has appeal.

Side note: crayons + waiting for your turn when playing with "Paul", priceless. Such quotes as "12XU' and "Rudy is Mod" were great.

Additional side note: dear lord I usually never intentionally go to extreme ends to piss someone of, but one Jason pissed me off something awful one day when he got upset at me "over" using his crayons. I mean a word or two and he flew of the handle. I even offered to buy him a whole set of crayolas and he still would get mad at me anytime I used the crayon for anything other than required game actions. So I went out of my way to make drawings everywhere. I thought he was going to jump through the table and kick the shit out of me.

My least favorite "Empire Builder" game. I don't think the fantasy theme translates well into a "train" game. Here, dragons have been made into trains somehow. I have to ignore and dismiss this concept and convert this to a "caravan" game using custom "caravan" cards with different move rates and load allowances. The only reason I play this one is for the very large map.

Multi-player solitaire.  Too random, almost zero player control over events.  Did I mention two players had 3/4 of their track wiped out due to a random event, and were reduced to drawing cards every turn to try and get goods for their last 3 hamlets to produce and deliver?  Nothing in the setup text about that...

Still impressive in scope.  Would that I could make this work!  (sold my copy to a friend who'll get more use out of it.)

This is a pretty good rail game. Creating your own rail lines instead of purchasing existing ones, combined with the fantasy element and random events, adds a level of flavor missing from more traditional games like [i]Rail Baron[/i] or [i]Empire Builder[/i]. Obsessing over routes and actually laying out the tracks can lead to some downtime, though.

This is one of those games where I will only play in "friendly mode" because I have no interest in playing with sharks who've memorized and optimized the routes and/or aren't going to let me back up a mistake.

Update: sold. Just wasn't getting to the table.

RATING: 2
Eurorails this isn't.  Board is way too big making starting hand too influential and exacerbates luck in future draws.  All of the extra crap tacked on is lame and detracts from the crayon rails experience.  Difficult and annoying to find cities.  Geek factor is off the charts.  "See we play TRAINS shaped like DRAGONS and drive through DUNGEONS to pick up WANDS and sell them to GNOMES."  Good grief, too geeky even for me.

My favorite "crayon rails" game; I've created a heavily-modified set of rules that myself and my friends enjoy, which makes it substantially heavier (bidding on contracts, unlimited simultaneous contracts, multiple trains and once, debt, warehousing, and arbitrary deals between players, to list some of the major additions!).  With those, it's a "10" in my book, but to me the base game is a bit too light and random to be an overall favorite.

I enjoy this even though it plays very much like N-way solitaire.  Some of the random events are irritating.  Can be very hard on players who make mistakes.  Gets repetitive after lots of replays (e.g. players just wait for the Rainbow Bridge event).

RATING: 2
As someone with little love for crayon rails in general, I have a special level of revulsion for to this one. 

I'm shocked that this is a game people play in this day and age. Even in 1994 you could be playing a pickup and deliver game like Merchant of Venus.

This game has little interaction. You will rarely ever influence another player, except in the rare event you hand them a few bucks to ride their rails. There are virtually no choke points, and the map is a huge square so strategic route-building is minimal.

This game has very few decisions. You just pick up your nearest good and run it to the destination. If you're lucky you might be able to nab another good on the way. Rinse, lather, repeat.

This game is too long. A delivery is a multiturn process, and you need to accumulate a dozen plus of these to complete the game, so plan for 3-5 hours of this drudgery.

Add to that the painful graphic interface, fantasy geography (where is Orig-garrrurgh on the map again?), and tiny goods symbols and you heap frustration on top of all the monotony.

The underworld could have been interesting, but being so small and expensive it isn't worthwhile. The boats could be great but they're an afterthought. The leader cards could be neat, but really and elf or a dwarf will usually be available on the discard. So the low hiring cost means that rivers and mountains are the only real barriers in the game.

The Mayfair rail games can be fun with the right group in the right mood for it. But they're all little more than multi-player solitaire, and take too long to play for the quality of experience they offer.

This game was made for (and likely by) folks who enjoyed the vintage map system of old D&D games. In today's game universe the game looks wholly outdated and is impractical on so many levels: squinting at miniature icons on the board, impossible to read crayon lines on a busy board, having to play a word search game every time you need to find a city or resource on the board, and the painfully slow way in which your train creeps over the board.

The heart of the game is a double layered route building mechanism (build a route. then move over it) which is perfectly fine, however; it becomes a serious slog to play as the win condition will take forever to reach.

It was one of the most painful games I have ever had to play.

Just got off eBay.  Looking forward to getting to know this one.  A little more complicated with the forement and ships, plus different trains.  We also don't know the locations of the cities and available loads just yet.  This map is huge!  We had to go get a new board to lay under it so it would fit on the living room table.

RATING: 9.5
This is by far my favorite rail game. Every game is an exciting struggle of risk taking, careful calculations, and dealing with the luck of the cards drawn. Cities are easy to find because they are grouped together by beginning letter and loads are easy to find with the cheat sheets. Almost every game I play becomes a close race to the finish, with the "If I could have just done this I would have won" argument at the end. Always enjoyable and very easy to play or learn. One of my favorite games because with 2 players or 6 it is always a good time.

The best map of the series with enough extra things to make this interesting. Additionally, since the cities are organized by first letter you can actually find them without knowing the geography. Given how infrequently I play crayon rails, this is immensely helpful.

The expansion made by Tom Wham adds more neat stuff but a LOT of dice rolling, so it's a mixed bag.

Suffers from the same problems of all the crayon rail games: too long, not enough interaction, yadda yadda... however, it's the most interesting theme and has the best (as of the late 90's, at least) variety of events & add-on chrome.

Probably the most interesting and balanced of the Mayfair crayon rail games.  However, I can think of at least two cautions: (1) the game is by far the longest of a series of games that already pushes the limits of acceptable length for many players; and (2) the fantasy setting may be a turnoff to some players.  The game supports a lot of players, but be prepared for a lot of down time if not everyone is a crayon rail "veteran."  I prefer Eurorails in most situations because of the shorter length.

I probably only need to play one "crayon rails" game, and this one seems like an acceptable choice. On the other hand, it's also described as "the most elaborate" of the crayon rails games.

"This falls into the crayon rails group but I really enjoy this game based on the larger board, the division between the old world and the new world, the addition of ships and forman, and an underground map.

Not to mention that its a fantasy land so there are no geographical abnormalities to deal with.

Once you learn the general locations of item on the map as well as how all the cities are pretty much grouped alphabetically its a fun game."

Only one play so the rating could easily change. My first ever crayon train game. Very enjoyable actually, it didn't seem the most enthralling at first but I soon got into it. Trying to always keep afloat with money early in the game is the main challenge. In the latter stages everyone had linked their cities and it was a desperate race to see who could get above the required money amount to win. I was two turns from victory due to an unfortunate flood destroying some of my track.

Best of the "Crayon Railroad" games in my opinion.  Rail building in a fantasy world.  But then it's too complicated for your less serious gamers that play that sort of game.  Hard to find opponents, but I was fortunate to get a good computer version to play.

If you like the "Rails" games, and fantasy settings, you'll probably like this.

I really like these crayon rail games.  This one includes foremans which chnge the track laying rules and ships which give you the ability to move around without laying to much track.

Fun game to play with some time on your hands.  Who can say no to drawing with crayons?  The beginning of the game is a good time as you have to lay the first part of the track and plan out your empire, but often the end is a foregone conclusion an hour before the end.  With a good group who has played before, you can often call the game then and declare the winner.

RATING: 9
Highly recommend getting Expo Dry Erase Markers, with the fine tips. Crayons that came with the game do not write very well on board. It was a brain-burner for my first experience. Not a very forgiving game if you don't play well early on, and thus could turn off future players. It is also very long--1 hour per player at least. There are a number of issues with the unforgiving nature of the game, as if a player is stuck, he is essentially out of the game, so we are  experimenting with a number of variants, like "mulligans" to undo poor or unproductive plays. Initial rating: "8".

Update (08/06/10): Nix that recommendation concerning dry erase--get the wet erase markers and a sheet of thin acetate (a poster frame from Walmart is $7), plus plenty of Q-tips for editing track. Increasing the speed of the trains by 2 for each level significantly speeds up the game. The sweet spot is the 4P game which takes 3-3.5 hours. A 5P game has too much down time. It is not recommended to play to only 200 GP, as the contracts in Iron Dragon are much more lucrative than in Empire Builder, so it should be played to 250 GP. Having 70-80 GP and 4x builds seems to give an advantage to the player that can get two-three high payoff deliveries early on, so 60 GP with 3x builds is sufficient. The speed of the boats should be increased 2-3 each, to compete with the trains. This is personally my favorite variant of the Empire Builder series, as the terrain is diverse and challenging, and there is sufficient complexity added with the foremen, ships, underground, and numerous types of mileposts.

Update (12/22/2013): After 27 plays, this is definitely my favorite of all the crayon rails. Raising rating up to "9".

RATING: 7
Adds more depth and options to this crayon style train game than Empire Builder, although unfortunately it also skews the game.  Depending on the day I might rate it 8 and then again 7.

If you liked the realistic theme of the other train games (not Lunar Rails), then this would detract even further from this game and make it a 6, it also adds some learning curve and if you are entirely new to crayon train games I would start with Eurorails or Empire Builder first.

Well, this is very strange and I'm still trying to decide exactly what I think about it. It definitely adds another layer of rules on top of the very simple crayon rail system. The ships, the leaders, the underground area--these are all weird and un-crayon-rail-like. Do I *like* them? Hard to say. I do think I prefer other crayon rails, but I do find it intriguing.  Naming the cities in a way that helps players find them on the map is a very smart idea. (2 plays)

I consider this the best of the Empire Builder series simply because it has the most extra stuff. You can hire ships/foremen and there is the underground... Plus you can easily find cities thanks to the clever naming-system.

Poor version of Empire Builder system.  If you do any of the following:

- underestimate the power of the boats early
- not get one of the better foreman
- build lines in the underworld early

You have no chance.  Now, I did all three, guess how good I did?  Deserves another try, now that I know what I know, but I'm not expecting this to rise beyond 6.

I love the mechanics of this game.  Planning routes, figuring out the most efficient way to bring stuff around, speculating in goods - all that stuff is gold.  But, my god, waiting around for people to take their turn is interminable!  If I had the table space to play two or three games of this at the same time, maybe.  A game crying out for a really great computer implementation.  And yes, I have the Eden Studios one, and it's too slow.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2010)

It’s been almost 6 years since I last played Iron Dragon, so I don’t remember much. I remember I thought the theme was excellent, but the playtime was VERY high, so my desire to play the game again is rather low.

I also dislike games in which I have to physically write on the game boards, that’s a huge minus for me (The Crayon Rail System is NOT for me).

If I play the game again I will come back and make a proper comment.

RATING: 6

The Crayon Rails series of games seems very easy to sum up. You have a map with cities on it, ranging from major cities to medium cities to smaller towns. Most of these cities produce goods, and the key element of the games is that the range of goods is quite wide. On your turn, you can spend up to a certain amount of money ($20 in Iron Dragon) on track or train upgrades, and then move a distance equal to your speed rating. Track can generally go anywhere, but is more expensive across some types of terrain than others (desert, plains, mountains, jungle, alpine, etc). That's pretty much it. Each player has a set of delivery cards that display deliveries being accepted at various cities, and the game is mostly in the logistical planning (layering deliveries together efficiently). Iron Dragon breaks for the norm with a completely superfluous fantasy theme and a larger-than-average map.

Games of networks and deliveries often fall flat for me, and the crayon rails series is no exception. Iron Dragon came across as one-dimensional. Merchant of Venus does this sort of thing better and as part of a more robust, feature-rich system.

I am going to give this a fairly high rating with a caveat. We significantly shortened the game. We added the rainbow bridge from the get go, and played to 100 instead of 150. The game played with 5 in about three hours. Really fun once I figured out where everything was! The events are really punitive, and add a ton of luck... Fine if you know that in advance. I want a reprint of this one, modernized with better components. I think it could really draw a lot of people in. I love the complexity of the board and the art on the cards...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While some fun in creating the rail lines, the randomness of event cards can screw you in the early game.  The end game can also be problematic if your opponent gets higher paying loads to deliver.  However, if you've been burned in a previous game, you know to have a cash reserve in case some of the random events cause you to rebuild parts of your track.  It does offer a lot of interesting choices.  I'd rather play one of the games that is on a real map, like Empire Builder though.

Played once, 4 players.  Soooo much better than I expected.  This game was my first foray into this series of games, and I'm looking forward to trying some of the others.

I think the game would benefit from a loan mechanism.  Also, the fantasy theme was just unnecessary.

Really wanted to like it. I was part of the playtest group. Look for me in the rule book! (oh wait, they accidentally left me out. Darn.)

Still, it's different, so it hits the table every couple years. Not as elegantly balanced as Eurorails or either of the NA rails, and the racial powers just aren't good enough.

Has some fun fantasy-themed eye candy. In the end it is too long for what it delivers.

This was my first experience with true crayon rail game and I wasn't that impressed.  The random goods deck with random events seems to be overly destructive.  Having a couple of random events hit you early seems to have a dispraportionate impact on that player.  The game is also a kind of multiplayer solitare and if one person gets a good lead the only thing that can be done is to hope that the cards don't come out to his advantage.  

For a game that lasts this long, these issues are a bit much for me.

One of the best of the railgames due to the added chrome (foremen, underground, etc.), but too long for me for the type of game it is.  I don't always mind the "multi-player solitaire" aspect of the crayon rails games, but this one is long enough that I'll often pass.

Has more variety in strategies than Empire Builder, and the grouping of cities semi-alphabetically is a major help. The computer port was well done.

Empire Builder meets dragons... well not really dragons... more like trains that pick stuff up and carry it on tracks to various destinations for money...  

But like dragons they breathe fire, fight each other, and have a tendency to eat people...  oh wait... no they don't... they're just trains.

Why why why why.

Game in a Nutshell: Build crayon lines across a big map then transport a vast variety of goods with your own personnel train to wherever they are in demand. 

Played as: 2 player

Pros: Remarkably simple rule set. The expansive map the game is played on really lends to the feel that you're exploring new corners of the world as you expand your rail lines. Nice stack of "Demand" cards throws in just the right amount of randomized variety to ensures no two games will play out the same. Often the funnest part of games is that you get to build something from the ground up and what's more fun then doing it with crayons? Maybe moving your little train along them? By the way, you actually get your own train (take that other "train" games... I'm looking at you Steam and Ticket to Ride)! 

Cons: Bad, really bad, art-work. Not a lot pushing the "fantasy" theme. I would say this game is largely 90% optimization. In other words, it plays like a puzzle. There's not a lot of interesting "decisions" or interaction, mostly staring at the board trying to figure out how to best puzzle-piece the hand you're dealt. If you have even one or two people who insist on playing a perfect game, bring a book or some knitting jobs to the table because you could be waiting a long time. It's a 300 piece jig-saw puzzle made complicated only by cutting it up into 3000 pieces.

Other: This is the only crayon game I've played to date, so I can't make any comparisons. I actually enjoy the optimization so long as people don't get too crazy about it. I tend to play with a little timer in my brain that says, "ok, you've thought about it long enough. It's time to do something even if it's wrong." I wouldn't want to play any other way and have rated it assuming the best. The game works with 2 people pretty well but involves very little interaction.  

Best Use: Not for the AP prone, a simple yet satisfying pure optimization game for 2-4 players.

I've only played this as a two-player and it worked just fine.  It starts off slow but as rail gets laid it starts picking up quickly.  It's really just a pick-up-and-deliver game but the fantasy element helps to keep it from being too dry.  I could see how this could get extremely vicious with even just 3 players.  I couldn't imagine playing with 6!

All crayon rail games are pretty much created equal, but this one is a small but measurable improvement (for me), because of the addition of several new mechanics (boats, underworld, foremen).

This crayon rail game introduces a few new ideas to the system. I like the foremen and love the ships/sea movement. I didn't care so much for the underworld as I can't see it coming into play very often (maybe if you have multiple demand cards that want ale, but that would be very rare). Also, be prepared for major frustration your first time out as the geography is a chore to learn.

I really like this implementation of the Crayon Rail system.  I found the terrain to be varied and interesting, making for richer gameplay.  I also appreciated the $10 train upgrades, which help a lot with flexibility.  The idea to have nearby cities all start with the same letter was a brilliant way of helping people become familiar with the geography.  On the other hand, I didn't think the role cards added much, and I wish the underground region was not as difficult to use.  In any case, this is one of the better Crayon Rail games, I think, but I wouldn't use it to teach the system.

The new components are much improved over the older edition, but it should have been much more closer to a $50 MSRP instead of $60. The difference between this and the other editions of Euro Rails or Empire builder is that this one has a slightly more colorful map, better designed cards and cardboard chits instead of plastic tokens.

The most unique of the crayon rail games, with a fantasy theme & several stand-out features:
- foremen providing bonus abilities
- water transport
- underground routes
- better train progression
- more types of terrain

Probably takes about the longest to play out of any game in the series due to all the additional elements though.

Despite the length, this is an enjoyable member of the series, especially if you like the fantasy aspects.

NOTE: Rules don't include the usual "Honeymoon" variant for 2 players (involves removing one of each type of good & lowering connection limits to cities) or any of the other variants for faster play etc. - but they seem just as applicable, so no reason they can't be used.

Empire Builder in a fantasy world.  Basically the same game with magic: lots of choices to make, but little player interaction as they race to accumulate the winning amount of money. I felt the choices available were a bit too limiting and the victory condition a bit too arbitrary, but I enjoyed the game as I played it, more so because of the fantasy theme.  Gains a small amount in the ratings vs. Empire Builder because it has a red dragon.

Love this game. If in the mood for a crayon train game this is at the top of the list. Need to have a good 3 hours to play and that limits the game play for me. I seem to like a quicker game. I would rather get a number of games in during the evening rather than one.

The crayon rail games have fallen out of favor in our household.  We used to play them all quite a bit.  Now it is rare if they reach the table more than a couple of times a years.

RATING: 6
I enjoy Iron Dragon, and parts of it I enjoy quite a lot. But with five players, there is significant downtime. And although the event cards help to add uncertainty to the game, they often add it in ways that simply deny you a turn. Waiting several minutes for the other players to move, then finding that you can't do anything, then waiting again... that part gets old fast. I lost three turns in a row during my first game, and my rating dropped a point for that reason.

In spite of these flaws, the Empire Builder series of games are fun, and I enjoy them. Iron Dragon brings extra features and interest to the base game, and is well worthwhile... my grumpiness about event cards notwithstanding.

I think this is a better game than what I've rated it.  It just loses a couple of points for being so long.  Mechanically, it works very well.  While I don't mind some randomness in a game (I think the randomness of the foremen and boats is just right), I really don't like the randomness of the events. The valuation of the loads is a contributing factor to the length of the game.  But all in all, this is a good game.  P.S.  The artwork on the foremen cards creeps me out.

This has easily become one of my favorites of the Empire Builder series.  My favorite addition is the use of ships, which can allow you to deliver loads without the same capital investment that might otherwise be required.  This is particularly true for long, high-value deliveries.  I also like the idea of the foremen, though changing them can be quite annoying.  Another nice touch, is that the alphabetical grouping of the city names makes it much easier to find them, particularly compared to India or Nippon rails.  Finally, I prefer the graded engine improvements in this game over that in the original.  I still prefer straight Empire Builder, but this is giving it a run for its money.

This is supposed to be the best of the crayon-train games.  It probably is.  However, it's quite different than the others.  This one involves a fictional map, making location determination a bit difficult, although the cities are essentially grouped together to make this less choatic.  The fantasy game element allows you to change the racial makeup of your locamotive conductors and a few other things involving magical connecting cities, boats, and underground cavern.  As with many older games, it can be a bit long.  I wouldn't want to play it all the time, but I think it could be fun to play every once in awhile.  Our game almost ended in a three-way tie, so it might be better balanced than one might think.

I've only played this with 2 and I'd like to play this with 3 sometime as well, but any more and I fear that the game would drag dramatically.

By the time Mayfair got to this one, they had pulled out all the stops. A fantasy setting for their standard crayon game mechanics give Iron Dragon opportunities that the other games don't have. Ships and a game board designed around different races makes for interesting options. I only wish that they'd have gone a little crazier with the disasters. After all it's a fantasy land, why not have players swap locations with other players or have their loads change randomly from one thing to another!?!

A great idea when it was called Empire Builder,  but Iron Dragon is one of the most disappointing games I own.  The map is a fantasy setting, and nobody knows where any of the towns are located or where you can find any resources.

RATING: 7
Sometimes it's hard to find the destinations in these rail games, particularly with India Rails and British Rails.  This problem is solved in Iron Dragon as the cities are conveniently grouped by letter (The destinations beginning with K's are all in one area)  A light fantasy feel.  If you are a beginner to this series, seek out Empire Builder (If you're from the US!)

We really like the added complexity of being able to charter ships and hire different foremen to gain track-building advantages over certain types of terrain.  Of all the games my friends and I own, this is the one that gets played the most often.

I need to give this one a second look. I remember being vaguely intrigued by the popularity of crayon rail games and this one offered an interesting theme as well. I’ve only played one or two solo games and they came off a bit flat. I remember thinking that moving various types of cargo should have more of an impact than just cash. It could be that I lost a lot of the impact playing solo.

Long game. I enjoy the game play with building track and picking different routes. I hate the events; lots of random hosage. We took to just pulling them all out.

Overly complex with ships and all. While I like it--especially the location-coded names--it seems to be the Empire Builder game I'm least likely to suggest playing, as it plays long.

RATING: 7
I like how this game has more steps of the train upgrades and adds in boats. Unlike other rail games that have foreign geography, cities are easy to find because of the naming convention used on the map. (All the "R" city names are near each other in the "R" region. The "U" cities are underground. When you ask players "Where are the Ds?" it's usually found in a few seconds and then you only have a few square inches to look over to find your city.)

After 1 play, rating was 4 because it seemed too easy to make an unforgivable mistake. The second play went much smoother and easier, everybody knew what was important and we came out with a quite close victory.

If the graphic design was better and a little better organized with good player aids and easy to find goods symbols, the game would be much better. The long play time is another minus.

A different take on the Empire Builder series.  I used to think it the bottom of the barrel of the series but have changed my mind on that harsh assessment.  If the fantasy drag the game is dressed in can get even RPG gamers into a train game, well how cool is that?

My first playing of a crayon rails game. I liked it a lot, but I'm wondering if I liked it so much because I broke out an early lead and never lost it. I had a couple of fairly easy to navigate big payoff tickets in the initial draw. Doesn't seem like it would be a normal occurance, but being the runaway leader isn't a fair way to judge a game. Must play again soon.

A very cool fantasy themed train game...make your connections with the crayon type.  Great part of the Empire Builder series, albeit the game tends to drag on a bit longer than it should.  Maybe the other crayon games are quicker due to smaller maps?

I really like this game, but experienced players are hard to beat.  Probably several games will be required before having a real understanding and ability to be victorious.  It is a little long, but time goes quickly when you're having fun.

Nice, long, heavyish game that gives everyone plenty to think about over 3-4 hours.  Can be sped up by reversing the action order within the turns.

Great theme, lovely board, lame card art.

This game took us forever to play.  We had 5 players, and it tooks us like 5 nights of 3-4 hours of play each to finish the game.  It still gets a 7 because I enjoyed it, but it probably won't get played much due to the time investment.  A shame.  I don't know how the session reports with 4 players finished it in a single sitting, but we never switched foremen, and I think that dragged it out some.

A lot of possibilities to explore here. Obviously doesn't have the real-world foundation which lends atmosphere to the historical EB games, but might be the most interesting *game* of the series. Ship movement may not be strong enough to really be useful.

10 years ago I gave this game a 9 since I love games of these kind but I have dropped the rating since it lacks interactions with other players and since you have to think a lot when getting a new card and that stops all other players from acting. I still love the construction concept though :)

I had heard that this was the most far-reaching of the crayon rails series, with more richness and variation than the other games in the series.  Unfortunately, it's not enough variation to get me interested.  I'm not a particularly big fan of the rail games in general, but I'd still rather play [gameid=168], as the differentiation in map and loads don't interest me enough to play a whole different game.  I don't dislike fantasy theme, but I do prefer the easy geography of the USA version.

Interesting, but it takes an awfully long time, and the downtime between turns can be excrutiating.  There's some unnecessary randomness, but without it, I think the game would grow dull and repetitive.  I don't think this game is for me.

This is missing the original rules and crayons.  The number of chips counts out correct, but several are blank, so there may be some missing but I can't tell without the rules.  With that in mind, this game comes as is.  The box has a little dishing on top, but in good shape overall, with no split corners.

another crayon rail game.  i've played it many times, and was really mad at it once when some disaster destroyed too many sections of my track.  however, it is fun for the fantasy theme and the special character cards add flavor and tactics.  probably my favorite of the crayon rail games.  After more plays, it seems someone always gets into a position where they don't have any money, and don't have any deliveries, and their track is insufficient to hope for deliveries.  We've considered implementing a "loan" system to cover this, as it's really un-fun to have a player sit there and draw cards turn after turn.

As usual in this series, once front-runner had good business cards in his hand it is very hard for other player to compete with him.
Otherwise, this is a really good game.
I think this is the best in the series, because the world is unique and foreman rule is interesting and alphabetically organized map is easy to play.

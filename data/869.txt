i like the similarities to ricochet robot but what i feel Bongo is lacking is the chance for a really hard puzzle that takes a few minutes to figure out. each turn is just a sprint to go through the same steps. give me them robots any day of the week over this.

Cute little dice & speed game for 2-5 players.  Mostly a filler, but there can be a lot of anxiety and tension.  Game is better when you use the advanced rules.  I wish that someone would sell the green "Ranger" die separately for those of us that own the 1st edition in the tube.

RATING: 6
A game that like Set I enjoy far more than I like.  It scratches a similar realtime pattern matching itch to Set while remaining its own game.  Well worth playing and one of those games that tends to get played several times in a row due to the simple frustration of good play.  

While the base game is fine, I prefer playing with both the poachers and the park ranger.  The degree of twist they add to the game is small as they can usually be safely ignored,but they can't be ignored just enough to make the them interesting.  I've thought seriously of buying a second set and adding a hand-coloured pair of breeding dice that adds one of the not/shown type.  

  Update: I understand now that this was in fact an early expansion for Bongo.

Oh, and my elder son slaughters me.

Update: Bongo is an odd one for me.  I'm bad at it, but I can reconstruct my mind into something that is at least partially good at it, and can then by an effort of continuous will, hold my mind in that shape while playing the game.  Then, when the game is over, I let go and everything I've built in my head falls back apart as it relaxes.

A lot of that is why I like Bongo.

This might be a good filler in a group of gamers who all love games like Ricochet Robot, but who don't have a copy of that game handy.  I don't have such a group, so, after a year or so of not having the opportunity or inclination to play it, I passed it on to someone who will appreciate it more.  My few attempt at playing suggested that it would get old VERY quickly.

RATING: 5
Catchy puzzle solving game where everyone plays simultaneously, a bit similar to Ricochet Robot. Seven dice are rolled (9 in the "advanced" game) and the die roll combination forms a question and an answer. The first player to announce the answer wins a token, and first to a set number of tokens wins the game. It's the sort of game, like Ricochet Robot, where some players will be much better than others and win easily, but it's a filler, so it shouldn't matter too much.

Eh, I actually tend to enjoy speed recognition games, but this one is far too easy.  If you have the right kind of brain wiring, you'll find the answer in about 5 seconds (even with the poachers) and no one else will ever have a chance.  It's just the same simple algorithm every time.

Bongo is good for what it is: a pattern recognition game (sort of). It does suffer from the same problem that all games of this type do -- if one player is significantly better than the others, they might as well not bother playing.

I do like the pivotal rule that non-matching symbols indicate the third option (e.g., rolling a "1" and "3" means that you're looking for "2" of something). That said, I don't find the process of actually figuring out each roll particularly pleasurable. (Contrast this with Ricochet Robot, where I find figuring out the solution to be great fun.) Given that the game is mostly this process repeated again and again, Bongo is merely mildly interesting for me.

I noticed Bongo! when Bruno Faidutti had a link on his website to a rethemed online solo variant of it called Haunted House which is done by Emmanuele Ornella. As I enjoy speed puzzles I gave it a try and enjoyed the online format. Played face-to-face it flopped. First, not everybody will enjoy competitive pattern recognition. Second, some of the dice throws are not challenging at all, especially the ones looking for three animals, while the others don't give enough satisfaction of solving them first. Third, there's not enough variety. There's nothing here that Set, Ricochet Robots or Ubongo don't do better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Absolutely my kind of game.  I love most speed/pattern recognition game, and the higher difficulty level of Bongo! makes this a winner for me, making it stand out in a pretty crowded group of games.  Too bad I can't really find a copy.

Plays quickly and a nice mental puzzle - is it the dice depicted or the ones not depicted.  Best played by leaving the dice where they end up so your eyes have to at least scan a larger set.  Plays quickly, so a nice filler with a bit of a mental twist.  Also like the ability to adjust difficulty for the players.  Basic game, add poachers, add park ranger.

(Potential downside, it does take a bit of getting used ot the combinations...so experienced players much more likely to do better than new players.  Could see this one as a solitaire game or iPhone app where speed to get the right answer is the key.)

Cute filler that probably wasn't the best game to play in a loud room with headache coming on.....

Be that as it may, this is clever dice game where you are trying to identify the correct number of animlas while factoring out if any are "killed".  Not complicated but easy to make a mistake.

Like Set, this is more of a visual puzzle than a real 'game' with lots of mechanics. Players are Safari spotting. Dice are rolled which indicate which animals are spotted or not spotted. The player who calls out the correct combination as shown on the dice gets the animal token. 

2 of each of the 3 types of tokens are required to win or all of a single kind.There are fun tense moments as players are tempted to call out before everyone else at potential expense of making a mistake! Plays well with big groups. The new version has added poacher and park ranger dice to add to the brain burn.New version in the box.

A speed pattern-recognition game. Several (5?) dice have pictures of animals on them (gnu, rhino and bongo). Also roll 2 yellow dice with pictures representing 1, 2, or 3. If the yellow dice match, look for the symbol that occurs that many times. If not, look for the symbol that occurs the OTHER number of times. If nothing satisfies these conditions, call "none". If the first player is correct, they get a chip of that type (for "none" calls, take one of your choice). If incorrect, give another player one of that animal's chip (or if "none" was mistake, give ALL your chips to other players). The first to collect 2 of each animal, or 6 of one animal, wins the game!The advanced game adds 2 red dice and 1 green. The 2 red are hunters: if they're the same, they eliminate a matching animal from the white dice; if they're different, they eliminate one of the OTHER animals (I think). The green die saves one of those animals from the hunter. Then, evaluate the yellow dice as normal.This is a fun little game, although even the basic game is tough; I think the full game would be VERY tough for most people! Probably not much fun if someone isn't quick with their visual pattern recognition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Playing the standard way is fun, though not overly challenging.  Adding the poacher dice really confused me and made it almost too challenging.  I'd like to play again and see if it's one of those games that clicks after a few tries or if the poacher dice are just too obtuse.  One drawback, at least for me, is it's hard for me to remember and distinguish which animals are showing on the dice.  I have enough difficulty recognizing common animals, much less a gnu!  Interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Normally I wouldn't like a reflex-based game like this but I actually really appreciate this one based on its incredibly clever design.

The game is reasonably simple.  You roll 7 dice, 5 of them have either a rhino, gnu, or...bongo (an antelope) on them.    The other two show 1, 2, or 3 pipes.  The goal is to be the first to name the animal based on a set of rules.

First you look at the pipes, if they show the same number then that is the target number.  If they show different numbers then the one missing is the target number.  Then you look at the animals.  If the number of a specific animal is unique to the target number you have to be the first to name that animal.  If multiple animals match the target number you have to name the other animal.  If no animals match the target number you say "none" or "neither".

When a player correctly names an animal first they get a token for that animal.  If they're wrong they lose all tokens for the animal matching their guess.  The first to collect two of each of the 3 animal tokens wins.

The dice themselves are what is so cleverly designed.  They are each ambiguous enough to make this actually quite difficult.  They are bland and devoid of color, something I would usually hate but it works to increase the difficulty of recognizing which animal is which quickly.  Also, the gnu and...bongo themselves look very similar to begin with and you can find yourself getting them mixed up in your head as well.  Sometimes you just get the actual rules mixed up because they are somewhat convoluted and say the wrong thing.

I'm not usually a fan of games like this because I don't have the fastest reflexes so find myself often at a disadvantage out the gate but I did enjoy my time playing this game because the ambiguity in the dice evens the playing field just enough that I didn't have that feeling.

I'd recommend playing this one at the end of a long game day, just to see if you can still keep up.  The brain begins to enter a Zen state by then, and it might just be the best time to play the game!  The way that players lose points for misidentifying a set, while necessary, makes the game draw out as one player's in the lead, then another player's in the lead, and then he drops back, etc.  It gets a bit annoying.

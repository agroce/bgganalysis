This game was fun and unique. It has a dry erase map board for each player and no other pieces. I liked it, You score by rolling dice (kind off like Yahtzee) then building (drawing) different structures to your city. You also have to protect your city from the pirates which because increasing more difficult as the rounds progress.

Very good dice rolling game with a neat gimmick of drawing items on a dry-wipe board - lots of tactical options arise, but ultimately the theme is completely absent. The dry-wipe board is a nice touch, but it does get messy with hands smudging etc.

Entre un euro y un filler de dados. Tiras los dados 3 veces, quedándote con el símbolo que más interese. Lo que consigues, lo dibujas en la ciudad del tablero personal, con rotulador no permanente^^ Baules, troncos de madera, casas, iglesias, muros para defender la ciudad y conseguir bonos, y personajes de diferentes niveles y habilidades. Cuidado con los símbolos piratas, que se acumulan y luego atacan a todos! 
Muy entretenido y tenso, es importante además de la suerte, saber gestionar sobretodo el orden espacial de donde construyes y la economía. 
Caja pequeña, gran juego ^^

Clever idea to combine dice and erasable markers in a building game.  It delivers everything it promises, but nothing more.  It never seems to build towards anything.  It just becomes more and more constrained until your last moves aren't very interesting.

This is more than a fancier and more complex version of yatzee. The spacial component is very interesting. Perfect game to play in the reduced space of a train or airplain table.

1st play: An upgraded version of Roll through the ages, in that it uses a similar Yatzee mechanic, but with a spatial element thrown in.  You get to build your city, fend off pirates, and write on your board.  There are some improvements in how the "bad" die face works over other similar games, and the ability to turn die can help you buy your way out of a bad spot.  

No 2nd play: I think I got a good feel for the game, and I don't forsee getting it to the table again soon.

Take the roll five dice three times element from Yahtzee and the building in a confined space element from Princes of Florence and you pretty much have Saint Malo.  What makes this game a bit different is the costly pirate raids and the possibilities for inducing them when your opponents are ill-prepared.

The artwork is unmemorable.  The dry-wipe markers have the feel of an economy measure, replacing a bunch of wooden bits, and I'm not too fond of them.

Really enjoyed this in my first and only play with a lot of players, even though I'm inclined to think it will be much better with fewer.  Markerboard is a neat gimmick that wouldn't be strictly necessary with sufficient (fiddly) components.  Simplifies the production and makes it a value-add IMO.  As for the game itself, thematic Yahtzee.

RATING: 8
it's a euro city building game based on a simple Yahtzee dice mechanism. Roll dice up to three times, choose one item to 'execute', along with pirates. The various items are logs (put logs into your lumber mill), crates (get crates to get money), crosses (gives 'series' of churches for large end-game bonuses), walls (build walls for defence and a small bonus) and heads (each head allows to put a person in your city, i.e. two heads allows you build a soldier for +1 defence; three heads allows to build a merchant who can get you one coin per adjacent crates). Pirates symbols always activate, and they tick off a track that triggers after a certain threshold, depending on player count. Once trigger, players compare their defence to the pirates' strength (it's increase after each attack). If their defence is less then the pirates' strength, they loose five points. Play continues until one person fill their entire town; after some end game scoring, whoever has the most points wins.

It's a pleasant and 'cute' light-medium euro, one extremely light on player interaction. The dry-erase boards have held up well enough, but I'm not sure if I using optimal method of cleaning them (once with a dry, then with a wet tissue paper). I don't like how they have preprinted four crates in boards; I would have perfered if they allow players to place them where they pleased. Overall, it's worth it if you can get it on at least a discount.

Roll and write with some medium weight strategy thrown into the mix. I like the dry erase boards a lot. However, I think the game tends to evolve to "who can get the pirates to attack first and screw everyone else" each round. It has happened in every single game of this I have played. Might just be my group, however.

Sort of the Euro version of King of Tokyo.  You roll five dice each turn to see what you can do.  Instead of collecting tokens are minis to place on your player board, your write on it with a dry erase marker.  Yeah it's sort of gimmicky.  It's also quite a bit of fun.  Bleh artwork and a dull name seem to have banished this game to obscurity.

Jan 2013 - Fun dice game!  You have so many spaces and various ways to make points.  Right now, after two plays, it seems like you need money early to get things rolling (building and wood) to grab the win.  I'm pretty certain different ways to win will appear.  It's like free form yahtzee.  I like the boards, etc.  I'm thinking of making color copies of the boards to have it done by pen.  I think that would be nifty, too. The writing on the board is a great idea...it keeps the game in a smaller box as it could be a bit laden game that would cost so much more for a game that is fairly light (but good decisions in it).

I enjoyed this, but I like this sort of dice game. Short on player interaction sadly, but some nice tempo choices with respect to the pirates. Drawing on the board is kind of fun in and of itself. Not winning any prizes in the alea line though. The medium-box line is rather strong actually - stronger than the big-box games have been of late - and this is not up to the standard of most of the rest. But I still found it fun, and it may yet grow on me more as alea games are often wont to do.

Interesting idea.

A game in which you think you have choices but it is not the case : The pirats, the only source of interaction (!), make the game too luck dependant for me.
And you get dirty hands after each game !

Worth trying though

RATING: 6
Saint Malo reminds me a lot of games like Roll Through the Ages, where there are various ways to score points, and you must focus on the few ways you'd like to collect points for the particular game.

There is some tension to the game, as pirates will come raid you once in a while, and if your defenses aren't prepared, they'll sap your points.  Pirates could come on the next turn, or in another 10 turns depending on how the die rolls go, so you never know when they'll arrive.

Overall, a pretty standard "roll three times, use the results" dice roller with some minor twists to make it a little different.  If you like that sort of thing, grab it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
I'm not a fan of the laminated boards- the marks you make fade over the course of the game and it is so easy to your hand covered in marker ink. But I enjoy the game tremendously. It feels like King of Tokyo for the rolling of the dice part, but then you have actual decisions to make after you're doing with that. Even if the dice determine what kind of action you'll do, how to implement that action takes strategy and thought. Most notably, you can see this in the "People" action which usually has 2 or 3 viable choices of who to add, and then another multitude of choices of where to add them. Top notch design.

While the idea of writing everything you get down on player mats is "cute", I think the game itself is lacking something. It's a dice rolling yahtzee style game, and as such not exactly right up my alley, but I guess it is still one of the better of these kind of games. Some decisions to make, and an economy to manage. Still, as it's a dice game, the randomness is quite big, and if you don't roll the kind of things you need, you can get screwed. Of course, the rule that you can change any (except for the pirate) symbol for another limits the randomness, and I do like that you can sort of pursue different paths, but all in all it didn't engage me much. I've only played it as a 2 player game, which is the player count I (and BGG it seems) think it shines at as it's mainly multiplayer solitaire.

RATING: 5
A game in the spirit of the modernist Yathzee craze which was kickstarted (haha) by Roll Through the Ages. As such, Saint Malo does a passable attempt to join the ranks of this class of titles. The touch that you draw your own city is cute, and keeps the price of the game down as supplying the bits would have been prohibitively expensive. At the same time it is one of the very few games which cause your fingers to become inkstained while playing. I'm not sure that's a Good Thing. Now this is also caused by crappy dry markers, but still.

The game itself is unfortunately somewhat limited compared to the already mentioned RTtA, especially if the players adopt the more elaborate scoring sheets to play. And that is a bit of a shame, because these games need to be played often, and thus offer a lot of options to the players. Here Saint Malo's graphical design works against the game, for it makes it very difficult to add extras to the game. And on top of all this, I'm not entirely convinced that the game properly deals with consistent bad rolls, like persistent 'great straights'. A player who rolls these misses out on efficient multiples; and the game offers little in return, it would seem.

The upshot is that although I liked Saint Malo from a general point of view, I think it ultimately too limited for more than a handful of games. Still I cannot help but like these modern Yahtzees, and might not say no if I run into a cheap copy.

[b]Update[/b] Soon after writing the above I did manage to locate a cheap copy, and proceeded playing more often. I was a bit annoyed to find out that indeed, Saint Malo does not deal well with 'bad rolls'. Someone who rolls 2x crap will lose against someone who rolls 1x crap and 1x Wall- or Person-Yahtzee. Granted, it is a simple game which doesn't take long, but the mechanisms [i]suggest[/i] there is more to matters than meets the eye. I have begun experimenting to deal with crappy rolls and hope that they will at least dull some of the sharpest edges of the design. Until I'm successful, the rate will remain put at 5.

A Yahtzee variant with a thin slice of theme slapped on top. Our first game left one of the players rating it a

rocket science. If you can suspend the gamer geek urge to massacre a game based solely on the pretext of it being a huge dice rolling Luck fest ,you might get a kick out of this game. Roll with the flow and have fun.

Since I discovered Roll throught the Ages, Pickomino and Can't Stop, I'm always looking for some nice dice games I can play with my non-gamer friends. So when I read about Saint Malo, I wanted to get it. I liked the aspect of building your own city with the dice you rolled. I thought, this might be a good setting for a fun game. 

After playing the game, I've got a little buyer's remorse. The thing I like most about simple dice games is the push-your-luck aspect. Unfortunately, it seems to be nearly absent in Saint Malo. There's always something meaningful you can do with the dice you rolled. I miss the pressure to roll a certain combination to get just what you need or lose some points if you don't. 

Saint Malo feels more like a family-oriented "feel good" game in which everyone stays in the game until the end and nothing really bad happens. This makes for a quite dull experience.

I will play Saint Malo a few more times to see if my initial impression is wrong and there's more to the game than I thought. But right now, I don't think so.

The game that King of Tokyo wishes it could be.  Right up there with Roll Through the Ages, maybe even better.  The player board construction ends up being carefully placed bets on what you think you can roll, and making the best of bad situations when you don't get what you want.  It's slick and drawing on the white board is fun.

I did not expect much from it and it was a very nice surprise that we got. Dice rolling, controllable (ok, not really :), possible to influence the result, set collection.

Very good, light-medium game.

Players are attempting to build up their influence in the French port of Saint Malo, and defend themselves from pirates.

Simple "roll dice up to three times and apply" game, in the vein of Yahtzee and about a dozen Knizia die rolling games.  The results here are applied to a laminated player board using an erasable pen.  Players want "Wall" results to earn a bonus for completing wall sections, and to bolster the city defences; "People" results fill out your town with various personnel - such as citizens, solders, nobleman, etc. - each has a different effect, but typically earning you gold or victory points.  Other results include "Goods" - filling up your city and giving merchants the chance to earn you some gold, and "Churches" which can be built in sequences of value to pay off massive points at the end of the game.

The game ends when a player fills in their 45 town spaces on their player board and some end game bonuses are paid out.  If the pirates successfully attacked, players lose five points for any attack they couldn't beat off.

This game sounds fiddly, but it's silky smooth and quick playing.  Lots of comparisons to Roll Through The Ages, but this is much more polished, with much better game tempo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm not sure that the drawing is really necessary at all?   It could easily have been a tile placement game, driven by the dice.   If you are somebody who thinks dice can hate you, then this is not the game for you, since you can only select one symbol type from the final roll.   That makes for some tough choices.  The rest of the game is pretty familiar, but still pleasant enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Every time I play this game the less interested I get. I love city building and I love dice games. What happens though is every game I feel starts to play out the same but with slight variations on order depending on what dice are rolled and when. You need walls, so you wait on a turn where you roll a lot out of the shoot for example. I don't really feel like people can take different paths and be competitive. But I'll admit, I could be wrong on that. It falls in this band where it is sort of serious but not too serious, but also light but not light enough...Like it couldn't decide which way it wanted to go. Some novel concepts but overall after the initial shine wore off a bit it's been shelved.

2015-07-17 : Pretty unique dice rolling system whereby resources are added, subtracted and convered on the player's board with a non-permanent marker.

Excellent components and graphics and a board layout which has all the rules on it, so it gains another point. Not sure if on repeated plays it will feel repetitive or not, but we'll see.

Prefer Roll Through the Ages since a bad roll still seems to add something to your empire, in Saint Malo you are often stuck on a path to victory where many of the sides of the dice create a useless effect adding to the luck of the game. Another problem is the frequency of the pirate attacks (since most players will want to roll their dice all three times, each will collect a ton of "attack faces"). The strength of these attacks escalate soo quickly repulsing them becomes pointless and yet another aspect of the game is out of your control.

The positive driving force is the fun of drawing your village, take that away, and this is a below average dice chucker.

How did I miss this one last year / 2013?  Roll Through the Ages with a relative placement (rather than completing things).  I prefer it.  Fine with two players as you're each mainly doing your own thing, with pirate attacks affecting all players.  (In fact, seems like there would be a lot of wait time with four players.) Fun!

Update:  OctoDice meets Quadropolis.  Light and easy to learn, or pick up and remember.

[2 plays] I'll try pretty much any game set in France, and this turned out to be a decently fun light dice game. It really could equally well have been set anywhere or nowhere--at least, any coastal walled city--but St. Malo was certainly an appropriate choice. The dry-erase boards are clever, though you have to be slightly careful so that when you're drawing the thing you've just built, you don't smudge out the thing you built last turn. 

It seems to me that the strategies that can rush the end of the game might be the most powerful, but I'd have to play it more to reach that conclusion definitely.

Decent game; don't see how it gets any better with more players, and it's another "absolutely nothing to do when it's not your turn" dice game.  Many different ways to score points, in a limited amount of space, so plan accordingly.

Interesting dice rolling city building game similar to both yahtzee and king of tokyo in that the first roll of the die dictate what you are going to go that turn.

The dry-erase markers and wipeable boards compliment the clean well thought out design as players are responsible for their own boards and there is no fussing around reaching for components and bit and pieces.

The pirates are scary unless you have managed to build a wall in which case, generally you are ok for a few turns until the pirates are back and twice as strong.

RATING: 7
NOTE: there's a key rule hidden in the italics. After rolling once and setting some dice aside as secure, if you re-roll the remainder and set some of them aside, then you can choose to re-introduce some of the first secure dice for a final re-roll. The plain rules text does not make this clear and seems to indicate otherwise. But the further text in italics makes it obvious. It makes a huge difference to the game-play.

Very light, largely solitaire, dice-roller, but enjoyable. My sort of visual game. Suspect it will have a limited number of plays as a generally good strategy seemed evident. Also suspect I won't play it as more than a 2p or 3p game. Ye ghods, waiting for 4 other people to roll re-roll and make a decision.

The ultimate board game to play on an airplane, as there is a lot going on, but the various resources, buildings, workers and points are all drawn on individual player boards instead of being represented by physical pieces.  It's a pretty good dice-rolling game with several different ways of collecting points and takes only about an hour to play.  The downside is that it's not very interactive, as little I do will affect other players.  I would compare this very favorably to Roll Through the Ages.

Jó kis kockadobálgatós, városépítős játék. Nagyon hasonlít a roll through the agesre. Nem is igazán értem, hogy miért van akörül ekkora hype, miközben ezt szinte senki sem ismeri. Jópofa ötlet, hogy mindent egy táblára kell magunknak firkálni, egyedi hangulatot ad a játéknak. Fillernek bármikor szívesen előveszem.

-> 7.2

Azért hosszabb távon bosszantó tud lenni ez az csak egyfélét lehet aktiválni mechanizmus. Úgy érzem túl nagy az előnye annak, aki 3-4 egyformákat tud folyamatosan hazavinni. Ezen felül a falépítési kényszert is túl erősnek érzem. Két főnél még opció esetleg ignorálni a falakat, ha úgy jön ki a lépés, de többen már egyszerűen létszükség, hogy legyen elég. A pénzzel be lehet szorulni, erre szerintem jó lenne egy olyan mechanizmus, ami bármikor ad egy pénzt egy kiértékelés helyett.

Yahtzee meets something lighter-than-but-similar-to Agricola.  This is a bad combination.  Player interaction only involves influencing the game pace; otherwise, it's solitaire.  The dry erase marker sounds like a better idea than it really is.

So the use of dry-erase pens is not a gimmick; it really does leave the option space open for city building. Unfortunately, it seems like the rules cut that space back down. Crates go here, jugglers go there, see who rolls the best.

If I played again I might experiment with the strategy of intentionally bringing pirates around, which none of us realized was an option into most of the way through my one play. But I don't expect to play again.

For people who like Yahtzee. I liked it more than "To Court The King" or "Through the Ages Dice", but it's still nothing great.

It's fun, but a bit too long for what it is and offers enough different strategies to try out. As it lacks player interaction and takes longer than it should, I would only recommend it as a 2 player game.

This game is similar to Ra the Dice Game, Roll Through The Ages, and other "Yahtzee"-style games, where you can re-roll dice up to 2 times.  Different from Ra or Roll, you can re-roll any dice (even the bad "crossed swords" dice).  You can even pay 2 gold coins to change a die to whatever result you want ($2/die changed), but not to or from the swords result.

It's a little bit of a geography/layout-planning game.  You want to build goods crates in a group so a Merchant (or Merchants) can be placed in the middle of them to get the maximum coin benefit.  Ditto for churches and Priests, and different person types and Jugglers.  And when you place houses (from Architects) and crates, you have to place them in orthogonal clumps, so you need to plan to leave orthogonal holes for them -- especially if you're trying to end the game in a hurry.

If there are lots of swords rolled, you want to build walls to get maximum defense rather than use those wall spots for other pieces (people/crates/houses/churches).

There are several ways of earning points -- church chains, Nobles and Jugglers, Architects being the main ones.

There is also a minor resource-collection aspect to the game, with gold coins allowing die-changing (which can be critical) and lumber collection, and lumber worth 1 VP each but can be used to turn into 3-point houses (with the Architect).

It might be an interesting strategy to build as many goods crates (and walls?) as possible to force the end of the game before too many pirate attacks (and before other players have a chance to collect big chains of churches).  crates could lead to lots of gold, which could help change dice to make 7-point Nobles, for example, or more crates...

I like playing with fewer players; 3 players (and presumably 2?) bring out less pirate attacks, so you can spend more time working on points rather than just on defence.

This is a simple dice rolling game along the lines of Roll Through the Ages where everyone has a dry erase board where they are writing the various things they acquire or lose throughout the game.  If there are too many players then there is too much downtime.  This is meant to be faster game that plays in about 45 mins.

A Village szerzőinek játéka. Kockadobálós városépítő játék. 5 db kockával háromszor dobhatunk. A dobásnak megfelelő jeleket rajzoljuk le a táblára. 

A kockákon lehet fej (1 fej polgár-1 pont, 2 fej katona-1 védelem vagy pap-2 pont templomonként, 3 fej kereskedő-pénz kincseládánként építész - fáért épület, 4 fej zsonglőr -pontok emberekért, 5 fej - nemes-7 pont) Kőért falat építhetünk, fát berakodhatjuk és később az épülethez felhasználhatjuk, keresztért templomot építhetünk, ládáért kincses ládát rajzolhatunk. A kardok negatív dolgok, növeli a kalózokat, amely, ha meghatározott mértéket ér el, megtámadnak minden várost. Ha valaki nem tudja megvédeni a városát (fal vagy katona segítségével) le kell húznia egy ágyút, ami -5 pont.
A játék addig tart, míg a tábla valakinek be nem telik. 

A kockadobások miatt, ez egy könnyed, filler játék. A letörölhető táblák és a filctoll jó megoldás, ezért nem lett volna érdemes tokenekkel telerakni a játékot.

Yahtzee style dice rolling game with a pasted on theme about building a city and defending against pirates. The whole draw on the board with dry erase pen is a smart gimmick at the time its published I'm sure, but its now outdated and many games having done that. It's an OK game with some interesting decisions as with all Yahtzee games but doesn't offer a lot beyond that.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (June 2015)

I bought the game without knowing it was a light dice game, I only knew it was from Inka and Markus brand and I love Village. After reading the rules it seemed like a good game, however I made the mistake of playing it with 5 players and it was very boring, the downtime was way too long for such a simple game. I think it is best with 3 players.

The decision are obvious (most of the time) so the longer the game, the less I enjoy it. If its duration was around 20 minutes, the rating would be higher. Lots un uncontrollable luck.

Saint Malo comes with very little components, during gameplay you will draw all of them. Drawing on the board is a novel idea, but at the end it fails to really excite me, the initial enthusiasm waned quickly. I also dislike that the boards get stained quickly even if you wipe them after finishing the game. 

The pirates are a good idea and the best Saint Malo has to offer, at least they offer some tension and/or decision making.

Bottom line, at first I really enjoyed the game but I got bored very quickly. It is way too simple for my current tastes, there is no way to mitigate bad luck rolls and it is way too long for what it offers. I think it can be a good familiar game. I already sold my copy. I think that if I play it again the rating will go down.

Current Rating: 5.0

2014-10-29 - I've only played it once, but here's a dice game I actually really enjoyed. I'm not usually a big fan of the yahtzee mechanism in games, but this one really works well. I think it helps that you can only do one thing per turn, instead of doing everything you roll. This one little change adds choices to the game that you don't usually get in a dice game. On top of that, there are multiple possible point strategies, which make those choices even more interesting.

2017-11-06 - I've played this a few times now. I still think it's a really good game, but it's not great at 2 players, so I doubt I'll ever pick it up.

Fortress Yatzee. Initial rating 8. Was really fun with 4 players, had more interaction through the pirates than first appears, especially if you play them to your advantage. Another players minus 5 is worth more than a plus 1 VP for yourself after all. Like the drawing and builing of your little fortress, has just enough strategy to not feel totally random and yet doesnt feel very heavy (moved very fast with no AP). Would be a good family game for a gamer family, for a non gamer family there might be too many things going on? 

Was fun! Recommended

I don't like drawing on the board. It's annoying and I would prefer tokens. More bothersome is the play time. The game is far too long for what it offers. It is a light push your luck die game which has more depth than a lot of other games in this genre. If the playing time was around 30-45 minutes it would be still be in my collection. We often had games go over an hour. There are much better games for that length of time.

Saint Malo is a one-trick pony. Once the luster comes off from the gimmicky drawing of a city, resources and points on player boards, there's a too complex dice game left with not enough influence. Rolling more dice with the same symbol is simply better, nothing to mitigate it. Don't get the symbol you need and you will suffer. Roll Through The Ages provides more depth and influence with the same complexity, Vegas from the same Alea series provides similar influence with more fun and less overhead.

[comment after 1 play]

The gimmick in this game (or in an effort to save cardboard) was that instead of little tokens to indicate buildings, people, resources, etc. you draw on your board with a dry erase marker. It is a simple yahtzee like game where you throw 3 times, but there are a lot of different ways of scoring.

It was interesting and fun, but I have the nagging feeling that it is a light game designed for non-gamers, but with so many different little rules that the non-gamers won't like it.

Well, this is - again - one of those games which tries to make Yatzee a bit better way. Forget to play it with 4 or 5 players, it just takes longer but didn't offer any better experience. With 3 this is okay, but nothing special. If you've played for example Roll Through the Ages, then you know quite well what to expect BUT I think RTtA makes things more better way. So nothing new or unique here which why it falls to the category of "ready to play for sure, but I'm not the one who suggest to play it". Oh, And I'm surprised that they made this game like this... it could be easily made in the "normal way" with tiles & wooden cubes etc.

After Vegas, this new medium box Alea game is still rather simple (it is 2/10 on the Alea complexity scale), even though it's one of the more complex dice games, somewhere close to Ra: The Dice Game and Roll Through the Ages - this time with spatial aspect (which I prefer in games). It's fun to have a "multiple ways to win" and "you can't go for everything" type Euro based on the simple "roll, freeze, possibly reroll, freeze, possibly reroll" Yahtzee idea. Also it's as thematic as it can get with the theme being... well, the construction of a medieval city (not very novel), with churches, buildings, wares, different personalities, use of different resources (logs and coins) and pirate attacks (the only real way for some interaction in the game). I quite like the game with 2 or 3 players as it can get too long with more, but I feel it just has low replayability value.

Downgraded from 6->4. There are much better Yahtzee variants out there at this point and this one feels like it goes too long.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

I enjoy this game but there is a bit too much downtime with five.  I'd recommend with 3-4 and this might play well with just two as well.  Roll dice up to three times and choose between five different types of actions from the die faces.  The sixth die face are pirates gathering who will attack and cause negative points if you aren't well defended.  Not sure if there is enough penalty or not for losing battles as I lost three of five battles in my game and still won fairly easily.  There are some interesting interactions between the different people roles in the game in particular.  Not sure if the boards will stand up to repeated use by the dry erase markers or not.  This is pretty light fare - don't be expecting a challenging, thinking type of game...this is much more of a filler.

Light fun, not much more.

**********

There is slightly more strategy involved than I had originally thought.  Going for goods (orange) allows you to rush the endgame, which might be beneficial if other players are working on sets of churches.  Intentionally keeping swords/pirates is to your advantage if you have enough points to defend while other players don't.  Causing other players to lose five points per battle is actually quite important.

I cannot imagine playing with more than 3 players as it will take too long for what is essentially a filler.

RATING: 7
This is a pretty neat roll and write game, where you are working to fill out your board both quickly and efficiently. You are managing money and timber, adding characters, buildings, walls, etc to your board. How you go about it depends both on how well you roll as well as how well you manage your money as you can always pay to improve your roll if you need to. It doesn't take long to play and I can imagine it would work really well on the go as you only need the dice, a board for each player and markers. Nothing else.

A nice roll & draw-game. I wish it played a bit faster and was a bit less "wait for your turn" with the interaction.

Still, not a bad game.

Enjoyable game that doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. This is essentially Yahtzee with a little bit of interaction by way of the pirates. I do feel like the pirates can be very punishing, especially with less players, but the rest of the game is fairly solitaire. The drawing aspect is fun, and I'll admit that I enjoy playing, but I'm not sure there's much replay value here. Plus I don't know that it differentiates itself from Yahtzee enough to be much of a standout game. Despite that, I do think Saint Malo is a fun game, if a bit simple.

We played it so wrong the first time, not re-rolling crossed swords. (We also forgot to pay for lumber delivery). The real version is so much better, but seems to suffer from being the same game over and over. What, you're not going to put a merchant in c3? Also, enjoy all the ink stains on the side of your fist. Surprisingly, downtime wasn't too much of a problem, but this game is very much Yahtzee transposed to a game board so the decisions are not as hard as, say, Alien Frontiers with all the expansions.

RATING: 5.5
----- Preliminary thoughts -----

It's similar to Roll Through the Ages in mechanics, but a bit more limited and longer. Can be fun to play to with 3 players, but more would lengthen the game adding nothing in return.

Luck driven (it's a dice game!) and very light.

L'originalità maggiore in questo gioco sono i materiali, ovvero la mancanza di cubetti, asticelle, miniature, puzzilli o meeple. In Saint Malo le risorse, i personaggi e gli edifici dovranno essere disegnati sulla propria plancia, ma non stiamo parlando di un grezzo foglio di carta ma di un eccellente cartoncino plastificato che permette di cancellare e ridisegnare le risorse stoccate o gli edifici costruiti. Le dinamiche invece non sono altrettanto originali, ci troviamo di fronte ad uno Yahtzee con tentativo, riuscito, di ambientazione. Un gioco semplice e immediato che vi restituirà delle belle dita nere...

I don't know what it was, but something in this really struck a chord with me. Perhaps it's the swift but skullduggerous gameplay. Perhaps it's the possibility for almost limitless house-made expansions. Perhaps it's just the fun of drawing little willies on my board with a drywipe pen. Who knows? But one thing's certain, this one deserves its table time.

[b]Saint Malo[/b] was sold via auction 4/20/15.
Received in a math trade (2/7/15)

[i]I have to admit I had high hopes for this game and was utterly disappointed. To sum it up this game ends up feeling very scripted. If pirates are rolled early you have no choice but to focus on walls and soldiers or you will get hammered with negative points. 

I ended up feeling like the decision space was very limited and even though you could flip dice you can't flip pirates and the people symbol is on the other side. Therefore you need to roll people naturally to do all the cool stuff and we all spent countless turns trying to get 3 to 4 people in order to build merchants, architects and jugglers.

We gave it 3 plays and each successive play was less and less interesting, therefore I will be trading this one away. There were some great ideas in the game, but in the end it felt like it was on rails, definitely not interested in playing again.[/i]

Actually a game I would like. Good quality boards (thicker than the playermats in previous alea-games), easy to learn and fun to play. But: the pens are an issue for me. Tje idea is something new. Anyway, I´ve played the game twice with my kids (7, 10) and all of us (me included) had black hands afterwards. As I wrote in previous comments: I think cardboard-tiles (and maybe figures for the persons)would have been better imho.

A fun and strategic dice game, with some similarities to mosaix. Build buildings, castle walls or citizens of different types to create your city...all using a dry erase board and marker.

An overlong dice game. Each turn you roll 5 dice, two re-rolls, pick one symbol and place the result on your city board. Each symbol allows different types of scores which will build over the game, so within one turn you want as many of any one symbol as you can get, and over the game you generally want as many of that same one type of symbol as you can get. So the re-roll question each turn is whether to go with the flow (stick with the symbol you've rolled most of up front and try for more, even if it's not the symbol that you'd like and will earn most points from) or try and force it, re-rolling all for the symbol you'd really like. And that's the crux of the game, over and over, for 60 minutes. Which provides plenty of opportunity to chat about the weather as you play, and that about sums it up. Interesting enough exploring the different VP strategies in place (defense, houses, churches, ...), but it needed to provide something more than the standard re-roll decision to hold me for that length of time.

An ok game. It is somewhat neat drawing on the board. However, the pirates don't really add much tension to the game and the strategy is fairly straight forward. Most of the game feels like you are just going through the motions. It goes too long for what it is.

Interesting use of the basic mechanics from Yahtzee. Plays well, but the choice of components are far from perfect. I'd prefered wooden pieces insead of drawing on the board. The pens are really really poor, since they are whetwipe and very messy. It's not possible to wipe the boards of with a dry cloth. Since the inc doesn't really stick and dry up you smear it a lot. It sticks too your hands very well though.

Only another "thematized" Yathzee/Yams. The game is repetitive with a very few suspense and interaction between players. In a nutshell : quite boring. You would have much more fun playing a real Yathzee. Moreover, Saint-Malo, the historical city of so many famous French navigators, like the explorer Jacques Cartier or the privateer Surcouf, definitely deserved to inspire a much better game.

This is another game in the recent explosion of Yahtzee variants, like Roll Through the Ages and Ra: The Dice Game.  The gimmick of this one is that you have a dry-erase player board that's a grid, and depending on what you roll, you can draw various things in your grid.  There's a spatial element, as certain drawings score better next to other drawings.  As you might imagine, this is a light filler.  Myself, I'm pretty tired of playing Yahtzee.

Recent acquisition; the mechanic combination sounded attractive.  While I know Alea puts it as fairly light, I find that it has great tactical choices and there is a small mount of longterm planning you can do (it's sort of a risk management vs cost).

RATING: 6
The mechanics are pleasing.

Interaction is extremely low -- the mutual attack by pirates + pacing pressure are the only interaction, and they are very close to just being pseudo-random number generation for parallel solitaire games.

I wish the economy were a bit more interconnected -- many faces only matter for one thing, meaning they are unlucky 'dead' rolls if you are not pursuing that path.  I wish more faces were like the person-face, which offer choices and different benefits for different strategies.  The multiple paths seems to be very balanced, but not very interactive with each other (or with other players).

The dry-erase board is a gimmick that is unnecessary -- simple wooden or cardboard bits would be superior, less messy, and longer lasting.

It is ultimately a fancy version of Yahtzee. Fun in a solitaire kind of way, but too long (and complex!) for what it is, and it dragged on way too long with 5 players. The only apparent interaction is in the choice of whether to accelerate or decelerate the arrival of pirates.

Dry erase markers on the board seemed weird to me, like they were just saving costs by not giving you the various physical bits which would normally come in a game like this.

Very good art though! Everyone I played with seemed sincerely pleased with the art.

No player interaction. Dull. Cannon pirate attacks don't really work - especially if you're the last player in a five player game. Downtime is annoying with nothing to keep you interested when it's not your turn. Marker pens help bring the cost of the game down, but leave your fingers smudged with ink. (Strange that everyone has to wash their hands before moving along to the next game.) Nations the Dice game is far superior for a dice roller. CV too.

I can see the foundation for a decent game there, but it needs a fair bit of development to get it there. Something to inject a bit of player interaction and involvement off turn would be the first thing I'd work on.

Like most dice games, this is very tactical as every turn offers roll by roll decisions about what to keep. However, the way building the city works requires advanced planning. This also creates a good mix of skill and luck. Players need certain dice to roll, but there is skill in balancing everything that needs to be done and waiting for the right dice to come along. Sadly the replayability is not there and this game feels worn out after a few plays.

A decent filler game that incorporates an erasable marker to "build" and populate a city based on dice rolling. Tends to get repetitive unless a player breaks from the usual script and decides to populate with people and jugglers, or walls and pirates to sabotage the other players. Although there are multiple paths to victory, most games tend towards the same herd mentality of "build Walls and Churches" or generate "Merchant, Wood, Architects and Houses". Games get a little too "Samey".

I liked this. It's definitely Yahtzee-esque, in that you roll a set of 5 dice up to three times on your turn, but what makes it interesting is that you've got effectively a tile-placement aspect to what you choose with the dice rolls. It's definitely fun to decide not only what dice to keep, but where to use the result that you get. The only issue that I had in our play is that we rolled a bunch of pirates quickly and it rapidly removed the defensive element of the pirates out of the game. I think it might be better if there were another pirate or two at each of the levels, but overall, this was a fun title.

While Saint Malo is perhaps the best attempt at a strategic Yahtzee variant since Roll Through the Ages, it falls far short. The novelty is that players write on personal boards with erasable markers, drawing little houses, churches, walls and so on. Architects build houses which give points, soldiers and walls defend against pirates, etc. The spatial element -- for example, priests score points for adjacent churches on the grid -- adds an interesting wrinkle, but the lack of anything resembling engine-building makes all decisions brutally dependent on dice. 

The erasable markers would be a step up from Roll Through the Ages' notepads if they were used in at all the same way, but as it is they feel more like an attempt at avoiding the cost of tokens or wooden pieces.

Downtime is excessive with more players; on the plus side, there is no interaction whatsoever so there is no reason to even try with more than two.

After a few plays the limited strategy becomes apparent. The markers aren't the greatest, very hard to rub completely. The residue makes future markings inconsistent. 

It is a fun, easy-going week day type game that allows conversation. I also like dice games like this that offer ways to mitigate unwanted rolls.

A solid little dice game notable mainly for the wipe-off player boards on which you draw the buildings you construct.

Yhatzee-style game, but one that I enjoy. Drawing is kinda fun too.

RATING: 5
There's a little bit of game here, careful placement to build opportunities, pushing others over the pirate precipice when you're well defended, but ultimately there's only enough interest for the first third of this really-too-long dice fest. Should have been developed with less chrome, and to be shorter.

First Impression:

An enjoyable dice game with a development twist.

The game is simple yet manages to provide a sense of accomplishment for the players. There is also enough variety to keep games from being similar. It is enjoyable and the drawing part is interesting for new players.

On the downside, I disliked drawing my resources and building, and I much prefer actual illustrated components compared to the mess I draw. I also dislike the luck of the dice, as despite the standard yanzee manipulation it is extremelly difficult to make any meaninfull decision that can carry through the luck. There is also significant downtime for a game as light as this.

This game is far from terrible, but at the same time doesn't really shine. It is simply a slightly above average gateway game that can still irritate a lot of people with its dice.

In terms of mechanics and depth of choice, Saint Malo is similar to Roll Through The Ages. It feels less dry (partly because of the pirates who lend themselves to some pretty mean play), however, so I prefer this one. The boards provided with the game are of excellent quality, and the markers are good enough for the job. Too bad it takes a little bit longer than it should with just two players - so I would not want to play it with more than three.
UPDATE: Played a few times more (with two) and like it better now. Seems the first play of this is generally a learning game.

This game is a hit on family holidays. The Yathzee-style dice throwing is easily explained, and the unique writeable board always sells the game to new players by itself. Fun little game to take with you on holidays.

I like this game and it is worth owning even if you like Roll Through the Ages.  I might like RTtA more, but this is a nice change with a few different mechanics.

No probably about it; it's a bit underrated. [i]Scratch Roll Through The Ages off my wish list[/i]. Done. We cheat a little and use "real" coins, "wood" cubes and a Start Player "disk" - speeds it up a little, especially with more players = Saves a little wear on the pens, (and black hands) too. It's fun!

Great for what it is.  I like it better than Roll Thru the Ages and King of Tokyo. Light and breezy, but I don't feel like I'm just passing the time.  Interesting that nobody talks about this game.

very light and fast resource management based on a yatzee dice rolling mechanic.

[+] fast paced, easy to teach, I find it clever to replace tons of small components my erasable markers!

Biggest problem: Too long with 4-5 players for what it is.
Almost zero player interaction.
City is too big - I can build everything in one game, so replayability is low.

Otherwise pretty cool concept.

Mixing a perfect information genre with dice and a fiddly dry erase marker board does not a good game make.

A neat dice-rolling game. Nicely themed and like the spatial element of being able to build/draw on your own board and have your own score track. Not much by way of player interaction but still fun.  

Edit: enjoy this at 2 as much as at a higher player count. Have only played it at 2 and 3 but it's almost a solitaire game. There is just less downtime at 2.

Pensavo anche di meno, invece il gioco è molto carino, per essere un gioco basato quasi esclusivamente sui dadi qui ci sono varie strategie da perseguire e comunque bisogna semmpre andattare il proprio gioco alla fortuna dei lanci. Molte strate per far punti.

Another simple Yahtzee variant to city build with personal dry erase boards being mindful of defenses for the Catan-like advancing pirates.  Good beer and pretzels camping game and works well as a high-score solo variant (dummy player rolls 3 dice once for a pirate check).

Very good game being some sort of a mix in between "Roll Through the Age" and "Puerto Rico". A game where you must roll the dice and then build your city. Don't forget to protect it from the pirates, and build houses to make points. You'll also won't forget to use some help from the people and install them comfortably inside the walls of your city. A little bit of this and a little bit of that; that's what makes you're city the place to live!

Another one for the pile of games that I wanted to like, but just couldn't live up to it. Those sables are SO BRUTAL! In the game I played each player rolled 2 of them on average each turn. That fills up the pirate attack track in no time: it was full before half of the game was even done. It also made it extremely hard to roll 5 faces or 5 churches, because each side has 6 different sides anyway, making it very difficult to roll something specific. You had to be very lucky to get 3 of the same symbol, and that's unfortunate. I wish something was done about those sables, like something that you could do with them, or the possibility to change their side, because now they're too disrupting and thus frustrating.

Neat take on the Roll Through the Ages inspired, dice-rolling, yahtzee, pencil-it-in.  I might like this better than RTtA.  The town building aspect is fun, and more engaging that the wonder building of the latter.

6.0 after 1 play

Gameplay is rather dry and draggy. The first part revolves around avoiding attacks and the second half is a race for points. Quite repetitive after a while. A novel approach to game components, but it did leave lots of stains on our hands.

Saint Malo should have been released at the Nürnberg fair earlier this year, but it was delayed because Alea/Ravensburger couldn’t find the right kind of erasable pencil. The managed to publish the game at Spiel in Essen. We saw it for the first time there, and it looked like people where having fun with this one. Setting up the game could be done in less then a minute. During their turn a player rolls their dice, and split up their dice in symbols they want to use and which not. The dice they won’t use, they may re-roll again. They can roll their dice, for a maximum of three times. After that, they have to use the result of one symbol on the dice. The result that’s chosen, will be drawn onto a free spot on the players board. Some small rules a player has to deal with:

    A player doesn’t have to use all the results of the dice
    The result of the dice, may not be split up
    A player has to draw a a free spot. Once a spot is used, it can’t be changed
    Walls can only be drawn at the outer ring (dark grey spots).

The game ends, when a player has his board filled. The other players can finish a turn, until all players have played the same amount of turns.

Most innovative about this game, is the drawing onto the board. Some people will love it, other won’t. I guess, the both of us, belongs to the last category. The concept of this very light and simple Alea game, is nice. Nothing special, but an entertaining family game. But this game would be so much more fun, with the typical Euro-style wooden cubes. Maybe, in a couple a years, there will be an anniversary edition, which provides some nice elements.

An excellent dice game and one that surprised me with its excellence. I'm surprised this game gets as little buzz as it does, seeing as to how it feels like the Euro version of King of Tokyo and that game is on the tip of everyone's tongue. I suppose a boring cover and theme really do make a massive difference. In any case, I'm very happy I discovered this one and it will stay in my collection.

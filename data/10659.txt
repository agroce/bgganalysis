GAME: Hex Hex
RANK: 4940
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
The "Hex Hex" card is pretty awesome, and this game's best aspect. The curses are fun, too. Besides these cards, the game is fairly simple randomness.

The Hex Hex card is so awesome, I think it would be fun to incorporate something like it into other games.

Arcane hot potato! Pretend that it's a fireball! :8

RATING: 5
Not the kind of game I enjoy. I don't like the theme at all, the "voice" for hit points just delays things. It gets far too hectic with several hexes bouncing around the table. It's founded on card drawing luck for certain. This is a game that can't get off the table fast enough for me. Having said all that, I'd still play if the room demanded it - which it does at times.

RATING: 7
Not a bad take-that card game. It'll take a game or two to get all of the cards in your head so you are not sitting there reading cards while the game goes on around you. Neat dexterity element similar to Spoons thrown in to mix things up a bit.

RATING: 6.2
Fun little party-ish game that works great with the right crowd.  I think the HexHex! card takes away from the game with a big group, and should be removed (or reduced frequency).

RATING: 3.5
Belongs in the genre of more shuffling than playing games, and near the bottom of that. Players get tons of cards, which then cease to be useful as soon as someone zaps the hex. The game becomes moderately more playable when you start with two hexes in play.

This game is more fun the more often you play.  Pace is really important to this game, though, so if you play with group who is slow to pick it up or goes through AP, then they won't see why it's fun, and probably won't get to that point where it's really fun.

RATING: 3
extremely light hot potato game along the lines of fluxx with a static goal: don't get burned by the hex that is being passed.  easy to learn, and the initially concerning amount of card text ends up being a non-issue.  my group had little interest in playing, and wanted the game to end almost as soon as it started.  the hex hex card that forces people to drop their hand and put their arms over their head is a fun wrinkle, but that's about all it's got going for it in my book.  it's unlikely that i'll play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Simply terrible. A card game where you spend more time shuffling than playing. You want to avoid the hex, unless you don't. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Hex Hex is fun, but I've been losing a little interest over time. The game has so many random cards that it's hard to play strategically. You could try to develop a strategy, only to have the hex explode on you, or for the player you hit to reverse the damage, or for everyone to just throw their cards down and put their hands over their head.

Three plays.

Requires a group that doesn't mind turning the brain off. Pure "take that" without too much control. Rounds can end very quickly, but usually not.

RATING: 5
Not a brilliant game, but really great at the niche it serves: sort of low-mental-effort quick party game.

It's in that same category with Fluxx. Slightly harder to explain the rules at first, slightly harder to keep track of game state during complicated splits and other plays, but pretty straightforward all the same.

Scorekeeping with tiny lightweight chits is completely obnoxious, better components for scores would be essential if this game were to get more plays from our group.

An overly complicated game of Goofy Ball.  The Hex Hex card is the only enjoyable thing about the game.  Justin won, and his rule is that you only have to play one round of the next Hex Hex game before it's over... to stop the pain early.

I say 'Hex Hex' - great fun party card game. Don't understand the low ratings as this isn't supposed to be a serious card game and much better played when the group is a little tipsy! For gawds sake it's a card game and by its nature is random! doh!

Light, fast, fluffy, tit-for-tat hot-potato game with a couple mildly fiddly (the scoring markers are silly as is the "throw the hex" mechanics.  However there's actually some room for both tactical and strategic thinking in Hex Hex -- more than you'd expect for such a beer-and-pretzels game.  The comparison to Fluxx is unwarranted as the card distribution is simple and fairly predictable.  While a very different game, the depth is similar to Great Dalmuti.  (Oh, and be careful dealing: the cards have no surface texture, making misdeals easy)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Knowing what cards are out there is pretty much essential to having fun with this one, so don't expect much your first few plays.  Reminded me of a combination of Lunch Money and Hot Potato.  Not to be taken seriously, but there is fun to be had.  Fun when playing fast and furious and talking lots of trash.  :)

Greeaaattt Game! Love throwing pogs around at people and making enemies. Seriously though, you have to play with a lot of boisterous players who can keep the game moving fast (first few games were a slow go with people not familiar with the cards so the ban card was useless for those not in the know ( ban that darn "Maddening Compulsion" I never have enough left/right cards to keep from getting hexed). Definately a come back for more to get B**CH SLAPPED game.

This was really fun with a large group of players, and I am generally not a fan of party games. The cards are simple enough that very little explanation is actually required. 

Can suffer a bit from one player getting picked on and there needs to be someway to track the round you are on especially when the hex has been split multiple times.

Wizards lobbing spells at each other - nice.  This is a very interactive game full of spite and malevolence.

The take-that card game in its pure form.  The theme is awesome and there are some good ideas here, particularly regarding the different cards that do a million different unpredictable things when passing around this hot potato.  However, there are a couple real problems with the game--the gang-up-on-the-loser mechanic and the very high degree of randomness inherent in being forced to play all your cards.  (1 play)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Hex Hex is a great light hearted "Take that" game. It plays quick and is great fun. The resolution of round can get a bit fiddly when multiple hexes are in play though. Ironically it plays better if you remove the signature Hex Hex card. It basically just skips a round, meaning less actual game. Also do not play with people that have tendency to look to exploit rules. The creation of rules at the end of games leaves it very open to abuse. 

The reason for the low rating due to the praise is the release of Hex Hex XL, which streamlines the game a lot! Get that instead
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fun game with the right people. Once the Hexes start splitting and such it's fun.  And after playing a few rounds where people can start making their own rules - becomes a blast. Could easily become a drinking game!

I've only rated two other games at ten, and rating this one as high surprises even me.  However, the replayability of this game is astounding.  Even after repeated (and I mean, REPEATED), plays it remains just as fresh, at least so far.  Making up new rules when you win a round only adds to the fun (making someone with negative Voice unable to speak is the current favorite).  In my group everyone agrees that this is the best new (and new means that WE haven't played it before), game that we've discovered this year.

UPDATE - Too any games can kill your liking of this game.  It remains fun (better with the expansion), but I'll usually try to avoid playing unless it's been a few months.

Initial play: During the game day, I went outside for a bit, and then walked in, and my gaming table had just set up this game, so I jumped in without knowing much about the rules  But picked it up pretty much straight away.  Not sure about the different colour hexes though.  Maybe that's the amount of damage.  
This is a fun little game, I think this is what [thing=34843][/thing] should have been.  This played quickly, way faster that Wizard's Gambit.  Hmmm...maybe if I own this, this would Jones out Wizard's Gambit...although the idea of casting Hexes on people doesn't really click with me :)

Wow, played a game in about fifteen minutes, some hands going three cards for all four players.  I won but it was pretty hollow.

This game gets better with additional plays. Early on it can be frustrating that you get dealt some interesting cards but do not get to play them but this means that you get to know what sort of cards are in the deck without them coming into play too often. The rarity that some useful cards are able to be played makes those cards all the more impressive when they do get played.

A fine little time-killer, fun to do with a big crowd of people. A little fussy and a little vague, whatever, it's not a super-serious game or anything. Fun to make people throw their drinks by waiting to yell "Hex Hex" (everyone puts their hands over their heads) just when someone picks up their beer.

In effect a party game for gamers, passing the bomb (aka the hex) around. Everytime the bomb's with you, you need to play a card to move it on to someone else. If you can't because you've run out of cards or your cards don't allow you to move it on, then you score negative points and whoever passed the bomb to you scores positive points. The cards allow all sorts of things, like creating second bombs, increasing the points being played for and the like, which means people need to read and understand them, making it non-party like, the first strike against it. The strike against it being fun for gamers is it's just too random - you either get targeted or not, and you get a chance to make the last hit, or not, at the whim of the cards people can play. The bomb going off is generally anti-climactic - it just happens when people declare it happens, unlike the fun of a mechanical bomb say. Play was fast enough for those who got into the swing of it and had easy cards, but in the end it's just too random and doesn't offer enough cheer for much repeat play.

RATING: 3
OK, but didn't really grab the attention of my family.  I'd mainly bought Hex Hex as a non-gamer's game they could pick up and play.  But even for that crowd the element of luck is just too strong.  You literally have "the hand you were dealt" and that dictates what you can do.

I don't want this game, but I'd probably play it anytime. Fun quick game. Different mechanics make it interesting. Gotta stay on top of things. Perfect for a filler.

I hate the scoring card & marker. With people slapping cards down and throwing hands into air (hex hex)-this had a tendency to seriously disrupt the score markers. Obviously, no thought on the part of the creators/playtesters went into that decision.

It needs a score slider-like the character cards or doom track from Betrayal at House on the Hill.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Good concept, bad execution.  I really like the idea of a hex flying back and forth everywhere, and the art on the cards was pretty cool.  But the game was completely random, very "take-that", and had a pick on the loser problem.  Wasn't a big fan of timing issues involved in "play whenever you want" cards either.

I liked this one but my regular gaming group didn't dig it. I just played a six player game yesterday and it was great. This is a game that benefits from more players. I think them calling it a 3-6 player game is a little wrong; sure, it works with three, but it doesn't start to get good until 4.

RATING: 5.5
Very random filler, probably more fun very very late at night. You're dealt a new hand of cards each round. Starting player throws a Hex at someone, who plays a card to deflect it (or otherwise modify it) to someone else. Continue till it hits someone -- they lose VP, last person to deflect it gains VP. Play until some target VP, or until you're sick of the game.

Works OK, but very random. Light fun.

RATING: 7
It's a fun and unique card game. The abstract art for the cards is excellent (gold symbols on a black field), and there's even some sly humor, strategy, and chaos.

My favorite rule is about adding your own rules (within reason) to the game while you play.

This game is just too fiddly to work as a real-time game. It mostly comes down to luck anyways, which just makes the whole experience feel like a chore.

RATING: 5
Only one play so far, but it seemed sorta odd. I liked some mechanics, but turning your hand back in after every hex resolves just seems like a waste of time/effort. Just drawing back up to 5 cards each would improve the experience for me. I'm willing to give it another go, but do not have high hopes for this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love this game. Then again, I love any game where the intention is to completely target and screw people over. Luckily, in this game, nobody holds a grudge... after the game's over, that is.

Best part is that you can make your own rule for the game, so no two games will ever be quite the same (assuming you have creative players).

[Smirk & Dagger Games v1.5 2005 edition] {Beer&Pretzels; utility-card; optimal 5-6p} Hex Hex is a very nice take-that game. It is hectic, fast and fun.  Random, tactical and no strategy but it's very fun.  Threats, table talks, wince, etc. appear in the table!  Recommended for players who like Uno.  A minus is that the English barrier is strong, which makes it not very accessible.

The illustration is a little bit dark.  The card stock is a thin for my taste.  It would be more friendly is a more colorful illustration is used.

This is an excellent attempt for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

Cute game, but rather rough on first-time players.  There's one card that lets you bluff all subsequent cards that you play, but if you've never played before you can't really use it effectively since you don't know what all cards are in the deck.  Plays quickly and not a bad little game.

Excellent card game. Fresh concept, a lot of fun, and quite addictive. Cards of the highest quality paper, although I wanted to see more color/images on the cards. But the hex symbols look too cool from another point of view as well. The game is very simple, but those game lawyers that need a definite answer to all situations that may arise in a game should dowload the latest FAQ file. For a card game, it worth the money to buy.

Sure, it's a chaotic "take that" game, but quite a good example of the genre, with what I thought were some rather creative ideas. Not always the most clearly-stated rules, though, which hurts a game that needs a fast pace.

Got this at Origins 04, thanks to the nice coupon from the folks at Cheeseweasel card cases.  It's alot like Fluxx, but with a mean streak.  It's fast, fun, and chaotic, and we were laughing at the end.

Update: One difference from Fluxx that keeps this game in the box is that Fluxx is self describing and can come out at a whim without having to check the rules.  This game requires a rules check and doesn't come out because of it.

RATING: 5
First play - 6 players. Basically a card game version of "hot potato". Everyone gets 5 cards and a hex is placed in front of one player. If you have the hex in front of you, you have to play a card to get rid of it. The cards are mostly comprised of "pass left" and "pass right", etc and some cards have special abilities that may make the hex stronger or cause mayhem during play. As you would expect with this game it usually comes down to the play of one card at the very end to determine who the winner is and that was exactly what happend during the seven (seven!) rounds of play we had with 6 players. The good thing about this game is that the deck is only reshuffled after all the cards are dealt so you won't see many of th emore powerful cards once or twice a game and at 5 cards per round per player you only have to shuffle it once. Also 5 cards get played pretty quickly so the rounds are pretty quick.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This is a card game that forces a Hex token around the table between players. In this respect, it's sort of a game of Hot Potato. Whoever can't get rid of the Hex token by using his cards "blows up," thus losing points.

THIS IS A LOT OF FUN!  I thoroughly enjoy card games and this has to be my absolute favorite!

The game play is excellent!  It is smooth, exciting and a lot of fun.  Players of all ages always have a blast playing this!  It is meant more for adults, but I cannot see any reason why a child wouldn't enjoy it.

The alchemy/sigil theme works very well and is even implemented in game events.  Oddly, the theme doesn't feel tacked-on whatsoever which is a plus.

Now you will not learn anything about alchemy/sigils, so to speak, because the symbols are more used for visual appeal, but they do carry on the theme.

This is definitely a screw-your-neighbor card game, so if you like that, I can confidently say that you will love this!

There is some luck invovled and not much planning can be executed, but it is all about using your resources to your advantage.  

Excellent game components!  I cannot praise them enough for making very durable cards and chits.  Sure, some will complain that the cards are too thick and prevent you from shuffling the deck like traditional playing cards, but who wants to excessively wear down the cards like that?!?!  Most gamers preserve their games well and these cards fit that bill.

Smirk & Dagger Games did an excellent job with this!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
Fun, quasi-random, chaotic game.  The interaction feels like that of Falling, but without the real-time play.  Plus, the game feels a bit more polished, and better engages the players than Falling.  (Sorry, James!)  The pace can be fairly slow while you learn it, but it's kind of a delightful, controlled randomness.

Perhaps the best part is that the rules suggest that the winner of the one of a series of games creates (or cancels) a custom rule for the rest of the series.  This can be helpful if, as it happened in our first game, Deception was played four times, one of which was the first turn.  (Deception seems to be a good mode to play once you are familiar with the cards, and can effectively lie about what you're playing.)  Our first-game winner decreed that Deception was no longer part of the game.  Yes, a game that encourages you to tweak the rules for obnoxiousness, or for taste!  Woo!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A fun and very quick playing filler game. The rules are extremely light, so this should be easy to introduce to non-gamers.

There's a very limited actual game element here though.

This game is better, if theme and story is your 'thing'. 
The 'best' part is the planning phase. But you probably won't be stressed at all, even at the hardest level.
The only real difference in the scenarios are the story, which changes, but gameplay is sameish. And the endgame phase is a terrible bad design. :/

Played at Essen 2016.

This game looks so beautiful, has very nice components and a good idea. So what is wrong with it.

Well it is all exterior and no interior. The 12 minute time limit for setting orders is there to mask the fact that the mechanic is extremely simplistic. Have enough tokens to finish a task. Added on it is the uncertanty of drawing some cards and later rolling some dice. So besides planning there is a lot of luck involved. It is still a nice game to play mostly because of the visuals but after you realize there are only three missions and there is no replayability what so ever, no matter what the authors say, paying some 50 euros for it is a no go.

Would without a problem play all three scenarios if asked (even though I would get bored after the initial 12 minute move planning phase) but would never buy it.

Interesting mechanics and theme, but much too random with the dice rolling, particularly at the ending "show down" that makes or breaks the whole game. You could be doing well in the whole game but lose because you rolled badkNeeds to be house-ruled for it to have any stability. Very random in its difficulty with two players (even with ally cards).

Strong narrative gameplay that drives tense mechanics played in 3 phases: Space Alert style real time planning, then a character & unique personality story phase, then (after repeating the first two phases a 2nd time), a final showdown. All this, told in a cohesive single horror story set in Victorian England.

I have doubts about this game.

Not just the artwork's depiction of its two female character's which feels like a significant mistake when the market for thematic games is not just teenage boys anymore.

The 12 minute action planning stage is heart of the game and is a great idea.  

I have no problem with luck elements but prefer the game to hide these from me  while I enjoy the ride.  Turning the cards over to find the plot cards is an important luck element.  If you need to turn over a lot of cards the game will be difficult or perhaps impossible and equally if you are lucky and get the plot cards early the game will be more in your control.  Even before you start planning  your actions the game has significantly telegraphed your chances of winning.  If this was a computer game you might reset the start to make for a more enjoyable experience but the resetting takes time.

When you get to the final encounter all the surviving character will throw a number of dice to decide their success or failure.  These are accumulated through skilled play and I have no problem with that (good dice rolling and lucky card play will help along the way). However after all of the luck and skill required to get to this point, with a chance of wining, I do not think that it will please the players that the end of the game is simply another dice roll. 

Do hunt out the FAQ for this game there is a least one omission. 

At the heart of this game, is a great idea, programing your actions is fun and the twelve minutes time limit focuses the players. This idea could result in a great game this however is at best and average game.

This is a fun programming co-op game which seems like a bit odd at 1st.
But this works well. It looks nice.
I like the story-telling aspect a lot.
Sadly there are some drawbacks. One is the 'real' gameplay is 12 minutes long (per chapter so can be 24). After this you basically are watching a movie when you occasionally throw some dice. And this movie part is longer than usually in other programming games.
Also there are not so much difference between characters.
Finally I think the replay-ability is not so high.
Still good and got my recommendation.

Timed co-op action programming. I like that, and how solved things cascade into helping you solve further things... though not especially predictably. I'm not certain whether I like the push-your-luck dynamic where blowing too much of your help deck during play shoots you in the foot for endgame.

The most horrifying thing about this horror game is its sorry excuse for a rulebook. Rules are missing, unclear, hidden in sidebars and examples, and printed in a really tiny font. Also, the entire game literally comes down to a single dice roll at the end (unless you lose prior to the endgame). Your actions to that point modify how many successes you need and how many dice you roll (with a 1/3 chance of a success on each).

That said, it is kinda clever and fun. Kinda. I enjoyed the planning phase, and it doesn't take forever. Worth a try, but be prepared to fill in those rule holes as you go.

Several printing errors make the game seem amateur.  Rules are terrible and a bit ambiguous. Planning phase is OK but the story phase is practically candyland once the plan is setup.  Big roll at the end is very unsatisfying. Maybe will play it if folks want a coop that is not pandemic or xcom to change things up but not that great!

Cool idea, Jack the Ripper meets Cthulhu (without Cthulhu which is nice as that theme is a bit overused at the moment). Everything is exciting right up to the ending which is a it of a letdown to be honest. Score x hits with y dice. Should be possible to make it more engaging.

Too much complexity for my taste. Five game phases: seeding the board with cards, programming moves like Space Alert, symbol matching to defeat obstacles like Shadowrun: Crossfire, challenges with an entertaining push your luck element, and a final dice roll to defeat the bad guy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The game mechanics are overly complex. Too many rules, too many exceptions to those rules, and way too many components and cards to sort out. It took more than an hour just to set up the game the first time, and we were referring back to the manual several times throughout play. I like "big" games, but in my opinion the gameplay of London Dread could have been just as interesting with fewer rules. 

Several aspects of the game seem designed to frustrate newcomers. After planning out all your moves in 12 minutes in the first phase, you move to the second phase to execute those moves. Players who have misunderstood a game mechanic, failed to pick up on the proper strategy, or run out of time will be forced to live with these decisions for the rest of the game, with no chance to correct their poor choices. Final victory is determined by a dice roll, and while you can get extra dice by doing well, blind luck still has a good chance of ruining the entire experience.

All of this complexity makes it hard to enjoy the story, which isn't well told anyways. There's a lot of flavor text to establish the theme and setting, but the actual plot is very vague and cliche.  By the time we reached the antagonist I didn't know or care why our characters suddenly decided to perform an arcane ritual.

I like the action programming aspect of the game and the symbol matching for successes is simple and quick, the symbols could perhaps have been a little clearer or the colours more defined but that is an aside. This action programming suffers from the same issues as space alert in that you usually have one of two players who feel they need to rush around and participate in EVERYTHING, 

You are trying to find plot cards (5-6 randomly shuffled into 24 cards) by randomly turning over cards placed on the different areas of the board.  If you find them quickly the game usually progresses well , but if you do not then it is a bit of a mad scramble to find them and have the time to action them. 
I also note in the two games we played we only had 2 cards not turned over (of 24) in both games which makes me wonder if they should all just turn face up anyway?

Game end is a really disappointing single die roll with the entirety of the end game an individual 'how many dice can I get' type mechanic whereby individually you have three challenges,  success adds a die to your pool. More often that not your require an many if not more successes than the die you have available. This is supposed to add tension but just feels kind of deflating.

Overall I do enjoy and the addition of character specific special abilities and very different theme make this feel different enough from space alert, although I think I do prefer space alert

A streamlined and more cohesive version of eldritch horror. I like that there is a cohesive story woven throughout the game. The planning phase with the time limit works well and is one of the most entertaining parts of the game.

An exciting and imaginative game of movement programming, resource management and risk in Victorian London. It is very immersive, racing against the clock to plan your investigations. The subsequent movement execution phase really feels like a story playing out. Superb artwork, decent re-playability (although story based, the plot twists etc don’t materially impact re-plays) and I’d happily buy an expansion. A couple of minor component niggles (e.g. standees are beautiful but cardboard fraying) and not a game I always feel like playing as the action is pretty intense. Nonetheless, a great game when I’m in the mood, with several highly memorable sessions enjoyed.

My wife and I thought this game looked cool and bought it.  I watched a couple of rules videos to figure out how to play(ish).  But then as we were starting to set it up, my wife's enthusiasm clearly dissipated when she realized the two women characters in the game were a choice between "a nun or no pants."

Since we play games to have a good time, we ended up not playing, and I'm not sure if we ever will.  So this looks like a waste of $60 for us.

Nevertheless, I did think that the design and artwork were promising enough that I would look over future games from these folks (although I would pay more attention to reviews/forums before forking over $).  The combination of different mechanics that the game offers is especially impressive.

RATING: 7
So far we have only played 2-player, which incorporates different rules than for the 4-player game.
My initial rating was an 8, but after several plays I had to reduce it to a 7. This is a tough game, which is expected and enjoyed in a co-op. However, this game just has too much compounding randomness and it can take 98% of an entire game only to fail miserably at the last minute. The final die roll allows a maximum of 16 D6 with 2 successes and 4 failures. There are few items available to mitigate this final roll. In a very good game you might have to roll 6 successes and on a tough one you might have to roll 8 or 9. We played 6 times in succession and never rolled better than 4 successes even with rerolls of half or more of the failed dice. One time we rolled only 1 success on 23 dice! This may just be terrible luck, but this is a long game to be completely at the mercy of the dice at the last second. The mechanic of facing challenges to win dice for the final battle is intriguing, but ultimately is not very successful as a game design. Very frustrating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This was intriguing. I love [thing=38453]Space Alert[/thing] which is another fully cooperative real-time game. In both games you plan your actions in real time, and then reset and execute them. You need to coordinate with other players and also trust them to take care of their own shit.

Being a Space Alert junky may have clouded my experience a bit. I've played that game 125 times. London Dread was not challenging enough, although we didn't play a hard scenario. I'm assuming that the game can be made challenging enough to be interesting.

My biggest reservation is the element of luck in the dice. The boss battle at the end of a scenario comes down to die rolls, which seems completely silly to me. 

These are just first impressions, I want to play it a couple more times. A friend picked it up so I should have a chance to figure out what I think of this game.

Played at Spiel 2016. I thought it was a nice game. Nice artwork. Interesting game play.   Only donwside is the 12 minute time limit in the first phase. This really ticked two of my friends off. I don't know if it's something from the game or just for Spiel to make things quicker. But I think it gives a negative feeling to the first phase. There will always be one person that takes the lead in setting the times and paths and a person who thinks slower who won't be able to help. I highly recommend throwing the whole 12 minute time limit out if you are playing with people who don't react well this time limits in general.

RATING: N/A
London Dread is a co-operative game set in Victorian England. Players take on the role of investigators trying to uncover plots on the way to confronting a story specific finale.

The game is gritty and thematic, featuring a series of dark events and story lines (such as the appearance of a caped killer on the streets of London) with a hint of the supernatural.

The game is broken into a series of stories, usually played over the course of 2 chapters, in which players alternately participate in a timed planning phase where various obstacles and plots are uncovered and then an untimed story phase where players resolve the effects of their planning.

The result is a tense and truly cooperative experience where players must work together, communicate well, plan effectively, and use the strengths of their investigators in an attempt to stay a step ahead on the mean streets of the city.

I had a really great experience with this at a convention, and I eagerly awaited getting the game home and trying out the other scenarios with my gaming group, but this one hit with the audible "thunk" of a cadaver. There are some interesting mechanics in the game for sure (something completely new in the programmed movement genre), and the package is really well done with nice graphics and functional graphic design. What isn't present is something that makes the game come alive apart from the mechanics. I loved the theme, I loved the setup, and I loved how it integrated the app into the gameplay. They should have had the app out for ios when the game went on sale for the first time anywhere. Instead I still haven't downloaded it and haven't gotten the game back to the table. I am pretty sure everything this game does [gameid=205637] and [gameid=205059] do better.

Another almost instabuy, London Dread is Space Alert meets Arkham Horror in an explosion of tense, fast paced thematic activity.

Most of this game is just fantastic- good theme, really nice artwork and overall atmosphere. But the really frustrating part of the game is that once you get through the strategic planning and story phase, you start the endgame, that's basically 80% luck and 20% dependent on your actions. So this really messes up all of the good work you have done so far. I get it- even the rulebook says, that it's London Dread, not London Picnic, but for me it's absurd that I have to work so hard to eventually find that I'm not winning because of some silly dice-rolling. I'm both loving and hating that game.

RATING: 6
A deeply flawed, but ultimately very fun, Lovecraftian-style game. This game feels very similar in theme to Arkham Horror, but the game play is closer to Shadowrun: Crossfire, where you are going up against obstacles that you have to match icons to in order to overcome them. Being that these games are two of my favorites, London Dread scores pretty highly with me. The real time element is very tense as well, but isn't stressful enough to scare people away since you're not forced to commit to actions you're programmed to take.

That all being said, there are some very big drawbacks that hold the game from being rated much higher. First off, this is a game where the dice are highly influential. The final showdown can also come down to a pass or fail roll of the dice, though to be fair, you have some control over how difficult the final showdown ends up being. This does involve flipping cards up randomly, but again, you do have some control over this.

London Dread is also a game that should thrive on its theme, but it really doesn't. The theme is presented in an almost paper-thin way, and I wish there was just a little more suspense and intrigue going on. What flavor text there is barely tells anything, and this is all based on me using the app. Without the app, I fear this game's theme wouldn't be prevalent enough to make the game enjoyable.

The worst aspect to London Dread, however, by far, is the rule book. I won't go so far as to say the game is unplayable, but there are certainly some rules that are very unclear. The personality deck and Confidence Cards, in particular, are very confusing. Some encounters have you utilizing them, and others don't. Some components seem superfluous also, and I almost wonder if the rule book just doesn't mention their use. 

So while Grey Fox still needs to work on writing better rule books, I have to say that they have something very interesting and unique with London Dread. It combines a lot of aspects of games I like into a single package, and while it is very rough around the edges, I think the good ultimately outweighs the bad. I'll be looking forward to exploring the rest of the scenarios this game comes with.

UPDATE: The lack of variety between scenarios along with the abstract symbols started to wear on me after awhile. Sold.

See how this game is enjoyable, but I have only played it as a two player game and find that mode lacking.  Hoping a 4 player game fixes the issues I have, including a finish where the game boils down to a single die roll.

Great components, but the game basically asks you to match animal symbol to animal symbol. This mechanism detracts from the plot which is itself quite weak. I felt that all the illustration -visual narrative- on the cards was wasted. Lack of replayability makes matters even worse.

An intense cooperative storytelling game set in Victorian London. I thought I had fully purged the bore that is Arkham/Eldritch Horror from my shelves, but I really liked the theme and artwork for this game enough to try this genre again. In London Dread, players inhabit characters with unique traits and backstories, travelling around London, fighting thugs, interviewing witnesses, and solving mysteries. The game is a decks-ploration like T.I.M.E. Stories and it's a bit of a four-way puzzle: who is best equipped to resolve this card versus another card on the board? The game is divided into two parts: the planning and the story phase. The planning phase is timed and the story phase isn't. The twelve minute planning phase is chaos, four players all trying to find those important plot cards and solving the others. It reminded me of Chinatown; just pure negotiation and haggling. And even though there are only four stories, including the Introductory one, I can see how there is replayability in the game. In comparison with other cooperative/storytelling games, London Dread is easier, it runs faster and the level of involvement is much higher for all players than Eldritch or Arkham. A definite recommend for anyone. London Dread, if slowed down and enjoyed, is a thematic, well-made cooperative game.

I like the timed aspect of organising the best order to resolve cards - determining what you can do yourself, and what you need help with, and co-ordinating other players to be in the spots you need them (and vice versa) at the same numbered action (thematically, the hour you need them). Which makes for a lot of hurried co-operative discussion with no possibility of alpha direction, and the time pressure makes it tricky to determine any optimal order of resolution for each player. Do the best you can. Then, resolve all the actions you planned at your leisure and hope no mistakes were made. You earn cards and stuff, and then use it in the end game to earn dice, and - in either the biggest climax or the biggest anti-climax in gaming depending on your point of view -  you roll all the dice you earned to see if you win. Yep, it all comes down to one dice roll. Funny. You can make it a deterministic win via variant if that's your thing though. It's not a game I loved, but one I enjoyed enough to play again if others were willing, as it goes pretty fast once you know what you're doing. The suspicion is that games are going to be repetitive though given it comes down to matching your icons with icons on the board as fast as possible, repeat.

Game play was actually tense and fun. It is a co-op game with a nice puzzle feeling. I had a great time playing until the end. Essentially the end game is a single die roll to tell if we won or not. It is like so much thought went into the design of the game play and the ending was an afterthought, 'oh hey we need an ending'. Actually a game I would play again but probably won't because of that ending. Without the ending I rate it a 7.5 with the ending I have to rate it a 5. Like it was that big of a difference for me.

London Dread is like a Hot Fudge Sundae, except instead of ice cream, you get a pile of dog turds, the hot fudge is actually steaming cat vomit, and the cherry on top turns out to be Lance Armstrong's cancerous testicle.

I adore the real time communication and communal programming mechanic at work here.   An absolute stroke of genius that really makes this co-operative triage game shine.
A pity then that the meat of the game that happens after that initial spark of joy is a barely interactive luckfest.

feels pretty thematic and tense. i'm not normally a fan of real-time games, but this one includes some real clock-crunching though put into it. there's more here than a pandemic clone. possibly more thinky than Dresden Files Card Game or The Grizzled, but certainly more chaotic. there's only so much you can effect and the ending comes down to dice. i do like the hunting around, flipping cards, pressing your luck to find enough opportunities, although that counts as another tick in the chaos column. anyway, more fun than i'd expected, but not enough my cup of tea to purchase. oh, also, as far as i noticed it's more Holmes-and-Watson-y than Cthulhu-esque. if that matters to some.

По уровню атмосферы приключения и технике погружения в неё игра несколько напоминает Castaway. Сильной стороной игры является отлично проработанная сюжетная линия из 4 Историй и нестандартность основной игровой механики. К слабым сторонам отнёс бы тайминг фазы Планирования - он только для любителей реал-тайма. Игру можно отнести к категории детективной, но только по сюжетной линии - не по стандартности известных "детективных" механик.

I originally had this for trade because I'd never played it.  After a year, I finally opened it up, read the instructions and watched some how to play videos.  (A must because the instructions aren't complete.  Go onto Grey Fox website and/or watch Rahdo for complete instructions).  My 14 year old played it and had a lot of fun!  The story is fantastic.  I can understand people not liking the whole dice rolling at the end, but you need to do well in the game to get the dice you need to succeed at the end, so I didn't have a problem with it.  I'm going to keep this one.  It might only come out a couple times a year, but I will look forward to playing it again.  I hope there's expansions.

Favorite game of Gen Con! I'm a sucker for good co-ops so that initially intrigued me. Once I played this, though, I found that this game did a great job bringing in unique mechanics, great artwork, and a fun yet stressful programming phase that starts off the game. Overall just a blast to play!

An interesting game with some uncommon mechanics. I really like the clockboard mechanic and overall I enjoyed playing the game but I'm not sure I like that victory is based solely on a final roll of dice. I tend to prefer games that require you to complete objectives to win as opposed to relying on chance.

This has a lot of little rules to remember. For the first game we just ditched the timer altogether. It was hard enough coordinating 4 people without it. It's a pretty intense kind of game that certainly requires planning, but in the end it all comes down to the dice rolls. You can guess how that usually goes for me...

Simple yet fun co-operative game with a nice setting and components. While not perfect and definitely lighter on rules than it looks from the first glance the atmosphere can swallow you and you want to experience it again. Apart from rules and story intro and outro there are basically only symbols so it's not that English heavy for non-native speakers and the gaming group can handle the game with just one guy reading the rules and translating. ;-)

Love the art style, atmosphere, and plot. The game itself? Meh. The first twelve minute planning phase using the clock is the real meat of the game. The rest of the time spent is just checking to see how well you spent your twelve minutes planning. Lots of luck involved as well with dice rolling and card flipping from a "personality" deck.

What I like about London Dread:  I think the planning and story phases are fun.  I really like planning movement with other players and trying to find the most optimal way of clearing the board given the limitations imposed by the number tokens/arrows and your attribute traits.

What I dislike about London Dread: There's no way to modify die results.  Yes, you can take more characters with you to investigate plot cards and add extra dice to the pool of dice you will be rolling, but it's not fantastic that this is the only way you can attempt to influence your success.  I particularly dislike that this is how you attempt to defeat the endgame. The storyline also isn't great. Since you encounter most of the cards in the story phase in a random order, their flavor text needs to be pretty ambiguous.  However, this doesn't give you a sense of progression in the story at all and the narrative from the plot cards seems to get lost somewhere along the way.

Cooperative Victorian horror murder mystery with four stories.  In real time phase reveal plot, ally, and encounter cards in the four districts of London.  Simultaneously program your day to advance plot, collect allies.  Defeat encounters with single roll of a pool of dice determined by variable player traits and help from support cards.  Keep accumulating dread as low as possible for the final showdown. Stories can be scaled to degree of difficulty.

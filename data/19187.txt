Playability suffers for portability. You need lots of counters and dice to make this game work. I am not really fond of the phase in each turn that lets players attack each other but it is the only chance for interaction unless the players share the same space. I'm not sure if I would play this again.

Quite envolving Dungeon crawler with lots of variety. Good enough stand alone game but if added on to other sets can be an epic journey. Nice artwork.

RATING: 7
A nice addition to the Dungeoneer series.  The Ice Witch and her wintry spell add a distinctive flavour.  The ways found to boost the power of encounters with high level characters are good too.  The artwork is OK, though white, light blue and grey are a bit too prevalent.

Love the Dungeoneer games. I came up with the exact same idea (only castles instead of dungeons) using cards to map out a board. Then I checked the Geek and found someone had already done it! Saved me some work though.

confusing game, rules not very helpful. Tried it a few times, but wasn't greatly impressed.

RATING: 5
Adds some pretty nice cards to the mix, with some cool powers. Also a terrain effect which is something different for this game. Only thing against it really is that there are lots of duplicates of the new cards.

As with Dragons of the Forsaken Desert, there's too many duplicate cards. Otherwise as fine a set as any.

edit: I'm really pissed off by the amount of duplicate cards. There's even a few cards that there's three copies of each! Next time I play this, I'll probably ditch the duplicates and take out half the missions and locations so it functions like one of the small-deck expansions. It wouldn't be so bad if it was just a few cards that had duplicates, but almost every card in the deck has a duplicate.
Rated lower than all the other sets because of all the duplicate cards.

This game is good, but I would rather tailor the rules because I think it could be better.

Will probably buy one more set at least - not sure after that though.

RATING: 6
The same mistake as in case of 'Dragons of the Forsaken Desert': all cards are doubled and thus the quantity of unique cards is cut in half... :-/

The monsters seem (too) tough (and 'Winterize' spell helps them on top of that) - heroes seem to die regularly being _far_ from completing 3 missions.  That's not really how the game should work... :-/  
You should be able to race/compete against each other while savouring and completing the quests, not being forced to think about nothing but survival...

Sold.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (October 2012)

Dungeoneer has a great theme and the art is pretty good but it has a lot of luck in it, more that I’m comfortable with. The dice don’t bother me as much as the luck inherent in the location/quest cards, as you are building the dungeon, they can appear in any moment and benefit a player over others giving him a win that was decided only by luck. Perhaps with some variants this could go up in my ratings. 

I will play again if I`m in the mood but this is not a game I will request often. That doesn´t stop me from wanting to buy it as I really love the theme. :D

RATING: 6
I think this set is more unbalanced than e.g. Tomb of the Lich Lord. The tendency for people to die on low levels while someone is getting way ahead because of some lucky quest draws is greater than anywhere else...
Recently a friend of mine died before the second turn reached him...
(Copied from Dragons of the Forsaken Desert - are all overworld titles that unbalanced?)

Witch Queen is ridiculously powerful.  Rules have several large holes in dealing with snow vs. snow tokens.  Played 2 player and one won merely by luck of draw getting two quests going to same location!  Plus the omnipotent on snow queen.  Owner has played three sets and considers this the worst.

It takes a while to play, and the initial explanation is not so easy, but once the rules are understood the game flows well.  It feels very much like an RP session, too. The cross-over appeal of the games is very nifty, as well.  I wish I could play it more often.

These Dungeoneer games are made for D&D players and people who like to play crap-on-your-neighbor type of games.  If you fit into one or both of these categories, then this is the game for you.

RATING: 8
The rules are complex...no, they're *beyond* complex...but once you figure them out, this is a fantastic, RPG-like dungeon crawler game with beautiful art, great atmosphere, and reliably entertaining gameplay.

Note: the game set includes ONLY the cards. To play, you'll need a few d6 and several gaming tokens.

RATING: 9.5
Another great expansion for the Dungeoneer line of questing. Play this one "solo" before combining with other sets to get the feel and flavor questing under the influence of the "Winter Spell of the Ice Witch". My favorite so far.

Introduces the Ice Witch whose spell can freeze the entire land!  This constant effect will not go away until she is defeated.

RATING: 8.25
Completely card-based dungeon romp that is always enjoyable to play. The amount of gameplay that is packed into such a small space is unbelievable (why can't more games take up so little storage space?!)

Luck-heavy but there are optional rules to help keep the balance (build map before playing, movement restrictions, etc.).

NOTE: Publisher's website has updated rules & FAQs which are definitely worth reading.

WARNING: Requires separate dice & counters (preferably red & green).

Another good stand alone/expansion for Dungeoneer. As I wrote for Dungeoneer - Dragons of the Forsaken Desert, I didn't appreciated very much the fact that too many cards are in two (or more) copies... Furthermore the game is always the same...

I really enjoyed this wilderness expansion...even more so than "Tomb". The quests have very clever effects...especially the ones that cause you to carry great flaming balls of fire across the frozen wastelands.  There's also some cool effects of the "ice" on different aspects of the game.  Because it is a "double" deck, you shouldn't have a problem with this as a stand-alone game.  Plus, I particularly liked the artwork in this one.

Dungeoneer is a card-driven "dungeon" delving role playing game where players build the map, complete quests, and accumulate glory and peril as they traverse the map.  Glory is spent by the player to gain items and abilities for their own hero, while peril is spent by their opponents to cause them to overcome traps and face monsters.  Players always know how much peril and glory they have accumulated, thus they can know how much opposition they may face.  Each game is a standalone game but they can be combined.

Realm of the Ice Witch is set in a wilderness, not a dungeon, but has map locations which can connect to a dungeon should players wish to combine games.  This game also includes a special event and "boss monster" of the Ice Witch adding another dimension to the story and play experience.

CCG-like dungeon crawl. I haven't got much time for this type of game anymore, what with the million modifiers, exceptions of exceptions and conflicting rules, typically resulting in sluggish gameplay with lotsa downtime and noisy arguments about the various effect and counter-effect of each card in any given situation.

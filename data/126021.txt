Played the first scenario in the book and to be honest it felt like combat was largely irrelevant. 

With only 6 turns to find and capture objectives the game went fairly by the numbers each grabbing one objective and fighting over the third objective. 

I say fighting but ...*shrugs* Vehicles didn't fire any shots as we kept hidden around corners hoping the opponent would leave an easy shot, on the penultimate turn both of us arrived in the objective building at the same turn and had a bit of a barney that was essentially, I roll more dice I win.

The board looks good with all the buildings once its set up but its completely impossible to actually play on as you constantly either knock buildings because they are in the way or end up removing them so you can play around them.

Incredible minis, incredible game.
Very fast paced, mobility is key, has a very different feel compared to other miniatures games.

Up to now I am reading the book and trying to build a coherent force. Many good sides to this game ! I can't decide yet which army I like best !

On the down side, the rulebook lacks examples on army building and tactical advice.

Love Epic (10mm scale) and the alternate activation turn based games so this should be one for me. The minis are amazing but I'll get the book first and see how the rules are laid out and even proxy some battles with existing minis I own.

We really like this game a lot.  

The resin models are incredible in detail (the plastic starters are not too bad either.

10mm scale works great for this style of wargame and lets the air transports actually have a function other than insertion as seen in most miniature games.  Its this combined arms function that really allows it to shine.

I think if it got a little more exposure it could easily break the glass ceiling imposed by the miniature games put out by bigger companies.  it just needs to reach that critical mass of players in an area to really take off.

I've gotten in my first game of Dropzone Commander; I liked it!  Simple epic rules set with an emphasis on... wait for it... Drop ships.

I liked the combat mechanics; eager to see more of what this title has to offer.  One of my favorite elements are the built in "countermeasures" on many of the units, which effectively limit weapon range in a way that doesn't feel lame.

The rulebook is gorgeous, and is the models are really, really beautiful.  There is a ton of detail on the models.

An amazing game, where a faction having the most powerful units isn't imbalance, it's part of the game. In DZC manoeuvring is key. If you lose the fight, but win the mission, you win the game. Each faction is not only uniquely designed (model wise) but plays very differently. The 10mm scale means that games are quick and can involve a lot of elements, while you still track the individual deaths of your soldiers. And all this in a first release, of the first edition of a game made by a one man team (admittedly a man who used to work for Spartan).

[b]Strengths:[/b]
*Very nicely produced rulebook.
*Miniatures are extremely cool-looking.
*Combat is heavily focused on mobilty (dropships, obviously), and this gives the system a unique flavour.
*Races are easy to differentiate at a glance, and have asymmetric potencies.


[b]Weaknesses:[/b]
*Expensive
*Strategy cards (bought separately) are way too swingy, and a massive wasted opportunity for more theme injection.

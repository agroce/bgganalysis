I played this a few times and while it looks really cool, and has nice pieces, it wouldn't be a game I'd get out and want to play regularly.  Now, as a game to have on the coffee table, it would be excellent.  But then so would Descent, and I like playing that!

Edición de madera, es sencillo pero entretenido. Para 2 jugadores. Colocas la catedral en medio y tines que cerrar zonas del tablero con tu color. Ambos jugadores tienen las mismas piezas de distintas formas, y es una carrera a lo puzle/tetris por ver quien cierra antes y quien coloca más piezas que el contrario.

RATING: 7
Beautiful to look at and quite a change to play.  This is one of those games that could go into the "coffee table" category, but it's really too good for just that.  Nevertheless, if you leave this out, folks will want to play.  It's kind of a 3D Tetris.  I play it every so often, but it's not really a classic even though it makes you think a fair bit.

The rules are easy to learn, their application isn't quite that simple. Nevertheless, it is a quick game (about 10-15 minutes). I am not sure at this moment if the game allows for complex strategies. It seems that everything is decided in the first few moves and the rest of the game just a consequence of what happened in the beginning.
So in a way, it is like Nine Mens Morris, only that it stops after setting the pieces. Because there is no dynamic move of pieces, the game becomes pretty static.
Nevertheless, the whole design just appeals to you to play this game.

I would like to play this game with another adult.  However, based on play with my two daughters (7 and 9), this game did not go over too well.  They seem interested if I suggest this game, but the stratgey is a bit beyond them for now.

I hear that once you know the right opening moves you are unbeatable.  Maybe I'll figure those moves out... I would prefer not to have anyone tell me so that I can enjoy this lovely game a little longer (Isn't this remarkably similar to two-player Blokus?  Maybe all it needs is a larger board and more pieces).

A great, quick, two-player game, made entirely out of wood. It's playing with blocks, and who doesn't love that? It's better than bad -- it's good!

Play many games in a row and finish out the games, even when it's obvious who the winner is. Then count each square as a point and see who gets the best total over time.

I own the Monumental Moves version of this. Pieces are made out of something that looks like stone and they are monuments from around the world. 10 because the quality is downright incredible, and my wife and I love playing this game. Very hard to find Monumental Moves version, and if you do it is insanely priced. I work at a toy store and we had one stuffed in the back still unopened. Was thinking of selling it because it is hard to find and so expensive, but I am glad I bought and opened it, and now is one of our more unique games on the shelf.

A quick, simple abstract game of territorial capture, given the gloss of a town building theme.  Playing by the rules in my Lagoon Games edition and depending on your level of play, the first player advantage is either strong or insurmountable.  Note to self: play the Tom Lehman start variant to balance things out.  Even so, I don't see a lot of depth here.

The Lagoon Games edition is very nicely produced with pieces and board all in wood.

I own the travel version in wood. That's a nice piece to have, it's easy to travel with, and it's possible to play with a whole new player or a kid without too much frustration. 
However, the game is highly tactical and if played often, you'll become a lot better at it.

RATING: 7
A territory taking game, with tight proportions.  It is fun, it is fast, and yet contains enough depth, to keep you going at it more than just a few times.  It makes for a well-rounded game night game, especially for family.  As it has very easy rules to understand, and features a neat set of well made pieces that handle well. (I have the wood crafted version).  The biggest issue with the game, is its lack of twists of surprises, and lack of reach for the stars style mastery.  One gets the feeling, while the game is tactical (as city building can be) in nature, it just won't go nearly as far as games like Chess.  And to be a top-notch 2-player strategy game, it really needs to be.

We have the polystone version. I dry-brushed with white paint one of the sets of buildings to increase contrast: it now looks and "plays" better. I consider this game to be lighter than most abstract games because of the limited buildings' shapes. It's a short and pretty time filler.

I recieved this as a Christmas present. 

It is a nice, simple game. It's very easy to learn, but its strategies can be quite deep, even if they are all variations on the same thing.

There is lots of room to screw with your opponents strategy, while advancing your own.

The components are very beautiful and the game can easily be left set up in one of its many 'solutions' on a coffee table as a centrepiece.

Regalado por Kantabricus en julio de 2010, en un día de visita a Puente Arce.
Es un abstracto para dos en el que cada jugador debe deshacerse de sus edificios colocándolos en el tablero.  Cada edificio ocupa un área diferente.. el tablero es de 10x10. Si encierra un edificio del contrario, dicho edificio es eliminado del tablero. Además, no se puede colocar edificios en áreas encerradas por el contrincante.
La partida finaliza cuando alguien coloca todos sus edificios, o ninguno de los contrincantes puede colocar ninguno. En tal caso, gana quien conserva la menor superficie de edificios en su mano.
Es una preciosidad de juego, porque las piezas realmente son espectaculares, y una vez acabado el juego, el tablero tiene un aspecto espectácular, como una ciudad medieval.

I didn't expect to like this game as much as I have found that I do.  I don't usually like abstract 2-player games with no explicit randomizers (ala Chess).  However, this game goes quite quickly, and the scope of movement is fairly dramatic, making it interesting.

RATING: 6
Great concept, super cool-looking board. I have a travel edition that uses magnetic strips on the bottoms of the pieces, but they almost immediately came off since the glue job was rather shoddy and cheaply assembled. Gameplay is uncompelling but fun, and definitely worth a few rounds before you set it aside.

(Own World Edition)

Cathedral is an inoffensive light abstract title that I own mainly because I like having it out on display (World Edition).

The actual game is a simple one of placement and enclosure using Tetris-like pieces. The idea is to surround areas with your pieces with only 1 or none of your opponent's pieces present in the area. The entire game tends to boil down to preventing one of the larger pieces from being placed.

This plays in about 5-10 minutes tops, and for what it is, it offers up a decent gaming experience. I wouldn't buy it just for the game itself, but the fact that you get the game essentially free with a display piece makes it a much better deal. 

Very non-gamer friendly.

RATING: 6
Pretty wooden abstract strategy.  The object of this game is to end the game with fewer squares of space of unplaced pieces than your opponent.  Pieces are shaped irregularly to cover a varying number of squares.  Enclosing a space may force your opponent to remove a structure and may provide the player with an area in which only she may place pieces.  This would be a pretty one to leave out on a table - if only we didn't have cats that would bat the pieces all over the house.

I have the ultra-crappy New Zealand version (looks like it was made in a high school woodshop class). I finally got around to playing this. Having first played Blokus, this clearly feels like a predecessaor to that. It has a little of the Go aspect of trying to make territory, although certainly not nearly as elegant. It excels as a quick abstract. Easily played in 15 minutes. There seems to be a bit of a 1st player advantage, but with a game this quick, you can just play twice and sum scores (remaining blocks unplayed).

Components: The wooden edition is beautiful and durable, but I'm docking it a point now that I've seen Cathedral-World, which is drop-dead gorgeous.

Experience: Only somewhat interesting, where players attempt to play all their pieces, preferably by claiming territory as their own. I can be tempted into playing this when I'm in the mood for a simple, calm game.

It's really not a fair fight; the player who places the cathedral is at a severe disadvantage. That's OK in this case. Switch the starting player, play again, and determine which non-winner fared better, a determination you cannot always make with abstracts that favor one player.

A moderately interesting abstract for two players. The version I owned was a beautiful wood version that collected a lot of dust before I owned it. If I had a coffee table (and my kids were older and wouldn't throw the pieces all over the house) I'd love to display it. But it fell victim to downsizing because I don't play it and never really wanted to.

Arguably it's broken for the second player, but it plays pretty quickly and is nice to look at.  Tear down is actually kinda fun, getting everything to fit perfectly.

Quick "tile"-placement game for two players. Each player has an identical set of buildings that he/she tries to build inside the city walls. As it is, the city isn't big enough for all the buildings, though, so clever placement is required. And of course it possible to create no-go areas for your opponent or even raze some buildings that have already been constructed. Simple rules, yet enough room for tactical decisions.

Solid and strategic.  Fun for all ages, yet deep in strategy.  Beautiful.

RATING: 7
Cathedral is quite a pleasing abstract, and the idea of having the starting Cathedral placed anywhere makes sure that no two games are exactly alike. Quick to play and it's one of those abstracts that looks pretty when you are finished.  It's a little hard to do any sort of deep thinking on how to play this solidly, though I know there are those who can win every time over a weaker player. For me, it's rather tactical at this point, trying to play in the best place possible given what I see.  Games always seem tight and although being able to remove pieces of your opponent doesn't happen often, it's a good confrontational bit to the game. Overall, a classic in abstract gaming.

Is there such a thing as a game that is too quick? There are only half a dozen significant moves. I need to play more to really get a feel for it, but I am pleased that a game that can be very attractive is also worth playing.

RATING: 8.5
Cathedral World is basically Go-lite but played with the most beautiful heavy polystone pieces.  Possibly THE most attractive coffee-table game of the lot!  Gameplay is to lay pieces to carve up the board into your own designated areas, then fill in the gaps with your buildings. Simple but utterly compelling.  Now on sale in the UK for a bargain £12-50, this is absolutely unmissable!

Juego ochentero de cuando apenas había juegos de mesa fuera de los rancios monopolis y parchises. Éste hasta fue anunciado en TV en España. Más allá de su vistosidad visual, se trata de un entretenido, sencillísimo y rápido jueguito para dos que consiste en ser capaz de colocar más piezas que el oponente en el tablero (léase ciudad medieval).

Wood versions are really nice to look at and handle during play.  Game play is also interesting enough.  First player advantage is significant, so probably best to play in rounds and alternate start player.

RATING: 7
This newer wood edition has a bit of gloss to the wood compared to the original from the 80's.  This could just be an age factor as well.  Pieces and board are probably about half size, but still nice enough to leave out on a coffee table between plays.  Fun game worth exploring for anyone who enjoys 2p abstracts.

RATING: 10
There's a lot to this game; I love it.  It has most of what I like about chess, except it plays quickly and is very easy to explain.  It still looks great sitting out on a table, and everyone's interested.  I've played a little over twenty games so far, and each opponent brings interesting new twists and strategies and has a different style of play.  This is true of a lot of games, but Cathedral really lends itself to understanding how to defeat your opponent instead of just how to play well in general.

This has stood the test of time. I bought it one Christmas as the "Familiy" game and loved it ever since.

I didn't expect much more from this beauty than looking good. But with the right enemy city builder, this game is way more fun than I thought. Creating spaces and removing "caught" enemy buildings reminds even a bit of Go. The complexity is of course limited, and so it is a great and beautiful filler or starter game for a longer evening.

RATING: 6
This neat little area control game shares aspects with GO in a smaller, quicker, and less complex venue.  It can also be used by kids just as a puzzle!  

I found this game in a high-end game shop, made of wood, and far above my price level.  When I went back later, it was sold and apparently out-of-print.  

As a nod to the original design, I made a copy of wood but had several differences.  1) my cathedral is unstained natural wood and has a spire and rounded sides unlike the other pieces.  2) My board has city walls around it.  3) I play by the rule that if anyone can surround the cathedral and capture it, they have an immediate win.  City walls can also be used to capture pieces.  While I have seen this happen only once, the threat makes placement of the cathedral a little more difficult.  

Various versions have sprung up since I built mine, including plastic (Ughh), wood, walled cities, famous monuments, etc.  Clearly the rights were sold, and the game has come back to the light.  I would encourage anyone to get this game, but try to pick an attractive one as it deserves a space where it can be seen!

You definitely have to be a person who likes puzzle games.  This is not something I would go to often.  Its more of a change of pace from the modern, high-production value board games.

Wooden version, much prefer the hard plastic version for the detail in the buildings.  Very simple two player tactical tile laying game to create areas of control.  Some similarities to Blokus.

I have an old wooden copy of this game, bartered for at an SCA event when I was younger (I traded some iron utensils my dad had made for it). I think that a good part of my enjoyment of it was that my dad and I were fairly evenly matched, making for a good game to play if I wanted a chance to win—unlike chess or backgammon, which he routinely beat me at.

It is pleasant and unassuming, and my rating is higher than perhaps it should be simply for the good memories I associate with it. Not a "gamer's game," but a good one all the same.

I went out of my way to acquire this because I knew I would always be curious about how it plays until I actually got to try it for myself. Now that I have, it's a decent but somewhat superfluous abstract game in my collection. The components are made of beautiful wood and the building pieces are hefty and satisfying to place on the board. But at the end of the day, if I want a chess-like abstract to play with somebody, I'll probably pick Hive over this.

Good filler, simple, yet requires you to be thoughtful. 
Unfortunately the dual game means you are likely to have a blow out if you do not do well in the strategy you are better at.

I was skeptical when I first read reviews of this game. It seems like a very simple version of Go. After a few games, I'm hooked. Is it simple? Yes, but it offers many opportunities for clever play.

Unfortunately the s/o doesn't like it so I cannot even remember the last time it got played.

RATING: 6
Its an interesting game. My wife and I officially played today twice. We started to play once a couple of years ago but because of her lowered vision she found the two colors difficult to differentiate. To that end we blacked out the tops of the darker buildings.

The game plays quickly, less than 10 minutes, per round. We're still played around with the initial positioning of the titular cathedral. Its definitely an interesting puzzle game. Play larger pieces first to remove them from your inventory or place smaller pieces to interrupt the flow of their gameplan.

I have the polystone version and the pieces are large, well crafted and feel really good in the hand.

This is an easy game to recommend as art or coffee table game.

This doesn't merit tons of plays, but it's lite, fun, mildly challenging, and it's made of wood. I have good spacial positional awareness, making me an unfair match. I bought it cause it looked nice. Much later I stumbled on a great deal on the polystone set (not the World edition), and find that I prefer that to the wood version. Either way, I have never lost, go figure.

RATING: 7
One for lovers of tetris and box-packing.  While the bigger version is an awesome addition to any coffee table, this one is still very pretty too and works very well for the quick game on the couch, an important sub-genre of my gaming.  A game of this almost invariably leads to a 2nd or 3rd game; deep enough to make you think a bit, quick enough to make you say "one more?"  There is certainly a satisfaction in making everything fit together.

Nice tactical two-player game without randomness (no dice, no cards), and with a nice classic design, at least if you have the version with wood pieces rather than plastic pieces.

Game summary: players take turns placing pieces from their supply until nobody can place another piece. Each player has an identical set of pieces in various shapes taking up a varying number of squares on the gameboard, and you basically get points for how much stuff your opponent hasn't been able to place at the end of the game.

Incidentally, this game is more or less a two-player-only version of the Rainer Knizia game Callisto (which supports 2-4 players).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Looks like a fun game. Gets a decent rating.
Try to get the wood version as it looks like it'll hold up better to transport and repeated plays.

Use Lehmann's starting variant: 2nd player lays a piece and the cathedral.

The game has a few things going for it:
1. It's pretty, so it stays out, ready for use.

3. There's just enough depth for some discovery.

A couple people in my family like it as an easy solitaire puzzle.

I grew up playing this game! Its a simple game for sure, but it offered up countless hours of fun. I have enjoyed teaching my kids to play it. It is a tough lesson to learn when you allow the other player to own most of the board on accident. They learn fast to get aggressive. If anything that is what I love about it, it teachs younger ones the importance of strategy over "what looks cool".

Similar to Blokus. Light strategy that plays quickly and is easy and quick to teach. Great wooden components with a nice feel in the hand. 

Object is to place all your buildings on the board, while surrounding opponents pieces for capture. This forces them to replay the piece, or have it total against them at game end. Pieces are also placed to claim territory on the board, by surrounding it with your own pieces, thus disabling your opponent from being able to place their pieces in your claimed territory. Plays in 15 minutes or less.

This was a thrift store find that I had listed as Want In Trade. After playing, I am quite happy with it.

Probably one of my all-time favorite games; I love how fast paced it is and how much strategy is packed into such a small space.  Novices can pick it up easily, and strategies are easy to self-discover.  The game is fast enough that it's easy to play five or ten rounds in a row.  However, I play it rarely becuase only a few of my friends will even tolerate it.

[Update: This originally had a rating of a 10; it's been slowly slipping since, primarily as I've been exposed to the huge variety of enjoyable German-style boardgames.  Sadly, I'm realizing that abstract tile-placement games are just not my favorite type of game; but this is still a good two-player game for those who like such things.]

A limited but enjoyable game to play once in a while. Actually, it's best to play twice in a while: the player going first is strongly favored with the initiative, which is difficult to overcome in such a short game. Totaling the score of two games, where each player gets a chance to go first, balances things nicely. I have the charming wooden pieces and board version of the game, received as a Christmas gift many years ago. [13 pairs of games]

Had this in the 80's and now I'm playing it with the kids. Unfortunately for this game if there is only 2 of us and we want an abstract we go to chess. This is a great coffee table game, and it plays quickly, but there is something of a distinct first player advantage. Looks 9 plays 6

Gioco di piazzamento e strategia molto bello. E' un astratta anche se si sforza di fare forma ai suoi pezzi ricostruendo una cittadella.

A worthwhile brain-burner (although possibly not with the longevity that the cost of OOP Lego bricks warrants!). More fun if you can be bothered to learn the names of all the buildings and take it out of the merely abstract. Better than FITS.

Further Thoughts: A nice copy of the wooden edition now. My wife preferred it to the Lego version, philistine that she is. Still, at least I've some spare bricks to start making Lego accessories for other games.

Beautiful game (especially the older wooden-bits copies like the one I have) that&#039;s quick and fun to play.  Scales well to players&#039; abilities, too - the more experienced the players, the more thinking can go into placing your pieces.  Recommended as a 10-15 minute filler, not to mention a devious way to display board games on your coffee table, hopefully to ensnare unsuspecting non-gamers!

I have the old 1st Edition wood version, 1978 Robert P. Moore New Zealand Patent 190034. A beautiful game to look at, play, and play again. We also have a copy of the plastic set that we can play with. There are so many different stratagies, that every play can be very, very different. One misunderstood rule is the capture rule. You can only capture a single piece! If two or more pieces are surrounded, they are NOT captured. Fun to play with folks of all ages.

Interesting abstract strategy game.  Sort of like Blokus, but much older.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I suspect this is mostly purchased as a coffee table centrepiece by gamers, but the area control game it provides is decent enough in its own right. It's a smaller scaled version of Blokus, using "beautiful wooden components" instead of plastic (but in similar shapes), trying to block off areas against the game walls to call your own, and trying to limit your opponent from doing the same, the objective being exactly the same, to get more of your pieces out. The feel is similar as well, except that it's a little bit more intense and thinky as it's two players only and the board is small, allowing little room for error. With only limited plays, I can't tell how deep or how much there is to it, and my usual aversion to pure no-luck abstract games kicks in a bit, but it's a game that seems worthy of more play.

I got the wooden one from a Montreal company, made in China.  Recently bought a second copy for a gift from Funagain for 31.95, pretty good price.  This is a game my eight year old could immediately beat me at and which both of us could enjoy, hence the high score.  This wood edition is very nice to put out on a shelf, reminds me of a trip to Brugge, Belgium years ago.  Highly recommended for adult play with kids.

I leave this attractive game (wooden version) set up on my desk, and since it only takes 5-10 minutes to play it's a good choice for a quick game.  My wife has a knack for capturing buildings, so I've had to be a bit more careful the last few games.

Once you start using the tactic of placing big pieces first, and because of the limited space and number of pieces to place, games tend to be the same (especially if your opponent employs the same tactic); at least Blokus has more scope of variability. Your spatial strategy flexes to what pieces your opponent plays. Dry with no tense uncertainty unless you hope your opponent doesn&#039;t see and relate to your next intended placement.

Is there any game which looks better on your coffee table? I doubt it. This game is a piece of art (and you should see Cathedral: World!).
That being said, the gameplay does have its (minor) faults. As you may probably see in the forum: unless you are very clear about the rules, it is possible for anyone to capture a huge part of the board in a very short time.

It's not one of their best, but I like it from time to time. And it's just so great to look at  ;-)
(Tip: take a picture of it when all the pieces are on the board. It makes putting them back after a game much easier)

Found it for 1 Pound at a Charity Shop in London. A very "simple" game, in terms of rules at least. I do like the game very much, I do have the wooden pieces edition and it the bits look and feel great, like chess pieces. When I played this game I noticed that players will quickly start to create strategies and try out tactics, becoming more involved in the game. The game does not work well with players of different playing strength, because there is no luck involved at all.

RATING: 3
The early game is arbitrary.  The late game is obvious.  If you are lucky, a turn or two in the middle will be interesting.  Mostly, this is just a packing problem, with some tacked on capture rules.  Better to skip it and instead play Go or Blokus.  But many of the boards are quite pretty...

update:  played like Gonnection (also insta-win if you connect any two opposite sides with your pieces) it is much better with more opportunities for clever plays, forced inefficiency, and early game heuristics.  The dual risks of connection and capture finally make the game more than just packing and AP.

as is:  3/10
with connection win condition:  6/10

Cathedral is a fun game to play to kill time on a rainy day. There's a bit of strategy involved. The problem is that games tend to be very short, and while people may not master the strategy of the game quickly, playing the same opponent over and over can lead to you both trying to always accomplish the same particular strategy before the other person does.

Cathedral is another one of those "don't be the last player with no moves remaining" kind of games. The game is go-like, in that you're trying to control an enclosed area and if you do that successfully you can force your opponent to remove one of their pieces. The game looks nice on your coffee table, and when you're done it looks like you've built a little city. So, cute, mild entertainment.

I played this a lot in my high school days when I had access to a copy of the game.  Consequently, I have wanted to pick up a copy for some time.  Unfortunately, it has not yet entered my collection.  At any rate, the game certainly appears to the part of me that likes spatial organization.  In one sense, it is almost a train game.  At any rate, back in the day, I seem to remember that we reached a point of equilibrium in our plays.  I wonder if that would hold true nearly 20 years later?  Definitely something I want to give a go.  Perhaps in the next year or so I will pick up a nice set (or build one?). [08/14/2007]

Cathedral (Family Games, Inc.) -- This wooden version arrived with some pieces broken.  The manufacturer gave the unhelpful advice to glue them back together.  Production quality is not as high as with previous manufacturers.  (Clearly mass-produced using one kind of cheap wood dyed to produce the contrasting colors, rather than using hardwoods suited to such contrast.)  Still, it is attractive.  Elegant play.

The polystone version works better as a tabletop decoration. And it's more fun to rearrange all the buildings so that they form the best skyline.
Not playing too often but I like the game.

A solid strategic 2 player game with excellent components. Don't get to break out 2 player games much but this one plays quickly and is very easy to teach. While not heavily promoted in the gaming industry, older games that offer a strategic element, are easy to teach, offer re-playability and have visually appealing components are the foundation of what a good game should be...and this one fits that bill.

Ebay buy. Nice abstract. Wifey yet to be convinced!

The Bad: Rules (territories) a little confusing... going to be tough to get to table often (wifey not a fan).

This is an excellent 2-player game that plays in 15 minutes or less. The space capturing rules (claiming areas bordered by your own pieces and the city wall) give this game a feel something akin to GO. At least my wife will play me at Cathedral.

It's a cute abstract game.  It's simple enough that it can be taught quickly, and short enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome.  But, outside of the pieces, it doesn't have much of a wow factor.

Perhaps made obsolete by Blokus.

Now THOSE are some wooden bits!  This is one fine looking abstract strategy game (so much so that it has become a center-piece on our coffee table), and it's an ideal one to turn to if you want a fairly quick, two-player strategy game, and you don't want to commit the time or the mental energy to a game of chess.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

Wooden deluxe, magnetic travel, and World editions.  The attractive bits, quick gameplay, and easy rules make this a great gateway game.  The simple rules and elegant bits make this a game I can invite non-gamers to play.  Looks great after the game, too.  Especially like how quickly you can play 2 games in a row so that players can alternate light and dark.  This is my favorite 2-player abstract.

I used to have the red box, wooden version, 1985. It was a gift from my favorite aunt, and I liked the game, to boot. Years after losing my original copy, I eBayed another, and it could be the same copy. It even has the cheesy photo of John Davidson. I heard a rumor that some wiseacres had 'solved' Cathedral, but that'll never be a problem for me. Cathedral plays quickly, and it's the only pure abstract I've ever played more than twice at a sitting.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This rating is if you use our starting variant (first player goes, then the second player places *both* a piece and the neutral Cathedral; continue alternating moves normally).

Otherwise, I rate this a 2, as a somewhat interesting puzzle.  Why?  Because there's a start sequence that trivially allows the first player to win, no matter how the Cathedral is initially placed.

I don't post this start sequence because I think players enjoy exploring the game and finding it themselves, but I will say that I was challenged at a con by a well known and accomplished Cathedral player to demonstrate it (he even offered me $100 if I could beat him; I refused his money).  I beat him 10 times running (by decent margins) and he then acknowledged that, yup, there does seem to be a problem here...

An area control game. We have the world edition so the pieces are fantastic to look at. Plays quick and you often can play a few games in a single sitting. Person who gets the most pieces on the board wins. Simple premise repeated in dozens of games. Its the actual playing pieces of this game that help it stand out.

Very classy, beautiful abstract game. The 3D pieces create the illusion that 3D placement and position is important, despite playing on a 2D field. The handful of mirrored pieces in each person's set presents simply mimicking your opponent's moves. The Cathedral positioning adds a great touch, and ensures each game is different. Wonderful game.

Cathedral isn&#039;t very interesting to me when I play with adults.  However, when I play with my toddler, this game lives up to its gorgeous components.  Simply take turns placing pieces with the goal being to fit every piece on the board.  Wow, what a challenge and a great change of pace from the usual kiddie games.

[b]GOOD ABSTRACT COFFEE-TABLE GAME.[/b]

I very much like this game. I adore the feel and weight of the wooden pieces particularly.
Played many, many games of this with a variety of opponents. It seems to appeal to most people.
Simple rules. Swift to play.
The theme is the thinnest of veneers. Cathedral is an abstract.

Once you have played a great number of games of this you really do have the edge on newcomers. It takes a few tries at Cathedral to get to grips with the fundamentals of area domination.

The Deluxe version looks frankly amazing! I'd be interested if the Wonders of the World edition came out in wood, not plastic.

I really like the classic wooden "chess piece" looking set and the area enclosure is kind of like Go with tetris pieces... But Gwen wasn't impressed by the demo we played and I'd much rather play Blokus.

Not a bad abstract at all, though there doesn't seem to be much in the way of sweeping moves or grand strategy that I'm familiar with (and a fan of) in other abstracts I enjoy.

The game feels like a strange, simplified,  QUICK version of Go. And the wooden buildings look great. Much more subtle than it seems.

After 2+ Plays: Interesting after a couple plays.  Need to play more to get a better sense of the strategy.

A great little game with the only flaw that the person who goes first should never lose.  This is why it's most optimal to play two games, alternating who goes first and compare scores.

Fun to play as a game, or as a puzzle with the kids trying to fit all the pieces back in.

A game that one buys for the looks, plays for the head-to-head challenge, and then keeps for the looks. I have the polystone edition and it is quite attractive. Gameplay is decent. The game can be very unwieldy to put away or store, so if you're hurting for shelf space, it's something to consider.

Haven't been able to play since some of the wooden pieces separated and I need to work out which bits should be reglued!

A plus of this game is how the light gameplay is in balance with the game time.

RATING: 6
Nice graphics.  Simple idea - pick up a polar bear either identical to the one in your hand or with just one difference.  Favours people who can process visual images very quickly - gets a bit grabby as everyone goes for cards and someone can end up feeling a bit fed up if they can't get in.

Dexterity pattern-matching game that comes with very good quality cards and super cute artwork on it. Not a game I'll play multiple times in a sitting but I never fail to enjoy whenever it hits the table. It probably helps that I always win this game somehow :).

A pattern recognition, speed matching game. Players simultaneously pick out bears from an array that have at least one matching aspect to the bear on the top of their stack.

Very simple rules and clean and cute artwork make this a nice little filler.

Would be happy to play again.

Don't care about those additional features. But the game is as cute as its predecessors. Won't play this much, as I prefer other games to speed games, but hey, it's cute.

If we'd stopped after playing just Pick-a-Dog, my rating could easily have ended up a 2: the game was too cramped, rounds were too short, it was clear that in every game you could have someone feeling robbed of a card grab or being the first to call end of round. Mixing in Pick-a-Pig improved things to quite tolerable. It's still not a game I would request, but I might prefer it to Set. Note that it only really works properly if everyone can be seated at equal distances from the centre of the tableau, so that if you don't have a small or circular table you should not play this with more than four. Probably the only game where part of the fun is that you get to sit and croon, "Loses an arm... gains an arm... becomes cool... loses popcorn... becomes a pig."

I'm recording identical ratings and comments for Pick-a-Polar Bear/Seal and Pick-a-Dog/Pig, since they are essentially the same game. Note that in order to get the higher rating you'd need to combine Bear with Seal and also not play either of the variants in Bear, which do not seem attractive.

Super cute "spot it" game taken to the next level. Everyone scrambles to quickly collect cards but have to be careful not to make a single mistake. Kid friendly. Easy to learn. Great gateway game.

Reverse Ligretto with even cuter illustrations and sturdy square cards. Includes some extra cards for slowing down the winner of the previous round and for an extra puzzle between rounds.

Does not directly combine with Dog and Pig as is, but if you have all six promo cards, trying with all three sets is an interesting option.

RATING: 6.5
Simpatico e immediato filler di destrezza della serie Pick-a... Lo scopo del gioco è trovare prima degli altri giocatori i cagnolini che abbiano delle somiglianze con quello in possesso, si continua a prendere dei cani fino a quando non si reputa che non si possa più andare avanti. Appena la mano finisce si valuta chi ha preso più carte cane e si fanno punti se non si sono commessi errori, se no si perde tutta la mano. Un gioco semplicissimo ma divertente. Le partite durano 5'.

This is a fun, simple game that provides a rapid pace. Players simply grab cards that either match or are one difference off their current card and then add that card to their pile. Then the process repeats until someone ends the round. We use the word, "Freeze!" based on the polar bear theme. Everyone then checks their cards in the open, which is half the fun when a player realizes they messed up on the first card!

規則:
*將所有牌洗混後，翻開30張在桌面上排成5行，每行6張為[隊友卡]，每人發一張卡蓋著當做[隊長卡] 
*所有玩家一起同時翻開自己的[隊長卡]，以單手在[隊友卡]中找與 [隊長卡]只有一樣不同或完全相同的疊在隊長卡上，再以新隊友卡繼續尋找桌面上的[隊友卡]，直到有玩家認為桌上已沒有自己的隊友時便可以立即喊出：「到齊！」所有玩家必須立即停止並進入檢查卡牌階段。
 *先檢查喊出：「到齊！」的玩家卡牌，確認桌上沒隊友，在檢查其他人
>若是，則該玩家可從桌上再選取一張加到自己的「計分牌疊」，不是第一的則不會多抽
>若發現桌面上還有此玩家的[隊友卡]，則此回合他所有選取的[隊長卡]及 [隊友卡]皆放置棄牌堆，此回合沒有分數。
 *新回合開始時，每位玩家再抽一張[隊長卡] ，並將桌上的[隊友卡]補齊至30張。若沒有足夠的卡牌填補，玩家便利用剩下的卡牌完成最後一個回合。最後「計分牌疊」中每一張算一分，被棄置的牌不計分；分數最高的為贏家。
1.北極熊額外在遊戲準備步驟中放入+2分的牌，排出10張之後出現+2分的牌時即停止排放並將+2分的牌翻面，所有玩家立刻觀察在所有隊友牌中出現+2分圖案的有幾張?先喊出且正確的玩家獲得+2分的牌；喊錯的給一張-2分的牌。
2.每一回合的贏家必需獲得「≠」的牌，表示此玩家在下一回合中不能找完全相同的隊友，所以他只能找只有一樣不同的隊友；這樣就可以減弱他的戰力了呢

- but that twist is not fun...
- can't mix with Dog or Pig

It's a very simple derivative of Ligretto or Dutch Blitz. Which for adults is rather an activity but a game. For Kids you might call it "Memory Advanced - The fast edition". So yes, there might be educational value in here - but I just don't like this

As a party game, it fell flat with everyone I played it with. The setup of each round takes LONGER than the round itself, and the mechaninc is also somewhat hard to grasp for unexperienced gamers. A real downer.

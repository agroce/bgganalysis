GAME: Campaign Commander Volume I: Roads to Stalingrad
RANK: 3929
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think there is a good game in here.  When I played the game using the rules in the rulebook, it was really fun, and I gave it an "8" rating.   But apparently, what is clearly defined in the rules (Series Rule 9.5.6) is overrode on the message board without any references to the rules (see: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/17847018#17847018).  Among these games, this has been the norm.  (Series Rule 5.2.5 also doesn't apply all of the time, even though the rules say they do: it's up to you to read the message boards to figure out when they do and do not apply).  As it stands, the rules are as arbitrary as a game of Fluxx, Calvinball or TEGWAR (The Exciting Game Without Any Rules).

I created a set of rules I made base on reading the rulebook and trying to streamline them and simplify them.  I based this on two years of experience with the game, but it turns out that I still don't know how to play this.  If you would like a copy of my alternate rules, send me a Geekmail.  Using my rules, it is a fun game to play incorrectly, and my rating reflects those rules.

Un buen diseño español de esta campaña. Buenas mecánicas de movimiento y de cartas. No así el sistema de combate con chits que llega a aburrir de monótono y a veces interminable. Además, el hecho de que las unidades raramente queden eliminadas (salvo que sean rodeadas) no me gusta.
He elaborado un sistema que quita las fichas de combate y además incorpora un sistema para poder jugar en solitario con las cartas.
Aun así el juego es ameno y original.

Had my first game after a quick walkthrough of the rules in 10mins.

Pretty good game with in depth strategy for both the Germans and the Russian player.

Good mix of board action and card interaction.

This first game did see a sweeping action that is reasonably dynamic for both players. In this case, it does mimic the flow and ebb on the Eastern Front.

Need further playing to enjoy the full flavour of the the game.

RATING: 8
Deep game with  tons of difficult decissions.  Simple rules in comparison to other wargames but not simplistic at all. A very torough work with lot of gaming principles on it. It deservs much more attention.

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: This Eastern Front game brings with it a number of mechanisms not normally found in other wargames. To begin with, this game has an interesting resource/supply system which simulates command and supply issues plaguing the factions in the conflict.

The heavy emphasis on cardplay makes me feel that this is a cardgame with a board. Cards act as triggers for various progressions in the game's story arc. As such, not having the right cards at the proper time can hamstring your plans. Cycling through the deck is a slow process and burning your deck will trigger the endgame. Burnt cards are normally not seen again throughout gameplay so opportunities can be missed through no fault of the players. Combat is performed with a chit-pull system which although original, can become fairly tedious after a time. 

All in all, I need to review the rules in depth before attempting to play this game again.

RATING: 7
Solo play. Really nice compact design effort for the operational scale. Nice tension created by the game-within-a-game contest of whether to bid for a map move or a card play. Resource management a nice compromise of playability and simulation. Would really like to try ftf.

I like the chit draw combat mechanic, but still getting used to the fact that a unit is difficult to destroy outright (that's my problem, not the game's). Its fun though, and more interesting than an arbitrary/sterile CRT.

Graphics are a mixed bag. The counters are big and inspired, but the color choices make them a little difficult to read. The map is functional. Production values not top notch, but good enough and certainly not a showstopper.
(The VERY nice gentlemen of Bellica kindly replaced one of my cards!)

Congrats to the designers for making a playable, yet meaningful effort out of the Stalingrad Campaign. And one with a very manageable play time footprint to boot.

I think the game is perfect, except one small detail, that ruins it.

I don't like the battles.
After 2-3 hours you are just tired to throw so many dice to solve the battles. It doesn't make much sense.
Since there are no stacking limit, to solve one battle you are there just throwing the dice. 
If there were a CRT to solve it the game would be much faster and enjoyable.

--------------------------------------------------
Very different from other games I've played.
Need a second play (now with the correct rules).

I've enjoyed it, but... need to check it with the cleared rules.

The explaining videos are awesome.

The only drawback is the inferior component quality and the lack of a player aid. The game itself is awesome!
One problem though is that large combats takes a very long time to resolve.

RATING: 3
3 feels harsh, there are a few interesting ideas here, but "probably won't play again" is where this game is, so I've got to go with it. Some good stuff, but badly underdeveloped - it really needs some sensible line-of-supply rules. But I think the real problem here is that the game comes in two halves, the German attack and the Soviet counterattack, and the second half really doesn't work - the Soviets have a hard time getting supply to the right places, and the combat system heavily favors step losses for the Germans and retreats for the Soviets, which works great in the early game, but when the Soviets are attacking they end up bouncing backwards two spaces a lot, which takes them three map actions to recover - Soviet infantry moves at the excruciating pace of one space a turn. Meanwhile the Germans are holding on with comparatively cheap step losses (given that the game's combat system heavily favors the Germans in any given battle). This makes it very hard for to gain any momentum after the Germans have peaked, and it totally kills the pace of the game.

There are other serious pacing issues as well. The combat system is very fiddly can can take minutes to resolve trivial combats, which is no good. This really needed to be a CRT or something which could have been resolved in seconds. Also, the draw decks are odd; because of the clearly two-stage nature of the battle, you can end up drawing cards badly out of order and they are hard to cycle.

Roads to Stalingrad was going in the right direction, I think it had the right ideas, but it suffers from a lack of development. There is a good game here, but it still needs a lot of work. A Victory Lost and Stalingrad Pocket both undeniably have issues, and they take a bit longer to play, but I just wouldn't play this again ahead of those games.

RATING: 7
Decent effort and very innovative.  Tedium on the combat system is a drawback, and having a key, needed card buried at the bottom of the deck can ruin your day.  Play is fairly fast.

RATING: 9
Tremendous logistic-focused  operational system that easily gives more well-known operational series a run for their money. This is a for-effect design, where the simple and effective mechanisms create plausible avenues of exploring historical alternatives. And all without needing weeks to play and miles of tables to setup. The components are not up to scratch, and the rules are badly written, but the game shines brightly through. 

An excellent wargame that deserves to be further recognized and reprinted in better component quality.

+ logistics, logistics, logistics. In particular, the retreat towards closer supply rule makes you think hard about in-depth defence
+ the game pacing feels right, once played you will understand why the Germans had to stop their advances
+ the stacking mechanism is ingenious and creates subtleties in regards to longer-term planning
+ the card playing and the chit activation mechanism is very well thought out and carries a lot of tension and bluffing potential
+ low counter density (Corps level) and low rule complexity
+ once up the learning curve, it can be easily played in 3h
+ the combat system (rightly) does not emphasize unit elimination, you need to seek maneuever and encirclement instead
+ this is a system, so once you learn it you have at least 2 more other games to try out
+ plays well solitaire, if you can disregard opponent battle chits and card hands during your decisions making 

= this is not an easy game to learn and master, expect to throwaway your first game otherwise it will last 4-5h
= the combat system can drag a bit, but this is something that I find well put together and exciting. Your mileage may vary.

- the rulebook is atrocious, seek out the corrected rulebook that a fellow geek did for the Punic War game
- the components are subpar, I had a partially unglued (!) countersheet which I asked to be replaced. 
- the map is not well printed (seek the setup file here) and river names are missing

Very innovative mechanics. It puts two issues, which do not always come across in conventional wargames, at the forefront - operational tempo and logistics. Firstly, placement of RPs and when to spend them are key drivers to this game and mastering them is key to doing well in the game. Secondly, the card/map mechanism brilliantly captures the sense of operational tempo and adds a psychological element to the game. It heightens the "reading the opponent" element which can be lost in the "counter shuffle" of traditional wargames.

So the game does work in Stalingrad. German troops thin out and attrit as they press ahead relentlessly. But they still need to pause to bring up supplies. Russians have to figure out how to get inside the operational tempo of the Germans, conduct a strategic withdrawal and contain the Germans. 

I think this is going to a very difficult game to wrap your head around, simply because it is so different from other wargames. I think that is going to be a good thing. :) Good to see a game designer take a risk on an innovative design and have it pay off. But not sure if it is "too weird" for most people...

I don't have complaints about gameplay but I have some complaints about the components of the game. The watermarks of the initial setup on the map are barely readable. I had to write up a separate set-up sheet to avoid straining my eyes. Also, the English on the cards are not as clear as they could be and the countersheet was miscut.

The first title of a very nice series. The designer tries -and manages- to offer a simple and fast wargame which can be finished in an evening, but plenty of interesting decisions and strategical options. The basic mechanics are smart, and all the components (including cards) are well integrated.

Received this game today and must say that it looks really good. Will set up the game and give it a try solo to see how this works out.

Having played the game a couple of times I can assure you this to be a very nice and innovative game. The components could be improved upon, and were in Vol. II and III, but do the job well.

My first Spanish wargame ever!  After some French (Hexasim) and Italian (Europa Simulazioni) wargames, I have general confidence in the European wargames and designs.  The counters are thinner but not thin as those S&T magazine wargames.  The rulebook appears to be a little bit disorganized without a content list or index.  The map is divided into many small areas like recent Tarleton's Quarter game. There are some 70 cards with little or primitve card art.  Not the kind of standard that we expect from those productions from France or Italy.  Map art is OK but you won't expect the kind of touches from the French.  Hopefully, the gameplay can be as good as the publisher claimed - that it was playtested well and without loopholes for players to exploit for.  After all, this is a battle about two materminds - Manstein and Zhukov.

Had a first play which turned out to be a smooth system easy to learn and a good simulation of the 1942/early 43 events. 7 hours to finish a first game with one player discovering the game from scratch.

I recommend it.

Solitaire play was interesting, but replayability solitaire may be more difficult (if you are not a real schizophrenic)

Rating after playing a few hours (the number is "turns" is unlimited, if you can believe that.)
Very unusual game. The rules are very dry and need to be reread carefully to understand their exact meaning and implications. More detailed examples of play or explanations of the rules would have been helpful. 

This game will definitely be played again.

First impressions.

A very playable, fluid game system... much more game than simulation, but might be acceptable if you're interested in an engaging game without a lot of rules overhead.

Production quality:  

Not as good as MMP, GMT, LnL.  Map graphics and paper quality is fine.  Counters are a bit thin (but comparable to GMT), look OK, but functionally are a bit hard to read due to use of white numbers with indistinct outlines.  Card quality is very good... coated stock with a nice matte finish.  Game setup is harder than it should be due to use of faded, reduced counter images on the map sheet (difficult to make out unit IDs and type).  Rules could use a better font, bolding and white space to separate important sections.  Some ambiguities... checkout the rules q&a.  Also, some player aids that should be included are not:  something to track victory points for each side, a counter track for total cards played, summary chart for combat chits.

Gameplay:

OK, but not exceptional.  Game has a fluid game system that captures the feel of the campaign.  This game is very much a wargame in the Columbia Games style (high on abstraction), but with perhaps, stronger historical flavour due to the larger card set, card events, card text and use of combat chits.  But also overly chaotic.

This is a two session game (6 hrs), at least until both players are familiar with the rules and gameplay.

RATING: 7
This is a fresh, original system that is a better game than it is a historical sim - you will need to leave some preconceptions at the door! I really like the way supply works (it is on the board and used to activate units within range then consumed), I like the fast moving impulse system also. Elimination of units can seem tough but once you get a handle on how to activate your units more efficiently it quickly makes sense. The manual isn't spot on and there are a couple of quirks (interchangable use of SP and RP for example) and things that should be clearer, but overall it is decent and I was able to understand the bulk of the game without much trouble. This is a good game and it is great to see new developers trying something different, wargaming always needs fresh perspectives and I think the designers are on the right track here. Good debut effort.

Our latest release. First Volume from our Campaign Commander Series. They are devoted to allow players to fight great campaigns from military history in a reasonable time of play (3-4 hours) with a maximum of simulation and fun.
An interactive system of play with cards and counters to allow players to make historical choices trying to upgrade historical results.

RATING: 7
Plays a bit faster and looser with history than most games of this ilk, but still manages to serve up a decent gaming experience with some novel mechanisms that I've not seen in other wargames, especially supply and combat. The cards are perhaps the weakest element as they're not as interesting or detailed as they could be and can also be prone to timing problems, as cards that cannot be played until near the end of the game could be in your starting hand. Despite my concern about the cards, this is a good, flowing Eastfront game which can be played in three hours.

9-12-16 Got this game and am looking forward to playing it, but am waiting to get into it with a few games ahead of it in the dock, and to be honest, have heard and seen nasty counter removal stories from the cardboard sprues. I tried to remove one row and immediately stopped. The chits/counters are not cut through enough and the glue holding the fronts and back on appears very lacking. Waiting until I have time to patiently sit down and trim all counters out with the proper tools. I actually got Coral Sea(Campaign Commander II) before this one and did not have an issue with those counters, so the problem appears to be relegated to the first release in the series. Very much looking forward to this game though.

Just about the worst die-cutting ever.  Wow.  Also, after one play, this game needs a Player Aid Card something fierce...
[UPDATE: Contacted Bellica via email and they are sending a new countersheet!  And I made my own PAC -- see the files.]


The designer's conceit was to create a historically plausible, quick to learn, playable, fun game of the Case Blue campaign done in a medium-length sitting.  Sounds like a cliched checklist but where many others fall down I think he's succeeded.  

Roads is pretty fun with some interesting dynamics based on the core Campaign Commander ruleset: play cards or do operations.  It does a really good job of capturing the tempo of WWII operations where your panzers lunge ahead and leave their logistical tethers behind, pause to let them catch up and lunge again.  The play and discard of cards is the only measure of "time" and it's a neat way to balance things.  I'm quite impressed with the gameplay engine overall.

I think it's a valid criticism that the combat chit system is a wee bit fiddly.  But heck, houserule it if you want.  I've played worse.

Components-wise I had heard bad things and my fears were well founded.  The countersheet in my copy was terribly cut but to Bellica's credit, they are rushing me a new one.  In the meantime I'm docking one point until it gets here.  Otherwise, the cards are fantastic and the map is excellent, except for the very faint watermarked start positions.  The rulebook could have been better formatted -- it's a mess.

This game took some warming up to.  The rulebook is a pretty rough translation with a lot of typos, inconsistent terms, and bad outlining.  When I started playing, it seemed very simple and too biased towards the Germans.  However, once the Axis took Stalingrad and the Soviets started getting reinforcements, the game became much more interesting.  In fact, each turn became more tense as the Axis tried to hold onto their points and the Soviets tried to retake territory.

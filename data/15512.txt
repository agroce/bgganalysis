Pretty fun - can play a lot of folks and takes about 15 minutes. I find it very amusing to see when people leave the cave - ie, before any hazard cards have come up; when the odds are 2/26 that the cave will collapse, etc.

Haven't played it with the artifacts, but it seems like it doesn't really need them.

This game is everything I wanted it to be: Plays in 20 minutes. Plays with up to eight players. Very few rules to explain. Takes little space to play. Very non-gamer friendly, but lovely components and rich theme. There is lots of opportunity for banter, bluffing, and pushing-your luck. An excellent work-lunch-time game, or start-of-a-games-night game.

RATING: 6
Hmm. First, this game only plays reasonably well with 4 or more people. Second, it plays at times poorly due to odd card draws - like several traps in a row for several phases of the game. Third, I still kinda like it. But only in the right mood or setting. Lots of players. Pure filler. Pass the time. There is nearly zero strategy - but bluffing is really fun if the cards come out right. So in general, luck of the draw literally makes this game shine or stink for everyone. I'd say 1 out of 2 times it plays well.

This is pretty light.  It reminded me most of Kleine Fische.  It has the same push your luck/chicken quality of that, but with a wee bit more thrown in.  It's gorgeous to look at and it's clear that it's a social game and that since it holds 8, it will be better when 5-8 are playing.
Good for playing with kids too - not a lot of difficult decisions, but what there are at least give some pause for thought.

Very good game, and the archetypal "Gateway" game. Butchering someone elses quip, its like the game was hewn from a mine as one perfect flawless gaming nugget.
Although it's tiring after a few plays, where the laws of averages catch up with you, The game executes the "push-your-luck" mechanic perfectly, without artificial supports and with a great theme. Better than Can't Stop, Cosmic Wimpout et al by a long way. The only downside is the game is quite expensive for the weight.

Honestly, this deserves a much higher rating but I just can't seem to get it to the table enough.  It has everything you could ask for:  scales up to quite a few players, plays very quickly with any crowd, and is quite fun because of the push-your-luck tension and the competition to win with the most treasure.   Despite all those great elements, I usually have to bribe my kids to play it.

- Game is complete risk and luck.


Why it's previously-owned:
While it seemed to be a perfect receipt for a push-your-luck game, it just lasted too long for what little involvement there was.  Most people got quickly bored with the game very quickly.
I traded this away for Aton.  The best game that uses the push-your-luck mechanic for us has definitely been Ninjato.

Played this (as Incan Gold) tonight -- what a pointless excuse for a game.  The only thing good I could say about it would be that you can "play" it with a whole bunch of people, but why would you bother?  It's like "blackjack" without the allure of pretending you're James Bond and the fate of the free world depends upon your playing the odds just right. Bleh.

Not bad, but falls just short of what it promises too often for me to love it.

It's fun, but often it's just best to be conservative, and that means you sit out while players stay in for far longer than they should. 

Feels like it could have been great, but instead was slick. It's not a terrible tradeoff, but I can't think of a time where I'd rather play this than something else.

RATING: 6.5
Ican gold is a game whereby players dares other players to continue venturing into a cave to find treasures before they met the dangers in the cave.  Once players back out, they are allowed to keep whatever treasures they have found so far but not allowed to go back into the cave to look for more treasures in that round.

When players met any dangers, they lose all their treasures and went back to the camping area with no treasures.

Good points: The game has simple rules and can be explained in minutes.  The game can really be fun when it is played by many.

Bad points:  It is a pity to bend the cards as instructed in the game rules.  The game must be played by a rowdy group of players or it may not bring out the flavour of the game, to dare each other to venture further and get more treasures.

Lots of fun if you don't mind chaos and high potential for imbalanced scores. Not as satisfying as other simultaneous cardplay games like the delightful Hoity Toity/Adel Verpflichtet but still good. 

I wish the "enter" and "exit" cards were more immediately distinguishable. (Hard to tell the difference across the table with a large number of people playing, especially--a red vs. green border, for example, would have helped a lot.)

RATING: 6.5
I agree with the general consensus that this is a fun filler, but you have to be in the mood for a purely luck-based game.  My kids enjoy it but find it frustrating that they can't control whether they succeed or not. Really nice gems and other components.  We prefer to play it with the board than without.

Doesn't really sound that interesting. Collect jewels and then run back or risk getting more treasure - push your luck.

We played Incan Gold with 8 players and a second game with 7 players. It was fun, but this is the kind of game that needs to have more than 3, ideally more than 5 players.

This game is great for parties. I love pulling it out when a game night needs a bit of a break, or when I have a group with some gamers and some not really gamers. I find that the speed at which it gets setup and how quick it can be explained really encourages those less interested in games to give it a try. So far everyone I have played it with has asked to play it again.

The only reason that Incan Gold is getting a 6.5 from me is because I really like it with 6+ players. And I mean, I REALLY like it. Any less than that and it becomes sort of "meh". The gambling, push your luck, aspect of this game is something that gamers and non-gamers can latch on to. This game isn't meant to be serious. Part of the fun of this game can be pushing your luck in order to get farther into the temple than one of your friends.

This has been a big hit among my game group and among my family and that is huge. I love it when a game appeals to a wide audience and this certainly hits that spot.

Incan Gold version. I was quite intrigued by this game, since I'm a major archaeology fan (Thebes, anyone?), and I really, REALLY enjoy push your luck games. And yet, I'm not in love with Incan Gold, and I'm not sure why. I'm definitely willing to play it, but it just doesn't make me want to dash off and buy it by any stretch of the imagination. Rules are super easy to catch on to, though. The card graphics (while not bad) weren't the greatest in the world.

- Great push your luck

Cons

- You need to make change a lot and that's annoying
- Sometimes it's very clear who's going to win

RATING: 9
Great for big numbers of player. Best games with groups of 8-9 to relax between harder games.
On the same level as MOW for that.

The base : when finding treasure, you always split up exactly between explorers, and any leftover is left in the room to pick on the way back. 
When finding perils, the first of each is harmless, but the second has all explorer left running back dropping all their treasure.

Very simple choice, just go on or go back.
Going on can mean more treasure, especially after other players go back the share goes up BUT you can also lose everything.
Going back mean keeping what you have already found, as well as picking up leftover gems on the way back, which can make a substantial bonus, especially if you go back alone.

Also good for non player/family

Some great thematic ideas but a bit fiddly.  Better if you divy out the jewels as you get them and only place the remainder on the cards.

I also prefer when you hold a token in your hand to indicate explore rather than using the cards.

So I'm pretty much never interested in two games of Incan Gold in a night, but it's perfect for what it is and I love it as an appetizer / dessert to heavier games -- super easy to teach, exciting, unpredictable, dripping with theme, competitive to the end, and palatable to both the more analytical and more casual in my usual gaming circle.

RATING: 7
A very simple to explain and play game with very basic rules that nevertheless manages to produce a frothy, you-are-in-the-moment hoping certain cards are turned up, kind of game.  When to withdraw from the expedition and take all the remaining jewels, hoping no one else withdraws?!

A great and easy to pick up press your luck filler for the whole family.  I purchased the Gryphon edition, and while I'm mostly satisfied with the components, I do have some issues.  

1: The insert could have been a little less tight as to allow for card sleeving and 
2: The cards to choose between running away or exploring further in should be easier to distinguish as to prevent some early game confusion (although once people get it, this problem becomes a non-issue).

I had high hopes but this game doesn't do it for me.  Maybe I play too often with too few people.  But it seems like there is a runaway leader so early in the game that you have to take big risks to catch up, and then it becomes silly.

Simple, nice filler. Creates tension when you await the next card, or wait to see whether other players stay in the mine or not. Guess what other players are going to do - otherwise the game becomes a mixture of routine and luck pretty quickly.

It has definitely made me want to explore the genre a little more.

I played this game with some of the kids at my work tonight and, as expected, it was a hit.  There is actually quite a lot going for this game as a math learning tool for young kids, mainly with division and probability.  I wavered about getting the Diamant version for a while, but decided on this version.  I think the artwork is nicer, especially the artifact cards, the gems are lackluster compared to Diamant, but it serves its purpose as an aesthetically pleasing, simple yet solid risk taking game.

RATING: 9
Good with 3 or more, to me really starts to shine with 5-8 players as it rewards pushing your luck more.  A very fun light game to play, where the conversation created during the playing is a big part of the fun.  A game which can be played and enjoyed by people of all ages.  I have played this with children aged 5-8 and find that they compete very well as they tend to be more risk adverse than some adults.  A good game to introduce non-gamers to.

When playing with my niece she is responsible for calculating how many rubies everyone gets, and what the remainder is, I mean what is left over and goes on the cards.  A pretty sneaky way to teach math.  Hope she doesn't figure it out!

I like the artifacts from the Inca Gold edition, but I like the components from the Diamant version better.  If I had to choose between the two it would be Diamant.  Holding the meeple in your hand is a lot cleaner and less confusing than having to choose correctly between 2 cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Successor to Diamant.  I like the components better in Diamant; the ore cart and the meeples.  To me holding the meeple in the hand is less confusing than trying to pick correctly which of the two cards you're supposed to use each turn.

On the other hand the inclusion of the artifact cards is a nice addition, and they do add another dimension to the game.  

I always play this game too aggressively.

This is one of my favorite games for a large group.  Essentially this is a "push your luck" gambling game.  

Players take on the role of explorers looking for treasure in an abandoned Incan temple.  At every step the players have the option of taking what they found and leaving the temple to bank safely in their tents.  The less people exploring the temple the more lucrative the expedition...but the greater the danger to lose it all.

It plays fast (frequently in about 30 minutes) and leaves everyone involved...even if it's just to root and cheer for the remainders of an expedition to meet with disaster.

Finally played this game face to face and it did not disappoint.  It was a lot of fun pushing your luck going down farther in the cave for jewels!!  It is nice and simple and can be explained in 2 minutes flat. The game is fast and gets a lot of emotion out of you.  You cheer and let go a sigh of relief as you don't encounter any dangers.  Just a lot of fun.  With only 1 game this is a very solid 8.

I will probably get this game myself soon, since it's a great quick party game that doesn't have a lot of complexity. It's a risk taking game that you have to decide if you leave the Incan Temple before your companions, or you stick it out to the end to try to snag more treasure. I would recommend this to everyone.

Very fast game.  With few players, treasure is gained by staying in just long enough.  With more players it seems, more treasure is gained by managing to exit the expidition alone.  All the games have been very enjoyable.  I really like the push-your-luck element combined with outguessing your opponents.

A classic press your luck game.  Do you travel one more region into the temple, hoping to score big?  Or do you get out while the getting's good?  Fun little theme for a quick filler game.

[i]Posted: 1/11/08, Rated: 8[/i]

I was first introduced to [i]Diamant[/i] on [url=http://www.brettspielwelt.de/?nation=en]BrettspielWelt[/url].  It felt like a big randomfest (yes, I just made up a new word, I hope you'll forgive my precocious nature), and I didn't care for it.  Part of my reaction was due to my not fully understanding the rules, even though they aren't difficult.  The good news was that it never lasted very long.  Sometimes I even won, although I didn't know how I managed to do so.

Still...the game stuck with me.  And when my sons displayed a tenacious appetite for "press your luck" games, I remembered it.  Suddenly the Indiana Jones-esque (precocious) theme wasn't corny, it was cool.  Browsing the gallery showed inviting, fun images instead of the sterile, computer-rendered ones from BSW.  I decided it might be a game worth owning after all.

It turns out that [i]Diamant[/i] is a real gem when played face-to-face.  It is an extremely easy game to teach, and provides an enjoyable, social experience.  My family immediately took to it, and we've introduced it to other families with universal success.  It is a perfect, light "filler" game, that has the added benefit of being playable by up to eight people.  Despite my initial misgivings, [i]Diamant[/i] is a diamond in the rough.

This game is just okay for me. It can end too quickly if the wrong cards come up too close together. We had one game where two snakes in a row came out, then two of the ugly girls came out in succession shortly after. Yes, we had shuffled the deck. 

I prefer Cloud 9 or Double or Nothing for fast press your luck games.

Each game has been fun, and the more the merrier for sure.  With the right group, the right cards, and the right mood this could be a classic.  I own the Incan Gold version, and couldn't imagine the game without the artifacts, though I would much prefer the little boxes from Diamant to the folded card tents in IC.

A great game for new players. Easy to explain and people have fun with it.

Great for playing with kids. Fun, simple, and has an interesting theme.

Rate it a 6 for playing with grownups (there's just a lot of other games I'd rather play), but for playing with kids, I think it goes up to an 8. So I'll just average it out to a 7.

Updated from Diamant to Incan Gold (hence the weird plays on the calendar). Incan Gold is great! A simple mechanic (push your luck) taken to amazing levels in a 20 minute game that works equally as well for any number 3 to 8 players. What else do you need really? Go buy this now!!!

My first play was with only three players and fell a little flat. I recently had a game with six and it was a riot: one player cleaned up just because the other five left the cave too early and so we were forced to take greater and greater risks to catch up. Great fun for a large group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Incan Gold is simple, easy fun. It's a "press your luck" game that seems to solve a lot of negative issues present in other similar games. The cards apply equally to everyone, so you'll always feel like you have control over whether you win or lose. It's also very interactive, since you're constantly trying to guess what everyone else is going to do. And the door is open for different sorts of strategies: for example, instead of trying to stay in the temple as long as possible, it is perfectly viable to get out early and take all the jewels yet placed on the cards.

Unfortunately, the rulebook is quite vague (especially for the artifact rules), so make sure you check the forums for clarification.

Much less fiddly than the cards supplied.

A very nice press-your-luck game that seems to captivate everyone.  The amount of howls and moans as a second hazard strikes a player is hilarious.  My family really enjoys this type of game, and the way that this one involves all players at the same time is awesome.  It's also really nice that, with enough guts and luck, players can come back from any deficit.

The one issue is that you really should play with a large group (6 to 8 players is ideal.)  With less players, one good round will often determine who wins.  You also need to have everyone within easy reach of the stones.  If one player has to pass out all the stones to all the players they will get sick of the game really quickly.  But the game works really well with players of almost any age.

Ok, so this is just a game of "chicken" ... but it's a game of chicken with a really cool theme and awesome looking pieces!  Beyond simple to explain, this is one of the better games to introduce to your non-gamer friends.  Not a game you'll want to bust out all the time, but as far as filler goes this is top-notch stuff.  (Have increased the rating.  This is just a blast to play!)  The "strategy", of course: when in doubt, press your luck!

Alas, further plays have revealed that this is only exciting if you are playing at or near the player limit.  Sometimes the game can just fall flat on its face as well.  Reduced from 8 to 6.

Equal to Diamant with worse bits.  I haven't tried the "artifacts" version yet; perhaps this saves the game with fewer players.  We'll see.  I was surprised to find out how much the bits "make" Diamant; the cheap production values take a lot of the fun out.

Nice push-your-luck game, and the fact that it scales to 8 is a big plus. Larger games (5+) have been more fun in my experience. Plays quickly, easy to explain, and novice-friendly? Welcome to the collection! (I still enjoy Cloud 9 more for 5 or 6, though.)

Also printed as "Incan Gold", this is a classic push your luck game where the only decision you need to make is whether t keep going further in the cave to discover more treasure, or to run away and garb treasures already discovered. The catch is that if you and another player leave at the same time, you must split the treasure available, and if you stay in too long, you may succumb to the dangers within. 

Simple fun, and only about 30 min, this game works with gamers and non-gamers alike, and can play a crowd to boot!

A classic game of knowing when to push your luck.  Using simple card based gameplay you either forge ahead into the mines for more treasure or you leave.

Another game whose delights are weighed down by far too much administration.  There is too much that slows down any momentum to the game play--calculating and distributing the gems, trying to discern who is staying and who is leaving as the cards in my version are nigh indistinguishable.  The psychological aspect of the game is pretty fun but I am always happy when this game gets removed from those on offer for the evening.

Thanks Secret Santa 2008!  When I opened the box I felt a bit cheated because I received a game that wasn't even on my wish list.  Then I realized it was a remake of Diamant and was fine.  Some of my boys got Indiana Jones hats and whips so the exploring theme worked.  

We played this no less than 20 times since it opened.  I didn't even bring in a single piece of loot my first three games!  The first game I died in all five temples by a different method in each.  We had a really good time and expect to for many years to come.  All of my kids, that played, LOVE this game (ages 7, 9, 10).

Thanks again Santa for such a fun game that will stay in my collection forever.

Fun light filler game for the entire family.
before you say its pure luck (and luck play a big part) keep in mind that its actually a probability game.
What is the expected value of going further, vs. cashing out now?
Ex: I have X treasures, and drawing 1 card gives me a D percentage of disaster vs. an expected Treasure value.
It also helps if you try and be aware of the other players holdings as it gives you an idea of whether you need to press your luck.

(PS - dont forget to remove a disaster card if it triggers the end of the round)

An okay push-your-luck and guess-what-everyone-is-doing game.  Best feature is that it can hold up to 8 players.  Worst feature is that it's pretty chaotic, and one good gem haul from 1 of 5 mines can win someone the game.  In the luck-pushing genre, I prefer "Circus Flohcati".

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Light filler game that can hold 8.  Slightly different from Diamant.  The golden idol cards (5 pts for the first solo miner to flee) add an interesting twist to the game.  Still, the winner of the game usually seems to be the one lucky guy who stays in the best cave the longest... or the slow & steady player that collects a couple gems per cave if all caves go sour quickly.  In the luck-pushing genre, I prefer "Circus Flohcati"

Each person gets to decide to run or push into the temple before another card is revealed. This could be treasure of different value, an artifact or a trap. Think Indiana Jones here. The fun part is deciding to keep pushing your luck or run for safety with the treasure you have collected at that point. There's only 5 rounds and these only last a few minutes each. This is another game that you can pretty much just start playing. Explaining the rules only takes a minute or two.

Classic push-your-luck game.  I wish the production value was better--the cards wear quickly, the stones are silly colors, and the tents are just stupid.  I do appreciate that the box is small, but I would have liked better cards and better screens.

Beautiful design. All cards sleeved. Prefer meeples from older edition but these are nice as well.

RATING: 5
It's a fine little filler. It basically is a press your luck game with cute components (the tents are fun). When one player squeaks out of the temple with more jewels than the other players, eliciting curses from the group, a good natured laugh is had all around. In fairness to the five, there just aren't many fillers I really enjoy. It would be fine for an after dinner family game where all can play and enjoy. It plays quickly and couldn't be easier to learn. I think there are too many other press your luck fillers I'd rather play instead, though (King of Tokyo would trump this every time for me).

Great filler.  Wish it had the production value of Diamant as the tents aren't quite as good nor is it nearly as fun to use cards to determine if you are staying or going.  Use your own tokens hidden in your hand to reveal if everybody is staying or going in the cave.

This is a neat game of simple press your luck.   Your either in, or out.   If your in, you have the opportunity for better treasure, or losing it all via some terrible event.   But if you bail out too early, other players will easily surpass your treasure.

Nice push your luck game.  There's almost nothing to it which is usually a negative.  But it works well with a lot of people and is actually better with more people since you are active all the time.  Also it's pretty quick and simple and easy to teach.  For these reasons, it's great as a true filler to take up some time until everyone shows up or until the food arrives or whatever.

This is a very good light filler.  It is a one trick pony that does its trick well, and then gets out of the way.  I was able to explain it in all of about 2 minutes.  Games take 15-30 minutes, depending on how many are at the table.  Plays well with 3, 4, and 5 - probably more as well, although the optimal amount of risk is different depending on the number of players (IMO).  A perfect 7 - I enjoy it enough to play it pretty much any time, but too light for me to suggest.  Perfect for non-gamers.  My wife's family likes it, which means it has a solid place in my collection.

Very fun push-your-luck game.  Lots of tension with simple decisions.  Some rounds are over much too quickly and other are extremely tense.  The game play changes with larger groups, which is good.  Game can also be played by a people of just about any age.

Update - The game has worn on me a bit over time.  I find I no longer enjoy it as much as I once did and some games can be really boring if the catastrophes come out too quickly.

Another Update - Back up to an 8.  I've had a lot of fun with this lately with large groups and with Brit and Ben.

RATING: 7
Leaving the traps out makes for an interesting mechanic.  It makes the later mines more tricky.  It's not as much of a "push your luck" mechanic as I thought it would be.  At a certain point, you have to stay in just to have any chance to compete (if you're losing).  This means that one is forced to stay whether it is the right tactical play or not, toward the end.

Another decent, quick filler. Pretty much a pure 'press your luck' game, with a few other minor strategic choices involved. Essentially though the only decision you make is whether to stay in a temple to get more treasure, or get out with the loot you have accumulated so far. Fun theme and components, coupled with a short playtime, made it enjoyable enough for a light filler.

RATING: 9
So, compared to the original edition of this game (Diamant) they added the "artefakt" feature, which is coll and gives a bit more depth gameplaywise, but remoded the small cool Indy-meeples, easy to understand dungeon hallways and colorfull boxes for keeping track of your treasure. Result: The game mechanics are better, but the packing lacks bigtime. Shame.
Edit: I originally rated this push-your-luck game as a "7", but after a year where it has hit the table numerous times, I will have to admit it an "9" istead. In its genre it's in THE benchmark. You just never get tired of it.

This met my every expectation - lots of fun with groans and cheers throughout.  I like how sometimes the expeditions can last a long time and it'll take 50+ points to win; other times a very low point total wins as the disasters come fast & furious.

I agree that the "stay" and "go" cards are problematic in that they are very similar.  People have a hard time telling them apart.  Other than that, components are fine and work well with the them (though my cards are quite bowed).

This will get played for years to come, I'm certain of it.

+10 plays - this is a great filler! Not surprised by how many games of this I've played because it plays so quickly and we usually play more than once when we do play it. It is a good addition to any gamers collection since it plays quickly and is great for families and non-gamers alike. Not to mention that it can accomodate up to 8 players!!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm not sure if my family and I are all mutants, but this game kind of fell flat for us after the first few plays; it does not hit the table often now.  I agree that it is good for teaching some basic math skills, such as simple division (since you have to divide jewels equally between players still in the cave).  And how many games teach kids division in a  fun way?  So that is a good thing about  the game to be sure.  However, as I said I have worries about replayability.  There's a certain sameness to each game.  Go in the cave.  Do I get out now?  No, maybe now?  Ok, now.  Then go in the cave again.  Do I go out now?  No, maybe now.  Ok, now.  Then go in the cave again.  And so on.  As far as push-your-luck games go, I prefer Cloud 9.  The theme is not as exciting, but there's more player interaction (since there is a bluffing element to that game).  Cloud 9 doesn't teach division though!  So if you are looking for a fun game with a math element, I could still recommend Incan Gold.  Otherwise I think there are better games.  Still, remember my family may be mutants and take that into consideration.

Plays:  around 10, each for 4 players (2 adults, 2 kids aged 7 and 5)

Diamant (1st edition): 8.5 Wonderful game - lots of fun and immensely replayable.  It's light and fast and the decison whether to flee or stay is usually finely balanced.  The lovely wee jewels, chunky explorer meeples and handy treasure cartons of the 'Diamant' edition make it the one to get.

Incan Gold: 7.5 Pretty much the same game as Diamant, but docked a full point for inferior presentation (no lovely jewels) and annoying component changes (why get rid of the meeples - which were such an elegant solution). While I like the maguffins in this version, others don't. If you have a choice, get Diamant instead. If you can't then this remains a good game.

Not quite as good as Diamant, but the artifacts definitely add a bit of flavor. Heather pimped ours out with some small metal tubs from a crafts store to replace the lame paper tents.  Having the tubs definitely adds to the game as everyone asks about them.  It is a little too easy to see what your neighbour has though.

I have realised that my limit to this game is 2 games in a row though.  Playing with family, others would have played it over and over, whereas I was super bored in the 3rd game!

RATING: 6
It's a good push-your-luck game that plays a lot of people, but it wasn't a hit with our group. Played on summer vacation 2017 with Patricia's cousins.

We tried in again in January 2018. The "winning" strategy seems to be to chicken out early. A lot of the players ended up with no points. Maybe as we get more plays in, everyone will fine-tune their strategies and it'll be closer.

I don't find this game as fun as a lot of other push-your-luck games - the other bluffing games or action selection games are more fun than the "should I stay or should I go?" decision.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very simple game of calculating chances versus gain. The simultaneous action selection (yes/no-choice only) makes it fast paced, the immediate pain/gain creates some suspense. 

Nice filler, if you can count.

1 play, on BSW. I had wanted to play this for a long time... and almost bought it once or twice, but I'm rather glad I didn't. I wouldn't pass up the opportunity to try it in person (I think it would be more enjoyable that way for whatever reason), and it's a decent little press-your-luck affair, but other than that I see no real reason to play again. Might make a decent filler for a large group. But there are better games that fill this niche.

Great game to pull out with a large group if you don't want to play a typical party game.  It also works well for our family of four.  I would never pay retail for it, though; it's way overpriced.  

UPDATE: I had to up the rating on this because I've noticed that we pull it out more than most other games, particularly when we are with family.  It's nice and short, so it works for everyone.

I own Sunriver Games version "Incan Gold" This is a great party filler game of push your luck. Artifacts from this version really add to the game.

The only real problem with this game can be early eliminations in the first few rounds is highly probable. This can make it hard to bring back to the table, because it leaves a bad taste in peoples mouth if it happens during their first time.

The push your luck game I have been looking for. Plays very fast, is tons of fun, and provides that great sensation that you get from gambling, without the money. Fun to see different play styles from different personalities. The gems are a little unwieldy, but otherwise nice components. I scored 0 in my first three games and had a blast.

It gets a 7 because of being a great light filler game with a huge push your luck-aspect and a game which you can play with 8 persons (thought it only really shines with 5+ in my opinion)! It's not the same "7" as for instance Alien Frontiers and Macao, which I would of course prefer to play when playing a "real", lengthier board game, but it's a good game for what it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Almost the same game as Incan Gold (but not quite due to the lack of artifacts - although these have been introduced in the new version of Diamant, so the new Diamant and Incan Gold are basically the same game). Read my comment for Incan Gold if you want to see more.

Great filler! Two minutes to teach, fifteen minutes to play. Unnecessarily large box for the few components which are very nice, by the way. Works well with kids as young as four.

This is the first push-your-luck game that I remember playing, and for a while I really fell in love with it. But eventually I got burned out on it and stopped really feeling the sense of investment that a push-your-luck game needs to be fun. But this is a simple game to teach, so I picked it up to play with family, and the newest Gryphon Games edition is really nice, especially with nicer tents than the old version that required you to crease playing cards to make the tents stand up.

Enjoyable press your luck game.

Gets better if you play with 6+ and I prefer the imported Diamant to Incan Gold because of the superior rubies and diamonds. It is easy enough to import the excellent idol rules from Incan Gold. 

Hooks non-gamers every time.

Have to raise my rating because it's just brilliant.

Incan Gold is my preferred straight-up push-your-luck game. That's not to say I want to reach for this game all the time... it's a once in a while option. But for a pure push your luck game, it's hard to think of better options. 

It's very simple to teach, with each turn a simple "stay or go" decision. Very light, very family friendly, and it's a game that is certainly better with more people. I've played this at lunch with seven people, and the result was a surprisingly raucous affair.

A great push your luck game that I wish I would have played sooner as it is so easy to teach and play to wind down a game night. I think the only thing holding me back is it definitely plays great with more and I very rarely have a full group as the bluffing about when to keep going and when to stay is fantastic. The ability to pull off big come from behind victories with the artifacts rewards risky play and that just makes this game stand out.

This is a quick and fun push-your-luck game. I'm usually not the biggest fan of push-your-luck, but I find this one playable.  My one complaint is that there's aren't enough gems; we were always trying to make change.

This game is Diamant with a little extra thrown in.  Although, you can take out those elements and play just straight Diamant.  I haven't played enough to decide whether I like the Artifacts or not.  They change the push-your-luck dynamic and add a little more chaos.  Probably better without them.

Definitely a fluffy filler with a lot of randomness and not super thinky, but I like this one. A combination of push your luck and prisoner's dilemma in equal proportions, comically easy to explain and over in time to get to something meatier (which is to say, just about anything.) Before the mania for "microgames" swept the boardgame community, there were solid, modest little timekiller games like this one, that set out to do what they intended.

Good game when I feel like a filler, but not my favorite filler. But with a lively crowd I enjoy it better.

RATING: 8
What filler should aspire to. Very fast, very easy to teach, variable enough to make you want to sit down to it anytime you have 15 minutes left over. Each turn a new card is flipped over with gems or traps / obstacles on it. If it has gems, then each player present gets a cut, with the remainder being left on the card. If it's an obstacle nothing happens until a duplicate is drawn, once the second is drawn then the expedition is over and the players who are still in the cave lose all of the gems they have collected. An additional incentive to leave is that the players who flee collect any left-over gems on the cards that have already been discovered, and in the case of relics, if they flee alone, then they get to pick up any relic cards that have been flipped as well that are worth 5-10 points depending on how many have already been collected.

The  "should I run" mechanic remind me both of Ra (for the push your luck aspect) and a myriad of bluffing games (because cutting and running is most lucrative when no one else is doing it at the same time). This is highlighted further in the later editions that add the 5 relics to the game.

One warning: this rating is reflective only of high scale games (5+), because of the way the game works it isn't nearly as good with less, so I would only get this if you actually have a group large enough to handle it. The beauty is that more players does almost nothing to increase the game length, but adds multiple areas in which players can bump heads when they go to leave the expedition.

Many printings exist, but the originals from Schmidt do not have the relics, which is a shame, as I like the original art best. From the perspective of art and functionality to value I think the current Iello edition is probably the best, as I like the square cards for this one and it also has nice little cardboard chests to hide your loot in.

So fun! I love the push your luck factor. 

I had a neighbor we played this with who kept going and kept going long after everyone else had fled to their tents. (this is a fun game condition that occurs every few plays of the game) He was able to flip cards at will and keep all the loot for himself. After 20 or more cards flipped we were all on the edge of our seats begging him to take in his epic haul but he kept trolling us with more and more flipping. Ultimately, he took in something like 60 or 70 points in one round when he chose to leave the temple with his loot. Of course, we always like to flip the next card to see what might have been...the very next card ended up being the one that would have cost him everything! It's this kind of stuff that makes Incan Gold so fun to play. To me it's a little like Yahtzee in that I can be really excited for other people when they rock it without getting too competitive or upset that I'm losing horribly.

RATING: 7
Fun filler game for those who aren't quite ready to leave. A way to add more strategy to this game would be to allow each player once per game to avoid a second hazard.

Very fun, light press your luck game.  Easily picked up by both my 4 yr. old and 7 yr. old.  Have only played with 3 so far, but I can see how this game would shine with more players.  Highly recommended as a filler and for new gamers.
One note:  really didn't like the tent/camp cards because the kids could never get the hang of revealing at the same time (plus the cards were getting beat up even with card sleeves).  We now use poker chips with a scan of part of the tent card on one side and the torch on the other -- that has worked much better for us (pick your side, hide it under your hand, all reveal at once).

A good game, best with a full group of players (8).  With 5, it feels a bit forced at times, and I wouldn't want to play with any less.  Gemstones provided can run out of supply too quickly, requiring either substitute tokens, paper recording, etc.. Production quality is great for a filler (ref. Diamant)

A great game for a bigger group of people. Definitly a wonderful gateway game! There is just one decision, the players have to take over and over again: do I go further into the temple - or do I return back to my camp. With few and simple rules this game creates a wonderful experience for up to 8 players.

I've finally played this game with five players! Twice!! For the amount of fun it delivers in just 15 minutes this one handily gets a rating of 8. This will likely be a popular request for many a game night in the future, with gamers of all ages, from pre-Med students to 11 year olds, giving their thumbs up in every game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game, but seems to need more players.  I have played this numerous times.  The problem comes with the expectations that the mine shouldn't collapse as much.  If you have this problem, consider dropping one of the sets of hazards.  Should be the same game, but slightly less chance of dying early.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The gameplay is basically a really fancy version of the timeless classic game "which hand?"  You really only have two choices at any given time; stay or go.  That's it.  

So how is this so ridiculously fun?  It just is.  Rather than condemning it for it's simplicity, I think it's about time we start giving "which hand?" the recognition it deserves. :laugh:

Must say though, that the little 2/3 size cards are a pain to shuffle, and it's hard to sneak your little meeple into your hand when playing on a glass table. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Definitely a game which shines with more players.  I do not recommend for less than 5 players.
My rating is based on this games suitability for 7 or 8 players - a hard niche to fill.

Diamant version.

The ultimate large group non-gamer filler game.

Kids burned out on this one pretty quickly.  Its a good game for a large group though.  I can get my kids to play this one once in a while.

Very good for drawing non-gamers into games though.  Bought some extra red "gems" at Hobby Lobby to help handle large groups which is usually how I play this game.  Otherwise, there is a lot of down-time as people exchange their gems.

If you play with kids, make it a point to have them administer the gems.  This is a GREAT game to teach division/remainders.  There are 5 travelers, and 17 gems were found.  Each traveler is awarded 3 gems and 2 are left on the path.

RATING: 6
My kids love (ages 9 & 10) this game.  This is the one they will always play.  The "jewels"  are lovely, and since the little miners are variously colored and their treasure chests have slogans in different languages, we have a rule that you must speak in the appropriate accent for your miner.  If you run from the mine, you must cry out appropriately accented words of cowardice.  If there is such a thing as a family party game, this game fits that description.  The game itself is not overly compelling, but the mechanics, the pretty "jewels", and the family rules make it a true gem.

Interesting little push-your-luck game.  Players are trying to decide whether to keep exploring an ancient temple to gather the treasures inside, but risk running into various hazards which would make them drop their jewels and run.  Do you press on?  Or grab the gold and run?

This is light, simple, and very easy to teach.  I like that it accommodates up to 8 players easily, with no scaling issues.  Solid components from a trusted publisher.  For what it is, this game gets a thumbs up from me.

A recent addition, primarily for using with groups of non-gamer friends.  Really easy to teach.  Oddly, my wife's biggest complaint was that the treasure piles didn't get big enough.

Components: Cool ore carts, miners, and gems, and nice artwork on the cards. With the amount of shuffling the cards must endure, I'd like them to be of better quality.

Experience: A bit of fun, but the only real thrills are a) seeing if I have managed to exit alone, or must share, and b) seeing a big treasure surface when I am alone or nearly alone in the cave. There just aren't too many decisions, and as press-your-luck games go, this one doesn't feel tense enough.

We've added a rule where everyone has to reveal whether they are going forward or going back to camp at the same time by using a "one two shoot" method--where on "shoot" everyone has to either point forward (to show they are going forward) or keep a closed fist (to show they are going back).  This ends up being one of the more fun elements of the game.

I paid a bunch of money for the German version with the board (base camp).  I could have purchased Incan Gold instead, but the board art, the explorer meeples, the pretty jewels... all these things make the game that much more enjoyable.

I have the Incan Gold version. This version differs from Diamant only with the Artifact. In every round there is one Artifact. You can win this Artifact when you are the only one who will pass. The first 3 artifact are 5 point, the last 2, 10 points.

Players enter 5 caves (rounds) in search of rubies and diamonds (each diamond = 5 rubies), but they have to make sure to get out before the cave collapses. The latter happens if the second card of 1 of 5 types of dangers is drawn. Each turn a card is drawn, showing a number of rubies, a danger or a relic (worth 1 or 2 diamonds). The number of rubies is split amongst all the adventurers equally. The rubies that cannot be equally split, remain on the card until 1 or more players decide to return. If only 1 returns he can take all the rubies that were left behind, as well as the relics, if more than 1 player returns at the same time, they have to share the rubies equally and get no relics...After each card the players have to show contemporaneously whether or not they want to return from the cave, by taking a playing piece in their hand under the table and revealing what they are holding in their hand. Players who fail to return before the cave collapses loose everything they gathered in the tunnel.

Enjoyable "push your luck" kind of game.
Quite fun to play online, not sure it would work as smoothly in the "boxed" version.
Comparing it to Can't Stop I'd say that it's definitely quicker, but you also have much less control over it.
As I said, as a 5 minute game (online) it works, but it's definitely a *VERY* light game. 
Judging from the pic nice components though :)

RATING: 6
I had high hopes for this but have been a bit underwhelmed.  The much promised schadenfreude is often undone by a second danger card of the same type coming out, ending the round before people have chance to really push their luck.  In the games I've played, conservative (aka boring) strategies have won each time.  I'm also not a fan of the pointless stay/go decisions early in a round, when there isn't enough danger to justify leaving.

As it happens to me in many push your luck games, I become too greedy. And I lose. But this doesn't subtract from the fun. It's my own decision, since I want to make some one awesome run to win me the game. And when it happens it's fantastic. In Incan Gold it works amazingly and the theme interests me more and more since I visited the great land of Peru.

Simple, pure push-your-luck game. What makes it interesting is that all players have the exact same access to the treasure/points. It comes down to when you make your decision to get out and how many other players make that same decision at the same time. Its more interesting at higher player counts because there is more contention for the same amount of treasure/points.

Ok, this game is a great to play with families with a wide age range of kids.  There is really only one decision to make each round- stay in the temple or leave, and then the round plays itself out.  This makes it accessible to my little one and my teen.  A surprising amount of tension builds on those decisions and it's fun to experience this together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game is extremely simplistic, which is both an asset and a flaw. The game boils down to a simple decision: do I stay or do I go? This makes the game very easy to teach (in about 5 minutes or less) and plays well with people who enjoy gambling or are risk takers. The game is also mindless enough that it can be played as a side activity to something else, such as watching tv.

The advantage to staying in the temple is the potential for more gems but at the risk of losing it all to a matching hazard. The advantage of going is to pick up all leftover gems on the way out and to secure any gems collected that round at the risk of losing out on anything else that comes after you've left. Leaving also has an added wrinkle of having to split all gems (and leave behind artifacts) if multiple players leave at once, meaning you don't always want to leave when everyone else does.

However, the choice to stay or go is rarely interesting. Most of the times my players couldn't even bother to use the cards, they'd just blurt out if they were staying or going (which quite frankly gives a huge advantage to the last player to call out). The only time the decisions are fun are when a player is on a long streak of cards and keeps pushing the deck. Naturally, these moments are the central mechanic of the game, yet they are so far and few between that the slog to get to them often overwhelms them. Speaking of slogs, the game is about 2 rounds too long. It doesn't seem necessary to go beyond 3 rounds, as it just drags the game out longer.

The artwork is a bit dry. The theme comes through enough, but it just seems very generic. For instance, you're supposed to show players which artifact is being added at the beginning of a new round in a sort of ooh-and-ah moment... and yet there's no discernible reason to do so. All the artifacts are the same for gameplay purposes and the artwork isn't noteworthy enough to mention every round. The only card I ever point out is the artifact that kind of looks like a toilet. There's also lots of debate on the stay and go cards whenever I teach the game. They look very similar to each other and do not contain any words on them to indicate which is which. This was likely to keep the game language independent, but EVERY SINGLE TIME I teach this game I have to remind new players which card is which multiple times. They'll often even try to argue with me, citing something in the artwork as to why the stay card should be the leave card. It seems so trivial a thing to label the cards and yet they just didn't bother.

Which is generally how I feel about the game. I can't be bothered to sit through five rounds of making boring decisions. The theme is dry, the decisions are dull, and the game doesn't give enough of those how-far-can-I-go moments to justify my attention. Even as the light filler game it is, this just feels stale. I keep the game because my family enjoys it and it's simple to teach on holidays, but I generally don't enjoy my time with it.

PS: I always find myself humming the lyrics to The Clash's song while playing.

Players explore a cave stuffed with gems, attempting to be the player with the most at the end of five rounds.  Each turn a cave card is flipped up from a deck of 30 cards.  It's either a numbered gem card, or a disaster card.  Gem cards split the number of gems between the players, with remainder staying on the card.  Disaster cards do nothing until the second disaster of that type appears.  Each round players have the option of staying in the cave and risking this rounds collection, or bugging out and "banking" their gems (plus cave remainders).   Repeat over five rounds.  The game screams "Cloud 9", which isn't a surprise given the designers, but is easier to pick up and play than that venerable classic, and works better with more people.  Lovely bits.

Pure push your luck with a fun theme. Although not explicitly mentioned in the rules, bluffing and negotiation naturally spring up during the game. It's more about the social experience than strategy (maybe I say that because I always lose), but I'd almost call it a party game. The gems look cool, but placing them and passing them out slows the game down. My biggest complaint is that the "stay/go" cards look too similar. I don't think I've gotten through a game where someone didn't "accidentally" put down the wrong card. Still, its a lot of fun, and this game is requested a lot.

Another great light push-your-luck filler.  If this can keep my young one at the table (playing a game or eating etc.) for more than 5 minutes it can't be bad.

I'd be interested to see other people's rating systems and why this isn't higher.  Every single action that every single person takes during every single round is funny.  Did someone play their card to leave the temple?  Funny!  Did someone stay in for more treasure?  Funny!  Was someone able to overcome some odds and find some big treasure?  Awesome!  Did that same person foolishly stay in one turn too long?  Even better!  I'm not scoring this an 8 and claiming it's better than, or on par with, other great games (think Terra Mystica, Agricola, etc...); I'm scoring an 8 because I'll always enjoy this, will recommend it, and probably never turn down a game.  It's excellently fun for anyone.

I played the game wrong the first time and placed all the gems on each card. It was much more tense when we followed the rules and divided up the gems among players after each card flip. The IELLO version has you shuffle all the artifacts into the deck from the beginning. It is probably better to use the Incan Gold rule of shuffling in an additional artifact at the beginning of each cave.

It plays with 8 and is a fantastic push-your-luck game.  Families can all play together and kids can be as good as adults as the strategy is simply how much you want to push your luck.

RATING: 6.5
I actually read the rules for this while the group was busy finishing up another game and taught it immediately after.  It wasn't even my copy.

At any rate, Incan Gold is a simple press-your-luck game with some great components - the cards were all linen stock and the gems were all nicely made.  On your turn, you simply decide whether you want to see the next card in the deck or take whatever spoils you've gathered so far back home and leave the other players to whatever dangers lie ahead.  That's pretty much the gist of the game.

It works like this - On a draw of a treasure card, everyone splits it down the middle and the remainder is left on the path.  If a danger card is drawn, no problem.  If a second danger card of the same type is drawn, everyone still in the temple goes home empty handed.  If an artifact is drawn, nobody gets to take it unless they are the [i]only[/i] one to choose to go home.  If you decide to go home early, you and whoever else not only gets to keep what you've already picked up, but you also get to split whatever was left on the path (minus artifacts).

That's it.  It's that simple.  It's a lot of fun with the right group, and it's really deadly for anyone who has a gambling problem haha.

First glance at the game and rules, I was intrigued.  Treasure, danger, sign me up!  We gave it quite a few playthroughs but each game our group felt ended too abruptly.  I think if the designer had changed perhaps the way the danger cards were distributed to allow the game to progress for x amount of time (say place 1/3 of the danger cards in 3 separate piles mixed with treasure then use those 3 piles to build the deck) it would have been more fun.

The highlights of this press-your-luck game are that it accommodates up to eight players and it also play quickly.  I wouldn't  really recommend it with less than five people however.  I really love the gems that you get with this and the little mine carts are also neat.  It's not my ideal game when I have 6 - 8 people but it's still pretty decent and best of all, it's really fast which is good for when you're waiting for the remainder of your players to show up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Incan Gold is a push-your-luck game that accommodates a large number of players. It's also really easy rules-wise and plays relatively quickly. During a turn, each player simultaneously chooses whether continue exploring (which flips one card, which will have wealth or a hazard) or pass (bank dived wealth and divide leftover wealth among leaving players). If doubles of a particular hazard happens, players who have been exploring, lose the opportunity to bank their wealth. Incan Gold is more recent iteration of the game Diamant. While I feel Diamant has nicer components, Incan Gold has some additional gameplay mechanisms that make the game more fun. Iello will be doing a new edition of Diamant in 2016 which will included Incan Gold's enhancements but Diamant's superior components. So, it should be the best of both worlds.

RATING: 6
A purely press-your-luck game that actually lets you press your luck twice. The first and most obvious press is choosing whether or not to continue exploring (pressing against the deck), but the second is choosing when to leave the temple (pressing against your opponents). Incan Gold glimmers most at higher player counts when the social deduction element associated with that second press is at its most excruciating. The rapid play time, and scalability make this a worthy press-your-luck addition.

Nice, light "push your luck" game. The Incan Gold version is the cheaper" alternative to Diamant but with it being sold exclusively at Funagain, that doesn't make it cheaper. Worse, the Incan Gold version forces you to bend your cards to form tents, leaving tears on the cards! And for that, you pay US$20. This is one of those games I don't mind playing, but I'll never buy it.

[1 play] I can’t really see why this has a separate entry from Diamant, but I guess that’s a controversy for another thread.   I had played Diamant once or twice some time back when I tried Incan Gold.  The play is much the same, to the best of my recollection, but in terms of production, Diamant has the edge in several ways.  

The most annoying thing about Incan Gold is the stay or go cards.  In Diamant you do this with a little piece that you do or don’t have in your hand; everyone puts their hands out, and then you show.  With Incan Gold it’s two different cards, and the super-annoying thing about them is how similar looking they are.  Both have a picture of a guy in a cave with a torch.  The picture isn’t the same, and when you look closely you see that on the "Go" card, you can see the tent in the background through the mouth of the cave, the torch has burned lower, and the guy is now carrying a sack of treasure.  Nice thematic details, but what you need here is two cards that really obviously differentiate themselves at a glance, both to avoid making mistakes on your own play (which did happen in our game at least once) and so that when cards are revealed, you can immediately see what everyone did.  I call this a definite design fail.

Incan Gold did offer one unique and somewhat hair-raising experience.  My friend’s copy was new, and we had to set up the tents ourselves, by bending the cards.  It gives me the creeps just to write that, but yes, bending the cards.  I deliberately took a playing card and bent it in half and creased the hell out of it.  And I have to say, it felt perverse and wrong.

(As of [b]5[/b] plays) A fun push-your-luck game with simple rules non-gamers can pick up easily. Gameplay is repetitive, but often tense, as the simple act of choosing whether to stay or leave becomes fraught with portent. A great party game.

Own the Gryphon Games bookshelf edition, Incan Gold.  Based on the original Diamant.  A fairly short and light simultaneous-action press-your-luck game for 3-8 players, easy-to-learn and suitable as a fun family/group game.  The Artifacts are a good addition to the original form of the game.  Has received multiple plays already, and I expect this will continue given how the "press-your-luck" aspect is popular with everyone who tries it.

"Should I stay or should I go!?" - The Clash... Literally, that is the game.

This game is beautifully simplistic and fantastic to play with kids because it is so intuitive and effectively an older player can run it like a casino game.  For an adult it's ok but a little lacking, my personal preference leads towards Celestia but with kids, this one wins hands-down, every time.

Comparatively to Celestia this one works on known odds so it is in that sense a little more mathematically strategic in the same way a game like Blackjack is where as Celestia is more social and a bit of luck.

This game will be a clear hit or miss depending on what you are after.

I like the wooden explorer-hatted meeples in Diamant better than the cards in Incan Gold, and the cardboard mining wagons in Diamant are better than the folded-card tents in Incan Gold.

If this game is combined with Incan Gold, I should comment that my rating for Incan Gold is quite a bit lower (a 6 as compared with a 9.)

Based on 3 plays.
+ The rules cannot get any simpler than this
+ Calculating probabilities of "collapse" on the fly is challenging
+ Double-guessing other player's actions is always nice
> "Push your luck", and that's all.
- Totally luck-driven, so should be short

RATING: 6.5
Reasonably fun filler that will take up to 8. 

It's played over five rounds each consisting of a variable amount of turns.

Each turn a card is turned over and it will either have a number on it or one of several hazards. If it has a number, gems are shared out amongst the players with the remainder going on the card. Once two hazzards of the same type appear in a system, that round is over and you lose any gems that aren't safely put away. 

Each player then simultaneously decides whether to take the gems and put them away safely for another round. Last player in takes the gems from the cave.

A quick little push-your-luck filler game that can play up to eight.
Really nice components, slot together mine carts for storing gems are a nice touch.

EDIT: having played Incan gold I prefer the tents to the mine carts as more treasure fits in the tent therefore its more difficult to tell who is leader.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really enjoy this push your luck game however it suffers slightly  when a player pushes their luck in the first round and gets a substantial lead and then wimps out running away early in the following rounds to safeguard their lead.

The Art work is nice but the temple cards themselves are a little superfluous.

I prefer the foldout tents in this to the mine carts from diamant as they hold more treasures and are more secret i.e. you can easily see a half full mine cart.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good fun game of brinkship. Better than Can't Stop, nice bits, very quick play. Plays best with more people, up to 8, the more the merrier. Some tactics, bailing very early can nab you 4 or 5 gems alone, more than you'd get going deeper. Worth playing, worth buying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is quite a fun game!  It rewards taking risks, but also sensible timing of when to bail and take extra points along the way.  There's a good amount of suspense when waiting for the next card.  When hazards cause disasterous results, one of the bad cards is removed to increase the chances for the players on the next round.

Simple, elegant, and PURE FUN!  Probably my favorite "push-your-luck" type game.  Grade: B

Push your luck with increasing temptations to make your decisions tougher as the exploration goes on.  This is a game where the mood of the players will make or break the fun to be had.  The mechanics are so simple one has to spice things up a bit with a fair measure of taunting, teasing and goading.  Chicken calls usually intice the players to draw that last fatal tile.  Lots of fun with the right crowd.

RATING: 8
Only played it with 3 so far. As such, I would rate it a 6. But I can see it become more (party) fun with more players, therefor a 7.

It's a nice & quick Can't Stop like game, with a little added math, some bluffing & a bit of interaction. But apart from that, there's still not much more than plain luck in here. You could f.i. draw a snake, then a small treasure, everyone decides to continue exploring and if then by accident the next card would already be the next snake, the round is over. Sessions that don't have such early buggers can be huge fun, but with at least two rounds finishing this quickly, it takes away quite a bit of the fun. I would have given it a higher score, if somehow the danger could be anticipated a bit more.

A small variant could be to take out 10 cards before each round and divide them over piles of 2, 3 & 5 cards next to the temple. A player could pay this amount of gems to take a look at the cards that won't show up in the path to explore. More and probably even better variants can be thought of, but still I can't see how you could avoid rounds to possibly end after just a couple of cards. Though maybe it could help to state that a round would only finish after the 2nd PAIR of danger cards being revealed ?

This is one of those games like Looping Louie that everyone loves, but you can't pull it out too often.  I'd say this is my favorite super light 7+ player game.  I have the Incan Gold version.

[Incan Gold] OK.  I get it.  This has always had fairly consistently good reviews.  And now I see why.  Very tense, and very hilarious.  The game consists of painful decisions, while trying to keep your poker face.  I can't imagine playing with all 8 players... must be truly hilarious.  I put this in a class of psycho-strategy games, like Citadels (but MUCH less deep), or even Beat the Buzzard (but with a smidge more depth).  And I LOVE those 2.

So simple to play, one little decision each turn (in or out??).  Makes for fun bluffing and adventure.  My game club requests this filler a lot, and there is always laughing and groaning and yelling.  The bits are really nice, though the cards used for the decision to explore further or escape could use sleeve protectors since those 2 cards get held by grubby hands for the whole game every game.

Diamant: This is a very good game - takes up to 8 players, plays quickly, the bits are beautiful and it's fun. I just don't find it very interesting. It has drama, it's easy to play and easy to teach, but there's not much to think about.

Incan Gold: This is Diamant's less attractive younger sister. She still has the personality, but she's not as pretty and people don't want to spend so much time partying with her. The replacement of the meeples by cards sucks. If I'd seen Incan Gold before Diamant I would have completely ignored it.

A wonderful push your luck/ risk management game in which players assume the roles of prospectors looking for a quick payday in a dangerous mine.  Although the mechanics here are very simple, the gameplay can (if played in the right crowd) offer a lot of fun without much commitment to time or brain power.  The more I play the more I enjoy this.  I can't really explain why, as this is about as basic as a game design gets, but man does this one get tense when played over again with the same group.  I agree that the Indiana Jones variant is well worth adding to the game.

My wife and oldest both like this so I got my own copy. Always goes over well with the non gamers.

My own version due to difficulty to find and too expensive when found, so can't comment on components. (mine are nice tho)
Anyway, a 'push your luck' game of mining for gems. do you risk it all at each bend of the mine hoping to strike it richer? or take what you have and run and hope you don't have to watch your opponents get richer? fun, slightly tense and social game.

On the plus side: it's a fun, fast, easy to learn game that's great for a larger number of players.

On the minus side: it's not really that deep of a play experience, so you're only really going to want to use it to fill space in between other games or at the end of the night.

Acquired 6-16-2007.

[Original comment] This is a fun, push-your-luck game. It's easy to learn and play, and plays quickly. We have enjoyed it with eight players; it scales well.

May 2009 -- This is a fun push-your-luck game that we bring out now and then.

October 2011 -- I own the Incan Gold version, and my son-in-law has the Diamont version. I like his components better, but also enjoy the artifact cards in my version. It is a fun game for a short available game time.

2013-November:  We continue to enjoy this occasionally.

A fun little push your luck game with lovely bits and attractive cards. This always goes down well at the end of an evening when there is no time or energy for another 'big' game. Plays a bit differently with more rather than less players. More is better in my opinion, but it's OK with 3 or 4 too. 26/12/2005: This is th egame I am most likely to bring out when we need a light game for 7 or 8 people. Definitely more fun and tense with bigger groups.

I've rated this highly because it's a kids push your luck game and our kids love it.  I've played it with kids as young as 4/5 years old and with a little guidance they manage and find the game exciting.  I HATE having to bend the cards into tents... but once you turn the game over to kids they ruin all the cards anyway.  :)  I might need a new copy soon.

RATING: 5
Minimalistic game of chicken for larger groups.

Players are collectively exploring a cave in search of treasure by flipping cards that either have a pile of gems or a hazard on it. Any gems found are divided equally by the players, leaving any remaining gems on the card. Hazard cards come in a few varieties (for example snakes), with three cards of each variety. The hazard cards don't give any pay-out, and whenever a second card of any type is revealed, all players still exploring the cave lose all gems they carry. 

Before revealing the next card to explore, all players choose simultaneously if they want to continue on or go back to the camp with whatever gems they have found so far. Players returning to the camp are allowed to pick up any gems that were previously left on the cards, but if more than one player are returning at the same time, they must again share the loot equally.

After all players have either returned to the camp safely or succumbed to one of the dangers in the cave, the cards are reshuffled and the players have a go at exploring the next cave. At the conclusion of the fifth cave exploration, the player with the most collected gems wins.

The choices you make during the game are not very deep nor particularly interesting, and the game is very reliant on there being a fitting social atmosphere for it to be much fun. You can do some card counting to figure out your chances, and there is a timing problem of when to bolt for the exit. But in practice the game relies much more on the group dynamics of the players. This makes the game very dependant on the group playing it, and it falls flat if nobody is in the right mood. Also, the number of players greatly changes the dynamics of the game and it seems to play much better with larger groups. 

But still, the game doesn't do anything particularly wrong either. As long as it's seen as a 15 minute push-you-luck party game for groups of minimum five players I think it works well.

I'm generally not enamored of the whole "press your luck" genre, but Diamant is among the best of the bunch.  Play is simultaneous and fast-paced, so the game does a great job of supporting a large table of players.  I enjoy the odds evaluation, the double-guessing element, and the way that a player's current standing (in terms of banked gems) influences his choices.  Recommended.

[JAN 09] [Rating: 5]
The rules are quite simple for this game and can be taught in a few minutes which certainly it the game’s largest merit. If you should you stay or flee is the only decision you have to make every turn which for me feel a little simplistic. There is an underlying psychology behind this, but for me there is too little to base that on. In e.g. [GAMEID=45] you have the history of guesses to base this on, but you can’t do that here. The good thing here is that is plays pretty quickly.

I like when there are many players for this game. I prefer this with 5 or 6 players and it is one of the few games that play well with many players.

Played twice. Good light push your luck fun. The need to constantly make change as the single units run out is a bit of a pain. Played well with 6 which is nice. September 2011

*UPDATE* Played a couple of times with 8 and it was easy to follow what was happening while being sociable within the group. Good light fun. I'll put my rating upto a 7. Nov 2011

*UPDATE* Now played my 15th game. Always with 5 or more players. Don't fancy it with less. This and No Thanks! work well with my none gaming In-laws. I'd put it up to an 8 for its accessibility and then drop it back to a 7 because of the annoyance of having to make change throughout the game. July 2013

I think I've figured out why I liked this game more than most similar light options. It's because it boils down the experience of playing a new game to its essentials: you make decisions whose consequences are almost totally unclear in advance, and then somebody wins or loses or something. And I do love playing new games. So, this simulates the thrilling arc of playing a new game, without the challenge or intellectual interest of, like, actually playing a new game.

Or maybe I just enjoy hoarding plastic gems.

I like the simple principle and the ever-recurring question wether to go deeper or to retreat with what you have. Although i generally do not like games with a high luck factor, i found this to be entertaining once in a while. Good filler game, but definitely not something i want to play the whole evening... or every day.

I enjoy this one because it plays quick and is accessible to non-gamers.  It can be a pretty rowdy affair and there's a lot of tension when most people have dropped out and only a few decide to keep going.

Joc molt simple en el que uns exploradors han d'anar endinsant-se dins 5 coves (1 per ronda) per anar recollint els tresors que en elles s'hi amaguen. Però en compte! cal sortir de la cova abans que un, dels 5 perills que s'hi amaguen, aparegui per segona vegada si no volem quedar-nos sense res.

Tütütütü-tütütü-tütütütü-tü-tü-tü-tü
Egyik kedvenc partijátékomról nem nehéz dicsérő szavakat írnom. 3-8 játékos (2 játékos variáns is van) kincskereső kalandorokat, Indiana Jones-okat testesítenek meg, akik Közép-Amerika egyik ősi templomának 5 szintjét végigkutatva próbálják a legtöbb értéket magukénak tudni.
Mindenki egy csapatban indul neki az egyes szinteknek (5 fordulóból áll egy játék), majd lépésről lépésre fedik fel a húzópakli lapjait, amelyek a folyosón található kincseket/ereklyéket vagy veszedelmeket ábrázolják.
Amint kincset találnak, egyenlően osztozkodnak (a többlet kincs rákerül a felhúzott kártyára) és mindenki eldönti, hogy tovább marad bent a templomban vagy az eddig megszerzett „loot”-al együtt elhagyja azt (plusz távozáskor felveheti a kártyán vagy kártyákon rajtamaradt többlet kincset is. Itt is egyenlően kell osztozkodni, ha többen távoznak egyszerre; tehát előfordulhat, hogy senki nem kap a kártyákról semmit, ha többen is távoznak egyszerre, mint amennyi felé osztható lenne a rajtamaradt kincs).
A döntését kártyalap (fáklya vagy tábor kártya = bent marad vagy távozik) felmutatásával jelzi, amelyet mindenki egyszerre hajt végre.
A távozók a megszerzett kincseket eltehetik kis sátraikba a többiek számláló szemétől elrejtve, míg a bent maradó játékosok új lapot húznak fel.
Hogy ne legyen egyszerű az élet, a húzópakliban a játék kezdetén 5 típusú veszedelemből (kőomlás, zombi pap, pókok, tűzdémon, kígyó) 3-3 lap kerül bele.
Amikor lapot húz a csapat és egy veszedelem kerül felfedésre az alábbi történhet. 1. Amennyiben még nem került ugyanilyen típusú veszedelem felhúzásra, semmi nem történik. 2. Amennyiben már került ilyen típusú veszedelem felhúzásra, a bent maradt kalandorok kincseiket hátrahagyva kimenekülnek a Templomból (nem kapnak semmit ebben a fordulóban). Valamint ez a veszedelem kártya kikerül a játékból (csökkentve a későbbi fordulókban megjelenő veszedelmeket).
Plusz minden fordulóban a pakliba kerül 1-1 értékes ereklye is (így az utolsó fordulóban akár 4-5 ereklye is lehet a pakliban). Viszont az ereklyét mindig csak egyetlen egy távozó kincsvadász viheti ki, ha többen távoznak egyszerre, az a helyén marad és a későbbiekben távozó kalandorok egyike szerezheti meg.
Tehát a tipikus „elég bátor vagy, hogy húzz még egy lapot” játékmenetet a fenti „fűszerek” ízesítik kellemes eledellé. Kockáztatsz vagy nem. Néha muszáj, de egy-egy megfontoltabb lépéssel is megnyerhető a parti.
Picit érthetetlen, hogy hazai piacon miért nem lehet beszerezni ezt a játékot. Egyszerű szabályok, gyors játékmenet, izgalom és vidámság. Szívesen ajánlom mindenkinek.

A bit more chaotic than most push your luck games, it nevertheless has great appeal due to the emotional payoff. It reminds me of that part at the end of a round of Ra when everyone chants for the Ra tiles to come up while the one player left in chants for anything else to come up. This is a lot of fun. I like that you can play with so many people, and I like the way that there are reasons to leave the mine even if there is no risk of losing your gems.

What I like with that game is that it gets better as the number of player increases, and is easily taught to non gamers.

Diamant is a quick and simple push-your-luck game with beautiful production value. The decisions every turn happen incredibly fast, either you're in or your out. Because of ease-of-play, it's not difficult to teach to non-gamers. Furthermore, this isn't a game in which all players are playing in parallel, there's built in incentive to make otherwise counter-intuitive moves to jump out of the competition to grab stray gems left behind on the path. This gives the game a bit of meat for more hardened gamers. Overall, a great fast-paced excercise in risk-management that does not overstay its welcome.

[Initial Impression: 6] A fun and quick push-your-luck game, with some bluffing and anticipation thrown in for good measure. There's little that is more satisfying than clearing out of the temple early, taking a few treasures all for yourself, and then watching as the walls close in on all the other players as the next card reveals a matching hazard. Not too much to think about, but super easy to learn, and good fun!

Played with a 5 year old, and he won. However, adults won't be bored while playing. This is the ultimate gateway game. It takes 4 minutes to explain. Replay value is medium. The game does require removing the enter/exit cards, and using the alternate bravery beads as suggested on this site. Additionally, the 1-5 cards add nothing to the game, but to confuse new players, so it's best to remove them, and use the unplaced idols as a way to see what round you're on.

RATING: 7
Basic yet fun and slightly addictive risk-taking game. I didn't necessarily like the art of Incan Gold (American version), so I made my own Indiana Jones themed bonus cards to play with (see image gallery if remotely interested). Light enough to be played with kids, but still a quick and fun filler game for adults or your non-gaming friends.

RATING: 6
Good "Press Your Luck" game.  It is also interractive as you try to guess if your fellow players will leave or not.  

When a single player leaves, they may be able to get a windfall that can never be overcome.  In all, I think the game is about right on 15 minutes of play time.

Interesting decision making game where taking the same decision as other can lead to a lower gain yield. That force you to vary your strategy otherwise the opponents might figure it out and beat you to it.

There isn't really any true decisions in the game. Sure you decide if you go on or not. You can even calculate the probabilities, but if you do that I don't think this game is for you. This game is just lots of mindless fun for greedy people who like to push on even though all the hazards are on the table.

What allows you to openly enjoy the suffering of your fellow players on their loss of treasure? What has very simple rules, fast play, that accommodates up to 8 players? Diamant! or Inca Gold! or whatever incarnation it currently is. The push-your-luck factor is way up there, and as a party game, this simply rocks. Admittedly, the diamond and ruby plastic gems are a beauty to behold, versus the current opaque stuff. The bid mechanic where you palm or don't palm your adventurer is quicker than the current card selection method. The box seems bigger than it should be though, and the game (in either version) seems way overpriced for what you get. Also, since it is soooo simple, about one play is all that most can stand in an evening.

Update (10/10/09): Well, the game is a little bit more sophisticated than I gave it credit for, since we were playing it slightly wrong--the leftover gems are not added to subsequent treasure finds and divided up; they are only picked up by explorers who are leaving! This significantly alters the dynamics of play, as now there is an incentive to leave earlier than usual. The crafty player who knows when to leave and take what he/she can get will usually win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played the 2009 Gryphon version after playing Diamant previously. In general, the artwork/graphics is superior to the earlier edition. There are more gems, and more colors, but not as enticing as the rubies and diamonds of Diamant. The cards are linen-finished and slick. The tents are more functional, although flimsier than the thick-cardboard chests of Diamant. Gone is the wooden expedition meeple, replaced by a pair of "in or out" cards, which is functionally equivalent, but the tactile feel of the meeple in hand is somewhat missed. The artifacts give an additional layer of strategy to leave earlier, which elevates what is a good party game filler to a very good filler that plays up to 8 players, all in 20-30 minutes.

Update (01/11/13) 12 plays: Just because it can handle up to 8 players doesn't mean you should necessarily play this. Tried it out on seven board gaming neophytes, and it was a mixed bag. The problem is that the game's sweet spot is probably around five players, not eight. This is because most of the time, the 8 players are not getting anything, and at most two gems if a '17' card pops up. Everyone will stay, since nothing exciting is happening, and then it is all disappointment when a second catastrophe strikes. So, the overall first-impressions are ho-hum. It does tend to get better, as the tension mounts. Some people got excited, while others were being put to sleep. It was slightly better with the second play, as some were frantic to try bettering their scores (of zero, or a few gems)! Can't satisfy everyone all the time.

Indiana Jones does Vegas.  The ruleset is simple, robust, and can be grasped in under a minute.  Simultaneous play makes it go fast and smooth regardless of the number of players (up to eight).  If  you got a hankerin' for gettin' yer gamble on, you can't go wrong with this one—to get any better it would have to have Nazi-punching and showgirls.  Or some kind of mutant combo of the two.  Best as a party-style light filler or night ender.  Recommended.

NO WHAMMIES!! NO WHAMMIES!! BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!

Mindless.  It isn't a game, it is a psychology experiment.  I had more fun removing an ingrown hair.  Totally a runaway leader game.  If one player makes a big haul early, might as well save yourself the effort and call it a game.  The other players will dilute the gem resources so that no one else really catches up and by the time the last guy is ready to leave the mine; OOOOOOOHHH WHAMMY!!!!!!!!!! BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!  Ugh.  Does the fun ever start?

If offered a choice between playing this again or having a nail pounded into my crotch ala "The Serpent & The Rainbow", my answer will be "where do you keep the claw hammer?".

A straight forward press-your-luck game. I've found that anyone who has ever played blackjack will take to this one pretty quickly. Not a lot of depth -- there a tiny amount of card counting that can tip the odds for/against slightly -- this is essentially a "party game". I had fun the couple of times I played it but the situations in which I would play a game like this don't come up very often.

Playing with three, there isn't enough tension and strategizing.   Also, the production quality is very weak for a game that cost $20 from and by Funagain.  I'm very unimpressed with Funagain and will think twice before buying another game they have published.

Not a bad game, just really, really light. You besically just have to decide each round do you want to risk losing all your gained points for more points or back off. It's a fine small filler and can be played with many players but you won't want to play too many rounds of it since the simple risk management wears thin quickly.

Fifteen minutes of "push your luck" that's all about having a laugh and creating an atmosphere.  If this game doesn't have you smiling then you're probably dead.

Quick fun push your luck filler!

Played with 3 to 7 players and they have been fun. I think it plays better with more players because you get larger amounts left on the cards, which is better at tempting players to go back to camp.

Diamant version.

This game is a silly, quick push-your-luck game of diamond mine adventuring.  While I like the hard decisions of whether to stay and hunt over fleeing to reap the quick, sure benefits early, I find the game rather luck dependant and chaotic.  Thankfully, Diamant is quick and to the point.  With that said, I don't see myself ever turning a game down as this is one of the best fillers out there for that play-the-odds gameplay I often adore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great artwork. Still a simple push your luck game, but with a edge added by how the loot is divided and the fact you can pick some of it up on the way back. This makes it desirable to be the only one going back on a particular turn. Adds a bit of social deduction into the mix.

Description: Mine for precious jewels. The longer you mine the greater the reward, but the greater the risk of losing it all.

Pro: Great press-your-luck mechanic provides the ability to come back from behind. Fun prisoner's dilemma situation when deciding to cut out with your treasure. Simple enough to be easily accessible to casual gamers. Mechanics are very appropriate for the theme. Great components.

Con: Minimal complexity and strategy. Graphics could have more detail and variety.

Fills a prized niche since it plays quick and handles up to 8. I would never turn down a game. However, if one player takes a big lead, which is not uncommmon, most of the fun tension evaporates. I'd rate this a 9 or 10 as a kids game.

This game doesn't work well with my Grandparents, as they need more time to make their decisions.  It might get easier for them if we play it more, but I'm inclined to pick games that are more their pace.

This is a good filler for a crowd that can decide what to do quickly

Great family game, great filler!  Also, as has been pointed out to me, would make the BEST drinking game.  A lot of laughter, a lot of suspense, with good production value, I really like this game a lot, and it is always popular, especially at the end of a game night. 

Essentially, this could be a card game.  All you REALLY need is the fifteen cards, and some counters.  However, the artwork is really nice, and it adds to the experience to use the crates and the wooden miners.  

NOTE: The new edition doesn't have the playing field, or as many gems.  You can get an image of the playing field, and possibly get more gems from the company.

We have a lot of fun with this great family game.

I do have some grumbles about the cards.  I wish that the "should I stay or should I go" cards were easier to tell apart.  I wish that they had different backs than the rest of the deck so they wouldn't get mixed up so easily.

A fun light little filler game that is pure push your luck, kinda like "Can't Stop". This is the better game, more atmosphere and more people can play so more fun overall. The push your luck in this is more fun as well as people have to decide together whether or not they will stay to risk or take what they got and run. 

Good end of the night game and much better played in person than online and the more players the better (playing with 4 or less not worth it)

Update: Played with the family and even they were bored due to there being no decisions.

Homemade version.

Great push your luck game, I really like this.  Very, very light: my five year old needs a little help (usually on a grown-up's "team") but my seven year old is usually in to very near the end.

The kids really like this and were very quickly figuring out how to divide the "treasure" equally.  We exchanged pennies, nickels, and dimes for the diamonds and rubies... figured it would help with money counting skills...

Always interesting to see who the risk takers are in the group.  Give the tile/card distribution to people wanting a bit more weight to the game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an addicting game. It's like Pringles commecials, "You can't eat just one." well you can't play just one game. Reminds me very much of Can't Stop and Cloud 9, both games that I enjoy. I rate it a 9 because it's fast, fun, easy to teach, and there's hardly a better filler game out there.

**Update** After over 50 plays, I can still appreciate that it can be fun but mostly I just don't want to play anymore.  I still bring it to every game day/night because it's popular but I would very rarely ever suggest playing it anymore. And so my rating has dropped from a 9 to 7

Also fun just with the adults (we played with 4 adults).  There is literally only a single binary choice to make each round (very simple), yet there is potentially much thought to put into that choice from calculating odds to guessing what the other players will do.

RATING: 8.5
Great FAST game that plays better the more people you have. If you are looking for a game to start up your gaming session before people break into smaller groups or a game to wrap up your gaming sessions after folks have rejoined from heavier games, I recommend Incan Gold. 

Summing up the game in three words: press you luck. -- June 2010

RATING: 6
Better than average filler, but not at all intellectually satisfying. Tension should be higher than it actually is--I won the game I played, but felt little emotional stake. It's kind of like, "what the heck, I'll try this. Oh, it worked? OK. Now what."

RATING: 6.5
Great game for a large social group, and easy enough for younglings to understand. Not a great deal of depth, but a great change of pace game.

RATING: 6
Incan Gold is a solid luck-pushing game. It has a few issues such as rules that always seem to be a little confusing for new players (especially regarding what happens to treasures when players leave the temple), the potential for some players to wind up so far behind that can't leave the temple in the late rounds, and the unclear artwork on the decision cards (I've seen quite a few people play the wrong card accidentally).

In spite of its flaws, it can be an absolute riot. There can be real drama in how the game unfolds, everything from players waiting one card too long to flee to players who leave too early only to find out that the next several cards provided a plethora of treasures. That along with its short play length and ability to support a large number of players makes it a solid addition to one's game library.

What I liked about this game was that I could introduce it to my non-gamer friends and they were able to easily pick it up and enjoy the suspenseful nature of the game with me. 

The only downside is that sometimes there's too much downtime between leaving the mine and entering the next and so boredom strikes easily for those who leave.

I tend to buy quite a few filler games, and I think I need more plays of this one to truly appreciate it.

Played this 5 times in a 7 player game.  None of us had played before.  It was a blast!  Most want to play again.  It's quick and light, but is a great filler while waiting for others to show up.

Incan Gold was one of the first games I ever played, it can be fun with the right crowd, but nowadays I don’t have the slightest wish to play it. It is way too basic and simple for my current tastes. Still I recognize it can be a blast. Its main strengths are: 1. Very easy to teach. 2. It plays quickly and 3. It can accommodate a large number of players without significantly add to the game time.

I dislike that I had to bend the tent cards.

I’m sure I will play again, but this is not a game I will ever request.

A light and quick game which will play up to eight without bogging down.  Its quickness is its saving grace, because at its core is the need to read which of a binary set of choices one's fellow gamers will make.  That could get boring and/or frustrating after too long, but Diamant is quick enough to avoid crossing the "too long" threshold.

This is an interesting push your luck game. It can play a bunch of people which is nice, and the rules are pretty straight forward.  The downside seems to be that one can't take a direct action against whomever is ahead, as the only negative action would be negative for yourself too.  Overall though this a a decent light game that plays pretty quickly.

Why didn't I play this one sooner?  Here's an awesome game that easily jumps into my top 10 favorites...maybe even top 5.  It's a mix of simplicity, push your luck and danger that makes for something near perfect.  When you decide to stick it out for "just one more turn" and get hit with that second hazard, it's defeat of the highest marks.  But man, when you push through to be the last explorer and get 15 gems all to yourself...that's what winning is all about!  Awesome game!  Oh and I love the tents!

Excellently themed game, exciting to play.  Would definitely get a higher mark if the game weren't so darned simple.  Also, it always seems like you lose if you play conservatively, and you lose if you play aggressively, but if you play conservatively, your aggressive opponents will win, and if you play aggressively, your conservative opponents will win.  This aspect is frustrating, and makes me feel like there isn't a whole lot of skill to this game (some, but not much).

Super simple mechanics. Tense decisions. I think what really makes this a cut above almost all other push-your-luck games are the considerations given for the correct timing of when you leave. Not only do you usually get some additional award if you leave early, but getting the artifacts depends upon being the ONLY one to leave on a turn. This little wrinkle adds a nice layer of bluffing and reading your opponents. Premium family game.

A game of Incan Gold can go one of two ways, and when the group doesn't immediately click with it there's no saving the session. That said, with a group willing to throw themselves into wild chances and bluffs, it's pretty good.

RATING: 6
Incan Gold is a simple, faced paced card game that's good in casual settings. Each player is an explorer looting an Incan temple. At the beginning of the turn, players simultaneously reveal whether they are going deeper into the temple or heading back to camp with their treasure. As the game goes on, players who have not returned to camp yet face greater odds of losing all of their treasure from the current round. So, Incan Gold is about pressing your luck and knowing when to quit. Sometimes, you'll score big for leaving at the right time. Sometimes, you'll score big for pushing onward after everyone else bails out. Nice artwork. Not as good as For Sale, No Thanks!, Liar's Dice, or Master of Rules, but passable. Better than Coloretto, at least.

RATING: 7
Another great game by Gryphon Games. Explore an Incan tomb and get out while the getting is still good. A fun fast paced, and quick game, mostly based on luck and how much of a risk you want to take. The art and the game pieces are cool. And we always have fun playing it.

This can be a fun "press your luck" game with interesting outcomes, but can also often feel "too light" since the only actual action to perform in the game is to make a decision to keep going or to stop.

The only real strategy comes from getting into the heads of the other players to try to guess what they'll do.

Have played this one twice. It really lines up with For Sale, but I see a few deficiencies here. First of all, there is a lost leader problem. If, during the first round, one person ends up with a large stack, it puts them in a very easy position. I do like the way that it plays 8 so well. I also like the pieces, even the tents. I do think that it would be neat if the artifacts offered special abilities beyond just being worth points. Extra rules would be neat, though I've never really looked for any yet.

Waste of money. I watched a Dice Tower review and thought it'd be a fun purchase, but I can't seem to have any fun playing it. The components didn't make me want to play, and the excitement wasn't really there to see what card was flipped over next. I was wishing that there be a more suspenseful buildup. Maybe include 4 of each danger, and wait until 3 are revealed? It seemed like 2 would always come out too soon before anyone got a big payoff.

A very good party game with a little bit of strategy. Everyone seems to enjoy the exciting decisions throughout the game. Usually provides fun moments and thrash talk around the table. Lenghts-wise this is a great gateway game. Short play time leads often to more than one game with new players.

RATING: 8
Wonderful little combination of blind-bidding and push-your-luck. My intuition sucks when trying to predict other players' bids, but pretty good when assessing whether or not to push my luck. The archeologist theme is good. Very fun game every time I've played it.

Have raised my rating of this one based on the fact that we pull it out so often. It's a great little filler, especially with new players and larger numbers. One of our most-played games. 
It's nice (in a slightly snobby way) to have the German version with the cute treasure chests and Indiana Jones meeples, but it's no different to play from Incan Gold.

Pushing your luck can be an interesting side show. Having it be the only thing done in the game isn't too great, though.

I swore I'd never play this again after the first play, but then ended up having to give it a second chance due to somebody dumping their 10 year old stepson into the already 5 player group, and Diamant was the only thing judged simple enough. The kid seemed to have fun, but I was ready to gouge my eyes out. Never again, even if it means sitting out.

RATING: 7
Light, fun, overpriced - it's everything everyone else says it is.  The dynamics of the game change greatly according to the number of players.  Sometimes I have a problem with the distribution of cards when the disasters keep piling up one after another.

Update: Having played Incan Gold, I vastly prefer the components of Diamant, though the artifact cards in Incan Gold are an interesting addition that give further enticement to bail out early.

I like this less than Diamant, mainly because of the lower quality components. The addition of the relics is interesting, and added incentive to leave the mine, but I don't see it as necessary or a definite improvement.

(Almost)an instant hit with my gaming group! For the very first play, the two first rounds went all wrong! No gold or anything, for anyone! And there was a lot of "What´s the point!?" talk going on... Even I had my doubts... Then the game kicked in, and we all loved it! A lot of bluffing and double-bluffing going on!

RATING: 5
In this push-your-luck game of tile flipping your only choice each turn is whether to stay or go, the prospective payout for each option depending on tiles flipped, the total number of players, and simultaneous decisions of other players. At least given attractive components and a slightly fatalistic approach I reckon this could be a decent entry-level game and game theory exercise. Some observations, which together may or may not be taken as flaws: 1) When a player is allowed to remain alone in an expedition, the flipping of tiles can be extremely swingy: a single tile can give them a significant portion of the points a safe strategy can yield for the entire game. 2) It is not very uncommon for an expedition to end before anyone has had a chance to earn a non-negligible amount of points, meaning many games will effectively have four or even three expeditions. This obviously matters a lot more if someone gets an early lead. 3) Once someone has a good lead, each other player has no choice but to adopt a risky strategy for the remainder of the game, or until they strike lucky themselves. (Of course, if scores are hidden and untracked, a player may unwittingly surrender any hope of winning.) 4) The more players adopt a risky strategy, the more all of their prospects are reduced. 5) Consequently, adopting an early safe strategy amounts to betting that no player will be risky and lucky, and conversely, adopting an early risky strategy amounts to betting that at least one risky player will be lucky. In either case, as soon as someone that is not you is both risky and lucky, you are almost certainly playing out a losing game. 6) Players should divide somewhat evenly into safe and risky in order for the game to be balanced overall. A lone risky player should have the highest chance to win, followed by a lone safe player.

Feels like a modern age classic push your luck gateway game. The mechanics are simple, after each card do you stay in and risk hazards or runout with your collected loot. The sharing remains with others who also run adds an interesting social decision that more experienced games can enjoy too.

Easy to teach. Fun to play. Appeals to lots of people. One of my favorite games to bring out for people who don't play games.

It works best when you create the right social environment: get people talking, laughing, and taking risks. This is a dud if you play this with cautious introverts who sit quietly and play conservatively. If that's the group you should avoid this game, or have someone run the game to create the social conditions that move this from an okay game to a great experience.

Original version of Incan Gold.  Basically the same gameplay, with the exception of there not being Artifact cards in this version.  The components are nicer in Diamant, as well.  The creators have posted rules you can use to use the 1 treasure card to signify artifacts to include artifacts in this game to make it more like Incan Gold in that respect.

RATING: 5
The minimal decision of (a) turning over another card in the hope of revealing loot, or (b) retreating with loot already earned before turning over another threat, is not really enough for me. I don't even find it particularly tense. Doesn't feel like the stakes are high enough. Maybe if I had to do something else beforehand to 'earn' going into the tomb in the first place?

En su gran sencillez reside su éxito. Para jugar con grupos grandes (5 o más) y en los momentos en los que primen las risas por encima de juegos más estratégicos (este no lo es en absoluto).

Sobre todo indicado para grupos de no jugones.

Vas avanzando (desvelando cartas) por camino y vas encontrando diamantes o peligros. Cuanto más te adentras, más peligroso es el camino (van acumulándose peligros) y más atractiva es la recompensa (los diamantes se reparten entre menos gente, los valientes que siguen adelante).

Si salen 3 cartas del mismo peligro, pierdes todo lo que has ido recogiendo por el camino. Así que se trata de decidir entre seguir adelante por un botín mayor, con riesgo de fracasar estrepitosamente, o retirarse a tiempo asegurando lo que has obtenido.

Divertido y sencillo. Aunque creo que se quemaría rápido. Es para sacar de vez en cuando y desempalagar ^^

RATING: 4
I feel like I should like this game, but it usually just ends up as a total bore.  The decisions are pretty obvious, and it's almost always the best choice just to stay in until you're the last person left, because one big payout can win you the game.  There are definitely MUCH better push-your-luck games (like Cloud 9).

RATING: 8
This has turned out to be very popular within my circle of friends/neighbors/family. An excellent push-your-luck game with pretty gemstone bits, quick play, no turns to take (important with 8 players!) and a decent theme. Simple to teach and even the six-year-olds understand it well enough to play on their own. The Star-Telegram had it all wrong with this one - this one is a winner for social, friendly gaming.

Played the Incan Gold version. Decent filler, but with many players it seems like it's easy for one player to jump out to an insurmountable lead in the early rounds. Once the lead has been established, everyone else is forced to stay as long as possible, diluting the loot available to them and making it extremely risky to catch up.

[size=12][b]Why I like Diamant:[/b][/size]
+ I like pure push your luck games because they are excellent filler game. In terms of light games I vastly prefer push your luck games over deduction games.
+ The game is easy to teach
+ The game is short
+ There is high player involvement

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Diamant:[/b][/size]
- There are hardly any meaningful decisions to make as several aspects to the game are random. I only ignore this issue in regards to push your luck games because the focus of the game is luck.
- There could be better replayability. I think that this game could be integrated into another more complex game.

This gets old fast.  It's all random chance.  Has that gambling feel.  "am I lucky?"  when it's all random chance.  I'm sure folks have studied the optimal payperplay.  But.. even that wouldn't make it better.  It's really really really chance based and boring.  This got one play and then has never been unearthed by anyone else again.

De los juegos favoritos de mi sobrino, es simple pero me gusta lo de arriesgarse para conseguir más diamantes le da mucha miga al juego y no es mala opción para sacar de vez en cuando con gente poco jugona. A mi me funciona muy bien con unas cervecitas de por medio para pasar el rato y como pueden jugar hasta 8 personas se puede sacar para grupos grandes, cosa muy positiva en mi caso particular.

Works well if there are enough players (more than four). If you like push-your-luck -games this is for you, I don't. I'm ready to play it, but I don't need to own it. 
This one is definitely over-produced game: Amigo should make small card-game version and price should be like 4-5 euros. That's why you should buy 'Inca gold' instead.

Incan Gold is a quick, fun and tense game in which you and other adventurers explore an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure. In each of the five rounds, you secretly choose if you want to continue exploring the temple in search of more treasure or retreat to the safety of your camp with your share of the treasure that has been discovered so far.

Ultra light, filler-worthy game that supports up to 8 players, plays very fast and is trivial to teach.  Works very well with non gamer crowds and is simple enough to survive a fairly beer and pretzel approach.  It has a nice, push-your-luck element combined with some interesting double-blind bluffing.  Won't really fly in a gamer context but worth having in a collection.

A neat little push-your-luck game that plays up to 8 and it's simple enough to classify under the feather-weight category.  Serves excellently for a party-type game and a great light psych-game for cons or large groups.  Incan Gold as a few extra artifact cards not found in original Diamant.  This plays best with large numbers up to 8.

Played only on BSW.  See my User Review.

UPDATE: I've played this a lot in a short amount of time, so I have burned out on it some.  The opinions I present in my review still stand, but I'm dropping my rating a point simply because a game like this can't maintain it's luster through heavy repeat play, at least for me.  Still a very good game for it's category, however.

UPDATE: I still play this with some regularity on BSW, and so I'd have to call this the best filler not called Liar's Dice.  I've bumped my rating to 8.

Disappointed. Too much fiddling with the cards. I do enjoy press your luck games though and this one is no exception. Just didn't stand up to all the hype for me.

RATING: 8
The beauty of the game is its simplicity.  Even though the only decision you have to make each round is whether to continue exploring the cave or flee with your gems, that one decision can be a really tough one.  As far as press your luck games go, this is by far my favorite.  It takes only one minute to explain the rules, and only 15 minutes to play, yet it is loads of fun.  Everyone I've played it with has liked it.

Doesn't require much thought.  Good starting-the-night game.  You just perpetually keep deciding: go further, or take the money and run.  There really isn't any strategy.  You're either running the statistics in your head, or you're going on gut instinct.  Ultimately, the winner is based on luck.

RATING: 6
Excellent filler, although it wears out its welcome relatively quickly.  This is a pure push-your-luck game, and as such, there is little in the way of strategy.  The early goings of each round are rather unsuspenseful, but the tension rachets up quickly as more cards are laid down.  It seems that it's pretty easy to get busted in this game, which may encourage more conservative play than what would provide the most fun.  This is a game that can be played a max of twice in a night.  Any more than that and it gets a little old and tired.
UPDATE:  Played this with 8 for the first time.  The gameplay improves dramatically with that number.  The tension mounts quickly as much more treasure (I have Incan Gold) is left in the temples.  It becomes more tempting to leave earlier, but there is a lot of second-guessing.  The decision as to when to leave is not all about how much treasure is in front of you, but about how much treasure you can pick up on the way out.  I like the addition of the artifacts in Incan Gold.  It makes for some other interesting decisions, because only if you leave the temple alone can you take an artifact.  For 8 players, this is an "8" for me, especially because there aren't a lot of good games for 8 players.  I'll keep my rating at a "6," however, for groups of 6 and fewer.

I like this game better than the '6' rating might indicate. It's a great large-group quick-entry filler game, and I use it with kids or non-gamers all the time. Acting as moderator, I can have people playing right away. As such, it's a mainstay of my collection and frequently travels to game day events.

All that said, it's not one I'm going to push to play, because for all of the things that it does well, I don't find the decisions all that interesting.

My plays of this are of the slight variant Diamant.  This is always good for the end of a gaming session or a break from meatier games.  The tension from deciding to stay or go is sweet but it plays quickly enough that bad luck (which is a big part) doesn't make for a bad experience.  In fact, it is kind of fun, being the one who HAS to push his luck further in order to catch up, even if you generally end up dying horribly.

A simple press your luck filler game.  It is a game that anyone can quickly learn.  I would view it almost as a party game it is so light and easy to play.  You flip a card and if it has gems you divide amongst all player and leave remainders on the card.  You then decide to stay or go.  If two disasters of the same type come up, you lose everything you have gained.  If you run away, you get your gems and the remainder that is left. 

Simple and fun.  I think everyone should own this game.  It is a great filler.

Traded away for Aquire. I'm glad it's gone.

I discovered that we played incorrectly the first time out so now the push-your-luck element is stronger. Might be fun to play this for real money.

I still don't think the commercial version of this game is worth buying as it is just way too expensive for what it is and there are better games to be had for the same or less.

I'll make my own when my kid gets old enough to work on division.

30 cards:
15 Diamond Cards - 1,2,3,4,5,5,7,7,9,11,11,13,14,15,17
15 Danger Cards - 3 each of Explosion, Gas, Snake, Scorpion, Cave In

This game is a filler in the truest sense of the term. It's not a game I'd pull off the shelf to play by itself - it's only something I'd play to fill a gap of time at a game day, either waiting for more people to turn up, between bigger games, or to wind down the evening. It combines the push-your-luck of Blackjack with a small amount of bluffing a la 5 card draw poker - as a filler this game is interesting in short bursts, but it won't satisfy as the main event. Of course, as a filler, it's worth picking up if you need something that 8 players can play in 20 minutes.

Another fun little filler. Easy to teach, and can appeal to a wide range of gamers and non-gamers alike. There is a very enjoyable theme that works well with the mechanics. It does not over stay it's welcome either. There is plenty of replay-ability here. The components are serviceable, nothing fancy. It isn't flashy and could use a good makeover to bring it into the modern era of board/card gaming. But functionally everything works well and is simple to grasp, fun and quick. The push your luck element is good for some funny moments, and laughs.

Kids like this, and it's fun to play with mixed ages.

Adding little treasure trinkets for the artifact variant is essential. The board (available for printing) is unnecessary but nice.

Incan Gold made two improvements to Diamant: 1. Official adoption of the [thread=64581]artifact variant[/thread], including distinct treasure art. 2. A less ambiguous indicator for continue/exit.

This game was very enjoyable. The artwork and bits are really nice. There is a fun, but noticeable tension in each turn as you decide whether or not to continue exploring.

I found game play to be very two-dimensional. This is more a game of chance than skill and a more conservative gambler will beat a high-risk taker mor often than not.

Have Incan Gold version.  Played several times.  Tons of fun for a light "press-your-luck" game.  To keep things moving, I think it's better to just have one "shuffler/dealer" (rather than shifting the roll around each round).  Have someone else be the "banker" (distribute gems) and you'll be able to fit in more games.  You'll want to play various times if your group gets into it.

An easy pick-up-and-go game — both that you grab-n-go but also you can just open it up and play even from the first outing. Simple, tile-laying, press-your-luck game without much else to it, but strangely satisfying. The components are excellent — the Indiana Jones meeples and actual treasure chests really make for a nice tactile experience. A game plays quickly, it’s easy to set up and put away, and it’s fun enough to play that it doesn’t really seem to matter who wins, because (usually) everybody gets some treasure. In the treasure box. And that’s neat.

Played Incan Gold a couple times and found it fun.  Sometimes it's just pushing your luck, sometimes it's more about predicting your opponents' decisions.  Either way, there's not an awful lot of strategery involved, so the game moves quickly.  The excitement of the huge wins and sudden losses seems to make up for the over-dependence on luck; despite the fact that the game's playing you a bit more than you're playing it, you still have a lot of fun.  It's not one I'll want to play when I'm in a serious gaming mood, but it's a good warm-up or end-of-the-night game.

Now this game was something else. Probably the best game I have ever had of Incan Gold. 

My son had a sleepover for his birthday (seems to be a modern invention that is becoming a kind of rites of passage for very young kids ... never had them in my day, it was just a natural occurrance when you got left behind at a party your parents had been too! ). Any way we had a group of about 8-10 8 year olds staying over for the night, the next morning my wife had to pop out for a while and left me alone with the horde ... I needed to think of something and think of it quick before Lord of the Flies type carnage descended on us all.

Out came Incan Gold my trusted friend ...

... and it has still never let me down. The game went down a treat with the kids screaming and shouting and that was just over the maths of calculating how many jewels to share out and what to leave on the path! The kids formed a band (with my middle daughter on saxophone) to play a musical accompaniment to the numerous copies of Mrs. Doyle who had sprung up encouraging everyone to go on. 



They even had an intermission from the game to work on the "Go On" song. It was hilarious watching them all sing along as we were choosing our cards to indicate go on further or run back to the tent. You could see in the eye's of one or two of them that they were panicking about the possibility of a second snake or spider turning up and grabbing them and this then turning to joy when, upon revealing the cards, everyone else had been swayed by the masses and ran headlong into the outstretched arms of a newly revealed second mummy whilst they returned to their tent triumphantly sweeping up all the jewels on the pathway back before them.

Just such a good game. I have had many requests from parents asking which game this was ... just fantastic fun.

Previously owned this game.  Played a few times, but very tiresome with non-gamers.  Okay, now flip your card back over, do it again, again, etc.  A real chore to keep the game going - maybe Diamant has a better mechanic to do this, but I'm worn out on it.  Traded in Math Trade for Louis XIV.

A push your luck game best played with at least 6 people.  Quick and easy, good filler and able to be explained very easily and quickly to all levels of gamers. 

The game is as good as the attitudes of the players playing.  With few decisions, the enjoyment is in the interactions of the players and good natured taunting and encouragement makes the flip of the cards just that much more exciting

A good filler with a Push Your Luck mechanism. The game can be very funny if played with 5+ players. One thing I don´t like in this game is that sometimes you have only one or two treasure cards when the second danger appears. The round becomes frustrating.  Unfortunately, this happens too much for my tastes. The game has potential to provide real fast fun. One stroke of genius is the relic cards. I would never play without it.

(9/17) Drop to 7. This maybe should rise again, it's just SUCH a pure press your luck game, absolutely wonderful.  Perhaps it's the fact that that is ALL that there is to this.  There's also a little bit of a runaway leader issue which can lead to some anticlimactic later rounds, but still...fantastic game.

I like the "push your luck" mechanic if done correctly, and it is done correctly in this light filler here.  Not only do you have to measure out the expected return of staying in the mine versus having the tunnel come crashing down on your head, but the bluffing over the residual gems on the return trip out of the mine makes for a juicy dilemma.

A very fun "push your luck" game. There is a huge reward to be the only adventurer left and treasure comes out. More often than not however the one that pushes their luck too long ends up getting caught in a hazard.

Just tried the artifacts.  They are a nice interseting addition.

We added Indiana Jones Lego figures to make the game more like the original Diamant because droping meeples is more fun than flipping a card.

I've heard so much about this game, and even watched the videos, but even with the videos I didn't really think much of it.  But when I saw Chris teaching this to 1 of the tables yesterday, I was like YAH I want to try this.

Tried it and loved it! I played it with Steve & Yannis and it was a blast!  They looked like they were having fun also.  It's a great push your luck game, and trying to out think your opponents.  We often ended up thinking alike, I think I just won by 1 point.  I'd totally play this again, it was hilarious.  I think it was because the way Chris taught the game.  I want a copy of Incan Gold now :)

Here are the things I like about Incan Gold.
- It can play up to 8 players.
- There's always someone to root for and someone to root against, and there's always someone rooting for or against you.
- The artifacts present a double-thinking aspect that's fun.
- Each round has slightly higher odds of scoring big than previous rounds.


Here are the things I don't like about Incan Gold:
- If a player banks a significant lead, they likely have already won the game.
- All those little gems have to get moved around each turn. Someone needs to play banker, basically.
- Often, a round ends before it hardly even gets interesting. A matching hazard card will come out and finish the round when everyone has 4 points.

I thought it was fine on BSW, but have the feeling it'd be rather blah face-to-face.  Feels like something to do while waiting for a better game to open up...the type of game I wouldn't mind quitting in the middle.  Edit: having now played face to face, I can say that it is pretty "blah."  I hate how quickly the caves can end -- too many disaster cards and too few gems to make it deliciously tense.

01/17/17 I played four games of 2P Incan Gold. My impression of Incan Gold after playing it was about the same as right after I heard its rules. Its a fair filler game, that *really* needs at least three players. So my initial outing tonight with only two lost some of its flavor, as expected. Therefore I rated it a "5" on BGG. That might go up 
if/when I play it with more people. But overall the "push your luck" mechanic is not one of my favorites. So I can't ever see myself rating it more than a 6. To me Incan Gold is almost a party type games. A type I try to avoid. 
- 01/31/17 I played two 5P games of Incan Gold. The game owner assured me it was much better with 3 to 8. The game was better with more. Yet not enough of an improvement to raise it rating on BGG.  For you only make one decision each round, stay or go. And that's not enough to hold my interest for long. Yes, its just a 
filler. But I've played many fillers with much more going on, that make them 
hold up over repeated play. So my rating of "5" stands. 
- 03/21/17 I played one more 5P game of Incan Gold. 
Around this time the Incan Gold entry on BGG was merged into the Diamant entry, as they are virtually the same game. Alas all my above comments and rating then went Poof!.  Only I didn't know that until November. 
- 11/22/17 I did my best to recreate them.
- 11/23/17 Now my collections shows two Diamant entries. I blame the BGG Admins continuing to do loopy things with Incan Gold / Diamant.  Akk! So I deleted the oldest one.

Initial rating: Nice little "push your luck" filler. Fun if you're into that. Fast gameplay, good for starters or just a quick game. Definitely not a gamer's game, but good in bigger groups, the more the merrier, and the harder it gets to win on tactics...

Update after lots of plays: this one is definitely a winner with "non-gamers".

NL: Jij en je medespelers zijn op diamantjacht in de mijnen. Neem je je buit mee terug omhoog voordat de mijn instort of durf je die diamant die verderop ligt ook nog even mee te nemen?

Cute and easy game for kids.  They can play at being brave and chickening out.  You can use it to teach some very light math and probabilities.  Simple giggles.    The addition of artifacts makes it a little more interesting.  I raised my rating based on more family play.

I bought this specifically to teach to my 6 year old daughter, and it's certainly a hit with her.  After several plays she is now dividing up the gems for us,learning the difference between odd and even numbers, and actually making a couple of shrewd moves of when she heads back to camp instead of continuing to explore - she's beaten us more than half the times we've played. She is facinated with the artifacts - but does not like the snake cards one bit (too SCARY Daddy!)  My wife and I have a blast playing it with her, but I don't know if this is something I would break out with a group of adults - there are so many other "filler" games I'd rather play.

Very accessible push-your-luck game that almost all ages can enjoy. (2015-06-21)

Update: Played with only three people (after buying it for Christmas for each of my brothers), and the game fell flat!  I am guessing you need 5 or 6 poeple to really feel the magic with this one. (2016-01-04)

RATING: 5.5
Well, I like the risk-taking aspect of the game, but it might have been pushed a little too far. The ridiculous variance in the card value means that one or two lone adventurers pushing their luck can automatically win the game with some luck. I like the fact that the undivisible gems remain on the board to be picked up by escaping dwarves; it definitely adds an interesting layer to the decisions to be taken. A fairly quick filler, but for some reason it's missing that little "something" and leaves me on my appetite.

RATING: 6
I like this game.  It is no great challenge to your mental faculties, but quick and fun to play with the kids or non-gamers.  This is a game my kids can play and win.  One of my daughters loves this game, but I think it is because it is so luck based that she has a real shot at winning more than she likes the game.  It is a great looking game though for what you get.  Lowered my rating to 6 because it is just too luck oriented.

A fun press your luck game that's really just playing the odds once again.  However, this one has a great theme and it's intense not knowing what dangers lurk around the corner.  The big question is take the money and run or search for more treasure.  I like the fact that once others escape the cave (for safety) your share of the treasure increases, unless you hit a hazard, as you only split the treasures with those brave enough to remain in the cavern.

Fun, light, and quick.  I can readily see the appeal as a party game / game for non-gamers.  Decisions are easy, and a single turn is all that is required for understanding the trade-off principles ("If I stay in longer, I'll get a larger share!").  The little gems of "Incan Gold" english version puts me off some, but otherwise the play is well done.

* Lavishly produced press-your-luck game
* Excellent with more, and can be a raucously good time with the right group
* Game takes about 5 minutes to teach with no downtime
* Those who never leave can upset the game's balance, but usually finish first or last

* Like most games, has burnout potential if played too often
* Lack of any deep decisions make this a beginning/end of game day filler at best

Diamant is a simple "push-your-luck" game where players play adventurers seeing gems and riches in five different mines. Each turn, players decide whether they want to continue the expedition and delve further into the mine or bail out and leave with whatever treasure they have acquired thus far. Of course, it wouldn't be fun if there wasn't any danger involved. There are hazards in the mines as well. There are scorpions, snakes, poison gas, cave-ins and explosions that the brave explorers will encounter. If players are in the mine after two of the same hazard cards come up then they die and lose any gems they have acquired.

This game is quite simple and plays fairly quick. It's easy to explain and is quite exciting to play. It definitely surpassed my expectation of a game with such a simple mechanic. Players susceptible to trying to push their luck will find this game a lot of fun and entertaining. No deep strategies involved, however decisions will sometimes get tough. Recommended for a light, filler type game that produces lot of laughs.

RATING: 6
Push your luck for most treasure.

Plays: A couple.
Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most).
Complexity: Family game = a game that is easy to teach and play.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Competition for unlimited resources.
Randomness: Medium – card draw, but cards affect all players equally.

Replayability: High. It’s very quick so why not go again?
Fun: Definitely. Each step into the temple is exciting. Tension rises as more threats are revealed. Getting away with the artifacts is fun. Timing your exit just before the temple collapses is fun.
Memorability: Low, it’s a VP race that doesn’t create stories.

Thematic integration: Decent. The art does a good job communicating the theme.
Components: Pretty! Very good for such a cheap game. The player tents are a nice touch.

Who will like this: Large families.

RATING: 6
Fun, quick push your luck game for up to 8 players. Feels almost party game-ish.

Getting diminishing returns with this one. Sometimes the cards come up in such a way that things are not very interesting. Games often have at least one round where everyone's in the temple with 2 or 3 gems when the second disaster hits. Also when someone jumps out to a lead, the game gets formulaic and stale as the decisions become obvious: Got a big lead? Play it safe. Far behind? Well, you've gotta play it risky. At this point players are simply at the mercy of the cards.

There are still games of Incan Gold that are fun and filled with tension, but they are infrequent.

An awesome filler/party game.  If the truth be told, this game is mostly luck.  By counting cards and playing probabilities, you can make the most rational choice.

A very small box and tiny rules book hides an addictive gambling/push your luck game. Makes a great filler or end of the night game as it requires little effort to play. Suspect it plays best with more players rather then less (goes up to 8 players but this could equally be teams if you had a LOT of people)- still great with less too though! Small box, big fun.

Short, fairly random push-your-luck game. The rewards of risky play generally outweigh the consequences of losing your bet, just because they are so large (getting a 15-gem card and not having to divvy it up with anyone is great!).

That said, the game feels like it could have used more careful design that didn't make a lot of the expeditions frustrating or pointless: it's just not fun having a bunch of trap cards turn up right at the start, quickly terminating the trip. Too often, play becomes automatic (e.g. say you draw a low-value gem card then a series of traps--there's literally no point where any player has an incentive to turn back, so it's a bunch of automatic "continue" votes and then a bomb when the 2nd trap is drawn). Every so often there's an amazing high-risk adventure where people gradually drop out and someone keeps pushing their luck--but that's not as often as I'd like. -- Also this is one of those games where there is perfect information that is half-disguised by keeping winnings out of sight, so anyone who can track the winnings will often be playing on auto-pilot in the last round since they know exactly how many points everyone needs to win.

I enjoy this game as a nice easy filler. All new players to board games can grasp it and it's a nice easy 'reel them in' kind of game.

I don't think I've ever won Incan gold, doubt I ever will as I push my luck too far and I have no luck other than bad luck.

But despite that I picked this game up nice and cheap and I look forward to playing it with my friends.

Diamant is the quintessential push your luck game. Adventures head into a cave and face traps, treasure or relics, which are shown on cards. After each card is revealed, adventure take any required actions and decide whether to carry on, or leave. If they leave on their own they can collect any relics that have been uncovered and all remaining treasure, if they leave with others then relics are left and the remaining loot is split equally. Why would you leave? Well the first time you see a trap of a certain type you are ok, but if that trap type comes out again you flee the cave and get nothing! Including treasure you have already collected on that run! Awesome little game with great components including cardboard treasure chests to store your banked treasures in!

Arguably the most distilled form of 'push your luck' available, Incan gold plays many with its simultaneous turn structure and provided plenty of incentive to drop out and to stay in at your own risk. Highly recommended.

I own the Incan Gold version and it has quickly become the favourite filler game to end a long day of heavy gaming. 

The game play offers a simple proposition, 'Will you test your luck again in the pursuit of riches?' This tantalising dare combined with simultaneous turns, a play time of 10-15 minutes and the option to play up to 8 people make this game a winner on every front!

However if you like good looking games I would by the Diamant version.

RATING: 7
A push your luck filler in the same box size as the Kosmos 2-Player collection. 

Each turn the players must decide if they will push deeper into the temple in search of greater fortune or pull out in the hope of getting a share of the spoils, which is only possible if those that push on end up coming to grieve.

Coming to grieve occurs when a danger card is drawn. There are several types of danger cards in the deck and pulling one of these of a certain type is fine if it is the first...but not if it is the second of its type.

Thus the game is revealed...the players have limited information but are never sure of what is lurking around the next corner!

The game is played over a series of 5 rounds, one for each level of the temple. 

A really clever game.

I'm not the biggest fan of the game - but it's a huge hit with family members, it's quick and always seems to be tabled at family functions.  Because of these factors it has grown on me.

Diamant plays very quickly and has just enough decision making and tension to be fun while being dead simple to learn and play. Another good push-your-luck styles game that scales well from 3 players on up. Whether to take the safe jewel stashes or risk it and head deeper into the mines is always a fun decision and the fact you may split the loot with others makes the decision making that much more tricky and even agonizing at times. Great game play for such a simple concept.

Push your luck game where you either decide to return (and collect all treasures found so far) or draw another card, running the risk of drawing a bad card (and lose all treasures found so far). Very little room for strategy (what's the probability of drawing a bad card?) and interaction (should I take a bigger risk to catch up or play safe?) makes Incan Gold a pretty dull game.

主題:1
利用冒險尋寶，面對未知的陷阱來考驗人性貪婪的主題性強烈遊戲，主題與遊戲規則能相呼應。

美術:0.6
本遊戲是個小品遊戲，盒子外殼很厚，外加寶石籌碼是實物不是紙板，還算可取之處。美工及其他的部分只能說堪稱及格。

規則:1
規則簡單，好講解，小朋友一聽就懂，基本上就是一個字"賭"，賭運氣、賭膽識，不過喜歡策略的人可能會覺得沒有深度。
遊戲過程就是先看看場面上發現的寶石有多少，玩家決定要不要返回營地，獲得自己的寶石；或者決定繼續冒險，贏取更多寶藏，又或者發先災難空手而回。就怎麼簡單。

設置:1 好設置，洗一洗冒險牌庫，每人各發一張前進或者後退的卡片就好了。是入門遊戲中好教學好設置的遊戲。

路線:0.2
本遊戲路線只有兩種，前進或後退。難怪大人會不喜歡，但是小孩超愛。不過要玩的有深度，勉強可以將災難卡的發生率放進決策過程中，或許可以增加一點遊戲深度。

互動:1
本遊戲在路線上得分落後，但是在玩家互動中得到最高分，假如真的拿這款遊戲來賭錢，我想連大人都會被這款遊戲征服。遊戲中的互動產生在大家返回營地時拿取的寶石或者是神器，每一個抉擇，都考驗著人性。

個人:0.4
剛開開這款遊戲，覺得很刺激，但隨著開的次數越多，越覺得本款遊戲深度不足，個人只有在推廣桌遊時，當作推抗工具。除非真的玩錢，不然個人不會為想玩這個遊戲而開。

朋友:0.7
小朋友絕對愛的遊戲，每次小孩開這款遊戲都很投入，大人反應普普。

想玩:0.2
沒有深度，只能教入門。

收藏:0.6
雖然個人覺得本遊戲不夠深度，但做為推廣桌遊的遊戲，這款遊戲倒是很棒，另外賭博的機制也是桌遊少見的遊戲方式，看在價格上還是可以收藏。

總分:6.7
講評:本遊戲反應兩極，就看個人的喜愛程度了。

Despite the simple mechanics, this game has been a huge hit in my family. It's surprisingly intense watching the cards get revealed and seeing what happens. There's also a lot of bluffing and deduction in Incan Gold because you can often get a bonus if you correctly guess what the others are going to do.

But it can't be denied that this game is highly luck-based so a strategy gamer will probably hate this!

A game this simple shouldn't be so fun. The only choice you have is essentially stick or gamble. Someone (to my chagrin) pointed out it's actually quite similar to 'Deal or No Deal' but dressed up with a Meso-American theme. Which is a shame... but I can look past that. It's a great little game balancing risk and reward, whilst trying to guess what your opponents will do.

Deck of 30 cards composed of 15 disasters (five different types, three cards each) and fifteen numbers ranging from 1 to 17. In a round, flip a card. If it is a number card, all explorers present split the gems; if it is a disaster card, no one is in danger unless it is the second copy of the same disaster. Everyone then loses their gems. Players have the option of retreating back to base camp before the next card is drawn and splitting the leftover gems left on cards, and having the privilege of banking their gems. Play over five rounds. A cute little game that plays quickly. If you gamble and win, it's fun, if you lose, it's still fun.

Reprint of Diamant, where players are adventurerers, trying to get treasure and avoid disasters. The difference from Diamant is that there is a reward for being the only one to leave first.

Light gateway push your luck for high player counts of 3-8 and works well at those counts

Fails at 7p so I suspect 8p fails too. 3-6 or 3-5 is prob the sweet spot but this is a big hit with my friends' groups, though I personally dont care for it.

I think for a Push Your Luck, it needs to scale at 7 and 8 somehow, like removing dangers or increasing money values.

Basically a game of how far you are willing to push your luck, made very tense by the way the scoring is split as people drop out as each expedition into the temple goes on, and by the special case of the treasure cards that crop up.

While I enjoy this game a hell of a lot, I would probably only suggest it with non-gamers and family, since it is such a simple mechanic and requires little investment in the way of time or rules learning. However, if other gamers suggest it I can't see myself ever turning down a game.

While this game uses a push-your-luck system like Can't Stop, I would recommend Diamant if you're the shady sort of gamer who, (like yours truly) prefers a thick coating of theme. While not an elaborate theme by any means; you're exploring these 5 caves for gems, as you advance, dangers may befall you and if you should encounter more than 1 danger, you must retreat from that cave and lose all gems collected - it does work. There's a tangible satisfaction which accompanies plonking  the pretty gem bits in your little old-skool shipping container. There just is. 

Another fun thing about this game is that cowards can win big! Running before everyone else out of the cave means that you collect all the gems that were rounded out during distribution when going into the cave. Perfect if there's someone cocky that you'd like to humble, hee.

A very simple Push-Your-Luck game. Temple turn cards and tents are an effort to give this game some more value and distract players from the fact that all you really are doing is giving a single yes/no answer each turn. This same game could be played with pennies and a regular deck of cards.

The turquoise treasure pieces look like Gushers fruit snacks, so if you are looking, over the course of the game you will catch players eying them hungrily.

After trying this, No Thanks!, and For Sale, I think I want more out of my games than these light fillers. There is just not enough 'game' to them.

Very light push-your-luck game that exploits the tension created by the simultaneous decisions. Almost no setup time and very short games that make up for the lack of strategic decisions. 
Up to 8 players, and preferably played with 4+.

RATING: 7.4
Diamant is a very basic push your luck game that can be learnt in one minute and played in 10. It's been deprived of all the accessory to provide a pure push your luck experience.

The production is good. The art is mediocre, but the boxes and gems are great (even if sometimes there are not enough of them).

But the gameplay is really fun. It's luck, but your decisions are very important. There's a mathematical basis in all the decisions, but the decisions of the other players will matter almost as much, and they are simultaneous.

RATING: 8
It's a typical push-your-luck game but with a good theme. Simple to play and short. I've played with 3 to 6 players and it is very flexible with number of players and feels to be quite playable even up to whole 8 players. Flow of the game will change a bit as more diamonds are left on the path with more players. Making timing of your exit even more important. One of the best games in pure push-your-luck genre.

Tom Vasel ha inserito questo gioco (giochino) nella sua speciale classifica dei 100 più divertenti giochi. Ho il sospetto che io e Tom non abbiamo proprio gli stessi gusti. Incan Gold è infatti a mio avviso un gioco di una banalità irritante. Intendiamoci, quando ci ho giocato mi sono anche divertito per via di una compagnia adatta e predisposta, ma mi sarei divertito in egual misura probabilmente giocando a carta-forbice-sasso. Il gioco ha delle dinamiche simili all'esempio fatto anche se si può giocare fino a 8. Simultaneamente ognuno sceglie una carta tra le due carte in mano che permetterà di esplorare il tempio o scappare con i tesori; in caso a scappare siano più giocatori i bottini andranno divisi mentre chi è rimasto potrà trovare nuovi tesori o carte 'morte'. Elementare intuire che l'ideale sarebbe riuscire a scappare da soli nel momento in cui c'è un bel gruzzoletto sperando poi nella morte degli altri.

Thank you BGG for the recomendation. I got this gane for my 8yr old cousins and myself...we played this over christmas and it was a hit

we had 2 of our "adult" relatives that kepts getting up to do other stuff, and that took away from the game a bit, but despite that it was still AWESOME. This this makes an EXCELLENT game for ANY crowd (as long as they can actually sit still for 20 minutes)

If you've ever played "toss ups" the dice game, this is very similar but executed 100 times better...the only place toss ups is better is it if you're at a loud party, you're really board, and you have at least one cool friend with you.

A great game for a large group.  Each turn you have to weigh up whether to advance and hope to find more gems or head back to camp to bank the ones you've already collected.  Tension builds as players push their luck and it is very satisfying when you make the right choice and it pays off big.  Lots of fun! I have a home-made version.

Great game for complete non-gamers. Also good for children...if their parents have no objections to teaching little kids light gambling.

Good for teaching division as well.

We play the following variant:
If a card with gems is revealed, all the gems are piled onto that card; they are NOT divided up and piled up outside everyone's tents.

You only get gems if you decide to leave, at which point you divide up all of the gems that are in the temple so far. Now the question changes from, "Should I keep my (a+b+c)/n?" to "If I leave now, what will k be in (a+b+c)/k?"

I'm not sure if this is better, but this game isn't strategic anyway. This is a filler.

[b]Incan Gold*[/b] was traded away for Jambo 3/31/14. 

[i]Fun, quick filler that plays up to 8. I bought this to play at family get togethers or a quick open to family game nights in our house and it works great for this purpose. This game is just a simple, yet addictive push your luck game. My only gripe is the component quality is not that good, but for the $ of the game it can be overlooked.

[i]Originally owned Incan gold but the component quality was just okay. The card quality was not that good, and the fold up tents stunk. Also every game we played multiple people would get confused with the cards used to show whether you were leaving or staying. I ended up trading Incan Gold and got a copy of [thing=15512][/thing]. This has remained one of our go to push your luck games, especially when we have friends and family over.[/i]

[i]- Fun, quick filler that plays up to 8. 
- This game is easy to teach/learn; we have brought this to family get togethers and had a lot of fun playing with our extended families. 
- This game can be an addictive push your luck game. 
- The components for Diamant are absolutely amazing (diamonds for the gems, cool boxes for the gems and little Indiana Jones meeples)[/i].

This game always has my wife giddy with anticipation; she loves to get the treasure. Unfortunately for her, she can't stop searching and inevitably gets buried in a bunch of rubble. But, the Zombiesque character will always scare her right out of the temple. As a 2-player game I seem to win...alot! We have now played this with more people and it has been a success. Mostly because of its quick play time and fun factor!

Why is this game better than Incan Gold? I don't know; maybe its the bits or maybe its more of a tomb raiding feel to game play...whatever it is this is a great game for 2-8 players!

We've only played two player with a third player option we house-ruled in.  (We used a polyhedral, forget what size, and depending on the roll and how far in, the dice would determine if the ghost player backed out or not.)

A worthy 20 min push-your-luck play-the-odds filler for large crowds of 6 to 8. We've moved to the 'balls of steel' variant, where all gems stay on the mines (ie not evenly distributed), which has produced much more groan and hilarity. There's more importance on out-guessing the other players now rather than the cards. Anyway, it's still coming out occasionally after all these years because it's a niche winner.

RATING: 7
A remake of Diamant so it gets the same rating as the original, in that it's a worthy 20min push-your-luck play-the-odds filler, especially for larger crowds of 6 to 8. We usually employ the 'balls of steel' variant, where all gems stay on the mines (ie not evenly distributed), which has produced much groan and hilarity, and places more importance on out-guessing the other players now rather than the cards. This edition is probably better than the original because of the addition of artifacts which, when they appear, offer 5pts to anyone who manages to pull out when no one else does. Which obviously gives more to double-out-think-yourself over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I have the IG version.  The game is fine enough, but the 'card tents' are lame.  The parts are surely better in Diamant vs IG, but I don't think it takes away from the game.  This is an excellent game to teach anyone, even kids.

This was being played as an end of night game by a group at my games club, as we were on the last knockings of some deep tactical game; the noise and laughter was a bit off putting, but I was intrigued as to what game was causing this response. Having found out I played Incan Gold next week. I thoroughly enjoyed the game.

Having played the game a few more times with different groups of people, and having compared notes with others, it seems this game is dependant on the group playing it. If the group get into the game and egg each other on to stay or leave the expedition the fun is increased greatly.

This is a light push-your-luck-style filler game.  Its main advantage is that it can accommodate up to eight players without bogging down at all.

TRY Feb/05 (BSW): Good fun!  Can't Stop + group think; fun, but can unbalance when 1 remaining explorer rakes in a HUGE treasure room.  It is good & quick, though.

Aug/05: Ah, I see from pictures that the game includes explorers + beautiful, full-colour treasure boxes!  A nice touch; unnecessary, but certainly cost-adding and theme-adding.  I'll likely get it -- it IS a lot of fun on BSW, plays quick, and plays with 4-8 players.  The thematic pieces would help suck in non-/semi-gamers.

Apr/08: Has turned into a favourite game day starter.

This game is way too random: a round could be over in 2 turns or 15 and there's no real indication of more danger. Furthermore, when you are behind, you're only way to catch up is pushing your luck (very) far, leaving few tough decisions.

Guess what this one is sth you will like for sure no matter what. Plays with 8 max, so can be a party game but also with 3 or 4 can be the same entertaining. For what it is, its a gem!

Changing again to a 5: It is not a bad game, but it is just good for a very limited time. Bad replay ability.

It's great game for anyone gamer or non-gamer but it's boring!
Of course it's exciting to find out whether you take a larger pot than currently, but somehow it still feels that it can be contributed to in no way!
Feels as if game plays itself and we just pay for it. And by the way, it's too expensive in comparison to insides of the box.

I've played quite a lot in BSW. It's better there than on board.

Card game.  Push your luck fun!  Simple, quick game.  Go deeper into the temple and split new treasure with your adventuring group or leave and be assured of keeping your present loot.

(01/18) It can fit up to 8 people and it is crazy easy to teach, it takes the Press your Luck concept and makes it clear for new players.

RATING: 7
(10+ plays)  A push your luck game where turns are simultaneous.  Great design!  A few too many games have fallen flat, so I'm not sure how long this one will last.  Some games are a nail biting game of chicken, with tough decisions and dramatic reveals.  Can be a total blast!  Other games can be so anti-climatic, especially if multiple rounds are really bad luck.

"Reveal first card of first round.  Spider.  Second card.   Zombie.  Third card. Cave-In.  Fourth card.  Zombie.  OK.  We've been chased out of the temple by zombies.  So we go to round 2."
new players... stunned
"Wait, what just happened?"
"Um, well, that's not normal, just hang with me here...."
When the whole game goes nearly this bad (and some do)... it is hard to recover the new players to let them see the magic this game can be.

A great, simple "push your luck" game where players take their turns simultaneously (no down-time between turns).
Inter-player interaction is on the low side from a mechanics stand point, but there is a LOT of interaction in the form of psyching each other out with, "I'm leaving this turn. I swear! You don't believe me?".

This game goes great with beer... cause that's usually how we've played it.

Multiple plays: A good gateway game because it is so simple and easy to teach.  Also can play up to 8 people.  My blasted tunnels always end too fast though.  It is great when you are the only one daring enough to advance further and you hit a big payout.

On order from GameSurplus - June 4 06
Arrived - June 14th.  Great service from these guys. www.gamesurplus.com

Update:  Upon further inspection, I realized that the game did not come with a starting mat.  I wrote to the publisher, who was very prompt in shipping a replacement mat to me overseas.  Thanks for excellent service!

Update:  I keep bringing this game to social functions, thinking that /someone/ will get excited about the neat bits and quick gameplay.. but noone seems interested!  Gah!  I WILL PLAY THIS GAME.

Update:  I did.  No matter how many people dog this game, it will always be a superb one for me.  In truth, it is extremely overproduced, but it's exactly that which makes it so desireable.  It's a fun push-your-luck game that can be taught in 10 minutes and played in the same (depending on how familiar you are with the basics).  I've found Diamant to be an excellent game to teach to new players, and can also be a great compliment to beer n' pretzels nights as there's really no serious thought required to play it.  Simple, pleasing to the eye, fast, and unique - and that's why I like it so much.

Update:  Get Diamant while you still can!!  Is it only available in German?  Who cares!?  Get it.  Incan Gold may be cheaper, but it's the remake.. the original is the best here, folks.

RATING: 8
Simple push-your-luck game for 3-8 players that plays very quickly. Rare to have a game this good that plays well with such a large range of player numbers.

OWN: the more-widely available "Incan Gold" (before game was re-re-released in 2017 as "Diamant" again!) which is a re-implementation of the original Diamant. Basically the components aren't quite as nice, but there is an extra gameplay element (artifacts).

The jewels in this game are great, and they really add something memorable about it as opposed to chips or something else.  The tents and what not also are very high quality.  I never seem to win this game as I'm just not good at knowing when to pull back, but I love trying.  A fast game that the whole fam can play and enjoy.

RATING: 7
A recent playing (with 4) has threatened its stay in my collection mainly due I think to the rule that explored cave cards (except the 2nd same disaster) are reshuffled before each round. As such this removes any speculative skill in deciding to progress or pull out and what I feel is the nagging conviction that luck undermines any deliberation. (This problem is highlighted when playing Zirkus Flocahti, a similar push your luck game whereby you go through the deck once, is more forgiving and which I'd much rather play with 4 than Diamant). 

The sitting out a la Cloud 9 bothers me alittle too as there is nothing active for the spectators to do except watch the sitcom. Diamant seems best with more than 4 as the divisions are smaller and there are richer pickings left behind. As with Hick Hack and Wyatt Earp there is that Jackpot payout which is wonderful drama. Yes I agree that the game is expensive for what it is, but I've yet to be convinced there is any better non-party filler for more than 5 players with little downtime.

This game is enjoyable for a few rounds but the 'Push Your Luck' element started to feel really repetitive rather than exciting to me. It's not an especially bad game and I wouldn't turn it down if it was a popular choice, but I certainly would never pick it.

A nice, quick playing push your luck game, where it's almost entirely player driven. Everyone secretly chooses to stay or go, then simultaneously reveal their cards. Players who leave the temple by themselves before the dangers kill everyone win big, players who leave a the same time win medium. Players eaten by disasters win nothing. Game is played over several rounds, so hopefully falling behind at the wrong time isn't devastating.

Super easy and great for large groups, especially with kids. I've used it at my kids birthday and class parties with great success. To really speed up the game, replace the in/out cards with a red and green plastic gem or button for each player. Then they just open their hand to reveal which one they choose and it's obvious at a glance. Lay them down on the table when you're out.

Good simple push-your-luck game. Do you go farther into the temple to try for more treasure, or leave with what you have? It also has a fun element of out-guessing the other players, since you get more benefits from running away when there are fewer people running away with you on the same turn. It's nice that it's played out over several rounds so even if you push too hard and lose everything on one round you can still do well in future rounds.

Incan Gold is a classic filler game based on the "push your luck" mechanism. About the same level of complexity as For Sale, Incan Gold can also be a good gateway game provided there are at least 4-6 players. The game plays upto 8, but I suspect it may be a bit chaotic with 8 players. The game lasts about 20-25 minutes (if all players know the rules) and there isn't much scope for AP as the decision on each turn is limited to 2 simple options - either continue exploring the ruins or get out with whatever treasure you've already collected.

Incan Gold is a card-driven press-your-luck from Faidutti and Moon. You are trying to push forward or turn back to acquire more jewels than your more risky/cautious coadventurers. 

This game is a real nice little press-your-luck game that doesn't use dice, and has a real sense of satisfaction when you pull out just in time to get some gold, or stick through to make it big. However it IS slightly strange that you are collecting gems in a game called Incan GOLD.

I own the Eagle/Gryphon Incan Gold edition. A very simple push your luck game that works pretty well with children and muggles both. It has the right amount of risk aversion and rooting for your opponents to fail. It's more or less a way to collect treasure, divided by the number of players left in the expedition. So you have an incentive to be the last one remaining, though if two threats are revealed that are the same, you go bust. So it's the same tension you'd get in many other PYL games, but that doesn't make it less fun.

Incan Gold version.  Those tents are a dumb idea, and I don't plan on buying another FRED game ever again.  I should have imported Diamant.  As for how the game plays, it's a fun idea, but it's kind of ruined by how similar the "stay" and "go" cards look.  Diamant would be 1, maybe 2 points higher.

I play on BSW and nearly always enjoy it. I also own Diamant and it gets played occasionally. 

I bumped it from 7.5 to 6. While it's a nice filler to play if you have lots of people I always wish, when that happens, that we were concentrating on breaking down into a couple smaller tables rather than playing every last game that plays 7 or 8.

Rating would likely go up if I played it more, with different numbers and types of groups, to assess its broad appeal and gameplay. Nice, easy-yet-strategic gameplay that is good for new and experienced gamers. Has psychology, luck, and probability.

I was patient and avoided picking up the overpriced FunAgain reprint - got a 2nd edition Diamant from TimeWellSpent for only $7 more 7/18/08

Since then I've played it with more variety of groups, and this game really does hit a nice niche - large groups, young-and-old groups, and fun filler. Increasing rating from 8 to 9.
Any game that my non-gamer mother-in-law says "that's a fun little game!" is a rare gem.

RATING: 4.5
A quick party game of trivial strategy -- but might be just as fun played solitaire. Too trivial for me to like. Update: played a second time as the Incan Gold version, which adds artifacts, making payoffs more uncertain and later expeditions more profitable, thus rewarding risk-taking more than ordinary Diamant. In consequence, I have reevaluated the game and raised my rating - from 4 to 4.5. I doubt there's anything they could do to the game to get my rating to go much higher.

great filler that plays quickly and generates a lot of laughs. non-gamers are impressed with the quality of the bits-the indiana jones meeples are pretty fun, not to mention the jewels and treasure crates. anyway, one problem  with the press your luck genre, at least for me, is that player interaction is usually pretty thin if not non-existent.  with diamant, the simultaneous action selection adds a nice element of bluffing and second guessing, which gets players to react to each other, which is all you need in a game this light. i also like how the odds change as the game progresses and how the game uses cards instead of dice. there's not much to this game, and even the new edition is still kind of pricey, but f' it: you're probably just going to spend the money you'd spend on this on something else just as frivolous, or temporal, so just pick it up if you want it.

How simple is this game!  
I first played it with a group of 5, one of which is slightly game-phobic.  However, when I explained that the only decision to be made on each turn is "stay" or "leave", the phobia fell away.  
Despite the simplicity of the decision to make, this is a really fun game of pushing your luck: the longer you stay in the mine, the more gems you could get, the bigger the risk of hazards & leaving with nothing.  
We ended up playing four complete games in a row because it's so quick yet compulsive.  On mines where everyone got out before falling to hazards, everyone wanted the cards to be continued just to see how far they could have gone!
An great game that is definitely suitable for even the most game-wary friends, and demands a replay.

This is like a game of chicken.  You don't want to be the first to flinch, but it's better than running away in terror and losing everything.  Five rounds didn't seem long enough to recover from a bad round or two.  Especially when a bad run of cards can end a round before it even begins.  I think I'd like this better if it had 8-10 rounds.

Incan gold is an inexpensive push your luck game.  I enjoy its quick play time and the fact it can support up to 8 players if needed.  The treasure pieces and "tents" are nicely produced and the cards feel sturdy.

This game was a big hit with my family - the theme went over well, it was fun seeing if someone lost all their take for the round due to some disaster, and it played fast so that the kids never lost interest.  In fact, after playing twice my youngest asked if we could play a third time!

The game is rather simplistic, but I think thats part of its appeal.  A lot of fun for not a lot of money - very glad I bought it.

Okay filler game.  Features elements of mind-reading and risk assessment, but really there is not enough texture here to make it more than chance.

It handles many players which is a good feature.

Our family loves this game.  However, we don't use the cards to indicate if we leave or go on.  We just count "one, two, three" and every one gives a hand signal.  Point to the dungeon to go on, a closed fist means your are going for the exit.  This simple "house mechanic" has made the game much less fiddly and more enjoyable for us.

A clever little game, essentially modelled around old fashioned gambling games. Players delve ever deeper into a mine sharing any gems found. If players fold they no longer claim a share, if they press on to long hazards close the mine and they lose everything. There is some nerve involved in holding as long as you should, a little psychology in picking the right moment to pull out, and a certain amount of counting in keeping track of the other players scores. Light fun that could easily pass an evening with the right group of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Incan Gold is  a simple push your luck game. Five times you and the other players enter a temple. One card at a time treasures (or disasters are revealed). Each time you take your share and choose to press on or run. If too many disasters strike the expedition is lost.
Its quite fun and easy to teach, I would consider it as a good gateway game to introduce those new to boardgames. It is less useful to fill a short time for gamers. It takes a little bit too long. And the dominant strategy is counting. Players treasure are hidden but you know all of the inputs and outputs so you ought to be able to calculate it. And in my experience want that from a light game.

A good filler for medium-to-large groups (and actually not at all bad with 3 or 4, as we usually play it these days). Basically it's push-your-luck - with an added twist that the fewer people who are left in, the better they will do if they survive - but also about trying to read what your opponents are doing. Not one I like to play all the time, but good fun on occasion.

You are also trying to outguess your rivals at the same time. Pretty good game that plays best with 5-8 number of players. I might prefer other fillers (For Sale, No thanks!, Liar's Dice) but this one certainly has it's place. My young daughters like it which is great.

I was really hopeful for this game. I normally love a good press your luck game. It might have just taken the first few games to get the hang out of a "normal" amount of time to stay in the cave to know how risky each extra card was. It ramped up much faster than I thought it would... or maybe just faster than I hoped it would.

RATING: 7
I cannot imagine a more elegant version of this game.  Every rule feels organic, as if the game grew naturally from good soil.  If, for the next 10 years, I never look at this game again, I will still be able to recite the rules from memory.  That's how natural and obvious the rules are.

Considering how superficially easy it is to teach, there is a surprising amount to it.  It fits a very specific but useful niche in my collection--something to pull out during parties, when 5-10 people (maybe even more, and certainly including children and non-gamers) are willing to devote as little as 15 minutes for a game (and that includes rules explanations).  

The fun is watching the band of explorers slowly chicken out.  The chickens hope the daredevils get their just desserts, and vice versa. The larger the group, the bigger the risk/reward payoff, and the more laughter/ooohs/aaaahs.  It's a thoughtful party game where no-one has to pantomime, show off their drawing skills, or do any other potentially embarrassing action.

Despite all that's good about it, Incan Gold/Diamant is still a one-note filler game.  There is only one decision to be made over and over again--given the probability of death in the next room (a value which can be easily calculated), should I continue or retreat safely with my treasure?  Each decision is basically  identical to the next.  Each game is basically identical to the next.  But the game serves its purpose well, which is to generate laughter/ooohs/aaahs from your friends and family.

PS.  I own Incan Gold.  Diamant looks better, but is considerably more expensive.  Incan Gold art is too dark.  Creepy child zombie art feels out of place for this kind of light game.  Almost all components have been made from playing cards, even the components that would be better made out of things other than playing cards (specifically, the "go/no go" cards and the money tents).  But oh well, for the price, it's still a good deal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solid filler game with a great press-your-luck mechanic that almost always ends in heartbreak, at least for me. Cool components (love the gems and tents) and simple gameplay make this a win.

Theme is also pretty cool - kind of lightly indiana jonesish.

RATING: 5
Diamant somewhat lost its luster over time. I still enjoy it, but the fun-factor is not nearly as high as, say, Liar's dice, another entry in the accessible, high-player-count, party-game department. An absurdly early cave-in can happen from time to time, which feels somewhat dissatisfying. 

It certainly plays better at high player counts, because players are incentivized to delve deeper to avoid sharing the riches. Higher player counts also make the decision to take or ignore relics feel much more impactful. However, the pure push-your-luck nature lacks the competitive punch I seek in most games. It does not betray its purpose in that regard, and remains a commendable filler.

(+) Light rules overhead and quick to teach and play.
(+) IELLO version in particular as high production quality. The components are vibrant, the boxes are sturdy, and overall the game is visually appealing.
(+) Works even better at higher player counts.

(-) Almost -too- simple. Push-your-luck is all that it offers.
(-) It is a bit too random at times. Bad luck can be jarring when it ends the fun spelunking phase too early.
(-) Shallow gameplay already made me feel like it lacks longevity, though I can see it retaining novelty if left unplayed for a while.

This is a classic "push your luck" boardgame. Also known as "Incan Gold". This edition of Devir from 2017 has a good quality and it´s beautiful. I recommend to be patience when assembling the holdings: you´ve to assemble them with care, trying not to bend the pins of cardboard, which are very thick, by the way. Cards are a bit thin; I mean, I expected them thicker, but they're fine. Without a doubt, this is a great "filler" for all the family: it´s a game where LUCK prevails, it´s very easy to learn, it´s fun, fast, and very exciting. My family and friends love this game, and this last Summer we were playing it a lot! Maybe too much for my taste...  :-/

A fun little game of bluff and chance to end off an evening. When is discretion the better part of valour? If I go now, will I get the bonus treasure? Can I beat the odds by holding on for one more card? This is the antithesis of most of the deep-thinking, strategic games we play (although a grasp of basic probability does help), but I like it because I never feel cheated if I lose - it's just too random.

Pressure is building up with each new card, more dangers aproach, are you willing to go in and risk your skin for more treasure or will your grab what you can and get out of that temple.

09-09-2014. Reratings after 7 plays. I still rate the game highly (8). My go to filler.

29-05-2014. Rated after 1 play with 4. I recently acquired a second-hand -but as new- copy of Diamant. 

In Diamant you play adventurers aiming to get most loot/treasure/jewels from a dangerous cave with a host of dangers as possible. You do this by flipping cards from a deck of 30 cards to symbolize exploring the cave. This temple deck consists out of 5 sets of 3 danger cards and 15 jewel cards of various denominations. 

For each treasure card flipped, you equally divide the number of jewels across the adventurers. If a few jewels cannot be divided, they are put on the card to be picked up later. Before the next card is flipped, each player chooses secretly to continue or leave the cave. If the player chooses to leave, he picks up all remaining treasures. If several choose to leave at the same time, they divide remaining treasures equally and safely store their loot outside of the cave.

If the players push on, the next card if flipped. If the flipped card is a danger card, and an identical danger card was already revealed everyone still inside dies and gets no treasure.

After 5 rounds, the one with most safely stored jewels is the winner.

I really like this game. It's a simple push your luck-type filler that plays up to 8, in about 20 minutes. Regardless, the game offers some challenge and you have to predict what other people are going to do (flee or push) and if you still dare to continue given the amount of danger / amount of jewels you already have. In short, yes, it's a simple game, but it's incredibly fun, elicits laughter and just makes for an excellent time..

I would say this is  more of a family style game that is just simply a press your luck game.Will I risk going deeper into the temple and collect more jewels or will I get chased out and gain nothing?that sums up the whole game.

The bits that are provided with the game come in eye-catching colors (gold, onyx, and a beautiful turquoise) and the artwork is nice.

Cons: The system to hide your "banked" points is flimsy and not protective enough.  After a while, the system to decide whether you will press your luck or not gets repetitive and annoying.

Like Lost Cities, I spent a long time deriding Incan Gold, but I eventually came around on it. Part of that is a relaxed attitude toward luck, a better understanding of what the game is trying to accomplish, and the realization that it is the rare game that works well with a wide variety of age groups at one table. The FRED edition is probably definitive as well, making this one of the best light games out there.

Half the reason I like this game is the presentation. I'm known to salvage coloured gems from other games just to add to the bling factor.

Underneath is a pretty good push-your-luck game. Dropping/not dropping your adventurer kinda slows the game down, but I do it to enhance the drama. Leaving a trail of the indivisible gems is great because it gives people incentive to leave early due to gain, in addition to the fear of loss from the traps.

I actually had a disappointing first play of the game and spent some time crunching the statistics. Now I strongly recommend that people play with only 2 of each trap card (or require that all 3 need to be revealed). The deck is surprisingly trap-heavy, so this helps to prevent anti-climaxes. It also makes each successive cave more lucrative (and therefore fun!), since you're removing an entire trap each time you die.

A favorite for over a decade. Push you luck doesn't get any better than this, IMO. Sure, Can't Stop exists, but this has that little dross of theme which kicks it up a level. I've never had this one fail, and I think I need both hands to count how many non-gamers I've made REALLY excited about boardgaming with this one.

I like to play up the tension, draw out the choices. he miners don't die, they run screaming from the mine dropping all of their jewels, if I play with my kids.

It's too terrible to contemplate playing with the crappy-componented American version. inca gold or something? I shudder at how much worse it feels than this one. Played once, never again. Spend the money on an Amazon.de order. It's worth it!

A push-your-luck game that suffers the usual problem, you might as well stay in the temple until everyone else leaves and take all the remaining rewards for yourself... or die.  In the end it comes down to the turn of one card each round.  Ho-hum.

Fun push-your-luck game that can be played with up to 8 people. A fixed part of my 'party game collection' from now on! The mechanics are really easy: "will you venture deeper into the cave: Y/N?" That's all there is to it, and therefore the game is easy to explain, quick to learn and the luck-based system actually gives every player at the table a chance to come out on top.

Iello's edition gives it beautiful artwork and shiny components, making this already quick-to-grasp game all the more easy to get through to people and onto the table.

A real good push your luck game with a bit of group think. Plays fast even with the full 7 or 8. I revised this game uo to an 8 because it seems to be played most game sessions. The fact that it scales up to 6, 7 & 8 so well makes it a great filler game for a large group.

A nice quick and fun push your luck game.
Fun theme being in a band of Indiana Jones style treasure hunters seeing who will stay in the longest to get more treasure or who will flee.
Can play up to a large number of players as well, so a good game to fill in quickly and get a few people involved. Another good game to play with a wide mix of people.
I think its more fun trying to stay in as long as you can and i don't worry too much about winning overall. 
Will definitely play again and good one to get in the collection to pull out.

The popularity of this game around my house has been a very pleasant surprise.  The idea behind the game is really quite simple -- how far are you willing to push your luck?  But there is analysis that can be put into that.  What are the rewards for leaving against possible penalties for staying?  Do you need to make up ground?  What is the likelihood of a detrimental draw?  Against that, you can do well playing solely from your gut -- something my daughters do quite well.  That levels the playing field in a manner that allows them to beat daddy, which is something they find endless enjoyment in.  Perhaps its popularity here should not be so surprising after all :)  [02/02/2008]

Another one of those simple designs that works so well you cannot understand why you haven't seen it before. It's a push your luck game with an added incentive of remainder gems for the people leaving(no longer pushing their luck). So, it is hugely luck dependent (well I would say that as lost hideously), but it captures the imagination and is just so much fun I reckon multiple games are required every session.

Another great large party filler game. We introduce many non gamer friends to our game collection by starting with the simple to teach and fun to play Incan Gold. We bought this because we needed a game that could play more than 5 and we needed a quick game to begin a game night. This met both those criteria, as a bonus our daughter loves it and can teach it to others and run the levels now by herself. There is just enough press your luck and strategy to keep us entertained. New people always want to play it a few times.

Own both Diamant and Incan Gold --

Diamant -- Played 3 through 8 players.  Enjoyed every time.  Treasure chests and Indiana Jones-shaped meeples!  Fun in a party atmosphere or as a filler.  The "Diamant Jones and the Forbidden Idol" variant brings some nail-biting tension to the game -- When a player gets the idol, it makes for a lot of noise, and when players try but fail, the frustrated hopes are palpable.

Incan Gold -- Artifacts and three denominations of gems made this worth checking out.

Incan Diamant -- The best components and elements of both games!

It's an immensely simple game with great theme, good looking art and proper suspense in a shape of risk taking - it's got everything that's needed in order to play this with nearly anyone and plays 3-8 people.

Played 1 3P game of this. A very simple, quick yet engaging game where players are exploring an ancient temple and encountering treasures and hazards along the way. The only decision you are going to make throughout the game is to press on or stop. If players recklessly plunge headlong, they can be either rewarded with plenty of gold, or lose everything they have gathered so far. At the same time, deciding to go back is not so easy, as the number of players who turn back at the same time can influence the amount of treasure picked up. A fantastic filler!

2016: 7. A fun light push-your-luck filler game that plays well regardless of the number of players.  Wins can be swingy 'cuz the game involves so much luck, but I don't mind it at all.  For me it's all about the laughs and second guessing and "rolling of the dice" to see if you can get just that little bit more out of the cave than anyone else!

Played this game with my nieces and nephew (7, 5 and 3) and they totally got what was going on. (Pro tip: get little bowls for the kiddies instead of the tents, your jewels won't go flying all over the place) And I think that's where the game shines: a light, fun family game that plays a lot of people and you can have a great time regardless of your age or gaming experience.  Gamer-gamers should probably look for other options.

2017: 8. I think this is my go to party/kids/everybody filler game.  Plays a lot, plays quick, people don't have to think, and it plays all ages.  It's perfect.

Fun push your luck game. Players explore a mine and try to get gems for staying and leaving. Some good tense moments and all round good fun.

Only negatives: Not enough gems when playing with 7 or 8 players. The game is WAY overpriced for a bag of gems, some cards, wooden bits. Plus the second edition lost the atmospheric camp board. It's no surprise that this wasn't picked up by an english publisher!

Excellent party/light game for a huge number of players. Pay the extra money for Diamant because Incan Gold is pretty ugly - dark, odd artwork, no "Indy" meeples, no carts (instead, you bend cards to make tents), and unattractive gems. They may have found a way to lower the price of the game but they sure sacrificed a lot.

Diamant is a very simple game of "push your luck". There are five turns in the game, each one consisting of a few to several rounds. In each round, each player decides before time whether s/he wishes to be "in" or "out". Then a card is revealed. If the card is a treasure card, all "in" players get an equal share of the booty. There are (I think) 15 treasure cards. Leftover treasure sits on the card. If it is an artifact card, nothing happens. If it is a hazard card, and the first of its type, nothing happens. (There are 3 each of 5 different hazard cards, if I recall.) If the revealed card is the *second* hazard of a given type - that is, one has already been revealed this round - then all players who are "in" LOSE all the treasure they have accumulated in the round so far. So as you play deeper into a round, and more hazards appear, you must decide whether staying "in" (and the chance of getting even more treasure) justifies the possibility of losing everything. As soon as you decide to go "out" (return to camp), then you and any other departures travel back along the cards already revealed, splitting any leftover treasure sitting there. Also, if ONLY on person leaves, and an artifact has been revealed, that player gets to claim the artifact as his own. When you go "out" you place your treasure (in the Incan Gold version) under you card tent, and you cannot lose it. It's yours until the end of the game.

Diamant/Incan Gold is a very simple game with two prominent elements: 1) figuring your odds based upon deck composition and what has already been revealed, and 2) bluffing your opponents/doing the unexpected. You must balance (1) with (2) to win. You have to make prudent decisions, but you also (ideally) would like to see the other players chickening out and leaving you to get all the treasure, or conversely: you bail out when the time is right, and they lose everything.

This game gets much better with more players, which makes it a nice party game. It also seems great for kids, as the mechanics are simple, there is basic math (learning is fun!), there is good tension, and it's fun! But it isn't a very satisfying game for me. That is to say, it's a filler. It's a *good* filler, but I don't generally think filler games are the bees' knees. Even so, I would recommend this game to pretty much anybody, simply because it is so good as a filler and because anyone can play.

I'm rating this as a game for 5 year olds! 

And up of course, but really, my rating is for this being a game that an adult can really play with a 5yo and both enjoy themselves. How rare is that?! So yes, I'm rating it as a family game, but specifically as a game for 5yos, because there are too few good games for the 3-5yo set.

My 5yo absolutely loves Incan Gold, and the 6yo neighbor girl visits us specifically requesting Incan Gold. To top it all off, Incan Gold teaches them adding, and introduces adding 5's and 10's. And that just sneaks up on them without them really noticing it. The first maybe 10 plays we counted out the gold & jewels to go on the cards, but after a while they took over, asking if they did it correctly. They WANTED to learn it - how great is that?! My kid is now soon 6 and the girl soon 7, but we still have to count who won. But if you want kids to do it on their own, you just use the 1-point jewels, that way they can count them easier, or just measure stacks.

The art may be too scary for some 5yos. If your kid is prone to nightmares, I'd wait a while with Ican Gold. We had to un-scarify the zombie by just referring her as "oh no, it's that scary old lady". ("Undead" would definitely be too much ... :-D) But then the rest was ok. 

I will be gifting Incan Gold to well-balanced non-traumatized secure-in-themselves 5yos in the future.

My only gripe would be that I wish the gold & jewels were as pretty as the ones in Diamant.

Nonetheless, it plays with more players than Cloud 9 and is quick and simple to explain to large groups.

There is certainly something to the game, luck is prevelant but there are some decisions to it that have their own repercussions.   The thing that makes this game unique is the decision of when to bail.  Timing is essential on when to pick up the jewels on your way out of the cave.  It is good fun, when you want a lucky filler.  

Update:  The new version doesn't have the original board, so now it's affordable.  Well worth the price, a great game, and a great buy.

Wow, this was really good.  Were this domestically available at a reasonable price point, I would snap this one up.  Quite a good game of 'Press Your Luck', but since all players are in it simultaneously, there is no player downtime other than when someone ducks out, and it also scales up to eight!  The components for the Schmidt Spiele version are quite nice with the plastic gemstones and the "boxes" for the individual players.

Despite what I say about this being domestically available, I am still grateful that I have Diamant instead of Incan Gold.  Bits do count for something.

Initial BSW rating. It's as high as it is because of an intangible sense of fun that accompanies game play. I must have played about 15 games in a row the first time I tried it, which is unheard of for me. I just kept re-joining and having at it over and over again. Scales well through 8 players. Graphics and sound on BSW are terrific. Comparisons to "Can't Stop" are appropriate, but for some strange (intangible) reason, falling off the "Can't Stop" mountain is more frustrating and annoying than losing your diamonds in this game. It stays fun and encourages repeat play in a way that "Can't Stop" doesn't.

Still like this game, but the components of Incan Gold are not as good as Diamant's.  The game loses some of it's character because of this.  I play with little meeples instead of the in/out cards that come with the game.

Great game for kindergartners (and I mean that in the nicest possible way -- gets them engaged, thinking, trying to guess what everyone else is going to do); fell flat after a few plays with the adults (gamer and non-gamer) and gamer kids in my life.  So the 6 is kind of an average -- it's a 7 when I'm choosing what to play with little kids and a 5 when I'm choosing what I want to play.

A pretty good push-your-luck game.

The original version is MUCh nicer than Incan Gold -- the cards are hard to tell apart quickly and the folded tents aren't as nice as the little crate.

Gryphon games edition: 
- love the tents!
- I'd prefer the meeples over the 2 decision cards
- like the other Gryphon games, the cards are a bit too flimsy and seem to be cut with the edges curving inward just enough to be annoying: a bit difficult to shuffle, and to separate cards from one another when fanning them.

This game is quickly becoming a favorite to pull out for family game nights. There aren't a whole lot of games that are as appealing to both the kids and parents as this one, which my 4yo refers to as "the game where everybody runs out of the temple screaming like little girls!" He's even picking up on the division concepts while we play, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This seems to be a good little game for kids or non-gamers, as well as a simple little filler for a larger group.  Although I find it becomes stale pretty quickly, it has been very well received by most people I have introduced it to, largely, I think, due to its simplicity and to the tension built into the "push your luck" mechanic (which is all this game really is).  For myself, there is just too little to the game to keep me interested.  But having said that, for what it is, it is very well produced.  Although my edition didn't come with the game board (which is not at all necessary), it does have a lot of neat bits what with all the gems, the treasure boxes, and the little wooden explorers.  One advantage of this game is that it can be played with up to 8 people, although if I were looking for a simple game to play with a larger group I'd be more inclined to pull out a party game.  And I wouldn't really recommend playing with less than four due to the decreased amount of competition in an already fairly dry game.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 6/10

Good push-your-luck filler. Turn over a card, either treasure or a hazard. Players simultaneously choose whether to leave the temple (splitting treasure found so far) or stay. A second hazard of the same type means those remaining get nothing.

An excellent example of the genre, perhaps the very best because it plays briskly even with more players, but not one I have any interest in. If Ra involves too much luck for my taste, you can guess what I think about Incan Gold. I'd rather play the "have a conversation" filler.

A filler game that I like, although I can see how some people may say there is too much luck.  The luck factor should be balanced out over the multiple mines you enter throughout the game, so I don't think it's a big deal.  This game really needs to be played with a larger group of people (i.e. at LEAST 4).  The neat part is the game really comes down to the last mine and how long someone is willing to stay in.  Makes for some surprise endings.

Greed is good, so good that this game will bury you in it. Good judgment and timing can pay off, but the prudent path isn't always the most profitable.

RATING: 6.5
Based on a number of plays. I have mostly played with kids but sometimes with adults or a mixture.  The kids (ages 4 - 7) liked the game.  The 4 year olds understand the rules and the game's pace is fast enough to keep their attention.  However, they do not quite have a competitive level of strategy and are not able make good choices.  The 7 year old caught on pretty fast and can play it well.  The adults in general have not overly excited about the game, and impression I got was "hmm... decent kids game".  None of the adults were eager to replay it right away.  I would probably give it about a 5 or 6 myself,  my kids would probably give it a 8 or so, so I blend the rating to be 7 for my family.  Dropped it to a 6.5 because the replay value is less than I initially thought for both kids and adults.  Still an okay game, but can be repetitive if played enough times.

RATING: 6.5
[Schmidt Spiele 'Diamant' first edition with the board] {Treasure hunt, beers&pretzels, gateway; luck-pressing, simultaneous-action; optimal 6-8p} Diamant is a pleasant party game with nice player interaction. It is suitable for all kinds of players. It's funny to see that everyone retreats while you are the only one choose to stay :laugh: and everyone yelling disaster / gem.

The pawns, treasure create and diamonds are very beautiful and attractive. Maybe, these excellent bits make the game unfairly expensive. USD39.95 is really too much for this simple party game. I am lucky to have a copy of the first edition. Although the board, pawns and crates are not necessary to play the game, Diamant is more enjoyable with it.

[Update] I am not convinced by the Incan Gold edition. The original bits are cool. Even though there are new rules, I stick to Diamant.

Marvelous little family game. Elegant and restrained. The exploration theme works well too. Push your fellow explorers to move further into the cave while you sneak off and scoop up the leftovers. Someone else mentioned that this was Can't Stop + Adel. Couldn't have said it better myself. Bravo!

Rating moved from an 8 to a 9 after playing it in person. We played three times in a row and laughed uproariously each time. My favorite so far for 2005!

Update: Finally played the "Incan Gold" version. Not bad at all and a nice new scoring variation that's not possible to play with the original. Still, I'm fine with the original and feel no real need to upgrade. However, If you don't have the original, INCAN GOLD is a MUST PURCHASE.

The more I play this one the duller it gets. There is some tension, but the game just comes down to getting out when the gettin's good, and everyone can figure out when that is after a game or 2. When played with people that have played the game a few times it becomes very scripted. Still a fun filler for nongamers.

Very nice push-your-luck game.  Like all PYLGs it's very luck heavy but that's expected and the game is short which is always a plus with this type of game because it means it can be played again and again.  Good game for kids since they have as much of a chance to win as anyone (if not better - I find adults tend to overanalyze the game).

Push your luck.  Light, fast, and plays up to 8.  The 2-player variant is OK but not really worth the time given all of the other 2 players to choose from.  We always use the Diamant Jones variant.  Plays nice & quick and is a lot of fun.  Great with a large group.  We added 15 green emeralds which are worth 10 rubies to solve the problem of running out of jewels, and we use the emerald in the Diamant Jones variant.  A favorite with kids, too.

I like the idea of the challenge and I have played a lot of my favorite games more often (Robinson Crusoe, Claustrophobia, Warfighter) but taking part in the challenge also burned us out on a few games.  Incan Gold is one of them.  I think this game will be on the shelf for awhile.  It is a good game though so it will be sticking around.

The game that I searched high and low to finally buy came missing with the game-board, arghh! Fortunately it didn't detract play too much...The simple game mechanic of pushing your luck somehow has a great appeal in the game scenario of adventuring through the tunnels. But simplicity is a two-edged sword and the greatness of the game is also limited by the simple mechanic. The precious stones and wooden carts are very attractive game bits though!

RATING: 7
A recent, but solid addition to my collection. Incan Gold is a very easy game to teach and plays very quickly. It is essentially a “press-your luck” game where you may guarantee your winnings, but those who dare to go farther may get more riches or lose them all. You play five rounds so you might get nothing in one round, but manage to win it all by doing well on the others. Before each turn you flip either a camp (leave the temple, but keep what you have found) or torch (can get more riches, but risk losing everything from that round).  The cards and gems are very nice quality and come in a small box which is easy to store. The tents where you place your winnings inside, to hide the total from everyone else are also pretty cool!

My only complaint is that the torch and camp cards are a little too similar…

RATING: 8
Incan Gold (US variant): Plus: artifact cards (artifacts come out and the game gets very strange). Minuses: cards are standard-size and don't form a maze, so a Diamant-style layout can get too big for a small table. Mixed: Tents aren't as nice as treasure chests, but are more secretive; the continue/run-away cards aren't as nice as the meeples and the run-away card can get misplaced, but some players like the idea that they can randomized the cards and their choice; the lumps of faux touquise, obsidian, and gold aren't as nice as the rubies and diamonds, but more--enough--are in the game.

About the only good thing to say about Incan Gold is it's so simple, children can play it and everyone will still have a good time.

Here's my problem with the game. Because your personal "guaranteed money" stack is small compared to the money on the track, you have no good choices. If you leave, someone else will leave with you, so you won't get the artifacts and you'll have to split what's on the track. If you stay, the people who left will clear the track, which means for the next few rounds you'll have nothing to gain by leaving yourself. By the time it's worth leaving again, either you'll have hit two matching disasters and get nothing, or leaving will still be a bad choice.

Games like Can't Stop, or even "Deal or No Deal," are more interesting because it's quite easy to build up your earnings to the point where you have something significant to gain by stopping, which means you have something to gain by going on as well. So there are two good choices, which is a much funner position to be in than Incan Gold's two bad choices, which are just not fun at all.

Hard rating.  I don't see myself turning down a game most of the time (putting it at the 8 level) but then the strategic options are fairly limited, and if there's a moment when I feel like playing something with more meat, Diamant simply couldn't fit the bill.  But the "Big money, big money, no whammies!" experience Diamant provides is almost unmatched.

Not quite as exciting as I was hoping it would be. The push-your-luck mechanic needs more tension. Plus, in the first few rounds of every turn, everyone does the same thing over and over. I'll try it again when I'm in the mood for something light with a larger group.

Almost entirely random game, which basically comes down to how far you want to push your luck. For all that, it's still a good laugh with the right group of players, especially if there's plenty of you playing.

Edit: Although the above still stands, I'm rather tired of it now. the sheer randomness just means I'd never select it above a game which has at least some level of skill involved.

Fun lightweight game. Often compared with Can't Stop because of the "push your luck" element, but to me it feels more like the end of an epoch in Ra - get out with something safely or get greedy and perhaps helplessly watch the Ra track fill up (or, in the cae of Diamant, be killed in a variety of creative mining accidents involving snakes, gas, cave-ins, explosions and scorpions)? Quick, simple and tense.

One of the best press-your-luck games, Incan Gold is simple, thematic, and downright stressful as you push your adventurer deeper into the caves, hoping you won't be crushed, burned, eaten alive, or murdered by cannibal pygmies before escaping with a fistful of gems. The components here are a bit flimsy (especially compared to the pricier Diamant), but definitely worth a spot in every collection due to its easy rules, ability to work with a large number of players, and fast and fun gameplay.

Not a bad push-your-luck filler. Seems best with about 4-6 players. Even though it's push-your-luck, sometimes the rounds can end too quickly and nobody gets to collect much treasure through the whole game. There are still some fun elements of trying to guess when your opponents will leave so that you can get the most treasure for yourself.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 5+[/b]
The game needs more players to be interesting. That way you never know who is going to run out early and grab an artifact, and who is going to stay in until the end.

Fast and fun, although half the time I don't get any gems at all; the hazards are very numerous and running early with an average haul often seems to work better than risking it for a couple more tiles, but I can't resist pushing on to try for a ridiculous fluke victory. It's getting tedious with more plays but definitely fills a niche for something quick for a large number of players.

This is my second-favorite filler at the time (For Sale is on top). It's tense and presents a nice little press-your-luck game for up to 8 players. Very few short fillers scale so high and so well. I was in the need of a filler-style game that played a high number of players, this was perfect.

RATING: 6.5
Definitely plays better as you increase players. In fact my rating would go up .5 or one point if I only played with 6-8 players.

Why are the "Stay" and "Leave" cards so similar. Every game it seems as though someone picks the wrong card accidentally. Why can't one be all dark and tomb-y and the other be bright and outside-y?

Plays up to eight people over a wide age range in less than 30 minutes and takes up very little space (packed up or on the table).  For a gamer who travels this is pretty special.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 5

RATING: 6.5
Of course it's random! That's the fun!

The only demonstrable skill you might learn from Incan Gold is learning when discretion is absolutely the better part of valour - and legging it, collecting any gold strewn about.

I suppose you can just about the stretch the point to say that IG encourages planning, but that's questionable. But it is fun, and it's a great game for newbies to cut their teeth on, and for that reason, it gets a solid 6.5 from me.

RATING: 5
A fun push-your-luck diversion.  Great with a group of kids or non-gamers, but certainly not a gamer's game.  It still can be great fun as a filler, though.  The 'tents' (cards folded in half) are a far cry from Diamant's treasure chests, and you'll miss the sparkly gems of the original as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Most of my plays of this have been with Incan Gold, but now that I own Diamant, I can't imagine going back.  Diamant's components are better on all fronts - from the treasure carts to the Indiana Jones meeple to the sparkly gems.  I suppose the artwork on the cards is a matter of taste, some may prefer the art from Incan Gold.

Both games are fun push-your-luck diversions - great with a group of kids or non-gamers, but certainly not a gamer's game (though they still can be great fun as fillers).

A quintessential push-your-luck game as player decide whether to push deeper into the mine and risk everything, or run away. Also some interesting decisions about when to run away to get the most benefit. 

Not especially deep, but it's actually playable with 5 or 6 casual players and manages to entertain them at the same time. Happiy owned for this niche.

I have had great success introducing this to new gamers, so much so I'm a little tired of playing it.  That aside I think its a neat push your luck game.  The components seem a little overdone and I wish there was a better way to pick if your staying or leaving, the cards for this seem fiddly.

See comments for Diamant.  Other than the relics (which are neither here nor there for me) the differences come down to components.  I like the treasure chests and gems of Diamant, but like Incan Gold's cards for selecting whether to stay in/run out.

A filler hit! Fun, fast push-your-luck kind of game. Easy to teach and, even with 6 (the most I have played) all is said and done in about 20 minutes.

There is only two things to do:
1 - Decide if you want to stay in the search for treasures or return to camp;
2 - Turn over the next search card.

Sure, there is reasons to return (take what was left in the cards passed and the artifacts) and to continue (gain more treasure), but if the second hazard of the same type appear, bad luck! Everyone still in the search lose everything.

Really good game!

bought this as a kid game as reports have placed it as an excellent kindergarten game. Early gaming sessions with the kids bring positive results: they love the theme, love the mechanic. what I don't love is the "incan gold" edition that I got...this game could be done so much better with different bits. manipulating all the cards is too clumsy for a game that should be fairly quick moving. feel like I should build my own version.

interested in the gryphon games edition, but still wish there were meeples instead of cards for choosing player action. (easy enough to substitute.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Oddly more fun in the actual playing than in the anticipation, which for me can keep it off the table. But a nice little push-your-luck game if you just take it on its own terms.

My group really gets a kick out of Incan Gold. It gives you the gambling thrill of Zombie Dice with a lot more player interaction. My wife loves it, and that's a huge bonus. I feel it's a wasted opportunity that the artifact cards have different pictures but are functionally equivalent. Mostly it's a game to howl at your own misfortune and rejoice at the misfortune of others. That's always a good time. I'd give it a higher rating, but it frustrates me that, once I bring it out, we likely won't be playing anything  more complex later on. For that, I resent Incan Gold just a little bit.

Incan Gold Edition - relatively simple card game for up to 8 players (explorers) venturing into an Incan Temple all trying to amass the biggest cache of gems & artifacts and return them to the safety of their camps. There are 5 Quests (rounds) per game each of which has 15 'Quest' (Good)cards and 15 'Hazard' (Bad) cards, with anything from 1 to 5 artifacts also thrown in for good measure. These all form the 'Quest' draw pile that is used each round to determine what the explorers find as they venture into the Temple. Plays very quickly with each explorer deciding whether they should stay in the temple (and suffer or benefit from another draw card), or, return to their camp with the 'goodies' already amassed. Stay too long and you could lose everything, run too soon and you could miss further treasures. Game of fun, of nerve, bluff and double bluff with lots of cat-calling as those less fearless (some would argue - wise) souls run from the Temple's darkest depths... run-rabbit-run!!

Simple but good press-your-luck game with a good theme. Fast-paced. Always loved by casual gamers. I love adventure themes, very particularly Indiana Jones style. It makes me love this game, and also because the simultaneous action selection mechanic.
But after multiple plays, players will eventually realize that values are faked. The game may suffer where most players would simply perform luck chasing til the end of game. Fun factor diminishes this way. I believe IMHO a meta-game penalty for the losers, or the relation with real life values (say... a cent) would remedy the situation and boost the fun factor to climax.

Rating after several plays with mainly nongamers. Best with many players: There should be at least four. Easy to explain and quick to play (about 20 minutes) with above average components. The game has a serious addictive quality, and I indeed recommend to play at least twice in a row (especially if people are new to the game). Fun to play when the mood is right and there are enough players. Personally, I like it better than Piranha Pedro (which has a similar feel to it).
UPDATE: After all these years, it's still the best press your luck filler game I own. The turns and game have just the right length. I'm happy to suggest this game in any family setting.

Own Incan Gold, but Diamant is really a much better version of the game. The components in Diamant are just downright superior. Having played Diamant, I like using a hidden Indy-Jones meeple in the palm to indicate your hidden choice instead of playing a card. Faster and cleaner. The crates are an upgrade from the tent cards which are just ugly in Incan Gold

The only quibble I have is the artifact cards in Incan Gold. I actually like having the artifact cards since they allow people from the backend to catch up. After someone flees, it is usually a suicide mission to stay on for the remainder of the folks. With artifacts, it makes for a more interesting game.

Basically playing chicken....who gets to pull out first and who tries to maintain the lead. The idea comes from risk-taking and the optimum time to call for a strategic pull out before things get too tough or dangerous.

Not a bad game, plays well with 7-8 since it is simultaneous action. Not many other games can fulfill that criteria

RATING: 7
This is yet another push your luck game.  The theme and the nice gems are really the only thing that sets this appart from the rest.  The probability manipulation is probably less interesting than in Cloud Nine and certainly less than Pickomino, but it fits the theme very well.  It makes a very nice filler and I have no problem when people suggest the game.

Had high hopes for this - another game that is, IME, over rated.  It's push your luck which I like playing, but that itch is scratched better with other games.  

Comparisons to other such games like Can't Stop are not accurate.  In that game your odds are always visible.  Incan Gold is close to a total crap shoot.  The only basis for knowing if the odds are in your favor are by seeing how far you are into the deck and how many bad cards have popped up so far.  Simply do not understand the love for this game.

I love the risk taking mechanism this game presents. Do I press forward and hope my competitors bow out leaving me a larger cut? Or do I take the safe route and pick up those leftover gems, hoping no one else chickens out so I don't have to split those loose rubies. Its a fairly simple game but has a lot of tense moments.

My highest rated light game.  I love heavy games but I have to give this one a 9.  I've played it in the hundreds of times.  It works well with any group.  Family, casuals, non-gamers, kids, gamers, etc...

I've never played just one game of this in a sitting.  We always play a second.  I still request to bring this out to the group.  The fact that I haven't grown bored with it yet shows that it is a truly excellent game.  Perhaps my best value per dollar expenditure in terms of pure play time.

RATING: 6
Explore in a perilous mine shaft to find treasure. A very light push-your-luck game that can handle large numbers (max 8, wouldn't play with less than 6). Good for when a no-brain game is called for - closing out a game night, party gaming, playing with non-gamers. Plays extremely fast. Components in the Schmidt Spiel Diamant edition are really nice and add to game play but box is too large for what it needs to hold, unnecessarily increasing its real estate footprint in the game bag, and price may be somewhat steep for what you get. Ok game but traded for Taluva at Montreal Mathtrade February 2009.

Very fun push-your-luck game, my second-favorite of this kind, next only to Can't Stop. You collect jewels in mines but try to leave before you get too greedy or you lose them all. This game is out of print, and I have the re-released version, called "Incan Gold" which is the same game but doesn't have the wonderful wooden pieces that the original has. Get this out of print version if you can find it.

Only played once, but really this game is simple enough to get everything in one play.  

I liked it a decent amount, it's a fun, communal push your luck game.  Plays very quick.  For what it is I think it's great if you want a very straight-forward push your luck game.  These days I just think there are better choices available with some more control over your fate, and possibly with a better chance of coming up from behind.

Incan gold is a lot of fun, but the fun is user driven. I did a lot of narrating our exploration to liven the game up, and it made for some really interesting adventures. However it's a lot of effort to keep it exciting since the gameplay doesn't change that much and eventually the tension of whether or not someone is going to leave or stay fades. I want to find other games like it: easy to teach, quick to play, and immediate payoff in entertainment.

Simple enought that it would be easy to play with a deck of cards, and a bunch of pennies and nickels.

Yet, the game accomplishes what it was designed to do.  It's short, easy to understand, feels very original, and is always a blast to play.  It's a great warm-up game to use before getting into something heavier.

After many plays now, I find it's one of the best short games that plays more than 6 players.  We end up playing it a lot.

Really fast, and that's the saving grace.  I don't care much for the artwork, and the color scheme of the gems reminds me why we've left behind Zubaz in the early 90s, but the gameplay is satisfying, especially for a fast filler.  Great to play while you're waiting to see who's going to show up.  I'm guessing (and I've been told) that it scales well.  Tense enough to be interesting, and pushing your luck appeals to the primal instinct in almost everybody.

Первые впечатления негативные. Ужасно написан rulebook. Что удивительно. Игра фактически переиздание другой с добавлением артефактов. 
Пробовали играть вшестером. Не тот фан, что ожидалось. Достает fiddling. С этими мелкими камушками. Проще было бы с казиношными фишками, но все равно. Сама идея так себе. Push your luck с некоторым пробалансным изощрением и маркетинговым отемачиванием.
Думаю, что делать с коробкой дальше. Если бы не прикольные палаточки, то возмущался бы, что розн. цена в $25 за полколоды карт и пригорошню цветных пипирок уж слишком. Работают имена Faidutti и Moon  .

I was able to pick up Diamant from Canada. Most of my plays are from BSW but my gaming group and nieces still request it.
I finally got to play Incan Gold and I actually enjoyed it better than Diamant. The tents hide the gold better and the artifacts are cool as well. The cards are easier to shuffle too. *8/21/08 I see that an Incan Gold entry has been created. I'll log my IG plays over there now and my Diamant plays here*

I prefer this one slightly more than my Diamant copy. The bits aren't nearly as nice but the tent will actually hide your gems and the idols are a nice addition. I never play this game seriously because it's no fun unless you make it fun. You have to get into the spirit of it.

Can't Stop with cards?  Not really.  You're not really playing the odds as much with this game as you are with its pappy.  Still, this is a push-your-luck game with a neat theme, and some of the coolest bits EVAR.  It requires a lot of shuffling, though, and tends to play longer than one would expect for such a light game.  In addition, this is a sort of game that improves with more players, since the extra chaos adds a higher entertainment level to the experience.

The Good: The cards are easier to shuffle in this version of the game, and the artifacts add another layer of reward to this push-your-luck game.  It's less expensive to purchase Incan Gold than it is to import a copy of Diamant.

The Bad: The components are a far cry from the original edition of the game, and the game looks a bit cheap by comparison.  The game is still nicely produced, and will undoubtedly stand up to a large number of plays, but crates and little plastic gems go a long way toward making this game fun to play.  Plus, you can use the artifact rule in the original version of the game without affecting the base rules that much.

The Verdict: Get Diamant.  If you can't do that, settle for Incan Gold.

A good push your luck type of game, with a twist, as there can be rewards for NOT pushing your luck. Interesting that game time will not increase with more players (due to simultaneous card reveals) but the game will play differently. I think that with more players there is incentive to not press forward as individual scoring is low, but the pool of gems on cards would be higher.

You and your fellow adventurers travel to Peru to find a ruined Incan temple and its treasures: turquoise, obsidian and gold. There are also rumors of valuable Incan artifacts. Will you chance dangers like giant spiders, mummies and fire during your search, or will you escape back to camp and safety, carrying out your loot?
\13\\13\
Incan Gold is a quick, fun and tense game in which you and other adventurers explore an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure. In each of the five rounds, you secretly choose if you want to continue exploring the temple in search of more treasure or retreat to the safety of your camp with your share of the treasure that has been discovered so far.
\13\\13\
Each time that an explorer braves new territory, more treasure or a danger appears. When a second type of the same danger is turned over, all exposed treasure is buried, leaving the remaining adventurers with nothing. Do you flee the dangerous temple with your portion of the treasure that has been uncovered so far or do you venture into the exciting temple in search of more hidden valuables?
\13\\13\
After five rounds of exploration, whoever has the most treasure is the ultimate explorer and winner!

This is a perfect nightcap game, when everyone is mentally burnt out from a long day of gaming (or drinking, for that matter). The rules are extremely easy to teach, with the players each making a single decision each turn, should I press on with the group or bail out? To complicate the decision, there is usually a fairly large pile of gems to be had for anyone tempted into leaving the group. This leads to some great table talk and plenty of cheers and groans as the group pushes their luck a hair too far or when someone sneaks away with the treasures after talking the group into opening just one more door.

There really isn't much to the game itself, but the fun it can generate with a lively group more than makes up for anything the game might lack in strategy. It almost always ends in laughter...and I can't think of any better praise than that.

I like efficient and fun small box games with a high player count. You can bring them to the table at any time as a filler or have them handy for spontaneous groups outside of committed game sessions. I'm beginning to keep these kinds of games in my car much of the time, just so that if the occasion ever arises, I have them ready.

Fantastic fun in ten minutes or less. My wife loves to keep "pulling the handle," as it were, never retreating from the mine until she's the last one inside and she's sitting on an enormous pile of gems. Needless to say, she dies most of the time, but every so often she wins by a disgusting margin. Her actions curve the play of everyone else and create an interesting group dynamic.

Played Diamant online and Incan Gold in person.

Fun, fast little game of push-your-luck.  The game is pure luck,  and doesn't overstay it's welcome (even when playing the max number of players) due to the simultaneous action selection,  and only having two choices.   

The bits in Incan gold are good,  except for the action selection cards,  which are far too similar to one another.

Basic gambling mechanic (deciding if you're in or out, essentially betting on the odds that the next card flipped will be either a treasure to increase your take-home winnings, and not a monster to send you screaming). Not much strategy or socializing, but quick and can have its moments of tension. Fun, light, easy, nothing wrong with it but nothing special.

Group push-your-luck family/filler card game. Indiana Jones theme.  Each round, go further in the temple and risk death or escape with the gems you have. Last explorer remaining can score big (but usually is never seen again). Reimplements Diamant which uses tiles and doesn't have artifacts. I prefer cards but the tiles add a nice feel and more to the thematic build up...  This game plays well 8 players which is the main reason I have it. But it is brainless. I feel like it could use some manipulation or take-that cards but I'm sure that would ruin the pure luck and odds of it.  But this is a small issue. This is a popular filler with our friends and family that is easily enjoyed with the kids joining in. I always stay in the temple too long. When will I learn?

Een lekker simpel push-your-luck spelletje. De spelers gaan met elkaar grotten verkennen waarin waardevolle diamanten en robijnen verborgen liggen. Deze grotten zijn echter ook niet zonder gevaar: rotsinstortingen en giftige slangen liggen op de loer om een einde te maken aan de expeditie.

Iedere keer wordt er een deel aangelegd van de grot. Dit kunnen schatten of een gevaar zijn. Hierna beslist iedereen of ze verder willen gaan of niet. Als je niet verder gaat raap je alle schatten die je onderweg al gevonden hebt op, maar je moet wel delen met alle andere mensen die terug gaan.

Was waiting for Incan Gold but found Diamant available for only a few dollars more.  Fun press your luck game that really doesn't need the theme for the game to play well, but it's a nice touch.  I can see how this game could play differently with different groups of people.  Thankfully we had a fun group to try it out with and it was well received.

RATING: 8
A reasonable test your luck game with a bit of a fiddle factor with the diamond allocation. Nevertheless our first game was with 4 and I think it's much better playing with more players (having played many games on BSW previously)..strangely though, I think the game plays better on bsw than ftf. The miner in your fist feels a bit contrived especially at the beginning 2-3 turns unless some decent gem cards are drawn..and it's quite fiddly diving up the booty, whereas online it's a click if you're in or out and the divies are automatically done on bsw..

Two or three plays with three that were okay and one play with five or six that just really bombed... It could be a good game, I just know it.  I really feel it depends on the group.  The game with 5 or 6 involved drinking and was with some non-gamers so maybe I set it up for failure.  I want this game to be good.  I'll bring this out when I play with the younger generation, I'm sure it'll be good then.

Friends played for the first time last night, they are non-gamers. But, with one trial run everyone had the rules. We all had a great time. Game is easy enough that kids as young as 6 could play. The fun is with the bits -- jewels, box car, and meeple. Then the tension of should I stay or should I go. But, best is the kidding between people over who chickened out and who stayed to long. We will be playing this again.

I can see this getting a lot of play as a nice, light filler that scales out well to 5-8 players -- a range for which I can't think of a comparably light, quick game. Diamant's brand of press-your-luck risks and rewards felt a lot like Cloud 9, but with simultaneous decisions to press on or jump ship, rather than going clockwise around the table. I like how the later rounds may encourage greater risks, not only for the allure of greater scores, but through removal of some of the hazard cards, potentially extending later rounds while shortening the deck. The gems, while attractive and thematic, are pretty clunky to deal with, especially when having to divide 15 gems by 6 people, etc.

I really enjoy this game now, after having found it underwhelming and rather mediocre on my first exposure to the game. It is a light and quick playing press your luck game with a good theme. Unfortunately the production values are not up to snuff. Most of the cards feature the same back, even though they have to be separated out - ugh! Then there's the fact that all card backs are black and white, and the turn counters are cards where you are directed to put artifacts under them for no reason. Oh, and you have to bend cards in order to use them as tents to hide your treasures.

Okay... Well, once you get over the poor components, this is a very fun party style game, and I definitely recommend it.

When teaching this game, people will think you stacked the deck, as you leave right before disaster befalls.  It's hard to lose on purpose.

Great family game. It's a non-game really, as you don't actually do anything else than choosing one of two alternatives, but it still feels thematic. I would definitely classify this one as a party game.

Incan Gold is a very good game, it is very cool. The rest of it is good, except for the zombies. :zombie: :shake:  Sometimes they scare me when the cards come out, but then we took them out.

This is a nice, simple press your luck game with a bit of reading other players too as figuring out when to go on and when to turn back is the only decision you're making in this game.  Pretty fun and handy to have around as an alternative to One Night Werewolf as a fast game for a large crowd.

Basically a press your luck game devoid of any skill or strategy.  The whole reveal your wooden worker to show your choice whether to keep excavating or run out gets old after a few turns.  Rather be spending my time doing something else.

Update #1: I keep getting roped into playing this even though I really hate it.  There's no doubt it's a popular filler, and an easy one to teach to children as well as non-gamers, but I don't want to be by rude sitting out when everyone else decide to participate.  /sigh.

A fluffy little press-your-luck game.  Highly random.  Primarily playable because it seats up to six and doesn't take long.

In the most recent version, the exit-the-mine and keep-exploring-the-mine cards are confusingly similar at first glance.

After 2+ Plays: I don't think I like push your luck games, as I just didn't find anything interesting about this game.

--I've played the new version (Incan Gold) and it did nothing to change my opinion.

--I've since found several push-your-luck games that I like quite a bit, such as Can't Stop and Cheeky Monkey, so if you hate this don't necessarily swear of the whole genre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
After 2+ Plays: I didn't like Diamant, and the minor changes here don't do anything to alter that fact.  The push-your-luck decisions are too straightforward, without the intersting texture of your decisions in for example Can't Stop or Cheeky Monkey.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A push-your-luck game that really shines with several players. Everyone is going into a cave, and each tile either has treasure or a hazard. If two of the same hazard show up, everyone still in the cave gets nothing. You can duck out after any tile, but as people leave, the remaining players get more treasure. I absolutely love the treasure/danger buildup that occurs with several players, and it is fantastic to watch a player stock up their cache of jewels then lose it to a sudden disaster.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
Incan gold is a simple, entertaining filler. It's a press-your-luck mechanic where you can try and go deeper for more gems, but with a higher threat of losing everything. The gems and artifacts left behind in the tunnels complicate the decision slightly because you can leave on your own and grab all the leftovers, but it's hard to gauge when your opponents will bail for the growing leftover spoils.

The actual final scoring can be anticlimactic if one player  had a few strong outings early on, and it's tough to fall behind early because the leader can keep taking risks in order to prevent a runaway tunnel leading to a comeback, but the fun in the game is in the individual treks, not the final scoring.

RATING: 9
The best filler since Ricochet Robots and more fitting for people who don't want to strain their brain. Draw cards that represent a dungeon. Cards either show diamonds that are fairly distributed among those still in the dungeon, or dangers, that will cause all explorers in the dungeon to run home, losing all diamonds, if the same danger appears twice. Before each card, all players decide simultaneously if they go home (and thus securing the diamonds they have amassed so far) or continue. Also, those who go home get to snag the diamonds that have been left (those who couldn't be divided).
Absolutely wonderful game of "what the hell's the others going to do?". Most ingenous design for a simple game I've ever seen.

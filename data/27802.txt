GAME: Anno 1701: Das Kartenspiel
RANK: 4651
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Ein weiteres sehr nettes Kartenspiel für 2 Personen. Es ist eine Mischung aus den normalen Siedler Kartenspielen und dem Siedler Kartenspiel Sternfahrer. Ich denke das umschreibt es am besten. Außerdem scheint es mir ausgewogener zu sein, so das die Spiele eher spannend sind.

It drags on too long, and has a runaway leader problem, which can occur due to lucky/unlucky dice-rolls. No, this was not at all as good as Siedler Kartenspiel.

Based on the principles of the Settlers of Catan Cardgame and the Anno 1701 computer game players are pioneers trying to develop their island as best as possible - starting out with only 2 houses. Victory points are won for controlling settlers and citizens.

Played this game 3 times. Not having played SoC:cardgame, first game was a bit hard to see what was going on, and made a rule error about forgetting that you can trade 3:1, which made the game drag on quite a bit. However second and third play game still lasted way too long (90 minutes or so), too frustrating, too much random, not enough control, not very interesting choices to make. Disappointed in this game.

This two player card game has very similar mechanics to the Settlers of Catan card game. I like that, and I like this, probably just a little bit better. I found it to be a little "tighter" playing. You don't keep expanding outward, rather you go on voyages. Those are enough of a twist to make the resource gathering fun and exciting. It also seems to add another layer to the way you develop your settlements. Still, as with Catan card game, this is just a little too long for what it is.

Based on the same priciple than Catan Card Game but shorter and a little bit simpler. Nice game for two players.

I rate it 7 because of my experience in playing PC game Anno 1701 - the theme just appeals to me. Otherwise it would get an average 6. Try it or not - a game like many others.

Not a bad game. City management in 1 vs 1, although I don't like the dice part. Anyway, really different from Catan "father". Really prefer other games for 2.
If luck goes to one of the players or get any high advantage somehow, it's hard to equalize the game then

If you like the settlers card game, you'll like this one as well. It's easier to learn if you know the boardgame "anno 1503" as it has many components from this game. I think the transformation from the board- to the cardgame worked very well.

Anno 1701 is based on the Catan Card Game "engine" but buildings don't generate VPs. In this game you need to develop your pioneers to settlers [1 VP] to citizens [2 VPs] to merchants [3 VPs] - you win with either 2 merchants or 7 VPs.
In order to do so, you need to trade with other people to be able to buy rum and cigars. That requires using your ship to sail out: a mechanism borrowed from the Starfarers Card game. You meet along the way pirates, bad weather, ... and trading people where you can buy rum & cigars.
So plenty of stuff to do: collect raw materials to build buildings, and improve your ship with sails and canons.
There's limited "harm" players can do unto each other, which is way my wife likes this more than the SoC Card game.
Down side: a typical game takes 1.5 to 2 hours!

OK Settlers card game variation.  Would like to see a bigger 'sailing' deck, and the cards were very difficult for me to read easily.  The artwork seemed more distracting, or something.  I also felt the game takes about 30 minutes longer than it should.  But still, would not refuse a game.

Mix 2 parts Catan Card game, 1 part Anno 1503 board game and a small shot of new ideas, and you've got this game.  solid Teuber game, similar but different enough from the Catan card game. Could be a tad faster (like the Catan card game).

The game seems to have only one path to victory and therefore feels very scripted. 
A two-player "try-before-you-buy".

Bleh. Rather derivative of the Settlers card game, without the different possible routes to victory. Far fewer different cards, options and choices. Still it lasts about as long as the Settlers card game (without expansions), so why would I ever want to play this?

Fun two player Catan-ish game (although we never trade with each other).

Quite a bit of luck on the dice rolls for resources and what you get on your shipping expeditions, but if you're expecting that, you should be fine. Can be dealt with by getting and building cards to help you out in those areas. Cannons are especially important.

The game always seems to run long for us, however. I'm sure part of that is the German on the cards, as we haven't played it enough to remember everything, so we need player aids. Maybe with better aids we'd be faster.

Played once. Since I like the Settlers card game and had been pleasantly surprised by the Anno 1701 boardgame, I expected quite a lot of this one, but I was rather disappointed. It feels too long, and too much of the same over and over, for what it is. There is only one way to obtain victory points (unlike the Settlers card game), and having to go through numerous expeditions to purchase the necessary warehouse goods is a tedious process. Furthermore, replayability is likely to be an issue, considering there are so few decisions on a strategic level.

LIKE: A bit faster, streamlined from the original. Lots of strategy. I like the simple, quick turns around the rondel.
DISLIKE: Attacking is not my thing, and that type of tension isn't fun for me.

OVERALL: It's a mild wargame that takes more than war to win, but I cannot find that strategy. It's an ok game for me at best. There are other games I prefer.

RATING: 5
A slightly boring race for points disguised as an area control. In its core, the game is just a question, who is the first to do this and that. Actions are selected on a rondel which is usually a very neat mechanic that makes you ponder all the trade-offs. But here this was not the case, since most of the time the best choice was obvious and you did not miss the actions you skipped.

I also did not fancy all the grinding. You spend several rounds collecting resources in small quantities before you can actually do anything meaningful. At least, Antike II does not suffer from the typical race game disease. By this I refer to sudden endings when one player pulls a zillion VPs on one turn triggering the game end.

Antike II is by no means a bad game but I did not find enough meaningful decision making in it.

RATING: 8
This is my third rondel game and also the simpliest implementation of this mechanism so far... Three actions are for taking resources, three are to spend them and one is used to move and fight. It's so simple, but yet again Mac Gerdts proves himself to be a great designer. I'm really impressed by the fact that, using the same mechanism, he manages to create games that feel so different.

Antike II offers the same smooth gameplay with very quick turns, but it's a completely different game compared to other Mac Gerdts' designs. I like to think about Antike as a 4X eurogame. You have to expand your civilization, discover new technologies, fight for the control of the territory... but everything with deterministic euro mechanics. Yet what I like the most about Antike is the fact that you get victory points by achieving various objectives. This is such an unique and interesing idea... and also even thematic! I love that, when I'm done playing, I can see what my civilization has done and achieved during the course of the game.

Overall Antike II is a great game. It's probably not the deepest Mac Gerdts' design gameplay-wise, but I'm so glad to own a copy of this new streamlined edition.

1st play: Another Gerdts rondel game.  I liked the openness of the actions and the race elements to scoring points for achievements.  Having played Concordia, it's a better system.  I did like the multiple resource types and the unique uses for each resource.  We ended it at 6 points instead of 7 but it felt like our engines were just getting started more than I expected.

No second play, didn't seek it out.

I was not as smitten with Antike II as Concordia, but once again Mac Gerdts shows the sheer elegance of his design. Headache-free area control, rondel action selection, resource production, and civilization building with mechanics that become second nature yet offer numerous paths to victory as you vie for those personages. The fact you've got two boards with slightly different configurations is the kicker. Really fantastic game which you could introduce someone into accessible Euros that do not lack for depth.

RATING: 6
A régi Antike egy variánsaként fogható fel. Kevesebb pontot adok rá, mert nem úgy sikerült szerintem, ahogy szerették volna. A lényeg, hogy a harci stratégiát próbálták meg háttérbe szorítani, de mi már a régiben is azt éreztük, hogy túl erős a fejlesztés, ez itt most hatványozottan igaz. A régiben volt, hogy az elejétől a végéig ütöttem egy ellenfelet, végig max 5 városa volt, mégis simán nyert a fejlesztésekkel. Itt az a helyzet, hogy ha nem közel egyenlően osztozunk a 8 fejlesztésen (3 fő esetén kell érteni a leírtakat, ahol ez 3-3-2) akkor aki többet szerez, félig meddig nyerő. Vagyis mindenkinek muszáj rámenni a fejlesztésre az elején, mert azzal a legkönnyebb pontot szerezni. Főleg hogy a játék első felében a seregek drágulása és a kezdeti védettség miatt tök esélytelen a támadás.

Konkrétan néhány újdonság:
-fejlesztések árnyaltabbak, az pl. tetszik, hogy nem lehet 3-at mozogni semmiképp egy körben. Cserébe a manőver akció egyszerűsödött.
-a város nélküli mezők a szárazföldön a taktikai lehetőségeket szinesítik, a tengerben pedig változik a tengerész szerzés módja.
-a bellonlap, ami megy körbe, nálunk nem sok vizet kavart
-3 szabad templom nem rossz ötlet, főleg hogy az utolsó pontot templompusztításért mindenképp megkapjuk, akkor is ha elfogytak a személyiségek.
-a seregek 2 vasba kerülnek, ahogy fentebb is írtam, ez szerintünk agyonüti az egészet. Igaz mi csak 3-an próbáltuk, ennél a létszámnál vannak legtávolabb a népek egymástól, gondolom a többi létszámnál kicsit esélyesebb a sereges taktika.

I played the original Antike some time ago and really enjoyed it way back then. However I have recently been revisiting old favourites and have been disappointed at how poor they compare with more modern offerings. It was with some trepidation that I jumped back in.

But I shouldn't have worried. Mac is a very safe pair of hands and he remains one of my favourite designers.  The rondel is a lovely mechanism and the rebalance that has been applied to Version 2 really does add the extra gloss to an already shiny product. I need to find the upgrade kit at Essen.

As a fan of rondel gamnes, I thought this one was quite well done.  I guess my biggest concern is that the game feels a little flat, in that it's difficult to catch up to other players if you fall behind.

Also, the theme is incredibly bland.  YARG  (yet another Rome game).  Initial rating 7, but room for improvement.

Differences between original Antike are pretty minimal, but they do make a difference, and they are welcome. It still just seems a little weird to me that the game looks like a war game, but typically there is actually very minimal fighting. In the game I played last night, there was only one attack the entire game, which was by the player who won, on their final turn.

I only played the original antike once at 4, but this felt a lot more balanced. I played the phoenecians the first time and spent most of the game panicking as people pressed in on all sides. The removal of triple move is probably a good thing, though I didn't play enough of the original to be sure. I like the double navigator spaces.

RATING: 6
I had mixed feelings about the new multiplayer version of Antike before release (actually, I still have), particularly after I read that unfortunately, Antike II doesn't have the event cards known from Antike Duellum. I love the excellent Antike Duellum for 2 players, but personally don't usually like multiparty games where it frequently happens that two (or more) parties fight each other and a third party wins as a consequence. See the 8th of the general preferences in my profile for more details on my take on this.

I was pleasantly surprised by Antike II after getting to know the new rules and playing the first game at SPIEL 2014 in Essen. Sure, it is a game where the nations/players can fight each other and if the other players gang up on you or one player is intent on dragging both of you down, your chances of winning decrease dramatically. This and the lack of event (action) cards are the main reasons I don't rate the game higher. However, the incentives to attack other players aren't as strong as I feared. There is quite a lot of room for peaceful development, because conflict is expensive. In the important early game, this is true particularly thanks to the great novelty to give nations with 2 or fewer personages +1 to defense strength of all cities, also offering interesting strategical choices when to score your 3rd personage. Moreover, the three neutral temples usually pose an easier target than an opponent's. As soon as a nation has both defense know-hows (at which point it has very likely lost the defense bonus for no more than 2 personages), conquering a city from it costs 6 iron - which is twice as many resources as founding a new city. Because you only harm between 20% (with 6 players) and 50% (with 3 players) of your opponents, this often isn't particularly attractive. But there is obviously more room for conquests before a nation develops the defense know-hows, particularly if it was careless enough to be in a vulnerable position when reaching 3 personages.

I really regret that Antike II doesn't have the event cards known from Antike Duellum. They would have needed to be somewhat rebalanced for multiplayer, of course. But then they would have gone a long way to a) avoid railroaded openings which are preplanned to the last detail and b) compensate players for aggressive play of one neighbor.
Antike Duellum's town walls would have been nice to have in Antike II as well.

In any case, I like Antike II hugely better than the old Antike, particularly because of the old Antike's very cheap, half price for arming military units (one instead of two iron), its missing defense bonus with no more than 2 personages and its missing neutral temples. All this makes fighting against other players *a lot* more frequent, the character of the game will usually be completely different. Even when an opponent has the know-how for defense +2, you still only need to spend 3 iron to conquer an undefended city - which are only as many resources as founding one! But it comes with the added bonus of substantially harming one of your opponents. Before the opponents have both defense know-hows, attacking them seems so extremely strong, that it looks [i]completely[/i] over the top to me.

The "historically flavored" background of the game is a nice bonus for me. I also like the historical information booklet, which nicely supplements the historical theme.

A downside of the game is that some nations don't seem to be situated quite balanced enough on the map for my taste. One main reason for this seems to be the fact that moving their cities on the map between different player numbers wasn't possible particularly fine-tuned, because they were only moved to the three correct printed starting resources. I would have preferred if the nation cards could have overriden the printed starting resources for the starting cities. After all, it wouldn't be a problem to put a different resource city token on them. This would have made possible a more balanced setup for all player numbers.

I prefer the Orient map over the Mare Nostrum map, at least when playing without the variant "Free choice of city types". Primarily because it includes the variable production cities which can provide for interesting strategy decisions when founding cities and, what's more, which help to smooth out inequalities of the starting positions. But also because it has 55 instead of 50 city regions, which allows for a little more peaceful development before "having" to attack opponents.
However, the Mare Nostrum map may be interesting to play for a change as well. One change is to simply have a different map with different starting positions, the other and probably more important one is that a strategy specializing on gold is harder to implement without the variable production cities.

So far, I prefered to play with the "Nine scholars" variant, particularly because it allows for one more peaceful personage to be scored. But playing without the variant seems to have its merits, too, as it makes specializing on gold production weaker (or rather avoids strengthening it with the variant). I would like to try out playing without the variant in the next game(s).
I am not yet sure what I think about the variant "Free choice of city types". I haven't tried it out so far, but would like to in the next game(s), particularly because it seems to help to lessen imbalances between the starting positions. An argument against using it would be if it makes specializing on (almost) exclusively founding gold cities dominant, so it seems best to try it without the "Nine scholars" variant first.

My family seems to really like Mac's designs. And this was no exception. It's the third of his game's we've picked up: Imperial, Concordia, and now this one. 

Even though this one has direct conflict potential (as does Imperial) it went over well.

I love the wood components, the map of Europe and the Orient on the other side. Not tired of the Rondel mechanism- it works well. However I will say this one isn't as good as in Imperial because the economy bloats toward game end in this game and pretty much you can select anything you want, which makes predicting player's move limits more difficult than in Imperial and sort of defeats the point of it? But only a little...

Seems a little focused on initial Temple building to win the game, but haven't played it enough to test alternate routes to victory.

Fun!

Simple civilization builder in which everything is in your own hands (no dice throwing or card drawing). Play seems nicely balanced. The game can be won by playing agressively or peacefully. Points are scored for building temples, early technological advances, expanding your empire, temporary marine superiority, and...destroying temples of other nations. Focusing on just one of these possibilities is a sure way of losing the game.There are just 3 resources: marble, iron and gold, the three of which you need to build new cities. Marble is further necessary to build temples, iron to build armies, and gold to advance technologically. Coins can be used to replace any of the 3 resources.

Antike II is a challenging strategy game about evolution and competition among ancient civilizations. Ancient nations create cities, build temples, sail the seas, and discover new principles of science and technology. Their legions and galleys open new settlements and defend their people against attacks from their enemies. Two scenarios can be chosen as the game board is two-sided.
Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves. The nation that acquires a specified number (depending on the number of players) of ancient personalities first wins the game!

RATING: 7.9
Very good area control game, with a taste of civilization and wargame at the same time!
Very easy to teach and play: There are only a few actions to choose from and they are always available (if you have the resources needed) through a rondel system.
The battle results are very easy to calculate and there is the appeal of the race for the cards goals (victory conditions).
The map art and the theme feeling are very well achieved, with all those real latin names used in the town names, actions and characters!...
An unpleasent drawback of the game is the same flaw that strikes Risk (for instance): While some players fight among them, another player at the other corner of the map runs to victory and there is nothing you can do to avoid it because you are just too far away...

Fun game, but aggression is perhaps a bit too hard once you get those defence techs in place. Other than that it's a good balance between expansion, building temples and teching up. You probably need all of them to win but can concentrate on one or two above the others.

RATING: 8
Players take on one of several ancient civilizations, and expand, build and culture their way to victory.  Turns are super quick - basically advance a dobber on the "roundel" and take the action you land on (take resources, build temples, troops, get smarter, or go conquer stuff).  You earn "historic personages", a nice name for victory points, for achieving goals.  The first half of the game is fun as you grow your empire, then the head butting begins.  The game works very well, and it only takes about 30 seconds to take your turn.  However it can slow down and get a bit stuck late in the proceedings as those last few points are struggled over.  Looks very nice in action.  Second edition cleans up a few things, and as long as you don't over play it, it's a fun game.

RATING: 6
A re-release of Antike which I had never played.  This is a classic Mac Gertdz rondel game with confrontation thrown into the mix.   To win you have to gain 8 VPs and a VP is gained when you take a card for achieving a certain criteria (eg you are in 5 territories, or you win 3 battles against temples, or you develop a technology first).    The game offers different strategies to acquire the VPs, whether it be through confrontation or empire builing, naval dominance and so on.  So far so good.  The problem arises toward the end game.  Generally whichever strategy you adopt you will all be hitting the target VPs minus two at a similar time.  Now it is a race for the final 2 VPs.  Given that the VP cards for each achievement are limited you will now be in a position where only cards in a couple of targets are left.   What therefore we now have is a race to acquire those cards. 
 
The overall feeling is that it is a game of two parts (though not equal in length).  The first, longer section of the game, involves building up your VPs in a considered and strategic way.  Then you reach that point at which you have done everything you can do easily, as has everyone else.  Now each game move is about preventing an opponent from winning (so there are potentially Kingmaker aspects at this stage), or racing to achieve the final cards that are left by achieving whatever criteria they demand.

In summary:  as a Mac Gertdz design not nearly as good as Navegador, Hamburgum or Concordia.

Having never played the original Antike and generally steering clear of Mac Gerdtz games simply because of the box size, I picked this up on the basis of the glowing remarks as well as the theme/setting (which is loosely-applied, of course).

This is one of the most straight-forward strategy games I have ever played, but that doesn't mean it's easy or light filler.  There are some great decisions to make for all players and while it's a little more peaceful than its 2p cousin, Duellum, there's plenty of room for aggression and competition.  It plays extremely fast and doesn't get bogged down in its own ruleset.  I cannot comment on the differences between this one and the original, but I have nary a complaint about it.  Great game.  Will have to check out his other ones like Concordia or Navegador.

I played Antike a few times back in 2007/2008 and never really enjoyed it all that much, but bought Antike II because I really wanted another 2-hour, six-player, low-luck Euro. Antike II doesn't shake up the formula too much -- it's still a simplistic, abstracted Civ-lite -- but all of the adjustments are welcome (I look forward to trying the Orient map with its resource selection mechanism). While I can respect Mac Gerdt's start here, Antike II is certainly not up to the level of his masterpiece, Imperial, or even Navegador.

Elsőre a a duellumot próbáltam, ami nem annyira tetszett, mert túl kötött és így már elsőre is unalmas volt. Reméltem, hogy itt az interakció sokat lendít majd a dolgon, de ez sajnos nem teljesen jött be. Hatan ültünk neki, és így tényleg érdekesebb volt valamivel, de ez kicsit csak látszat dolog. Rájöttem, hogy nem szeretem a rondellát. Túl mechanikus, túl behatárolt. Biztos azért is érzem így, mert nem igazán sikerült még ráéreznem arra - a valószínűleg - 2-3 körre, amikor tényleg megéri nagyokat ugrani rajta a cél érdekébe. Az is fájt, hogy nem igazán támogatja a játék a konfrontációt. Vagyonokat költhetsz hadseregre, ami még sikeres foglaláskor is megy a levesbe, és ezzel nyersz plusz egy várost magadnak, valakitől meg elveszel egyet, a többi 4 játékos meg röhög rajtatok, és ugyanennyi idő alatt csinál magának akár 2 pontot is, ráadásul simán lezúznak téged, meg a háborúzós társadat is, ha akarnak. Talán az jobb lenne, ha győztes csata esetén nem kéne a teljes veszteséget elszenvedni.
Ami viszont dicséretes volt, hogy 6 fővel is - aminek a fele teljesen újonc volt - lement 2 óra alatt. Az elemi rondellás lépések miatt pörgött a játék, szinte nem volt holtidő. Ez nagyon ritka az ilyen komolyságú játékoknál, ennyi fővel. Szóval nagy társaságoknak mindenképp ajánlott lehet.

RATING: 8
Still enjoy this game very much.  It feels like it must be a battle game, but a lot of interest comes from the ongoing brinkmanship and then knowing when best to strike.  I love that you can pursue different viable strategies, and all feel pretty balanced. Though you also have to be aware of what your opponents are doing and make sure they don't capitalize too much in one sphere.  I also love how the board starts blank and then develops steadily from there.  Best part of Antike is how fast the turns move, especially for a game of this scope.  And it has a perfect timer as well so the game doesn't go on for too long.  Great, great game.  Compared to the first edition, I think the second edition nicely streamlines some battle events and also limits the chance that the game will end in an explosion of war that occurs after many rounds of brinkmanship (which is how the first edition would usually conclude). Overall it's the exact same feel as the original.

First play. 3 of us, all experienced Antike players. The changes made to Antike II are all improvements. Nothing radical but also nothing to spoil one of my favorite games. I see no reason why anyone would play the original Antike over this version but only diehards need both. Oct 2014

*UPDATE* 5 Plays in and I'm loving it. All games seem to end with an abrupt 2 point grab by the lead player to take them over the line. Keeps the play experience sharp and exhilarating. Games have been taking us an average of 2 hours. Played this version with 3,4 and 6 players and all counts work equally for me. Feb 2015

*UPDATE* The 3 player game often ends without combat. It is a double sided board, the second side should have been a map with fewer territories for use when playing with 3 or 4. A smaller map would make the low player count games more exciting. April 2016

*UPDATE* 10th playing of this new addition and much as I like the changes made to the game it is still prone to a poor play experience if all players don't take responsibility for hitting on their neighbor. One weak/inexperienced player potentially spoils the entire game. I consider Antike one of my all time favorite games but I might be in love with the elusive perfect competitive playing and ignoring the reality of the typical playing. May 2016

*UPDATE* In combination I have played Antike I and II over 30 times. I am finally done with it. The end game is never quiet satisfactory being decided by colluding rather than stratagising. The second addition is a slight improvement over the first. I will leave the rating at a respectful 8. May 2017

I can't decide about this one. One thing I do know, there is considerable opportunity to mess with each other. The problem is that if two players fight, the winners are those players who do not fight. Our first game was not fun due to this. Second game no attacks, just a lot of bluffing, we had more fun with this. The game is OK but I think that other games do the Mediterranean economic/military theme better (I am talking about you Mare Nostrum)

RATING: 7.5
This game reminded me a lot of a mix between Navegador and Concordia (perhaps appropriately, all three are by the same designer) but with combat thrown in. I think for my tastes it's the worst of the three, but not by much. The rondel is a nice action selection mechanism, and the way that the correpsonding actions are opposite each other adds a nice wrinkle. And it seems like focusing on any of the three resources to start should work, and all three seem fun. Temples make all of your cities much stronger overall, the science powers are interesting, and the deterministic combat seems to work well. The only downside is that it's all a bit too simple. There are too few moving parts for my taste, and once you start going down one route at least for the first bit of the game there didn't seem to be much to think about. It's a solid game but for me there are better ones that fill a similar enough role.

Update: After playing again with the benefit of time, and seeing the end game play out in sort of a weird way that I don't really remember from my last game, I've knocked it down a bit. Basically, there are certain goals that are easiest, and everyone goes for them until they run out, and then they all have to pivot to the next easiest one until they all run out, and in our game, we ran out of a goal with everyone one or two away from the end game, and then the end felt like it really dragged while someone tried to eke out that last objective. We got to the point where a few people were out of it and the prospect of kingmaking came into play and we decided to just call it. Maybe this is more of a problem at higher counts though, I don't know. But it was sort of a weird and unsatisfying endgame.

Update 2: Ok, so the reason the endgame from the last game was weird was because we played with some rules wrong, and those rules directly added to a weird endgame. This explains why I didn't see this last time (it's been about a year). Rating back up to the original value.

In a few plays, I like the changes over Antike (my previous favorite game).  The change to the conquest rules makes it flow smoother, as does, imho, getting a coin with production instead of at the beginning of each round.  Like the original, if not more so, there are many paths to victory.  In one game, I was half a turn short of a win with Roma in a 6-player game, with virtually no military.

The original Antike, owned and played many moons ago, introduced my group to Mac Gerdts rondel mechanic. We found the action mechanic very cool, but the end game was seriously problematic - almost broken. Soon after we played Imperial - a far superior game - and never looked back. I picked this up off the sale rack thinking this might be worth revisiting if the endgame was fixed. 

And I think it is better, for sure. I suspect there are quite a few changes in this version, but they are all mostly tweaks and don't change the overall sense of playing the game, which is good. However, the goals system for determining the winner is still in place. The goals you need to achieve to win get more difficult to accomplish towards the end and slows the game way down. The fact that temples run out, that it is difficult and slow to build an army to attack or defend with, and that if you focus on any one threatening opponent it simply opens the door for another -- all of this is just a bit more frustrating that fun, for me. It's not a bad game overall and I see why some like it, but no...

Was not sure to get the upgrade pack or buy the full game.

Luckily I didn't buy the upgrade kit since the people who bought it have complained since it is supposedly incomplete.

Didn't get the full game either as I still have to play my old copy of Antike.

Some people echo that it is an improvement but reading in the description that you now can win without to attack other players ... Well I don't know if that is an improvement for this type of game.

To each their own.

PS : I can't rate it. since I haven't played it. I post this as a warning for people interested in the upgrade pack. Is it really so bad ? Look further into it .

and people who want the original antike experience. The games allows pacifist play. While I agree on the pacifist idea I don't think that the game should be playable that way. It's antike.

A solid, simple civilization game that has been updated and streamlined.  You gather iron, gold and marble to build out your civ.  You use armies and navies to found new cities and grow your empire.  As you grow you gain victory points for cities, temples, destroying temples, expanding in the sea.  

It is a fun game with the Mac Gerdts rondel mechanic and a simple tech tree.  I do wonder about replayability.  But the initial play was fun.  When comparing with other Mac Gerdts games, I like Concordia and Imperial better, but think this is a solid game.

08/29/15 Played a four-player game in 1.75 hours.
As a veteran of Antike (I) I was interested to see how the rules and map changes affected play. In brief they were collectively a wash to me. I'd be more than happy to play Antike II again, yet I have no intention of selling my first edition or ceasing to play it. I do prefer the "eastern" map of my edition that goes farther east. The two maps in Antike II overlap too much. So basically I rated it the same as I rated Antike (I).

Not too much different from [gameid=19600]. A quick civ game where you can battle other players but those battles need to be chosen wisely as gearing up for war is expensive.

Seems to improve on Antike in many ways. One of the most important is having a more sensible box: this should keep the contents inside even when traveling. The difficult box was one of the main reasons the first edition didn't see enough play it otherwise deserved.

The changes in rules seem very reasonable, and make this game even better than it was before. Very good!

This rondel game is a reworking of the original Antike. I like it, it's fairly clean and easy to play. The original Antike was long and had some flaws, in that there was a first player advantage. In this version, the designer tries to address that by giving the last player the card that has an extra build, then the card rotates to the second last player. I would rather everyone have an equal number of turns, then compare scores. 

It's fun, and it will be interesting to see how future games play out.

When Antike Duellum was published, I liked the changes it brought, and when I heard a new edition of Antike was to be published, I guessed (and hoped) AD was the direction Antike would drift to. And that was finally the case, but no to the extent I was expecting. What were the changes?
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1255439/rule-changes-antike-i

The overall gameplay still is Antike, but the changes are noticeable. I think all of them are positive changes, especially the simplification of movement and attacking cities, and the possibility to decide the production type of every city you found. This is an optional rule we didn't use (one of the new board maps offer this in a limited level: you can choose the production of certain specific cities).

played once with three - as expected, with that number the board is open, allowing players to ignore each other, or at least avoid direct conflict for much of the game - it was only at the end we saw any real conflict;  I'm sure this would be better with a larger group

 The rules are very 'elegant/simple'.  I generally don't like longer games that are this simple and this is no exception.

*達成特定條件拿得分卡並記錄得分3/4/5/6人率先拿到10/9/8/7分的獲勝，如果差一分不管有沒有卡仍可藉由毀滅神廟得分
*遊戲輪流移動轉論到行動格做行動，第一棟隨便放之後前三格免費，之後每多一步一個資源，行動完後有兵或船的空地可蓋對應城市(支付三種資源各一)，中立神廟要被毀滅才能蓋城市，回合結束符合條件就拿卡得分
*錢是百搭
>生產資源 每個城市產一個對應資源，有神廟的產3個，然後在獲得1圓，如果沒錢可任選1資源拿
>產兵或船每個2鐵，每個城市只能一次產一個，有神廟可產3個，產兵不能馬上戰鬥，藍邊緣的能產船，紅色的產兵
>花5個大理石在有城市的地方蓋神廟，可一次蓋多棟
>發展科技 花金錢買，第一個買的用高價但會拿牌，之後買的低價，前三個要先買前面才能買後面，可一次發展多個
>移動 每個單位移動1步，如果遇到敵軍雙方只要有人想戰鬥就會戰鬥，1:1對消，如果結束後在敵方城市，所有兵力大於防禦力，付掉對應兵力可占領該城市(變你的)，城市防禦力1(有寺廟的3)，所有兵1，在根據分數或科技增加，有神廟就毀掉，中立神廟也是3，剩一座城市就不能被占領

On paper, the changes to Antike all sound like improvements, but after my first play, I'm not so sure.  It seems like now the strategy of just aggressively getting gold and buying the know-hows is overly powerful.  Since legions/galleys are now so expensive, it means that a person pursuing a gold strategy can get a huge jump on victory points and know-how capabilities before anyone following a different strategy can build up a force and pose a threat.

I'm looking forward to hearing the reviews from more experienced Antike players who spend several sessions with this one, putting it through the paces, and seeing whether anything is out of balance or broken.

I know the original Antike was developed and fine-tuned over many years, and I'm just not certain yet that Antike II has been as well-tested.

Wonderful replacement for Risk. There is absolutely no chance and all strategy. It's a nice military/global expansion/ resource management game. Imagine if Catan had military and you took out the dice. If you need more of a resource you go get it. Not a complete military game, but in the end I would be surprised if you didn't start killing people. I've only played one game where no one attacked. It was terrible. I think we had 3 players.

RATING: 5.5
09-04-2015. Rated after 1 play. Antike II might be described as Risk without dice. In the game, you aim to score a certain number of VPs based on the number of players.

You earn VPs for owning 5, 10, 15 etc cities, 3, 6, 9 temples. Having ships on 7 sea spaces.. Destroying temples from opponents or be the first to build a new technology, that no one else has built. The game revolves around the rondel, which is basically an action wheel which you can move 3 steps, or pay extra to move more. Using the wheel, you get Marble, Gold or Iron, build new troops, temples and move your troops around. Making the game more interesting than diceless risk.

Combat is very easy, you basically just kill a guy to remove a guy from an opponent. Guy can be ships as well :P. You don't have to engage in combat, but you may.

The game bombed on my first play. I have good hopes for repeated plays though. We took 2 hours with 4 players in a new group. I think that's respectable. It does feel a little like Imperial 2030 though, but without the nice stock mechanism and the getting money. I think I might prefer that game over Antike so far.

Take Antike and refine and improve it for the better, then you have Antike II. With a couple of tweaks it's a little easier to get the winning VP. The battles have been simplified. Coins added for production makes the game flow better, without making it too easy. There's still the feeling that three is one player too few and six is one too many, but this is a really good game in this genre. Fast moving turns and 60-90 minute games. Planning. Options. Easy to learn, teach and play. This has a permanent place in my collection.

Great game. The rondel helps the game move forward and there is little downtime. Play can seem a little mechanical after a while but the game doesn't outstay it's welcome. Several paths to victory, and no need for aggressive play until possibly nearing the latter stages. It might have been interesting to see the personages have special abilities, but that might be overkill. It's an enjoyable fast paced game as it is. My other Rondel game is Navegador, for which I have a preference because there seems more of a narrative with the eastward advance of the ships, but both are great games.

Could've been a decent game. Coins make resources far too plentiful leaving the player with no sense of tension over their choices because no matter what you can probably do everything you want anyway. The board is also far too large for 3 players. I backed my way to victory never even coming in contact with either of my opponents. This could be fixed with the Small World treatment of scaling the map to the player number. I literally left this game wondering if it had even been play tested at all. Add to that this is the second edition I come to the conclusion that this is the poorest design in board game history.

In [thing=124361][/thing] he showed us that you can create deep strategy games with ridiculously simple rules, and with this game how demonstrates this ability again. Everything is just so streamlined and straightforward... except the strategies! Every action in and of itself is so simple, but the ways in which you can combine them open up such possibilities and strategies. Great stuff.
This game does include [thing=24181][/thing] style combat, which I'm quite fine with. And you don't have to fight to win, but in certain situations it can certainly be beneficial.
In our game all of us where at 8 points before I squeezed out a victory. It was just incredibly close.
It seems we did play a rule wrong - remove armies after conquering a city - but I don't think that would have influenced my win as I didn't do much with the armies after I used them to conquer - which I only did twice in the game with different units. Just saying :)
Oh, just to clarify: [thing=19600][/thing] is his only title I hadn't played yet. I still haven't, but I don't think I need to now that I have this one.

Didn't know what to expect based on reading reviews and comments, but I was pleasantly surprised. So far Mac Gerdts has a fantastic track record with me.

This is basically Imperial but they have removed the part that I didn't like, which is the whole stock market element. You just try to meet certain goals to gain points (get a lot of cities, build temples, research, control the seas) until someone gets enough points to win. Really simple, really elegant (which is a hallmark of Gerdts).

The main mechanism is action selection via a rondel. Half of the actions let you gain resources, and the other half let you spend those resources. There are also spaces that let you move your army units. And that's really it. The rules are all on one fold-out sheet, plus a set-up sheet.

Combat is interesting here because it is very costly, so you really don't see as much combat as you would probably expect in this type of game. You really just see occasional attacks for someone to either gain a point or to keep an opponent from getting easy points.

The last thing I want to mention is the speed of play. I played a six-player game with everybody learning the game, including me as the rules explainer, and the game just flew by. The rondel really works here to keep the game moving smoothly. After seeing the box and having the game explained we thought this may end up being a slog, but we were all impressed by how fast the game moved along.

Sold.

The rondel is awesome and your turn comes by in a flash. I really like it. Some starting positions are much better than other though.

Replaced by Concordia.

[thing=166857][/thing] is, basically, [thing=24181][/thing]-lite. It has the Mac Gerdts' trademark - the rondel - and it function much like [thing=24181][/thing]: actions are chosen in the rondel, the player can choose any action up to three spaces for free, or pay 1 resource for each step beoynd three required to reach the place the player wants. The actions are:

- [b]Ferrum, Aurum, Marmor[/b]: gain resource (iron, gold and marble, respectively) accordingly to the number of cities you have with the symbol of the resource + 1 coin (which serves as a wild resource).

- [b]Movere[/b] x2: move troops and/or ships one adjacent space. If the troops/ships pass a space with an opponent unit(s), the players, one at a time, may decide to battle, and the losses are in the 1:1 basis.

- [b]Militia[/b]: build troops or ships (costs 2 iron for each). It must be put in a place where the player has a city, and no more than one troop or ship per city (or up to three, if the city has a Temple).

- [b]Scientia[/b]: develop technologies by paying the cost in gold. There are eight possible techs: Mercatura (6/2) -> Commercium (9/4); Metallum (9/5) -> Moneta (12/7); Regnum (10/6) -> Res Publica (13/8); Strata (7/3); and Navigation (8/4). The first number in the parenthesis is paid by the [b]first[/b] player that develops it, the second, for everyone else after. Only the first to develop each tech gains a teach card (worth 1 point each). For a player to develop the connected tech (Commercium, Res Publica, Moneta), it must, first, develop the first tech. As, expected, each tech gives an advantage to the players that have them, like, Strata allows for troops to move up to two spaces instead of one; Moneta gives the player one extra resource when taking resources actions; Regnum gives +1 for defenses of cities; and so on.

- [b]Templum[/b] - the player can build Temples, paying 5 marble for each one, and it must be placed where the player has a city. A Temple gives the player several benefits: +2 resources of the type of the city it is in; +2 for defense of the city; permits putting up to three troops at once in the place when using the Militia action; and for every three Temples owned by the player, he gains 1 point. But Temples are also a target, as destroying them are worth 1 point.

The game goes between the player expanding (cities can be build, when doing other actions, if the player has an unit - ship or troop - in the region, and pays 1 marble, 1 gold and 1 iron for each city build) and doing actions in order to gain victory points. The things that give these points are:

- Every 5 cities controlled;
- Every 3 Temples controlled;
- Destrying one Temple;
- Being the first to develop a Technology;
- For every 7 regions a player has ships in (some regions count as two);
- If a player develops all the techs, at the highest level. Only one player can gain this point.

This it it. These are the things that need to be done in order to score. Each is worth 1 point, so, if you reach 10 cities controlled, you gain a card (for the 10th; you would already have one for the 5th when you did this), so, this is worth a total of 2 points (1 for the 5th, 1 for the 10th), and even if you lose cities, and went under 10, you keep the card. But reaching again 10 won't give points (you already have two cards), now only 15 cities will net you another point. The same is valid for every other point you gain - once you got it, it is yours, and can't be lost. I like this very much, since it pushes players to act bold, even when knowing you won't be able to actually sustain a position (for instance, invanding the land of someone else, in order to destroy a temple - your troops/ships maybe defeated easily later on, but if you conquered the city and destroyed the Temple, the point gained is already yours to keep).

[thing=166857][/thing] doesn't have the economic engine or timming that [thing=24181][/thing] has: there are no bonds to be bought, nor armies to keep paying for, lowering the net gain of money. Nor there is the possibility to act as another power, by claiming it to yourself. Even if there are lots of similarities in the actions, [thing=166857][/thing] is closer, in feel of the gameplay, to [thing=127023][/thing], as both had a feeling of development ([thing=127023][/thing] more for fight, but still), and the incentive to dare, to attack, as the points of winning battles can't be lost in [thing=127023][/thing].

However, it is important to say that combat isn't the only (nor, probably, the best) way to gain points. It is entirely possible to achieve the amount of points required by simply building (ships, temples and cities) and developing techs. For instance, in my first play, there was a grand total of [b]five[/b] combats (4 players), as fights are tough, due to the 1:1 basis, and the lost of units to conquer cities and destroy temples - it is not something easy to recover from (for both sides). Still, the games rewards boldness and I like this.

So, to finish, [thing=166857][/thing] is a fine game on its own, and is a sure bet for those that liked [thing=24181][/thing] but wants a shorter and lighter game, one that can be played well with four or five players. I enjoyed the game from start to finish, even if the first actions of everyone were pretty close to be all the same, but once everyone start to find their way around the board, [thing=166857][/thing] shined.

A vast improvement on the original, with a lot of small tweaks that balance the game a lot better. 

Extra defense for those with 0-3 VPs encourages exploration, neutral temples provide easier targets than bulked up nations, double-sea-spaces make navigation VPs more viable, and a more-or-less complete overhaul of military movement and building drastically simplifies what used to be the most awkward aspect of Gerdt's civ-builder.

This still tends toward the long side with many players, and as a race game can result in some less-than-dramatic finishes, but on the whole it remains a great piece of design I'm happy to own.

Is it possible to improve the best game around?
M.G. did it.
He took the best things in Antike and Antike Duellum, added a couple more ingredients and made it even better than before.
And while i was playing my very first Antike II game at PLAY 2015 in Modena, a man came to kindly put some order in our resources and coins. Only after a couple of minutes i realized he was MG himself!!

Well, I ACTUALLY bought the Antike i to ii upgrade kit which I guess amounts to the same thing. Only played new ver a couple of times so far but I think the few subtle changes ARE an improvement overall.
Update: Having played version 2 some more I am of the opinion that (for me anyway) version 1 is better. So I will see if anyone wants to buy the upgrade kit off me.

Gerdts says that he changed the city conquest rules to simplify the game but I think the original rules are more satisfying:

To kill enemy land/sea units just move units of the same type into the same region.
To conquer a city it's like you treat the city as a mini region within its region that you need to move into who's strength is calculated as 1 plus 3 for a temple plus tech defence bonuses plus a further 1 for each defending unit still in that region. This total has to be defeated in a one-er.
Thematically it's like all the defending units are garrisoned in the city for a siege. They strengthen the city against the siege and all die with the city if it falls.
I just prefer the feel of that.
I think maybe Gerdts is over-thinking a perfectly fine game that has become over-played and over-familiar to him so he's making change for changes' sake.

So next time I play I'm going to go back to version 1 which I am fully expecting to like better.

RATING: N/A
Fast-paced civ-light game about getting leader cards that give you VP. To get these cards you have specific objectives, such as a science discovery, or destroying a temple or having a number of cities.  The game play is on a rondel and turns are usually quite quick to resolve.  I liked the game, I thought it was enjoyable.

The mechanics are very simple but elegant (thanks to McGerds), and make this game a very beautiful strategic game to be played, easy also to be explained to new players and particularly-suitable to be used to introduce players to German games. It is for sure a game to be own in each player's collection.
Now come the knotty points: the board seems to have be designed with Word tools, the cards are anonymous even if representing historical personalities (why not using some pictures representing bas-reliefs or mosaics?) and finally the meeples are horrible in shape and colour (why not using some plastic soldiers?)! The global overlook is very poor and seems not to justify the price. Other historical games (e.g., Mare Nostrum Imperi) transmit a completely-different feel starting from the cover. There are lots of improvements to be implemented from this point of view. It is a really pity because the rating could have been surely higher looking only to the mechanics.
I hope that an "Antike III" will come and all the above-evidenced lackings will be overcome.

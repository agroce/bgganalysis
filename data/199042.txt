RATING: 6.5
Pro: Very good as an introduction to deck-builders.

Cons: Winning or losing seems to be determined by the starting villains due to the snowball nature of the mechanics. Games seem to drag on. I think removing the easy villains, and allowing players to mulligan the villains, would make the game work better.

Update: This did seem to make the game better, though it's still a little long.

Very surprised that this game is as good as it is. I would expect a cheap cash in, but no it is a really fun game. HOWEVER, the balance can be a bit off. Some games will be very easy and some very difficult. More often than not, the game will be balanced. 

A must have for fans of games and Harry Potter.

Decent deck builder but a bit too easy to win, especially at the lower levels.  I'm not a Harry Potter fan but my 9 year-old loves the series and this game.  Well constructed and attractive packaging.  Innovative decks organized by year.  One complaint is that it takes quite a while to clean up after the games and get the cards in their proper boxes.  This one introduced me to the deck-building genre but can take a long time to finish at the higher levels.

An enjoyable and fairly tense (in a good way) co-op deckbuilding game.

I'd play it again, but don't need to own it.


Liked:
* There are a lot of "global" effects (all players do "X") which helps 4-5 player games (and hurts...)
* The characters have "roles" that they are good at, but the variability of the market row means anyone can be anything

Disliked:
* Opportunities for actual interaction are limited, generally limited to "I give everyone [x] resource" or "I heal one person"
* Character roles get lost in the "buy the best thing available" shuffle, so our healer did damage, our other healer did damage, and our damage dealer let everyone draw cards instead
* With 4-5 players, there was a lot of opportunity to take a lot of damage before your turn came around again.  Downtime wasn't really an issue, but there were some unpreventable deaths/stuns early on

core mechanics not the greatest for deck-building - but the theme really hit the mark for us as fans of HP, and the extended range of leveling-difficulty really extended the usage and enjoyment by 7-fold

:thumbsup: Creating card combinations and defeating villains offer up a great deal of excitement and enjoyment.
:thumbsup: The build up from year to year adds on increasing difficulty that often scales well and slowly creates tension.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The heroes play slightly differently, yet in the end most feel rather similar.
[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]Most plays are either too easy or too difficult, with some balance concerns throughout.

:thumbsdown: The order of the villains is the most important factor in the outcome of a session, regardless of strategy.
:thumbsdown: The movie stills often depict characters with vacant expressions, which ends up detracting from the theme.

Purchased to play with my HP-obssesed son.

The games has great production values, but card stock is a bit flimsy.

The game is (at the moment) a bland Ascension-style deckbuilder, but since additional rules are unlocked with successive plays, can't comment on them at the moment.

For the moment the game is too easy and lacks tension, and surprisingly my son is not too interested. He cared a lot more about wining at Hanabi, which is a pure abstract!

Interesting deckbuilder, very cool to have new stuff added every year, and like that you can receive coins and attack out of turn, to be used on your next turn.  Still, once year 7 is done, there's less incentive to replay; if I feel like playing a deckbuilder, I'll go towards Aeon's End, Marvel Legendary or Clank!

RATING: 7
Kids aged 9 & 10 can play too! A nice family game, we made it through games 1 & 2 so far. It's not quite a deck builder in my terms because there isn's a limit on the number of cards, and so far there isn't a way to remove the weak cards.  The game progression is exciting!

Not rating because I only played the early games, which are easy and rather boring from a mechanical perspective. New players would expect to want to buy cards every turn but without a reliable way to thin your deck (in the first 2 games at least) you end up with huge decks that aren't very effective. I love the pseudo campaign, but unless this one gets better deeper in the box, it's kind of a pass, or reserved for drawing gaming muggles into the fold

Fun cooperative game. Ideal for 4 people to take on each role and help each other through each year. The years get progressively challenging and each person must build their decks to fit their strengths to help the group. Beware, no matter how you build your deck there is always an enemy who can make it your weakness.

This game is super dull. We gave up after a few games, it offers no real challenge or strategy. Play a card, do damage or heal - rinse and repeat.  As big Harry Potter fans we were disappointed - we won't be playing this again. Can't even see this holding the attention of new gamers. 2/10

players add more cards to their deck in the form of iconic characters, spells, and magical items. Other cards allow them to regain health or fight against villains, keeping them from gaining power. The villains set back players with their attacks and Dark Arts. Only by working together will players be able to defeat all of the villains, securing the castle from the forces of evil.

Completed without a loss.  Only lost a couple starting locations.  Seemed too easy, thought we were playing it wrong, checked the rules.... we were.... but playing with the correct rules only made it easier. 

Bought the expansion at the same time.  Played through the first two boxes experiencing the same as above and decided the game did not become harder... but only longer and more of the same.  Sold it and the expansion to recover some cost.  It is the only the second game we have sold off from our collection.

RATING: 6
Not terribly pleased with the component quality for this one--warped cards (and quite thin), board backing not glued down well. Even making allowances for living in Florida humidity, this seems a bit much!

Complaints aside, gameplay is solid. Years 1 & 2 are standard deck-builder fare, but thematic and enjoyable. Later years ramp up well--occasionally tough, but generally beatable. Additions each year are thematic and fun.

Wish there was a way to cull one's hand and/or thin out the draw deck. It's HUGE by game 4 (and just keeps growing), so that most lie buried and unused. There is no mechanism for clearing the cards "on offer" either, so if you're stuck with cards that are not useful, there's nothing you can do to mitigate it. Perhaps the expansion will deal with this.

Very good introductory co-op deck builder, though if you've experience with the style of game it won't feel terribly new. However, the components are nice, and I like the system they've used to introduce the mechanics to you through the different boxed games, like a representation of the novels or films. Once it's all opened, there is just more to the game, but you won't wanna throw that all at a younger player for whom this might serve as a gateway. Also the deeper in, the more spoilers if you are unfamiliar with the story.

RATING: 5
I like this game a lot with a bit of modification.  But as written, I could only give it a 5 star, because I think it is a little easy, barring certain particularly nasty villain combos -especially at the start of the game, which is the easiest way to lose.

My family, however, LOVES this game, and wants to play it over and over.  And I admit that it is an *extremely good game* for those people who are new to the deckbuilding genre, because the early games walk you through everything step by step.  This game is fantastic for people who don't play board games a whole lot because the first few books are quick and the game sort of has a way of teaching itself to you.  

So, if you're looking for a game to get your family into games, and especially if some of them are Harry Potter fans, this game is wonderful.   For me though, I'm looking for something a bit more advanced, and a bit more challenging.

A good coop deck builder.  Much better than most licensed games.  It comes with 7 games (representing the 7 books) and it scales well so Game 1 is great for really new players and Game 7 is going to be hard for experienced players.  You have to choose to pick cards that are really strong or weaker but help everyone.  Another great family game.

Initial Impression: I've finally found a gamer's game that my daughter wants to play. From when you first open the box to when you play your first session, this game will inundate you with all things Harry Potter. In particular, the spells, characters, and villains are all taken from the books and movies. My daughter waves her wand as she casts the spells described on the cards. As far as gameplay, this game is first presented as a very basic deckbuilder, which is perfect for my non-gamer daughter. As you progress through the game you will unlock extra content pseudo-legacy style in order to increase the difficulty, add to the story, and increase the complexity in increments. Personally, I find this delivery method brilliant as it won't overwhelm muggles who may be dipping their feet into designer boardgames for the first time. Looking forward to unlocking the next chapter of our adventures.

It's Harry Potter, no further questions needed on why I bought this. The excitement is palpable whenever it's time to open a new box to see all the new contents and rules to spice up the game. As stated in the rulebook, year 1 and 2 is expected to be easy and only for those not familiar with deck-building games so don't judge the gameplay till you reach later years.

I really love how the Hogwarts (ally, spells, items), location and villain cards matching the year they are introduced, very thematic. Fans of the series will be in joy when playing this game.

However, it's still a very light deck builder and subjected to luck, recommended only if you're new to deck builders or in love with Harry Potter.

If this was just a "generic" co-op deckbuilder it would no doubt be rated a bit lower but whatever. The same thing can be said for most Star Wars games. This game is fun! Components are pretty good. Using the Harry Potter theme, making each book a set of new components, and having this as a co-op game, I can see this as being a perfect deck-building gateway game.

RATING: 2
Played through the entire "campaign" with friends. It starts out as a super light deckbuider but never successfully builds to a rich, complex deckbuilder. Just turns into the same basic deckbuilder with more stuff to remember and keep track of. Devolves into a fiddly mess with enemy cards that present "false difficulty" (draw another bad card, lose health, discard useful cards, etc.) Turns into an overlong slog. Disappointing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is surprisingly good. The mechanics are sound -- similar to Legendary -- and very thematic. It has a poor-man's-legacy implementation, where you get 7 boxes that you open as you win games, each one adding some new mechanics and themed to the corresponding book. So like the books, they get more advanced as you go and you can always roll back to a lighter game.

The only problem I've had is variance. If the right (or wrong) card come out too early, you might have a tedious game where you know you'll win (or lose) but it takes an hour to finally do so. Nice game otherwise.

RATING: 9
We're always on the look out for great co-op games and are big Potterheads, so this was a bit of a must have game. My 8 year old son, wife and I played through the first 3 scenarios straight through on our first play. Found it particularly easy to pick up since we play the DC Deckbuilder a lot.

Really impressed with the quality of the components and board. Very solid and nicely printed. The weighty metal villain VP tokens are particularly fabulous. The imagery from the films is extremely well implemented, and we've had fun identifying exactly which bit of which movie some of the cards show. Its the first game I've sleeved.

Thematically I'd say this is strong. The individual character's starting decks and actions work well to make you feel like you're actually playing as one of the heroes, and encourage different play styles. We particularly enjoyed the way the episodes are individually packaged, meaning it's fun to see what's in each new box and acquiring new cards, with new powers, in game can be genuinely thrilling. Dobby turned up at just the right time to save our bacon today :)

The simplicity of the gameplay belies some pretty deep strategic choices and we genuinely needed to work as a team to beat the villains in the 3rd game.

I think the nature of a Deckbuilder means that this will have plenty of replayability too. Time will tell I suppose.

I don't recommend this game as the expansion pack contained many bent, warped and creased cards and the backs look a very different shade to my original game. Very disappointing. Raise your game!

RATING: 10
While the first couple of games are quite quick but really plain, the last couple of games are almost too long (2-3 hours with 2 players) but exciting. Essentially, I enjoyed the whole campaign more than just a single battle.

The difficulty is too dependent on the player number and the order of the villains. With 4 players, it seems impossible to win if Lucius is one of the first villains. Two-player games are quite easy; we played the whole campaign without losing but 4-player games are really tough.

The thing I dislike the most in this game is that after ten minutes, you can be pretty sure if you're going to win. If it starts with really nasty villains you're never going to make it and before you know it, you're in the last location. With a good start, you'll probably make it to the end in the first location.

This game does not add a lot new to the deckbuilding genre, other than perhaps the progression through "books" represented by boxes. That being said, it is very well put together and is a fun cooperative deckbuilder, espescially once you get to the later books and add to the complexity. The first book or two are really intended for people who have never played a deckbuilder in their lives, and do well to teach people how it works and what it's about. If you have played any deckbuilder at all, you should start with book 3 to have some challenge and some complexity. 

If you don't care for the harry potter theme, you may do better with another deckbuilder, but if you enjoy harry potter, I would definitely look into this one.

RATING: 9
At this moment the Harry Potter game is really hitting the deck-building idea and mixing it well with what feels like a story.  I legitimately care about the theme of the game whereas other deck-building games don't have the theme/story coming across in a meaningful way.  The game is missing two key points making it not quite hit the ten mark.  First: replayability.  The enemies become repetitive and you can find good ways to counter them after playing a number of times.  Second: Balance.  The way the enemies get shuffled makes a huge difference to the game, where most of the time we have had almost no difficulty whatsoever keeping the first location from being overtaken and then others where the first location is gone within a few turns and our decks aren't built enough to have a fighting chance.

Still, I would highly recommend this for playing through fully from beginning to end even if it may not last for 20+ games.

Played the full campaign with my wife using Hermione (her) and Ron (me).

Not once did we fail a year, though some years we were one or two dark marks from a loss, while others we never left the first location.

Each year adds elements to the game.  Sometimes it's more of the same.  Other times it's new components, tokens or card types.  As a Campaign leading you into the final year, it works well.  We might rewind everything to Year 1 just to try out Harry and Neville.  We're not sure yet.



THE FOLLOWING TEXT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.  NO ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO OBFUSCATE OR TALK AROUND ANYTHING FROM THIS POINT FORWARD.

STOP HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.



Each character has three cards in their 10 starting cards that influence how that deck should be played.  Further, each character (eventually) gets a special power that benefits the team overall and should influence which cards are chosen for purchase.

Hermione generates seals easily, between her special ability (play 4 spells to generate a sharable seal) and one of her starting items, which generates either 2 personal seals or 1 personal and one sharable. Finally Hermione's Time Turner allows her to place purchased spells on top of her deck for immediate access.  It was clear to use that Hermione was going to concentrate on spells, and she needed to make sure her deck didn't dilute too much with items or allies.

Ron's ability to heal a character of choice if he generates 3 or more "zots" makes him a minor healer and encourages him to stack attacks.  One of his items rewards applying the final zot with a seal (a minor advantage).  His other item causes each played ally to generate an extra zot, making Ron a logical candidate to collect allies, since that interacted well with his special ability.

Between Hermione collecting spells and Ron collecting Allies, the only items we really had to discuss were items, and those weren't difficult to divy up.  Ron needed extra cards, fast deck cycling and things that rewarded being discarded.  Healing items were pretty much evenly split and we're pretty certain that Neville would have favored items that heal had he been in the game.

My daughter recently started reading the Harry Potter series and this game has been a great motivator to continue reading - we get to play a new year once she's finished the corresponding book. The game is your standard deck-builder and starts off really easy and basic, but the difficulty definitely ramps up after year 3. A great introduction to deckbuilder games and a great theme.

This game is really well-designed. It's a co-operative  deck builder with legacy elements, but they make it simple enough to be a gateway-plus game.

When you get the game, the chits are already punched out - you just open up the game and basically start playing. It's a really easy experience, and relatively simple to start.

I don't know how easy to understand it is with a group of players new to the hobby, but one experienced gamer can easily teach a group of people how to play in a short amount of time.

The coins and lightning bolt tokens make things easy to keep track of - no mental math or calculations need to be done to figure out what card(s) you can afford on your turn.

RATING: 6
Played it at GenCon. Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle seems like a decently designed co-operative card game, following the archetype of the Legendary games. However, it felt like there was little progression over the course of a game. The game revolves around building up a powerful deck to defeat a set of villains. However as the game went on, the final fight with the Basilisk in the Hogwarts Dungeons felt no different than the initial tussle with Draco on the Hogwarts express. My deck didn't feel substantially more powerful and the villains didn't bring variety into the game. Overall, it seemed like a good way to introduce Harry Potter fans to board games, but seasoned co-operative card gamers may find it too simple.

Good introduction to deckbuilding for complete muggles, but that's where the appeal ends. Far too long (later games were well over 2 hours!) and too easy (we NEVER had to advance a location), at least at 2p. Also, the continued dilution of all decks leads to frustrating randomness and a weird ebb & flow of interesting cards.

Some theme-heavy games can get bogged down by the theme. This game is great with or without the Harry Potter parts. It plays much like other deck-building games. Hand limit of 5 cards, all to be discarded at the end of the round, with, of course, there being a few exceptions to the standard rules. If you remove the theme, the gameplay still holds up. 
If you are a Harry Potter fan, be aware this is 100% based on the movies and you will be seeing Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe, and Matthew Lewis from the first movie featured on the starting player cards, as well as other images from all 7 movies throughout. 
I would recommend this game and it could be a nice way to introduce new players to the deck-building style, with the cushion of a familiar and beloved movie.

[b]Barnes & Noble - Christmas 2016[/b]
I'm currently about half-way through the campaign.  It definitely starts out super easy, but has recently gotten a bit more difficult.  It's probably the best Harry Potter game out there.  A couple things I don't care for so much: (1) each book (or level) adds new bad buys to the mix.  Never do you take bad guys out, they just repeat year after year after year, adding more and more of them, making the game progressively longer too.  (2) It's great that you're adding new cards to the purchase deck with each book.  Only "bad" thing is if the market gets clogged with a bunch of expensive cards, it might be near impossible to buy a new card.  Also, your adding to your deck constantly, but there is no way to get rid of the basic starting cards.
...
I've since completed the game.  I was able to beat the game each time as two player.  From what I've read, it gets harder the more players you have.  But still, I enjoyed it and look forward to the expansion.  I definitely think the theme boosts my rating a bit for this game.

I very much enjoy this game. My wife and I play it as a two player most of the time, and every single time we have played this game, it has been a hit. The theme of the game is very profound throughout, and the rule changes as the game goes on are never overbearing.

The reason for an 8 instead of a 10 fall are twofold. One, it's a little too luck-based. If you draw a villain that is particularly harmful right of the bat, you're gonna have a bad time. 

Second reason is the start-over feeling as your progress through the years.  You are dealt 10 cards as your base deck and you start with those same 10 cards every single year. Your character do get an upgrade, but only in the third and seventh year. If we had one more in the fifth, I'd probably feel better about it, especially considering just how much happens to our heroes in the books.

All that being said, this game is wonderful. Every time I have played it, I have absolutely enjoyed myself. If you are a Harry Potter fan, this game is a must have for your collection.

Being a big Harry Potter fan I wanted to love this game.  But as deck-builders go it's not the most amazing game.  A fundamental deck-building mechanic is missing and that's the ability to remove the weaker starting cards from your hand.  I find that frustrating as the villains get tougher throughout the game.  Experienced, seasoned gamers may not find a whole lot to get their teeth into with this game.

However, the Harry Potter theme is rich and the attention to detail is very satisfying for HP geeks/fans. I do appreciate and enjoy that part of the game a lot.

Overall I think it's a reasonable gateway deck-building game made accessible with the HP theme.  Also I think older kids who are HP fans will enjoy this.  Although if you're not a HP fan then I'd recommend playing a different deck-builder instead.

This is surprisingly fun, but way too easy.  We've never come close to losing - indeed, we've only lost a location once (in our first game).  However, we still have a lot of fun playing, due to the theme and the gameplay.

It is nice to see so many familiar faces and places and items and spells appear.  There's also some nice thematic tie-ins, like how all the Quidditch cards work the same (and work together) or how Hermione gets bonuses for casting more spells (and certain cards enhance this), or how Expecto Patronum combos well with Harry, etc...

Gameplay-wise, as mentioned, the combos are cool.  It is fun to watch your character grow over the course of the game, and adopt a role (e.g. focus on spells, or allies, or damage).  Sometimes you see neat combos amongst the villains too.

However, again, it's too easy.  Buy the most expensive card, kill the strongest villains, and rarely lose.  We'll finish our plays through Game 7, and then pack this away for the kids.

EDIT: Ha ha, after getting crushed in Game 6, I may have to change my mind about the difficulty comments :)  We actually have to pay attention, and the difficulty seems like a good mix now.  Let's see how it holds up for Game 7...

EDIT 2: Ok, way too easy.  Finished Game 7 at the starting location.  Took two rounds of attacking to take out He Who Must Not Be Named.  

Super fun to play, zero challenge.  Game is held up by theme alone.  Looking forward to playing it again when my kids are of age, but wouldn't otherwise touch it again.

This is my most underrated game I've ever purchased.  I bought it because I thought it would be a cute deckbuilder with a fun theme that would be fun to play over Christmas that would probably be pretty mediocre.  It ended up being potentially the best gateway game of all time.

The combos aren't particularly intricate, and the amount of random chance is fairly high, I shouldn't really like this game as much as I do, but I'll be damned if it isn't a lot of fun.  It is much harder with four players, which is the best way to play it.

It could be improved dramatically if some cards allowed you to trash cards in your hand (a necessary mechanic for a deckbuilder in my opinion) but despite this it definitely excels at what this game is meant to do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a solid little cooperative deck building game. We are both Harry Potter fans so the theme is a big plus for us. There are a few small issues with this including the fact that the order in which villains come out can dramatically alter the difficulty of the game and you are not able to thin your deck back out after acquiring cards so sometimes buying new cards is a trickier decision than in other deck building games.

Decent deck builder. I'd recommend only playing this at level 5 and above to have a reasonable amount of challenge. Can be a bit lengthy though. Theme is more-or-less there.

Several of my friends and I have been slowly playing through this legacy game.  So far there has been no destruction of components so I really enjoy the game and how it works.

Fun cooperative game that captures the world of Harry Potter fairly well. I enjoy it quite a bit, despite not being a big Harry Potter fan. The Hogwarts cards are great, and it feels great to expand your deck as the game goes on. I like how the Spell cards show the proper wand movement, so you can get really geeky by acting out the spell if you want. It is also cool to be able to open the boxes as you progress in the game. Components are nice, including small metal Villain Control tokens. Definitely recommend (for Harry Potter fans, STRONGLY recommend).

RATING: 7
A very basic deck builder themed on Harry Potter's years at Hogwarts.  Mechanically (so far) it's very easy.  The game is broken into 7 "years", where defeating a year adds in more content to the game.  We're up to year 4, and the games are getting slightly longer due to the fact it keeps adding more villains to defeat without taking any out.  Interested to see how this ends up when all seven years are added in.

Probably the best gateway deck-builder there is.  It's one complexity step below other co-op deck-builders like Legendary or DC.  Kids and new gamers will catch on really fast.  Anyone who has played a deck-builder before will probably be disappointed by the boring cards, lack of a trash mechanic, and very limited deck-cycle.  And while the game does get more difficult with later books, the gameplay always stays the same.

I was in Tyche's Games (Athens, GA) when I happened across this game early in the summer of 2017.  I had played deck building games before (Star Realms, Dominion) but never a cooperative one.  I had played cooperative games before, like Pandemic, but thought that the cooperative nature of this game plus the Harry Potter theme would be a winning combination and I would be able to get my wife into the game.  I was right, and we have played through the whole game, using three characters.  My brother in law played the first year of this game with his 6 year old son.  But, later games add in new mechanics which would make it difficult for younger players to completely grasp.  There are proficiencies in the later games which can be changed to keep each game fresh allowing for further play.  Looking forward to the expansion to this game.

We are still playing through the earlier years, but the farther we get the more fun I have with it.  As a family we enjoy Harry Potter so this is a great game for us to play together.  My kids love all the cards with characters or items that they know from the books/movies.

RATING: 7
A really nice concept for introducing muggles (?) to deck building games - each book gets progressively harder and more complex. Up to the final book, and it's pretty meaty now - but heavily dependent on draw (with some coop deck builders that feels the case, but this is the one it's clearest in). If the wrong cards come up (or the right ones dont), it can be a slow death. However, some really nice mechanics overall and definitely enjoyed it all so far. And it's inspired my gf to play a game, and made a smart player of her.

Surprisingly good fun. Starts off fairly simple and easy, but the complexity and difficulty increases with each game completed (and thus the next game "unlocked"). Would probably work fairly well as a gateway game for deck-builder games.

RATING: 8
With the randomness of the villains coming out, can really ruin the game. Can become really easy to impossible to beat with a bad shuffle of the villains. Other then that the game is awesome! Friends that love HP also really enjoy the game. Must have if you really like HP.

Great mix of deck building, dice, and theme.  My daughter and wife are huge HP fans.  First 5 years went relatively smoothly, but game ramps up difficulty, especially with 3 or more players during later years.  Recommend Neville for his healing abilities.

RATING: 9
Fantastic building mechanics as the game progresses.  Asymmetric characters and starting decks really gives character to the game.   The difficulty ratchets up nicely.  Love the 'knocked out' mechanic, so you don't actually lose if your hearts hit zero, but the penalty is appropriate to make it strategic to avoid this.  

The only downside: you spend all the time to recruit cards to your deck, then start right over the next game, meaning the larger and more exciting cards are virtually useless. Lots of useless cards, no way of removing cards from your deck (I get that this is a complicated mechanic for a kids game, but it is central to deckbuilders). 
No one has ever been able to actually use Dumbledore in any of the games we have played so far. EDIT: We have now used Dumbledore, he is amazing.

Aaron owns this. A straightforward cooperative game with a great theme. I like how each of the characters has different paths to follow. We had a great game of Game 6 on 16/4/17 where we managed to use our abilities to the maximum, develop our decks, and then blast through the last few tougher villains. Game 7 was another matter and we struggled due to the buy market being overpriced at the beginning, though after a couple of plays we finally defeated Voldemort.

Was able to buy this at Gencon, but wasn't able to demo it first. So far I've beat the first 5 games and absolutely love it. Pretty standard deck builder with a great theme!
The components are very very good. The game is easy to learn, quick to setup, and very engaging. This will now be my gateway game of choice for introducing people to deck building games. I like how the "Books" work, adding new components, rules and difficulty. It feels like you are playing through the movies. Some have complained about the images coming from the movies, those people are wrong. The cards look great and are very quality. USAopoly has hit it out of the park and delivered a high quality, gateway game, that will have a good chance of introducing new people to our hobby.

Playing the game really feels like being in the movies or reading the books. I really enjoy being able to recruit all the different allies into my deck and being able to actually use all the unique items from the stories.
Card stock is not the greatest quality - which is a minor quibble as I will probably sleeve the Hogwarts cards in the near future - but still annoying for a game that is mostly cards.   
Great introduction to deck building games.  Year 1, 2 and even 3 seem like they may be redundant and never played again after the first play through, and the villain toughness is a bit uneven/inconsistent.  Had a good challenge in year 3, but then a very easy time with year 4, then back to a good challenge in year 5.  One other thematic quibble I have is that all the Weasley's produce money, which seems at odds with the family of characters actual financial state.

Just Ok. Very swingy for a co-op. Either way too easy or way too hard. Occasionally games can be tense, but those are the exception. Deeper issue with the game is that there are very few meaningful choices. Brain on autopilot, but you need to pay attention so you can trigger your abilities.

Just amazed at this as I was expecting worse or just for someone age 10-13. What we get instead is a solid cooperative deckbuilding game with a lot of theme in the same league as Dominion, Legendary & other deckbuilding games.

Each player's turn you draw dark art event cards & deal with those and the villain(s) effects on the players. Then the lead player spends cards for resources to attack the villain(s), heal, assist others, draw cards and/or buy cards.

The trick is keeping the villains from taking control of the locations as when they are all gone, the players lose. When a character loses all health they get stunned where they lose some stuff but will return next turn bruised but ready to keep going.

The books are all done like the expansions in A Touch of Evil/Eldritch Horror so since they are stamped on where they belong, you can easily reset the game or go back. The rules for the books past 1 state what special stuff goes in or books to add special tokens, cards, ect. 

Also in the rules are ways of going to more advanced play. Solo play is easy with just running 2+ characters too. If you like Harry Potter, it's a solid game to enjoy; if you like deckbuilding games, the game plus all the books as small expansions make it quite a good deal.

Yet another solid but uninspired deck builder. The game word is incredibly blah but the components are good and the card art (stock photos from the movies) is good quality. Cool that each game has a new box of cards for each book in the series. That give the game sort of a legacy feel but unfortunately this game is not a legacy game. Really feels like a missed opportunity.

First two games were pretty easy, and we had a very favorable setup for the third game. Games 4 & 5 have been difficult with 4 players, but not quite as bad with 2.

If you're a fan of the story you'll have fun with this. The game is decent enough, but it's the familiarity with the theme that really makes it work.

Solid with 2 players, Id imagine its better with 3-4.  If ur into HP, this game is awesome. Great artwork and tie into the original content. The first 2 books play really boringly. In fact idk y Dumbeldore is in book 1.

The only knock is that there are several late game rules ambiguities. Also if ur not careful about order of events and card text its easy to miss or forget an effect that may make it easier/or harder.

In the official USAopoly video there are rules stated that are completely different in the rules text. 

Theres a lot of content, a decent amount of variety. Solid gameplay makes this a good game.  If you like HP it makes it a great game.

It is NOT a legacy game, just to be clear. You could open all 7 books at once and start playing the "full" game... it's more of a programmed instruction game.
The gameplay is nothing fantastic... it's a middle-of-the-road deckbuilder, no major innovations. And actually it has less comboing than most deckbuilders.
But my wife LOVES Harry Potter, and she's so excited each time we play that I can't help but enjoy it.
Without her as a playing partner, the rating would drop to a 6 probably.

An interesting almost Legacy-light coop deck builder that just doesn't quite capture the theme of Harry Potter. It's also far too easy.

It has everything you need if you're a fan of Harry Potter and decking building games. I think the design of the game itself is one of the best I have ever seen when it comes to deck building. The rules are explained so there is no way for you to be confused. My wife and I learned it completely after one go. The progression is great and the game moves quick after you've mastered the basics. The price is great for how great the quality of the board and pieces are.

Maybe I'm partial to deckbuilders and Harry Potter. But this game is pretty damn fun. The girlfriend loves it because of the theme, and it is easy to get HP fans into the genre of game. Only issue I have is that there is no cull mechanic thus far (book 5) and it seems like at times the purchase deck gets too large.. i.e. only getting options of cards from book one.

We are fans of the Harry Potter universe, so this was a must have.  In reality, the theme is independent of the game, but doesn't seem plastered on.  We enjoy it well enough.  Unfortunately the game seems too easy, and gets incredibly long when you get into the later 'chapters'.

This is a terrific introduction to the deck building genre of board games and a great introduction to the hobby in general.  Any Harry Potter fan will delight in the imagery, references, and interactions of the cards.  The game has a lot of replayability due to it having the core basic game and then 6 additional add-in secretive boxes, (one per school year) which add to the lore, characters, and even game mechanics.  Best of all, it's great for teaching youngsters about the hobby because it is completely cooperative, so you can help your younger HP fans to play and learn the game.    Highly recommended!

RATING: 8.6
About 1-2x per week, my wife & I, who are both fans of the books, have been playing through this. The following is my running commentary; in parenthesis is the highly subjective difficulty level I'd rate it at.

Game 1: [2/10] fun for kids; quick, easy, good rulebook and intro to deck-building

Game 2: [2/10] same as Game 1; nothing new except cards; still too easy to make it fun for adults or especially for regular gamers

Game 3: [3/10] slightly more complex & longer length of play; still too easy; adds protective shields and individual player powers; a good starting place for adults OR a good place for kids to build up to

Game 4: [6/10] finally a decent co-op deck-builder with heft; adds a ton of new (and costly!) ally cards as well as Hogwarts dice (!!!); we lost the first 3 times, then won the 4th--and it felt very satisfying

Game 5: [6/10] this was easier for us than 4; we won the first try; it is the same except it adds new cards and Voldemort finally appears as a villain to defeat

Game 6: [7/10] was harder than 4 or 5, for sure, and MUCH longer (it took us 2+ hours to play each game). We lost the first two games and won the third. There's just a ton of villain cards to deal with, AND you have to resolve three Dark Arts events per turn in the final location.

Game 7: [7.5/10] we have played this twice so far, losing both games; however, they were both quite close--and the tension increased our love for this game! The Horcrux cards combined with Voldemort at the end make for a tough win. OK, so we just won it tonight (7/2/17); it took us nearly 3 hours to play. Feels good to be done, knowing that the Wizarding World is--while badly bruised--now in the healing hands of the new Minister, Kingsley Shacklebolt... :)

Husband recieved this from his 2016 BGG Secret Santa. There was much excitement when he unwrapped it!

Game play is very familiar for deck building and it reminds me quite a bit of Ascension, almost like it is a very thematic skin. This made jumping in very easy for us and the turns began to zip by quite quickly. Our first year wound up taking around 20 minutes, but don't let the first two years fool you. It's ramping up!

We finally stopped when Umbridge appeared and she was ultimately responsible for our demise. It felt right. It was also 2 am and we didn't realize how long we had been battling the forces of evil!

Harry Potter is a co-operative deck building game where players travel through seven different years following the story of Harry Potter. As deck building is concerned, this is very basic. The recommendation to skip to year three is a good one. However, the theme and simplicity places this game is a fantastic way to introduce others to the genre. I would like to try it again, playing a more difficult year, but the beginning has very little to offer.

IP-heavy games like this can either land in 'this would be abysmal if not for the theme' (Firefly) or 'this is a solid game design that is made that much better by the IP attached to it!' (BSG). This sits somewhere in the middle. It's a decent game design that is elevated by the IP but not so much that you wouldn't bother if it weren't Harry Potter. You do get a sense of advancement and (moderate) challenge from the game and the collective decision-making and progression of your characters is somewhat rewarding. I won't turn it down because it's a bad design but I also won't bring it up as something I'm itching to play, Harry Potter or not.

„Amikor megbékáztam Voldemort Nagyurat”
A pakliépítős játékok közel állnak a szívemhez, így mindig szívesen veszem az általam nem ismertek kipróbálását, sőt egyesek gyűjtését-birtoklását. A Harry Potter mozifilmek sorozata is kedvencem (az első 2 év kivételével), néha elképzelem, ahogy egy-egy varázslattal milyen szépen meg tudnék oldani problémákat (takarítás, közlekedés, …).
Ezen kis bevezető után nem is lehetett kérdés, hogy megszerzem és kipróbálom ezt a játékot is. Mivel Európában nem igazán elérhető, így nagy kihívás volt, de sikerült.
A doboz külsejében és belsejében is impozáns, remek, minőségi kivitel.
Maga a játék 7 éven keresztül kalauzolja el játékosait a már ismert kalandokon keresztül azokat kártyásított formában visszaadva. Természetesen célunk „Tudjukki” legyőzése csapatban, tehát a játék kooperatív. A játékban szereplő lapok pedig a mozifilmekből megismert képeket, jeleneteket tartalmazzák.
A saját szereplőnk (Harry, Ron, Hermione vagy Neville) kiválasztása után megkapjuk alap paklijukat (10 lapból 7 azonos, többi más-más), előkészítjük a játékterületet, felhúzunk 5 lapot a kezünkbe és már indulhat is a csata. Először a sötét oldal jön, majd kis csapatunk egyik tagja.
Körünkben alapvetően pénzt termelünk, hogy jobb/erősebb lapokat szerezhessünk meg és ütjük a gonoszokat alap paklinkkal kevésbé, majd egyre hatékonyabban és gyógyulunk „ezerrel”.
Az adott év sikeres teljesítése után újabb dobozka vár ránk, amellyel újabb lapok, így szereplők, varázslatok, tárgyak, egyben új helyszínek, ellenségek, sötét varázslatok kerülnek játékba.
A játék szabályai egyszerűek, kimondottan családi játéknak érzem az egész gém kialakítását, játékmenetét, amelynek fő célja bemutatni a pakliépítést és szórakoztatni a korban kisebb generációt.
Ezen céloknak tökéletesen megfelel, bár angol nyelvfüggősége és nehéz beszerezhetősége miatt kis hazánkban nem sok embert fog elérni.
Azon játékosok részére, akik már tapasztaltabbak a pakliépítés terén és/vagy a Harry Potter univerzum nem vonzza őket, erősen megfontolandó a játék birtoklása. Sajnos a játék előkészítése során az aktuális gonosztevők megjelenésekor már megjósolható a küldetés sikere vagy bukása. Nem igazán éreztem nagy kombinálási lehetőséget a lapokkal, sem egymás segítésének lehetőségét, amikor nem az én köröm van. Köbö felhasználom a lapjaimat, megveszem, amit tudok és kész, várom a következő kört. Azonban azon lapok megjelenése, amelyek eldobásukkor is adnak valamit kifejezetten tetszett.
Azért annyit megjegyeznék, hogy nem sok olyan játékról tudok, ahol egy békával meg tudom ölni a Sötét nagyurat. :)

As mechanics go, this game is a standard deckbuilder with nothing too special. However, how they integrated Harry Potter into it was fantastic. We loved opening up a box for each book and doing kooky things as our characters. If you're a Harry Potter fan that likes deckbuilders, this is a no brainer. It's also the best introduction to deckbuilding we've seen.

This is a provisional rating since we haven't played all the levels yet.  But this is a very fine game--it's a good take on cooperative deck building (it's truly cooperative, unlike Legendary) and does a great job of bring in the theme.  They had fun making this and we have fun playing it.  Recommended.

Received this game as a gift from my wife as a birthday gift.  We had tried a friends copy out one time and enjoyed the game.  The game has a money economy, an enemy hit economy, and a health economy that has to be worked out and balanced.  Also, each module to the game seems to add a new element.  The coop aspect removes victory point collecting and decisions are more of will this card be good for accomplishment or do I need something to keep my character alive.

I enjoy this game  even more than I expected! Opening boxes was awesome, but I look forward to resetting and teaching it from the start to some new muggles :) Looks this might be the perfect gateway deck-builder. 

I enjoyed all the new things later boxes introduced and the full game, full experience is really challenging and rewarding. Plays quickly with 2. Great replayability because of different starting powers & order the villains and Hogwarts cards come in. 

I have the expansion, too and will definitely check it.

Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle is a scaled cooperative deckbuilder, with a series of themed cards and rules that add to each game, following the plot of the Harry Potter movies, and featuring art/characters from the movies.

At the bottom level it is quite easy- but this is intentional to help draw beginners into the game, and help them gain confidence and experience with the deckbuilding system.

It plays at least as well as Thunderstone, in terms of themed deckbuilders- though with the drawback that being themed there is an end to the story, and less flexibility in terms of the enemies faced than that example.

The one criticism I have read- and would agree with so far- is the lack of deck-thinning cards to help to hone a better deck.

Nevertheless, for HP fans, and for their families this seems a fun enough deckbuilder, and likely will be enjoyable enough to play several times in the future.

A gateway deck-builder that eases players into the mechanisms before ratcheting up the difficulty in each successive 'book,' resulting in some epic games.

Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle has a clean, albeit spartan, aesthetic. Its components get the job done. Regardless of glitz and chrome, the theme will likely hook gamers and non-gamers.

I do worry that the ever-increasing length is a detriment for some of the game's demographic.

All in all, the makers created more than a good licensed game; they created a good game, full stop.

Not a huge fan of coops, but the theme makes this game fun.  Game 5 was the first time we actually came close to losing.  We lost game 6 once and won game 7 easily.  The game is too easy if you can choose the characters and proficiencies.  I suggest dealing two to each player and choosing from those.  This game would be rated higher if it was balanced better.  It's longer than it needs to be in the later games.  It's really easy to win by stalling on easy villians but that causes the game to drag.  Replayability is not great after game 7 but the expansion breathes new life into it.

I love Harry Potter and received this as a gift. It starts off super simple, and doesn't really start to feel difficult until game 5 or 6. It's a fairly straightforward deckbuilding game and doesn't really offer a lot of depth. The decisions are usually fairly obvious. It is enjoyable though, and I have fun while playing it. I'm not usually a fan of screenshots as artwork, but I didn't mind them in this one. I liked the fact that when you recruit an ally or a special item such as the Marauder's Map, you are the only one who has that ally or item because there is only one copy of it in the deck. A small detail but something that has bothered me in other games. I like the game, but after I finish game 7 I'm not sure how often I'll break this out. Probably when I need a Harry Potter fix. :) A keeper because Harry Potter. :)

It's fine. I don't find it incredibly compelling, but it's not bad either. Around and around you go, doing the same things in a different order. The coolest thing about it is how it's broken up into "books", so each successive mission is harder than the last, but the gameplay itself got tiresome after awhile.

Best coop deck builder. The first 3 games are a bit too easy (it`s perfect to teach the game to a newbie) but after the 4th box everything just gets more serious and hard, more villains, more dark arts cards etc. you can lose 6 health in a second. Really fun game, I adore the theme, it`s just fits very well. 

IMPORTANT: Use the offical rule variant where every player could once in the game discard all Hogwarts cards and draw six new one. This is not in the rulebook, but it`s an additional offical rule to evade situations where the six cards at Hogwarts are too expensieve to buy or cards that nobody wants to buy just to fill their hands unnecessarily, so if it`s nothing cool on the "market" or everything is too expensive just skip a buying phase and discard all six cards to get new ones.

I really loved how this games grows after each battle.  I played many deck builders but the additional years (game packs) that you unlock really make this game fun.

I would of gave it a 10 but I am not sure that after all 7 years are defeated how much replay ability it will have with the same people.

EDIT - Beat the game and nope no more replayability....  lowered my review to a 5 because of it.

If you are just starting to play, hold your judgement until you get to at least Game 4. The first game I hated it, but I knew the other boxes would add to it, second game was a bit better but I still won it without batting an eye, third was much better, but more challenging, but still won it without to much difficulty, but the 4th one there wasn't even a hit that I was going to win.

Played this as a family and have it enjoyed it greatly as a co-op.

Being able to set it to whichever Game you like as well is very nice.

My introduction to deck building that allowed me to understand what the draw was - I hadn't felt it with Dominion, interestingly. The co-operative nature has also been a draw, allowing me to play with my 7 year old daughter. The theme was also very clever, with different spells, items or allies allowing different powers, and different enemies/Dark Powers having different effects upon the players.

After (2) games: Has some flaws (player balance, fewer players makes the game easier - no way to clear the market - some timeline issues for those that are picky about), but a deeply enjoyable experience with fans of the series. Put on the soundtracks and you feel like you're slinging spells.

This is my favorite game to play with my 3 oldest kids (ages 9, 10, 12).  It fits the theme of Harry Potter perfectly, and the way the game is split up into campaigns makes it hard to stop when you want to see what powers and villains are coming up next. The balance is perfect where we lose sometimes, but not usually. A big THANK YOU to USAopoly for putting so much thought and effort into a game that could have just been a quick merchandising money grab.  10/10.

A pretty basic cooperative deck building game.  

The key twist is that many of the cards help your team mates out.  (and some of the villain effects affect all players.)  This keeps you involved even when it's not your turn.

So far, after 4 plays, it's been too easy.

Neville healing everyone right before Ron chooses to stun Neville, instead of Harry, so that Harry can take out Lucius Malfoy next turn. FUN.

RATING: 6.3
We had a good time playing up through each of the years but will probably not play again.  The deck-building where you get progressively more awesome by buying items and recruiting allies that you remember from the books and movies is fun.

We generally want to stick to the official rules in working through a cooperative game with different levels, so we confront the challenges as the designer intended.  There are some real downsides to doing that in this game, and many of the house rules recommended in forums in this site probably would have improved our experience.  The big issue is balance.  In all the games we played, we were either clear from maybe ten minutes in the game that we were going to win so long as we stuck to our plan, or we were so overwhelmed it was clear we were going to be lost before we managed to get our decks strengthened.  Part of this is that the game scales poorly, so something that is relatively easy with two people will feel plausibly impossible with four.  Some fixes for these have been suggested on this site and, as I said, they are probably for the best.

Very fun to pass the time and with the right group. Unfortunately, success depends heavily on the randomness of the villain deck and the cards that come up for purchase. Our group has had total wipes when playing to the best of our abilities, and had total cake-walks on the same "Year". Both outcomes are fun, but it doesn't feel like our skill had anything to do with success or failure.

After a slow start, the game picked up a bit of momentum. Still, five games in it feels repetitive and there isn’t enough fun to keep me enthused for the hour+ it takes to get through a round. The production is rather drab- a surprising disappointment given the vivid qualities of the source material. I think it telling that the game also failed to fascinate my ten year old daughter (for whom it was purchased). That said, if you treasure the Potter franchise there is probably a lot in this game for you and your family/friends to discover and enjoy. If you just love deck builders, you'll fare much better with other titles.

father's day 2017. Played levels 1/2/3 solo, not very impressed yet. Based on Tom Vasel's review, I'm considering opening all the packs and playing the next game in full, but it may be better to teach Ashley in segments. TBD.

Update: played 2 games with ashley, lvl3 and lvl4. we won round 3 and lost on round 4. we added a house-rule mid game "pay $1 to clear a card from hogwarts tableau" because we had a bunch of super expensive cards. I read forums after playing and noticed that there is a "clear all cards once per game for free" official rule addition, that still seems weak. 

The level 4 game seemed VERY difficult and was pretty discouraging. It may have been that we ran into the more difficult villains to begin with and lost the first location too quickly, which is what I've read is the easiest way to lose. I think now that we've got a better handle on the game, we can play again with a more focus on building up each character's  best abilities. 

I do very much like the theme, though I would have preferred that they use the unique artwork (aka - not the movie licensed stuff)... 

Another Update (2018) Played a few solo games at level 7 and enjoyed it quite a bit. I didnt finish either game (it's long!), but it was much more engaging with the additional rules and villains.

Very fun game and easy to pick up. It took all of ten minutes to learn the basic rules of this game. Very fun and absolutely flawless in the execution. Games or "years" match up with the movies and contain 7 total years. Each year adds new rules and increased challenge to the game. Very well thought out even down to the solution to "saving" your game if you don't complete all 7 years in one sitting. This game would be easy enough for most kids ages 8 and up to pick up on making it fun for the whole family. I highly recommend.

Fun deck-builder but I would place it just under the Legendary system if you are on the fence with Marvel vs Harry Potter themes.

An excellent "Legacy Light" game that does a great job at introducing new rules, components, and game play.  However, this is all marred by truly cheap card-printing (little or no finish meaning that they get noticeably damaged/scratched at the slightest stress, and color variations that should not exist in a single printing) and terrible balancing of later years (games can be super easy, or next to impossible based on initial setup and the market deck shuffle).

I'm usually more inclined to go easy on problems like these if they're minor, but in this case, they're severe, and I deducted a full point each from what should have been a solid 8.5.

This is absolutely the Harry Potter game to own!  There is no better game based on the franchise.  It's well balanced and well rounded.  Turns don't take too long and the fact that it is split up into 7 books gives it replay value.  You will like this even if you're not a Potter fan.  If you are a Potter fan, why don't you already own this?

Hearing really good things about this game. My wife really enjoys Legendary, so a Harry Potter Deck Building Game is a no-brainer for us.

Update Dec 28/16: 4 games in we're really enjoying this game. Slow start in the first 2 games, but we resisted skipping to Game 3 right away to preserve the movie storyline. So far I don't see as much replayability as Legendary, but the theme is a favorite so it will definitely get a lot of 2 player plays with my wife and will probably hit the table with family.

Very basic, but extremely solid co-op deck builder. Well themed, well designed, simple but rock solid mechanics, top notch components with a literally perfect box insert. The lightness of the game might turn some off, but this is fantastic for a gateway game,  game for children, non-gamers who might love the theme or a hardcore gamer looking for a lighter experience with a faux-legacy style (the game advances with each play-through, but nothing is kept between plays). The difficuly ramps up with each playthrough, but remains manageable, experienced gamers will find little challenge until the final games. Highly reccomended.

I picked this up to play with my girlfriend as she is a tremendous fan of Harry Potter.  I'm not a particular fan of Harry Potter but I do enjoy the game on mechanics.  My GF who does love the theme absolutely loves the game.

It's a good co-op deck builder that lets you formulate strategies.  In the later books where you get multiple enemies at the same time it can carry an interesting tempo where certain combinations will be a pita to defeat and then you may get a temporary reprieve for a turn or two depending on who is on the board.  This can lead to the main negative below.  

My main main negative that i've come across is below:: (note this is with 2p, haven't played with more)
Without trying to spoil anything, as you get into later books you deal with more enemies on the board initially, there can be a high roll potential to draw multiple foes initially that will either cause you to reset the villains or you can lose quickly do to the fact that you need a few rounds to build up a deck that can handle some of the more difficult enemies, especially if you draw certain combinations.  This can quickly be resolved though if you've played through the books and it only takes a minute to reshuffle and redraw.

Overall I enjoy this game, and look forward to completing through book 7 and then moving onto the expansion.  It almost makes me want to actually go watch the movies lol

edit:: finished book 7 with GF in 2 player games, and it is enjoyable that there are progressively more mechanisms added through-out the books, the negative still holds.  Initial villain and item draw can vary the difficulty wildly.

This game is just amazing. Theme is very well integrated and is especially fun if you allready enjoy the Harry Potter world. Cooperation is crucial to win and the semi campaign aspect of it is really fun and keeps you wanting to play another round to be able to open the next box. Ive seen a lot of reviewers say you can just jump into everything at once but that would really diminish the gameplay. Highly recommend this one.

RATING: 6.2
Played year 1 and then year 3.

Fine gateway deck-builder for casuals new to the genre, but not very innovative to a very saturated genre. Much of the card art is lazy and incongruous with the movie screenshots. It's a false co-op game - meaning, it is truly a single player solitaire game with multiple people taking turns playing 'together'. There is no hidden information, traitor mechanic, or competition, so the game suffers from the same problem as other false co-op games (i.e. Pandemic) - Quarterbacking.

If you're an experienced deck-builder gamer, this one can be skipped. Even as an HP fanatic, this game doesn't offer enough for me to want to pick it up.

****SPOILERS****

This game is pretty cool and easy to get into for new players to the board game hobby.  This is a fairly simple deck-building game.  I enjoyed playing it through all the way, but could have used some more interesting concepts in the game.

The game felt too repetitive, doing the same thing each game, just making its more difficult (longer) each game.  I probably wouldn't recommend getting this game if you have played other deck-building games, like Legendary.  But the suspense of opening each box is a lot of fun.

I love everything Harry Potter, so this was a no-brainer purchase. I am little over the deckbuilding genre, especially games that use the same dominion or ascension models and don't do anything different. While this game fits into the latter mold of deckbuilders with the Harry Potter theme it was pretty enjoyable to me. Not sure this will be the case for everyone who gets the game, but it was for me. The game really ramps up in difficulty as you start getting into the later years, and the last battle against Voldermort is epic. The strategy for the game is pretty straight forward, make sure you never leave the first location. Once you do leave the first location everything goes downhill really quickly.

Impressions from first 3 years WARNING SPOILERS: I know this game is supposed to ramp up more later with more conplexity, but I kept feeling like they need to hurry it up. Comboes are fairly obvious and most cards are really basic +1 or 2 attack, money, heal, etc. There are some great ideas, namely the different starting decks, the persisting effects of the villains, and in year 3 character abiliies, but for the most part they still feel like not enough differentiation because often they do similar or very vanilla things.

This game seems to have a pretty big snowballing issue. Later locations seem to be generally worse in terms of more dark arts, but if you can get your deck clicking you can eventually heal as fast as you are taking damage and remove markers from the location timer as fast as they are placed.

A big concern I have with this game is even if the more complicated later years add more interesting cards if the early year hogwarts cards are not removed in later games they would exacerbate the issue already present in years 2 and 3 where the buy row is clogged with things no one wants.

Games got progressively longer as you had to defeat more and more villains to succeed. The first game probabl took less than 30 minutes but the 3rd probably over twice as long.

Fantastic game! Being big HP fans and loving co-op games this was an instant hit with us and one that sees a lot of table time. Excellent co-op game our whole family enjoys, narrowly beats the top spot over Pandemic for us because of the theme, but it's very close! Will always keep this one!

Legacy-ish deckbuilder (although you can undo all "legacy" elements by simply re-boxing the relevant components).  Despite its completely simple and done gameplay, this title works because of how well it evokes its source materials and how naturally the legacy elements work.  The first three boxes are fairly straightforward, much like the first three books.  The fourth game suddenly becomes a much longer affair, much like the fourth book.  The fifth and sixth games then become much more difficult and lethal... you see where I'm going here.

Decisions are very banal. 
It "plays itself" for the most part and scales horribly (since it lasts about the same number of total turns and thus with more players your deck does not get to "improve" enough).

Harry Potter Deck Builder. Absolutely FANTASTIC production quality. The game flows amazing and the rule book is a true hand-holding tutorial (through game 1) with pictures of the board. Game gets stupid hard too. Only gripe and why it's not a solid 9.5 or 10 is the use of movie photos rather than art. Otherwise one of the best co-op deck building games out there!

We are huge Harry Potter fans. We met at an HP convention, got engaged in front of Hogwarts at Universal Florida, and even did our sons nursery theme in HP. This game just hits such a sweet spot for us. It is only my second deck building game (Paperback being my first) and I really like this style of game. Will definitely want to try more deck builders in the future. I love the cooperative nature of this game and the way new stuff is revealed with each year. The cards abilities all fit so well with the theme too. I think we will play this for years to come.

This was a nice enough game. We liked it, but once we'd played through the seven "books" we didn't feel the desire to keep it. It was a bit too long for what it was once you got to the later games, and it could be very swingy depending on the random flop of the villains. There didn't seem to be any way to reliably adjust the difficulty.

With licensed games, the first thing I look for is a company other than Cryptozoic on the box. Not Cryptozoic? Maybe worth a shot. This one is better than worth a shot -- it's surprisingly good throughout, and avoids a lot of the potential pitfalls of licensed games. Hell, they've even managed to combine good use of movie images with clear, effective card iconography.

Based on playing years 1-3, I like it. I don't love it; it's a better co-op than it is a deckbuilder. I suspect that there's more interesting deckbuilding elements in the later years.

I like the way it builds up from the very basics to more complex scenarios. My group of four never felt even slight pressure in the first three years, but an unlucky pair of villains coupled with a few bad dark arts cards could have put on at least a bit. But we also never steamrolled anything -- and I think the game is deliberately gradual in its pacing, to accommodate a wider audience.

I love that the characters develop specializations, but that you also get room to customize your deck (ideally in ways that complement your specialization, of course). And on top of a solid engine and well-implemented co-op play, they've managed to layer an experience that feels satisfyingly like playing the main cast at Hogwarts in a lot of ways.

That's no mean feat! Lots of needles to thread, and thus far I like how they got threaded. I look forward to seeing the later years.

Pretty cool  coop deckbuilder in the same vein as Legendary. I don't care much for the Harry Potter theme, but my kids do, and that's what's important. The twist to this game is that you have 7 progressive scenarios that you play. Each scenario adds a few more rules to the game. The bosses become more challenging, but the card pool gains in strength as well. If you're into coop deckbuilding and/or Harry Potter, this is sure to be a winner.

Expelliarmus! let's be honest, this one is all about the theme here. It breathes new life into an old boring deckbuilding mechanic. There isn't a culling mechanic where you can discard starter cards though. But it gets by just fine without it. This is a true co-op, and the game starts to ramp up in difficulty with the inclusion of decks 4 and 5. Rules suggest experienced players to to skip to book 3 i believe, but i started with 1 and worked up from there. Skipping ahead provides a better gameplay if you're only gonna play the game once. But as a fanboy, i started from the beginning to get the full thematic experience of graduating and going to the next year. This is probably my favorite co-op, and it's good thematic fun, but it's still just a deckbuilder, so don't expect too much depth in strategy.

Played once using friend's copy. This is clearly aimed at fans, and deckbuilding element is not as strong as it could have been.

Edit:

Finished Game 7 last night. The introduced elements at Game 6 and 7 brings a bit more variety to the game. We had a very easy time with the Malfoy family all out as villains, allowing us to prepare our deck fully before going onward. 
All in all not a bad game, but game length is slightly too long (you have to defeat previous villains), and is quite RNG-based.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I was pleasantly surprised by the effort put into this game. While there are a few frustrating flaws, for the most part this is a solid riff on the "Legendary Encounters" or "Ascension" formats.

The biggest drawbacks to this game are the complete lack of methods to "clean" your deck of inefficient cards or manipulate the card marketplace. These features are crucial to deck building games and their absence in this project is greatly felt for all of the wrong reasons. They are, however, easy enough to house rule around to get this game into something more playable.

If you have Harry Potter fans in your circle of family and friends, this is definitely a solid buy. If you already own Dominion, Legendary, or Ascension, this might not be worth adding to your library.

We love the films, so this is fun to play.  Not challenging or very thinky at all, good for a time kill.  Games get longer as you progress (early games about 30 minutes, then mid games 60-90, last games about 2hrs each).  We will finish the last game, until we beat it.  If it just takes one try, we'll retry it on the hardest level, and then maybe a couple of quick plays to get a spot in my 10x10.  After that, probably won't play it too often.  But that would be 10 plays, with a total of 12 or so hours of play, so we'd have our money's worth at that point.

Very light in the first three games, but then evolves into a tense crazy battle against the forces of evil! This is absolutely amazing as a gateway game for HP fans. The enemies feel very threatening, and the relief to finally be able to add an amazing card to your deck is absolutely statisfying! Haven't played through all Games through, but as of now, it feels quite hard to get powerful cards, so improving your money engine is imperative.

Great deckbuilder with excellent Harry Potter theme. The deck building is pretty generic and has the same "easier with less players" flaw, but as this is designed to be easy and aimed towards Harry Potter fans (most probably non-boardgamers), I say the game is right where it needs to be.

The amount of fun we are having while playing this game is almost ridiculous! My husband and I are both Harry Potter lovers and to us, it feels like the game designers of Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle are, too. The theme is very nicely implemented and much thought was put into every detail.  
The game play mechanics are well-thought-out; The game is fun even if it's fairly easy to beat with two players (we haven't tried increasing difficulty yet). With four players it's quite challenging, but even when losing a couple of times we are still always encouraged to play another round. 
This is a definite recommendation for any boardgame-loving harrry potter fan :)

Have played the first three years with the family, and it has gone over well.  Both of them are big Harry Potter fans, and so know all the references.  It is well done, with slowly increasing difficulty, and has taught them both how deckbuilders work.  Playtime is being expanded, and I hope not too much more.  I am looking forward what happens next, much more than I did forPandemic Legacy, for example.

Jan '16:  Son is hooked, and wife gets very distraught if we run into troubles.  Smooth sailing until we stumbled on game 4 when we started with Lucius Malfoy and Pettigrew: this combo when we were trying to build our decks was simply too much to overcome and we were totally wiped out, running to the third encounter location before we even could do any damage.  An immediate replay and we won handily, so the first two baddies you face can really chnage the tone!

May '17: buzzed alomg with bump in game six, but seven is a killer so far.  And the initial three baddies seem to have the most impact as to where the game will go.  The Horcruxes are really, really bad for us.  It may take some time to beat the seventh level.

July '17:  Finally won the full game.  It really comes down to the initial baddy distribution.  A couple are well-neigh impossible, so we allow ourselves a mulligan when we see a couple of them paired in round 1.

It's cute and fun to play if you're a HP fan.  But the mechanics are clumsy and unnecessary (why buy tokens to spend?  why not simply use the cards as currency?).  Still its a fun way to play as your favourite characters and battle evil!  Too bad it can't be played the other way round!

This cooperative deck builder gradually gets more difficult as the games progress and different rules & mechanics change the games.
If you enjoy the Harry Potter theme then this game works even better and you can throw yourself into the spell casting by waving imaginary wands!

Probably the number one best game for teaching new players how to play a deck-builder. It's not super simple to roll-back the game to the starter set for teaching, but in the end it becomes a good deck-building game and brings people in on the more difficult concepts gradually.

We've only played game 1, and cant wait to play the rest.  I've (mistakenly on purpose) peeked into future boxes (I have read all the books) so I know it gets much more complicated.  Can't wait for my son to get through the next book so we can play.  I dont k ow we can wait that long!!

Oh, and the nerd in me squees that the game board is the folded Mauraders Map!

Thank you! Thank you! USAopoly.  Just played first year once, this is a pretty standard deck builder with a  GREAT theme wrapped around it.  But the most important thing for me is that I was able to play it with my teenage son & daughter in under an hour (with rules explanation) and it held their interest.  I'm very appreciative of being able to spend some time with them on a co-op game (something we can enjoy together) and drag them out of their rooms and away from their damn digital devices.  Much appreciated!

After having finished the game, I can now offer up a rating that reflects my thoughts on the game as a whole. I feel like this game is at its best around years 3 and 4. The early years are too simple, and after awhile the amount of villains and Dark Arts cards makes the game a bit long and fiddly for what it is. Not to mention incredibly swingy. A certain combination of villains can pretty much doom you to failure from the start. I almost wonder if it would be easier to stack the decks so the villains and Hogwarts Cards come out in order. Still, I like the progression from one game to the next. Years 4, 6, and 7 add in some pretty cool layers to the system. The game does end up being a little longer and random than I was hoping it would ultimately be, but I think some slight house rule tweaks could make this an excellent game. There's a lot to like here, and while I think I may prefer Hogwarts: House Cup Challenge a bit more in comparison, this game does a great job at covering the entirety of the Harry Potter saga.

Arc is always: you take a beating and lose first, then the tide turns in the third and they don't stand a chance. Except if you get enough "remove skulls" early on, you don't even lose the first location. Too easy, but we still enjoy it. 
Update: Lost our first Game 6, badly. So it's possible, great! 
Bad 3-5 first Villains and no "remove skulls" cards = loss. Otherwise win.
Update: First G7 a very tight and exciting win.

RATING: 4
I have wanted to like this game so much. But its power curves are fundamentally broken. Way too few meaningful decisions and winning or losing depends on random setup draws rather than strategy. It is impossible to lose games 1-5 if you try and game 6/7 is either equally easy and meaningless or kills you within the first 10 min without any chance. Interesting challenges exist only by chance. Without the emotional sunken cost fallacy (my gf loves the HP theme), I'd rate this a 3.

Edit: Apparently there are ways to turn this into a decent game by houseruling some things. Not ideal, but will try again.

So far, this game has commanded 3 full game dates.  Still stuck on game 4.  It is always different, as a deck builder you may find that you have numerous of the same cards each time, but there is always something more.  It's challenging, but so far it's not been so infuriating, to not warrant another try, when the game wins.  Very co-operative.  I suggest buying it, and continuing to play ad nauseum.

Deck building is probably my favorite mechanic and I love the campaign this game includes adding something new for each game! However, the game ends up being the same each new year, except a little longer. I don't see us pulling it out much after we finish the campaign.

I haven't played through all of the "books" yet, but I've really enjoyed it thus far.  It's fun to open up a new box each time and see the game grow.  It definitely works best for Harry Potter fans, and people really get excited to see new characters and items from the movie appear.  It's not the hardest co-op game out there, but it does offer some fun, deck-building game play.  

It has so many cards that you won't see everything in one play-through.   When you add that to the different "books," the game has some fun replay value for fans of the theme.

In a nice routine with my 9-year-old where we read the book together, watch the movie, and then play the relevant book.  We're through Book 4 now and the game is really picking-up - lots of fun opening the latest sealed deck and seeing what's inside.  Memories being made!

RATING: 10
Sure.... this is themed....  You either need to like Harry Potter or at the very least have seen the films or read the books.... 

SOOOOO many good things about this game...

Co-op!!!!!  You can play by yourself or with up to 3 other players.  And you don't fight with each other or try to beat each other. you defeat Voldemort or die together....

HP Books 1 - 7.   The game starts at book 1.  You have specific cards available to you and villains, etc, that are associated with book 1.  When you defeat that "game", you can either move on to book 2 or add book 2 into book 1 and play the game all over again!!!!  It's "sort of" like a Legacy game....  But you can re-shuffle all cards back into their original boxes.  

Adults and kids (10+) will really have a fun time working together to defeat the bad guys....

If you're looking for a light/medium deck building game - this is it.  Rules are easy to figure out and play is VERY structured....  Check the location.  Do what it says.  Reveal dark arts cards.  Resolve villain abilities.  Play your cards to buy new cards to add to your deck or fight the bad guys.

10/10 in my book.......

Picked up this game last November and we've slowly made our way through the various years. We're a pretty advanced gaming group - usually playing on the hardest difficulties on most co-op games.

RATING: 6.8
While keeping this spoiler-free, ultimately a little disappointing due to the game not evolving sufficiently into a 'proper' deckbuilder. Successive plays just don't feel different enough to really make you want to do the campaign more than once, and as a deckbuilder it never once progresses beyond the 'extremely basic' type of deck. Some combinations of bad guys are much harder than others.

However, it's packed full of theme and some neat little touches on the cards which means it'll never be a total bust for a hardcore Potterite.

2017-12-05: Since having completed (and replayed) all seven years, changed rating from 9 to 7. It is still a great game - and the theme is perfect for my wife and I - but two factors have made me enjoy the game less:
1: Game length. It starts off at a nice 30-60 minutes but - because you simply keep adding more villains each Year - by Year 7 a full playthrough takes us 2-3 hours (which is fine for some games, but too much for this).
2. Uneven difficulty curve. This has been commented on by others already, but the difficulty curve is extremely unbalanced depending on which villains you draw early. We either know that we are going to lose within the first 10 minutes of play, or we win while still on Location 1. We have never won a Year 6 or 7 game where we lost Location 1 within the first hour.

Played the demo at Gen Con.  Played as Harry, which appears to make a difference due to the game building (?) inherent in the game.  (Apparently there are multiple levels of the game and things get added as you progress through different plays -- not exactly the same as a Legacy game, but something similar?) I wanted to like this, I REALLY did.  But it fell flat.  Had I played as Ron, might have felt differently -- his player got to put together some cool combos.  If this fell into my lap, I'd take it, but I add my voice to others in that I feel sorry for those who played with demoing it first.

RATING: 8
I can't explain it, but I love this game. It's not the most complex cooperative deck builder. It has difficulty balance issues. Sometimes the luck of the draw with villains will doom you out of the gate, and on the very next play, things will play out differently and you'll trounce the game by a landslide. But anyone can play it and it'll still engage board game enthusiasts and nerds. I love the variety of cards you can acquire, and what's pretty good about this one is that the game has means in which you can assist each other, which adds to player interaction. It really feels like a joint effort to win. The licensed art isn't half bad at all and the components are quality. 

I can't really articulate why, but I will play this game just about any time. It's just fun. Yes, it's a film licensed movie. It's a bit meatier than you might think, though. It's pretty well thought-out. If you like cooperative deck builders like me, I'd easily recommend this game. Even if you aren't a Harry Potter fanatic.

心得:
主題類卡牌構築遊戲算做的不錯的
最後一關難度頗高
一開始如果敵人能力太強基本上就不可能贏
不過主要還是卡牌構築
雖然有些為合作要素不過不強
還是看運氣跑流程的遊戲
策略點不高
規則:
*將地點卡照數字放好放到圖板左上，黑色藝術卡洗勻放在地點卡右邊，壞人卡洗勻放在地點卡下方，並開一張放下面，霍格華茲牌洗勻放圖版右上，開六張放到下方(進階玩家直接加入遊戲2跟3配件跟規則)
*每人拿一個圖板選一個腳色跟一張輪數卡，拿對應腳色起始手牌洗勻放圖版左邊，抽五張牌，拿生命標記放到圖板10位置
*遊戲輪流進行，直到擊敗所有壞人卡勝利，或是所有地點卡被壞人佔領失敗，每個玩家回合有四個階段
1.根據地點卡說明開對應張數的黑暗藝術卡並結算效果
2.結算壞人卡效果
3.玩家出牌行動  打出所有手牌拿對應資源，閃電放到想打的壞人卡下方，錢幣資源則支付後買霍格華茲卡，右下費用，拿到後放到棄牌堆，行動完的牌也放到棄牌堆
4.回合結束 如果地點卡上佔領標記超過上限則移除該地點卡跟所有佔領標記，如果是最後一張則失敗，如果壞人卡下方閃電大於卡片一下血量，移除壞人卡並拿獎勵，開新的補，補充霍格華茲卡區，所有此回合使用或未用的牌放到棄牌區，所有沒使用的資源棄掉，抽手牌到五張，沒牌抽將棄牌洗勻在抽
*增加難度 設置時地點卡可放一個佔領標記，更難則起始兩個，或是每張起始時一個
*當玩家血量歸0時不會再受到任何傷害，棄掉所有資源，棄掉一半手牌(向下取整，能使用棄掉效果)，將一個佔領標記到地點卡上，該回合結束時血量回到10
****Game 2***
*使用新的地點卡，其他卡片跟同類的洗允，其他規則相同
****Game 3***
*使用新的地點卡，其他卡片跟同類的洗允
*壞人卡總是開兩張，放傷害時可任意分配
*起始英雄卡有特殊能力，在自己行動階段可使用
****Game 4***
*使用新的地點卡，其他卡片跟同類的洗允，壞人卡開兩張
*多卡片可使用骰子效果，每一面的效果使每個玩家都會拿到
****Game 5***
*使用新地點卡，佛地魔卡放在壞人牌庫底開著，壞人卡開三張
*當最後三張壞人卡在下面時，佛地魔卡效果也啟動，要擊敗所有壞人卡才能傷害佛地魔
****Game 6***
*使用新地點卡，新佛地魔卡取代舊的
*新職業卡取代回合卡，每人起始選一張
****Game 7***
*使用新地點卡，新佛地魔卡取代舊的
*新英雄卡取代舊的，聖物卡照數字順序排好放中間開著，標記放一旁
*要將六個聖物都毀滅才能傷害佛地魔
*聖物效果會在對應行動階段啟動，要拿到丟骰的腳色卡並丟出對應符號時，可選擇不拿放標記在該牌上，放滿條件就移除拿該卡，可馬上使用上面效果

What a fun, cooperative experience! As a fan of the series, I was still hesitant, knowing most licensed games are swiftly published and shoved onto the market with no innovation or nuance; they're just marketing stunts. But! I was surprised to find a very pleasing, faithful, family-friendly game. This is a cooperative deck-building game which scales well with any number of players. Paulo and I journeyed through the series together as Harry and Ron and while I have some issues with the design, it is a fantastic game. The game can be divided into seven smaller games, one for each book/movie, with game play staying roughly the same for each one. I wouldn't want to spoil anything here, but the game matures along with our heroes, in difficulty and complexity. And though this may sound like a Disney-fied version of a campaign RPG, it isn't; your starting decks for each game remains the same, meaning all the hard work from the past is erased. Also, there is no way to "trash" cards or improve your hand; your deck just grows and grows. Still, I enjoy playing this game with friends as it acts as a buffer between aggressive Euros. Definitely a recommend for the experience for any Harry Potter fan or deck-building gamer.

Pros: Great theme, sense of difficuly ramps up and good co-op needed for healing/moneys etc

Cons: No removal of villains/cards in later years; your starting villains/hogwarts cards will determine if you have a chance or not. Game will go on for a while after you know you will win (i.e you have a good deck on the first location).

RATING: 8
"I have only played Games #1-3 (of the 7 in the box). This is a beautifully-presented gateway deckbuilder with a beloved theme. Games #1 and 2 were simple fun gateways. Game #3 is a solid light fun deckbuilder, although at 2p it seems quite easy to win. Game #4 brings in some challenge. Each game (except maybe #2) adds some interesting new mechanism.  "

What I like:
- Theme is very accessible to non-gamers
- Gorgeous presentation, from the box to the board to the card art
- Gameplay is straightforward but solid at first, with more and more twists
- Difficulty level for game 1 seemed about right (easy but a bit of tension)
- Game #1 and 2 (2p) took about 30-40 minutes

What I don't like:
- Card backs have very uneven coloring, so they are semi-marked
- From game #3 or 4, it's taking us 90+ minutes with 2 players, and game 7 is probably 2+ hours. 
- The game never allows for serious gamer-level strategy
- Difficulty of game 3 and beyond is pretty variable, depending on whether your decks ramp up before a certain in-game threshold. From that point on, it's either a walk in the park, or a rough go. 

Game 1 starts out very easy, with simple rules. Each box adds some new cards and maybe a new little rule or two. By around game 4, it's a nice gateway plus, although it runs longer than I would like. By game 7, it's a medium-weight game, where you have to remember several special abilities and when they trigger.

very thematic for me as a harry potter fans.
The component quality is just so-so , but the gameplay is quite fun and easy to grasp for beginner which increment the difficulty by each year/game. 

Currently beat all game 1 to game 7 ...
and lose in game 3, game 5,game 6...
the random of the villains have a lot of impacts..

Overall a good gateway game to introduce deck building and co-op idea to beginner... 

looking forward for the monster expansion, which still not available in my country ...

Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle is a cooperative deckbuilding game that seems to be aimed that gamers that are newer to the hobby. Players take on the role of one of four Hogwarts students, buying new and better cards for their decks in order to defeat various villains before they take over the scenario's locations. Players themselves cannot be killed, but upon reaching zero health, are stunned and allow further encroachment on the locations. The game features a sort of scaffolding in which players can play a scenario from one of the seven books, and each successive book adds new mechanisms to the game. This is a great system for people learning about the ins and outs of deckbuilding, but it may not hold that much interest for veteran gamers.

Love love love it! 4 of us played it, and although one in the group thought it was a letdown that they used movie stills (which I could care less about...I think it's great and will bring in a larger audience), we all absolutely loved it. Games 1 and 2 were pretty easy, and game 3 was so tense. We ended up losing it, so we're going to restart it and then continue on from there. I normally like to have something negative to say about a game, but as of yet I can't think of anything. It's perfect for all ages and game groups!

This is a hard game to rate. I don't think it's a great game, mechanically. We've played games 1-3 so far and we haven't even been close to losing. I am afraid that adding more box contents may make it more challenging / engaging, but also too long for the depth of the game. However, we've had a good time playing it. My partner loves HP and this is easy going, which she also likes. I find it is more like an activity than a game at this point.

If you love Harry Potter- A LOT, You will love this. I wasn't expecting much love for this game from all of the mixed reviews I have heard. After the Initial play I want more and more. OK, it is a simple deckbuilder but hey, I just don't care. I love Harry Potter more than I hate simple deckbuilders. I actually do like deckbuilders. Some minor issues that I have run into but not enough to keep me from playing it. Very enjoyable so far and I can't wait to continue on with the stories. (up to book 4 at the moment.) I really am happy I bought it. I will have to play with all of my Harry Potter friends who will appreciate it.

I really love this game and maybe that's because deck building and co-ops are favorites of mine and I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. Games 1 and 2 are a good way to ease in if you've never played a deck builder before, but you could skip right to 3 or 4 easily if you have. The cards are rather flimsy and the backing seems to wear quickly. I did have a couple of spell cards and some components from Box 7 that were damaged, but USAopoly sent me replacements for those items quickly.

This has been the game of our summer holidays, my youngest wanting to play every day. The motivation behind this want is mainly the surprise the boxes offer on opening (much like the Mole Rats Challenge envelope), but this is greatly helped by the fact the boys have seen 1-3 of the movies, so familiarity with the mythology gives more buzz.

Sadly the 90-120 min playing time compounded  by the repetitive nature of mechanisms has caused my eldest to lose interest (as does my 6yo at about the 75 min mark). Likewise I've enjoyed it, impressed by the content, but the script is too loose, the threats are not that threatening, so I'm now left with an interesting 'sandbox' of cards etc (I bought the expansion to fill in gaps of the stories) to experiment in tightening the script and hopefully reduce the playing time. So got my monies worth at Xmas.

Game starts off very basic, but by the time you get to game 6 there's a lot of interesting building options influenced by your proficiencies.  Game is way more difficult at higher player counts versus lower player counts.

This is an amazingly fun game. I have made a couple play troughs and have not completed it yet, but we are doing better and progressing. 
My only real quarrel with this game is that, so far, I have not seen a 'trash' mechanic, which is a mechanic I heavily play by. 
However, the flow of the game still seems solid even if the decks end up with some clutter. 
Easy to learn. Very thematic. It is definitely a game to have in the collection, even if you are not a fan of the series, you can still enjoy it.

RATING: 8.2
Tipikus pakliépítős játék, ahol a Harry Potter című könyv és film cselekményét és szereplőit.
Sok hasonlóság vélhető felfedezni a nagy előddel a Dominionnal. Persze vannak különbségek, mint hogy ez kooperatív játék a másikkal ellentétben.
Ami tetszik, hogy a karaktereink itt igazán épülnek, fejlődnek, ahogy az ellenség is.
Kezdésnek mindenki 10 lappal kezd, amiből 7 "pénz" és három akciólap van. A kör mindig azzal kezdődik, hogy kifordítunk egy Dark arts (sötét varázslat) kártyát, illetve az ellenfél lapját illetve lapjait. Ezután a húzóból 5 lapot használunk, akciózunk, majd dobóra tesszük. (mondom, Dominion). Majd jön a következő játékos. 
A játék két féle képen érhet véget, vagy legyőzzük az összes ellenfelet és kezdhetjük a következő film/könyv/doboz rejtélyeit megoldani.

I avoid this game for a long time as I thought it would be a fluff and no substance.  I got the game and really enjoyed it.  There are some cases were bad draws from the Hogwarts deck and the dark arts deck can make winning extremely difficult but for the most part it was well balanced.  The further in the game you progress the more options you have to over come obstacles even though they throw more challenges at you.

This has become one of my favorite deck-building games, though I think the theme has more to do with it than anything else. If I have one criticism, it's that it's almost too easy. With a good team, you'll have a hard time losing, though we've come close once, and when the villains started to combo abilities, we definitely felt the pressure.

Played through Game 1 and Game 2 thus far. A fairly dull cooperative deck builder with a fun theme that made me initially intrigued. Biggest issue thus far is simply that there aren't really any meaningful decisions and there isn't any tension as there isn't any challenge. But I'm hopeful the later boxes will open up some more content and that the later years will really shine. To the game's credit it does suggest experienced gamers start with Game 3, but given who I was playing with we played Years 1 and 2. Will revisit this rating upon later plays. 

UPDATE: Played Year 3 and updated this to a 7 from a 6. The game gets interesting during Year 3 with the difficulty really ramping up and more important decisions and strategy can be accomplished. Excited once again to keep playing through the remaining years.

After playing the first four games solo with two characters, I'm really enjoying the ride of the game.  I'm a Harry Potter fan and I like deck building so this should be up my alley.  Pretty streamlined with very few decisions early but once you get to game 3 and 4 the decisions become more interesting and you start to see some of the combos work.  the game is pretty easy to beat through 4 games but I've really enjoyed game 4 especially as the thematics start to come out and are fun as you describe what you are doing on your turn.  Still it's a light deck builder and if you aren't a Harry Potter fan than you probably won't like this one.    I thin my wife would like it too if she'd give it a try.

This would be much lower if the Harry Potter theme wasn't there (that's what drove me to complete all 7 games). 

There are issues with gameplay that should have been picked up during playtesting. A deckbuilding game without ability to clear limited draw pile or remove in-hand cards is asking for trouble. Swings between individual games was so variable it eventually forced my playgroup to set rules during setup ("no, we're not playing with those 3 villains face-up initially, because we're not masochists"). Rules are often unclear (why would the Death Eater trigger it's own effect before it's in play?), but answers via forums are available if you're so inclined. 

That said, it was really enjoyable to draw familiar allies, plan out spell distribution, and destroy villains you hate. Also, the quasi-legacy / storytelling aspect via added rules and cards as you progress through the games is nice.

Basically, if you like HP, you'll play through and get some enjoyment. If not, you'll likely hate it.

RATING: 6.5
Great fun for a family who all have read HP series. Has a legacy type of growth to it. Wich we enjoy. Goes by the years Harry attends Hogwarts school. 7 in total every year you all win you open the next box add in extra cards, other things, and slight changes in rules of the game. Well up to year 4 as far a we are. And game gets progressively harder. But kids are always excited to open next box. It is a good game.update way to random you get to a point and know with villains and prices of Hogwarts cards can't be won. Went sour with us really fast. All plays were 4 player. Played two player at Year six and went way easier almost to easy. 3 player may be sweet spot. Update nope just kinda random as in can be impossible to win or an absolute cake walk and rarely a struggle but doable type game. Shame cause when it is the latter it's really good.

RATING: 5
This was a gift to my partner, back when we were first starting our foray into the hobby. We played through almost all of the "books" straight, between two days. There was a surprising amount of challenge early on, and some interesting mechanisms were added as we plodded along, but once the strongest cards came out, it was almost -too- easy to win. Playing overly cautious is a very safe and reliable strategy here, which, ultimately contributed to an underwhelming endgame. 

(+) True to the theme. The "movie-cut" images do not detract from the gameplay.
(+) There is a surprisingly good deck-building engine beneath the HP-coating.
(+) There are a wide variety of cards and villains to encounter. They did not pull any punches, kudos to USAopoly.

(-) The challenge wanes as you gain access to more powerful abilities.
(-) There is no reliable way to thin your deck.
(-) Cards that remove dark marks are almost too strong, yet they are absolutely necessary per avoidance of the losing condition.

I believe there is a variant floating around out here that increases the difficulty, but also adds some rules to cycle the shop and thin your deck. We may look into that, someday.

The game is very enjoyable especially with those who are not too familiar with deck building. One of my complaint is that the game does not feel as thematic as it should be in very small instances. For example, you will be playing as a young Harry, Hermione, Ron, or Neville and will be fighting against an older Draco. Of course, this does not impact the game play at all and is still enjoyable. Other times, the game is very thematic and feels as if you are reliving the films. My only other complaint is that I wished that the card art would have been drawn rather than using movie stills. But if you are a Harry Potter fan, this is a must buy!

RATING: 9
I was pleasantly surprised when I started playing this game.  It was surprisingly easy to learn and has enough depth to make it challenging.  It also has nice storage features in the box.  Even though I typically like miniature gaming most, I highly recommend this game.
After playing this game more intensively we find it very difficult by game 7 , even more so with 4 players.  We have played games 5-7 at least 30x about a 50% win ratio. Some starting villain combinations along with poor random Hogwarts cards starting distribution makes it nearly impossible to win (not a fan of that).  I find the mechanics to be surprisingly complex, giving the game quite a bit of replay ability.  For those that find this a simple game (perhaps I am misinterpreting their comments as this is an easy game to win), please enlighten me with some tips for winning with a starting set of villains with Bellatrix, the Dementor/Greyback, and Barty/Peter Pettigrew. Combine those villains with the six starting cards available for purchase with costs of 6 or 7.
The Only reason I don't rank the game as a 10 is the lack of a scaling mechanic to offset the random 'auto-lose' draws.

It was easy to learn, quick and each player's unique ability leans you to use them in a certain way. It feels like an RPG, yet offers no way to develop your character.

This is one deckbuilder that won't have a bunch of expansions. I have issues with the ever expanding list of card interaction questions I have, with games with large or growing card pools. Or so many not well-written, streamlined keywords and rules, that questions get exponential for me with the addition of new content. firefly is bad at this. Evolution has much fewer types of cards per game, so not nearly as bad, but as the number of expansions grow, I need to keep things in check there. And yes, I know you play with a fairly set pool of cards per game, but the promos create an ever expanding list of variables that can go in any game, thus multiplying the questions.

Anyway. Harry Potter, should have little issue with that, lol.

Na ten moment najlepsza kooperacyjna gra deckbuildingowa w jaką grałem. Do tego klimat Harrego Pottera się wręcz z niej wylewa. Nadaje się idealnie także dla osób nie grających, ponieważ system książek jest tak skonstruowany, że pierwsze gry są bardzo proste (zarówno pod względem skomplikowania zasad jak i poziomu trudności gry), a każda kolejna dodaje dodatkowe zasady, z którymi gracze oswajają się na bieżąco oraz zwiększa się trudność rozgrywki. Faktycznie czuć tutaj tę kooperację i ostatnie książki stanowią spore wyzwanie nawet dla ogranych graczy, trochę szczęścia bywa przydatne :) Co prawda po przejściu całości nie widzę zbytnio sensu w granie inaczej niż korzystając z zasobów wszystkich książek (chyba, żebym wprowadzał jakiegoś całkiem zielonego gracza), ale niczego to nie psuje, jeśli potraktujemy po prostu wszystkie pozostałe książki jako coś w rodzaju tutoriala, gdzie głównym daniem jest ostatnia przygoda.
Co do samej rozgrywki, brak mi tu w sumie trochę jakiejkolwiek możliwości odrzucania kart z decku, co nie pozwala na większą kontrolę nad zawartością talii.

As an avid fan of the books and the movies, I'm glad that we played through from Game 1, rather than skipping ahead as recommended for "Advanced Wizards"
I do suggest starting games with 2-3 control tokens on the locations and/or increase the Villains deck for more of a challenge. Fighting back the villains was too easy otherwise. The Encounters from the Monster Box can really hamper success. Overall, an enjoyable deck builder that pairs well with HP music in the background.

Another fairly typical deck builder. Nothing remarkable. The game is played over seven sessions (each one representing a year at Hogwarts). One of my biggest gripes with this game is that for some reason you keep fighting villains you have already defeated. So in year four you'll inexplicably fight Professor Quirrell even though you already killed him during year one. . . makes no thematic sense. Pretty blah. In a market that is completely over saturated with deck builders, this is one you can skip.

A nice way to introduce newer gamers to co-ops/deck-builders, as the early years are really simple.  By the seventh year, the game is moderately complex, but it all builds upon rules and principles from previous games.  Getting to open a new box of content each year was fun and familiar of legacy games, but at the end of the day this probably isn't a co-op I'm going to re-visit.  For whatever the reason, I'm not a huge fan of co-op deck-builders.  Also, a bit on the easy side.

Very limited strategic options (pick the cards that match your character's abilities or lose) once reaching years 4 and 5, yet still very random: making the same choices with all 4 characters, one Year 4 game was lost with only one villain defeated, while the next one was won without losing a location.

Still a fun game with children, or Harry Potter fans, or children who are Harry Potter fans, but I'm hoping Years 6 and 7 will introduce more room for player agenda.

I demoed this game at Gen Con. It's a very generic deckbuilding game. There wasn't anything new or groundbreaking about it. I'm a big fan of Harry Potter, but I found this game to be pretty boring.

There weren't really any cooperative elements to it. I could do very little to aid my allies, and when it wasn't my turn, I couldn't do anything but sit and wait.

The artwork was just whatever random screen captures they could grab from the movies, and they weren't even consistent. On Harry Potter's card, he looks eleven years old, while Draco Malfoy's card shows him as seventeen!

I feel sorry for the people who purchased it before playing it... they will be sorely disappointed. If you want a FUN coop deck building game, try one of Upper Deck's Legendary games, or iello's Big Book of Madness.

RATING: 6.5
It's a mediocre deck-builder but if you're into the Harry Potter theme it brings it up a notch. 

As you unlock packs and more game options, the length of the game really increases which is HUGE minus. That, and the fact that there is no deck culling mechanism means your deck is susceptible to bloat (which is pretty much inevitable).

RATING: 9
Excellent family game but also fun for gamers. It starts fairly easy but can be a real challenge depending on when the enemies come out and in what order and combination.  I've only played half way through the boxes but am totally hooked.

Update: After playing all the "games", I absolutely love this! I've even played alone, which I rarely do with games in real life. The 6th "game" is the hardest, in my opinion, since the 7th adds a new twist that is just brilliant--as well as totally thematic. No spoilers--get the game if you love Harry.

It's a fun coop card game with a good amount of intensity. There is enough strategy to be fun, but it's not very deep. The atmosphere of the game is excellent -- playing it with the movies on in the background is a magical experience for anyone who loves Harry Potter.

There are two big flaws:
1. The game is balanced on razor wire, and luck plays a huge role. If you get the right cards you win by a landslide, if you get the wrong cards you get stomped. There is very little in between.
2. There is very little sense of progression as you move between phases of the game, which I find very frustrating and un-fun. It's a deckbuilding game. You spend all this time building your deck, but then you move on to the next phase and you have to throw it all away.

That said, if you enjoy Harry Potter it is definitely worth playing. The full game is very long (a plus in my book), but it's broken up into 7 phases that you can easily spread out over multiple play sessions.

As cooperative deck-builders go, this one strikes the right balance between group goals and feeling a sense of individual achievement.  However, I was hoping that as a chapter-based game, the deck I built each time would continue to grow, instead of losing all that I worked for in order to progress to the next chapter.  If you're looking for a legacy game, you won't find it here.  As a result, there can be a certain amount of fatigue as we unlock the same cards, each time round.

Has become a favorite in my house as the kids are able to play with me (kids are 8 & 10). Starts off as a very basic, introductory level deck builder. As you progress through each game box (seven, one for each book) more cards, events, enemies and mechanisms are incorporated to increase the complexity/difficulty of the experience. Highly recommend for HP fans and those who are looking for a thematic deckbuilder to play with family.

Fantastic intro to deck builders for me and my 6yo daughter because it starts off basic and each gamebook introduces new mechanics. Theming keeps daughter's interest, and we are both really excited to open new gamebooks full of new characters and spells. This has replaced all of our other games as her absolute favorite.

Fun deckbuilder. Theme feels a little slapped on, but whatever, people love HP, and those people are the people least likely to notice that it's slapped on. I would enjoy the game without a theme, and there are people who would enjoy anything harry potter themed.

It's fun. i really enjoy finding out about new rules and mechanics and components through play!

I would recommend to ANY Harry Potter fan.  While the gameplay is a touch simplistic (meant for a young audience) it still has challenge enough for adults and some interesting mechanisms.  Really good game, and exceeded expectations.  Would be interested in playing the entire gambit, since so far I've only played 'Book 5'

RATING: 6
Enjoyable deck-building core. The gradual addition of new content in each game is fun. Later games run too long for what it is. Not a lot of variety once you reach the final game, since you use all the villains and obstacles. Prone to snowballing. Economy doesn't work well. Enjoyed for one play-through of the campaign, but not sure I see a lot of repeat plays for it.

Looks like a fun co-op and sounds interesting how you open up new packets as you progress the game (different books). Like a legacy but not a legacy game. Does it have replay-ability? Or would the fact that there are several packets make the game worth it even if just play through once

Decently fun co-op deckbuilding game.  Each wizard has a minor power that can be used effectively.  We played one of the introductory "books" and it seemed pretty easy.  We did get to a point where the cost of all the card in the market were in the 5+ range, so the game stalled until we could clear the roadblock which took several turns.

This is a very well done introductory deck-building game that is great for fans of the Harry Potter books/films. As you progress through the 7 games, more rules are added and the game becomes more challenging. This is why it is a good introduction to deck building, it starts very basic and gets more interesting. That being said, game play is pretty simple so may be boring for a more advanced gamer.

[b]Finally, a good Harry Potter game (and not just because it's Harry Potter)![/b]
My wife is a huge Harry Potter fan and I have been trying for years to find a good HP game, but they are all garbage.  I heard some good things about this, so I picked it up as a gift for her.  Turns out, it's actually a really good game!

First off, it's cooperative.  Any HP game [i]should[/i] be cooperative (or possibly 1 vs many).  But, it's also cooperative in the sense that you are actually doing things to cooperate with each other.  Other co-op deckbuilders I've played like [thing=129437][/thing] and [thing=112092][/thing] are just cooperative in the sense that you are fighting the same enemy.  In Hogwarts Battle, a lot of your cards and abilities involve directly helping your teammates.  I find this mechanic far more enjoyable.

Secondly, it scales properly.  So many co-ops have a constant stream of bad stuff coming at you.  With deckbuilders, that means you start off super weak and the bad guys walk all over you.  Eventually, if you are lucky, you are able to reverse the momentum and prevent the bad guys from winning.  At that point, you already have the momentum and you run downhill, crushing the enemies until you eventually meet the win condition.  In Hogwart's Battle, the game scales well.  Things start off relatively slow, but they escalate as the game goes on to match pace with the players.

Third, there are actually a lot of decisions to make.  Most deckbuilders mostly only have a decision of which card to buy.  Sometimes the sequence of card play is obvious, but often your turns are straightforward.  In Hogwart's Battle, A LOT of the cards have the word "or".  Get 2 bucks or draw a card.  Get 2 bucks or give 1 buck to each player.  Do 1 damage or heal 2 hit points.  Do 2 damage or draw 2 cards.  You are constantly making meaningful decisions [i]in addition to[/i] the decision of which card to buy.  Plus, there are always 3 villains to attack and it can be a very hard choice to decide which one to take out first.

Fourth, the game is super accessible.  The HP theme shines through about as well as one could expect from a deckbuilder.  Also, there is kind of a campaign aspect where you add cards and complexity book by book.  A nongamer could pick this up at book 1 and learn how deckbuilders work.  By book 7 you get an epic battle with layers of mechanics that even veteran gamers will struggle against.  The rules are fairly simple and very clear.

Overall, this is a very good co-operative deckbuilder that also has a reasonably strong Harry Potter theme.  My wife loves it and we have played it for 5 nights straight.  Definitely a keeper!

Great game!  We lost so many games.  It is very important to play to your characters' strengths, especially as the game progresses.  4th year kicked our butts until we could get people to stop taking cards that needed to go to other players to stack abilities.

RATING: 9
Some complain that this game is too easy.  I'd agree that some games are quite easy, however, this is a great game to play with your children (both my 6 year old twins play and my 10 year old even plays it solo sometimes), and some of the games within it scale fairly well.  Games 3, 6, and 7 I believe are the most difficult which seems appropriate.  You can create a challenge if you desire or you can play it very casually.  Personally, the ability to play co-op with my kids and model losing well makes this a good social, emotional teaching tool.

RATING: 10
A Harry Potter game that fits the theme of up to four Gryffindor heroes battling against the odds. It succeeds by incorporating a great theme, having amazing cooperative play, and including a system of increasing challenge that makes me excited to play again, even starting from the beginning! It has been a great 2 player game, drags a bit at 3, and was frustrating in my one try at 4 players due to downtime and nasty villain powers.

I'm interested in some small variants such as start with 8 health or reduce health max by 1 after each stun; or must move through the locations such as stage any Voldemort battle at last location.

Difficulty can vary wildly depending on the order of event cards that pop up and which villains are in play.  Overall, we love the game and are excited to finish it.

Fantastic game, and that coming from someone who dislikes deckbuilders.  Starts off easy and simplistic, and introduces new concepts and new challenges with each new game box (one for each year).  Year 1 is a simple breeze, while Year 7 took us 2 1/2 hours of constant strategizing and planning.  Components are top notch and beautiful.

I am not into the Harry Potter theme but this game is enjoyable.  My wife loves this co-op and is into the theme more than myself.  Games can be a bit of a grind in the later "books".

RATING: 7.5
Hogwart's Battle was a surprise hit for me. As a deck-builder, it is a bit lacking compared to all of the newer designs out there. But it is a fun (if imbalanced) co-op, that really oozes out the Harry Potter theme. It captivated my non-gamer wife enough for several plays. The game expands as you advance through the movies, which is a nice way to ramp the complexity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Fantastic both for teaching deck builders and as a game that gets harder gradually over time. I join everyone in saying its a great couples game especially when your partner loves the series as much as mine does. You can complain about the only movie art and cheap pieces, but everything else including the insert and how nicely organized everything is makes this game extremely well made.

The theme on this is on point.  The deck-building portion plays well and like most other deck-builders.  I like games that have bad stuff happening every turn almost.  I've found it too easy but have only played through year 4, so have more to go.  Looking forward to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fantastic introduction to deck-builder style games.  the "7 games" model allows for customization of the game to the group's player abilities and also allows for shorter games if wanted.  
I am always skeptical of movie or tv show themed games as they are typically an existing weak game with updated overlay to reflect the theme.  Not the case here.  great game with lots of replayability.  
I would only consider on downside, the cards and cardboard tokens are bit flimsy.  We've only played a handful of times and the edges look worn and the deck has that 'fluffy' appearance that 20 year old playing cards get.  I might invest in sleeves.

There are some minor balancing issues. Most games are heavily one sided, whether winning or losing. However, the game is very thematic, a delight to play, and very well thought out.

I'm having fun playing this.  I don't know if my rating will go up or down once I open all the boxes (as of this writing we have played the first 4).  Right now, the game seems pretty easy (with two).  I feel it should be a little harder for my rating to rise.  The art is fine and the theme shines through.  I've had some component problems with poorer than average cards and tokens and one of the rule books was missing.

What [i]Hogwarts Battle[/i] brings to the deck-building arena:

A heartwarming theme enjoyed by most families.

A progression through all seven movies, each with different locations and new cards and/or mechanics.

Character powers that are always in effect (similar to DC Comics Deck-Building).

One or more random events at the start of each player's turn.  These are always bad.

Multiple villains in play (in later scenarios), each with ongoing effects. Much of the game's decision-making is about which villain(s) to target first, particularly when separate villain effects interact in a nasty way.

Two types of currency: money and attack/damage.  Damage is assigned to villains and carries over from turn to turn.

Occasional card-card (or card-character) interactions, particularly if you cooperate and allow other players to purchase cards that complement their powers/decks.

Weak cardstock that, like Legendary, probably needs to be wrapped in penny sleeves.

A complete lack of deck-thinning.  There isn't a single card that allows another card to be destroyed.

[o]Dice-rolling card effects that benefit all players.  Not a huge spoiler, since dice are listed as components on the game box, but a spoiler nonetheless.[/o]

Final thought: This game can be punishing - particularly in later scenarios - which means that it isn't ideal for young kids.  Based on the difficulty level, Hogwarts seems more appropriate for teen families or adult Potter fans.

Our family has played through the entire campaign, and some of the "books" a few times.

A fun deckbuilder with a somewhat legacy approach to introducing the game play. There are 7 different games with 1 being for absolute beginners and 7 being pretty tough. There are also variable player powers which is a nice touch that sets it apart from other deckbuilders.

Played this one exclusively with the wife. We absolutely loved it. Started at game two, had our first loss at game 5, and eventually we were able to beat game 7.

Not sure if I'll return to this one, but completely worth what was paid and we had an absolute blast. 

If I had any complaints it would be that by the time you reach game 7 the games will be 90+ minutes :(
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is as great of a licensed game as I've played. My friends and I are up to game 6 and are have a general hoot playing. The theme is spot on, and there are wonderful moments of tension when a little luck can send a player surging in power, allowing them to drop a strong enemy in a single turn. But there are cons. The games can start to drag on for ages once you have all the villains. There is also the issue of too much RNG. If you get hard villains to start and expensive cards or too many of one type in the beginning the game never really picks up. But the thing that takes the experience out of this game the most for me is the "sit down and take it" experience of the Dark Arts cards. There are a few cards/powers that save you in a pinch, but mostly you just sit and hope for the best, often time ending up with few cards when your turn rolls around. 

Ultimately this is a great intro to deck building, and the way the games build on each other makes it perfect for folks of varying experience levels. Even with the unbalanced aspects, it is an exciting co-op experience for young and old fans of Harry Potter alike.

We loved this game so much. It helps that we are all Harry Potter dorks and even pretended to cast spells. Honestly though getting into the theme really made this so enjoyable. Playing this with party poopers wouldn't be as enjoyable.

That being said this is a very easy game to teach. It brings enough of a challenge that keeps us coming back.

Very happy with this game, and we recommend to any group of 4.

The game is rather swingy, and while house rules help maintain tension longer, it's either "in the bag" or "all hope is lost".  That said, I still enjoy this incredibly thematic deck builder and won't hesitate to play with friends.

Haven't completed the full "campaign mode" but done up through year 4.  It's a relatively standard co-op deckbuilder, but I definitely like the way the unboxing happens over several games. The components are nice ... the cardboard is decent quality, the little metal skulls are AWESOME.  I do wish the board was a Legendary-style playmat instead of being a board, as the cards do slide around quite a bit.  Also, what's up with the card sizes?  The location/villian cards are a weird size for which sleeves don't exist, and the Dark Arts cards are too big for 70mm square but far too small for 80mm square - basically, no sleeves exist for these either. It would have been nice to be able to sleeve those since there's not multiple copies of each.

RATING: 9
As a giant fan girl its hard not to give it a 10 but I am going to have to go with a nine due to some few confusing directions of how to read a card. Overall this was the best build a deck game I have ever played! This is a great game for people that have issues with competition- this is a game where the players work together! We played with someone who had never seen the movies or read the books and typically isnt all that interested in games- she loved it! 

Its unfortunate that some of the directions resulted in us having to google online for how to play- if that wasn't the case it would have been a 10!

With the minor misstep of USAopoly forgetting some components, or duplicating others (I had to return my copy and get another, it was missing Game 1 villains), this game is rather compelling. Game one was easy, Game two was a little harder, Game three was easy, but currently, my group is stuck on Game 4. The Dark Arts cards just take away too much Health. That aside, I do like this game and it does push a need for teamwork. The layout and stills from the movies flow easily into this game and layer the theme on.

Standard card drafting, deck building game, with super game play locked to the theme.  If you like Harry Potter, you'll like this.  Each book is represented by additional rules and difficulty, and thematic elements.  Nice.

Well, the game we got was missing a bunch of cards so we only got through the tutorial. Seems good though. I was fine but is based on denial which I hate

Very cool introductory deck builder game. My wife and I enjoyed it immensely, and the gradual increases in difficulty allowed her to catch on to deck building strategy. I used this game to introduce my wife to Legendary, which is my favorite game.

Fun deck-builder that's dripping in theme. Deck builders is a favorite genre for myself and my SO making this a clear choice when it was announced given the Harry Potter theme behind the game. 

Components and production quality is quite nice. The game isn't incredibly innovative, but it's still fun and a solid deck builder

Szuper játék, nagyon jól sikerült a Dominion retheme és a "legacy" mód ötvözése, élvezetes és nagyon izgalmas a kooperatív varázslás. Harry Potter, Hermione és a többiek a választható karakterek között, míg Tudjukki és alattvalói a másikon. Igényes, jó minőségű, bár a filmből kiollózott fotók nem a kedvenceim, itt nem zavart, panaszkodni nem érdemes miatta, a játék nagyon egyben van.

Great fun for Harry Potter fans, good co-op action, like the increasing challenge each 'year'

This is a good simple yet fun card game in which you build your deck through out the game taking on an increasingly difficult game. Very simple to learn and great for a family game night.

Usually I like to review a game after three plays, but these three plays were all done on the same night and only constitute the first two books. I will rate after a few more plays.

Great game, everyone I have played it with loves it, we even tricked it out with eight inch wands to cast spells with, great addition. So much fun, has kept us up numerous times into the wee hours of the morning. HP rocks it!

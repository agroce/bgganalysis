RATING: 1
First off I love Aliens and Predator. But its such a shame that prodos released this game. Theyre a terrible company. Ive dealt with them before and had nothing but problems as have my local games store. You get different information from different people and lied to constantly. I want the game due to the AVP theme thats it. If it wasnt AVP I woulnt waste my time with any prodos games ever. Tried Warzone and hated it. After preordering I heard AVP uses the same system not sure what to think. Hope the game is good when it gets here finally. Other wise it will be the biggest let down in years. If its good I will change my comments.

I like the look of the game, but the manual makes it tough to learn, and when you do you find the system clunky and difficult to use with unbalanced factions. Minis are nice looking but hard to assemble. It looks great on the table but the game needs to be better.

I call this game AvP: The Disappointment Begins. When you look past the amazingly detailed models, you're just left with so many rules, a poor manual, imbalance issues, incomplete or unclear situations, and an absolute b!tch of a mess to set up and tear down. Had to put all my board pieces into another box because they won't fit back. If you love spending most of your time flicking through a manual every turn to check a rule or calculating attack/dodge/defense & modifiers, this game is for you. Other wise this just disappoints.

[Comments based on 2nd edition]

I really enjoy this game as it captures the theme well, but it has some hangups. It's a very rules-heavy game with clear ties to miniature gaming. There are exceptions and bloated elements that probably should have been developed out. Stuff such as the infested corridors and ping tokens don't have a huge impact on typical plays for instance.

Also, the game is very dice heavy and features a ton of rolling. Like Space Hulk, a series of bad rolls can leave you completely hosed as your flank caves in and you're facing decimation.

But, those wild swings and unexpected outcomes also fuel a system that is narratively focused. Excellent bits of story emerge as you seal doors, flame thrower Yuatja, and have aliens burst out of your chest. I really enjoy this one despite the obvious flaws.

I do not want a model kit to spend hours of time for to glue together horrible manufactured  plastic-parts (some of them delivered already broken) which I also have to carve in shape like a surgeon!
I do not want to spend hours and hours reading forums and threads trying to answer a billion questions the rules (thats what at least prodos calls it - i won't) leave open to interpretation. I do not want house rules, i want a game that works.
I do not want to read rules in the basic game which i only need for expansions (facehuggers? Shotguns?)
I do not want to create an overwiew by myself to keep in mind every single one of the many, many details for combat.
I want a much more creative single player mode (actually bought this game for single play).
I want missions that work well with 2 players.
I want rules translated by someone who speaks my language correctly or at least uses the error-correction-function of his software. (No, don't blame me for my english - i don't translate rules...)
I want the cards fully translated, not only parts oft them.
I want fun !!!
Waiting for the redesigned rules - if not better: See you at eBay!
This game reeeeally disappointed me...

Great miniatures,
Great overall game that's reminescent of Space Hulk 1st edition. Great boardgame on it's own with much more replay value than Space Hulk and Claustrophobia, which are it's closest cousins in term of games. Can be expanded with different minis, but they are uneeded really.

Just wish we could have a better armour rules system.

There ARE some slight oversights in the rulebook that need answering in a FAQ, but nothing major. You HAVE to use the 2.0 ruleset though.

The game rides on it's license. If you are not into AvP, this game will probably be mediocre to you.

A very fun game with great miniatures (which are a pain to put together).
The licence is ace and the missions are pretty good.

I enjoy it a lot despite its flaws. But it could have been 20% better with just a little more effort.

Kickstarter changed to "Get to the Chopper 300+" ...long time undecided, and I was stupid to back a PRODOS GAME...

Spent so many money for nothing...

Edit: ...deleted...
Edit 2: added another pledge level to my first pledge above "We're in the Pipe, Five by Five." to get a better value by adding more miniatures. (Total 360+)
Edit 3: added another small things before closing my pledge. (Total 384+)

Edit 4: MAY 05th 2016 - WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM PRODOS:

After two years I'm having nothing else than a simple base game, and all here could purchase easily many of cheap expansions from hobby stores or direct at amazon since month... I'm still waiting for my pledge content. Please be aware of this before you decide to "back" any project from Prodos or you want to throw away your money...

Edit5: update October 14th-2016
After forcing them to delivery before the game fair Spiel 2016 in Germany to avoid implications at the fair..., closing the booth with laywer or a possible confiscation of their stuff at the fair, in front of possible customers and other publishers, they delivered (after 2.5 years...) most of the remaining pledge:
- 1x Base Game, 19x + 5x Facehuggers, 3x Predator Bereserker, 1x Predalien, 3x Alien Warrior (5), 2x Alien Royal Guard, Hellhounds (2), 2x Sentry Guns (2), 2x Master Sergeant, 1x Colonial Marines (5), 1x Power Loader, Predator Young Bloods (3), 1x Lieutenant Linn Kurosawa, 1x Major Dutch Schaefer, 1x Predator Ship Tiles,
Object Marker: Predator Spear (4), Half synthetic (4), 2x Alien Eggs (4).

Still missing: All three Cloaked Predators (Spear, Disc, Ranged), Hardback Rulebock... (will this be the unplayable old editions rules or the new 2,0 (released after 2-and-a-half-year...)?, all Dice Sets (twice): Predator, Aliens, Marines...

Hope it was no other lie to save more time before angry backers..., a new management will take place now soon and handle the open issues!
Keep you informed.

First two base boxes in english arrived in September. 
Now expecting all add-ons and KS stuff following by end of the year.


What the hell do you think about your backers and former supporter/fans...

Expected delivery MAY 2014 – we’re having now MAY 2016! 
And I’m sitting here with a base game. 
I pledged for over $400 two years ago, now everybody is playing AVP, you could easily sell
from many hobby stores and from amazon handful of expansions and add-ons and you’re
backers still sitting outside and loosing not only the faith in PRODOS, no, you make me feel
worse playing AVP, I’M not looking forward to play, I’m looking forward only to end this and 
may sell my game immediately after receiving, that I have no rememberings on Prodos or
that KS-odyssey. Two years now and I see no end near.


I want you to check my pledge, no. 2.033 and arrange a delivery of my pledge within the next
two weeks. After that you could stop sending worthless notices and reminder of your company
and products. Belive me, I will never back and purchase any Prodos stuff.

I expect your answer within the next days. And, no. No appologize, after two years with nothing
in my hand and you make me feeling worse to want playing a game I was so excited to get, I 
don’t need any more appologize or empty promises. I WANT MY GAME NOW.


Looking forward to your delivery.

RATING: 1.5
Absolutely not my kind of game. Just hours of dice rolling.

The components are not good. Tiny tokens you have to use to indicate activations that are very fiddly to handle. Setup of board/mission is time consuming. Unclear rules. For instance, every action a character is able to perform should be written on the character cards. But no healing possiblity is stated on any predator character card though they shold be capable of healing. 

Extreme reliability on luck. During the second match that I played, I controlled the Alien faction against the Marines. One of the first actions of the Marine player was a special shot around a corner that killed half of my army. Unfortunately, mass is the only advantage of the Alien player. Thus, it was foreseeable that I would lose. Nevertheless, the game still lastet over an hour while I was trying to get into close combat which never happened. So I just rolled dice for an hour to defend myself until I lost every unit without harming the my opponent at all.

Worst gaming experience ever.

I would assume that 2nd edition would have clear rules, I've read comments that indeed they are better... still there are few spots that could use better phrasing.
Other than that, there isn't much to pick on. Figures look great - are fragile though but you hardly can complain about it since they are delivered in nice foam packaging.
It's a great game for it's price, I find it to be a middleground between Gears of Wars  and Omega Protocol (in terms of complexity and time it requires). 


Word of advice - prepare a big table for this game, 80cm in width is bare minimum for small maps.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Component quality is terrible, rules are dense and badly formatted without any reasonable quality reference sheets, minis are small, poorly detailed and very hard to assemble and the graphic design is ugly, to boot. The gameplay has some interesting ideas in it, but the core box is not well balanced or designed to provide even a simple level of satisfying experience (only two types of Xenomorph models, neither with ranged attacks) and only allows for scenarios with exactly 3 players, despite advertising the game as playable by 1+ players. (There is a 1/2 player 'survival mode' which is completely watered down)

RATING: 8
This is a lovely game for fans of the fiction. Beautiful miniatures, a compelling setting and an interesting balance of squad abilities. A game that pits 5 human marines against 15 Aliens and 3 Predators wears its heart on its sleeve in terms of each side having different strengths and weaknesses. Add to that a modular board and this is a skirmish game with lots of replay value.

As a whole, its let down by its weaker elements. A very poorly written set of rules make the first few games an exercise in confusion until house rules are in place and a few clarifications and corrections are hunted down. Also, the campaign is really designed to be played by exactly three players. In two player, many of the campaign goals no longer make sense or are unbalanced*. For whatever the quirks of my own social arrangement, I find that I rarely have exactly three players for boardgame evenings. However, purely played as a team versus team killing game, it seems to work just as well with two or three players.

*An example. In one of the campaigns, the Alien is tasked with killing 5 points worth of enemy units AND infecting three locations. In a two player game the entire Predator or Human side is worth 5 points. So, the Alien only really needs to wipe out the player's units and therefore getting to strategic locations becomes an obsolete task.

Review for second edition board game only. A highly tactical and at times quite tense hybrid board/miniatures game. We've had moments that have actually felt cinematic. Every mission you learn more about how to play your faction. You get a lot of game for your money too. Rule book is very poor though, god knows how bad the first edition book must have been.

This was the first and only time I'll buy a game, with out reading a review, I felt let down, I played it 4 times and it's been on the self ever since. How ever if you use the models in space hulk, a broad grin appears

 The pros
All the components are brilliant, and the models are amazing (apart from the cards)

Cons
The rule book is all over the place, and rules themselves are just bad
The cards are terrible, with poorly space out text
The art work on the back does not clearly mark out which faction it belongs to

[b]9: Excellent game. Always a pleasure to play. Shines under most circumstances.[/b]

I have no history with their kickstarter, and I am commenting about the 2nd edition as a solo player. 

I [i]really[/i] love this game, it's thematic, it's tense, it's hard, it's got a ton of replay ability right out of the box, not to mention the addition of Alien, Marine, and Predator forces for more variety of everything.* It provides a completely different experience than the Legendary Encounters: Alien series (Which is a '10' for me as well).

2nd edition rules were easy to understand, the great play aids here keep track and flow of everything. I [b]do[/b] play with the random mission objectives, even as solo, this helps the replay ability greatly. It's very easy to raise or lower the difficulty as well. 

It would be a '10' for me if it wasn't for those ridiculously tiny and thin 'Activated, Sentry, Hidden' tokens and lack of a player aid chart. I upgraded those tokens with plastic 'Activated, Overwatch, and blue tokens to denote 'Hidden' from Litko. I also purchased some 'Acid Splatter' tokens to denote wounds on the Alien troops such as the 'Crusher', 'Queen', 'Predalien' and 'Royal Guard'. Something to track their health should have been provided in box as well. 

*[size=7]I love the setting, I own and have read the entire Dark Horse comic series of Aliens, AVP, and Predator, own and have watched all the movies multiple times. YMMV if you do not enjoy the theme, if you do,
 this game drips it.[/size]

Love the game.  For those who have played Space Hulk, it's similar but much better than that.  Pick one of the three factions (Colonial Marines, Aliens or Predator Figures) to battle within the interior of a spaceship. You can even adapt the figures and rules to standard miniature wargaming.  It's hard not to get into a game based on such incredible genre pieces such as Aliens and Predator.  It is sci-fi action movie nostalgia at it's finest.  Replayablity, is nearly unlimited due to the tile construct elements and mission cards.  The figures once assembled are amazing and very well detailed with almost no flash and mold lines.  The rules are pretty simple as far as miniature games go.  A single page quick reference rule sheet is pretty handy until every grasps the basics.  The game components are pretty well made and the playing cards, tokens, and game tiles are high quality and durable.  On the downside, if you have no experience painting and assembling 28mm miniatures, you will likely have great difficulty basing and assembling the figures.  
Don't expect to play the game out of the box.  It will take 4-5 hours to simply assemble and base the miniatures properly (not to mentions days and weeks to paint them).  If that sounds daunting to you, this game isn't for you.  This game is designed for experienced miniature gamers to assemble after that, it's suitable for any gamers with little or no miniature gaming background.  You get 23 miniatures and game components which compensate for the high price of the game.  Like many games with numerous preassembled components, you'll definitely have to find a separate suitable container to safely transport and store the figures which are fragile even if not detailed and painted.

It's... ok? Playable after reading updated rules and with a will to house rule things. If it wasn't for the IP and some of the best miniatures on the market, nobody would notice it. At least it's original in that it's designed from ground up for 3 players, finding a niche giving it a shot at tabletime it wouldn't otherwise get. Waiting for the 2ed to see if it updates the rules and the Unleashed wargame which from the start seemed Prodos' primary goal, so hopefully it will turn out more solid.

Pros:
- very thematic, play a soundtrack with it and you are right in a movie
- factions play very different
- great miniatures, right on the spot
- close games, very often down to the last mini/ game turn

Cons:
- some components are really bad (looking at you, tokens)
- mission objectives repetetive, story could be more fleshed out
- a few balancing issues
- heavy dependence on dice rolls can spoil the experience

Very, very nice (if fiddly) miniatures, but it is such a shame that the rest of the components and the rule set do not do them justice. The tiles and tokens are lacklustre and badly designed in some instances, with barely legible and badly worded text and thin card stock. The rules are probably also too complex and wargame-oriented for the average boardgamer who wants quick, clear and concise gameplay, but the rules as they currently stand won't appeal to a lot of hardcore wargamers either due to lack of balance, clarity, depth and unique flavour. Don't even get me started on the lack of proofreading. Many owners are complaining about what is essentially a broken rule set and are now home-brewing their own, which should tell you all you need to know. 

As of May 2016 I have still only received around two thirds of the items I pledged for back in 2013, despite most of them being available to retail customers since mid-2015. I'm also well aware that there are a great many backers who have still yet to receive anything at all.

For me this game has been forever tainted by the toxic Prodos experience and combining this with the aforementioned issues has meant that I've now sold on everything I have so far received. What a missed opportunity.

A very enjoyable miniatures skirmish game crossed with a dungeon crawler.  It is fiddly, very luck dependent, and perhaps half-baked in some areas, but it's also extremely fun, highly thematic, and looks great on the table.  I'm impressed and want to play more.

For the cost of this friggin game you think you get built models.  Not to mention the models are frail and tough to assemble.

V simple ruleset and well laid out rules book make this a simple game to get playing quickly. The minis are excellent and there's massive amounts of floor tiles and cards to keep games interesting for many plays

It looks great and the atmosphere is definitely there. The mechanics are somewhat flawed and there are definite balance issues between the different factions. There are also numerous errors on both the cards and in the rules. This all puts a slight damper on what could have been the next Space Hulk but sadly isn't (and I'm not even a GW fan anymore).

This has been going on for like 3 years now and I still haven't gotten everything.  In fact, it looks like most stuff isn't coming out now due to a dispute between Prodos and Fox.  Boy, do I regret buying into this.

Awesome figures and good material quality. The rulebook 2.0 is still plain crap.

This is a great game that suffers from some rules faults. Easy to get around though with little fuss if everyone agrees. Really great models!

Good area impulse game.  Somewhat overlooked.

RATING: 8
The main problem was the length of the full game. This game demonstrates that the system is purely tactical, and starkly portrays the nature of the fighting. British and Commwealth forces are very finely observed, better than in any other design. Clever and seamless map, standard cheapish TAHGC production.

One of my favourite of this system which includes Turning Point: Stalingrad and Breakout:Normandy with the scale being platoon level for this battle. Some tough Maoris make an appearance near the end game.

The rule book has a suprisingly low number of pages and if you have cut your teeth on Storm over Arnhem, then it is fairly easy to get into.

RATING: 4
The second in the series I've played. The Allies have a heart-breaking climb to push the Germans out of the infamous town and it's ruined monastery in this recreation of the third of four battles waged on the site in 1943. The rules are fairly simple and straight-forward. (A big plus.) However, the counter-count is high and new players may need to break up the game into a couple sessions before they tackle it. The Allied player especially must plan his attacks and defenses wisely, because the situation and terrain favor grinding attrition. Finally, I think you have to be a real fan of the battle to put necessary heart into the game to draw out its full potential. Otherwise, the game can grow monotonous after a the first five turns or so.

RATING: 7
Very long, but a solid adaptation of the Storm over Arnhem engine; the basic system is essentially unchanged. Of the 4 area-impulse games Avalon Hill did, Storm over Arnhem and this game form one related pair, with Turning Point: Stalingrad and Breakout: Normandy being similar but substantially different games. Both have their advantages, but I admit being drawn to the more straightforward elegance of the earlier two games these days. Still, the tactics in TaC are not as intuitive as the other games, and unless you play the extended game (not very likely), the Monastery itself never comes into play. I actually like the graphics of this game, but I can see it might not appeal to some.

Very good installament in the area movement AH line of games. It&#039;s the only one with ASL like counters, the feeling is very tactical, it&#039;s an improvement over SoA and it&#039;s a very tense and good game.
Two aspects detract from it. It takes a long time to set it up and it take a lot of time to play the darn thing to conclusion (6-8 hours).

Lighter than [i]Turning Point: Stalingrad[/i], TaC is the right middle-weighted [u]area-impulse[/u] wargame to start with. It has a nice mounted mapboard showing the town and the monastery on the top of the mountain. Every move is tense allowing many tactical decisions. It's like watching a movie about the allies clearing the town, then trying to climb the Monte Cassino rocky hill and fight the monastery. The terrain elevation is a pain against the german artillery. Both players have the role of defender and attacker. Very nice features, like the terrain modifiers or the rubble effects.
Very high [color=red]solitaire[/color] suitability!

Finished first complete game.  After all that time, finished in a draw.  Don't have the motivation to continue past the turn 9 conclusion as I have other games I want to play.  Draw it is.  Pretty cool game. I'm still getting accustomed the area movement mechanics (more experience with hex games).

Don't let all those comments about the map being ugly affect you.  The map is fine. In fact, I really like the map.

It's the counters that need an update: hard to read and uninspiring.  Good colorful counters coupled with the map would make this a really good looking game on the table that is fun to interact with. Currently looking to see if I can find some miniatures that could contain the necessary information. The board and area movement would work great with miniature figures instead of the boring, hard to read counters.

3/13/08: OK, so now I have pretty much the whole area-impulse collection! Storm over Arnhem, Turning Point: Stalingrad, Breakout: Normandy, Monty's Gamble, and now this one! The graphics look like typical late 80's AH fare, which is OK. The rules seem pretty straightforward, so hopefully this one can get to the table sooner than later!

RATING: 8.5
For some reason the mapboard gets maligned in this game, 

No idea why it is beautifully illustrated and effectively captures the battle in Casino town whilst capturing the action around monastary hill and castle hill. Far superior to some of the sheer trash GMT turn out these days. 

The game is tense and IMHO is a superior game to the rest of the series. I don't mind the smaller counters as some of the areas are small and they can be easily deployed without stacking. 

Needed more scenarios but the campaign game is solid

Players play Commonwealth or Axis forces, fighting at Cassino during World War II.  The second of the Courtney Allan area movement, impulse games.  Players alternate activating areas on the map for either movement or combat.  Units which activate are considered "committed", more vulnerable, and ineffective until next turn.  Probably the cleanest, and simplest of the impulse games to pick up and play - the rules are an easy eight pages, certainly less complex than Breakout: Normandy and Turning Point: Stalingrad.  Couple of fast playing, 30 minute scenarios to teach you the basics, before the big, long slog of the campaign game.  Good game, if rather frustrating and repetitious.  Very busy map, tiny half inch counters.

I suspect that many wargamers have a particular battle that fascinates them and for me that battle is Monte Cassino.  In a grim way Thunder at Cassino really feels like that uphill struggle.  This game is an older version of the area movement system and it has simpler rules than Monty's Gamble or Breakout Normandy.  I like the clean and simple rules, for me they're about as complex as Hammer of the Scots.  You do have a lot of units and it takes a bit to set it up.  The map is great looking (in my opinion) with lots of area detail and really gives the feel of grinding it out in the town.  Instead of a few big combats like in Monty's Gamble, Thunder at Cassino has lots of small battles where one side tries to pick away at the other to prep for an advance.  The timing of when to commit units (by using them) is critical since they're weaker after being flipped.  I love the artillery rules and the use of spotters.  It's fun to be the Germans up in the monastery lobbing shells down on the town.  From what I've read I think it captures the battle very well.  Great decisions, tense and there are lots of tactical elements to discover (how to attack a space, machine guns and smoke for example).  I wish the counters were larger and clearer- the print is tiny and hard to see.  It's longish, but you won't have to refer to the rulebook as often as most wargames.  The fact that it has four scenarios is good, but only the Final Days and the big Campaign game are all that interesting.  This rating is for the Thunder at Cassino and The Final Days scenarios played separately.  The combined pair as a full campaign sounds fun but I have yet to find the time or opponent to take it on.  The Final Days scenario remains a wargaming favorite.

The second best one for area movement game, after the Stalingrad game.  This bitter struggle over the Mount Cassino between the Allied and the German is the perfect test to the game system, which had been opened since the Storm over Arnhem, which was issued quite a long ago.  I love this game's fluditiy in constant changing control of the areas between both sides and the blood-thirsty Combat Results Table. The terrain modifiers ("TEM") plus the rubble effects are also unqiue to this system and they are adapting to the situation very well.  A good game to bargain for and more applicable than Breakout Normandy.

Must be considered a disappointment coming as it did after the innovative and award-winning Storm Over Arnhem and before Turning Point:  Stalingrad when the area-impulse genre really hit its stride.  Everywhere one looks at this design there is evidence of compromise - and almost none of it good.  The map has two scales when that should have never happened.  The counters are mostly puny 1/2" things and exhibit ASL level ugliness.  The rulebook is in a tiny font as if another four pages would have broken the bank.  The prose in the rulebook borders on excruciating, making what is really a rather simple game appear much more complex than it truly is.  It also takes a long time to play.

This games weds complexity with play balance to provide an excellent addition to any serious wargamers collection. Many friends of mine, whose idea of a complex wargame is Axis and Allies, can grasp the rules here. The counters are of good design, but AH just doesn't seem to take the time to provide quality control. The same could be said of the map board, however, if you get past its 'busyness' it does accurately represent the terrain of the battle. Overall, I enjoy playing it and coming up with new strategies. It ranks relatively equal with the other area movement games. Depends on what you look for in a game.

There are a lot of very nice things about this game, which gives an excellent feel for the battle.  The machine-gun and tank rules are especially clever.  It is let down by two things: the ability to move every unit (a tactic stopped in the later games in this series) means that it is way too long; and the artillery rules are open to abuse.

RATING: 8.5
Thunder at Cassino was published by Avalon Hill in 1987 and is the second in its series of area-impulse games.  Designed by Courtney Allen the game depicts the third Allied attempt to capture the Italian town of Cassino and the mountain behind it in 1944.  This game is a really interesting design.  Building on the success of Storm Over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino added a few new rules into the mix to help the series evolve.

First it added a TEM or Terrain Effects Modifier to each of the areas to represent the defensive value of the terrain found in each.  The terrain also had elevation, which makes sense as this battle was dominated by the monastery on top of Monte Cassino.  Elevation effects ranged combat and also artillery observers on Monte Cassino and Castle Hill have an extended spotting range.

Thunder at Cassino also allows areas to develop rubble at the start of the game due to the Allied bombardment that kicked off the attack.  Rubble makes it harder to move into the area for tanks and anti-tank guns.  The game also introduces construction units who can be used to remove rubble from areas to free up movement.

Another change is that machinegun units increase the movement costs for infantry moving adjacent to them or entering the same area.  This models the power of an entrenched machinegun with good fields of fire in this type of combat and the difficulty in moving up and silencing them.  Also artillery units can place a limited amount of smoke to help units move into areas.  The Germans are severely limited in their ability to produce this smoke while the Allies are a little better. 

Finally instead of their being set night turns as in Storm Over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino allowed whoever was holding the tactical advantage to declare that the following impulses for the turn will be under night conditions.  Night conditions make moving easier, shooting harder and gives both sides a little extra to think about.

Physically the map for Thunder at Cassino is great.  It does a wonderful job of showing the town and the monastery towering above it on top of the mountain.  It helps to ram home to the Allied player just what a difficult task it is going to be.  First you have to clear the town then you have to charge up the side of a steep hill all the while trying to push back a strong and determined defence.

The counters are good and bad.  The counters in the game are teeny tiny and the matte finish makes them muddy and difficult to read at times.  But on the positive side the breakdown of the different units is impressive and helps to tell the story of the battle.  It would have been easy to have semi-generic allied units but instead there are New Zealanders, Maoris, Ghurkhas, Brits and American tanks.

In the end I thought this game played well.  It gave a good sense of the slog that the allies faced in trying to capture Cassino, while also providing both players with plenty of testing situations.  The ticking clock of the turns slowly draining away can really play on the Allied player, especially if they are a few victory points away from victory.  Thunder at Cassino is often seen as the least favourite of the Avalon Hill area-impulse series of games but I really enjoyed it and think it does a good job of portraying the challenges facing both sides in this famous battle.

RATING: 7
I like this game mainly because of the length. There's meat to it, unlike the tournament emphasis of its later brethren. I don't play tournaments so the overall experience is what interests me. As for the map, I am actually rather partial to it. Certainly it works for me, unlike the later maps. Unlike some of those who comment unfavourably on the cassino map art, I've actually seen the area during the same sort of weather and same season that the map depicts and it's not very far off at all. The mounted mapboard again is a strength in terms of value for money and long term durability unlike say MMP's MGMG map which is flimsy by comparison and unlikely to stand up to the same degree of play use that the previous games get. It's far less over-analysed and reduced to chess-like openings a game than say BKN or TP:S which is part of its appeal. Thankfully it doesn't seem to be a favourite of those types and as such would be a 1st or secoond choice at WBC for open gaming.

How many books have we all read where the quick counterattack quickly throws the original attackers back but this is poorly illustrated by most games at this scale. But the soa system and thunder in particular shows how the attackers values drop making them vulnerable to such attacks. Priceless.

At time, a breath of fresh air to the wargames. Controversial to be heavily influenced by the dice, brought the chits as an alternative but I prefer the dice.

Butt Ugly map. Nice evolution of the SOA system. Too long play time.
The worst of the 4 AH games in this series.

I like all of the area movement games from AH. This was one of the earlier ones, with simple, straightforward rules. Nice graphics and it does a great job recreating the real campaign. Good luck, Allies.

Second game after Arnhem. Topic fits as a glove in a hand for an area/impulse game. Tension, counterattacking and a perfect balance are the more remarkable caracteristics about this game. Although it comes with several scenarios, if you know the area/impulse system it is better to jump straight into the campaign. Play the first 9 turns and, at the end of it, if victory point level is less than 15, Germans win, if more than 15 Allies win, if 15 it is a draw and then Ally player decides if the game continue or stands as a draw. If he/she decides to continue (oh, please, oh, please...) game follows but then, Allied is forced to get 22 VP to win, it is a risky decision :) 

A great game, I love this system, the more I play it the more I love it.

Area/Impulse games such as this give games a very real feel to me (even if all the buildings are depicted undamaged!). My greatest concern is with the game duration being too great.

RATING: 7.5
Area-Impulse with more tactical Zugzwang than even SoA. Easier for Germans to defend the extra depth.

Similar to Storm over Arnhem, but just takes a system good for 3 hour game and makes it about 6 hour game.

RATING: 7
Others in the series are better. This is still very good though. A little more fiddly. Game really has the feeling as though one is trying to storm a mountain fortress. There's good room to try new strategies every game (especially as the allies).

RATING: 5
My first area/ impulse game.  I really like the battle, and I think the impulse system works very well at this scale but it does suffer from lack of turn ending variables of recent style games.  I also see a problem with the attack OR move style as opposed to future games which allow for both.  It can create very drawn out turns, which makes the game far too long to play.  I like the way mg's and CC are depicted though. 

Sold it.

RATING: 6
Took me awhile to really "get" the impulse system.  I like the feeling of "push" you get as the Allies press forward and the Germans react.  Typical AH mid-80's counter graphics work better than I expected here. Not too many complicated rules to look up.

This is the second game of Area-Impulse series. More tactically oriented than the latter games, it may take too long to recreate the attempt to take the Monastery.

Great game in the Storm Over Arnhem tradition. I can't seem to win though. My son keeps pounding my guys flat. I don't care which side I play, my guys are still flat... & I don't mean 'cause they're cardboard either.

Recently acquired this at a games convention. Still in shrink-wrap. Need to master the forerunner Storm over Arnhem before trying to tackle this. (Just acquired Breakout Normandy so TAC might have to wait in line for gaming time).

This game could easily be a ten if it was a bit more balanced. These four AH area movement games all had an issue with play balance. From my experience with these games I put them in the following order from best balanced to worst balanced; 
Storm Over Arnhem
Thunder At Cassino
Breakout Normandy
Turning Point: Stalingrad
Cassino is a beautiful game with one of the best maps on any game map. You could probably use it to motor around Cassino.
Anyhow it is an excellent game to play.

The best game among the same system AH games.

This game is much heavier than the recent Game Journal's similar games.  But, it was the age of heavier games.  So, this is not a defect.

The situation of mixture with city fight and summit fight is really interesting.

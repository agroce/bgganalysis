This is one of those games that I really want to love because I enjoy the theme. And the theme is well implemented (both in terms of production and play). But one gets the feeling that the Men of Action cards contribute to a very brittle play balance. Some games may find one player receiving great amounts of influence while other games can find one player with little or no opportunity to buy stills. I understand that some players say that the negotiation aspects help to play balance some of these things but that depends on the group of players and how willing they are to haggle. Which could be the game's Achilles' heel. On reflection, I'm not sure the game is balanced well for 3 players (given how few Men of Action cards come into play) and it may well improve with 4-5 players. But it's pretty long for being a "lots of luck/some skill" game (about 3.5 hours for 3 players). Update: I think there's WAY to many cards in the MoA deck. A four player game sees only 48 out of 80 cards!) Instead of providing a different feel to each game, it feels watered down. A tighter MoA deck would have produced more balance and a better feel of the theme.

It is not a bad game, but it just takes too long with 6 players for its simple mechanics. The theme is covered quite good by the cards and mechanics, which leads to many player discussions (which lead to an even longer playtime).

LIKE: A lot of negotiations in the game make the interaction interesting. Using cards for turn order is a nice touch, but some players could get a bad draw.
DISLIKE: Quite a bit of backstabbing. Easy to king-make.

OVERALL: A rough game if the deals and interactions get intense. It needs a forgiving group.

RATING: 5
Part auction, part area control, part produce/consume.  Lots of give and take.  Good amount of player interaction via negotiations and Thug cards.  I really like the Zum Kuckuck-styled muscle card distribution for bidding.  Theme is well done.

Negatives:  Terribly, terribly random.  Roll dice for production.  Low number?  You're hosed.  Roll dice for demand.  Low number when you're shipping lots?  You're hosed.  Play muscle cards for the auction.  Low numbers in the ranges?  You *might* be hosed.  There are too many ways for the randomness to bite you in the rear, and it can have a significant effect on your outcome.  Some of the cards can help mitigate the random elements, but that's only a few cards over the course of the whole game.

Also, obtaining influence to place on the speakeasies is very slow.  This means the speakeasies and control are developed veeeeeery slooooooowly over a number of rounds.  It sort of works, but it feels very restrained and incremental.

Game length can be too long.  My 5-player game ran 3+ hours.  Far too long for what this game is.

Even in view of the above negatives, an interesting game.  Not one I'm looking to play often, if at all, but there's something there.  I would play this again (mostly if others were really interested).  Probably best to play this with friends so the backstabbing becomes more... [i]pointed[/i].

If any game could make me give up train games, this is it.  The theme is way cool and certainly is not pasted.  This game has it all: negotiation, dice, whiskey, trucks with blacked-out windows, and extortion.

1. "That's cheating!"  "Ahem, we're ALL criminals."
2. "Hey! Can I buy another crate of hooch?"

Bootlegger really delivers a punch.  The theme is well presented with play that just about puts you there.  The play seems well balanced and the opportunities for bluff and deception abound.

Fairly fun, I played it with only three players though and I think it will be much better with more players. The rules were poorly written in some places. Tie breaker for controlling influence for example.

The poor quality control of the set was a bit of a disappointment too.  Lack of double influence cards and the hardly visible numbers on the trucks.  Why didn't they make the trucks different sizes to hold the max crates per truck?

All in all I think it was a fun experience and would like to try it again.

This was a present to me for Christmas 2009 from my BGG secret Santa.

An area majority game with a whole lot more. The theme of the game is perfectly represented throughout the game. The muscle cards that each player gets dealt looks like an unballanced factor. Most of the game rests on the die-rolls to produce and sell whiskey. All-in-all it's a brilliant game that I would play again.

I was drawn to Bootleggers, I'll be honest, mainly because the production values are off the chart. It really looks a million bucks with all its gangster figures and little trucks packed with whisky crates, and there's definitely something to its mash-up of Euro produce-and-sell and Ameritrash take-that gameplay. But in practice the game is actually pretty one-dimensional unless there's lots of interesting negotiation going on between players. This is my main fault with the game: it takes no responsibility for creating a great experience and makes players do all the heavy lifting to make it fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
Beautiful looking game packed with theme. Can be a bit luck dependent but it tends to even out over the course of the game. Some ambiguities in the rules but that is to be expected of an Eagle Game. I really like the negotiation and backstabbig part of the game. The wheeling, dealing and threatening is just great fun.

Vártam, hogy kipróbáljam ezt a játékot, mert a gengszteres játékokat nagy kedvelem. Nem is csalódtam a játékban! Van benne kártya és dobókocka szerencse, de mellette interakció a játékosok között, mely az üzletelésben és a szóbeli megállapodásokon igen megmutatkozik. Mindamellett, hogy tetszett a játék van egy kis aggodalmi is felé, mivel ha nem teszünk keresztbe a vezető gengszter családnak, akkor bizony el tud húzni a játék végére és esélye sem lesz senkinek visszafogni. Úgyhogy csak annak ajánlom a játékot, aki ne fél és nem sértődik meg. Ez a játék kő kemény csata az ital piacán és az nyer akinek a legtöbb pénze lesz.
A játék vége felé dobtam 11-et (5+6) Mivel a rendőrök pont nálam voltak, az ötös dobás miatt a teljes árukészletemet lefoglalták. Így mehettem oda üzletelni, ahol nem tudták autó hiányában kiszállítani az árut. A baj csak az volt, hogy a másik család is pályázott a lepárlásokra, mivel kettőt dobott két kockával. Amint mentek fel a licitek, hirtelen a másik család közölte az eladóval, hogy amennyiben nem neki adja el az árut, akkor felgyújtja az egész készletét és nem marad neki semmi. Az eladó nem sokat tudott tenni és nem nem kaptam árut abból az üzletből. Szóval kő keményen megy benne a zsarolás is :) Kipróbálnám 5-6 fővel is, hogy mekkora családi viszályok alakulnak ki.

This game reached the pinnacle of greatness when I was able to simultaneously extort a player for money and then turn around and screw him over anyway.  Bwahahaha!!  Of course, then my wife turned around and did the exact same thing to me in a later game.  Gah!  Within a few necessary guidelines, pretty much anything goes.  Use your imagination.  The more people get into this, the more fun it is.  Five and six player gaming at its finest.  Just make sure everyone is aware of the overwhelming power of a player who Controls a larger speakeasy and is getting the profit for several turns.  It's very easy for someone to run away with the game if others aren't careful.

Idea is quite simple. Brew, deliver, and sell illegal booze in the speakeasies. Not much interaction among the players though. Only played once so far and the difficult part is the limited number of influence markers. WIth limited influence markers makes for a VERY slow game. I understand why they are limited but it is tough for new players.

Veteran players of Diplomacy and Junta should like this one quite a bit. The most critical aspect of this game is deal-making and negotiation. You can't win if you are perceived as ahead in the game, so a lot of (enjoyable) effort is spent in threatening and accusing the competition. I think there is just enough luck to keep even trailing players interested and hopeful-- especially if they can convince others to pull down the leaders! Possibly Eagle's best game, rich with theme,  and a great game all on its own.

I finally got a chance to play this, though only the one time. We played a six player game, and it took a very long time. I suspect all six player games of Bootleggers will take longer than I'm interested in, but I am eager to try a four player game and test the length.

Bootleggers was fun. It had some hard decisions, some tense moments, and it encouraged a lot of player interaction and wheeling 'n' dealing. 

I'm not sure how many different strategies there are or how much replay value the game has, though. The rules were not nearly as clear as I would have liked, leading to some self-moderation.

The main concern I have is with the components. They're good quality, but there isn't nearly enough money or dice. I would have been much more excited if the truck-miniatures had actually been different sizes, with a large truck actually being bigger than a small truck, but I know that would have been expensive to produce.

I recommend the game.

Does the lush production and theme of Bootleggers leave one thinking of "Miller's Crossing", homemade hootch, tommy guns and dangerous broads--languishing under Prohibition for the return of decent Scotch?  Well, not as much as the interactions, infighting, extortion and exclamations of, "take it easy pal--it's just business," between players stokes the right atmosphere.  It could nab a higher rating from me, but frankly the fussy busywork of adjusting the dice, thugs, crates, trucks, cards, coppers and other Cagney-influenced paraphernalia feels heavy-handed.  Enlist a few good hitmen from your group to help keep things flowing smoothly.  Last played 29 Sept. '06 with Michael, Ben, Garrett and Corey.

RATING: 7
Tongue in cheek game themed around the illegal booze business during prohibition. Each "mobster" has a "still," a small truck, an influence marker (thug) and some money to start with. Each turn the players draft cards which confer additional resources or allow some kind of "take that" action. Players then place their influence markers in several "speakeasies" in order to build up a controlling interest. Then the stills produce a variable number of crates of booze (die roll) and load up their truck(s). Next, players place their trucks next to the speakeasies in order to get the best price for their product. After that, one at a time, the gin joints roll to determine how much product they will purchase from the trucks. Turn order and amount of influence in a given joint will determine who gets priority in the case of more product sitting at the loading docks than there is demand for it. Unsold crates are lost.

I enjoyed the game well enough. It has more depth than it first appears - but very subject to a host of random factors that can easily sink any plan. Players have a lot of decisions to make that can affect the play and formulating a successful strategy will take several playings to develop but then a lot of luck to execute. However, it is a bit light and too chaotic for a main game and way too long to be a filler. Not sure how often we'll see this on the table.

Our group likes it so it looks like we will be playing it. Two games per session may be done unless you have five or six players. Turn order is king and the semi-randomly distributed "muscle" cards determine the order of play (a la "El Grande"). Luck of the draw in this is a lot higher than I'd like. In El Grande at least everyone has the same set of cards to start with; I'd prefer that here. The "action card" sequencing is also very important. But, it is dripping with theme, is well produced, and easy to learn and get started on - but my enthusiasm for it is a lot less than the others in our group.
******
Another play and I'm afraid this game is falling into the "Settlers of Catan" category which is not good. I really don't like the way the muscle cards work (a poor, as it turns out, variation of the power card mechanic from El Grande), and the die rolls can really kill you. I spent nearly the whole game with one small truck that I could never fill because even with an extra die (still improvement) I was rolling a preponderance of "ones." If you are having to buy crates to fill a small truck you are hooped but good. I had a majority of influence in two speakeasies but still ended up coming last by a wide margin. There was no point in buying another truck (in fact even after finally getting a remote still I was just managing to fill the one small truck I had for the whole game.) - I had a thug card that let me save one round's worth of over-production and never used it.

An edge case? Perhaps but that's the kind of game it can be and not the kind I get any enjoyment from, especially given how long the games can last...

Expected to like this one - didn't :(

The skill : luck ratio is too great on the side of luck for the length of the game. I don't mind games with lots of luck, especially if they are short.

Hated the auction/muscle card mechanic, as the distribution of those is the first element of luck (get lower cards, you're stuffed, unless you bid high on a round where no one wants to go first anyway!), it's a total blind draw ...

Gameplay was rather boring - play a card for turn order, take a card, maybe play it, roll dice for your whiskey, maybe do some negotiation, then sell it (or not). Rinse, repeat ... no shoot outs, no real feel that you're a gangster at all, just managing money.

Can't see me playing this again - trucks were cool though, which gives it an extra point.

The "luck factor" issue will undoubtedly be one that is raised here since many, many members are dedicated Euro-gamers.  Therefore, I just wanted to weigh in on the question.  Bootleggers was intended, from the beginning, to be a blend of Euro and American design styles.  One of the biggest factors on the "American" side was including some luck in the system.  There are dice for production and consumption, to prevent players from being able to calculate exactly.  They are forced to look at the averages and then make an educated decision and take a bit of a chance.  I find this to be one of the delicious decisions in the game.  It also prevents a more experienced player from being able to dominate as readily because he or she knows the system better and has it down cold.  As in life, there are some unknowns in this game.

The Men of Action cards, and the order which they appear, also introduce a bit of luck into the game.  This means that the player must be flexible as to which strategy he or she will follow, which can change during the course of the game.  This prevents the game from becoming a repetitive exercise, and ensures that no two games play the same way.  Replayability is assured! :)

So, at the end of the day, after many, many plays of this game, I have to say that IMHO the luck elements add MUCH to the experience and do not detract from the need to play smart to win.  Asa a matter of fact, the better players still seem to win this game most often (not because they just know it better, but because they consistently make the best choices).

There's just something missing here that keeps this from being a really good game.  I think it is that the henchmen are just cute placeholders in a basic area control mechanic.  They need more to do.  Also, the production phase could use a tune-up.

Juego de mayorías y negociación ambientado en la américa en la época de la ley seca y los gánsteres. Cada jugador lleva una familia de Gangsters que destila whiskey y lo vende después en diversas tabernas. Cada taberna paga el whiskey a un precio variable. Con mayorías se puede conseguir asegurarte la venta del whiskey que produzcas , o incluso tener el control total de la taberna, con lo que te llevas comisión de todo lo que vendan el resto de los jugadores. En cada turno, se hace una puja con cartas, para determinar el orden, se genera whiskey con una tirada de dados (segun los alambiques y las mejoras que dispongas), se calcula la demanda de cada taberna (También según dados), se consiguen cartas, y se vende whiskey. 

Está muy bien. Es muy apropiado para seis jugadores. Se peuden hacer (y romper) todo tipo de tratos y acuerdos no vinculantes. Puede haber puñaladas traperas lo que asegura conflictos, polémicas y disputas quehacen que la partida sea muy entretenida. Gustó mucho cuando lo probamos, aunque según el dueño que el juego, como gusta es a seis jugadores. Con menos, no funciona igual.

Good game.  Lots of strategy and conniving against other players.  This game is mean though, and folks should now it ahead of time--stealing cards, killing off influence, getting to the speakeasies first.  Bootlegger's theme is great.  The Kickstarter was okay--on the expensive side, and it seemed like they could have done more.  Different trucks instead of one mold?  Trucks that fit the required number of crates?  Still, a good game.

Very enjoyable play action. The theme is fabulous (that's what I bought the game for) but the play is really fun, it is not very hard to ramp up, and the best is the ability to renege on promises. The game itselft plays fairly rapidly after the first game, or even the first round of the first game. Altogether - I think we are going to play this game a lot...

"I'd rather eat a bag of hair than play this game again."

May 2011:  There is nothing wrong with randomness.  In fact, a little randomness is important in most games IMO.  

The problem with Bootleggers is that everything is random -- starting with your dealt mob cards, production rolls, huge negative cards played on you, the "cop" which gives you zero income, etc.  

Not only is everything random, but all of the random elements have massive variance.  You won't earn 5 or 7 goods based on a die roll... you will earn "2 or 12".   Or "25 or 0"

The cards are also ridiculously overpowered, giving "the group" the ability to crush any player they want into submission.  The fact that you have to show everyone how much money you have all the time means that there is zero incentive to actually do well in this game.

When I played, I went from last to first, to last in the course of the game, based entirely on getting unlucky, then lucky, then crushed.    There is also no rational or strategic defense against any of the luck or player elements.

So, this is not a game I have any desire to play again.  It gets an initial rating of 3 -- probably the lowest rating I've given a game in a year.

I'm a little disappointed by this, because this is a game that I had been wanting to play for a while, and I like the freshness of the theme.

Very fiddly, and definitely best with 5 or 6 players, but the theme is immersive and the player interaction is high, even with only 3 players. There are also plenty of agonizing decisions when the Men of Action cards come up for bid and when deciding where to truck your hooch. With a full board of 5 or 6 players, diplomacy and temporary alliances can turn this into a monster of a game. Bliss.

Several have complained about the earliest edition's lack of double influence cards and short cash supply. I don't think the double influence cards add much to the play, but having the total amount of money in the economy be a limited resource is very thematic, and enhances play in my experience. If you can't pay your drivers, they just go without. If the speakeasy can't pay for the liquor they already drank, then tough! You go without.

[The rules have three different sizes of trucks: small, medium and large. Eagle had to create three different molds in order to have the different - and hard to read - size numbers on the roofs, yes? Then why didn't they just make three different molds of - gasp! - three different sized trucks? Ones that could actually hold 4, 6 or 9 cubes and are easy to tell apart at a glance....]

A very nicely themed game, but the game play just wasn't all that enthralling.  Most of the game seemed to come down to who was rolling high for production, allowing them to rake in the bucks.

Also, much of the game is negotiation, which I'm just not a fan of, so if you're into heavy negotiations, you might enjoy this a lot more than I did.  You might also like this one if a theme can really make a game for you.

It's certainly fun when you get into the theme if you don't mind a bit of luck and a little backstabbing. It seems that all you need to do is guarantee influence in one speakeasy and then let the dice do the rest. On average you should be on the make somewhere along the lines. 6 Plays.

*Plays OK with 2, if each person plays as 2 characters.

Phase based with some solid mechanics. Both strategy and luck come into play. A bit of a slow start, and as soon as you think you're getting up to speed, the game is over.

Economic, political, parliament vibe. Negotiation too. Fairly layered, but all and all pretty simple at each level.

Good theme, good art and good variety in your actions after you build things up. You can really play up the Gangster aspect, which is fun. The "men of action" cards lend to this a lot. Fairly long play time, but generally engaging throughout.

RATING: 6
Overall, a good game...I think the chief problem I have is that it's sort of like listening to Interpol...they nicked parts of Joy Division/Echo and The Bunnymen/The Smiths to create records that sound great but really are just hodge-podge pastiche of things that worked before.  Bootleggers is a "kitchen sink" game, and it shows- there's majorities, die rolling, negotiating, card drafting, blind bidding, variable turn orders, "take that" cards...there's a lot crammed into one game here and even though it plays relatively smoothly it's terribly busy.  That being said, it works and it's fun to play with people willing to bribe, cajole, wheedle, and browbeat other players.  I do like bringing American-style direct competition to Euro mechanics and I hope we'll see more of that in the future.  I'm going to come out and say it, I think Paul Niemeyer's art is _very_ poor.  It seems a lot of board gamers confuse "heavily shaded" with "great" when discussing game art.  The maximalist graphic design is terrible, and frankly I think the game looks ugly.  Just had to get that off my chest!  Another complaint- the game is markedly crippled with less than 5 players.  With 4, it has that lacking feeling that most 5 player games have when played with 3.

Played once at a time I was still learning about my preferences. Bootleggers has an exceptionally strong subject which appealed a good deal to me when I played it. Illegal distilleries, corrupt law enforcement, raw muscles, crooked unions, old lorries, speakeasies, it's all there. That sets the mood if nothing else. Unfortunately, it can't hide the fact that in order to play you need to have a very good grasp of the kind of cards in the game (not easy for first-timers) and that it is all a fairly randomised business. This is a great shame: all of the elements could easily have been cast into a more strategic game. I also remember that we had a spot of trouble with the rules as there seemed to be almost no influx of money nor men. The rating is rather low, but I wouldn't say no to a rematch given that I'm much more experienced these days.

Suprisingly good euro styled, richly themed game from Eagle games.  Rating is based upon a 4 player game.  With only 4 people, it may favor a lucky person over a good negotiator.  I was able to use a card to gain my 3 influence in one turn, and with it I was able to take control over a speakeasy early one.  After that I just continiously shipped my own product to my own speak easy and was able to reach the $100,000 goal by turn eight.  With 5 or 6 this strategy is probably impossible.  Great game, I'd love to try it with 5 or 6.

After 1 6er...The game is fun and thematic.  Great components, cool figures, trucks, and cards are high quality.   That said, I'm not sure how much strategy is in it.  Blind bidding for turn order is probably the most important decision you make.  I won the game because I got control of the "2 dice" bar early...then no more influence cards came out...so it couldn't be wrestled away from me.  I soared up to 100G and won by at least 50G by turn 7.  The thug cards have to be liberally used on the leader at all times.  Really they need to be used on anyone who has control (not majority) of a bar.  If these "bash the leader" cards are not used, I think the game can break down quickly.

Still, it is the kind of thematic game that I like and could see myself wanting to play this every once in awhile.

This game is annoying: muscle cards determine who gets the Influence cards, which determines who wins the game: There are no "catch-up" or "come back from behind" strategies, and there's only one path to victory. >:(

Have only played this game once, but it's really good - a little on the "heavy" side (i.e. long) compared to a lot of the games we've been playing recently. The theme and mechanics go together really well and it's a pretty straightforward game. I think it'd be really fun (although pretty cut-throat) if you had 6 players and all were gamers who were into it. We had a 5-player game with 2 younger kids who just didn't "get it" and weren't paying attention and it really bogged down. This isn't the type of game you're going to play all the time, but would be great if you want to sit down and have an epic battle.

Played with 6 and it took 3 1/2 hours (with rules explanations). I think this game may be best with four or five, but will need to try it. Great theme, harsh negotiations and the roll of the dice make this game very entertaining, even if it is a bit long. Very close ending.

Great game, but it does take a while to get up to speed on it.  The first two times I played it, we didn't finish because it was taking too long.  After that though, we were able to get through the games in about 90 minutes.  Best with at least 4 players.

RATING: 6
This is a fun game that has so much flavor to it. A lot of negaciations and strategic options. Also has its share of screw you opportunities. Yes there is luck but so does a game like Settlers. Overall, we found that you can manage to stay close to the top if you play well even with the luck factor. You can see your game go down the drain with a long stroke of bad rolls but this is rare. One of the good economic/negociation games I have played. And the bits are very good. EG has come forth to do the owners of the game with minor production problems (and the ARE minor) right. Based on 6 four player games. UPDATE. I had 2 other games of this with 2 different groups that were complete chaos. After all, the degree of control you have on the game seems to be less than I initially thought. Those 2 games were some of the most boring games I have ever played. I do not think this will see play again. Accordingly, I am lowering my rating from a 7 to a 6.

Theme is very interesting, I enjoy the theme a lot, although mechanics of the game needs some work.

Components are nice. Lots of dice rolling, card drafting, blind bidding, randomness. Area control game. Similar to Goldbrau, but longer.

A bit too long for it gives you in my opinion. So for that, it losses a point. Would play again, but not something I would buy.

This is not a game for the sneering Euro-Snoot crowd. So, if you prefer pasted-on theme, gripping solitaire tile laying and revel in not using dice (certainly a thing for the masses, not for you), then I'd suggest you buy a back-up copy of Puerto Rico rather than spend your $40 here. Bootleggers is a great time. It has great components, cool cards, lotsa dice, tit-for-tat aggression and tons of negotiation and broken promises.

There is a way to counter almost every assault on your gang, there are even ways to overcome bad dice rolls on your whiskey production. In short, this is a game that plays smooth and allows for recovery from bad turns and early mistakes. with 5 players it's usually close for the top three and, it's been noted here by some naysayers, all but the most stupid of players are in contention until the last turn or two.

If you have a group that easily gets into arguments over politics and alliances? Stay far away :)

2016-02-23 : It's rare to have a game where you can both plan and execute a long-term strategy and have a high level of "take that" with which you can screw up the plans of your opponents. All in a very thematic game that clips along at a nice pace. There's much to like here and not much I'd change - except I'd make talking with an Italian accent obligatory. A game that's well put together but is not to be taken too seriously.

Fun game with lots and lots of theme.  Kids love it too -- and no one is getting bumped off or anything, so it is perfectly appropriate.  (Unless you have something against hooch, I guess.)  It's fun to actually load the trucks and pull them up to the speakeasies.  One possible caveat: if you have someone who doesn't take it well when they are double-crossed or just set upon, then they had better not play this.  It can be a bit mean (hey, it's gangsters).

RATING: 3
Like everyone else who picks this game up, I was taken in by the theme which really stands out here. However, I was ultimately turned off by how long the game takes for how few real decisions there are. This game needs to either get there in half the time (say, 90 minutes) or provide more control over one's turns. The way the dice fall and the cards come out can result in de facto player elimination and a sense of futility. As one commenter put it, while some games have a pasted on theme, this game has pasted on euro aspects; they don't mitigate the randomness. The end of the game absolutely requires massive bashing of the leader, so stay in 2nd and ... you know the drill.

Some cool bits, but just didn't seem dynamic enough for me.

I've heard some people call this a "cross between American and Euro". If Knizia has "pasted-on themes", one could say that bootleggers has "pasted-on euroness". The amount of money you earn (i.e. victory points) heavily depends on the dice you throw, or whether or not you throw a 5. The little bit of strategy in the ruleset is 1) not well balanced, 2) thrown away by the powerful "take that" cards that plague the game. American games are inherently random, euro games are not. Combining both is asking for disaster.

Played something like 3 times. One time I was playing with several friends at a coffee shop when the barista told us they were closing for the night. We were so engrossed that when we had to take a picture of the board setup on somebody's cell phone, pack it up, and resume play a half hour later at my apartment. It's a good strategic game for a large group, up to 6, but what's really great about this game is that it has loads of moxie!

RATING: 5
Managing all the components is cumbersome. It is very hard for me to get the feel of this game right, to know when it is a good idea to attack others and when to sit back and be friendly; to know when to trust others to help you open a speakeasy and when to let THEM go first. It makes players want to avoid conflict sometimes, because they aren't sure of their position and what their interests are. I do not like this in a game. 

I've played the game about 10 times or so, but it was 6 years ago or more and thinking back about it I can hardly remember anything about my experience, just the fiddliness. I suspect better mafia games exist nowadays. I used to have this as a 7 but I'm moving it to a 5 here in 2013. Sold in 2016.

As mobsters during prohibition, you are producing, shipping, and selling illegal booze.  At its heart, it's an economic game with a criminal side.  First to $100,000 wins.

This game is one of my absolute favorites.  The game fits the theme very well.  Amazing bits/artwork.  Great player interaction.  It has been a hit with virtually everyone I've played it with.  The game has luck and bash-the-leader elements, but strategy is still necessary to win and the fun factor is hard to beat.  Print out the $50,000 bills (file available here at BGG) to cure the game's cash shortage.

A classic hybrid with some Euro-inspired game mechanics, an American theme, and a pretty strong 'take-that' element.

RATING: 7.25
Area influence/control, economic, with a lot of screwage, and enough luck to scare away pure euro players. To give you an idea of how swingy it can be, a player who was close to last, if not in last place, won in the last turn when he managed to hijack someone else's truck, load up on production with extra dice for his stills, and manage to ship out and supply a large demand at a large speakeasy. Oh, and while other players were bashing the one in the lead. So, a perfect storm, and this kind of development would turn off a lot of purists, no-luck players, but I enjoyed it. Loved the theme and the integration of the theme, and with a casual group speaking like Don Corleone wannabes, it was a night well spent. And this was with me getting hosed by dice three turns in a row, rolling 1s and being doomed to fail. Lots of negotiations here, lots of threats of screwage, potential for backstabbery.

Also, I appreciate that it plays up to 6, which few games do.

A theme heavy area control euro with a good dose of player interaceion and screwage. Most of these are 'sadly' missing from nearly every eurostyle game. But happily it is all in here.

The distribution of the muscle cards makes the game a bit too unfair, otherwise it's quite a fun game with a solid theme. At least with 6 players it seems to have a tendency to drag on too long.

RATING: 7.15
Rating after one play with 3 players. I feel that 4 or 5 player is ideal while 3 (too few) and 6 too much. The Bonus Cash you get when being the "Control Mobster" is too big (creates imbalances). It should not be applied to "every crate sold" just on those not sold by yourself. Also I think the trucks should have had a spot where you put in a pin in player color to mark them, sometimes you rent your truck and then trucks may be  mixed up easily.
Otherwise a solid game [i]not[/i] with usual medieval theme but some dice rolling that may screw you. But it feels not that bad so it is really an enjoyable game.

Sooooooooooooooo many dice to roll... And it drags quite a bit after the influence runs out (turn 8 or so out of 12). I suggest playing the shortened 8 turn version.

Turns out we played without an ending at a set $ ammount. This helps a LOT, turning the parts that dragged towards the end into a nice tight race.

I had been eager to give this one a try, and finally got an opportunity with 4 players. I like the game, but as many in my group said, it seemed too fiddly with all the parts and pieces to keep track of. I liked the game, but I think it would clearly be better with more people, in order to speed up the opening of bars and encourage more player interaction. Would like to try again with 5, which I suspect may be the sweet spot.

A game with Mobsters and speakeasies, how could I turn this one down?  Astonishingly easy to play with quite clever game mechanics, this one I'm going to be sharing with a lot more friends at game get-togethers.  As many have likely said though what drops the rating for me on this one are "the little things", not enough dice if playing a larger 6 player game, not enough money supplied for even really a 4 player game, and of course the clever trucks being VERY hard to read their "size numbers".  Still didn't take away from a very enjoyable game.

RATING: 5
Not really a bad game but definitely not for me. Take El Grande and add in lots of dice rolling and even more take that... and you basically get Bootleggers.

Too much dice rolling that has individual effects for a longer game (90 to 120 minutes) and too much take that for me to really pick this over anything else but again, not "bad" - just not for me.

RATING: 9
Great game.  You have to balance production, distribution, consumption, and protection in order to maximize returns.  You have to actively manage your risk because of those cards and therefore sometimes take a less profitable avenue, but a safer one.  Watch your costs!  It's just like any business.  You tend to just think of the one big pay out, but it's the costs that when the game.  Make sure your costs are tied to real assets. 

Also, keep an eye out on the global supply and demand.  Sometimes there is more booze then trucks, other times, it is the other way around.  

With regards to dealing with other player, threats are useful, sometimes productive, but best of all, free!  You would be surprized how far a subtle (or not so subtle) threat will protect you (or pay for those shining leather shoes).  However, when it comes time to use those cards, make sure it is in the name of money.  If you can find moves that will hurt someone, but at the same time find a way to strengthen yourself, even just a little, those are better move then a purely "screw you" moves.

Finally, to win, you need to control a speak-easy.  I have only played once, but I can't see wining with out the retail mark-up at some point in the game.

You make the moonshine, you deliver it to the most lucrative speak-easy joints, and make lots of money. It is quite linear in this rinse-and-repeat cycle, except there are interesting twists given by the power cards, and variable turn order from blind bidding. Gaining influence to achieve controlling interest, in order to get the highest payoff, is the intriguing part of the game. There's lots of theme, but the gameplay gets cut-and-dry after a number of plays. It's a solid '7'.

This game is awesome! I am a member of two LA Area gaming groups who enjoy a wide variety of games. This game has been a HUGE hit with almost all of the players. Enough Strategy for serious players and a lot of fun for players who like to play games rich in theme. Lots of player interaction. The wheeling and dealing that occurs during this game is one of its best features. Very under rated on BGG in my opinion.

Great game for large groups.  I've had better-than-expected success teaching the rules (I thought the influence and loading docks would be too fiddly).

That the Men-Of-Action cards are placed faced up & bid on at the beginning of each turn allows every card to be discussed.  This ensures that everyone knows how to play the cards and allows everyone to learn the cards in small increments.

Simplify the influence rules and clear up a few of the card interactions, and this is becomes a 10.

In the first game we played I missed the rule that says the game ends in the round when one player has more than $100k ... so we ended up making more paper money & playing to 12 rounds.  We also somehow allowed the negotiating & deal-making to extend into all phases of play & it ended up being about 10 times as interactive as Genoa (& that's saying alot) & 10 times as cut-throat.  

It got crazy!  One player was making an absolute pile of money from having controlling influence on a big speakeasy (~$70k per turn) but every round we would all do deals with her that would leave her with NO money just before the next pay out.  She ended up winning anyway but not by an enormous margin.  There were bidding wars, undercutting, threats, promises & whispers.  

It took a while (played this way) but it was a good experience & with the right crowd & enough energy I'd have no problem playing it every now & then.

Update: played a second game using poker chips.  Everyone wanted to ignore the $100K victory condition & instead play all 12 rounds.  The winner ended up winning by hiding $40K worth of chips so that we didn't target him as much.  Another great gaming experience.

Second update: Third game was won by a player hitting $100k exactly - they did this by paying nothing for turn order in the winning round, bribing a player to sell crates at the small bar where they had controlling majority & rolling high enough for demand that enough crates were sold.  Only those exact moves would have won the game after 9 well-played rounds.  Fantastic!  (Other scores were $95k, $94k, etc.)

Third update: This game never lets me down!  I don't usually like such free-form negotiation games but this is the one exception.

RATING: 6
Please note that this rating is based on a play with a serious rules error.  

I had fairly high expectations for this, because I am a fan of area control and it had elements that reminded me of games I like (El Grande in particular) with a fun theme plastered on top of it.  But I found that it kind of dragged on for longer than I wanted it to, and it felt a little clunky in ways I hope I'll be able to better articulate after playing it again.  

Playing with the correct rules may help too. (1 play)

My favorite 6 player game, it really does a good job of organizing parallel actions by the players to reduce down time. Early game is Production-transportation-consumption chain building. Thug cards are stockpiled until the last couple turns when the highest payoff speakeasy is opened and the mobwar breaks out. Loading up the trucks with crates is silly but fun.

This was dull.  Very dull.  I like dice as much as the next person, but the dice couldn't even save this one.

There was an area majority mechanic, but all the areas were filled up by the halfway point.  Considering we moved quickly and still took 3 hours to play a 5-player game, this was incredibly dull.  The last hour was just letting it ride.  I had very few meaningful decisions to make.

Most of the game time was just in collecting cubes, loading cubes and dumping cubes.  We used poker chips for money, but it *still* was kinda slow with all the accounting.

About the only saving grace was the theme was pretty nifty and somewhat matched the mechanics.

Edit: Scrap all that, missed the stop at $100K rule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Too much luck in the dice rolls and too few rolls to even it out.  The action cards seem too unbalanced and the auction mechanic doesn't even this out because you can't easily evaluate their worth.  The turn order is just a crap shoot and the game feels too creaky and 'american' for me as a german game fan.  It's a big step backwards IMHO, the theme is strong but I'll take german mechanics over theme any day and this game perfectly illustrates why.  I also don't like the 'take that mechanic.  Finally the game is far too long, why they couldn't have reduced the number of turns (by 50%) I don't know.  Also dice are completely unnecessary for the stills and the speakeasies should have less variation in their possible production.  Early on bad rolls here can put you out of contention.

This was a theme that cried out for a game, and the creators were up the challenge. There are a few things I house rule, such as playing to 12 turns no matter if someone reaches $100k first. Having to manage your deck of initiative cards, and paying for the privilege, is a great mechanic.

First Play: I thought the concept was an interesting one, unfortunately I wasn't as fond of the game mechanics. Most of the game is based on dice rolling. Need to know how much whiskey you produced, roll dice. Need to know how much whiskey the speakeasy you're delivering to is buying, roll the dice (and that's even if you control said speakeasy). The action cards can do anything from giving you a boost to your bid, to stealing a truck, or shutting down a speakeasy for a turn. With all of this the game would have been okay if it played in an hour but it was closer to two hours and by then any charm the game had wore off.

My rating after one play with 4 players which I really enjoyed.  The "luck factor" of the dice didn't bother me as much as say, Settlers of Catan.  I don't see the "take that" nature of the action cards really much different than how the action cards are implemented in El Grande.  You see what is out there before you play your muscle cards - and you know that if you don't grab a particular card, someone else may and use it against you.  You are in "bidding" competition with the other players to get access to these cards- you don't get them just by being lucky enough to draw it from the top of the deck like in a lot of other games.  For all the random elements in the game I thought that there were appropriate balancing factors in place.  I think some "take that" kinds of cards are needed in economic games of this nature, otherwise there is almost no way to rein in a leader.  Good medium weight game.

I knocked a point off of the rating just for how hideous this game is, and for how functional the board is in contrast with the edgy theme. Along with Antiquity, this is the ugliest game I've played.

The good: area control, auctions, resource development, the bits, the theme, wide-open negotiation possibilities.

The bad: length, the area control aspect seemed very static, innumerable fiddly rules on the action cards. 

Unfortunately the bad outweighs the good. This game should be a lot better than it really is. It needs either more development or less variables. In it's current state I'm extremely lukewarm.

Neat little game about mobsters during the prohibition era. A little fiddley with loading the boxes in the trucks but I guess that adds to the overall theme of the game. Use of the mob cards can be critical, don't want to play your big ones to soon. Once someone has control of the bigger speakeasies it's a little hard to catch up. It's a good game but as far as mob themed games go, I prefer "Blood Feud in New York". But then they are two completely different games.

Despite wanting to play this for quite a while, I was disappointed by my first playing. The game dragged on way too long, I felt many of the cards were overpowered, and I didn't like the way influence was distributed. Surprisingly though, the dice rolls weren't as bad as I imagined. The fact that you can rent trucks really saved it.

In short, this game feels like a poor man's version of El Grande.

This is a pretty cool game with a unique theme. I like the bidding for turn order mechanics and the combos you can pull off in consecutive turns with hijacking peoples trucks and taking away peoples influence in the speakeasies. If you're into the theme at all, I highly recommend it.

Slow moving game of economic build up.  Played once with some very nice people.  We were clipping along, taking our turns and talking about the game, and it seemed like we were always making progress, but then we'd somehow still be in round 4 or 5 or something.  May have enjoyed more if I hadn't been so tired.   Will probably give it another shot before I throw this into the trash.

First play through didn't go very smoothly - we ran out of some pieces and had more than we could ever use of others.  Second play went well though and I'd like to try it again.  Third play through was interesting too, but a team of two formed a strong coalition that imbalanced game-play pretty well

I love it so far, and my group had a great response as well. this will see play for a while.
I will adjust rating with more plays, which may actually go up!
Love the theme, underrepresented in gaming, imo, and the bits are, as usual and customary for Eagle, awesome.


Played again recently...and I stil like it and would play whenever asked, basically.
But the odd blend of good gamer mechanics with so much randomness and chaos that can crush your well laid out strategy could be frustrating...to some.
Get into the theme and enjoy; don't take it as seriously as it seems you should.

2017-10-21 - 3 - That was waaaaaaaaay too long. More or less you do the same thing for two hours or longer. Since the half of the game half of the cards to buy were rather useless. And if the game wants to punish your bad luck there is nothing you can do to mitigate it. I didn't like it. The negotiations, which are rather threats, where only one player benefits from them are not my cup of tea probably. And the worst thing - I was really bored. If it took something like 45 minutes it could be a nice gangster game. I guess the game got old.

This is just a fun game. Yes, there is luck involved.  Yes, it can get fiddly with all the trucks and crates.  But it's still very fun.  Lots of tough choices and some strategic options.  Good with four, but best with five or six.  "Take that" game at it's finest with a great combination of different mechanics.  Everyone (mostly non-gamers) that I have introduced this one to has enjoyed it, including my wife (gets an extra rating point for that alone...)

My first game of this was marred because I was tired and there were kids running around (not even my own). I was in no mood to learn a new game, and had trouble focusing. So, given that, it says something that by the time the game was half over, I actually knew what was going on and what I was doing, but also wasn't out of contention. Have played again in a better frame of mind, and it's still a pretty good game.

RATING: 6
Quite good.  Reasonable simulation of the bootlegging business.  Players operate stills, compete for influence with SpeakEasys, and try to make as much money as possible.  Competiton from the other players is hectic, and the G-Men and Copper can also have a big influence on things.  Minor quibble, we ran out of money in our 6-player game before we finished the game.

I thought this came pretty close to simulating gangster economics. I won the fist game I played by 4 points (out of 126) I think there needs to be a way to get gangsters into full speakeasies. We all ended up with like three useless influence markers each. The guy who got one to make up for him being in last place didn't get any benefit from it because it there was no place to put him. Maybe you could use an influence marker to attack enemy influence markers or something. Maybe it could be tied in with your muscle card or something, I dunno.

Fun Ameritrash game with a lot of theme. Seems to play better with more players. Of course with dice involved there is a fair amount of randomness/luck, but there are several things that can be done to minimize its impact. With one of the winning conditions acquiring a certain amount of $, it is essentially a race game to maximize production as quickly as possible. Some big deliveries can really add up quickly. We started playing Smugglers so we shall see which we like better.

Played once, 3 players.  Better than I expected, but a proto-typical Ameritrash game.  Not a huge fan of everything being open to negotiation, and with more people I imagine it would take forever.

It went slowly with 6 players my first play.  There's potential for enjoyment, but a game like this needs to move along.  We actually ended the game after round 6.  We also had an issue with a run away leader since people were not competing for the different speakeasies until too late.

Probably the best area control game I have ever played. El Grande is good, but is just is lacking something special. This has that something, and that something is player interaction and negotiations! Lots to wheel and deal with in this one, and plenty of screw your neighbor elements to boot. The theme is kick ass. The one small problem I would have with the game is that if you get complete control over a speakeasy you should be able to refuse to take anyone's hooch, not just those that may be at the public docks. I think that would make for a much more strategic game, and make your delivery options much more strategic and negotiation based. 

Top notch game though.

I can't tell what this game was trying to be. Ameritrash with the dice rolling and "take that" aspect of the cards? Area control with placement of The Boys? Auction game with the blind muscle bids? Whatever it's shooting for all I really felt was chaos. So much randomness involved in every aspect took away any feeling of this being a strategy game. I somehow won my first play but I don't feel like I did anything special to win, I just was the luckiest of the 4 players. Personally I see why it's being sold at 50% off at most places..

Kind of an area majority game with some negotiations. There are a lot of neat ideas in here like needing a certain amount of presence before an area becomes active. A lot of "take that" opportunities adds some conflict and if played at the right time could give you quite an edge.

The components could probably have been done better. The Police pawn seems poorly molded and is the exact same color as one of the player colors. The trucks are difficult to read the number on unless you color the raised number. Also the game comes without the double influence cards but with 2 extra single influence cards. As a result there is a small amount of component modification required to overcome these issues.

I was totally unimpressed.  The variability of the cards paired with the blind bidding system makes the game too random for me, not to mention the issue with the somewhat hidden scoring.  Our game lasted an extra turn simply because I had almost won on turn 8, but once everyone found out they targeted me and I missed a turn.  So the scores went from 92/56/53/50/26 to 111/92/71/69/36 two turns later.  Weird kingmaker stuff.  And it seems a bit long.

I've only played Bootleggers once, and that was over a year ago.  At that time I wasn't writing comments on every game I've played.  So, what I'm writing about Bootleggers now is based on vague memory.

In Bootleggers players take on the role of a mob that is competing against the other players mobs.  The game is set during the time of U.S. prohibition, and players are trying to take majority control of various speakeasies where they can then sell their liquor and make profit.

Though the theme of the game is an interesting one, I remember feeling underwhelmed by the execution.  It seems to me players' turns were very repetitive, and there were lots of restrictions on what you could do.  I came away with no particular desire to ever play it again.  I've certainly never requested it since.

Bootleggers is a fun game which theme matches the gameplay very well.  Although it has elements of a take that game there are numerous ways to reign in the leader.  The order of the Man of Action cards will completely change the game flow and decisions players make.  Like most games with diplomacy and negotiation certain people aren't the best candidates to play this.  If the player gets mad at being hosed then they should stay away.  The trucks were a bit disappointing (one size fits all and all the same color) and my copy was missing the blank event cards and the 2 other cards (which other posters have mentioned).  It is very easy to get into the mobster theme with the right group.  There was some good discussion after the first game which is always a good sign.  I look forward to my second outing.

Based on 2 and a half games.  First time through the rules weren't explained very well and it was a little chaotic.  Plus we didn't finish.  The second time I got the flavor of the game but again a person quit half-way through.

Finally played a 5 player game.  Not bad but it is a little chaotic.  Didn't have a strong sense that the best player won.  A bit too long for what it is.

Bootleggers is a fun, chaotic, area control game with some well-bracketed negotiation aspects.  There is a quite a bit of take-that in the game, but none of it feels too mean.  The game also generates a lot of potential for negotiation which remains fun rather than becoming lengthy or tedious.  The negotiation here is like in Bohnanza: there are a lot of in-game incentives to negotiate without it being overly fiddly or annoying.

Very middle-of-the-road area control. Has some influences from El Grande in the form of the order cards. The game has some negotiation and auctions, but there's absolutely nothing new about it. The best thing about this game is the quality of the components. The little gangsters and trucks are pretty cool considering when this came out, but the game leaves a lot to be desired in the fun factor department.

I think this is more American than Euro with the randomness in card draw, alcohol production and demand production.  But who cares!  This is a fun game that allows a whole lot of openess with regards to negotiation and backstabbing.  Played with the right crowd the fun steps up a gear if you have really bad impersonators or you make your own alcohol.  There are a lot of tactics that can be adopted in this game which adds to the replayability.  Well recommended.

RATING: 7
This is a good game. At first glance it appears to hinge on balancing the three links in the supply chain: production, transportation, and consumption. There is a fair bit of luck, due to the dice, but the insertion of an inter-player trading phase in the middle of every turn makes this more of a negotiation game than an economic one. And the luck just means that you will have a different situation to turn to your advantage next turn than you had last turn. Really neat.

I haven't tried it but you could use "average dice" in place of regular dice.

RATING: 6
First impression (4 players): I like how the game is very thematic. Components are overproduced really but cool. There is quite a bit of randomness because both booze production and selling involve rolling dices. You can reduce some risks by clever negotiations. If you're a smooth salesman / backstabber then you'll most likely enjoy the game since there is freeform negotations phase before selling booze to speakeasies and lots of chances for backstabbing. 

I'm not too much into a) trading/negotiation games or b) backstabbing games. Not stopping there, the Bootleggers also has powerful actions cards that bend rules. At least you can control a bit what you get and every card is visible to every player during the game so none of the cards comes totally out of blue. Still, they feel to be a bit too powerful and are the thing that'll give winning player the last blow. I never liked these "power card" games too much, either.

Overall I'm surprised I liked Bootleggers as much as I did. While it's an intensive negotiation/backstabbing experience it has a good, working theme and it's working mechanically well.

this game is a lot of fun with the right people.  though you may have to set a house rule something along the lines of "no stupid kingmaking moves at the end"

RATING: 1
Yuck!  A game that I thought I might like was quickly ruined with unbalanced card play, and a major problem with the ability to "lock out" players from a speakeasy.  Also worth mentioning is that the lack of a double influence card ensures that some speakeasys dont open at all, thanks to the lack of enough influence markers being used in the game.  If there was a "cold 10" list that was availible here on BGG, this would be #1 on that list.

[2010/01/28]

We played this with six... and we we're really excited... 
well this game was bulky, and slow
we all tried to make this work... but we just got tired of it and we gave up... 


there are way too many rounds... maybe if it was shorter it could be fun... but i won't be volunteering to play this anytime soon.


specifically: taverns take way too long to open, there a low chance of getting extra guys, the mechanics of playing muscle are cool in theory but lame in practice... and the game is much more focused on screwing your neighbor than helping yourself... i think the screwage would be cool if you didn't have only 3 guys and 1 truck of booze for the majority of the game.


Plus a theory my wife had is that if one just one person is having a really bad time (her) that it will make the game even lamer for everyone else... that's probablly true since this game needs as much help as it can get

This is really a beautiful game...my wife says the game board really captures the mood and the trucks, crates, remote stills, and backroom really bring people into the feel of the game! The rule book is over worded and a bit confusing until you play...at that point the game is simple! This game is best with as many players as you can get...then the muscle and copper really can take the most effect! 

Produce as much liquor as you can and sell it to the speakeasies during the time of prohibition! If you have the most controlling influence in a speakeasy, you could manage to earn the most dough and find yourself the winner!

This is a money-based area control game, which sounds okay at first, until you realize that it heavily features strong-arm negotiation tactics.  Generally, the player who can best extort the other players using the nasty take-that cards they've drafted will win the game.  Now, this is very thematic for a game that's centered around gangsters, but I just don't enjoy it.

Its theme is great and I wanted to like this more, however couldn't.

The board is nice with the layout and the turn orders are easy to follow.  The theme is integrated very well.  It has some dice luck, however nothing too bad.  There can be a lot of interaction.

Its main issue is the influence in the speakeasy portion of the game.  It's very slow to get influence in the joints.  Once someone has that, it's more deterministic where you're going to sell, then breaks down to a repetitive economic game.  Others had issues if they didn't have the influence in a speakeasy and couldn't overcome it, feeling even more trapped with little options.  Its other issue, when compounded with the previous one, is that it felt a lot longer than what it should take.  Our games took 2.5-3 hrs.

It failed miserably with my group, hence the trade.  Other than playing longer, my group generally fails at negotiation type of games, so there wasn't as much backstabbing.

A mobster theme is always cool and this one had the potential to be a great game.  You first make the whiskey, then load it on the trucks, ship it to the "Speakeasys" (a new word for me) and sell it for profit.  But the luck through dice-rolling and "Take That!"-kind of action cards turned me off.  It seemed kinda unbalanced with just 3 players.  I enjoyed my playing but didn't see myself playing this on a regular basis.

This game of bootleg whiskey dealing to speakeasies has been one of Tom Vasel's long-term recommendations and I can see how it suits his style of play: negotiation and bald-faced treachery - very Nothing Personal. That is, however, so far removed from my own wheelhouse, it's not even on the same river, let alone the same boat. One of the guys on the Buy It, Play It or Hate It? video review I watched to get the gist of the rules summed it up very well: mechanically sound, but not my type of game. Good production values, too, especially when the minis are painted.

RATING: 5
Seems a bit long for what it is. Maybe the shorter variant would increase the fun/hour. Plus enough decisions to make the AP players difficult.

Upon reflection, it's really the AP that drags it down. Even with folks who know how it works, the temptation to over-analyze is just too strong for them to resist.

I want to make it a 7, but it always gets dragged down.

Tried this for the first time 3 player.  The clarity of the rules was a great improvement over Eagle's norm.  One quibble with the bits is that it would have been nice of the trucks were differently sized as well as being labelled with capacity.

RATING: 5
One 6-player learning game. Too many varieties of Thug cards makes for excessively slow game play as the print is too small, not overly clear meanings. The Thug deck needs to be studied before the game can be competently played. A bit more 'take that' than I enjoy and  unbalanced card which can rule the game or, if played carelessly, can give away the game. The completely open negotiations can also slow the game as well as ruin the game with unwise deals. On top of all the player induced vagaries and slowness there are the massively important dr which introduce too much luck for a game of this length.

This rating depends on the game being significantly better with 3 or 4.

RATING: 6
Nice mix of area control, production/resource management and "take that" mechanics. Yes ultimately it is a economic game. You have to control your costs as well produce, Lots of trade offs - do you focus on transportation, production, speakeasy control....
 
Since there is a lot of in your face competition (we are mobsters after all), you need to negotiate and threaten, the cards provide a nice variation. Also like how the game is clearly delimited into early/mid/end game section where each section gets progressively more cut-throat. 
From our play controlling a speakeasy is huge - that extra profit margin is vital.

The board needs the 5 or 6 players to be competitive. With fewer I would run with one less speakeasy than players to keep the tightness.

The components, board and art on the cards are good and add to the ambiance of the theme.

RATING: 7
It's a good game, however overwhelming it seems to new players.  Once the first couple turns go by, things pick up.

Now if only there was a more brutal 'mafia' aspect, the game would be perfect.

Divertidíssimo, super interativo, no começo ele vai meio devagar devido a pouca influencia nos bares e ao pouco $$ mas lá pelo 3 - 4 ano (turno) as coisas ja estão pegando fogo pois a produção de bebidas é alto, a necessidade de caminhões para transportar as bebidas produzidas é grande,  o $$ já esta em grande quantidade e os mafiosos (jogadores, hehe) já estão familiarizados com as regras.
O sistema é super fluido sem segredos, um jogo rápido.

Ok now this game was a surprising success. The theme is wonderfully executed. The interaction between players is not only strong and very fun, it ties completely into the theme. You make threats and stab people in the back and work side deals. And best of all the game takes about 90 minutes for 5 players. I mean just a great game, love it.

RATING: 7.75
An interesting game with a light theme that works really well. There was not much backstabbing and thugging going on in our game but I can see it escalating and await more plays in anticipation of this. The game looks older than it is, like an MB or Parker game from the 90ies or 80ies, maybe that is why it has flown under the radar so far ? Good mechanics, plays quick and lots of interaction going on, deals, threates etc. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is simply not my kind of game.

I do love negotiation games, but I found the negotiation here (how much booze will I buy/sell in comparison to how much I could get by selling to bars) is to fraction-heavy for me.

I don't like games that feature decks of cards filled with take-that cards. I also don't like the opening blind auction for turn order irritating; it's just reeks of Euro.

However, lots and lots of plastic bits is always good!

If you think you'd enjoy a game where you're a Prohibition-era mobster who will happily backstab his rivals for any perceived advantage, then you'll love Bootleggers!  Cheerfully cutthroat and fully committed to its theme, Bootleggers delivers just what you'd expect when you imagine a game of 1920's criminals.  Great fun!

It felt fairly random and with limited control, but a few well-timed actions quickly turned the game.  The negotiation aspects are necessary for the game, but uneven.  Not enough control or serious decisions for a consistently interesting game.

RATING: 6
I want to rate this game even higher, but it's cutthroat nature means I probably won't get this game to the table very often with my game group.
Still, this is exactly the kind of weight I enjoy in a game. There's luck involved in your starting muscle cards, but at its heart this is a negotiation game with lots of planning. Easy to learn. Turns flow smoothly. Excellent.

RATING: 5
With six players: far too long, far too random, and far too chaotic. If you can't get control of a speakeasy you can't win; simple as that.

Fun game about making alcohol and shipping it to the various places who are opened. Opening a shop is an area influence game in itself. Better with more players. Don't let others fool you, this is a Eurogame. I can't see the American part of it, besides maybe rolling dice for production and selling. No war tactics involved, mainly just bumping off a member of the other gang or breaking their stills, so they have less production. The cop's affect is pretty much a Robber in settlers with a twist (may or may not hurt you depending on the die roll for your own production). Much better game than expected. Peaked my interest in the abstract strategy way as well as a completely involved theme which others delved right in and got into it. More than once heard "You dirty rat!" upon destruction of someone's remote still.

RATING: 6
Economic game with a splash of area control drenched in a theme that works.  Not a game for the silent analytical types, but the luck element (die rolls for supply/demand as well as card offerings) forces players to be creative to maximize their efforts each turn.  With more players (and 6 is a good number) just more time and room for such interactions.  Stills didn't produce, buy someone else's surplus crates and/or rent out your truck.  Be creative in financing, wheel and deal to make lemonade out of lemons.

Runs a bit long for the first plays as players get a feel for the game's cycles as well as the cards, but the 8 round option might be a good way to get introduced before going for the full game.

Played once, 6 players, to my surprise I came in 2nd (124 points, only 4 points behind winner with 128).

A fine change of pace, but not my preferred type of game:

Too long for the heavy randomness.

Cute components help create atmosphere, that's good, but it's really stupid that all 3 types of black plastic truck look identical except for different barely visible numerals on their cab roofs. And a hassle that they all only hold 4 cubes comfortably. Stacking 9 in the "large" truck is a balancing pain in the ass. And it's awkward having to put one of your dudes on the truck (where it falls off) or next to the truck to remember whose is whose.

Heavy negotiation, not my preferred style. (Alas, especially since moving to Poland where I don't understand the language well.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
The gameplay is married to the theme in this game, the components are the icing on the wedding cake, and it's definitely whiskey (not champagne) for the toast. Another fantastic Eagle Games production with quality bits that enhance the 'feel' of a game that moves along well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great meshing of mechanics and theme, this is basically an economic games centered around area majority and negotiation.  Options for gaining influence tokens for vying for area majority are in short supply, so there's a lot of competition for turn order to get those key influence cards and get first dibs in placing your influence in an area (the rules say there's an advantage to being later in turn order and seeing where other players put their tokens first but I don't see that, since there are limited spaces to occupy in open speakeasies).

The real fun is in the negotiation when you have surplus cargo or surplus truck space, since there's enough uncertainty in how much demand there will be that it's hard to pin down exactly how much profit someone will make out of a trade.  When you have surplus cargo, do you sell your cargo to another for a fixed price (where their profit from selling it is more uncertain) or do you try to pay someone to rent their truck for a hopefully greater profit when you sell your surplus cargo?

It does feel like gaining controlling influence in a speakeasy is super-strong and it can be pretty difficult for other players to dislodge your control, but we need to play more to learn how to limit the profit returns a player gets from controlling influence.

How can a game about making whisky be bad?  It can not.  This game is good and fun.  Better with more players.

Got in 2007

Strategy - Buy an extra still as soon as possible and a truck if you make a lot of whiskey.  Try to get majority control of a larger speak easy
early.  Use the high cards to grab the powerful cards: multiple influence, etc.

Who doesn't like a good mobster game.  This has a lot of theme if played with the right crowd.  The mechanics are sound and this is basically a tactical game.  Randomness in the die rolls and in the cards doesn't bother me as its how you react to each that will help you win.

After repeat plays, this title has made it into my "Don't get Rid of" list.   It doesn't get played a lot and its not the most mechanically sound game, but I really enjoy each play of it.

Very fun game except malicious players can target a player and pretty much wipe em out if that is all those players want to do.  This game often turns into "I'm going to lose, so I'm going to take the leader down with me."  This can be very frustrating for the player that gets targeted.

But otherwise this game is really fun if there are no malicious attacks for the sake of being malicious - so play with a good group of people.  I loved this game.  And I am usually the leader who gets targeted by bitter opponents.  Anyway, I recommend it despite the rivarly amongst opposing members of the mob.

I love the idea of grafting some pretty intense negotiation onto a medium-weight Euro-game. The downside is that the game is incredibly fiddly; cubes and money are constantly changing hands, and the cards inject enough chaos that things can be very tough to keep track of. A couple mechanics could be cut out, and this would be stronger. As it is, it'll see the table every so often, but only when there's enough time, and only with 5+ players.

美國禁酒令簡介
從1920年1月17日淩晨0時，美國憲法第18號修正案——禁酒法案（又稱“伏爾斯泰得法案”）正式生效。 根據這項法律規定，凡是製造、售賣乃至於運輸酒精含量超過0.5%以上的飲料皆屬違法。自己在家裡喝酒不算犯法，但與朋友共飲或舉行酒宴則屬違法，最高可 被罰款1000美元及監禁半年。 21歲以上的人才能買到酒，並需要出示年齡證明，而且只能到限定的地方購買。

禁酒運動將美國分成了“濕的”和“幹的”，甚至差點改變了美國的兩黨制。民主黨在禁酒問題上產生了嚴重的分歧，故而在全國的影響力及支持度大傷。禁酒党脫穎而出，成為當時全國深孚眾望、倍受擁護的黨派。
禁酒令實行後，卻沒能如預期一樣，實現美國人道德情操的淨化。市場上沒有合法的酒類出售了，秘密酒館取代了合法酒館，酒的走私活動由於獲益甚豐，日漸猖獗。 至30年代初，即美國禁酒令頒佈10年之後，許多美國人開始呼籲解除禁令。當時正值美國經濟大危機，全國上下惶惶不可終日，美國人希望飄香的美酒能緩解他 們緊張憂慮的心情，喚起他們對新生活的渴望，希望重啟的釀酒業、售酒業能刺激深陷危機中的經濟，使之早日復蘇。1932年民主黨總統候選人佛蘭克林•羅斯 福，把開放酒禁作為其競選綱領之一，獲得了美國人民的支持。1933年2月，美國國會通過第二十一條憲法修正案，該修正案也分三款，第一款規定：“美利堅 合眾國憲法修正案第十八條現予廢除。”第二款規定：“在合眾國任何州、准州或屬地內，凡違反當地法律為在當地發貨或使用而運送或輸入致醉酒類，均予以禁止。”第三款規定：“本條除非在國會將其提交各州之日起七年以內，由各州修憲會議依本憲法規定批准為憲法修正案，不得發生效力。”第二年，隨著猶他州作為 第三十六個州簽署此弛禁法案，美國的禁酒令便正式明令廢止了，曾經轟轟烈烈的禁酒運動也隨之結束。

遊戲簡介
這是繁華的20年代， 也是全美雷厲風行禁酒令的時代，非法的私酒買賣正日漸蓬勃且越來越危險，伴隨著大量的利潤和金錢的腐化誘惑，組織犯罪也隨著酒香而發展。違法飲酒的事件在 鄉村地方是禁不勝禁，而地下酒吧也隱藏在各大都市的角落裡。在Bootleggers裡,你扮演一名老闆，想要在私酒市場中闖出一片天地。雇用打手爭地 盤，賄賂警方，私運烈酒，你的唯一目標就是用一切可能的方法，不管手段是否骯髒，只要能賺到比你競爭對手更多的金錢就好。

這遊戲的做功相當之精美，卡車和人物模型都有可圈可點之處。雖然是10多年前的老遊戲，與現在的遊戲相比，卻少了不少浮華，簡單易上手的規則，讓玩家很快就能投入那個血雨腥風，弱肉強食的世界中去，強烈推薦！

RATING: 9
[7 plays] With 6, 5, 4 players. Very cut-throat, although that really can't be avoided - a good percentage of the cards are quite confrontational, and one or more of the players will be getting "take that!" cards whether they really want to be playing that role or not.

Anyway the game plays very well, has a lot of negotiation and backstabbing, and will probably make little kids cry. But for our groups, it has been a very nice fit and has more depth than it seemed at first glance. Some highbrow gamers may complain that this game is derivative, not perfectly balanced, and has some kludgy elements. What that type of person might miss out on, is that it is also full of theme and very damn fun.

[ Note to self, watch Garrett in any future negotiation game. ] In our 1st ever game of Bootleggers, he played it like a true cold mobster. I wiped out Wickam to reel in the leader, giving Garrett pure control of a speakeasy, sacrificing a valuable action I could have used for my sole benefit. I played this card purely to reel the leader and stated so to all the players present. My stated goal was to deny Wickam the right to sell at that speakeasy. Without hesitation, Garrett immediately opened negotitations with said runaway leader, allowed him to sell so Garrett could take his cut, and consequently mitigated all the damage I did to the leader - just so Garrett could selfishly take a portion of the profit for himself. A weasely play in direct defiance of my gesture to all the other players. The other players were either too complacent or too stupid to hold it against Garrett. That play was a severe momentum shift, and allowed Garrett a win without honor. The game ain't Candyland, but the gloves are off next time, pal.  :)  ]

Neat components, if a little awkward to use. Is my guy supposed to ride in the truck or run alongside of it? Either way, he falls over a lot. There's as much luck as strategy in this game, but the theme is a lot of fun, and I like the logistics of producing and and distributing moonshine. The game is best with 5-6 players who are willing to negotiate and make deals.

RATING: 5
I would not call Bootleggers a bad game, but it certainly is not a game I would play often. It takes quite long, but is not interesting enough to justify this. There is certainly a mean edge to this as you can seriously screw other players with some strong cards.

RATING: 7
A good game that might have been great with some editing.  I love the tactics, diplomacy and especially the negotiations over surplus liquor.  For me, however, there's just a couple too many features that usually require some dice-rolling.  And no, these features don't provide more character:  there's  a good theme here, but it could have been easily retained while trimming the game a bit.

RATING: 6
I don't really care for this game that much.  It can be a bit long considering it's got a signifigant runaway winner problem.  I dislike games where I have to watch a dominating player be virtually uncatchable.  Sometimes it just happens that way, but this game seems to nurture that problem.

This game, while thematic and fun, was also a bit chaotic and fiddly, too.  A helpful hint: be sure to read all of the rules beforehand when giving it a first play, especially the one where you lose all unshipped crates.

Bootleggers, we've never really spent a lot of time figuring each other out, while I've been off playing other more interesting and challenging games you've been waiting there bitter and sullen, brooding on my top shelf.  Maybe it is all your cool parts and your fancy printing but I get the impression you think you're better than those other games.  Yet, I am still not even really sure you are much of a game at all.  If we can ever bridge this growing space between us, Bootleggers, maybe we can find out what you are, if it isn't too late and you aren't put on a prize table first.

Too much of a kingmaker issue with this game. Our players have had to decide not to play cards that would improve their situation because it would decide which other player won. Sad!

I really enjoy the components and the theme of this one.  It does seem that having influence in the speakeasies is the key element to this game, but there's enough going on with bidding and production to make it interesting.  It might be a touch low at its current rating, but I'd have to play more to see if I'd recommend it.

UPDATE: It's cool and I enjoy the theme, but it is simply WAY too long for what it is, although an occasional play isn't bad.

The worst game I've played in years and ranks with my least favorite of all-time.  It looks pretty but has no soul.  Massive Fluxx-like randomness in a longer game is bad enough, but throw in cards from what should be called the "kingmaking" deck and you have a train wreck. Ugh.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game just feels like it goes nowhere.  In this game the players are each a bootlegger during prohibition making illegal whiskey to sell at speakeasys.  The more you produce the more you can sell and the more influence you have in a speakeasy the more likely they are to buy your liquor over your competitors.

My main problem with the game is how little influence it gives players to pass out.  At the start of the game each player gets one influence, at the end of 2 of the 12 rounds each player will get another (and whoever is in last place will get a second during these rounds), and there are some cards that give players influence as well.  This makes for incredibly slow progression and some of the more valuable speakeasys will never be open.

Past that though there also wasn't much to it.  It is a negotiation game so you're supposed to wheel and deal with your opponents but there wasn't a whole lot to bargain with because, like I said, there's not much to this game.  It's fine, just kind of boring.

This is what you get when combining the bad elements from eurogames and amerigames. It's got the boring repetition of the lesser euros and and huge luck and excessive play time of the not-so-good amerigames. Avoid.

RATING: 7
Bootleggers occupies a middle ground between Euros and more heavily themed American games. You do compete with rival gangs, but in more of a "who has the most points" fashion. If you really want to shoot it out with the other guys, Blood Feud in New York (also by Eagle) is a better choice. For a less aggressive, more calculating group, Bootleggers is the better choice.

This game is all about running the hooch and ending up with the most dough, see?  And what a brilliantly fun game it is!  I love the setting/theme, I love the different mechanics that come together to make the game, I love the negotiation aspect, and I love the production value (ie. the figures and the trucks!).  The game is easy to learn and each turn follows several very simple steps.  There is a nice mix of luck and strategy that will likely appeal to newer and more experienced gamers alike, and there appears to be different strategies a player could pursue on their way to earning 100Gs.  As with most Eagle games, the production value is simply over the top (although they didn't provide enough money - I recommend using poker chips, you'll need to print off paste-ups for the 2 "Double Influence" cards which were printed as "Single Influence" cards in the game, and the truck numbers are rather hard to see).  But the brilliance of the game is how the physical components and game play elements draw you right into what is a wonderfully entertaining theme (no farm building here!).  In fact, when I played this game for the first time with 3 other first-time players, it just flew by and we couldn't believe it was over already.  If that isn't the sign of a great game, I don't know what is!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Game design: 9/10

This is a pretty good game.  The theme is fun, for whatever that is worth.  I think the game has the right mix of some strategy and luck.  The only thing I don't like is that once the speakeasies are filled up with players' influence markers, there isn't much chance to change that.  Thus the early part of the game is the most critical/exciting part.  Still, can be fun with the right people.  Just don't take it too seriously.

A cool cutthroat style game that doesn't make you feel bad because the theme is solid.

Its a fun game with a solid and unique theme, but I think its a bit repetitive which means it won't come off the shelf very often.

Played this the other night, rather enjoyed it (well worth the 20 bucks a friend paid for it).  Distilled in Roaring 20's Prohibition crime, theme.  Some great little bidding mechanics at hits heart with a heavy dosage of luck.  That being said, for an eagle games game its pretty damn good.  There's lots of seedy underhanded backstabbing, rivalry, alliances at the very core of Bootleggers.  The game itself is quite amusing with the right group of people.  HOWEVER while better than alot of games the components are seriously lacking some features that would have made this game FAR better.  The Trucks could be sized as per their load making them A) Easily identifiable B) 9 load trucks don't have loose crates stacked on top and C) Numbers that are readable (and no longer necessary).  Another issue is the fact that there's CLEARLY enough money to play the game effectively. The Police pawn is blue in the same plastic as a player, it should have been black at the very least.  The does not come with nearly enough dice.  Mind you it comes with quite a TON of dice compared to most games but not even CLOSE to the amount you should have to play the game.  All things considered not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination.

I had not given this one much time until we played an absolutely nasty game of this with some friends.  It started slow and almost painfully as they learned the game.  It ended up being an almost life-like reflection of bootleggers as most of the people wanted to kill me by the end of the game.  Great fun!  The rating is based on 1 particularly nasty game that left me wanting to play this almost any time (though when is always the problem)  Very fiddly.

Fun, good for 6 players.  I find that trading tends to get a bit same-y;  if you sold whiskey last turn, you'll probably sell it this turn as well.  I don't know how the players could ever open up the largest speakeasy.  I might remedy this by either giving out influence every third round or starting every player with 2 influence markers.

One of the very few games that seems to get better with more players.  Honestly, this game plays the best with 6 people.  Moves quickly and isn't too hard to pick up.  Make sure you have some extra play money or poker chips if you play with 6 though...the game didn't come with enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is not a bad game, but I think there are some small issues with it.  For example, if a player gets a majority in a speakeasy early on, they just cash in time and time again on it, without a way to crack the advantage.  I know, I know, don't let that happen.

Played once with 6 players. Took 3 hours and 2 of the players felt like they had no idea what was going on during the whole game. The game has some good strategy, but is definitely rough around the edges. 1) Not enough money included for six players. 2) Text on Thug cards too small to read unless you are right next to it (slows down the game). 3) A pain to indicate who owns a truck. 4) Not easy to tell at a glance whose turn it is. Probably an order track would be a nice addition. 5) Having influence markers destroyed (as opposed to having them sent back to your back room) can be devastating. 6) A bit of the rich get richer going on. Otherwise, the game is very thematic and enjoyable with good player interaction.

I don't mind it, but man is it the definition of a 6 for me--almost a 5.

I loved my first play, but the subsequent two plays felt like they went on a bit long.  I keep thinking I like negotiation games, but I am coming to the realization that it feels a bit tedious.  Without the negotiation I am not sure that the game holds up. I don't know what to do with this game.  I like the theme, components and all of the other mechanics.  I just wish it it were 45 minutes instead of 90 minutes long.

Update: No more plays of this, but I have come to the realization that broad, open ended negotiation is really the problem for me. Quo Vadis is the perfect example of negotiation with rigid boundaries that I like. How do I fix this game for my style of play?

You are a bootlegger during prohibition.  Great concept, fun ideas, but not balanced worth anything.  The game feels as if they didn't play test it at all.  Just 'Hey Bob, I have this idea.'  'Great Jim, lets get the pieces together, package it, and sell it right away!'

There are too many of a type of card that you can't use often, and not enough of others that you could use frequently and make the game more fun.

UPDATE: After more than a year since playing this and hearing so many people talk highly of it and needing a game that could hold 6 players we pulled it out the other night. This game so wants to be cool it's not funny. It's close and was enjoyable but not more than a 6. The game really is about 3 rounds longer than it should be. If I ever play this game again I think we'll bring the copper out sooner and shorten the end game and see how that goes.

It is hard to imagine a game with a smaller fun factor.  I was playing a competitive second in a four-way race and would have been just as happy in dead last.  The game favors runaway leaders since the luck of the draw with muscle cards will mean that the fortunate players will get to decide who to use a dick move card on and get all of the influence markers and trucks as well.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In a six player game you get 12 "Muscle" (think Mobster) cards ranging between 1-72. It's structured so that you get a good spread with three cards from each of the low, mid-low, mid-high and high bands. So you'll never be completely screwed. You use these cards to bid on a row of action cards.

Then you build stills, roll dice to make whiskey, buy trucks and ship whiskey to speakeasies which will buy as many crates as dice pips it rolls.

You pay dearly bought influence (plastic mobster figurines) to give you majority at speakeasies. Placing influence also allows new speakeasies to open up if enough people go in together. The new speakeasies usually pay better than than the default "will always buy whiskey for $1" spot but the bigger the speakeasy the less it pays, but the more likely it is to buy as it rolls more consumption dice.

When it comes time to sell your whiskey, you load up as much will fit on your truck(s) and head to a speakeasy that's likely to buy your whiskey. Majority owner and controlling owners get first crack at selling, then anyone who has influence at the speakeasy and then the general public. But in case of multiple players in the same bracket, it's decided by the muscle card you play. Majority owner of a speakeasy not only gets first crack to sell at a speakeasy but also gets a $1 bonus for every crate sold there by any player. Money is VP's at game end. The game ends after 12 rounds or when anyone hits $100 money.

There's also a "copper" that comes out and shuts down all the whiskey production if you roll a 5. But the copper targets whoever rolled the highest sum of production dice in the previous round.

I want to like this game. And some of it I do, but it's a little too random. Admittedly, I completely misplayed the game by playing a low bid on the first round. But a huge card came out on the first round, giving one player three influence on round one. And the bid that won the card was higher than any card in my hand, so I had no shot at it.

Three influence let him take majority of a speakeasy and he only needed one other person to go in with him to get it open. This was the biggest speakeasy that could realistically be opened until at least the mid-game, so it was likely to buy more whiskey than anywhere else (rolling three consumption dice versus 1 and 2 for the other two player controlled speakeasies). Which meant that he just kept shipping to his own speakeasy for good money, and other people kept shipping there too (getting $2 instead of the default $1) which meant he kept getting the $1 per crate sold bonus for $10-$16 per turn, and was regularly getting total income of mid $20's every turn in a game that has a $100 endgame trigger. Not surprisingly he won. (Comparatively I was making about $4 a turn, and the second highest income was about $12 a turn.)

With that strong a start it would have taken everyone nobly choosing not to ship at his speakeasy (sacrificing their own income) to try and drag the game out and hope he didn't win anyway. And I don't see anyway that it could have been avoided. Sure someone else could have bid their 72 card on the first turn... but that would have just changed who got the huge advantage in the game.

And to top it all off, the first round the copper came out, I was the one who rolled highest and I rolled a five which meant I didn't produce anything that round, which also happened to be the round the game ended. So on top of the game breaking randomness of the first turn, Lady Luck decided to spit in my eye at the end of the game. Nice.

To really enjoy this game, you have to be willing to negotiate, make deals, and double-cross, not just play the cards as they come. Also, it helps to embrace the theme and do it all in cheesy mobster talk.

RATING: 7
Trade Interest: Low, since someone in our group has a copy. Liked the bits enough I wouldnt mind getting one tho.

Despite the mob theme, this is a straight up economic sim. However, I love the bits and the theme of the pieces adds a lot of enjoyment to the game. Complex enough to have enough choices to make, but not so complex to bog down the game.

Supply and demand driven by rolling six sided dice, so folks who dont like luck based games should steer clear of this one. 

I liked the fact that players only have to reveal scores twice during the game...kind of like "Mr X" surfacing in Scotland Yard. It reduces analysis paralysis by keeping scores hidden...but lets you know who is the "bad guy" too. Clever. 

Everyone in our group seemed to get into this one. I'm really hoping we can break this one out again next time we get 4-6 folks together.

In Bootleggers, players take on the role of enterprising bosses seeking to make a name for themselves in the illegal alcohol trade at the height of the 1920's prohibition era. Deceit, lies, and alliances of convenience are the norm as players attempt to control distribution through money and corruption by muscling in on the competition, paying off the local law authorities, building underground speakeasies, and shipping trucks of "hooch"!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fantastic game - I love dealmaking, and this game has it in spades.  Some might say this game is luck-driven on account of all the dice rolls, but in the end victory will go to the player who watches the market created by the other players and fills in the gaps at the right time, e.g. buying trucks when everyone else has too much production, improving your speakeasies when everyone has a good engine going, etc.  Having a silver tongue and being quick to propose deals that benefit the other player just enough will also take you a long way

I can't even begin to describe how much I love cutting deals to convince people to sell their liquor at my speakeasy

The player-driven market of production, distribution and sale almost makes this game a "Container-lite", with a theme that makes it easy to get into the action and sell to your non-gaming friends - "Hell yeah I wanna run some liquor!"

I finally got a chance to try this game thanks to Jon Wandke bringing it on his visit to Richmond.  I have been interested in this game since it's release, but it has had a mixed reception, so I resolved to try it before buying.  Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to finish before Jon had to go, but I believe I got enough of a feel for the game to rate it.

I can understand some people's issue with the luck in the game.  The demand rolls can totally cut people out of making a profit on their hooch, but at least in our game, everyone who got cut out knew they were taking a risk.  There are ways to play it safe, but obviously, they aren't as profitable.  There isn't much you can do about bad production rolls, but I don't see this as being any worse than Settlers.

The rest of the game has some luck, but it is all mitigated by the game mechanics.  The muscle cards are distributed so that everyone is guaranteed a full range of cards.  There is some luck of the draw, but you choose from face up cards and everyone is bidding for turn order with the muscle cards.  The rest of the luck comes from the actions of the other players, not a die or a card.

There is a good variety of action cards.  There is no doubt that some muscle cards are more valuable than others.  It would probably take several games to learn how to use them to the full advantage and some of them can be pretty sneaky.  It would also probably take several plays to determine if any of them are "too" powerful, but I didn't get that impression from any of the one's we saw.

The most interesting part of the game is how few ways there are to get influence markers.  Most of these come from action cards, and you only get one of those per turn.  At first, I wasn't even sure we would get enough, but this wasn't really a problem.  To me it seemed like it was always a struggle to get enough, but they were available.  The first place player was to one who was able to make the best use of his influence.  That's a good sign.

This game also has a significant "Take That" element.  The last place player was also using her influence well, but she made the "mistake" of being in front near the beginning of the game.  She became a target, and sometimes was just plain in the wrong place at the wrong time.  She was positioned well, and if we had played to the proper end of the game, I think she would have done better. 

I, on the other hand, never had much influence to spend.  Still, that didn't knock me out of the game.  I played a conservative game and was able to pick at the leftovers.  I ended up in the middle of the pack when we ended the game, but I might still have been able to turn things around to my favor.  That is also a good sign.

The game plays well and has a strong theme.  Every mechanic feels like it fits with the theme, but the game is still reasonably streamlined.  I can see how it isn't for everyone, and I probably won't rush out to buy it, but it is a fun game.  Thanks again, Jon.

P.S.  Phew...  Longest comment evar!

Randomfest which simply lasts way too long and therefore becomes boring. Strategy is virtually impossible because you'll never know what cards will show up at what moment, and besides that you might be stuck with a very weak hand of musclecards.

I almost passed on this game because I knew it was an older game and you never  hear anyone talk about it anymore.  I thought it had been replaced by some newer games.

I really, really enjoyed it though.  I'm glad I picked it up.  The play moves surprisingly quickly as most things happen synchronously.  Everyone selects their power level for the turn, each person picks a card in front of them and plays the action if one is available, and believe me everyone is glued to the table during this phase, it's when all the real action goes down.  Then everyone rolls to figure out their production output.  Then people are making deals as they assign their booze to trucks and send them out to Speakeasy's.

There's surprisingly little luck as far as cards go, everything is public knowledge, you have to decide when to pull out the big guns.  I like that a lot, there aren't any "I drew a take that card you're screwed" type of behavior going on.  People willingly pass on such cards and they're played in front of you so everyone know's who is capable of what.  The frustrating bit where there IS luck is with the production.  I don't mind it too much, but you can just have successively bad luck and it will sour the game for you.

Great incorporation of theme without feeling pasted on and loading trucks full of hooch is a blast (in the only game I know where tan cubes are thematically correct). However, it feels like the game mechanics could have used a few more months of refining before release.

Still need to look through available variants to see if there are some that clean this game up a bit.

Also, there is a lot of whining about the luck factor to the game which I felt to be undeserved. My group liked the random production, especially with the Feds going after whoever rolled the highest :D

RATING: 5
This is a game that's almost, but not quite, there.  There's a lot of promise, and there are interesting decisions to be had.  However, when it comes down to it, I think there should have been other means of determining production and demand than simply rolling six siders.  I'm a dice apologist, but it can be absolutely crushing to get low rolls, and there just aren't enough dice thrown to even out the results.  What's more, there isn't enough influence generated to make contesting the various speakeasies feasible, not that you're likely to get a chance to sell whisky there if you're the minority owner anyway.  It's a shame, because this game is SO close to great.  I'm sure that a few small house rules could make it wonderful, but the game out of the box falls juuuuust short.

Get this for the figures and add them to Spree! Or maybe not. It’s January, 1921. Prohibition has been in effect for a year, and it looks like the 18th Amendment is here to stay. The problem is, outlawing the “manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors” hasn’t done anything to reduce the demand for booze! As a result, illegal stills dot the countryside and secret (or not-so-secret!) speakeasies are popping up all over in cities large and small. Local law enforcement may look the other way (especially if they’re properly motivated) but Elliot Ness’ G-Men are harder to convince. With this much money at stake, organized crime is sure to take an interest. In Bootleggers, players take on the role of enterprising bosses seeking to make a name for themselves in the illegal alcohol trade at the height of the 1920's prohibition era. Deceit, lies, and alliances of convenience are the norm as players attempt to control distribution through money and corruption by muscling in on the competition, paying off the local law authorities, building underground speakeasies, and shipping trucks of "hooch"!

This game is part area control, part economics game, and part screw-you.  When this game is played right it seems that the most important part is the meta-game.  Being able to affect the flow of the game with threats and blackmail is totally cool.  The game also excels in allowing they players to choose a number of paths towards victory: whiskey production, truck monopoly, controlling the speak-easies, or through thug cards and extortion.  The game also does well to prevent runaway winners.

The game doesn't work well for less than 5 players.

This game has aspects of area control games, dice games, and simultaneous reveal games, with a big, heaping helping of Take That! thrown in for good measure.  The theme is nice, and the mechanisms work well in relation to the theme, but remember the Take That! stuff?  Yeah.  It sort of takes the shine off of whatever bit the game had to begin with.  I don't see myself playing that one too often.

Bootleggers is great because of the free-form negotiations that are allowed between players. Without them, the game would be fairly dry and far too random. Fortunately, the ability to buy and sell almost anything gives players the opportunity to work around poor die rolls and make the best of otherwise bad situations, really opening up the game. Anything goes when two or three gangsters are cutting a deal, so bribery, threats, extortion and even tipping off the cops all work to bring the game to life, making it much deeper than I anticipated from just reading the rulebook. It's also nice that the game rewards deceit and back-stabbing enough that everyone is willing to do it, making the inevitable betrayals much easier to swallow for everyone involved.

This game has a lot going for it -- Euro-style multiple phase per turn mechanics; lots of high quality components; a well-written, colorful, humorous, example-filled rule book that covers every rule clearly; and plenty of theme.  This is a game where you literally load a toy truck with crates of whiskey and back it up to the Speakeasy docks!  Most important, Bootleggers has more interaction than most games with almost unrestricted negotiation, and this part is key: the game promotes screwing over your opponents!  It's flat-out fun.  The only thing that keeps it from getting a 10 is the amount of randomness due to the use of dice, but I really can't come up with any improvements for this excellent game.

1st boardgame I have encountered since I played the Talisman as a kid! Look great, played great.

After buying it I found a major problem - which in my opinion kills the game. It blocks! In like 5th / 6th turn almost every place in Speakeasys is taken and you cannot do a thing about it (apart like 3-4 cards in the Man of Action deck). So you simply "collect" those extra mobsters without any way to use them :(

Still great theme.

Game is extremely true to its theme and fun to play with people who like to make threats and negotiations.

Produkcja i sprzedaż wódki w czasach prohibicji w USA. Przemyt, gangsterskie 'negocjacje', morze klimatu (i interakcji). Im więcej osób tym lepiej. Dość duża gra (przy maksymalnych 6 osobach spokojnie 2-3 godziny).

After 1 Play: Ok, so my first game of this we had one rule wrong, in that we played out all the rounds and didn't end when someone got $100k.  Still, I felt like the game was pretty dull from the get-go, despite the interesting theme.

Really want to like this more, but.. it just seems like moving stuff around more than thinking. Or maybe it's just my bad play.

you really don't want to play this one with less than 4 four players - will miss most of the fun. Otherwise very nice example of well-implemented theme.

One of the best backstabbing game!
This game is balanced because the negotiation system.
Great game if you play this with the right group.

An "El Grande" variation that is not nearly as enjoyable as "El Grande" itself.  Because of the theme, I wanted to like this game more than I did.  Alas, twas not to be.

For all of its funky action cards, the first play felt both very random and mechanical. Hopefully future plays will help draw out the theme and keep it from feeling so wash-rinse-repeat.

Really need to play again.

Whoever owns the biggest bar wins.

Bootleggers is a decent game, and not as Satanic as it's 6.66 rating suggests.

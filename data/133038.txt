I'm glad we had someone to teach us. It seemed complex and we still got rules wrong and didn't take advantage of key powers of our characters, so lost.
Having played I could see this wasn't a game I'd play solo and am already thinking I should sell or trade my copy.
I'd like to play again to work out whether this is a feasible game for my game group.

Two words: LEVELING UP! I've been looking for a game that has the feel of D&D and allows your character to continue gaining levels and magical items from game to game. Awesome!

RATING: 8
This game is fun because it takes a deck building to a new level. Your character (deck) continues to improve scenario after scenario, meaning you never start with the same old deck again! The adventures get harder too which helps keep it interesting. Great solo game. It does take a bit to setup however.

Reveal a card, then read about the check. Determine how to modify the check, then roll the die. Reveal the next card, look at the next check, roll the dice. Reveal card, roll the dice. Reveal card, roll. Reveal, roll. Reveal, roll...

Sorry, but there just isn't enough meat to it for me that I'd consider this a great game, this is just a string of dice roll after dice roll after dice roll. See, it's very repetitive. You can't come up with some imaginative ways of problem solving like in real role play, and instead are limited to overcoming the odds of the roll again and again by just a standard dice roll. I'm not that impressed by it.

Suberb game!!
Scales nicely. Played 2 player and five player. Exciting and tense. 5 player game went to the last blessing card and the team work, planning that went for the win was amazing and felt like a RPG.

Would recommend this to anyone who likes RPG's, card games computer games board games...just get it!!

Dropped to a 9 as its a bit easy.

Dropped to 7 as its getting a bit stale...shame

Raise to an 8 as its very good solo.

Interesting take on the dungeon crawl genre. It's a deck builder but one that happens in slow motion between quests.  It's basic in gameplay and the main mechanic is pushing your luck to go faster and deeper through the location decks.  It could get samey if Paizo don't publish more interesting adventures than find and kill the villain.  Overall enjoyed by the group I play it with and each quest doesn't take too long (45 minutes to an hour with 5 players) so several can completed in a session


I'm not sure about how re-playable it is but if you have a group that buy in to the loot, kill and level up serial game play it supplies it's worth a look.  Suspect we will play the campaign and enjoy the journey but it will then sit on the shelf.

Tentative review. Played the starting scenario twice, first game taught by the game owner. Game feels very random and inconsistent. Random monsters with no relation to their location and with random loot/junk. Seemingly no meaningful deckbuilding during play. Turn after turn feels empty and pointless. Fighting monsters that show up, provide no "xp", no loot of their own, and only really progressing the adventure if they're specific henchmen/villians. Love the PFRPG, but this just felt kind of flat.  Going to play through all the scenarios and advenures before final judgement.

I really enjoy this RPG lite card game.  The game rules can be obtuse though, so be prepared to make a lot of mistakes in early plays.  Once you conquer the rules though, this game can be a lot of fun, if you immerse yourself in the setting and not the mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Boring with no meaningful decisions. Most turns boil down to play card A and roll a D8, or play card B and roll a D6+2. I feel like I missed something because so many people seemed to like this. ( I didn't-- I read the rules five or six times and tried playing it more than ten games and still had the same impression.)

--I gave it away.

RATING: 10
Played opening scenario twice, 2 players and solo. Really pleased with this and looking forward tremendously to playing my way through the adventures. This is everything I hoped Mage Knight would be - a game where I loved the theme but found the rules hard work. Pathfinder has a learning curve but its nowhere as steep or long.

Been playing this now mainly as a 2 player/character game - with Merisiel and Sajan. Last episode of Burnt Offerings left to do, and Skinsaw Murders arrived today!

Really really enjoying this game - it's not without its niggles and flaws but it's so much fun, with the scenarios being quite tough to beat at times, and some losses.

Update: this is now rated a 10, having had a great evening finishing Burnt Offerings and completing the first scenario of the Skinsaw Murders, with a very nasty necromancer to boot! Great fun, which is what it's all about.

Interesting and decently fun, but I feel like I need a more dedicated group to get the full experience. Additionally, the box seems very empty for the price of the game and the fact that it doesn't have enough cards to even make all the suggested starting decks for the characters is a bit obnoxious.

RATING: 7
Bought mainly for solitaire play, and it is succeeding so far. Not my style of game at all, but it doesn't demand much thought and is engaging enough. The stories it tells aren't all that deep, but it entertains in the same manner as a Fighting Fantasy book, and the campaign mode ensures the story keeps you wanting more.

RATING: 8
Wow what a pleasant surprise! It has the deck building ideals akin to Mage Knight - but a much reduced instruction set for play. It has a huge amount of variety (even surpassing Mage Knight) in cards and situations. Each character feels very unique. The scenarios are simply stacks of self-contained cards - but its sufficient to carry a slight story along if you're willing to read the flavor text. For me, it's my newest dungeon crawler. More variety than anything I've seen before and much faster. It represents much of the mechanical interest of an RPG, but with more structure, more smarts. Really like it.

I am a cynical, selfish bastard and I can't find a single fault with this game. This game is a black eye for any multideck-driven, tactical miniatures, or roleplaying game designer working on anything else.

RATING: 6
PFACGROTRLBS is a decent game with a nice premise: bringing the RPG experience to a card game.  The game plays well mechanically and seems well designed, but it's a lighter game than I prefer with less complex decisions and less player interaction, along with a higher randomness factor.  All of these factors make it a game I'll play on occasion (at least often enough to play through the mission packs), but it's not something I would want to play every week or invest in myself.  As far as highly-expandable cooperative games with a fantasy setting go, nothing beats the Lord of the Rings Living Card Game.

This is an excellent RPG board game, and I have logged many hours with several characters in solo games.  The one complaint I have is that I cannot get too into the adventuring atmosphere of the game and it feels much more mechanical than thematic for me.  That being said, I still enjoy the game very much and am looking forward to additional adventure packs. 

6/2015 - Downgraded from a 7 to a 6.  I'm really just not interested in playing this game anymore.  Not all that many interesting choices and it feels just like I'm rolling dice for a while.

RATING: 8
An excellent card-based game that seeks to replicate RPGs.  It does so rather well, capturing many RPG flavors by its mechanics.  It does tend to boil down to dice rolling with a smidge of problem solving, but I like how it feels and works.  Sometimes I can see my cleric hefting her warhammer and wildly swinging at a gnoll to no avail.  Other times I want to weigh my dice and figure out why they hate me so.

So I love this one, even (particularly?) as a solo game.  Why not a higher rating?

(1) Very repetitious.  To me, the primary replay value is in the different character classes and that's kinda crummy.

(2) Character progression is slow.  It seems like they modeled it on RPGs, where progress and development is measured in sessions and development is *very* incremental.  This does not jibe well with the punchiness of most modern board games and you can feel the disconnect in Pathfinder.  Your character will get better, but it will take time and many adventures.

Those being said, I like this one a lot and I don't regret my purchase one bit.  I'm very glad I picked it up and I eagerly await the next adventure pack!

Uma partida solo jogando e somente uma aventura. Achei MUITO bom e desafiador, mas versão horrível da Devir atrapalha um bocado...

Merece mais partidas!

Update: decidi dar uma nova chance para este jogo e consegui outra copia através de uma troca. O jogo tem uma mecânica muito legal de evolução de personagens (também vista em outros deckbuildings, como Shadown Crossfire), mas aqui a experiência anda muito próxima do RPG de mesa, o que é legal.

Como estou atrás de um jogo com continuidade linear, acho que este aqui vai ser legal no meu grupo mais frequente, pelo menos uma vez ao mês.

A edição nacional da Devir saiu recheada de erros e alguns pacotes de aventura já foram publicados. Tomara que corrijam os erros mais crassos.

This truly captures a chunk of an RPG experience, and a satisfying and quick alternative-and it's just as fun solo as with a group! Fantastic use of the polyhedral dice, with Interesting decisions during play - clever deck manipulation, and your character truly grows and becomes more powerful the more you play! the scenarios are wonderfully replayable due to the random location deck generation - and a ton of characters that truly feel and play different changes the way you approach each scenario! Wonderful!

RATING: N/A
Have not played this much, the fact that I got a different printing of the expansions and they are DIFFERENT SIZED CARDS and are impossible to riffle shuffle. Makes me rage endlessly and not want to play even the base game.  My only way around this is to buy an entire new base set or sleeve every single dang card.  UGH.  Too salty to play this enough for a rating.

[update]
So got around to playing through the base game and the first expansion adventure set, and still not sure where to rate this, so I will still pass on that.

The game has a ton of luck in it, but it does not take that long to play, so not a huge deal, right?

Well, maybe it is the biggest deal ever.  So we were playing and in the second to last adventure I own, my friend's character dies.  We are sure the rules are just go and replay that adventure and move on.  NOPE, rules say that character is irrevocably DEAD.  Start a new fresh level 1 character.  This is the dumbest thing I have seen in a long time.  It is a coop game so we ignored that, played the adventure again and finished it up.  But now I feel like playing more would be cheating.  So I am probably done with this game.

RATING: 8.25
Incredibly fun game. SOOO much future potential. It's a game changer.

However, there are some quality and production issues as it stands right now.

Some cards have a slightly off-colored back (more green) than others cards from both the base and character add-on sets. This makes them more apparent while playing, some moreso than others. These mostly seem to come from the Burnt Offerings adventure pack (#1) included with the base set, though occasional cards in the base set also are a little off as well. It's not terribly bad (at least in mine), but it can be noticeable while playing.

Other factors in the design, appearance and text of the cards is a little amateurish compared to similar products (e.g., Warhammer Invasion, Android Netrunner, Magic the Gathering), and it's odd that conventions that are pretty much staples to card games weren't adopted in the presentation and format of cards in this one.

Finally, the rulebook is okay. Not great, but it does the trick with only some ambiguity. Could've been better presented, I feel.

I like my dungeon crawlers fast playing and simple.  Pathfinder certainly has a low rules overhead.  With up to four players it moves along reasonably quickly, without much down time.  I've played once with five and then it did seem to drag. 

Pathfinder feels closer to a role-playing game than some dungeon crawlers I prefer. There are the polyhedral dice, the division of spoils at the end of an adventure, the clear differences between character classes, and a real sense of a character progression.  Perhaps the closeness to an RPG reminds me too much of the element that's missing - the role playing.

In addition to that, there was nothing at all memorable about the three adventures I have played so far.  Not the locations, nor the monsters, nor the big bad have made much impression.  I contrast that with Dungeoneer, where each deck has its own distinctive flavour.

In addition to that, while I like the deck building element better in Pathfinder than in Mage Knight, it still feels a very un-thematic mechanic.  Let me see, I have used my mace once to hit a monster, so I won't see it again this adventure.  What?  

Production quality is good.  The artwork could have done more to evoke those senses of wonder, threat or terror.

Brilliant adventure card game with a good storyline.  You work through over 30 scenarios (split across the base game and 5 add-on decks) battling many different foes and gaining cards to upgrade your character decks as you progress.

I'm loving this game.  It plays fairly quick and I've been enjoying playing through a scenario to relax when I get home from work.

Some of the scenarios are more challenging than others depending on what characters you have chosen to play with.  There are some great synergies to be found with different combinations of characters and the game plays very well solo with a team of two.  This gives good replayability in playing through the game a few times with different combinations (more if you get the additional character pack)

A pretty ho hum game. At first I thought it was brilliant, and then I realized all the cards were essentially the same. It is just that later cards used better dice.

I wish I didn't buy the whole first season before I tried playing it.

I am not as impressed as I wanted to be and I must confess that I expected a lot more. The game works well, but there are a few things which I cannot make my peace with, especially the rewards which I cannot get so I just waste a turn doing literally nothing. For RPG players this might be a hit, but for a boardgamer such as myself, I cannot put this in the awesome category.

Brilliant game! This works well when the players work together and make use of their abilities, including a balanced party.

Pathfinder ACG is just really a sub-standard card game with a lot of fluff, but we always have a good time with it and the loot reward compulsion is strong. This game feels basically like a simple and streamlined Diablo (PC game series) experience in a box, and that's a good thing.

Playing the campaign. Liking this game more and more with each play. Great mix of co-op and individual play. Struggles are there, but it isn't overwhelming. In addition, other heroes can and must help at times. Plays in about 1 - 1.5 hours per scenario. Getting faster the more we play. I made a 24" lazy Susan (parts assembled from Home Improvement store) and we use character minis which add a nice touch. Highly recommend the lazy Susan - best addition if you are playing with a group.

Does a decent job at turning the RPG into an interesting cooperative card game. Obviously lacks a lot of the narrative elements found in an RPG but otherwise feels fairly similar. The number of different card terms is a little intimidating at first but become second nature after playing for a few minutes. Unfortunately most of the game is without challenge and things become routine very quickly. The only real challenge comes along when attempting to close a location that requires a check that the current characters can only make on a long shot. Sold at FallCon 2015 auction.

A role-playing game cunningly disguising itself as a card game. We play our copy at home and play another campaign with our gaming group. We cannot get enough of this game. And while it doesn't make us want to play the actual RPG (too many rules) it has gotten us into reading the novels. Cannot wait for the rest of Rise of the Rune Lords then after that is Skulls and Shackles. This is the top notch of games in the business. If you haven't gotten it then you need to.

Has the same problem as many co-op games, where 
1. The most experienced player can just tell everyone else what to do to win.
and
2. There's usually a "best" thing to do, and once you figure out how to play there's not much of a game left since there are few tough decisions.

In fact you can basically just copy and paste my Zombicide review here.

Supposedly future adventure packs will make the game more varied and interesting, but I didn't really enjoy myself enough playing the base game to want to give them more money.


Also important to note is that this basically just simulates the fighting portion of a tabletop RPG (my least favorite part) and has very little actual role playing (my favorite part). Your own opinions of those two aspects of tabletop gaming will likely greatly determine how much you enjoy Pathfinder.

PROS:
-Can be played solo or up to 4 players (6 with the Character Add On expansion) scaling well in difficulty (actually it gets more difficult the more players you add - hint for whoever consider this an "easy" game)
-Unique and satisfactory combination of deck building, deck managing, and dungeon-crawling RPG-like experience
-Innovative way of playing cards: some are just revealed to generate an effect, others are displayed in front of you for the turn, others put back in the deck, others get discarded, or combinations of those effects. Simple and elegant without unnecessary complexity
-Brilliant characters with different mechanics each, but all of them viable, fun to play, and balanced. Smartly captures the approximate mechanics/feeling of each class from the RPG game
-Character progression works really well, you will feel attached to your character and the threat of perma-death will add nicely to the tension (I rather loss a scenario than see my rogue die!)
-Many decisions to take, strategy is important (especially on how you build your character and your party)
-Great artwork
-Expandable and very replayable
-Rules are not actually complicated. Easy to learn
-The base box has room for every card in all expansions (note: except if you sleeve them...)
-Developers are very responsive and participative, gathering feedback from the community and implementing changes accordingly
-Official online PDF version of the character sheets available if you do not want to write on your cards

CONS:
-Luck can affect some games: as you are always time-limited to 30 turns, if you happen to draw all the big baddies first, that particular scenario will be much easier to complete (this is partially mitigated by the fact you are playing a whole campaign of 30+ scenarios).
-For die-hard RPG players some mechanics will be painful to swallow (why is the party throwing away all the items they do not want to use instead of storing them in a nice chest for future adventures? :D)
-The manual needed to be corrected to clarify many rules and mechanics - free online PDF file available
-Many cards needed to be officially FAQ'ed. Although few errata are noticeable at first and none is game-breaking, once you realize so many cards needed corrections you start to wonder if the unusual card you just encounter is phrased correctly and you feel the urge to check the official FAQ again just to be sure (which can be distracting)
-More than one dice set should have been included. Almost every turn you roll more than one die of a specific type, as a lot of the card effects are something like "add one extra die of the same type to this roll"

My favorite single player game.  Sure, high luck, but it blends simple legacy elements with high replay-ability.  Stronger if you know the Pathfinder story, which I do.

I was hesitant to check this out for some time, but ultimately relented since I have friends that might enjoy it. A faithful translation of the original Pathfinder RPG Adventure Path into a card game of exploring, and close enough in that it still uses dice mechanics, skills/feats, just in a way pertaining to advancing the scenarios and characters. You get plenty in the base box for a few adventures, and the insert comes with space for the Add-On packs and additional packs in that Adventure Path. Plays smoothly and the fact it has a solo option makes it fairly attractive for those nights you can't get an RPG session together.

2/1/15: Merisiel is my favorite character so far.  Does well on her own and her dexterity with ranged weapons makes her pretty good.  

The change in colors on the card backs between editions is very noticeable.  Unfortunately this requires sleeving the cards with opaque backs, I'm not going to bother doing that, but it's something that I notice every time I shuffle and deal cards.

1/15/15: We'll see how well it holds up to repeated playings, and whether or not every playing starts to feel the same, which is hard to avoid without a DM.  To me it's light years beyond Thunderstone.  It does a very good job of encompassing a D&D 3.5 (Pathfinder) adventure in a card game.  The adventures allow you to accumulate equipment and experience, advancing your character.

For me it fulfills it does a good job of fulfilling the dungeon crawl game much better than some other alternatives.  I was never attracted to Castles of Ravenloft because they were too simple and too abstracted.

Rating would be 1 higher if there weren't erata.  Hopefully the next printing will clear up some rules questions and card errors.

6 is the maximum number of people, and while I'll recommend it with 6, there is noticeable downtime between turns.  Our first adventures took about 90 minutes each with 6 players.

Includes the Burnt Offerings Adventure Deck - (#1)

RATING: 5
Abstract RPG for folks. Finished buying the set before playing. 

Rulebook is self contradictory while designer haughtily claims it to be otherwise. 

Game itself is ok for one or two games. After that, you're getting identical experiences with cookie cutter text changes. The singular mechanism becomes tedious and constraining. The longer you play, the more lifeless the experience becomes.

Pretty good little co-op game. I think this wins for me because it is less of a co-op, and more of an RPG, with cards instead of character sheets - and it works. I love that there's "perma death" and it seems like the different characters have different feels to them.

Now, that said, it's a _LITTLE_ bit on the solitaire side of things, but that might not necessarily be a bad thing. I could see actually picking this game up just for that reason. It's fun in the times where your team mates have to jump in to help you out, but it seems like that's very rare - and there's quite a bit of downtime between turns.

I like the art in this game - quite a bit. So that's a big positive for it. It looks like they just ripped images from my old D&D 3rd edition book. 

I do have two complaints - well, one, and a minor nitpick. First, the nitpick: I think this game doesn't need the different sized dice, and it really slows the game down. I feel like you could either eliminate dice entirely from the game with another "fate deck" that your character has to build up personally, (or that your whole party could maintain and draw from... which would make it less solitaire-like) or just do it with multiples of D6. ... screw that, I want the fate deck. That sounds really cool.

Second, my actual complaint is that a lot of the cards feel very same-y. The enemies are generally just "roll over this, and you don't take damage." I want to WIN things from the enemies. I want to sell my old equipment and gold, and be able to purchase new cards in between missions... 

So my overall take is: the game is good, but it doesn't quite go far enough.

Ok,  finalizing my opinion after playing a bunch of solo games:  great game.  Probably my favorite game that I own edging out netrunner and 7 wonders (well maybe not edge out Robinson Crusoe for me... but maybe...), solo is a blast, and I cannot wait until I get my kids and wife into the mix

Some games I worry about the time money investment with, this is worth every penny i have and Will sink into it.  Is it for everyone? well  my wife wishes the art was more 'friendly' (i differ in this opinion, but i do realize NONE of the characters are smiling, they are all grim faced and out to save the world one goblin at a time.) Also she wants it to be more 'pretty' and I sorta concur...  the spells have nice art, but weapons and items are meh.  but aesthetics are beholder driven, so aside form that this game is a favorite and will not stay for long on the shelf of many games, but rather live in a perpetual state of being played. 

I downgraded my rating slightly.  The lack of story conclusion in each scenario is starting to bug me,  my kids LOVE the game.  so still two huge thumbs up.  but for me I feel less compelled to play.

Loving this game so far.  More than 8 hours played this weekend.  Really enjoy the subtle increase in power that comes through playing.  Feels like an "old-school" RPG in that the power doesn't come too quickly, but it gets there.  

Also find the deck building piece to be fantastic.  Looking forward to many more plays!

RATING: 4
Huge collection of cards.  I can see an appeal similar to D&D and the game expertly introduced by the owner.  Co-operative nature of the game not my favourite mechanic for boardgames and one die roll every twenty minutes or so not the best return for time spent in limited time frame with much competition for table time.  Still feel the angst of the owner who unintentionally shuffled his character deck back into box after five games of development.

Előrebocsátom, hogy sosem szerepjátékoztam, így semmi viszonyítási alapom nincsen. Nem tudom, hogy a Pathfinder szerepjátéknak mennyire tipikus és mennyire jó, én társasjátékosként (és társasjátékként) tudom csak értékelni. Lehet, hogy ami nekem új, az egy szerepjátékosnak evidens, de ez van:)...

Először is adódik a kérdés, hogy miért vettem meg? Nagyon szerettem volna egy ilyesmi hangulatú játékot, amit lehet szólóban is játszani. Kipróbáltam, hogy mennyire működik, de egyelőre csak a legkönnyebb küldetésen vagyok túl. Ennyi alapján nehéz véleményezni, hiszen ha végig akarok menni minden küldetésen, tisztán 1 hétig játszhatnám, ez még csak amolyan bevezető volt. Mégis van pár dolog, ami máris kiderült.

Az első, ami már a kibontáskor is látszott, hogy nagyon igényes a játék. A doboz szép, tágas, a kártyák grafikája pedig sokkal közelebb áll hozzám, mint mondjuk a Sentinel of Multivers-beli rajzok. Egy kicsit csalódás volt, hogy nincs tábla, de végül is nincs rá szükség. Tulajdonképpen a játék "csak" egy nagy rakás kártya. A sok angol szöveg ellenére sem vészes a nyelvfüggőség, a különböző típusú próbák köré van felfűzve a legtöbb kártya szövege.
A doboz kialakítás nagyon professzionális, még a kiegek dobozainak is van hely, úgy van kialakítva, hogy 6 kieg elférjen mindenestől. A baj csak az, hogy kártyavédővel nem kalkuláltak. Bugyistól max 2 kiegnek van hely. Ezt leszámítva nagyon tetszik ez a fajta tárolás (fajtánként külön fakkban a kártyák), de szükség is van rá a játék mechanikája miatt. A kiegek vásárlására nem csak az ösztönöz, hogy előre meg van a helyük a dobozban, hanem az alapkoncepció is, ami azért kicsit szemtelenség, de őket is meg lehet érteni:) Ha valaki csak egy küldetést csinálna meg, megteheti, van az alap pakliban is néhány. Ha valaki komplett kalandot akar (Meghatározott küldetések sorozata), annak sincs akadálya, de ha valaki a teljes Pathfinder kalandsorozatot végig akarja csinálni, akkor szép sorban meg kell vennie a kiegeket, amiknek a terep amúgy is elő van készítve:) Lenyúlás felsőfokon. De legalább igényesen csinálják.
Egy kicsit a játék működéséről: a játékmotor tetszik, különböző helyszíneken próbáljuk elkapni a gonosz(oka)t, lezárni előle(lük) a helyszíneket, megpróbálhatunk összedolgozni ha többen vagyunk egy helyen, találhatunk tárgyakat, stb. Valaki azt mondta, neki az nem tetszik benne, hogy nem adja vissza a kalandozás érzést, hanem csak kockamenedzselés. Ez egy kicsit tényleg így van, minden lap amit meg akarunk szerezni, vagy amit le kell győznünk, különféle próbák elé állít minket, amiknek a fő eleme a szereplőnk személyére szabott kockadobás, bár ezt kártyákkal módosíthatjuk.  És ha már a szereplőknél tartunk: nagyon jól ki van dolgozva a karakter-fejlődés! Külön lapon célszerű vezetni (netről letölthető, ha nem akarja valaki a gyárit firkálni), hogy karakterünk melyik képessége épp milyen szinten áll, a próbák során milyen kockamódosítókat kap, mennyi a kézlimitje, hány tárgya, fegyvere, stb. lehet a pakliban, stb. A karakter fejlődéséhez küldetéseket kell teljesíteni, kb. egy küldetés tekinthető egy játéknak, ha társasjátékos aggyal közelítem meg:) Küldetés végén a karakterünk pakliját aktualizálni kell, és ha nem akarjuk rögtön folytatni, el lehet tenni egyben a paklit(külön erre a célra is vannak fakkok:)), vagy akár helyére is lehet tenni minden kártyát, a lapon is nyilván lehet tartani, hogy miből áll a paklink, és melyik küldetésnél tartottunk, bármikor rekonstruálható az állás. Ha több küldetéssorozaton is átrágjuk magunkat, és karakterünk elér egy bizonyos fejlettségi szintre, akkor el kell döntenünk, hogy milyen irányba fejlődjön: 2 féle út közül választhatunk, ezek lényegesen eltérőek, a döntésünktől függően teljesen más jellegű képességeket fejleszthetünk a későbbiek során.
A küldetésekhez több helyszín van rendelve, minden helyszínnek külön paklija van. A gonoszok pontos helye meglepi:) Így lehet hogy végigkutatunk egy helyszínt, elmegy vele a fél játék, de nincs ott akit keresünk. A játék legnagyobb erőssége szerintem a nagyon sokféle lap! Persze lehet azon vitatkozni, hogy mennyire ad ez valódi változatosságot, de nekem az egy próbajáték alapján úgy tűnt, végtelenek a lehetőségek. A szabály megengedi saját küldetések, saját karakterek kitalálását. A sokféle helyszín mindegyike más-más keret-lehetőségeket ad, rengeteg féle gonosz, szövetséges, tárgy, fegyver stb. van már az alap pakliban is.

Mivel a karakterem épp csak beleszagolt ebbe a világba, és még semmit se fejlődött, annyit mondhatok csak, hogy az első benyomás nagyon jó, de nem tudom eldönteni, hogy elég jó-e a játék ahhoz, hogy beszippantson:) Adok rá egy biztató pontszámot, tekintettel arra, hogy ebben a kategóriában nem ismerek mást.
Jó lenne kipróbálni gyakorlott szerepjátékossal is, de az úgy már más jellegű (esetleg egész napos) időráfordítást jelentene. Így hogy egyedül játszom, simán mehet egy küldetés lefekvés előtt:) A játék egy hibája talán, hogy az előkészület kicsit hosszú, de szerintem bele lehet jönni.
Először féltem, hogy nehéz lesz nyilvántartani a sok dolgot a karakteremmel kapcsolatban, de annyira lassúnak ígérkezik a fejlődés, hogy ezzel nem lesz gond.
Még egy dolog: ikonrendszer, kártyán lévő jelölések, stb. nagyon egyértelműek, korrektek.

I couldn't resist buying the overhyped card game of the year. And I am quite glad I bought it...

The gameplay in Pathfinder is very streamlined: you go (or stay) to a location, flip the first card of the location deck and roll dice (to acquire it if it's a boon, to defeat/avoid it if it's a bane).

The things that distinguish the game are two:
1. Your character is a deck of cards, and it is permanently modified after each scenario, with the loot you find during the adventures.
2. The gameplay is very thematic, with the descriptions on the cards, and the whole adventure path / adventure / scenario tree contributing to a very enjoyable experience.

The overall comment is: the game is very light and luck-driven, but is also quite fun and compelling. It's not a game for everyone, but it's a game my s.o. and me will gladly enjoy for lighter non-thinky nights!

I love what Pathfinder ACG is trying to do; getting an RPG experience from a card game is a dream come true for many gamers. It's a tall order -- and no, this is not equivalent to a tabletop RPG -- but it is a really fun game that allows you to make checks rolling dice, progress your character through a story arc, and customize their growth over time. [b]Rise of the Runelords[/b] is the place to start if you're interested in this system, offering a pure RPG fantasy theme and the most straight-forward ruleset amongst the various versions. If you like the game, it's very easy to create your own experience by mixing and matching characters, locations, enemies and items of your choosing, even grabbing from the other versions and numerous expansions. Lots of fun with great replayability; this one's a keeper!

Initial Impression: This cooperative card/dungeon crawl game seems to shine best when played with character progression. Without the emotional investment in the characters and their development, the game seems repetitive and one dimensional. The game's mechanisms are simple to grasp and playtime doesn't seem too long.

01/14 - Wow. This game is amazing. Aaron introduced it to me in October, I think, and I've played it 54 times since then. I LOVE the character customization, the fact that from box 3 - 6, you banish cards to increase difficulty/probability of getting better cards...I just can't get enough of this game. Thanks for the player mats, Dave - They add a lot!

After playing base set and pack 1: A masterpiece. Very entertaining and addicting. This will be the first game where I think about developing my character without playing.

A fantastic game design. Simply an amazing game and my best purchase 2013...yet. The rules are well written but they had released an updated version where they gave more detailed descriptions.

Cannot wait to play the next scenarios.

Nonetheless: It takes too long since new adventures come out...


EDIT after finishing pack 2 and starting pack 3: Rating down to 7. (I do not do that that often...)

The game becomes grindy. The card packs are not that exciting. Not that many strong enemies, not that great rewards. So the game becomas a duty and you hope to get one of the few better cards. It is not a game system problem, but the card packs have to be better.

EDIT 2: The rating is dropping further. When cards do not offer more the whole lack of game design becomes obvious. There is nothing going on in this game. No decisions, no real cooperation and it all about flipping cards. That would be OK if the cards would be cool. But the packs are very, very boring.

I lost almost any will to play it again.

The basic idea after all is good but the card design is not. This is where the game lacks...and it is a card game.

The flavor of a role playing game without all of that awkward role playing. Great for me because I love to chuck dice and develop my character, but I'm not super into the immersive role playing experience. Well developed mechanics capture the essence of dungeon crawling in a time-compact package.

The main game consists of playing the odds, which is no bad thing in itself, just quite repetitive.

For me the theme didn't really come through because the locations are populated with a randomiser. This means that you can find a demon, a wild animal and member of the thief-brotherhood at the very same barn – a very mixed and inconsistent group :(

But the main drawback for me is the multiple cards that all tweak the rules a bit (the scenario card, the location card, the character abilities). It's not that easy to get into it and get a steady flow of gameplay. Too often I had to check and re-read the same cards and on occasion even search for a bit of information I knew I read somewhere but just couldn't find right now...

With multiple plays it may become easier and thus better, but it's not my game so I'm not sure I will really get familiar with it.

I used to be a huge fan of this game, but I'm realizing there's just something missing here.  Probably a cash mechanic.  Also your characters seem to start out underpowered, and then quickly become ridiculously overpowered, to the point that you can complete an entire adventure deck with no real challenge.  On top of that, I don't really enjoy the demons, demons, and more demons theme that is prevalent throughout this franchise.  Fired by Legends Untold.

Sigh.. I really wanted to like this game. After glowing "reviews" from the Plaid Hat crew and Rodney Smith, i quickly snatched this up and played through an adventure or two. 

Well, i didn't like it. Set up time was long, gameplay was decent but not fantastic, and the building of my character between scenarios was aight. To be honest, the "aight" part was the most fun part for me, which doesn't say much for the rest of the game. 

When it was time to add another game to my collection, i had to get rid of another. Looking at my shelf, i knew there was one game i was certainly not going to play again. 

So long, Pathfinder. I shall meet you in your novels, where i'm gripped with excitement.

My 1st big turkey. I loved this game when it came out, and ranked it among my top 3. Now it's just "meh", here are the reasons why.

1) Early on, it's great to find and acquire new and very useful cards. By the 4th expansion, there was almost nothing good to find. Marginal improvements at best. The game stopped scaling, except for the difficulty of checks.

2) The theme is mild at best, and there is no meaty storytelling in between quests. So it turned into "flip a card, and see how high you need to roll"

3) It seemed like they were trying to hard to come up with new and different checks, and many of the newer banes checks were a bit too obscure.

4) The news that the characters were done after the 6th expansion, took the wind out of my sales for building them up for a new adventure.

5) I lost excitement waiting for new expansions to be released. Not a specific complaint to this game, but I saw no need to play a campaign twice. So it was 5 and done for 2 months.

6) I played some dungeon crawlish games(Descent, M&M, & Claustrophobia) which made me realize that this game was missing too much theme, story, and depth for me.

7) After 1-6, the game stopped being fun, and became frustrating & monotonous.

Roleplaying game with cards, simple as that. This brings me back to my geeky youth playing 1st ed. AD&D for 24 hours at a time. There is so much to love about this game. The "leveling" up abilities (adding cards to decks, special powers for each character, etc.), the different feel for each adventure as well as for each location. I will stick with the Rise of the Runelords game and probably hold off on the pirate version. Solitaire greatness, will always be a 10 for me.
edit: guess it won't always be a 10. I lowered my score after I finished the campaign because in all honesty, this just became too easy. The cards you get for your heroes get much better than the increase in difficulty of the enemies. Or at least, that's what happened to me. I see the appeal of this system though and might pick up the Mummy set at some point. But for this, trade pile.

The game is one of the most addictive games in my collection.  I play the game solo only.  I play two different characters through the missions.  It really is fun, but it will be necessary to keep on buying expansions to keep the game fun. I purchased two expansions so far, and I may stop there.  It is a money sucker like no other, and that does not work for me.  I have put some money into expansions for Lord of the Rings: the Card Game and Android Netrunner, but it is not absolutely necessary to keep on dumping money into these games to keep them fun.  With the expansions I have for these two games, I can stop at any time and have a game that I will play for many years to come.  With Pathfinder, the card game, the expansions are necessary to keep the game alive.  This is a negative point for me.  

In my opinion, the game hits hard at first, and then becomes less and less fun to play.  This one has a shelf life for me.

Only played solo so far, but I like what I see. A lot. It gives the feeling of something like Runebound, but plays much quicker. I just hope I can find the players for it, as the game really is meant for campaign play and needs players that are willing to stick with the game for several sessions.

For me the best way to describe this game is, Talisman: The Co-op game.  I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with PACG.  It does seem to generate plenty of conflicting reviews.  It's not an RPG and the people that are expecting it to be are the ones who end up the most disappointed.  Or at least it seems that way.  The game does generate plenty of stories if you let it...however if you need little FFG-esque flavor texts and story blurbs on every card then you're going to be upset.  The game is about letting the players tell the story.  It merely sets up the skeletal framework of an adventure.  The rest is up to you and your friends.  Overall, this is an excellent co-op card game with lots of replay value.  People with zero imagination should avoid.

My kids and I have played this more than any other game in 2013.  Perfect intro to persistent, RPG-ish character development....

...that gets fairly repetitive and boring after 3-4 adventure decks are complete.  It's a nice idea, but the scenarios are too alike (find and corner the villian) and when every encounter boils down to "roll a die and get this number", it gets old quickly.  

Completed through Adventure Deck 4, and I cannot bring myself to pay money for 5 and 6.

RATING: N/A
2013, fully co-operative, experience game; essentially an RPG without the RP. Very repetitive game with some character level-up but only if you play a campaign game (i.e., multiple plays). Not much variation or cool stuff to find, just an extra +1 to die rolls for "awesome" items. The worst thing is replayability which is pretty low. It is just too samey except for all of the die rolls, and it's an infuriating search for the bad guy before the time clock (30 card blessing deck runs out). In the end, the campaign game and level-up (Risk-Legacy style) can be fun/interesting/addictive, but it's just a crafty way of getting you to spend money on expansion packs (due out every 2 months or so). Bottom line: AVOID unless you want to play campaign and burn cash on expansions.  StormKnight's 9/27/2013 review summarizes the game (and flaws) nicely.

Others say: too easy (win ~90% of time) with 4p or less, but gets harder if you buy the expansion to go to 6p.

Played many many more times but I've only just got into recording plays on BGG.

I'm playing this solo and I'm just hitting the penultimate deck. I have to say that it's rare that I get so into a game that I play it day after day. To be fair I think I am finally coming down but have really enjoyed most of the experience, especially the first couple of decks.

I originally thought it wouldn't suit the rest of the guys but I can see my wife and a friend or two enjoying it now that I have the rules mastered.

I don't think I'll continue with Skull and Shackles. I think the original box and expansion decks have enough replayability and it's probably enough of this sort of game for me.

This was the cat's whiskers a year ago for me but after a whirlwind romance it has gone upstairs out of the regular play area with the last two packs to play intact. Hopefully it'll get some rainy day plays but I think its best days are over for me.

Wow! What a game! Really surprised how captivating and addictive this game is. A great mix of dungeon crawling, deck building, hand management, and dice chucking.

RATING: 8
Having a blast with this one - two player, one character each, the monk and the barbarian. Hurts to see all those spells go by, we'll probably play it again all the way through but going with a magic user next time :)

Lots to like here - progression, but not over the top, each scenario is a little different, but similar enough that we don't need to keep digging into the rules.

And again another 2 player this time Sorcerer and Ranger - and now it hurts a bit to see all the weapons and armor slide on by ;) 

Heartily recommend if you're looking for an adventure cardgame with that dungeon crawl rpg feel.

Why not a '10'? Well some elements are a bit weak or missing - no puzzle solving or other non-combat stuff you might see in an RPG, here it's all beat the monster, avoid the monster, beat the trap, avoid the trap. But saying that still bags of fun :)

Helps having the extra flavour text though.

Update - now have the iPad app, traded the physical game!

The gameplay is quite same-y each scenario, but it is fun. The main point of the game is leveling up your character and getting cool new stuff in your deck.

10x10 2014. Not an RPG or even an RPG replacement really.  Vasel mentioned Talisman in his review and I think that's actually a good reference point for how this game feels.  It's an adventuring type game where you flip over cards to see what you encounter.  The main mechanic is kind of a slow deck building over multiple sessions.  And the persistence of your character over multiple sessions is really cool.  I like that it's co-op but you're also working for your own character's benefit, getting loot to improve your deck and increasing stats is perhaps the most satisfying part of the game.  The different types of dice are fun to roll too and give that old school D&D vibe.  If you get all the expansions there is a ton of game- over 30 scenarios.  I do think after playing it a lot the theme kind of disappears and it becomes a little mechanical.  So in the end, I had some fun with this but playing it a bunch gave me enough of the experience.  I don't think I would want to play through it again or get subsequent sets.

GOOD: Enjoyable cooperative card game. It definitely gives you the RPG feel of leveling up and collecting loot. 

BAD: The rules are not exactly clear even after a major rulebook revision. Also, many of the cards got errata, which might be annoying for some. The choices you can make during the game seem to be quite limited.

RATING: 7.5
My most-played game (in terms of number of plays) since I started logging plays in 2004. 

One of the solutions to the roleplaying game conundrum (which is, briefly, how to get the pencil and paper roleplaying experience without the need for a consistent group and a dungeon master).  This game gives you linked scenarios, character advancement, and rolling for success.  

On the negative side, since it is a boardgame, it has a ruleset that specifies what you can do (rather than being open-ended like a true RPG). And since it is a boardgame, roleplaying is not required -- in fact, you can play it with roleplaying but it slows the game down. At times, the game appears to be somewhat repetitive (explore, try to roll high enough to succeed at a check), which I hope will push me toward doing more on the roleplaying side of things. 

On the positive side, it's a game that my wife and stepson will both play, which makes it a pretty rare thing. And the different characters play differently, which is nice -- more replayability. 

Currently playing this every 2 or 3 months at a monthly game night. Hope to eventually get through all of the scenarios in Rise of the Runelords, but I realize that will take quite a while at this rate. 

Suggestions:
1. The first time someone plays, it may be a good idea to have him/her play with an advisor to help with the game's vocabulary and options. 
2. It's easy to forget that you have special abilities. It's a good idea to look at your character's special abilities between turns to remind yourself of what you can do that is unusual. Making the most of your special abilities is necessary in order to beat the game on a consistent basis. 
3. I suspect the game is best with 3 or 4 characters, especially if you are playing with new players. With 5 or 6 characters, you really have to pay close attention to what you can do when it is not your turn. With 1 or 2 characters, your decks and special abilities won't have much variety and it may be hard to succeed at some of the checks. 
4. I don't think this is a game that can be won on a consistent basis if you take your turn and then leave the table and come back when it is your turn again. (Some of my fellow players have done this.) Looking for ways to cooperate even when it is not your turn will make it easier to win.

The structure of the game, with its hand size being your life, and the way your deck changes over the course of the campaign is a neat mechanic.  But being just a card game, it feels like you're doing the same thing over and over again.  Read a card, role a die, without any variation.  Too much set-up time for not enough theme.  The flavor text is well written though.

-traded away for Bruges and Polis: Fight for Hegemony-

Pathfinder fits the spot for a Pen and Paper RPG in a box...without an opponent.
It feels like character developement indeed but with it's several flaws it stays behind LotR-LCG, for which we thought it might be an alternative.
This games approach to the adventure-card-game is quite nice.

But the other side of the coin is a quite dirty one:
-The rules are horribly written
-The rulebook needs to be restructured
-Gameplay is only random card-draws. It doesn't have the same feeling as LotR where a search feels like a search or a race plays like a race.
-Component quality: (at least for the German Edition) is really really bad. An insert that can't hold the cards while being stored vertically and horrible cards. They came damaged because there was no security that kept them from flying around while the transport.

Since my girlfriend likes the game a lot we will be ending up with the second core game eventually...
...and that is another thing that keeps me thinking.
Ohkay, it's good to start a new setting with a new box and new cards. (Well, I hope that they will be different to the cards from the first box.) But is that really necessary?

We will see what time will do to this.


Now I can say: Time killed the game.
After several games I had no intent to even finish the "story". Every single "adventure" feels the same, it all comes down to "draw a card - roll some dice - repeat".
Boredom in a box (that is waaaay to big and waaaay to appealing for what it has inside).

Can feel like "Roll the dice. Did I win ? oh.. ok"  But it is not a brain burner.

It is the first game I had to alter in card in it. I like the persistant aspect of it.<

I've been having a blast playing this with my girlfriend over the holidays. It definitely has an addictive quality. We keep setting up another round right away just to see what cool loot we may uncover. 

We are most of the way through the second expansion so far and have only failed one mission, and that was mostly due to some really bad and epic dice failures early on. This might be in part due to the character combo we have been using. Looking forward to seeing how it plays with other toons once we finish. Great game.

I held off on trying this for years because I thought it looked so stupid: flip a card, roll dice. Flip, roll. Rinse and repeat. 

When I finally came around to trying it, however, I found myself unable to stop playing. There is something compellingly, compulsively fun about this game. The theme really comes through, the cards combo in interesting ways, and you really have to be cooperative, solving problems together and helping each other out wherever possible. And the leveling-up mechanism is perfectly timed: upgrades happen slowly, but not too slowly, so that you want to keep playing to see your character grow.

I'm over 80 plays in, and still loving every minute of this game. Skull and Shackles is great, too!

Gets somewhat stale.  Not enough variety in the monsters and locations.  Tons of errata is a pain.  Paizo really should offer a cheap "fix it" pack for those of us who bought the first printing.  Card quality is mediocre, which sucks for a card game - especially one where you shuffle the cards a lot.  All that said, I really enjoy this game! :)

At first I enjoyed the game but it becomes very samey quickly and unless you do the slow introduction house rules on BGG of the cards then your decks don't really change after a few games. Also some of the mechanics don't work well such as the fighters lose the fewest cards when hurt so why clutter your deck with armour?

RATING: 8.5
Not had a dud run yet.  Most plays have been with 5 or 6 players.  It is definitely a different game with more players - character death not an issue but time definitely is.  With 1-3 players, player death becomes the greater impediment to finishing.

(Missing recorded plays - probably about 5-6 more than recorded here)

RATING: 4
Most of the game is flip a card, roll some dice, hope that you roll high. Sometimes you will have to ask yourself how many resources you want to burn in order to feel like the odds are good enough in the rolling high part. Now, I am not a fan of post-decision randomness, the only game I felt did this well was Arcadia Quest, so mechanically, this isn't the kind of game I'm going to enjoy playing.

The between missions levelling up could be really cool (it certainly is in Arcadia Quest), but the cards simply aren't interesting. There's no combos to build and most of the decisions boil down to would I rather have the sword? Or the sword +1? Which isn't actually a decision at all.

Essentially, this feels like a card game version of grinding in CRPGs. In terms of the gameplay, where you just draw card after card, trying to play through all the cards so as to be able to close locations and end the scenario. Also in the levelling up, where you have to play through scenarios in order to get slightly better at things you could already do before (and I'm willing to bet that the monsters get tougher the further you go, so improving is illusionary).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There's actually some really neat stuff at work here. There's a lot of randomness, and to get good at the game you really have to learn how to account for it and control it. Mostly through the use of Blessings, but also in generally how you build your deck.

This is a game of risk analysis and you are constantly being asked to make choices. That's great, but I feel like a lot of the plays feel fairly obvious after just a game or two. So while I enjoy the game, I feel like there's something missing in the turn-to-turn play for me.

So what you have more or less, then, is a game largely about its progression system. Yeah, most RPG-ish games have character progression, but it's a fun and different way to do it and ends up being fairly addictive.

It's fascinating how each class feels true to its RPG roots through use of the card mechanics. Since magic users tend to have bigger hand limits, they're capable of taking more damage per turn and thus feel more vulnerable.

A weird compliment, but the box insert in this is fantastic. It makes setup and teardown a breeze and even has handy-dandy slots for future adventure packs and your current party. Nice!

It does feel a bit odd to have put the "first" adventure pack in its own cardboard box WITHIN the box... but I guess it's nice if you dig consistency. Also I'm not sure if it's just my copy, but the backings for the cards in the first adventure pack run slightly darker so you can tell the difference between the base cards and the "expansion." Not a huge deal, but it does feel like a pretty n00b mistake.

Update: Ended up trading this. At its best this game is a 7, but the scripted turn-to-turn play really hurts it after awhile. Yeah, occasionally you get some tense choices with the Blessing system but unfortunately those become less and less frequent the further into the campaign you go. The difficulty just plateaus after a point and never picks back up. It really is a shame. I even bought the next Adventure pack and didn't even have to play it to know it wouldn't fix this. The enemy stats are roughly in line with everything in the base game and don't even scale based on adventure number, which is both surprising and a HUGE disappointment. I can happily live without this game.

RATING: 8
If you like RPGs, especially the fantasy genre, and enjoy card games/deck building this is a must. There is a lot of luck involved, but the players have control over that luck by choosing what cards they want to have in their deck.

It feels about the right difficulty but has a bit of a learning curve. It is challenging especially with new characters and it often feels that failure is just around the corner, but I've found that the win ratio is high enough to keep stop it becoming frustrating.

This is ideally a game that is played over many sessions, improving the character each time.

-edit-
After having the game for several months I've lowering the score I've awarded the game from 9 to 8. For a game than needs to be played long term, there isn't enough variety in the gameplay.

Fun game if playing with friends. If solo... I'd wait for the mobile app. Too many cards to fiddle around with.

(EDIT: Came back to this game after not playing for more than 1 year. Somehow, the mechanics that seemed so difficult ran more smoothly now, to the point where I'm able to get in 2 games in 1 evening. Maybe it's more experience playing a whole lot of different games?

Holy sh*t this game is overhyped! It’s probably the most overhyped game I can think of. Of course this is just my opinion, and I respect that a lot of people love it, and its rating cannot be questioned, but it’s just not for me. At all. I don’t see the appeal in this game. Yes, on paper I thought it sounded great that you get a character you can evolve over many plays etc., but in reality the game itself is so extremely repetitive and boring… I mean, you do the same thing over and over again: turn over a card and roll the dice to do a skill check. Sometimes you fail, other times you lose, but rarely is the penalty for losing too serious as we’ve never lost a game (always won rather easily), and I know that it’s the general consensus that it’s just way too easy. 

Come on, the whole idea of cooperative games is that they should be hard as hell so you often lose so that you want to go back and win! This desire is non-existing for me in the case of Pathfinder. Even the way you kill the monsters and his henchmen is the same. Yes, there are various bosses and locations and weapons etc., but the chore gameplay mechanism is extremely boring because of its repetitive nature. I don’t even feel like there is a story behind the game. Yuck. Sorry, this game is simply bad, and I do think it will drop in the ratings as people (perhaps?) start to feel it’s just “more of the same”.

I wanted to like this more. I was attracted to the great idea of a character leveling up from game to game! I was hoping for more of a deck builder then a dice roller. Players explore an area only to flip over a card and do a check, and then roll a dice and see what happens. This game can be really good if the adventure scenarios are played and players develop their characters. The standalone game is very dismal and has no sense of accomplishment. I would play it, but I don't want to commit too much time and money to this game. The checks and dice rolls seem to random for me, but I do respect the innovation of this game, I just wish it was done with more card play.

The character building seems fun and the threat of real death adds a certain charm.  This is not a sit down and play every now and again game though, you really need to invest in the campaign to see it shine (or so it seems after a play).  There are some unique deck building aspects to how this plays, even if a lot of it is just rolling the die to pass skill checks.  I really didn't like that the game wants you to write on your character cards to track advancements.

The comment may be biased since I am not a big fan of deck-building game(though I pretty enjoy Mage Knight and Marvel DBG) and TRPG, but i can't really get the point of this game. Every turn you just simply draw a card, roll the dice, resolve it, then go on and on. It may have some role-playing element in it since the character keep getting stronger with your deck, but i can't feel the difference between weapons or magic, for me it just means a different dice to roll. 

Despite of my abhorrent of the game, this game is actually quite popular among my friends 'cause of its easy-setup, simplicity and short-playing time.

I really do like this game and its setting.  The best feature is keeping and improving your decks and leveling up between games.  My only real problem with the game is that it feels a bit easy most of the time, as far as for a single fight.  The difficulty for most missions is a race against time, which keeps it interesting, but usually when we discover a boss card we wouldn't have too much trouble winning the fight.

After playing 3 times solo with using 2 characters, I found that the game is monotonic with limited replay value.  Dice rolling becomes dominant in the game. No great surprise or strategic planning during the game play.  But but but..... when I played this game with 2-3 players, this game becomes much more fun and vivid with co-op operations and planning.  It becomes a very good game for 2-3 players!

Remarks:
The illustrations of the cards are not bad but some of them are in oil painting styles and some are in Japanese Anime.  Not quite comfortable for this inconsistency illustration style!

RATING: 5
An RPG themed game that simply doesn't hold up to repeated play.

Like an RPG, the game succeeds at making you care for the characters in your party.  That party doesn't really cooperate as they would in an RPG however.  In fact, their lack of cooperation can be very counter-intuitive. 

After playing a set of characters through the skinsaw adventures I traded my set away.

Perhaps our characters got lucky early on, several chests were opened and good weapons found in the Peril's mini adventure.  For whatever reason, we found almost nothing of value to acquire during the Burnt AP, and only had two of the adventures require a second try to complete.  Similar story in Skinsaw, with the exception of the tough Foul Misgivings scenario where Ieasha's unbeatable whammy kiss almost killed several characters. 

The game quickly becomes repetitive because ... it _is_ incredibly, criminally repetitive.  And not just at its core, its repetitive right on the surface.  If you're not discovering goodies and encountering interesting monsters/banes ... that repetitiveness quickly grates.  As an example, there are sites that require encountering a Bandit henchman every turn ... a criteria we simply ignore as by this point our character can dispatch such puny scum with impunity, so why waste our precious time rolling for it?

The game has many production flaws, to the point of being amateurish.  The rule book leaves an inordinate amount of questions (as witnessed by the 75+ pages of forum posts) in part because it has several illogical stipulations (such as characters in the same location can't (for most purposes) fight together)).  Card backs from the base set have a different hue than those of adventure packs an unforgivable error in a game of this sort as it means AP cards are obvious in a stack.  And there is practically no attempt at providing a back story or narrative structure to tie scenarios together (but there's an excellent adventure guide here on BGG).

I tried he first expansion AP (Skinsaw) which failed miserably to win me over to the concept of spending $20 for more of same repetition.  The game has some merit, but the production gaffs and repetitious gameplay keep it from being a real winner.

In the end, there are simply too many other good games to play, several in this genres, although none seem to allow decks built across numerous game sessions as Pathfinder does.

This game is in my top 3.  Haven't yet made it past Level 3 as when the character dies, we reset the game back to the beginning.

I do need a break between dying and starting again, to stop the game getting stale.

one of the most boring games I've played. For a game that is supposed to be simulating RPGs it has absolutely no flavor or theme at all.

Pathfinder is a damn good game.

Oh man, what a great game. It combines cards with many aspects of a rpg. In some way it feels a bit like a MMO video game: Your main motivation is to level your char and get better items (to optimize your deck).

Not a big fan of deck building games but the folks at paizo have made one here which works rather well. 

With a bit more complexity, this is what the Lord of the Rings LCG wanted to be. It is capabale of providing a good balanced, fun game whether solo or up to 6 players. 

My only grumbles are the cost of the base game (paying for air), and that there isn't enough variety in the cards that you get. Some cards are auto no-brainers to keep, while others give bonuses to rolls that currently don't exist in the game, making them worthless.

I think paizo have a good game on their hands here, providing that they keep it going as a single game and not make whole new box sets based on different RPG adventure paths. Keep everything compatible and things will be fine.

This could very well be one of the most disappointing games I've ever played. I love RPG's. I love having a character with stats. I love rolling dice for skill checks. 

I don't like this game.

I'm not criticizing it as just "flip a card and roll a die". I'm criticizing it because of the plentiful opportunities for choices the game could have had and just didn't bother to flush out. For example:

-Though it's more thematic to not know what card you're encountering until you arrive at a location, without knowing what the differences are in the cards beforehand, the locations lack a strong identity against which a decision can be made. Instead, one is just making a decision based on the location's special "effect" which often doesn't relate to what's going on in a given turn. This makes choosing a location several degrees less interesting than it could have been. 

-There are too many instances where the math just doesn't line up for a character. Though it's possible another character might be able to help, it's not a guarantee. This creates "nothing" turns where a player just can't do anything. This unfortunately reminds me of games like Mille Bornes where you're essentially "blocked" until you just so happen to draw or acquire the right card. 

-All of the special effects on the locations plus the special effects of the scenario theoretically seem like they should produce a thematic feel. Instead, they reinforce to me the idea that "less is more". Take a game like Pandemic. A player has a special ability unique to them and they might have a card or two with a special ability. The choice surrounding these is when to use them and how to use them (which is good). However, you don't see every space on the Pandemic map have a special ability because that would be more distracting than helpful in setting up meaningful choices for the players. One spends more time in the Pathfinder card game trying to keep track of things rather than making decisions about those things.

-The set-up time is disproportionate to the quality of game one is being offered. I personally don't feel like the lengths the game designer went to to create thematic reinforcement for the different locations pays off. Having no spells in the deck at one location and lots for another doesn't make me feel like I'm exploring a particularly magical area. 

All in all, this game is unfortunately less than the sum of it's parts. Each of the ideas in the game, in isolation, seem good but there's just no real pay off in them (at least not for me).

I've tried house ruling the game into something I would consider "playable" but I'm now to the point where I'm having to make drastic changes to really see any improvement and I've still got a long way to go. 

All of this is not to say that enjoying the game is some sort of indictment on a person's gaming tastes. I'm also not saying that this game has to be anything more than a relatively straight forward card game in order to be fun. It doesn't have to be an RPG. It just has to be a game that's fun to play and it's just not that for me - and I truly wish it was otherwise.

Reasonably good game. Would keep it were it not for the ongoing expenditure to keep up with new packages. LotR LCG fills the LCG fantasy niche for me much better, from both a thematic and gameplay perspective. Glad to have traded it away.

+ interesting leveling up

- cartoony art
- gameplay is not meaty enough for me
- post-scenario thinning of deck to 15 or so cards is totally anti-climactic

This is a strange one. I think the game, as a game, is purely OK. The campaign play, however, takes it up a notch or two and turns it into a fun filler to play quickly and slowly watch my character grow.

I am saddened by the fact that future story arcs seem to be as two-dimensional as the base game without learning from other games. Too bad, as worth LOTR LCG-style adventures, this game could have been amazing.

I've played the first scenario three times now in order to teach myself the game.  The first two attempts went rather too well and gave the impression that the game is too easy.

I thought the third run through with the cleric and fighter combination would be a walk over.  The game bit back, the random monsters were tough,  I failed to close out the first location after discovering the first henchman, subsequent henchmen took a long time to locate and finally the cleric's weapon cards and most of the blessing cards were initially unavailable.  I started to make low rolls in combat and consequently needed to spend a lot of the clerics actions up on self healing.

I had one turn left for the fighter and one location left open and the only way I could win was a confrontation with the villain.  I explored uncovering the villain won the combat and kept my perfect record so far with no time to spare.  The best laid plans do not survive contact with the cards and dice but it does add to the drama.  

I believe this kind of game needs uncertain outcomes and random elements for replay.  

Upside:
Scenario Replayability
Drama
Character Progression
Card Driven Narrative

Downside:
Ultimate Success Can be Down to Dice and Card Draw
Mechanically Repetitive (scenario variation will be key to long term appeal)
Rules are Difficuly to Reference
Game Design Assumes Consequent Purchases (but there is quite a lot of game play in the base set)
Game Balance and Character Variation May Suffer if Players are into Min-Maxing

I will be re-reading the rules in the light of the first three games and this game lends its self to learning as you play.  I have used the least generous interpretation when in doubt and I do not expect to have given myself too many advantages by getting rules wrong.

Three characters seems to a sweet spot for difficulty.  Played this game twice with two friends and the game was won on the last turn of the card in both cases.  Could go up to 9 if the new scenarios have sufficient variation.  This could turn out to be a money pit over next two years if Piazo have ways of extending the games appeal.

2015 Looking forward to this on IOS.

Cool game.  
Deducting marks for having to buy expansions to get the "full" game. 
Also deducting marks for not having sheets to write on, and having it so that you write on the cards.  If I had done that, instead of printing out the sheets, replayability factor become almost nil.

I will add points for having the box big enough to hold the expansions, and very well organized.
Also adding points for the company providing free downloads of the sheets you will want to write on, so you don't have to write on the cards.

This is the go to couple game for me right now.  Honestly, as a stand alone it probably gets a five.  The game play is a little predictable and there is not much excitement.  The saving grace is the RPG feel where you get the same character.  You definitely need to play with permadeath to find anything you do exciting.  The set up is pretty annoying but the game plays in about 30 min to an hour.  I think it would really shine with more than two players but you cant really have multiple campaigns out of the same box because you need to keep the decks.

Pathfinder ACG has manged to incorporate all the great mechanics of RPGs, into a card game. While allowing for those that have neither the skills or desire to dramatize or act, which is often a barrier to RPGs.

Played first two scenarios at bggcon (taught well by two enthusiasts).  The base game was okay, but there was no story telling.  It seems the scenario could have somehow told a story by inserting cards into the set-up.  I played up some of the role-playing aspects, but in the end, I was left a little flat.  At least Wrath of Ashardalon has a spatial component (with no more or less real story).  I couldn't tell why the second one was different than the first (despite that we were chasing a poisoner, which should be different).

I really liked this system. It was fun, although wonky and redundant at times. In any case, easy to house rule, and not terribly challenging (unless you played with too few or too many players/characters).  The system is addictive even if redundant, easy to put up for a while, and then miss your old friends and pull it back out and pick up where you left off! Great way to spend some time with some friends chucking some dice-laughing, cheering, and yelling when your D12 rolls a 1! Love the expansion arc.  I'm ok that it isn't evergreen like many thought it would be. By the end of 6 packs I'm ready to visit new characters and new lands...or play again with a new character class!

Low strategy game that tells a story....limited decisions to make and lots of dice rolling.  This is a good game to play with the kiddos.  They like the fact that that the characters develop over time and there is a story.  I cannot see too many adults liking this one.

Update:  Playing this with a group now.  I find it to be a good 'social' game.  With four the coop factor and team-play really kicks in.  I now see this as a game for those who are looking for a good RPG group but do not have the time for campaigns or the set-up involved with a good RPG.  Also, the fact that someone does not have to DM the damn thing is a plus.

Draw a card, roll a bunch of dice, watch you character succeed or fail and eventually grow stronger. By all rights, this shouldn't be as much fun as it is. Maybe it helps that I've played the Pathfinder RPG for a couple of years now (and know this particular adventure path and the story behind what seems like arbitrary card names and abilities), however, I find myself truely enyoing this game. Immersion is greatly helped by the fanmade story-guide with prologues and epilogues for all adventures.

I enjoy this game. No GM needed. Cards do all the work. We play 1 scenario every weekend. With all the adventure decks available and the losses we incured this game has lasted us 1 year.
Replayability factor is good if you choose another Hero to play with.

Update. Been playing this game for over 1 year. After a while it becomes repetative, not that this is a bad thing because the scenarios keep getting more difficult. Bought the other base set Skull and Shackles and it seems to have lost it's appeal mid way.

Incredible mix of fun, cooperation, and strategy.

RATING: 5
I had high hopes for Pathfinder ACG as I wanted a long-term game with an element of noticeable progression, but sadly this one just doesn't deliver. 

The biggest problem with this game is that there are WAY too many random factors that essentially dictate whether or not you'll be successful: from the composition of the location decks, to the quality of the cards you add to your own deck, to the binary success/failure outcomes of actions tied to dice rolls, to good ol' fashioned luck of the draw, when you win in this game it feels more like it was because the stars aligned in your favor rather than you and your teammates devising a winning strategy. 

This could be forgiven if a game weaves a compelling narrative, but there is essentially none. Each scenario has a paragraph or so of narrative context given to it, but there isn't much to differentiate one scenario from another once you start actually playing the game. You're just drawing a bunch of cards, then rolling a bunch of dice hoping you get lucky enough to find and beat the villain-of-the-day before you run out of turns, and if you win you move onto the next one. It's a very dry and mechanical experience, which isn't something one would expect from a game that tries to present itself as an RPG-lite. 

For all my criticisms, Patherfinder ACG is at least an honest attempt to blend RPG and board game, and it isn't entirely without merit. The game, while dull, does mostly work, and the character building aspect is nothing if not detailed. However for the amount of time and money this game demands as an investment (it's clearly purpose-built to sell expansions), it's a rather poor value overall. If you want an RPG, just play an RPG.

This game is much lighter than I expected, I also don't think it lives up to it's geek rating. I bought this knowing it would be a primarily solo affair, which can be enjoyable but there aren't enough intriguing decisions for me. Plus, there's so much errata already. The card text lacks a great deal of precision, which is a problem for this type of game. Also, the whole adventure path has already been printed so these issues won't be "fixed" with the expansions, it will probably just make the FAQ even longer...ugh. Finally, the difficulty is completely random, but the game is still pretty easy. I have never lost in my 8 plays so far (all solo with 2 characters). 

Overall though it's still playable and fun can be had, but it could be so much better. I can't wait for someone to do something like this and fix all these issues. That could be a sweet game.

We played the intro scenario to the Pathfinder card game.  I enjoyed the play, but it was obvious that it was a training scenario.  I am afraid that they scales it back so much that I will not be able to get the guys again in case it turns out to be a great game.
I am looking forward to seeing more game play as my character advances.  It looks solid, but is not much fun without the upgrades and game play that are missing in the intro scenario.  
Hopefully my rating will improve after some more plays.

Very conflicted feelings about this game... I really enjoy having your character become better and better as the game progresses, and it can get quite addicting. However, the game play is rather simplistic and repetitive. Most decisions are very simplistic and straight forward. I don't really feel like I am playing with a party of adventurers. I can't see myself playing the 30+ scenarios with such a repetitive mechanic. Maybe the future expansions add more variety.

As an RPG, I just don't see it either. 

It kind of reminds me of when I used to play WoW. The gameplay wasn't so great, but the possibility of getting better loot was what kept me going back to it.

Also, I was disappointed with the design of the cards. Don't get me wrong, I really like Paizo's artwork (look at the Pathfinder RPG rule books, a lot of the art seems to be pulled from there), but the way it was used in the cards themselves it doesn't give it justice and is rather bland to look at.

I may give it a few more tries, but I am glad I didn't buy it before playing it.

Loved this at first and played it a lot the few weeks after it came out. Eventually,  the shine wore off. The scenarios are rather samey, or at least feel that way, and it's very hard to get the same group together to play it over and over. The small advances in characters between scenarios were disappointing, and even getting cool equipment boiled down to using a different die or getting a reroll. Nice try, but doesn't quite work in the long run.

I had high hopes for this game but the gameplay is falling flat so far. The best part about this game is the leveling, but the campaign and gameplay boil down to a series of random card draw and dice roll to close locations. Defeating the boss is fun but not so much closing locations. Card text is functional and the art is okay but there's really no flavor to the game beyond that like I'm used to in other theme-focused games.

Picked this up in November of 2013 based on the reviews and play-throughs available on BGG.  I explained the game to Jen before I picked it up at a FLGS and promised her that she could get her own custom-colored dice to play the game.  We started with Harsk (me) and Merisel (Jen) to learn the game and it went very well.  I've tried playing this solo with just one character, but didn't have very much success.  We finally played this as a foursome with Valeros, Lini, Merisiel and Seoni ... the game was quite memorable with a win in the first scenario on the second to last turn of the game.

We're now playing with two parties of four, the second of which has just finished Trouble in Sandpoint.  The second party includes Ezren, Harsk, Lini and Kyra.  In hindsight, I think another damage dealer or maybe Lem would have been a better choice for Lini since we have two characters that are being used for cures when Kyra could probably handle it all on her own.  We've had Lini drop one of her cures, which makes her a little more fragile, but with more options for spells.

I think I wanted to like this more than I actually like it.  It is by no means even close to replacing a tabletop rpg for me.  The theme is there, but the flavor doesn't really come through.  Yes, when I play I read the flavor text, and try to create a narrative that explains the events as they unfold, but it is still lacking.  At this point I've played all of the scenarios through 4.5 of the chapters, and there are only two that really stand out in my mind (one is a zombie apocalypse, and the other involves a dam bursting and flooding a town).  All of the others have just been playing whack-a-mole with the villain.  

Why have I played so much if I don't like it that much?  A good buddy of mine enjoys playing it, and I enjoy playing it with him.  The two of us have stuck by our characters as they have slowly evolved over the course of the "story."  I can't think of any other board/card games that do that.  It is the one thing that the PACG does well, and is fairly unique in that regard.  I highly doubt I'll be picking up future iterations.

Edit:  Chris Deavellar's thoughts, which are much more eloquent than mine, sum up how I feel, so I have taken the liberty of reproducing them here: 


For me, there's two shades of disappointment with this game. Firstly, I find the game as it exists to be...dull. Not awful, just boring. The mechanics, decisions, and cooperative gameplay all leave me wanting. Secondly, I find that I punish this game for what it isn't. That's never entirely fair, but playing this game leaves with this frustrated sense of what it could have been.

Criticizing what it is is, of course, subjective. Many have said that there's more to the game than "flip a card, roll a die", but to me, that's what the game feels like. Sure, we get to decide which deck to flip cards from. We get to play cards to give us more or less dice, and even solicit dice from other players via blessings. We get do play cards to flip another card, if we're feeling frosty. But at the end of the day, I find the act of picking a deck, flipping a card, and rolling a die to be thin. Worse is that the act of fighting a monster is the exact same as the act of finding a useless potion is the exact same as fighting a Henchman is the exact same as fighting the villain.

The persistent character deck seems so tantalizing, but you can't really morph your character into anything beyond what it is. I've played two characters thus far (Monk and Sorcerer). I hated the Monk. His deck/hand management actually seemed to work against itself, and I felt no sense of my deck clicking. The Sorceress works much better. But, even with her deck functioning better, I find that she plays the same way. She has a bunch of cards that add dice. She doesn't feel markedly different from the Monk. The deck setup just seems to function better. 99% of the loot you find during a session is useless. The majority of it is just variations on what you already have, rather than improvements. This never makes my character feel any sense of progression, and makes looting feel superfluous. The game is so overloaded with stats and dice, most of which do nothing. There are massive amounts of keywords, and roll types, and items, and everything just feels the same.

The game seems to actually discourage cooperation. With only a couple of exceptions, being in the same locations is generally useless at best, and harmful at worst. The theme just totally breaks down for me in this respect. The idea that the Ranger can shoot an arrow into the air from the Church to help me out in whatever underground dungeon I'm in, but if he were standing next to me he could do nothing, along with basically every other character except for the fighter. The only thing to do on someone else's turn is drop a blessing to help out, generally at the cost of being effective on your own turn (more a problem with the Monk than the Sorceress, but still). When I play the aforementioned Pandemic, or Gears of War, or Arkham Horror, we're constantly talking about what we're doing and where we're going. With PACG, I find myself waiting for my turn, or waiting for a blessing solicitation. I don't feel like part of a team of adventurers trying to locate and stop the villain. I feel like I'm trying to flip and burn as many cards as fast as possible to find the card that I'm looking for.

What I wanted was a cooperative dungeon crawl in card form. A game where my party traverses dangerous dungeons fighting our way to defeat some nefarious evil, collecting fat loots along our way. I wanted a character with character. I wanted loot that made me immediately want to slay something larger and tougher. I wanted monsters that didn't act like potions. I wanted a villain with personality, with a climactic boss-fight, perhaps even with a little AI that required teamwork, and a little puzzle-solving. Sadly, what I got, was flip a card-roll a die. Hell, even though we read the scenarios aloud, I couldn't tell what the hell is going on, and frankly the game hasn't given me any reason to care.

To sum up...I'm mostly punishing this for what it isn't. This is all subjective. The game just bores me, and obviously isn't for me. But damn, it seems like it should be. It seems like the elements are there for a GREAT game. It seems tantalizingly close to something I would love. But it just isn't, and that sense of lurking greatness makes it all the more disappointing.

The amount of errata in the first printing bothers me a tad...but the game is interesting enough to play.  I have only played this solo...but feel the experience would be the same with multiple players.  I worry that the goal of each scenario will always be the same, find a villain and defeat it, and this worry keeps my rating lower...should I come across new scenario goals I would consider raising this to a good game/very good game rating.

I love dungeon crawls and fantasy theme in games.  I love the idea of using clever play or rule breaking combinations of spells and equipment to do something fun and spectacular in a highly thematic game.  Pathfinder appears to offer none of that, in my one and probably only play.  Whatever machinations the spells, allies, items, and feats do, they boil down to rolling certain numbers and certain kinds of dice.  If the total on the dice is more than the number on the card, congratulations.  It's not spring surprise, but I still have to ask, where's the pleasure in that?  I'd lower the score further, but I do kind of love the game altering campaign mode used here (and ripped off from Risk Legacy).

Rating after a long struggle with the rule book and a couple of plays.

An enjoyable card game that does go some way towards creating the D&D rpg feel. I'm hoping this will udge up to an 8 if this holds up to repeated plays to offset the slight negatives around the rule book and the first/second printing colour mismatches which I am inflicted with.

The rulebook really needed a glossary of terms and a more detailed look (with diagrams of cards concerned) regarding skills (sub=skills) and traits. Some of the card wording is also a little 'loose'.

Gripes aside a good game though.

RATING: 7
Really impressed with this after two plays (both with 5 players). Everyone seemed to want to play it again to see how their decks would evolve on an Adventure Path.

No rules questions in our first games - clean system - some challenging individual and group decisions - nice pace.

Rating might go up.

EDIT: Rating actually went down. Played through the first two adventures with all 8 folks in our group. One decided it was too abstract and light (he's a hardcore RPG guy). Five of us signed on to do the next two adventures. After that session we decided that the decisions are too much the same and the loot is so marginally incremental that each session gets repetitive.

Rating of 7 is based on a 9 for concept/design and a 5 for replay-ability.

RATING: 5
Players are RPG heroes, cooperating to defeat a scenario, which forms part of an ongoing campaign.  Characters can level up after a scenario.

Weird game, pitched as an RPG card game.  Players take on a character (I was a dwarf ranger named Harsk), and build a deck of items, allies, weapons, etc.  That deck represents your health and if it depletes, you are dead.  The deck can be "recharged" by placing cards underneath, to keep your health topped up.

The game involves characters moving to locations (individually sculpted decks, based on setup rules - i.e. the woods are full of monsters, the academy full of spells), flip a card, and interact with it in some way.  This may involve fighting it, attempting to acquire it, etc.  Acquiring a card increases your deck potential, making you stronger.  

The goal of the scenario changes (I assume), but in ours we had to locate a villain, defeat it, but ensure every other location was "closed down" so he couldn't run away.  After literally 75 minutes to play five turns and understand the rules, we quickly defeated the scenario.

I can't say this game is great - I'm astonished at the love and BGG rating.  It simply involved flipping a card and rolling some dice, augmenting the roll with some equipment from your hand - it was hardly a challenge.  There was really no thematic connection here - this is not a role playing game.  As a solo game it may be mildly diverting, but as a cooperative game for four adults, there are much, much, much better options out there.  I will play it again to see it improves, but it only has one more chance...

RATING: 7
On its surface, it is mainly just flip a card, roll some dice.  However, there are some interesting decisions to be made, and teamwork between characters is key.  I find it strangely compelling in a way that Descent 2 was not for me.  Perhaps there is some merit in stripping the idea down to its essence.  I think the idea of slowing developing my character is the hook for me.  Whether that is enough to keep me interested through 6 adventure decks remains to be seen.

UPDATE Oct 2014:
We're about halfway through adventure 1, and the shine is starting to come off this a bit.  We'll see how far we get.  I think that the most interesting thing about this game is the way you build your character, and while that is fairly novel for this type of game, I am not sure I ultimately find that compelling enough to sustain my enthusiasm.  

UPDATE Nov 2014:
Well, my son (age 7) gave me a very well reasoned agruement as to why Pathfinder was not his favorite game.  "I have to wait 10 minutes between my turns, and when it is my turn I barely know what I'm doing."  Fair enough.  As for me, I am finding the game repetitive, and gaining a +1 here and there is no longer thrilling me.  I am also perplexed as to how I continue to find this game so finicky to deal with rules-wise.  
I think I'll be turning to Lord of the Rings Card Game for a similar questing card game, but with more interesting mechanisms.  I'm also looking forward to Assault on Doomrock, which I hope will be more of what I hoped to get out of Pathfinder.  I just don't think the long campaign thing is for me with this particular game.  I think this game may be too reliant on the appeal of slowly leveling up, and the game guts underneath aren't really interesting and varied enough to sustain the game long-term.

UPDATE June 2016
The app has revived this game for me.  I love it in the digital format.  No more endless card shuffling, no more finicky rules to figure out, and it feels much less repetitive becuase it moves muh faster.

Public service announcement for my board and card gaming brethren:

This is a card game. It is not a roleplaying game. While it can be confusing, because it has some of the surface trappings of popular conceptions of RPGs (namely a fantasy theme and persistant characters across sessions, although many RPGs don't have those at all), it is no more an RPG than Agricola is, even though you can pretend to be a farmer and tell a story about your family's economic fortunes.

Here is a simple rubric to help delineate: ask yourself, what takes precedence over what my character can do, the story or the rules? In an RPG, you can attempt anything you want, whether or not the rules specifically allow it. In a non-RPG, you can only do what the rules allow, even if it doesn't make sense. 

An example: in an RPG, two characters travel together to the village inn. This happens because of course two people can walk together somewhere. In the PACG, one person travels to the inn. The other person can't go yet because it's not his turn, even though in the story there is no reason why they can't travel together. The logic of the rules trumps the logic of the story. 

Anyway:

-----

Lightweight, breezy fun.  A game of resource and risk management, with a lot of clever ideas that reinforce the theme.  Persistent character decks that carry over between scenarios is great.

Scales very well across the player range.  More options to act/help when it's not your turn, or to peek ahead at the deck, would be good.

(Comes with all expansion packs and character add-on deck)


The geekiest game I own, which also makes it the coolest.  I love card games.  I love hand management, trick taking, deckbuilding, and the uncertainty that comes with playing the odds.  I also really love getting new cards and abilities that amp you up as you play more games.  Pathfinder has all of this.  The overall game experience is extremely fun and rewarding - this game will probably usurp Dominion's four year reign as my favorite card game.  There's tons of replayability here, especially when it comes to deck building and customization.  I look forward to really wearing this game out.  It's awesome!

We finished playing all the scenarios in the base set and this game is more awesome than I originally thought - the emotional arcs that come with the dice rolls and card flips are really exhilirating, and the locations' abilities and deck compositions bring out the theme's juicy flavor.

Really fun game.  I'm always get a good laugh when I play it.  A tiger riding halfling with a flame enchanted sling squaring off against a hill giant down by the river is my idea of a good time.  This game is trying real hard to become my favorite and I'm having a hard time not letting it.

I stand by my rating of the base game, but the expansions really fail to take this game anywhere.  They're really just more of the same, and it can get kind of boring.  The dice rolls get really ridiculous too. If I had it to do all over again, I'd probably stop buying stuff at Hook Mountain, and I would have skipped on the character add-on deck.  

Another game will probably come along that stands on PACG's shoulders, and really knock it out of the park.  I wait impatiently.

To loathe the boring session that encompasses this game. I really don't understand why people praise this game. Its just so boring and has no atmosphere. Flip a card and resolve, then wait. Cleric turns can take forever because they keep burning blessings to go again, and again, while fighters get one turn and wait 15 minutes to go again. Why is this popular again?  Bards burn all their cards to help everyone and their turn comes up and they get to do one thing and then sit for 15 minutes. Just not fun and can turn into a snooze fest. Rules are poorly written, too many small things to keep track of without having clear ways to do so.

I only play it because my friends do and I really would rather watch a soap opera. Much better ways to enjoy a role playing game than this tedium.

This game just didn't appeal to me much at all. I played it knowing Pathfinder and D&D and without knowing the Rise of the Runelords adventure path.

Nothing at all about the game reminded me at all of working as a group or playing D&D. It felt like a very random game scrambling between arbitrary piles of cards.

Tried playing it more times, and have even since done much of the adventure path it is based on. My impression is not improved.

The game should have more ways of helping each other and working as a group as opposed to incentivizing the players to immediately scatter. I've never once played a game of Pathfinder or D&D that actually had a hard clock time limit where you just fail game over if you take more than X turns. None of it makes sense to me, and many of those things that don't make sense aren't conventions of boardgames or deckbuilding games either. They just seem to be deliberate dubious choices in the design of this specific game.

This is a game that I play "If I have to" because someone else insists that it be played. I play it on the condition that we then play something that I'll enjoy more.

Also, it takes too long to set up for my taste. Too many piles to set up, etc.

(Rating mainly based on solo play)

A light weight role playing game with kind of a deckbuilding element (you keep your deck and it changes over time). It's the perfect dungeon crawl game for me: Almost nonexistent story, fast play and most of the focus on upgrading your character. There's also almost no tactical movement. Normally you simply turn over the top card of the location you're at and deal with what comes up. It's kind of like Munchkin in that regard, but that's almost an insult.

However, the co-op element is not the strongest. Sure, you can work together, but if you have characters that can take care of themselves, you can go explore on your own - which I think is a good thing. The co-op element is probably most apparent when it comes to trading loot.

Negative points are that it almost takes too long to set up for what it is. There's a lot of searching for cards, distributing cards and shuffling cards. Your hands are busier setting up than actually playing the game because often times it's just flip over a card, roll a die and end your turn.

First of all, I can’t help but compare the game to LOTR:TCG as I’m already committed to that one and wasn’t sure if I had the space in my gaming life to accommodate another coop LCG. I found I did because this was ostensibly less complicated (i.e., rules checking) than LOTR:TCG and for the way I could connect to a character who would progress through each scenario instead of just playing the blue deck, red/green deck, etc. I definitely have the geek “level up” gene and enjoy that kind of experience.

But the game’s charm wore off rather quickly. The biggest weak point of the game is how each scenario ends the same way with closing locations and defeating the villain. This process is nowhere near as diverse or interesting as LOTR:TCG manages. Furthermore, the card play is not nearly as rich as LOTR:TCG, and we found that while you can play cards on each other’s checks, we were largely disconnected with each other during the game. We like the way we interact in LOTR:TCG much more. Finally, I was put off by the way the next big box expansion is not compatible with characters from the Runelords base set and will require purchase.

Impulse purchase, December 2013.

So far, Pathfinder has provided a fun two player experience; my wife and I enjoy the bildungsroman and cooperative aspects. I'm quite familiar with the D&D 3.5 Edition, so the implementation of the D20 mechanics and general genre conventions in a CCG rules set is interesting.

Thus far we've completed the Lost Coast chapter and are working through the Burnt Offering adventures. Our party of four (Valeros (fighter), Seoni (sorcerer), Harsk (ranger) and Merisiel (rogue)) are progressing well.

I initially rated this an 8.5; however, after realizing that I've played it every day since I received it, I'm going to have to up that to a 9.5. Are there issues? Sure, a few uncertainties, but otherwise this is a fun "dungeon romp". Excellent job Paizo!

Holy moly this is fun to play.  Rulebook is dreadful, scenarios can feel a bit samey (in the base + Burnt Offerings at least) cause scenarios come down to find and corner villain and defeat to win, but it is so much fun to grow your character and see what new stuff you can get.

A game with no setting, no atmosphere, and extremely repetitive mechanics. The idea of campaigns and advancement is cute, but in practice, the former are nearly devoid of any story and the latter is slow as hell. 

To make things worse, there's almost no tactic that players can use, as everything you do is dependant on card draws and dice roll, on both of which you have little control. Production is nice, with lots of cards, although the quality of artwork seems sloppy in some instances.

Very luck driven.  There needs to be more relevant decision making during game play. The "decisions" during game play pretty much make themselves.  The only true decisions are what to put in your deck and what skills, powers, etc... to level first.

House-ruled simultaneous turns helps a lot.  Makes the game go much faster and prevents the boredom of downtime between turns.  Might also include a timer in addition to simultaneous turns in order to get players to feel the pressure of real-time decision making and gets player to make mistakes on occasion.

All in all I'd say it's a decent game that is pointed in a good direction, but it needs more to it. Not sure yet if I like the inventory = life total aspect of the game.

RATING: 8
Flip a card.  Roll dice to see if you beat the card.  Repeat.

It's far more fun than it sounds; it distills the essence of many other experience games (AH, etc) to its core elements, and adds the tension of "your deck is your life".

My biggest issue with it is that a terrible combat roll or two early in the game can be a serious setback for the entire table.

[u]The Good[/u]: Uses a brilliant, innovative system of cards that are both functional and packed with theme. Does a good job of simulating some elements of the table-top RPG experience.

[u]The Bad[/u]: Leaves behind the decision-making that comes with table-top gaming. This results in a very, [I]very[/I] thin game with little to no employable strategies.

[u]The Terrible[/u]: There are currently two Printings available for purchase, and these consist of different sized cards. It will be easier, as time goes on, to procure a set all from the same Printing, but when all is said and done, it just might not be worth the effort.

[u]The Bottomline[/u]: This game is missing something on a grand scale. An entire, additional set of rules or objectives maybe. Like it's just laying the foundation for a much more satisfying game to some day wrap itself around.

While the core mechanic of 'flip a card - make a skill check' may seem uninspiring at first glance, it turns out to be a very solid and flexible base mechanic to build a game around.  Each character has their own set of skills and their own strengths and weaknesses, and each challenge has it's own unique mechanics that are both thematic and serve to bring variety to the core mechanic.  Having multiple adventures in an adventure path, multiple scenarios in an adventure, and multiple locations in each scenario makes the game world feel appropriately expansive and, more importantly, expandable.  Each location has it's own small deck of challenges that must be overcome, and the villian and his henchmen are chased from from location to location in each scenario.  It all contributes greatly to capturing the feel of a much larger RPG adventure in a manageable amount of time.  A lot of thought and effort has gone into character progression, and it will take a lot of adventuring to 'max-out' a character.  Fortunately, the adventure path will ultimately be quite massive, and I have no doubt that completing it will bring a true sense of accompolishment.  Highly recommended. 

After a lot of play, I'm raising my rating by half a point.  The more I play it, the more I like it.  This game is right in my wheelhouse, and while not perfect, it's pretty damn close.  I find it more engaging than even LotR LCG or Star Wars LCG, both of which I like.

Played and then had to have. One of the few games I have spent tracking the deliver van to my home - I had a love hate relationship with the Jeff the driver all day. Had not played a rpg for 30 years, so this game represents the best of a rpg and eliminates the worse. The delivery system is card based, but I wouldn't call the game a card game. This is a Role playing game without a gm, so you win or lose. As such is an excellent game, although many of the rules are open to interpretation, it is still unique and without a rival. Would rate higher if I could.

RATING: 7.5
This game has really grabbed me. I've owned it about a month and have played through all available scenarios solo with a three-character party. So far I have played once with friends, and we'll be playing together again soon I'm sure. Although this is a shallow game in terms of strategy, there is a bit more to it than is at first apparent. For example, the decision to fix the built-in "timer" at 30 character turns regardless of the number of characters has a very interesting interaction with the discard-vs.-recharge card play mechanic. (Some cards must be discarded when they are played, some others must be recharged by adding them face-down to the bottom of the character's draw deck. Generally recharging is seen as being greatly preferable to discarding, and the card and character class balance take that into account.) Since a session with six characters likely will give only four or five turns to each character many will never get through their entire deck in order to take advantage of recharges. Why not discard instead? And of course with fewer characters recharging becomes very important. I anticipate finding more strategic subtleties as we play some more.

Component-wise, the box insert is wonderful although if you sleeve your cards (and given how much dang shuffling this game requires, why wouldn't you sleeve?) you'll run out of room quickly. The cards themselves are only okay:  good artwork but spartan design, below average card stock, some color variations between sets, some come wrapped so tightly that they remain bowed until sleeved. The rules are pretty well written but the publisher has had to post to their website numerous errata and clarifications. Let's hope that that type of thing improves with each release.

This is no Mage Knight, and yet I have more hours spent playing this solitaire than I have with Mage Knight. Sometimes a game-as-diversion while you listen to music and unwind from a hard day at work is just the thing you need.

RATING: 7.1
Gyakorlatilag egy kártyás szerepjáték. Annyira nem hasonlít a Thunderstone-ra, mint azt az ember elsőre gondolná. Egyrészt kooperatív, másrészt nagyon-nagyon kocka és egyéb szerencsevezérelt. Szóval inkább egy kártyás Descent. 
Tetszik benne, hogy lehet egy-egy gyors kalandot is nyomni, de hosszútávú karriereket is lehet játszani. Mindeközben fejlődnek a karakterek, tudnak egymással csereberélni stb. Ötletesen egyszerű a harc és az életerő kezelése. A húzópaklid az életerőd is egyben, ha elfogy meghaltál. Természetesen tudják fogyasztani a szörnyek, de fogy a varázslatok tárgyak használatától is, hisz folyamatosan fáradsz az utad során. Szellemes még a recharge azaz, hogy bizonyos lapokat bizonyos esetekben kijátszás után visszatehetsz a húzópaklid aljára, azaz nem fáradsz/sebződsz a használatuktól, ráadásul újra ki is játszhatod majd őket később. Tipikusan ilyenek a varázslatok, amiket megfelelő intelligencia check után vissza lehet pörgetni. 
Nagyon hangulatos még a scenariok összerakása is a helyszínekkel, random cuccokkal.

Node azért volt olyan is, ami nem annyira tetszik. Pl. pont a scenairoknál. Mivel teljesen randomok a kártyák a helyszíneken ezért elég faramuci dolgok tudnak kijönni. Pl. hegyi óriás bujkál a vásár forgatagában. A szerencse szerepe szinte kezelhetetlenül nagy, főleg a kártyasorrendet illetően. Egyszerűen képtelenség megcsinálni egy-egy forgatókönyvet, ha minden főgonosz a paklija aljára kerül. A doboz elsőre nagyon okosan beosztottnak tűnt. Szokás szerint ez addig volt így, amíg nem akartam kártyavédőzni, mert úgy már szinte az alap kártyák se férnek el az insertben, miközben a doboz fele elmegy az üres kiegdobozok majdani tárolására fenntartott helynek. Insane.

Összességében egy jó kis szerepjáték adaptáció kártyára. Ha nem zavar, hogy szinte csak a szerencsén múlik a party sorsa, és bele tudod élni magad a történetbe, akkor nagyon jó kis játék tud lenni. Nekem ez azért nem megy 100%-osan.

-> 6.8

----
Update: Többen azért lényegesen nagyobb a kombózási lehetőség. Szinte minden checket tudunk teljesíteni, csak kérdés, hogy mire mennyit érdemes áldozni. Van mit megbeszélni, kitalálni mindenkinek akár a másik körében is, szóval gyakorlatilag nincs holtidő. Igaz, így meg a sztoriba lehet kevésbé elmerülni, mert nincs nagyon idő helyszínkártyákat olvasgatni.

A lot of fun to play, with a lot of interesting decisions to make. It doesn't have everything a full RPG would, but what it does have is distilled down to the perfect levels. It can be a bit fiddly at times, but overall it plays very smoothly and is quite addictive.

My major complaint lies in how short it is. The base game got us about 8 plays before we were finished. We can start over with new heroes (which we did), but unless we want to drop $20 on another expansion every 4-5 games we're out of luck.

When I first played this game I loved it but with every aditional game I realized that it had several flaws.
- scenarios are too similiar
- not enough cooperation
- not enough planning possible

I even invented my own set of houserules to minimize these effects. (see 'open location variant' in the variant forum) But even with this variant + a new adventure path someone else had constructed it was not interesting enough for a long time.

A fantasy adventure game for 1-6 players that mimics the permanency of a tabletop RPG and clocks in around 60 min per session? Yes, please!

RATING: 8
It's an RPG simulator attempt. It fell flat on my first play, which admittedly, was a bit rushed. But it was basically, go to a location, flip a card, decide if it was worth augmenting a roll to acquire, and roll the required die. To its credit, the game did move, but it was not tense at all. When we were done, we looked at each other and shrugged, saying, "I guess we lost." There was little exciting to me about a game where winning meant finding the right card that was randomly shuffled into a number of decks.

However, after playing the three scenarios of the first campaign out of the box: holy wow. Everything awesome about this game is in: 
A - understanding how to work the rules of the game 

B - leveling your character and adjusting him between scenarios. Then you get completely excited to watch him become better and stronger for the next game. This design is genius in how the character development works.

Long story short: don't judge this game on a single play. Judge it on a series of plays, because where it shines strongest is the character build.

RATING: 8
I was surprised how much I liked this. I went in a little nervous that it would simply feel like a game where you roll dice forever and do skill checks ad infinitum. Funny enough, that is sort of what it is but beyond that there is a sense of visiting different locations, looking for various treasures, friends, and abilities while fighting monsters, henchmen, and villains.  There is variety in how everything plays out and resolves so it keeps you entertained. The graphics are quite good, but are just on the edge of not being great.  There is little ambiguity in the card text but enough holes in the rulebook that things were a bit frustrating during our first game. I am afraid that there's not a lot of room for growth in concept beyond the first few games; and this only scares me because of how many expansions there are. I hope the game can create a sense of growth because I could see myself tiring of it if this was all it had to offer in the end. But for now, there's something very satisfying about playing a scenario out and I'm not sure what more could be done to give players the feeling of an RPG in a card game. Rating may go down some day, but for now it's a high rating.

Pathfinder ACG is a condensed version of the RPG. It excels at capturing the health, items and abilities through a deck builder all within a solo / coop experience. The location decks generally feel unique and thematic. 

The constant dice rolling against checks can get a bit monotonous. Also, the difficulty on this version is a bit on the easy side. Many of the challenges and monsters you can just beat your way through.

Last gripe is that it feels like the players are just playing individual solo games and can't (really) interact much on other players' turns.

It's a great attempt at RPG / Card Game hybrid and look forward to playing many of the different versions.

I started playing the Adventure Path with two of my friends. One of which has wanted to get into RPG's for a long time, and his brother whom loves the Boulder Gate and Dark Souls franchises.  I think they like it.  They wanted to continue, so that's good news.  

I played Amiri, but I traded for Sajan as I thought we would need someone to help with Dexterity. The other two are Seelah and Ezren.  I expect tough times are ahead, unless we find a good way to work together.  All of our characters can individually take down monsters, but need help fighting Villians.  So far we have gotten through Burnt Offerings, and now look forward to Skinsaw Murders.

Innovative co-op deck-builder. Your character deck improves with multiple playthroughs. Only tried solo with expansion characters and it's a bit too fiddly. Some cards and rules are vague/conflicting are this brings the game down quite a bit. Wish it had more choices too.

It started out really fun but then I found each adventure was basically the same. Also, I didn't like the random draws and that the active character didn't have the stats to deal with overcoming it. For example, two party members are in one location and the thief finds a huge monster and has to fight it.  But the barbarian can't help?!? why?

I found that I didn't like deck builder type games, but the theme behind the game itself is great.  This very much feels like those D&D style video games: hero level ups, specializations, and cool equipment.  There is a fair amount of dice rolling, and luck-of-draw, but since you can "stop playing" to prevent losing, it's no big deal to start over if things go wrong.  A nice time filler that won't rack your brain.

RATING: 6
I like it, but don't love it.  I [had] a complete game with every adventure and the character add-on (and even some promo cards).

It's pretty easy, really, and not fun to loose (unlike some better co-operative games.  As a result it really suffers from the alpha gamer problem because there is usually a correct choice.

I only play this game by myself as a result.  If my SO or my friends want to spend several hours playing a game, it seems like a waste to pull this out.

Especially when it takes so long to set up.  

Don't get me wrong, it's good.  But it's a really big game of solitaire at the end of the day.  Also, the inability to predict what types of cards will emerge for matching with character abilities is a big game design problem, ESPECIALLY for a cooperative game.  Once again, I play alone with only two characters.

At first, I really liked this game with my SO.  If does tell an interesting story, and I could see it being the perfect game for someone.  It's just not enough game for me (despite coming in a rather large box)

Hard to stop playing after one mission. Sure, gameplay is ULTRA light, and there's very little there if you dig down deep, and it's pretty fiddly to figure out all your bonuses and exactly which dice you are rolling.

Ingenious design of blending my interest in two types of games I love - D&D and deck building/card games.  At times I'd love to see less randomness of what is included per the setting of the scenario.  Overall I really like the sense of adventure and nhow the dice are used to keep the possibility of succeeding or failing exciting.

I really do not know how I feel about this game.  It could go way up, or way down.  I have the whole first cycle adventure packs and feel no compulsion to own more.

I love the campaign system, leveling and item deck construction.  I anticipate seeing huge numbers of copy cats from here on in.  That said... the game itself is a straightforward flip up a card and encounter system, with a skill check generally involved.  I'm ok with that, but this first cycle has had way too many base scenario "hunt the henchman" scenarios.  It's a huge missed opportunity, I think you could do something special with this system with better scenarios.

That said, this game is never going to provide brain busting decisions, nor is it intended too.  The question is if it has just enough decisions to stay interesting---it's a game that you can idly play while talking with someone and that is not necessarily a bad thing.

RATING: 9
As a solo game, this is awesome. As a cooperative game, it's just good. It has way too many pointy rules, and even after a few games other people have trouble with some of the vocabulary and effects. 

But all of the fun is in building up your character. If you're looking for a tough challenge, this isn't the game for you. The exciting parts are finding new items, adding new spells to your deck. It's the same fun as ordering a box of new games in real life. Getting new stuff is enjoyable, and that's what makes this game enjoyable.

RATING: 9
Somewhere between a coop, a deckbuilder, and a dungeon crawl ... in that order. Heals, blessings, item swapping, and the ability to split up and stake out make this a coop at heart. Deckbuilding happens over multiple games, but the slow changes noticeably improve characters. Finally, it feels like a dungeon crawl with fewer creative possibilities but still with a healthy amount of immersion.

Good game with some nice mechanisms. I especially like the idea of scenarios describing, locations needed, who themselves describe type cards needed, which creates a lot of variation. But on the other hand, this variation causes that there is only very little strenghtening of monsters and obstacles throughout adventure pathes since only a few of them are scaling. Here I would have liked to have scaling dangers of more heavy dangers in later adventures. So from the basic ideas a really good game, but unfortunately not convincing to the last details which would have make a superb game.

Hi, my name is THEME and I do not appear in this game in any tangible, relateable way. Thanks for your concern, but I'm not here. Please look elsewhere.
Yes, it's true. It looks like THEME is here. It looks that way on the box. The PATHFINDER brand name alone represents potential theme, and the basic substance of that theme is, in fact, here. But after you open the lid, set up the game and take your first action, the theme lies on it's side, heaves it's last breath and promptly dies like a Christmas puppy wrapped in a gift box with no air holes.
"Dear God! That's just horrible!" you're saying.
I know! How do you think I feel?
How can they get so close to creating a world class dungeon crawl and yet so terribly miss the mark?

Other than thematic puppy-cide, the game actually works.
And that may be the reason for all the hype. 
Its mechanics flow in a well designed card game that shows you how well a card game...can...be...designed.
But that's all it does.
Although, it does it very well. 
Characters that level up and gain new abilities each time you play? WORKS.
New equipment, spells, and monsters to face in each new upgrade pack? WORKS.
Combat options and choices that could leave your character and all you worked for dead? Yep. WORKS.
 
I like that it works. It works so well, that my son and I played this game over and over. I've bought expansions for it. I bought additional characters. Why? 
Because.
I'm a collector? I like expansions? I have disposable income?
Okay, it's none of your business why.
Just- because, that's why.
Leave me alone.
 
I keep thinking I'll introduce this game to some of my other board game friends, but I never do.
I love what the designers set out to do with this game, and I hate that it ultimately DOESN'T WORK.
There are rave reviews out there, but this game isn't what it pretends to be. It's an effective, well designed card game with a sliver of theme just like Dominion, but lacking that game's depth, replayability, and strategy.
Maybe some future expansions will fix the theme issue, but by that time, you could have learned to played Descent, or any other dungeon crawler, or even the real Pathfinder game. Of course, then you'd be a nerd, and all wrapped up in the role-playing culture, standing around Comic-Con in your underwear calling it cos-play.
And we can't have that now, can we?
It's weird. I love it, but I can't recommend it.
Sorry, guys.

The idea is clever — maybe more clever for the publisher looking for a line extension than for the players wanting an RPG card game — but no matter, as this is a quality production that I think will earn its share of fans. What Paizo has done is to repurpose their Rise of the Runelords art for a cooperative fantasy card game that uses quasi-Pathfinder mechanics to quasi-reproduce the events and adventures of their Runelords Adventure Path.

The result is a polished-if-mechanical exercise in flipping cards and rolling dice, with a little bit of RPG flavor filtering in via table talk and rationalizations about what is happening (“That dog pissed on my leg at the waterfront!”). S’okay. The clever bit is that this is a sort of slow-motion deck-building game, with character decks and abilities evolving over a continuing campaign … but after playing it twice last night, I’m not sure I see myself playing this game often enough to explore its secrets, so I haven't rated it here (my gut is that it rates a "6," but more play might bump that number).

With simple card mechanics most of the character's D&D pathfinder's abilities are implemented. 

I think that most of the fun comes from playing the campaign and building the character rather than the game itself that, while challenging on occasion, may not otherwise hold enough interest in the long run. 

Would I buy this? Only if I had a regular group of players who would like to do all the campaign. Lacking that I'd see no use in a game such as this one. Yet again, I had good fun playing it.

Nothing to say. I don't like the mechanics. Can't get into it.

Writing on cards is unthinkable for me. I hate the idea of just rolling a dice (albeit with modifiers) to see if I kill a creature or not.  My favourite game (the Hunters) uses this exact mechanic and I love it, but in Pathfinder I just hate it for some reason.

Oh well I have ordered Legendary Encounters Aliens so maybe that will fill the spot that Pathfinder failed to.

I am not fond of cooperative games, but this system works really well. You have your own personal deck, but can still help your fellow heroes. The rules are simple to understand (with a player aid from BGG, because the rulebook is very confusing)) and it is easy to set up and pack down for continuation another day.

I am really impressed with the box, because it has been designed to include the entire game, including 7 expansions in one single place with easy access to everything. Brilliant!

Having finished the game (35 scenarios) I found it a tad too easy, so we will houserule our next adventure to include an additional Location.

Hey! Look, a Diablo card game! How creative! NOT!

This game is just about rolling dice and killing monsters, really nothing else to do. No decisions, no real story, no fun like Magic the Gathering or Dixit or 7 Wonders (albeit that last one has a very short life).

If you like rolling dice to kill zillions of ennemies with no real story, this might be your game. Although, if you like power gaming, you will be disappointed since character improvement is minimal and on top of that, you lose equipment once you use a card... which is stupid. I mean, if I find a good sword, I'll use it in every combat, not just one and then it's gone. LOL

The mechanics are simplistic but crappy to my taste. Magic the Gathering is so much better albeit a bit more expensive on the long run.

It also have lots of small rules that reminds me of Arkham Horror (which is so much more fun to play) but without the story-like game play.

Don't buy this unless you have played it a couple of times... ah! hells, what am I saying? Just don't buy this, it's made for a quick buck!

Limited to the scenarios and adventures on top of that! Yes, it's a scenario driven card game, one of the worse ideas and combo you can get.

You would have to pay me to get this game, no way I'm going to pay even one copper coin for that one.

Es un juego de cartas, deckbuilder, con mucho material para expandir (pero no es un LCG), que plantea un argumento de aventuras "espada y brujeria". 

La caracteristica diferenciadora de Pathfinder es que originalmente era un juego de rol, y esta es su conversion a juego de cartas, pero manteniendo simultaneamente la mayor parte de la jugabilidad y desarrollo del personaje del juego de rol. Por ello en el juego se utilizan dados multifaceta (de 8, 10, 12, 20 caras) proponiendo un punto de encuentro entre juego de rol y deckbuilder. 

Todo ello lo consigue. el juego es rico, variado y desafiante. 

Donde en mi opinion el juego falla, es en el argumento. El juego es un seguidor de las tematicas clasicas (D&D, ESDLA, warhammer, etc) pero no es ninguna de esas "grandes licencias"... y el juego lo que hace, es clonar todo lo clonable de aquellas, y no ofrecer practicamente nuevo a todo ello. Es "espada y brujeria" super generico y no ofrece (o no he visto que ofrezca) nada novedoso o diferente en ello. 

En consecuencia, yo la sensacion que tuve jugando, fue estar jugando a un clon de D&D/ESDLA "sin chicha". no encontré la propuesta del juego inmersiva, y por ello pasó sin pena ni gloria durante la tarde y en mi pensamiento. 

Probablemente merezca una segunda partida por mi parte.

I was overexpecting it. The character development is not that good. In my opinion one of the reasons maybe because the game does't include money mechanism.

As an old RPGer turned boardgamer this was immensely fun. And there is something engaging about the whole setup. Both trying to find and defeat the main villain of each scenario as well as getting new boons and leveling up your character. The only negative I can find is that the leveling seems to be a little slow in the early scenarios. In most RPGs levelling is (much) faster at the start of a character's life and here levelling seems to be constant throughout the adventure path.

Oh, and it's the first game in a long time that my wife repeatedly asks for & therefor has reached the 'dime' status within a month of first play, quarter within 6 months and half-century within a year!

Fun rpgish card game.  I like the character decks and stats changing and improving over the life of the game.  It does feel just a tad bit on the light side, but that can quickly be overcome with a group that gets into role playing and storytelling.

Was lukewarm after my first play but really had a great time the second game.

RATING: 7
This is a really interesting take on the cooperative D&D genre of board games.  Although it does not stray far from its roots mechanically, it does strip out many of the mechanics and thematic elements which make a lot of these games pretty tedious.  For example, movement is completely abstracted, and combat does not have any tactical component.  A pretty robust party building and character/equipment building game is still there using the typical fantasy tropes.  You want to assemble a party with a rogue to deal with traps, a fighter to kill monsters, and then you need to work together to delve through these different dungeons and find the villain.  

I was very much surprised and had a much better time than I expected playing this game.  We played the suggested basic scenario with the suggested basic decks and still had a good time.  I suspect with expansions improving the card mix and adding more interesting adventures, plus the possibility of campaign style play, this could grow to an 8 rating.

Pathfinder: Rise of the Runelords finally delivers on a deckbuilding game with a campaign system. Ever since Dominion, this kind of thing has seemed like a natural fit. But games like Descent 2nd Edition and Mage Knight really just added a minor deckbuilding element to an adventure game instead of making it the focus. While Pathfinder’s the quick playing time and prosaic scenarios don’t allow for strong thematic integration, the mechanics themselves provide real drama as players work together, take risks, and (occasionally) suffer crushing defeat. 

 This is a game that you have to commit to. If you aren’t willing to buy all the expansions, you really aren’t getting the whole game. And that’s a big financial outlay. Yet for the amount of content, it is pretty reasonable. Every scenario has a unique villain and many of the henchman are only used in a single scenario as well. New cards are added and removed all the time so your encounters have great variety. And seeing a coveted item appear creates brutal choices about whether to put resources into getting it (you may never see it again) or to focus on winning the scenario at hand. Those kinds of metagame-centered choices are the heart of this game, and are really only possible when each scenario is considered in the context of the overall adventure path. 

As cooperative games go, it is not challenging enough (losses are sporadic and death is even rarer). As deckbuilders go, there is none of the engine-building or combo potential that often exists (players have little control over what specific cards they acquire). As pseudo-RPGs go, there isn’t enough thematic integration (players can find an aquatic monster in a farmhouse or defeat a person with a lock pick). And yet in spite of all of that, this game hits a sweet spot for me of accessibility combined with the fun of progressing a character and adventuring as a team.  It’s as addicting as it is delightful.

RATING: 5.5
Fun because it's co-op even though the mechanics are flawed and the game is almost entirely "see what happens" card flipping. Proof of the power of co-oppery.

RATING: 6
I love the idea of a card-based cooperative campaign game. When this was released I expected it to be one of my favorite games of all time. The problem is: building the locations is laborious and the only thing cooperative about this game is that you're all sitting at the same table bored.

Like this game a lot.  Soloing with about 3 characters works well.  My first campaign through I could not beat the boss at the end.  Not sure how much another time through would feel different.  Different character classes might make it fresh again.

RATING: 6
I've played the intro adventure twice now and I'm going to initially rate this game as a 6.  I'm not a huge fan of card drafting games and this is not one of the better ones. My main complaint is the extremely unfriendly to new players rulebook.  Myself and two other new players attempted to play without any guidance and missed all kinds of things that should have been explained better.

Wow.. i usually like ameritrash.. but this one.. way too much fluff & no game.. i see how this can be very appealing for many, because of the "leveling up" & the co-op nature.. but for one i don't like co-ops because i usually figure out the best way to beat the "system" and then either we do it that way & win or everyone does his thing and we'll win 50/50.. so boring..

No real strategy just optimization..

And this is Rank 53 after just 6 months..! Man am i not represented on BGG..

I like this game. The first play through is fun and with the extra decks it is rather long. I'm not that sure about replayability. It suffers a little as then you know what is coming, but using different characters you can get a different game feel. If you want a light "RPG" feel then this is just right. Also players playing their own characters prevents (mostly) the alpha gamer problem which is a problem often with co-ops. 

I haven't tried the class decks so can't say anything about them. Have played with Character add-ons and that was good addition. Do the class decks override them, I don't know.

RATING: 7
I've been happily surprised by this game (even if I bought it in the know, after viewing Rahdo's runthrough of it). I'm usually not too happy about dices and luck choosing my path for me, but rolling forsuccess is partly mitigated here by your ability to add more dice (for a higher chance of success) by adding equipment,casting spells, getting help from a friend or a God. When I play solo, I give myself one home-made rule: blessings can add they die AFTER rolling ('cause having a d12 in a roll is still enormously random, even if it's supposed to represent your character's forte, and I don't like being that susceptible to bad luck).
I'm a big fan of growing my character through "slow, long-term" deck building, and through the extra XP gains. (I don't like the idea of writing anything on my cards, though.)

I've barely started trying to get friends into it, so this opinion will get revised once they've had a chance to play twice or more.

UPDATE: Unfortunately, it seems the strategy doesn't vary much for this game, and although the settings, difficulty of monsters and power of the loot vary, the missions are almost always the same, and I feel like I'm replaying the same game over & over. Thus downgraded opinion.

A gem in my collection.


Game/Expansion/Promo 384 in my collection.

Solid and confident 10 for solitaire play.
I'm....addicted.
Set-up and playtime are not overly demanding and if the workday was a bearable beast, weeknight games are realistically manageable. 
Really, this a quite a fun game for the solitaire gamer in me.

As opposed to something like my LotR LCG, there's dice and no fiddly tokens. It's appreciated that everything needed to track life, modifiers, etc, is based on the cards.

Since my first D&D character, Fitzgerald the cleric, I've been a cleric fan. So, choosing Kyra was a must.  Then I went with Amiri for brute strength.  I tried running with Seoni, but the traps in Poison Pill were killing me. Kyra just couldn't get past them.  So I took out Seoni and tried Merisiel.  I'm enjoying her abilities a lot more. 

Someday I will need to go back and try soloing the other characters and attempt to get them up to speed with my thrilling trio.

10-27-13:
I've since begun running Ezren, Harsk, and Lem and 
am having difficulty beating Black Fang.
Ezren and Lem are quickly becoming two of my favorite heroes to play.

11-3-13
The Ezarskem trio seems to be more enjoyable than my Kyramiresiel girl-group.  
Well, I could probably lose Harsk and not have a problem (sorry, Harsk).  
There's a lot of fun casting spells with both the wizard and the halfing.  The little guy is holding up his end of battles with the little bludgeoning sling, but he has since upgraded to a crossbow (Ezren carries one and the dwarf wields two).

I've tried it a couple of times now, and beyond the flavor it doesn't seem to offer a lot. The choices have little meaning, and the game almost runs itself. You could say the deck building is a meaningful choice, and that's true, but very little time is spent on that compared to playing out the result.

Really enjoy this game. Loving the campaign style progression and deck building, though the scenarios and per-turn progression are a bit repetitive, and co-op between characters is fairly limited. Could use a bit more loot variety too. Also gets a bit expensive with all the adventure decks and other (optional) decks.

RATING: 7
I "leveled up" the pool after a few scenarios... Once we opened the third adventure deck, I took all the Base cards out so that we would randomly draw things that matched the difficulty of the game (for example, lvl 1 or 2 weapons and armor instead of the base stuff). It made a big difference and didn't unbalance the game (bc some shit was so hard, like the final battle in the clock tower of the third adventure pack).

I bought PACG to play solitaire, and unfortunately, it fell flat for me compared to other solo games I like. The decisions the game presents you with are mostly either obvious or not very important. It's more a game where you observe what happens, than one where you actively affect the outcomes. 

It's a shame, because there are lots of things I still like about the game:

* Your character can evolve between games and gain new powers, or update his/her attributes. This creates a good feeling of being on an actual long term adventure.

* Cards for your deck are acquired through playing as opposed to simply selecting them from a common pool like you do in LotR LCG, for example. This, like the previous point, really contributes to the game feeling like an adventure, and it also makes each card you acquire more salient in your mind. 

* The different barriers (obstacles to overcome that are not monsters) usually have different ways to be handled depending on whether your character excels in magic, acrobatics, endurance, etc.

* The different ways you can use cards -- burying under you character, discarding, recharging by putting at the bottom of your deck, banishing into the box, etc. -- seem to offer lots of possibilities to make the game more decision heavy and is a great mechanic.

* Another nice mechanic is your deck serving as your hit points. It's an interesting balancing act and I really like it.

* The stylized artwork is quite fresh unlike that of most fantasy games that take themselves too seriously.

* The adventures and adventure paths that give you a feel of continuity and being part of a story.

Even with all these great things, there is just not enough game here for me. My major gripes with PACG:

* The flip-and-roll mechanics quickly grew stale for me. This is something that could've perhaps been remedied by varied and complex card effects, but the card effects usually have to do with adding more dice to your roll, which makes them feel uninteresting and repetitive. Even the different ways in which you can use cards that I mentioned in my list of likes, differ primarily in how much you add to your roll.

* The way the scenarios are constructed -- out of all cards with variation only in the locations, villain and henchmen -- makes the scenarios feel samey. Contrast this with some of the quests in LotR LCG where there are different stages in which the objectives and rules change, and which can feel very different.

I really wanted to like PACG, but ultimately decided it doesn't work for me and traded it away. It is a good attempt at making a thematic, RPG-like, adventure card game, but it falls short in the gameplay department.

This is a good game for me to get my D&D dice chucking fix but it is not the game I thought it would be. It is repetitive and there really is not much of a story to it. Either way, I like D&D and wish this gave more of a D&D feel to the experience than what it actually does.

I own all the current available character class decks. I don't think I would rate this as highly without the additional character class decks. If I were to rate the base game alone, I would probably give it a 7.

However, with the character class decks the enjoyment of this game skyrockets. I have some issues with the base game on how the monsters don't scale well and I would like to see more engaging monsters that are super effective to fire, cold, poison etc so the weapons with those traits actually matter. I hope they will address these issues in the future base sets and I am sure I would rate them a 10!

Card games are not my favorite kind of game by a long shot, but this one would be my favorite so far.  It's less abstract than others I have played.  It is not an RPG by any means though it doesn't claim to be.  My biggest issue with it is the ridiculous rule that two characters in the same location can't directly help each other fight a monster.

這款是我目前最愛的角色扮演遊戲，我還為它做了珍珠版內盒+牌架，支援1~6玩家，我愛可以solo的合作遊戲，不怕找不到咖，而且節奏明快，還可以隨時存檔，過關之後的能力/技能獎勵很有龍與地下城的味道，自組角色牌庫也是很棒的設計，這遊戲玩起來很像組隊一起打怪/打寶，因為是卡牌設計的關係有非常多的怪物/裝備，玩過深入絕地後我個人還是偏愛這款，雖然我覺得它還有很多的進步空間，我也期待可以玩到更棒的角色扮演遊戲。
遊戲設計時的測試做得不夠，導致釋出後頻頻修改規則書與Q&A，甚至有些是需要修改卡片的，看第二盒所做的修改就知道了，其實第一盒是beta版...
期待數位版的推出，應該可以省去許多設置/洗牌時間，猶豫了許久，我決定還是先把它賣給有緣人了...
更新:過了一年半，還是收了全套連角色擴，現在有空就找同事們開團，索性不中文化直接啃英文，也是玩得蠻開心，那就往全破邁進了!

Great artwork and an interesting take on gm-less rpg's. Can sometimes be a chore to setup/teardown, but what makes it worth it is the character customization you take on. You don't know how useful you'll be with the party you're in until you get into it, and when it's over (which takes some time to do so) you'll want to start over and try new characters. 

Replayability is generated by the feeling that there's more to experience when you play with other characters.

This Game is absolutely what it said to be. I really like the variety of play and the complete idea behid the whole game setup, locations, adventures, adv. Paths and hunting the villain.

Only thing i think could be better "called" is the "closing location" feature. Its hard to imagine how you really "close" a location, the rule itself is unlucky explained, but after a little browsing everything is fine, and the mechanic makes sense, like everything else.

Also its the first game i know you can play solo AND keep and level your character from game to game until he/she dies.

It feels like an Online MMORPG, where you visit dungeons.

Truely awesome, a very good job and a good path for the future of board gaming, its really a pathfinder in that case.

This game doesn't have any story behind it. I was hoping at least for reasons why to hunt down these villains, nope. It's nostalgic for people who played through the Pathfinder Adventure paths, because it has all the same NPC's but if you haven't played through those, and aren't in love with Paizo and Pathfinder, this offers little other than repetitive flipping of cards where some are good and some are bad. 

This game already exists as either Lord of the Rings the Card Game or Elder Sign. This is basically a similar game with the "Pathfinder" theme tacked on, and if you aren't in love with that Theme, this isn't going to do much for you.

Descent 2 - does loads more for delivering a story, and getting players motivated to keep adventuring.

Well got a play in with 5 players, first off, NOT my idea playing with 5, to me this is a 2 to 4 player game with 3 probably best. 5 works well enough mechanically (though why did the designer choose to NOT scale the timer for any number other than 4, ball drop!?) but it becomes too long and though you CAN interact when not your turn, it still feels like downtime to me. 

I did not think the theme was all that strong here, other than the characters having their own unique powers and a couple things like that, just did not get a feel for a story developing for sure. I guess some flavour text, while being the weakest form of theme integration, would of actually been very suitable and helpful here considering this is supposed to be a card game version of a RPG. (not an RPG by any stretch)

Basically all my thoughts below did not change especially in my 3rd edit, due to watching the videos it played exactly as I expected, so still torn, also. Owning Warhammer Quest I am not sure I need a game like this, as playing this just makes me want to play the better version with WHQ, however, they are probably different enough. I think the thing that bothers me the most out of the 3 big negatives below is the repetition, much like Castle Ravenloft the simplicity while being a "Pro" in one sense, is also its biggest weakness. I would just like to see something mechanically other than flip a card, and do a skill check, maybe expansions could spice it up somewhat, or fan-made houserules if not, but I think flipping a card and rolling every turn is going to get old REALLY fast for me.   

===================

Damn, I got all excited until I seen DB co-op game, which also sounds a little like co-op Thunderstone. I do wonder if there are enough differences, and if the D&D/RPG elements and theme could still suck me in. The mini-charts on the cards ruin the art and look of the card somewhat, maybe its still the best way though

Edit - Watched the first game play video, its mostly like  Gloom of Kilforth for a comparison, with just a touch of Thunderstone and LOTR-LCG. Though it plays very differently, it fits in the same slot as Ravenloft/Drizzt series. Probably not RPG-ish enough for me, too much "go here, see what is there, and then roll a die and see what happens", rinse, repeat until game ends (that is all there is actually, but at the end you make a couple choices on what cards to keep in your deck for next game aka "leveling" if you win). Decisions look too straight-forward, and it seems no bigger story developing so likely going to pass. 

The best part of the game does look to be the aspect similar to Mage Knight, where leveling means you improve your deck, MK is much more of a game than this one from what I see though. 

Edit 2 - There could be more story here developing than was shown in the first video, at least when you consider playing a campaign. LOTR-TCG's theme really gets overshadowed by the mechanics for me (only played twice however), so I will hope theme comes through more here. The main draw for me here is the campaign aspect, and leveling characters, and as an old-time D&D/RPG player it might just suck me in yet. I still think WHQ (with houserules) is leagues above this one, but this looks pretty easy to set up and play in comparison. Should watch a more in-depth video or better yet, play it

Edit 3 - Watched a couple more vids. Looks very well done overall, fairly thematic and D&D-like (for a card game) and potentially addictive kind of fun as you want to level/improve your character (something not enough other games have done). Negatives are the big dose of luck, highly repetitive/lack of variation, and decisions are pretty minimal (Last two bother me the most) 

Very torn, those are some big negatives, yet there is a 'draw' there for me with my tastes/background for sure. Likely a 6 for me if there was no campaign system, and maybe a 7 with it, borderline for a purchase for me.

Interesting, can see that there is some fun in this.  First play felt a little bit like Resident Evil (character) with Flash Point (problem solving).  With a tiny bit of roleplaying, glad I didn't buy this but happy to play it.  I think that the group makes this game, like many, as it could easily be quite processional but we are having fun.

This is the game that fully pushed me into board gamedom.  I very much enjoy the relationship you develop with your character(s) and the sense of progression that you get from that.

Game does scale towards easy.  Scenarios aren't as varied as they could have been.

RATING: 5
(Comment made when only the base set, 1st adventure, and character add-on are available. 5 plays.)

This is a decently fun, light, adventure game. Not as brain taxing or rewarding of cleverness as LotR LCG, but fun in a beer-and-pretzels way. One aspect that is really fun are the persistent character decks across subsequent games. The RPG aspect of "here's a pile of loot, who wants what?" has been captured very nicely here.

So far the adventures are very straight forward. Chase a villain around and trap him. More variation is supposedly coming, but we don't know the details of that yet.

There is a high luck factor here. If the villains and his henchmen float to the top of their respective decks, you'll have a much easier time than if they all hide at the bottom. There are a lot of dice rolls, and many instances where you're pulling a random monster from among all possible monsters.

The main decisions to make revolve around the blessing and ally cards. These usually give you two choices for their use: help a character defeat an enemy or help the party get to the villain faster (and you are on a turn clock). The game distills some key RPG concepts with a very simple combat system, and grafts that onto a press-your-luck card game.

Go into it looking for a fun monster smash, and you'll probably find it. Especially if you're a sucker for adventure games like I am. Go into it looking for the complexity and rewarding gameplay of Magic Realm, LotR,  or even Mage Knight and you'll probably be disappointed.

This game is quite easy to learn and play. There's a ton of cooperative interaction with 2 players. Setup takes 10 minutes or so and gameplay takes 45 - 60 minutes, but overall that's still a short game.

I like that treasures or other rewards are actually hard to come by. For example, playing through one scenario *might* yield only one item or weapon that's good enough to replace what your character has already.

RATING: 5
For me, it's a game with mostly obvious choices and relatively few meaningful decisions.

The components are OK - card text a bit small, rulebook makes hard work of explaining some simple concepts, but easily solved by the various play-aids. 

I like the adventure theme and I like cards and dice - and the expansions may well turn this into something more compelling - but I'm not waiting for that.

RATING: 5
Update: Too samey. We're midways in Burnt Offerings, with little incentive to play again.

--------------------
Update: Played it with my 8 year old son, and we both liked it a lot. The three intro scenarios were dead easy, but hopefully Burnt Offerings will present a bit more of a challenge (or perhaps playing with just two characters is just easy-peasy). Thematically, the game's not really that strong, but rolling dice to defeat monsters and getting lovely new gear is fun all the same.

--------------------
Interesting and entertaining. A little cumbersome mechanically (particularly when playing solo), but good fun all the same. I love the idea of character progression. Here's hoping that future scenarios will see a lot of variety - special rules, different victory conditions, etc.

Felt like more of a game of co-op solitaire than anything. Move somewhere, flip a card over and hope it doesn't kill you. The theme is somewhat lost on the gameplay.

I'm not a huge fan of the cards as HP mechanic as sometimes it just feels bad to use items as it's almost like taking a hit and sometimes taking some damage can really screw you over.

RATING: 6
Great awesome game…….in design. The mechanics of the game is truly great, and the idea of everyone getting together and playing together without a game master is really awesome.  But though there is a variety of things in this game they feel the same with just different numbers.  You quickly feel like your fighting a number 13, not the monster your fighting. And the scenarios don't feel to different from one to the other.  I have every expansion, and there were very few times that the villains and Henchmen seemed different from on to the other….but the ones that did, the missions were really cool.
This is a weird game, because i can say I love the game, I love the art, the theme, the game play…but yet i just don't want to take it out as often as it was designed to be done.  And I think that is the problem, the game is a few times of game play, but the 30 times playing it isn't as fun.  I hope this Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hyde review makes since.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2013)

I like card games, lately I have delved into, Mage Wars, Android: Netrunner, Call of Cthulhu LCG and Star Wars LCG, so it is no wonder that I like this game. I thought I wasn’t going to like it because it is a CoOp game, but I did. Perhaps, I need to review my opinion of LOTR LCG, another CoOp game I had no intention of playing before :D (and they are so close in the BGG´s ratings right now).

On the plus side, the fantasy setting is great, I love the way the scenarios are stacked on, they really told a story. You can customize your deck, The game is easily expandable (as shown by the huge box). The rules are easy to grasp and the gameplay is fast paced. 

On the bad side, the art could have been a lot better, it is adequate but subpar IMO. The setup can be a little annoying for some people (not me) and by far, my main complaint, it is way too easy with 2 players. I think with 4 players the game can be harder BUT I don’t really want to play it with 4 players (due to the downtime), perhaps with 3. I hope there is an official way to play with a harder difficulty setting. I have not read the rules yet, but I will to look for it. I’m not sure about the replayablity factor here, and that’s the main reason I have not bought the game. I would not want to play the same scenario over and over.

Bottom line, a good game that I want to play soon. I will probably buy it, but I’m not sure about the replay factor. I didn’t knew about Pathfinder before this game. As the game is kind of light, I’m not sure it will stand the test of time for me, but right now I’m loving it.

As it turned out, we were playing a wrong rule making the game much more easy. Next game we will play with the correct set of rules. My main complaint about the game was that it was too easy with 2 players, hopefully this fixes it as I really don´t want to play this with more than 2-3 players (more that that and I begin to feel the downtime).

I’m enjoying our plays of Pathfinder.

I hate that the game manual doesn’t list an EXACT list of components, that’s the minimum I expect in all my games. Around 500 hundred cards is not acceptable when you buy the game second hand and you need to review if it is complete.

It’s been a long time since I last played Pathfinder. It seems the group I used to play Pathfinder has been dissolved and I sold my copy of the game. I’m not sure I want to start the adventure again with another group because I would lost my character, due to this I’m downgrading its rating. I still consider it a good game and I would like to finish the story but Pathfinder is a one shot game.

I was thinking about buying the game again because I wanted to play through the scenarios. Fortunately an iPad app came this month and it is great!! (although it killed the tabletop version for me. For sure I won’t buy it again). I already bought all the scenarios on the iPad and I already finished up to The Skinsaw Murders, I’m waiting for the developer to release the next scenarios. The campaign mode is very addictive and that’s why I really like Pathfinder.

Completed the Adventure path. I thought this was a game that I would love based upon the them and my first few solo gameplays. Sadly, it isn't. I don't really feel that drawn into the theme but that, perhaps, could be solved by playing with others (but then why not play a pre role-playing game). I never felt that I was in a location. There are some interesting choices in which adventurers to assign to which locations and when to play specific cards to provide aid but, in general, I am less than enthusiastic about this game. It's rating kept falling as I played it. I broke it out to play it out every once in a while but there are a lot of other solo-able games I prefer. Now that I'm done, I see no reason to try other adventure paths.

This goes onto my short list of all-time favorite games. I love the RPG aspect of it. I love that my characters stats improve from game to game and that my characters cards improve from game to game. I thoroughly enjoy playing this game solo and with friends. The only caveat is that they do not offer replacement cards, so I had to find a way to mark my character's upgrades without actually modifying the cards.

This is basically a dungeon crawler where you can level your character up over a number of expansions.

Very interesting. Pen/Paper RPG-like style card adventure game... Lately, I just want to chuck dices, so I am debating hard inside to whether or not to grab this game. 

Still deciding. It's just that for me, having only cards to play RPG seems so weird. I want to hold minis, and move them around when I am playing RPGs.

I am still torn after watching this game for a long time. It feels like...I would rather play computer RPG rather than this. I play Path to Exile & Diablo...do I need a simplified card version of those games?

RATING: 6
This is a pretty fun co-op card game. I prefer the actual gameplay of LoTR Card Game but could do without the deck construction. The gameplay here is pretty basic. However, the main element this has going for it is the ability to built your character over time. It really captures the spirit of RPGs and games such as WoW and Diablo whereby you're constantly wondering if the next "drop" will give you something rare and wonderful. Without that it would be a pretty mundane experience. In fact, the rest of the game can feel a bit like the grind in WoW.

Not the best game in the world but definitely has a place in my collection.

[Update] Wow, the setup and tear-down is becoming really tiresome. Plus - more worryingly - it's becoming pretty boring; flip card, roll die, repeat. Most of the weapons do the same thing and there's virtually no decisions to make... AT ALL.

Includes: Very cool card playing and deck-evolving mechanics. Very nice building block for your own stories!

As well as having players have more interaction.

Big thanks for Paizo and Mike to give me this RPGish experience. I see that this will have massive amount of plays in our group!

No boardgame has ever given our group as high tension and adrenaline rush as this one. Some of the scenarios we have gone through have been soooo damn close to stop in a smoking pile of rubble, but no, we somehow managed to pull it through at the last possible moment. Marvellous!

2014-11-15 - I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Yes, on the surface, it seems light on decisions, but there's a bit more to it when you get into it. The tensions arises from the fact that your deck is your health, and if you ever run out of cards, you're dead. So, do you discard that card to use its ability or buff your power? Or do you hang on to it and risk discarding even more when you take damage? It's a good system. I'd play again.

2015-11-10 - I'm dropping my rating from a 7 to a 6, not because there's anything wrong with the game, just because my interest in playing it has waned a bit.

If you're willing to tolerate occasional thematic oddities (a Hill Giant on a boat or a Collapsed Ceiling in the woods) and situational quirks in the mechanics (contradictory or impossible card interactions), this is a very enjoyable game. It tells a story and provides an adventure feel as well as cards alone can. If you want to scratch the RPG itch without appointing a dungeon master, preparing an adventure beforehand, or setting up a more complex dungeon crawl game, this is a solid way to go. The story gets progressively darker, which diminished the enjoyment a bit for me; and it runs perhaps a bit too long. Don't get me wrong--it's a fun game, but by the end of the final adventure, I was happy to be done.

I love Pathfinder, but I'm surprised at how well rated this game is.  After about 5 games, I was ready to put this one away for good.

Essentially you turn over a card. it gives you a number to beat using a specific (or multiple) stat(s), and you roll a die against that number to see if you can beat it.  The only "strategy" that comes into play is whether another character blesses the roll or not.  Seriously, that's pretty much it.   

Keep the TV on during this game, as a lot of players will be sitting around waiting. . .

Super super fun the first time I tried it. The second time however, it was very boring. The game doesn't own any replay value. The rule book is crappy, so wait for a second edition.

The game has a fun mechanism that was rushed through production too fast.

This games grows after the first play, which is the opposite of what I would have expected from the repetative nature of flipping cards and reacting to them.

Played it with role players: they said the preferred true role playing games. Played it with board gamers: they said they preferred boardgames with more meaningful choices. Played it solo: felt it was too easy and repetitive.

This is a board game that lets you flip a card and then roll a few dice to acquire or beat that card. Over and over and over and over again. Yes, the game gives you a campaign and characters to develop if you want to invest the money to buy all the adventure expansions. The game gets repetitive pretty fast and for the money you would need to invest to get the complete game you can buy several better games.

You have a hand of cards made up of various weapons, armor, and spells, blessings, items, and allies. You go through stacks of cards to fight and add new cards to your hand. You are in different locations, but can help each other by playing certain cards or using special abilities. This seemed odd since you are not in the same place. Also you need to randomly select cards to your hand limit. This means you have good stuff with you, but it is random what you can use. Then there is the randomness of the dice rolling, but by working together we seemed to be able to roll more dice than needed. Yet after all of those weeknesses there was some fun in beating monsters or villains and in collecting new cards. It was the progrssion and teamwork which made this fun. I just think dungeon crawling games still have so much more potential.

I've been playing this game on the app recently and have been having fun with it.  The game itself is fairly simple but is nevertheless engaging to build up your character. With that said, this isn't a game that I would build a marathon around as I prefer to play it in spurts.

Update: After playing through all scenarios, I have to admit my feeling on this game has dropped considerably.  While the game mechanics are fun in spurts, the scenario design is bland, dull and at times frustrating.  Not a game I would recommend.

A dull game with a large set up time and theme problems. You're more or less totally unable to influence another party member's encounter without special abilities which feels so completely wrong in practice. The number of times our barbarian was standing next to our bard watching him get squashed by a zombie...

Worst of all, massive quality control issues both known and purposely left unaddressed by Paizo. Chinese printers produced colour variations in some of the sheets such that the backs of the cards were noticeably different making it hard not to know what you're about to draw. If you got one of the faulty sets then Paizo would replace them. However they decided to move to US printers part way through the adventure path which were totally different colours to the Chinese ones. If you had a Chinese set then Paizo will not replace these with new US prints, you will just be expected to deal with it. In other words they traded a situation where you would sometimes have a problem and Paizo would sort it out, for a situation where you were guaranteed to have a problem that Paizo would do nothing about. Customer services will direct you to the Paizo forums where their dedicated fans will fervently defend the company and advise you to buy new cards or sleeves. Spend more money on Paizo after this? How about I never buy anything from Paizo ever again instead?

I think Selinker is a great designer this is a highly original and extensible game. I've made an adventure for it myself. RotR is unfortunately a bit too easy. If you are good at co-opping with your friends, you might want to add an extra location deck and maybe an extra monster to each stack or something. Highly recommend the Linear Location variant on BGG. Greatly enhances challenge and strategy, and make the game a bit more sensical in terms of movement and the board.

I have played through about 15 games solo and 5 with my wife and while I definitely enjoyed, I did have some problems with the game. The gameplay doesn’t match the theme very well and after a while the scenarios all start to feel the same. Also the rulebook is a hot mess.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty enjoyable, I've only played through the first two scenarios SOLO so far, controlling 2 characters. I think it'd be more enjoyable to play with someone else, but it's not quite fun enough to want to play during one of the few-and-far between game nights and honestly I'd rather play imperial assault or something similar if I'm doing a campaign. 

The theme is very dark as well, so playing with my son is 12+ years out.

That being said, the app is excellent, and removes the setup/tear down issues. However, since you can bail on a scenario with little to no effect, there's almost no true danger/risk of dying/losing your character. At least with the physical game, you'd rather not quit because of the resulting setup time.

RATING: 8
I've played this quite a bit now (66 plays), I haven't played the last pack of adventures yet. It's hard to argue with the play count, clearly something has kept us coming back to play this game. Even for the combined price 66 plays is great bang for the buck. However, the game does leave quite a lot to be desired. The basic mechanic is kind of boring. To win you must make sure not to spend cards on much else other than exploring and defeating Henchmen and Villains. Spread out to cover the areas, optimize people's placement based on which locations they can close, rinse and repeat ad nauseam. When you do fight someone who matters you have so many dice that you completely obliterate them. There are not many interesting decisions, and there's no tension.

So... 66 plays!! Why? Well, I think there is one aspect of the game which really shines and that's the RPG-esque character progression. It's just so satisfying to level up and get better loot. It's unfortunate that the game you play between these level ups is a bit dull and underdeveloped. It has been fun to see how the different characters play and experiment with different builds (to the extent that it's possible). 

Certainly not a stellar game, and hardly deserving of the 8 I rate it, but I just can't argue with the amount we've played the game. Definitely the worst game I've ever rated an 8 if that makes any sense.

------------------------------------------------------

So far this game has been very addictive and a lot of fun. It isn't a Euro-game by a long shot but it is a wonderful combination of RPG and card game. The most engaging feature is the long-term character progression including the slow procedure of deck building. 

It is a unique game system which I think will appeal to a lot of people. If you don't mind dice too much and like the theme of the game you should be inclined to enjoy this. My group has a strong preference for low-luck euro games but we all have some RPG background. We played this 5 times in a row consuming 9 hours and our entire weekly game day. For us this is incredibly unusual. We're going to arrange a separate day to play this for the foreseeable future.

This is the pathfinder set to start with, though only my third favorite set. Though the theme is weaker and more generic than the others, it's the easiest to learn and teach, and still provides a great time. If I had some complaints, it would be that this set has probably the weakest selection of heroes, but with a couple class packs and other base games to give you variety, it's not really a problem.

RATING: 8
Bought at a tremendous discount from Chapters, with the intention of using it for trade bait. Figured it would be worthwhile to at least give it a shot before cycling it out...

Possibly a big mistake, as this has barely left my dining room table since. It will mostly be played solo, with a recurring Friday lunch campaign at work.

It is, as its detractors state, simply a matter of flipping cards and rolling dice - but that is an unfair reduction of playing the actual game. There are multiple tactical decisions to be made - which become even more apparent as more characters are added to the party. 

As a one-time RPG player as well, I really connect with the persistent characters who grow and become stronger with each adventure. 

Really looking forward to the expansions and what new aspects they'll add to the game.

Boardgames can't get much closer to an RPG than PACG. Pass skill checks, use weapons, items and allies to improve your chances, improve your equipment and explore your environment. The rulebook isn't the best leading to repeated rules queries in the first plays. Once past the initial rules hurdles, a pleasant flow should be achievable.

PACG works well as an experience game. Exploring is fun, managing your hand isn't too challenging but nice. The fights are not too complicated. Theme-wise, it succeeds.

Mechanically, the game is average. The variance is limited with the same goal for each scenario to nail down a changing villain by locking all escape routes before defeating him in battle. The difficulty doesn't scale to well across the player count. Surviving the campaign solo doesn't seem possible. Finding the villain can be a chore with two players as he has lots of opportunities to escape. We'll see how far we get with two players. Four players purportedly is too easy. The difficulty of the fights is odd. Defeating the villain and the henchmen can be a piece of cake, defeating certain monsters can be well-nigh impossible if the heroes of the group lack the right skills.

A potentially good game that has to prove if the provided experience compensates the many weaknesses.

A hit in our household - especially at first.  Like the theme and the way different locations and scenarios are set up.  However, get a bit tired of trying to keep track of all the different stipulations (i.e. "At this location..." as well as "In this scenario...", not to mention all your own special powers!)  Also, after many plays, it does begin to feel like 'draw a card, resolve, repeat.'  Unsure if this will hold our attention in the long run.  If it does, it will be entirely because of the character development that replicates the RPG/video game experience.

After years of being addicted to 'bling', mostly in the form of 3d elements, like minis, variable boards etc. in this genre of gaming, I decided to give pure card adventuring, in the form of Pathfinder, a go, mainly because of 'seing the light' after playing Sentinels of the Multiverse, which delivers a great card driven superhero battle experience without a single miniature or die...
I also played a lot of RPgs in my youth, and while I won't go back to that, I'm looking forward to re-experiencing the thrills and emotional investment of long term character building/advancement...

RATING: 7.5
An RPG-style game comprising entirely of cards. The gameplay is a bit too simple. Every turn, flip a card and roll a check. Use cards to modify the roll and thats it. On the other hand, the brilliance of it is that characters can be easily stored from game to game.

I really feel something could be improved. A few symbols for recurring text (e.g. weapons reveal or adventure difficulty). Not really sure how I feel about this game yet.

I grabbed this during my endless search for the one true dungeon crawler.  There's no map or minis, but one can get a dungeon crawler vibe in a theater of the mind aspect.  While it didn't QUITE scratch the dungeon crawler itch it at least put a little ointment on it.  If you just go through the mechanics of the game, it will not feel thematic or at all like a dungeon crawl.  In order to feel the theme and get a story going, when playing with my wife we had a rule that for each card revealed we had to tell a story about what was unfolding.  It made for a lot of fun and it became somewhat of a story telling game prompted by the cards and dice.  It does eventually get a bit repetitive though as the basic scenario mechanic is essentially corner and defeat the villain 90% of the time.  Still, it made for a fun time.

f you're willing to put the time (and imagination/creation) into it, this really can be seen as a (limited) RPG in a box. Sure, it follows a fairly basic "flip a card and chuck some dice" mechanic, but there's scope to build a lot, thematically, around this if you're willing to put the effort in. I am and I love it. If you're less into the idea of creating a story around your game, though, you might be better off with a dungeon crawler board game or something.

It is ok, but I have to agree with Undead Viking, that I do not get the big whoop about this game.
I bought it in the hope to have something that gives me a sense of adventure and exploration/discovery/story, sort of like Decent, but without an overlord, so that I can play it single player - and that goes quicker.

I have to add that I do not have the imagination anymore that I used to have when I was younger, so that is probably part of the problem, also, I like to see where I am going, so a card game just does not do it for me.

Maybe all card games are like this, I do not know, this is the first time I step out of what I know I like and buy a board-game without a board ;-)

Anyway, I will give it a few more plays, but I am kind of disappointed, and I do not want to be, because I spent a lot of money on a big box with a few cards in it, with a lot of mistakes.

Imagination, imagination ..... need it, find it.

RATING: 8.9
Very clever abstraction of an RPG into a card game. Maybe a little too abstracted though. Can start to feel repetitive depending on the character you're playing. 

Playing every scenario once through the entire campaign takes 39 plays. Playtime for each is about 45-90 minutes so multiple scenarios can be played in a night. This will happen more times than not and you will want to keep going, play "just one more". This can lead into the wee hours of the night, but it's enjoyable and something that not many other games can achieve.

As for replayability, I'm not sure there is much. Taken as a whole, I've played it through once; it just took 41 sessions (we lost twice). But now that I've gotten to the end of the campaign and beaten the big baddy, I don't really have a desire to go through it again any time soon.
Be all that as it may, I really can't think of any other game that I've gotten over 40 hours of play out of. Well, there was that one time we played Talisman.

I have played it countless times, and i love it. Great game, the mechanics are straghtforward, there is not lots of trategy or deep , but its fun to make your character progress and strive through the adventures.
The worst, you cant sleeve your cards with the included insert. Im now starting to design one of my own for sleeved cards.
EDIT
Can be repetitive, but i still love it. A pity you dont have something to do with your heroes after the 6 chapter. We have to design new high level scenarios.

We have played though adventure 5. We love it, great game.
EDIT
Adventure 6 now. I hate the death zone, this is getting hard. Still love it, great game with the right players.

Finished at last!
The game has been interesting, but too long for what it is. It cvould have been done with less adventures. The difficulty is super easy with moments of frustrating super difficult times. It is not well balanced, but is fun, really fun to play.
EDIT
I have just discovered, playin with the app, that the game depends a lot in what characters you play. Merisel and the cleric are really giving me headaches to win.

The iOS app is superior in every way to the tabletop game if you're playing this solo/2p. The tabletop game is a chore of setup/teardown time and calculating lots of modifiers. The app makes all of this a breeze, letting you just focus on the core decisions without all the bookkeeping. Add in that the app can more easily add new content and I don't see this box hitting the table again. 

Also, Paizo printed a different backing on the adventure decks for RotR, which is really poor QC, as you can always tell which are the expansion cards. 

I love the app and the game design for solo and 2p pass-n-play.

Not my kind of game. Maybe it's yours, I dunno. Our scenario, replete with discoveries that we played things incorrectly (common with cooperative games since everyone has to play against the game), ended up being a 3 and a half hour ordeal. Since each person only had 6 turns - the scenario was 30 turns and we played with 5 people - this means that one would have to wait about a half-hour before their turn was next. While I believe I played with some people that really slowed things down I also think that this is the kind of game that will see a strong positive skew towards gameplay, as people go through their hands and see what sort of support is available for others. 

I've played plenty of dungeon-crawlers that attempt to emulate role-playing games: the worst IMO are those, like Descent First Edition and this game, that fetishize the dice-rolling and combat poorly: in Descent one played a dungeon-crawler by avoiding combat as much as possible and equipping fast players with double shields. In this game characters will split up from each other and hide from combat as much as they are able - since killing most monsters again yields nothing.

I don't see what most people see in this. If the goal is to play a dungeon-crawl that doesn't need to be set up as one, play Tales of the Arabian Knights. If one wants some dice-rolling combat, just play 4th edition D&D: it's probably quicker.

There isn't much to recommend this. The gameplay is incredibly weak both in terms of story generation and interesting decisions. Go to a location, encounter a random card, and roll a dice to see what happens. The encounters aren't even related to the location you're in, which would at least have added some thematic interest.
The whole thing feels like it was knocked out far too quickly by someone who likes the setting, but doesn't understand how to make gameplay either evocative or fun.

The wife and I are loving this.  Easy enough game with small amounts of decision making with minimal strategy.  Only a few terms to learn and you are off!  Setup is definitely the most tedious part, but if you have two or more people working on it at the same time, its a moot point.  The game is certainly not a replacement for an RPG, but it is always good fun to roll some funny dice along with not knowing what you will encounter next.

This game needs 3 or 4 games before it graps you ( not so easy rules ( a lot of different mechanics (recharge, banish, bury , discard,...))).
A very special combination of dice rolling, cards and role playing. Rules are not so easy because rulebook is sometimes unclear, BUT once you understand the rules this is an very good game for all those that don't have a partner enjoying games. It is very good solo game.
Very addicting game. 

First play with my 2 daughters. We played Brigandoom and my youngest daughter beated the villain in the last turn.

Some cards and dice and that is all... they literally get lost in this box. Could that not have been one size smaller, so it would fit next to normal game boxes (and have a more appropiate price?)

After 9 solo scenarios, this is a good game to scratch the smash face, earn lewtz, level up itch. Diablo in a card format set in the Pathfinder world (as designed) and I think it pulls it off pretty well. Obviously some debate over certain house rules (dealing with "losses", death, etc.) but hey - RPGs always have 'em, right?

RATING: 6
The concept is great. But after 6 scenarios played, the game falls flat for me. 

1. Every session of play is kind of the same.

2. The luck of the dice vs. what card comes up seems to primarily determine whether your party wins a scenario or not. There is some player skill involved, but, well, not that much. (Really just getting to know the cards in your deck and cycling through your deck at the right speed.)

3. So many items, allies, armor, spells, weapons - and so little of value that your character ends up with. 

4. Finding the Villain, defeating him and then having him escape...catching him again and him escaping again. Just how fun is that?

5. Some characters are much better at repeatedly going through a location than others. (So some players play significantly longer.)

6. Some cards require lots of luck for them to be of any use. Example: a card that gives you a bonus die for a Fortitude check - you might have 2 of these in a scenario and then not encounter a Fortitude check for 4 or more scenarios...you have that useless card in your deck. 

7. After playing through three scenarios the game becomes routine, with the excitement level petering out to nothing.

It's a shame as this game has a lot of cool things about it.

I have to admit that after reading the rules. And watching 2 big videos of the gameplay I still had a hard time figuring it out.

the box is a little to big as the nicely ordered cards where all over the place when I openend it. I like the box can cointain all but the cards shouldn't be able to move so easily when in few numbers. It wass messy and ruined a 45 minute preperation...

I prepared most of the characters and the first scenario...

Managed to get the first play in big badadoom or something like that and after exploring the first location in the very first turn of the game . I encountered our villain in the second encounter and managed to beat him...

will play again solo to have a better grasp of the rules.
thank god for boardgamegeek and youtube because without them I probably couldn't play it.

I have never played dungeons and dragons but have played over 500 different boardgames so I would expect it to be easier to grasp.

Yet I feel that if everything clicks it isn't a hard game to play.

Very early rating of 7. allthough the game now feels like a 5. I'm not sure how much the "click" will add to my rating.

chances are I stay with dungeon fighter as my dungeon game.

We have played through the 0 Level missions and started the Level 1 missions.  I like this game a lot.  It gives you a real sense that you are improving your character.  Though I will admit, I wasn't sure what the game was.  Its not really a deck builder, but it does allow you to modify your character as you gain experience.

If the leveling aspect wasn't here, the game would not be as much fun to me, but as it is the game is a perfect fit for me and my family.

This got a fair bit of solo & group play but it's replay-ability is low, driving one to buy additional content.

The desire for self-preservation for each player does a good job at ensuring you don't have one bossy player telling everybody what to do which tends to happen in most co-op games.

As players build their deck from scenario to scenario the "good" items end up in the players' decks and you're driven to buy more content to continue building up items.

The game can be a definite money sink but it's fast to teach and good to pull out when you have a group of friends that have never played it.

Update:  I now own the Lord of the Rings living card game starter set and I'd recommend that one over this for more replayability and cheaper price.

The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is an expandable game, with the first set containing nearly 500 cards. The Rise of the Runelords - Base Set supports 1 to 4 players; a 110-card Character Add-On Deck expands the possible number of players to 5 or 6 and adds more character options for any number of players. The game will be expanded with bimonthly 110-card adventure decks.

Good 'dungeon' type crawl fantasy adventure game. Characters can improve stats/equipment between adventures. Card management mechanism is interesting and scales well from solo to 4 players (6 players with expansion). Card stock on cards is very thin looking like publish on demand. Game play is decent for this type of game. I enjoyed it.

RATING: N/A
After a video review: Seem interesting, it's a kind of deckbuilding adventure game. It seems fit for solo play as you can customise a lot of stuff. There is also a lot of expansions.

Now the game could be possibly long to setup since you need to build all these encounter decks of cards. Most cards also requires dice rolls, so it could take a bit more time to play.

Another issue is that there could be little long term objective and be a game about getting random encounters and dealing with it. I also don't really like that your deck of cards is your HP.

Some people say that equipment, even reusable ones are onetime use. While some players say that you just flip a card, roll dice and repeat.

I think it's worth trying it out.

Well, our group of five finished the full campaign.  I'm not convinced we'll pull it out and give it another run unless someone in the group decides to grab Skull and Shackles or there's more expansions in the future allowing us to use our final characters.  We really did not find this game all that particularly difficult and were rarely challenged but we all enjoyed building the character and the social experience involved.  The final adventure pack 6 did present two very difficult scenarios with the spiders and the final boss showdown where character death nearly occurred...and we did finally lose one scenario and had to repeat it (spiders).  Did I ever say that I hate spiders?  I'm glad to have completed the full campaign finally!

========================================================
FIRST IMPRESSION:

I think I want to like this more than I actually do right now.  There is definitely some cleverness within the game as you seek to level up your character(s), the life mechanism with your deck, and the use of all the different dice certainly brings in the swingyness and chaos of dungeon delving.  Right now, we're probably thinking too much and not enjoying the experience, but I do like the concept of player leveling and each one brings in a different play experience.  

The setup is really a pain as it takes a bit of time setting up each scenario, but I suppose this could be much worse.  Card stock leaves a bit to be desired.  Box is huge.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It is an interesting game, but falls short because of several overall "inconsistencies" (at least for my personal taste):
1) It fails in achieving what it claims to achieve - bringing RPG onto the "board" (=as a card game). It is more of a math-optimization procedure than an adventure/role-playing game. The scenarios are somewhat generic, always finding the villain and defeating him, with varying "locations" (= some special rule and a different composition of generic weapon, item, monster, ally etc cards).
2) For the complexity of interactions between different cards and character skills it still always boils down to a roll of dice, sometimes with really strong impact. Although one could always argue that the amount of dice rolling should somewhat even-out the luck, this is in every other occasion not the case. For my taste, this is too thinky a game to be that much dependent on the luck.
3) It just feels dry - no story-driving elements, always fighting, lose-or-win, etc.

So, I am disappointed by the game with regard to what it supposes to achieve, although the game itself is ok.

I like this game it is fun, but the fun is in going through the whole thing, it's a bit repetative to playthrough again and again if you don't get the expansions. and by the time you get all the expansions you're out a pretty penny seeing as to have all of RotR you'll be out somewhere around >$115.00 That's a high cost for a game that doesn't have any minis or elements you could use in other games.

There’s really not a whole lot to Pathfinder, but it’s a lot of fun. It doesn’t make a lot of sense (if I have a crossbow, why can’t I use it until it gets in my hand?) but you still get the feeling of, if not an entire storyline, individual scenes unfolding. It reminds me a lot of the dumb, exploring fun of Talisman, only without the way that Talisman kind of gets old long before the game is over.

The other interesting thing about Pathfinder is that you can play it solo. This is something I’ve never been inclined to do before; I’m usually wary of games that even have solo rules. But sure enough, earlier today I ordered a copy with the intention of playing it solo. I can see the appeal there. (My only wish, and I know it’s falling on deaf ears, is: why can’t we have this kind of game but with a setting that doesn’t include wizards and goblins?)

I've just been soloing so far, on the Lost Coast (adventure in the base set) its excellent. Each character plays in such unique ways, with tough choices weighing short term and long term goals, and the locations each have a different feel, which is great for story and theme.
 A bit apprehensive about teaching it, theres a lot of small interpretation of rules on how cards interact in borderline ways.  Lots of errata in the FAQ as well.  Can't wait to try with more than one, and to try the Adventure path. But, even if it doesn't go over well, this is the solitaire game i've been looking for.

Really well thought out game. Great balance, works with 1-6 players equally well. Able to include my young sons (aged 11 & 7). Takes time to build characters up, so they don't become super powerful too quickly. You really get attached to your character. I like the co-operative aspect, and the storytelling side of it is great.
The expansions offer lots of replay value, as do the different character combinations.

RATING: 6
On one hand I really like the progression in this game as you build your deck and gain abilities from adventure to adventure. It definitely gives an RPG feel, especially with each scenario having decks specific to it (there isn't much of a narrative, but e.g. the academy location is full of spell cards and if you ever explore a non-spell, you get to explore again). On the other hand, this game is just skill check after skill check. Sure, there is hand management of should you discard this card or not for this check or save it for later, but it feels really repetitive at times. Also, taking damage that wipes out your whole hand can be devastating, as the cards you draw afterwards may very well not be what you need to face future skill checks, making a comeback difficult (besides wiping out over a third of your health), and I hate that this game has fallaway loser/runaway leader (when encountering a bane/acquiring a necessary boon, wasting time on failing to defeat it would be bad enough, but not only is there damage, but a lot of scenarios punish you even more e.g. lose 3 turns on the game's timer. For runaway leader there is a lot of barriers let you explore again if you pass, and a lot of locations give you items if you close them, besides the saving time by progressing and not taking damage).

Encounters are random and cooperation minimal. I really wanted to like it, but it almost feels like a solitaire game flipping cards face up on a deck.

The main problem is the almost complete lack of meaningful decisions: move my character to a location (which I know the type of contents at that location, but the differences are pretty minor, like 2 weapons instead of 1). I flip a card face up and then I need to deal with it.

If it's not a monster, chances are it's an item that particular character has no interest in (like your fighter getting a spell, or your ranger getting a big axe). Even if another character would love to get that item, it's too bad because the character that needs to do the check isn't proficient in that (I understand every character can discard a blessing to add a die, but you can't do that for all the good items, especially if you need to save them for the really important stuff).

Or maybe it's an ally which gives you bonuses for some skill that you have no idea if you'll need to use or not in the future. But you're lucky and you get the ally.

At that point you're over your hand limit, so you might as well discard the ally to explore again and repeat the cycle. Eventually you'll get to the henchmen, or the villain and you'll corner him and win. Or not.

Only played the digital implementation. I like a lot of things in this game - the different ways of playing cards, the variety of classes which do seem to play differently from each other, the campaign with our characters unlocking new skills and upgrading stats and so on.

This however does not change the fact that it's a "flip a card and roll some dice" kind of game, which is not what I look for in gaming. I will likely continue my campaign when I'm in the mood, but I can't see myself playing it much more than that. I also realized I would never want to play the physical version - way too much work for such mechanically simple, random game.

Love the theme and this rating might get better over time. But I really didn't have fun playing this one. I just kept revealing monsters and losing to them because of bad dice rolling and with Ezren, the wizard, I kept losing my spells because of dice rolls, which is a life point. So for me it wasn't fun. The other guys I played with kept finding items and allies; very few monsters. So it wasn't very fun... that is really dictated by the dice rolling and random encounters, but I want to because of the theme and character development.

RATING: 9.4
I watched this game closely for almost a year before I finally bought.  I read so many over-the-top, positive reviews for it that I became skeptical that it was being grossly over-hyped.  Now that I've got several plays under my belt I can honestly say that the reviews were spot on.

This is an awesome game.  The box is loaded with content, putting other card games to shame.  It comes with 3 sort of prequel scenarios (which can be played multiple times) and loads of cards for everything else you need to create and start questing with your hero.  That's before you even open the 6 additional scenarios in the first adventure pack that comes with the game.

A lot of people have compared this game to an MMORPG or Diablo.  Yes, it does have that addictive, "raid dungeon" mentality that will pull you along, tempting you to enter the dungeon over and over again for a piece of loot you want.  But even with the game's addictive nature, the game-play is really good.  I've never had so much fun in a co-op board game working together with the other players.  That you can carry your character throughout the journey just adds to the fun.

I could go on and on, but I can't recommend this enough for anyone who likes card, board or role-playing games.  The whole story is covered in all 6 scenarios and I recommend getting them all including the character add-on deck for the complete experience.

Variants I recommend are the Linear Movement system and the Adventure Guide PDF.  It adds to the story-telling aspect and takes nothing away from the game-play.  Also check out my random adventure generator variant.  This makes the game endlessly re-playable after you finish the storyline.

A really fun co-op experience with over 30 sessions of character development and leveling.

the mechanics are extremely simple, but offer enough room for meaningful decisions and choices. the co-op aspect really shines in this game. there is a lot of discussions and mutual support each turn, which is a lot of fun.

my greatest criticism though is that it is too easy and that the adventure expansions do not rise the difficulty high enough according to character strength.

I am giving the other base-set skull & shackles another try now in hope that that set is more challenging, because i really love the system. however, this set has gotten quite boring, since it is too easy and it seems to get even easier the stronger my character gets. perfectly balanced would be continuously challenging obviously, which this is not.

Finished the main adventure path twice:
(1) Lem (+ Lini, Amiri, Sajan)
(2) Merisiel (+ Ezren, Kyra)

Never lost a single scenario but the last one was very exciting the first time around. The second time we were prepared too well for it to be a real challenge.

Abandoned game:
(3) Tarlin (+ Flenta) (adventure 4)

We have lost several scenarios actually with two. But somehow it is not as exciting as with 3 or 4 players.

RATING: 7
Though it is nowhere near to provide the stuff I like in Roleplaying games, it feeds the same strange hunger that computer games like Diablo fulfill/exploit: go against random colorful foes and collect random shiny stuff. There is just enough occasion for nifty combos that it does not fill totally mindless, although I gotta admit that I expect the difficulty to ramp up a bit after the introductory trio of scenarios. In spite of going with a somewhat lop-sided quartet (no arcane spell-user, no ranged weapon guy), we never came close to losing a team member, let alone a scenario.

We’ll see, but the fact that I’m ready to explore this further already is very high praise for a cooperative game. Playing with closed hands already keeps it from simply being a puzzle, but the sheer chaos inherent in the game design might help even more to ban the alpha player syndrome … if there’s obviously not a lot to plan for, you might as well go with the guts of the active player.

RATING: 8
a little bland and boring at first, but once you either play solo with multiple characters or with other players it really starts to shine and perform as advertised. It really is like a RPG experience with less overhead.

Artwork is mostly well done, mechanics are interesting and show plenty to build on, choices can be difficult, and the persistent character setup grows on you and makes each quest more interesting. If you might lose, you try to stay alive and just get out of a quest with some loot.

The deck building per character is actually nice though sometimes it feels limiting...but as your character grows, so too does the deck, and therefore your configurations can change.

Just a lot to love about this game and it plays GREAT solo. (recommend playing 3 characters solo)

Keep it coming!

RATING: 5
If you like dungeons and dragons and you enjoy feeling like a superhero by saying "I do this, then that lets me do that, and then thats gives me a bonus and so then I get to draw extra cards so then my attack is 6 dice and so I roll and I beat that monster 23 to 7 so i win." Then this game is for you.  

For me, I prefer games like Robinson Crusoe where my character can do practically nothing and how to somehow survive...that to me is more enjoyable.  I absolutely realize I am in the minority, and that means there may be something wrong with me than the other way around.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Wow!  What a solid game.  It really comes across as a lite D&D (or Pathfinder) style adventure without a DM.  The entire scenario is put together through a rather unique system put in place to build decks for towns, caves, and all other manner of adventurous places.  Then each character journeys through these places trying to uncover the mysteries and ultimately battling the main bad guy to win the day.

My gaming group doesn't do much D&D because it can be a strain on not only our time but on the DM as well who has to do a lot of front loading.  This game has the look and feel of an rpg without all that "mess".  I'll absolutely play this one again!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I liked it a lot when we first started playing -- rated an 8 -- but by Adventure Pack 4 (half way through), it was feeling very, very samey and was more of a chore to play then a joy (but we slogged through the full Adventure Path just to have finished what we started and get it over with).  Flip a card, add a bunch of dice, roll much higher than needed, flip the next card.  I rarely felt that an encounter was a challenge and I became bored with nearly every exploration/turn feeling just like the last.  Very few Adventure Packs truly feel different from the next, with the typical exception of one Scenario per Adventure Pack that is unique in some way.

For me, this would've been better with a much shorter Adventure Path, mixing all the unique Scenario mechanics into a shorter play experience that would allow for more constant variety.  I also feel that such a format would give the game more re-playability (since I don't see myself ever going through again with a different character for only about 10% of the game to actually feel different).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I played this the first time because, although I didn't think it would be my cup of tea, I was curious about it. I like the concept. I played it the second two times because my friends were into it, and it was a fun way to hang out and get in some gaming with them. It's not my jam.

Mechanically, it's fine. There's a solid engine under the hood. But it's dull as ditchwater. Every adventure, at least in the arc we played, feels basically the same. My deck and character improve slightly each time, but there's a lot less deckbuilding than I was hoping for.

I wanted to feel immersed in the experience, and I never did. I wanted to face tough choices, but only got easy ones -- and non-choices. The D&D Adventure Game series already does everything I wanted this game to do.

Have played through the entire adventure path with 4 sets of characters. We played it extensively before the adventure path was completed. Played using 22 different sets of 4 characters, including custom characters.

One of the most addictive games I own. Just one more scenario... The dice factor is mitigated by good play. Sometimes we crush a scenario, sometimes it is close, and occasionally it comes to the last tick of clock.

With more variety in the locations and scenarios this would be a 10. As it is, it is like a 9.5+

RATING: 7
The main draw for me to this game was its centrality around its use of dice for event resolution. I enjoy the various sided dies, and how the one you use to roll is based on the strength of your character's various abilities. That is very fun. I like how you can upgrade your characters after each adventure. That gives great immersion by watching your character develop as your adventure progresses. It really makes me feel like i'm playing an RPG, without the intimidation of having to create a character myself. I kinda wish there was a miniature or something else to look at though. But this is amazing considering its just a card game. And i thought the character health being portrayed as the player deck size was a really well done mechanic.

It's nothing but, flip a card, roll a die, flip a card, roll a die.  Very disappointing.

Played the first scenario Brigandoom 3 times so far with my wife. The first two times through were really slow because we chose to characters that were underpowered when played together (Lini, Ezren).  To that end we second guessed a lot of what we were doing and lost badly.  The third time we played with two new characters, Merisiel and Harsk, and we kinda fudged our way to a unsatisfying victory although Merisiel died :(.  Overall we had an enjoyable time and are planning on attacking Brigandoom again as well as play the game with more people.

Good: 
The game uses artwork from the Pathfinder universe, which I am a fan of. 

Bad
There isn't enough of a benefit to really be co-operative on another player's turns. If you help allies, you discard cards that you will need for your turn. This assures that you won't be able to as much on your turn. 

On your turn there aren't many real options, you just continue to search the location you are in until you find a challenge and then use the cards in your hand to overcome it. 

Card quality isn't as good as I would like. One character card was briefly placed on a wet spot and ended up warped. 

Overall, for me, this doesn't feel like an adventure, it feels like crawling through a location decks and hoping you don't find the main boss until you are ready for them.

I've been having fun with it even solo. Erasable markers work on the cards and come off clean, at least the brand I have, (see RRT video). Some nice RPG feel to it. May rate higher if later expansion packs have different types of scenarios, more LOTR style. As find the pile jumping bad guy may have limited value.

Only just got this for Christmas. Loving it so far although only had one play. Might replace LOTR LCG for a while

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
 Setup time is ok. Only concern is that the theme slowly disappears because decisions are primarily mathy rather than thematic in nature. In that way it reminds me of the LOTR LCG because after a few turns theme disappears and its just a math puzzle. The main thing that moves this design further is the added motivation of collecting loot (expanding your deck), this encourages players to think in character more and to be driven by their characters long term selfish needs and wants.

Update: I've gotten very fast at setting up the game so that's no longer an issue. I also found some areas were I was playing wrong so I now find the game more balanced and challenging. With the higher challenge level it starts to feel more thematic. I will be playing my first multiplayer game tomorrow and I hope that it really brings the character moments to the forefront, solo play tends to be a mathy experience because there is no one to interact with in a meaningful way...

Update: the game didn't go over well with my gaming group and its very random when played solo. This game may be dead to me... I'll give it one my chance.

Update: stopped playing solo when I stopped caring about the random story. I'll try it again with gaming group... If they aren't blown away by it I'm going to cancel my subscription.

I wasn't sure if I was going to like the game as I knew nothing of Pathfinder, and I wasn't sold on the card mechanic, but I ended up loving the game.  If you read the fluff \ books that go along with the story, there is a lot of theme there.

While the card mechanic might seem odd at 1st (discarding weapons \ armour, etc.), it does actually work and for the most part captures the theme.  The progression is also nice.  While most of the adventures \ missions are pretty much the same, there is a bit of variety.  There are always new enemies, and new gear to find.  Locations can also alter the game slightly.

I had heard that this game was very simple, but I thought the role-playing aspect of it would be a primary element.  While playing the game like an RPG and filling in the juicy bits of context and detail is definitely possible, the fact remains that the gameplay is very simple.  After playing the first 6 sections, I am left feeling that the game is awfully repetitive.

It's possible that added variety comes as you delve further...after all, I've only played the first full scenerio and most of the way through the second...and the first one is explicitly an intro scenario.

I'm left a bit disappointed.

Honestly this is just not for me.  I really dislike what I perceive as a lack of a story.  This became card flipping and dice rolling for no other reason than that's what the card said.  Highly disappointed.  Anyone want to purchase from me?  GM me, it's in pristine condition complete with card sleeves.

RATING: 6.5
A great concept and enjoyable game, although I really wish there was a stronger sense of cooperation. The character development system is a fantastic idea, though!

Edit: After completing the campaign, I'm not all that interested in returning to it or starting a new one. The game gets quite stale, as the story doesn't really shine through and the gameplay isn't incredibly involved. That's what happens when you take the most roleplaying element out of a game based upon roleplaying, I guess.

I bought this primarily to play solo, with the hopes of getting some others to play occasionally.  

I like that it takes the form of a campaign, and that characters get better from one scenario to the next.  The character progression is a little slower than I'd like, but if you enjoy the game, then what's the rush?

The game set up is a little long, but because I'm mostly playing solo, it's not a big drama.

At this stage I'll probably be stopping with Adventure Deck 2, but who knows?  The allure of collecting a set may kick in if I start seeing them getting cheaper.

[b]100,000 Feet.[/b]

First attempt at rating, after playing through the 3 scenario mini-adventure path with Valeros. 

7.5 (This is subject to change.)

Well it's a lot of fun in the short term. Convincing enough that I have bought the character expansion and full scenario set (Really I think these should come with the base set or at least be packaged into two parts rather than 6). 

I'm not totally convinced that I won't wake up one day and find that the game has turned to dust in my hands. Definitely a love it or hate it, group dependent game. All in, right now: [b]7.5[/b]

Spent an enjoyable afternoon making may way through the mini-adventure path and writing it up. Really enjoyed getting and selecting the loot. There is decision making here but I suppose it's not particularly deep and is subject random event which make it's meaningfulness limited. Still it is a light game so none of these factors are damming, I could see this being a good family game. Interpreting the cards into a story is enjoyable childish play.


[b]Very Early early thoughts (Prior to reading rules or playing the game):[/b]

The artwork and overall presentation is a heck of a lot better than I had been expecting, given the criticisms I heard. Sure the items do have a oddly clinical backdrop, not unlike the display in Skyrim. Totally serviceable and frankly it just makes the other images shine all the shinier.

Given the price I can't help but think the dice should be a little more so. (I suppose just having 'fancy dice' would be a boom for non-rpgers - meh I'll be throwing in a couple other dice sets.)

Slightly worried that the gameplay and story will be clunky and disjointed; resulting in the overall experience being lacklustre. Kinda wish there was more flavour text.

Bought an erasable ink pen specially for the set. Didn't shop around and so it ended up costing 7.5% of the base set. Sleeves should have been included, which would have resolved this and removed any delay in getting the game to the table. (Oh I see that they are in Skully Shackles = well good.)

[b]Early thoughts (Having played a dry run)[/b]

Quite a lot of text on the cards makes it a little bit tricky with soft new players unless the host is experienced. 

Odd bit of confusion with how locations and monsters powers interact.

Don't fully understand how significant banishing cards is. 

Odd bit where a 'survive' check could be used but neither PC had mention of such a variable. 

Odd bit when a character isn't proficient with weapons but starts with them... ermmm?

Feel that there should be a simple card crib sheet telling players the turn order. The games really simple but providing a visual overlay of this would be a positive step with new players.

Lem got killed half way through the game from fairly innocuous monsters. This is good but ho-hum we negated as much risk as possible and still got him killed. Hmmmmm...

We enjoyed taking turn about placing, explaining what happened in the context of game in role-play. Ah now Boris the burglar it turns out isn't a nice fellow and has decided he wishes to relieve you for your jewels and eyes (Traitor Monster). This was fun, though is group dependent.

[b]Later Early thoughts (Having played the first mini=adventure)[/b]

Yeah I've enjoyed it so far.

Feel that much of the game relies upon the enthusiasm of the audience. That's not a bad things and I suppose RPGs do in general. But, this of  course is not an RPG so it's a risky rode to take. Time will tell.

Really excited to mix in the first chapter of the scenario. Really geeky OCD fun -I Like it! 

[b]Late later early thoughts:[/b]

Well in my solo campaign I'm oddly stuck on the second mission of the official quest line. 

On paper it should be easy and is just an opportunity to get loot, in practice I've failed the mission 4 times in a row. Down to widely difficult cards draws or bizarrely low rolls - hmmmmmm. I've dropped my rating to a 7.

La verdad es muy buen juego, solo con cartas se logra un estilo de juego muy parecido a los juegos de rol, me gusta la idea de ir mejorando a tu heroe y que haya continuidad entre aventuras, por lo unico que no le doy el 10 es porque hasta ahorita con el puro set basico se me han hecho muy faciles los escenarios y la verdad es que no me gustaria perder porque pierdes todo lo que hayas avanzado a tu personaje, solamente si ya vas como en la aventura 3 puedes quedarte cartas de la 1 me parece, aunque yo todavia no llego a esa...

Por todo lo demas es un juegazo, pero si pienso que me hubiera gustado mas con un nivel mas alto de dificultad y que al morir perdieras cosas pero que no fuera tan desastroso, aun asi se diisfruta mucho jugandolo.

Captures the feeling of a random dungeon crawl well. Interesting but slow character progression and encounters can start to feel the same if played back to back. New adventure decks seem to add more variety. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This actually looks kind of interesting to me. I don't want to get into a real RPG and most of the dungeon crawling board games out there look too fiddly or too boring. This game offers campaigns, leveling up, refinement of skills and equipment, etc., with what looks like simpler rules and quicker start and setup. Not sure I'd buy it without playing it first, but I'd certainly give it a try.

Pretty fun. Rulebook is a little confusing at times but once you get play going this quickly becomes an entertaining, fast-paced game with some very neat mechanics.

Only thing I really don't like about this game is that when it ends, it's awfully abrubt and anti-climactic. It really needs some "end of game" flavour text to read off, rounding off the story with the defeat of the boss and what happens next.

Instead, you just get "oh, we succeeded the check, we win, time to pack up".

RATING: 8
A lot of dice rolling. A lot. And a patchy rulebook (but everything seems to be in there, when you find it). And maybe not a lot of game. But still, this is a lot of fun, and compulsive. I really enjoyed it. As with all games of this type, you need to provide some of your own entertainment, but everything comes together, finding new items that suit your character is particularly joyful. Looking forward to playing some more.

RATING: 7
Nice mechanics, great components. 
Needs some work and modification to be an adventure game that actually creates an adventure.
Out of the box, this creates encounters much too random to tell a story.
Why is there a zombie in the convenience store? Killed it. Oh, now there is an ancient skeleton. And a cave-in. The shopkeeper should clean up more.
(Although this CAN happen at a Walmart)

RATING: 9
Excellent theme and feel. Lots of tense moments. Scratches a lot of gaming itches (random encounters, card combos, die rolls, skill buffs,etc.) Tweaking your deck between scenarios adds a lot to making the characters "yours."

RATING: 4
Initially I was extremely impressed. The character progression was amazing and something I had never really expereicned before since I wasn't an RPGer. The system was simple and I expected it to grow as well, but it didn't. It was really more of the same, over and over. It's too bad, becasue this could have really been a hit with me.

RATING: 7
I can see this won't be everyone's cup of tea but we had a great time with it. I like this expression of the venerable hobby - not quite an RPG experience, not quite a card game, but a cool hybrid. We ran out of steam with it after about five plays but it's still there to be finished.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I played this solo with three characters and it works fine. The game lacks story and is essentially a loot game. Turn a card, roll for checks and turn another card. The fun aspect of the game is getting new cards, improving the decks of your characters and improving skills and stats between games. I like to play this just to be playing something solo and burning some time. For that it is great. If you are looking for story or hard choices look elsewhere.

RATING: 9
This game shouldn't work. I scoffed at it when I read the rules. But the more I played, the more I became entranced. There's not much there- flip a card, respond to it- but the lack of mechanical distractions works to enhance the narrative for me. Character attachment is remarkably high, and advancement is an addictive mix of regular rewards and lucky pulls/desperate rolls. Far better than expected and has had serious legs in both solo and group play.

RATING: 10
Permanently changing your character so that what you choose determines your later success.  

It's an "RPG" that I play with my wife and daughter (8) that they can enjoy.  

Right now, it's easier with solo play than group.  

Also, I've now played 5 times and I still haven't done everything correctly yet.  
------------------------------------------------------
Thought that you could provide more help to the other players--especially if you are in the same area. 
-------------------------------------------------
As the rules state, this game is just a 1-6 player version of solitaire with minimal interaction and a long wait time for you to do anything on your next turn.  

My rating went from a 9 (one of my favorites) to a 5 simply because I didn't read for pronouns very well.  I wouldn't recommend this for any more than 1 player.  
-----------------
Up to a 6, I've played it their way and it works OK.  After spending this much money, I want to finish to say that I did.  
------------------------
Finished this after a year.  well worth the money.  100+ plays for the money. 

I put it up at a 9 again because of the time investment.  I really like this universe and will definitely play more games in it (like Season 2/3).  

I would like there to be more player help at locations than just asking for divine favor.  I also think that a wizard that doesn't use his/her sword and a spell is just stupid.   Of course, there are those D&D major/minor actions and I'm sure that Pathfinder limits you in some ways as well.  

Now, if Selniker et al. would take their Aprocrypha and put it into a fantasy system, I am game for that.

I currently have a love hate relationship with this game. I just don't know where it falls. Some games are crazy fun, others are surprisingly boring. Having trouble getting it back to the table due to (1) the setup time and (2) the feeling of "will it be fun this time?"

Jury's still out on this one - I'm only interested in it for solo play.

Update: How the hell can a game this random be rated so highly?

Another update after more solo plays: Random, tedious, crap! If you defeat the villain, it's meaningless because it was just luck, if you don't, it's also meaningless, but slightly more frustrating. Turns that have more than one obvious decision to make are rare. Then it's all luck of the cards, combined with luck of the dice. How is this fun? This is the most over-rated game I've ever played.

Nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon. Mechanics are simple and it's nice to get attached to the characters. We play a 2-player game with 2 characters each.

Take the stuff that is great about Mage Knight and the D&D co-op Ameritash games, remove the fluff and a couple of hours of game play and you have this. It's fun, it does a good job evoking its theme, the leveling up means that increasingly the game feels like something is at stake, and at the end of it all it does not overstay its welcome.  I look forward to continuing my campaign.

I've been playing this solo a lot and it is fun, but too easy so far with my Monk. Not sure how long it will stay that way because the abilities are getting more specific in the expansions. I may need to play two characters which I do not want to have to do. 
Also, the game has some terrible down time with 5 players and one player will have to be cut because it is ruining the game for everybody. The character expansion should have just given more choices and not increased amount of players. 
1-4 players and it is a wonderful game.

PACG is a great mashup of some role-playing concepts with a LCG. It's more fun to play with a group of people than solo. If it was a better solo experience, I'd give it a 9. Some ambiguities in the card text and rules keeps it from being rated higher.

11/2013 - Bumped rating to 9 because my wife and our gaming friends are hooked on the game. Card text and rules issues aside, it's a really fun game in a group setting.

This game is not for me.  I played only once and I felt like there were no interesting decisions: I would travel to a random location deck, have a random encounter, resolve it with a random die roll and then pass my turn.  There was also an annoying and tedious amount of shuffling the location decks.

Solid adventure-style card game with campaign and leveling-up support right out of the board. Not sure how to keep it interesting, though. Like LOTR this one tends to get repetitive. LOTR is saved by the deckbuilding aspect. Leveling is too slow here to maintain long-term interest IMO.

Pathfinder Card Game works best for me as a solo or two player game. It fills a niche in my collection in a way that I hoped Lord of the Rings LCG would but didn't.

Be sure to read all of the flavor text to better appreciate the game - otherwise the "adventure" just becomes a bunch of die roll challenges with some hand management.

I was pretty disappointed by this. I played it with a friend and the missions felt too simple and there wasn't much to do. You just draw cards from the location deck and see what happens. It's also lacking in the theme/flavor department.

One really annoying thing is when you draw a card that is much better suited for another character (like you're playing a warrior and you draw a spell that your friend's wizard needs) but they can't resolve the skill check for you so you end up losing the spell and wasting a good card.

Maybe it will be more fun with a higher number of players (or heroes).

Great to satisfy the quest, loot, character improvement, and rolling-the-dice itches.

Game would be rated higher if there was more lore/story or difference between characters.  Might also be good if there was a mechanic to incentivize switching out cards in your deck based on the scenario, as decks mostly stay the same.

Lots of expansions and DLC-feel to it but if you play all the characters it's a good value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very basic RPG themed card adventure game, the main draw being hero progression between games, suffers from a lot of repetition, same quest objective each time, and bland art and presentation, but has addictive gameplay, ingenious use of deck building to create campaign play, easy to set up, a great storage box (unless you're a chronic sleever), and a classic D&D (Pathfinder, whatever) theme.

Not sold on the Pirates theme for the sequel yet, but am definitely in for the full Path of the Runelords game.

UPDATE 20/12/16:

The app is amazing, but I did enjoy the feel of shuffling the cards and marking up my card (sleeves) as I levelled up. Lots of downtime in multiplayer and just didn't work with our group, so this makes a great solo game, but once I'd finished the RotR campaign I didn't feel the need to go back to it again. I also didn't like how the encounters and boons sort of arbitrarily wandered off if you didn't defeat them, and that you could sometimes draw "miss a turn" hands that you couldn't do anything with. That said it's an excellent innovation for introducing campaign rules into games, which is what everyone loves these days of course, and the sheer amount of content that Paizo has thrown into this series is quite staggering.

Really exciting game. Playing solo most of the times. Why I rate it only 8.5 is: You have to make a story by yourself - was disappointment to discover.

RATING: 9
Edit: Game almost ruined for me because of poor quality control on Paizo's part.  This caused certain adventure decks to have different coloration on the card backs and to be slightly different sizes.  For a game that depends on card anonymity and lots of shuffling, this is a HUGE problem.  I refuse to spend money of sleeves for what is clearly a problem on Paizo's part. 

Main Comment:
My main comparison to this game is Runebound.  To my mind, Runebound is still the better solo adventure board game.  The maps. The sense of a journey that only just happens to be part of a larger conflict.  Runebound has very simple mechanics and a loose enough imposed story that players can, if they are so inclined, create their own story from the bits and pieces that they accumulate / encounter.  The game's "looseness" and map encourage this. 

However, what Pathfinder Adventure Card game does ABSOLUTELY better than any other game is evoke the emotions of and sensibilities of a VIDEO RPG. Lots of small, bite-sized "levels." Transitions from scenario to scenario.  Lots of "checks" for characters to engage in.  Mechanics for characters to play off of one another.  Relatively quick set up, so that a loss/death can be quickly restarted at the last "save point."  And a clean, clean attention to bookkeeping.  Honestly, I think this is BETTER than most DnD-type sessions I played in.

Also, as far as character development in terms of a "skill tree" or "buffs" the Pathfinder Adventure game is VERY impressive.  A character's deck changes with the game, and decisions get made as to how to specialize characters in terms of their skill set.  I wouldn't say that any of this necessarily lends itself to NARRATIVE, but it IS very compulsive.  It's also very satisfying to have buffed up character in terms of complimentary  abilities, so that they work well together as a team.  That is where the game really shines, imo.

That said, having played through the entire adventure path, there is an advantage to playing "smart" as opposed to "narratively."  I played with Harsk and Valeros, and I had established a running gag in which Valeros needed to prove how smart he was.  So he took on a headband that gave him extra intelligence, an ally that gave him INT/WIS, a robe that boosted his intelligence...  Similarly, Harsk was constantly missing out on allies due to his horrible charisma.  There was a gag where he took on a potion, and used it to gain an elven beauty side-kick.  Otherwise, though, it was all crows and monkeys for him.  These "narrative" decisions mostly ended up being relatively inconsequential as far as game play went in the first 4 adventure decks.  After that, though, these decisions actively hurt the characters.  Characters will perform better if you look through and adventure deck and get a sense of what sorts of checks are going to be needed, and then play / acquire things accordingly.  I lost one scenario simply because both of my characters were in a location that got hit by an avalanche.  Bad rolls by Valeros despite burning all our our blessings did us in.  Thematic?  Perhaps.  But a little frustrating, and taken care of once I stopped "building" my characters narratively.

I have to say that I found the rulebook to be surprisingly bad.  Really bad because the terminology is overly precious in certain cases and then general in others.  The rules could have been efficiently presented in half the space, and been much more useful.  DOWNLOAD ONE OF THE RULES SUMMARIES FROM BGG!!  Even so, there were many instances in which I needed to head to the BGG discussion boards to get clarification on rules.  I didn't really know that you could "retreat" until I was playing the last adventure deck.  I was under the impression that a maximum of TWO explores was allowed in a turn until the last adventure deck.  The notion of a turn was confusing for a while given certain cards...was it every character getting a go (no) or a single character's go (yes).  I didn't realize that a "trait" was different than a card level, and so started to remove all "basic" cards from the game, at one point, as opposed to cards with the basic *trait*.  I was never sure *when* certain cards could be played, and made a best guess, learning to basically trust EXACTLY what was written on a card.  If it did not specify a play condition, then assume it can be played whenever (as long as a card of that type had not already been played for a particular check).  Etc.  Etc.

On the other hand, by the time I got to the end of the game, it was pretty fantastic just how many cards did NOT have issues.  Further, the card distributions, on the whole, are pretty amazing.  Yes, there are a few cases in which a scenario is radically easier or harder based on the number of characters.  However, for 90% of the scenarios the method of titrating locations to number of characters worked very nicely.  Also for the most part, even though you randomly draw to create location events, most of the cards somehow fit the scenario.  Or at least could be imagined to fit the scenario.  I can't imagine the playtesting time that went into that.  Also, once the relatively simply rules are grasped (no thanks to the rulebook), you don't really need the rulebook.  The cards tell you, pretty much, exactly what to do.

In sum, VERY interesting and amazingly clever game.  Occupied me off-and-on for 4 months.  And that's saying something.  It really does capture the essence of a DnD-style RPG.  I don't think those sorts of RPGs do much, really, to tell stories.  It's all about going with what you've got to maximize a check.  That's the essence of DnD.  This gives you that minus the interminable stupid table comments that suck up so much time.  Compulsive in the way that video games can be...but more compulsion than evocation in my opinion.

Final edit: first rated this game game a 7.  After going through the entire adventure path, I'm giving it a 9 but with a HUGE caveat.  Having played through it once, the game no longer has much value for me.  I'm done.  I have no desire to try the adventure path again with different characters.  As I say, the game is more compulsive than evocative for me.  And so my 9 is in recognition of the fact that the game provided me with many, many hours of play.  Roughly 2 hours per scenario.  So something like 100 hours of time spread over many months.  After this experience, though, I'm done with the game, and don't *really* feel like I experienced a narrative.  Just consumed many enjoyable "snacks."

RATING: 7
This is a card game which follows the model of role playing games. You have a specific character, with specific dice values for traits. There are a number of locations represented by cards. Each turn you are exploring locations for items, spells, monsters and villians. Combat with monsters is resovled with dice, using the right dice for your character, and other players can add dice to your combat at the cost of a blessing card.  When your 15 card deck runs out and you can't refill, your character dies, and you lose all gained levels and items.  To win the scenario, generally you have to corner a villian so they can't flee to locations that are still open.

It's a fun game, especially if you are into the campaign mode of keeping characters and watching them grow. It's generally not hard to defeat the scenario. I'd like play a few more times to see what the different scenarios offer.

A tightly integrated system, built around a wide range of cards.  Coming from a D&D RPG background, for me this plays more naturally than many RPG-derived board games, while also being deeper and more nuanced.
The blessings deck brings a sense of urgency as well as occasional unexpected bonuses; the player deck gives access to all facets of your character (if not always in the order you'd like); the location decks bring not only a loose narrative to the encounters, but also chances to improve yourself into the future.
I very much look forward to playing this further.

RATING: 10
A solid mix of card game and story-based RPG. Its cards guide you through hints of a story (touching on a lot of the lore from the Pathfinder comics and rulebooks), so there's more story setup than, say, Dungeoneer. Ultimately, the game is about powering-up your character and coming up with strategies to ferret out your target villain as efficiently as possible, racing against a countdown. A fun single and multi player game.

If only it weren't so simplistic and so dice-based. I think this could be a great game, if the system was a bit better. It appears very simplistic, sadly.

I like the graphics and idea of the gameplay but theres so many key terms, reading, and reliance on card flips/draws and die rolling that it really ruins the experience. Regular dnd is also more immersive. This was on the app too so i didnt need to setup and had music and good graphics too.

Best adventure board game. The permanence and ownership of the heroes is awesome.

I've lost 4 characters already: Merisiel, ranger, Kira and Seoni. Going on the adventure with Valeros (who lost Seoni in the Skinsaw Adventure), Lem and Sajan ( who took Valeros away from the tavern where he spent all his time). 

I have tension yet, but only due to the blessing timer. I hope that the third adv. is tougher. Not many characters left although...

RATING: 8
A well designed game with a HUGE replay value. This is not a deck building game like Android: Netrunner is for example. As the campaign progresses you get better gear that you can use in your character deck which is relatively small in number.

You buy new card packs (Adventures) to continue adventuring.

Pros:
- Good balance and design.
- Replay value is huge. There are many characters to choose from and how to progress with them. Location decks change every time. New cards in adventure decks.
- You can play this game alone and you can start playing with a new character anytime, even if other players have played many scenarios already, you can "hop in."
- Character advancement with story arch over multiple sessions.
- Character deck is fun to build.

Cons:
- If you are a role-player the role-playing element is at it's minimum. You could add some storytelling if you wanted. This is pretty much a hack 'n' slash game.
- The setup time between scenarios is long, you need to shuffle every card and build decks... shuffling, shuffling.
- If you want to continue playing, you eventually need to keep buying adventure decks.

Excellent card game! Since I've bought it, I've played it every free time I had. The way your characters grow is the best part of the game, and the decisions of what to keep in your deck at the end of the mission are getting harder by each quest. The cherry on top of the cake is that it plays extremely well solo and bellow the 2h mark!

RATING: 7
1: Learning the rules, we did a lot of things wrong
2: Solo play, rules revised, OK. This is turning to be an amazing game. (Playing with Ezren, Amiri, Merisiel and Kyra)
3: Solo play, advancing on rules comprenhension. Awesome play, won by a hair's breath.
4: Defeat! The blessings' marker leaked out just one card before encoutering the villain Blackfang!
5: Victory! Blackfang defeated and Perils of the Lost Coast completed. Now, let's see those Burnt Offerings.
6: Attack on Sandpoint! After a villain escape I managed to find him again and thanks to the Holy Candle the day was saved.  
7: Local Heroes was more relaxing than all the previous scenarios, but only at the beginning, the last location was crowded with undead.
8: Touble at Sandpoint. It's getting harder, this time both Amiri and Merisiel had a close call. Good thing that Kyra and Father Zantus were nearby. So... another victory for the heroes.
9: Approach to Thistletop. Victory! It only took me 6 Blessings (20') to finish the Villain Gogmurt. I promise that I shuffled the cards a lot. An easy victory doesn't taste that good, I'll repeat the scenario (no reward on the repeat, all risks, wasn't this a push-your-luck kind of a game?).
10: This we could call the repeat-and-defeat play. Gogmurt escaped untill there were no Blessings on the Blessings' deck.
11: (Españoles, Amiri ha muerto) On the search for Nuala, Amiri died on a trapped passageway. The group could not stand their first KiA and the scenario was lost (I ran out of blessings on the blessings' deck).
12: Valeros came for the last scenario of the Burnt offerings adventure and I started the hunting for Nuala. After a tense and focused play (I believe that Amiri died beause I wasn't very focused on the previous game -the problems of playing when you are tired-), Merisiel executed the killing blow on Nualla avenging her friend in the process.

Pros: Adictive on campaign mode. Captures the essence of an RPG and puts it on a card game. Great on solo, interesting on multi-player (you can chose wether to help or not). Highly replayable. When deployed, fits on a desk so I can play it more often than other games.

Cons: Can be repetitive, repetitive, repetitive if played a lot. The set up takes some time and a lot of shuffling. You have to look on the FAQ or the rulebook at least once a play. 

Word of advice: This is not a deckbuilding game, but you have to "build" the locations' and your character's deck in order to play. The deckbuilding it's made all on the set up phase.

Last thoughts about the game: After 35 plays and at the beginning of the last chapter I think I exhausted the game. Though I still have fun playing it it has become a bit dull because of it's repetitiveness and I find easier every play I make. Still, I enjoyed tremendously playing this game solitaire with four characters.

A little "samey" after several adventures. I'm imagining a print and play mini-expansion that puts quest text in place of the minions and boss and then has you pull the appropriate fight out of the box. That way you at least get a sense of an advancing story on each adventure, though it does require writing, like, a LOT.

Really enjoying the senario decks Paizo is putting out for this game.  The blessing deck timer mechanic puts a time limit on the games that helps with plot drag and the variety of outcomes each turn make plays unique and tense - something that is not obvious when just looking at the game in general.  This game has completely replaced Sentinels of the Multiverse for me in terms of co-op card games.  There is just so much more direction and purpose in the P:ACG without the EXTREME fiddliness and frustration of SoTM.

Gameplay does get somewhat repetitive and as a result we have stalled around the middle of Adventure Pack #5, but optimistic that we will eventually complete the series.  Further adventures may be had in different, more mechanically complex and thematic LCGs releasing Fall 2016 (See Arkham Horror: The Card Game).

We pushed through and finished our Lem and Harsk campaign - it was very challenging and exciting - I am happy we played the entire adventure, but am excited to move on after the 5 years and 2 days it took to get through all the content.  There has been a lot of innovation in the space since 2013!

BOX INSERT: Paizo factory insert is surprisingly adequate if you juggle categories around as needed.  Since the game may be shelved once completed, no commercial insert will likely be required.  

Also numerous sessions via iOS application on iPad/iPhone.  Nice to not have to setup, but cardboard is still king for multiplayer for sure.

A fun adventure game that takes the RPG experience and removes the DM to streamline the experience. Fight monsters, get loot, chuck dice yadda yadda.

At first I really enjoyed this game. I didn't know too much about the pathfinder universe but I was drawn in by the deck building character growth aspect. Each scenario feels like a chase where you hunt down the big bad boss until you corner him. Upon multiple plays some flaws of the game began to reveal themselves.

1) Majority of scenarios play out the same! there are 3 in the base box (2 seek & destroy and 1 "disable traps")

2) the locations and general themes of the scenario get recycled and feel generic! There's no narrative really being played out. There's no reason in particular to search the forest for the big baddie- you just do it because that's how the game works. none of the scenarios have set monsters to fight against except the minions the big bad has with him in the game. the monsters are random so you can find a zombie in the middle of the city streets and a goblin at the farm.

3) Unbalanced stats use. Characters in the game have stats and skills that give bonuses to dice rolls however a lot of skills in the game are just not important. You are honestly better off just making sure everyone can fight and that you have at least 1 strength person and 1 INT/CHA person on the team.

FINAL:
Having played through the entire set of Adventure Packs 1-6. I can definitely say that this game got worse as it went on. The game gets progressively harder in terms of dice rolls but the decisions don't ever really feel meaningful. the game ends up boiling down to a soulless dice chucker that feels light on story/purpose, imbalanced in character skill use, and lacking depth.

Mmmmm, Bard's Tale II in card format!

This reminds me so much of that game.  Even though the mechanics are simple (play top card from turn deck, turn over a card, calculate dice needed to give you your best odds at matching or beating a number, roll 'em, discard card or shuffle it back in the stack, rinse and repeat with some nuances until the turn deck runs out or you beat the right card), it really feels like a level up dungeon crawl to me.  A fun one!

The complaints about the turn deck do not make sense to me.  I think that is because I have been mostly playing a character (Seelah) that can really use those cards (and it sure is sweet when they line up just right).

I also don't know why people are saying it is too easy.  I seem to have about a 50% success rate so far.  I have had only one game where the villain and henchmen were in the top 3 cards (4 locations and I have been seeing about 28-35 cards per game) and that makes a huge difference.  I think certain characters are more likely to be successful (hard to argue with a d10 + 3 combat check without a weapon)  I also don't help another character unless it is at the same location.

Why this is not a 10:
- I do not want to play it all the time - too many other great games out there!

I'm truly conflicted about this game.
On one hand, this was the game that marked my entry on modern boardgames. As such, it will always hold some significance.
However, while the campaign is fun for the first 1-3 adventure packs, it does start to get repetitive after a while. It does not help that it seems very combat oriented, and that the structure of the game always involves finding the villain in a very similar way. Furthermore, having played this game in a group of 3, I felt like my character - Ezren - was miles above any other character in the party, who rarely got significant loot, while I would always get an upgrade after every major encounter.

Given these two flaws, I can't rate the gamr higher than 5, even tough I would love to give it a greater. It's a great game for a certain niche of people, it just won't fit every taste.

A co-operative customisable adventure card game with a bunch of dice rolling. Quite a lot of fun, although I suspect it's set up to be a little easy - no-one wants to lose their character that they spent hours working on.

Like most games in the genre, there's a lot to take in on the first play and this makes it rather difficult to select a first character. But after a while it does come together.

RATING: 5.5
A [poor] attempt at turning the Adventure Paths that made Paizo great into a board game, or more precisely, into a Living Card Game.

What I really like about it is the deck management system (the deck is your life, you can bury cards, sacrifice them, etc.), and the Campaign mode [character advancement after each adventure, like RPG's campaigns].

I really wanted this to be a great game, but there are many things about I don't like:
-> Dice rolls are way too important (more important than in a RPG and way more important than in a regular board game).
-> Very low replay value (how can it be at this price and with so many cards??).
-> Some characters are unplayable in solo play.

I was on the verge of buying it when I saw it at a great price right after it was published. I'm very glad I didn't do it.

I don't see this taking the place of a good RPG or board game, but still, I'm willing to give it a try.

***********************

Edit: after trying it, I was wrong about the decisions. You actually have to take meaningful ones and there are enough of them to provide the game with some quite light tactic and strategic content. Still, it's true that most decissions are evident, depending on the characteristics of your character and the group.

Still, it's replayability is very low. Only three adventures on the base game and now that I have played one, I have almost no interest to play it again. Yes, the items and some encpounters would be different, but the key items and the atrategy will be the same. The most difference will be created by playing with different characters.

On the other side, the campaign mode is not that great. You just improve a single stat in a minor way.

I had fun during the game, I increased my rating from 4 to 5.5 (I punish very heavily the absolute lack of replayability and the very few scenarios).

Holy crap, this game can kick your team's ass the first few times round.  I've only completed one adventure so far, and it took us to die three times in a row before we finally understood some important tactics, like stick together till both players are comfortable and have solid hands.

Everytime I play I just want to keep going!  I thought I was going to dislike some of the commonly stated caveats like:
The combat is anti-climactic -
It sort of is, especially if you're not in the party/game.  But when you're the dwarf watching your elven friend facing off with a mean ogre you cringe when they roll that die, because you know there's a chance they're gonna get creamed.  It also makes the game feel fast and smooth!  The Health system feels right and when you start running out of cards you can feel that sense of urgency, you find yourself just following your friends around and you don't explore and beg for people to give you some heals.

BRING A HEALER!

I feel that if I could find a good solid group of people who will play an adventure or two with me once or twice a week this game could seriously become my new favorite.

E' un gioco articolato, bello corposo e interessante. Ma non è nelle mie corde. Innanzitutto è un cooperativo puro e a me fanno sempre storcere il naso, poi tra giri di carte e lanci di dadi vedo una presenza del caso oltre i limiti da me ammessi e quindi io passo, anche se l'ambientazione, i poteri differenti dei vari giocatori, le loro abilità, molto in stile gioco di ruolo, lo rendono un gioco interessante e piacevole.

From the basic mechanisms the game is only "ok" and a little repetitive, but the character progression is what makes this interesting enough for me. 
I usually don't care much for putting together decks/spellbooks etc. before a game, but in Pathfinder it feels almost like a part of the game, which makes it more interesting for me. 

There is also a big difference how interesting the different characters are to play. Some of the stronger ones just feel less interesting as it's usually even more obvious what to do.

This is the game I have been waiting for for years, without even knowing it. After a week since purchasing it, me and my wife, both avid RPG and board gamers, still can't resist having at least one game every evening after we stick the kids to bed. Each character plays differently, so each 2-player game is a new adventure. And, while impatient to have the new content in my hands, I actually appreciate the base set + regular expansions model, as it means we get an excellent game to start with, plus more goodies to come! Thumbs way up!

I have played a few times face to face and dozens of games on the iPad.  The game is very repetitive and isn't horribly deep so that equals a somewhat tedious game to play.  Face to face, I don't enjoy it that much for these reasons.   But solitaire on the iPad where you have a computer doing all the shuffling, calculating the die modifiers, it plays quick and I get to making the decisions that matter.

This is an enjoyable if slightly overpriced game IMO.   I like the way it captures the big dice rolls element from RPGs.  Fairly heavy internet use is required during first few plays to smooth out rules ambiguities. To be honest I have struggled to find players who enjoy this one as much as I do which is a shame.  As a result I've not played past the first 1-2 scenarios.

Update - The lack of coherent story arc is disappointing.  It's a shame because I think the game's mechanics are really solid.

The core of the game is solid : the way you build your character through various adventures by adding cards to your deck works well. 
But the adventure and campaign design is just asinine (yay, I used this word !! Not sure it means what I want to say...) and bland as hell. You don't get the narrative of the Runelords campaign, and the whole "chase the villain" pattern as a basis for almost EVERY scenario feels like a giant missed opportunity, since the core mechanic of the game seemed to open so much more design space. This should have been a scenario-based kind of sandbox. But it ends up as a constraining, repetitive and disapointing boardgame experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game seems rather simple initially, turn over a card and roll a die/dice, but there is more to it. 

Fascinating concept behind it all. The deck-levelling in itself is quite smart & the main reason that the game is not just roll a die and hope you get lucky, though there IS a lot of that.

In my opinion it is best as a solo game.

Sold it.

This is everything we want in an RPG without actually having to play a true RPG D&D style game with paper and pencil, we absolutely love the card mechanic and deck building in this game. Me and my wife thoroughly enjoy this lite RPG. The game plays quickly and smoothly and is a great gateway in the the RPG genre. We love the fact that we can play the 2 of us in under 60 mins and not feel like we are missing out on the experience because we don't have 4-6 players. The game seems to be extremely well balanced and well filled with content. All and all we love this dungeon delving, loot grabbing, dice rolling, check making, deck building, persistent character development coop adventure game!

RATING: 7
Have a character with your own deck of cards. On a turn, go to a location. Flip the top card of that location. Do its skill check by rolling the die your character tells you, and add more dice or bonuses using cards from your hands. Then either use card abilities to do more stuff or end your turn. Continue having turns around the table until someone finds a baddie at a location and defeats it, then roll a skill check to close the location down, reminiscent of Arkham Horror. When you find the big boss, he'll escape to a non-closed location, so basically you want to close stuff down until he's got nowhere to go, and then if you defeat him, you win the scenario. Next scenario, get new locations (each location has different special effects), build a new deck for each location, and go again. After each scenario, you wean your deck back to its starting configuration, but if you've found some better spells say at a location, you can choose to keep these and discard your starter spells, still getting you back to your max 3 spells or whatever. Which nicely ups your character as you work your way through scenarios which no doubt will get tougher as you go. That's quite cool. But the turns aren't much more than flip a card, roll a die. There's little co-op stuff you can do other than use cards to take some damage or add a die occasionally if you're at the same location. Happy to play again if I want to not think too much and just enjoy the company, but really it's for those who like this sort of thing.

RATING: 9
Neat system. A true-coop card game with an RPG feel and light deck-building mechanic. A little intuitive. Looking forward to more. I really like the decisions that crop up. This scratches my itch to play Runebound, Mage Knight, and Decipher's Star Wars CCG. Plays quicker than you think (except for a learning game).  Much errata and revisions, but I'm still loving this. The artwork is wonderful.

This comes with dice, but the games go faster when people bring their RPG dice along.

Probably not best with 2 player, though that is how I'm playing it mostly for now, and I'm finding it super fun. We hope to redo the paths with different character combos. I can't wait to try some paths solo.

For those not familiar to RPGs, there will be a learning curve.

RATING: 10
"Clever deck management fantasy adventure game with a good theme, and each hero plays quite differently. The gameplay is not as dull as some claim (it's NOT 'flip a card; roll dice; repeat'), but it's not fantastic either. The charm of this game, and the only reason it shines, is if you campaign over multiple sessions, watching your character grow, and eagerly awaiting new stuff to encounter. I went in with fairly low expectations, but it has become a favorite. My wife and I finished a campaign, and have started going through a second time. Unfortunately it doesn't really work solo with one character. After over 100 plays, and wanting more, this has become the second game I have ever rated a 10. "

What I like:
- Different characters play very differently
- Clever mechanism of cards-in-deck = hit points
- Can play quickly (learning 2p game took under an hour; second scenario took 2 hours)
- The idea of leveling up over multiple sessions
- Avoids the co-op cliche of "each turn, flip a card to advance evil"
- I'm a sucker for fantasy adventure games

What I don't like:
- Remembering the special rules for each location AND the scenario can be tricky
- There are a lot of FAQ and errata issues to remember
- Solo play with one hero is not great
- It can be hard to get a group to commit to a campaign
- Heroes eventually hit a ceiling and must be retired (after 33 scenarios)
- It's not cheap
- Early on, armor seems underpowered (later it gets better)
- Solo with one character is too frustrating, so I would rate that about a 4

After my first game, I wasn't all that impressed. But reflecting back, I found myself thinking more positively about it. After a couple more plays, and seeing my character start to get stronger, I was convinced. It's not my favorite game, but I'm still very much enjoying it. It's one of the few games my wife asks to play. 

There is a fair bit going on, so this is not a light or gateway game. However, it's not crazy complicated either. Once you understand it, it plays smoothly and quickly, although I wish there were fewer things to remember each scenario (or that they could all be listed in one place somehow). I agree with the BGG-voted weight of 2.7.

Bloody marvelous a brilliant game plays so well and can't wait to see the next five adventure packs ...
I have revised down my initial 10 to a five as I now have more handwriting on my rule book than type and until a new living rules is posted it will stay at five as I am fed up of annotating my rule book ...so please Mr publisher update the rules book !

Raised up to 7 from 5 started as 10 ... almost there!!

It would be a ten if a solution to errated cards comes forth ...I would be happy with PDFs so long as I don't have to write on my cards ...new rule book a little better but still needs either a full index or glossary ...

The amount of errata will keep this at current rating ...shame so much !

Absolutely loving this. You really get drawn into the game story (if you're even the least bit willing and I assume you are if the game appealed to you at all) filling in gaps and fleshing out the narrative.

The cards are a good quality and thick although I can see that they will chip over time from the constant handling and shuffling

So far, I've only played a solo campaign with 2 characters, and I've only gotten 3 scenarios down (so far), but I'm really enjoying it!  I think the game perfectly captures the essence of a role-playing game, funneling it into card-play and mechanics, and it beautifully re-creates the character-building aspect of a campaign.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After first try: 

We played the first scenario with three players, one left and then we played one more scenario with two players. 

First impression is that i like it. It's not much game, not much strategy, more a 3x (or 2,5x) fun to explore and expand (find stuff and level up) adventure. Since the theme is perfect for me, and I like 3x, with or without game strategy it works for me. 

Even though the game mechanics are simple they do appeal to me, they are nicely implemented. 

(added 2014-11-18) Have played it a few more times now. I like tha game. the theme suits me, and it's close enough to role playing (besides just role playing) to appeal to me in the same way role playing does. 

The major downside of the game is that it is not really replayable. you play it once, and with all expansions once will mean several sessions, but it becomes an expansive game (per play). I have all expansions for the first campaign, but will not buy the second campaign. Hopefully I will get to play part two anyway with friends that own it.

I was thinking Pathfinder might turn out to be an 8 after three solo sessions, but after three 4-player sessions, I've settled on a rating of 7, and it's trending downward.  I'm not sure if it's got enough to keep us interested.  I will keep playing solo for a few more scenarios to see if things improve.

[Update: 9.20.13]
Downgraded to a 6, still trending downward.  There just aren't enough interesting decisions in this game to keep me engaged solo, and group play did not wow me either.  I have some vestigial urge to finish out the Burnt Offerings adventure path, but more out of stubborness to finish what I started instead of a real desire to play the game.  When I have time to solo game, Pathfinder crosses my mind, but I quickly find myself wanting to play a different game such as Friday, Mage Knight or Space Hulk: Death Angel.

I am still figuring out the rules and playing the solo game at the moment and like the look and feel of the game. However, there are printer issues with the cards. A few of them have red tracks or light black misting on the front. C'mon guys! Quality control! Plus some of the colours are a bit flat and bland. Compare the look of this game with LOTR Card Game and it loses. A shame because Paizo are usually great at presentation.

Ok after 7 solo games I am addicted. This game is epic! It is just the right thing for me because I often want a short game that has the RPG feel and can't persuade anyone to play :)

Plus, I really love the way you character develops through getting better equipment and fulfilling quests.

Will it become repetitive? I am on the Skinsaw Murders and yes, it is becoming a bit repetitive.

I have completed Burnt Offerings 3 or 4 times with different characters and it is becoming a little repetitive so I have lowered the score a teeny bit.

Not much to say about this except it's pure awesomeness.  Some setup time required.  This game can be heavy decision making on resource use or it can be straight gung ho go get em.  Either way it's played, it's alot of fun, and the fact that the characters grow in power (ever so slightly) each time a new scenario is played makes it incredibly addictive.

This can be played by non gamers and enjoyed, because rules do not become overwhelming in this game.

A LOT of fun initially, Plays superbly solo with 2 characters. I've always been a sucker for games with character progression and this is great. Not cheap by the time you buy the 6 add on packs to complete the adventure path. But divide it by the amount of playtime plus it's superior solo playability (second only to Mage Knight the boardgame for me) and I can justify it to myself. I would question the expense to anyone who is only 'meh' about RPG's though.
The repetitive nature of play soon killed the game for me though.

This would be a 10, but I'm concerned that the expansions aren't going to add enough variety to the game play. It seems like most of the scenarios just involve finding and trapping the slippery Mastermind Monster. A cool mechanic, but I can see it getting really same-y after a while. Also, the amount of errata and clarifications that were needed is beyond ridiculous. I'll be watching to see what Paizo does with the next base set. And I'll probably wind up shoveling over my cash. The whole deck building your character thing is too geeky to resist.

The fact that the scenario mechanics are simple means you could design your own adventures with your own objectives to keep things interesting. And, though the box is enormous, the insert is fantastic. Quickly becoming a family favorite.

Playtime: ~75-90 minutes a scenario

Comment: Not quite sure this is 10 material, but it is damn good. The characters feel different, the locations are vastly different, weapons/spells/armor are awesome and the artwork is great. My only downside is that monsters feel a bit samey and from what I've seen there isn't a whole lot of connection between the stuff you're fighting/looting in locations. You kind of have to make up a story in your head on why you found a treasure chest in the middle of the forest for example.

I do like that death is permanent and working together is a MUST. Now, my only concern is how to sleeve this puppy.

[b]Update:[/b] Alright, after playing this game around a dozen more times I've really fallen in love with this game. I'm not even sure why, since the game essentially boils down to move, flip a card, roll some dice. There really isn't a story involved and you really have to conjure up a narrative. But god damn is this game addicting. We played it 6 times in a row which is freaking unheard of with ALL my games I've played. Only rivals Dominion in that aspect.

I do feel this game shines with 3-5 players though and 2 or 6 feels a bit lacking/constrained. It does scale well and I will easily play with 1-6, but 3-5 is the sweet spot.

I also really enjoy trying to make a narrative out of the events and creatures that come up. Some are a bit difficult to create, but others fall in place and the game shines when it does. Really hoping for other variations on the "close locations/defeat baddie" that seems to be most/all scenarios. 

Optimal Player Count: 4 >= 5 > 3 > 6 > 2 > 1
Plays equally well with all player counts, but I prefer the 3-5 range. 6 is tight, 2 and 1 is lacking unless you control 2+ characters each.

Variants Used: Slow card mix and little scenario tweaks that add more flavor. We also make death less permanent as losing a character can suck ass and jumping into a scenario is also fine.

Wasn't expecting much from this game but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Much better than expected. It's simple, but compelling to play due to the focus on progression, and building your characters up over time. 

It's a card game not a GM-less rpg like some people were thinking. It's more mechanical than narrative but there is some of that.

Rules and rules on the cards could have been written better with more clarity, but it's the guys first card game so I'll cut him some slack. Nothing game breaking or show stopping. Just a little annoying to have to go online to figure somethings out.

The game so far has been very enjoyable and we look forward to continuing.

I wanted to love this, I really did. Building up a party of characters within a light RPG campaign setting is my very favourite thing. Pathfinder ACG does parts of this well and seems promising at first. But the story-telling is non-existent, the mechanics non-thematic and the gameplay becomes repetitive. I gave it a good go, and I enjoyed it quite a bit at times - but it felt like a chore after a while, and I didn't have the heart to finish the full campaign.

Well, I finally got to play the darling of last year. It’s about what I expected, even perhaps a little better. I had a fun time playing, and the campaign system is interesting enough that I’d like to go back to it, but almost everything done in-game is done better by LotR The Card Game, Fantasy Flight’s LCG. I don’t have room in my life (or budget) for another constantly-expanding product like this.

Got to play this hot game at my local meetup. I've played a 2 player game and the game owner's scenario. We played the 3rd senario of the base game. He wasn't expecting a company but I can see he does enjoy a change of scene. He said he only brought 1 set of dice because he was going to play solo at the meetup. =( aww. Anyway I had a blast playing this game. It feels like the closest you can get to playing an RPG game with cards. I understand the criticism of this game but there are some meaningful decisions involved in this game instead of just flip and card and roll dice. We need to do some memorization of the cards layout at each location and also some probability math in our heads with the dice roll and a bit of deck building knowledge in the order that we play and discard cards. I think if I am really bored I will probably get this game to pass time.

The dice tower convinced me to buy this game. The expansions convinced me that it could only get better. The ability to "level up" your party was intriguing to me. But in reality the game is relentless on dice rolls (in which the base set doesn't provide enough of). The base set box is ridiculously huge, the box needs to be flat on the shelf otherwise the cards need to be sorted every time you open it. It was one of my greater board game disappointments.

A card game based on one of my favorite RPGs, with a persistent campaign system, character-building, the risk of perma-death, and a ton more.  At first glance, this game may appear to be a "flip a card, roll dice to beat the check" game, but it is so much more.  The cooperative elements can't be overstated.  Blessings, spells, and other items from your fellow players make all the difference between success and failure, and every choice matters.

Playing it solo. First scenario with two characters, added third character for the next.  Plays easily, although some things are a bit unclear at first reading.  Specifically the way Blessing of the Gods works.  But really loving this game. I think the dice are what really makes it for me.  Becomes less of a puzzle than most co-op games.

12/27/13 - Love this game and initially rated a 10 but after playing through a few times (playing first adventure with 9 of 12 characters), I am wondering how they can sustain interest in the gameplay over the 6 adventure packs if you are doing the exact same thing everytime (finding a boss and killing it).  Looking at the character sheets, there's not even that much more cool loot to pick up as you go alons so what's the reason to keep playing?  I may be wrong but at this point I'm lowering to a 9 and we'll how this plays out.

A unique game. Pretty simple overall, but offers up some new ideas. You pick a card, you see what it is, you roll dice, and you win or lose. There are a few decisions to be made, but not a ton.

The game tries to tell a story, and sometimes succeed and other times fails. It gives you dots you can connect together, but sometimes those dots are way out of left field and ruin the suspension of disbelief.

What is interesting is the campaign and permanent death. As you play, you character acquires cards which can be used. At the end of the game, you recreate your deck using these new cars. So you're constantly adding and changing, leveling up, and becoming stronger. It's fun to watch it play out over an adventure. And it makes choices later harder because the death of your character means you're starting over.

The rules are a mess, and the errata is too many for my tastes. It's totally workable, but it's just not CLEAN in any way. It has a "play it like it makes sense" attitude, which I don't care for.

I really want to like this game. I've played the first few scenarios a few times, solo with either two or three characters. I like the mechanics of recharging cards to retain weapons/powers; I like the art work on the cards, especially the items and weapons; and the games moves along at a decent pace, with each scenario's maximum length being determined by the size of the blessing card deck. I just haven't had the feeling of story progression as I'd hoped and I haven't yet become attached to the characters. Still, I have now bought all of the Rise of the Runelords adventure decks, so I will start again when I tire of my current 'games of the moment'.

Yes, I've played the card game and I look forward to playing it more with my son. But... the iOS app is an absolute stunner - although a bit buggy - and really makes this game shine. No shuffling, too!

First set of adventures is fun with goblins, getting used to running around Sandpoint: good low-level scrappage. Print off the character mats for ease of reading (those cards have some tiny text on 'em!).

Pseudo RPG card game, where the deck-building takes place post-level as a part of your leveling process. Different quests can start to feel a little same-y. I also refuse to write on the cards to level them up, which means unwieldy printouts are necessary. The game has a lot of things that needed errata and there aren't enough cards to support all the different characters having decks at the same time.

I should also mention that thematically the game seems to work best without the character expansion pack. With just the base game, you get four different characters with four different themes that are designed to work in tandem with each other. The addon characters from the pack are hybrids and solo style people, who work against the fun of the group as a whole.

Wonderful.  A quick RPG adventure smooshed down into a card game.  Already a contender for game of the year 2013 (for me anyway).  Score could be adjusted if they can't keep it fresh with the ideas, but I'm hopeful.  Worried more about wearing the cards out than anything else.  

Update:  I scored this a 10 at first, but as I'm nearing the last adventure, I'm less compelled by it than I was initially.  Yes, it is still an RPG in thirty minutes...but it is a very fight-heavy RPG.  Most of the "role playing" happens in your head, which can be fun, but it still sometimes feels like a grind.  My two-man team is pretty much just walking through the adventures at this point and sort of getting excited when new loot shows up, but other than that, it is more "Diablo" than "Pathfinder".  
Also, Paizo's losing a point for not carrying characters over from set to set.  Extremely disappointing development.  It basically makes RotR a legacy (read: one-shot) game for me and my crew.  
Down to 8, guys.  Sorry.  I'll give the next set a try, but it'll be my last if we can't work out something to bring back our developed and, dare I say it, loved characters from older sets.

Got this and all of the adventure decks for a good deal to play solo. I think this game thrives on interaction with other players. Not a great solo game as you don't have a whole lot of choices as to what happens to you.

RATING: 8
Definitely feels like what I used to play years ago, MMORPGs. Being able to trade items and level up and fight more difficult monsters/henchmen/villians.

WARNING: DO NOT PLAY SOLO WITH ONE CHARACTER, the experience will be underwhelming.

Deaths: Valeros and Harsk at Foul Misgivings

Savepoint: Kyra and Ezren entering 6-2, We went to 6-4 after 6-1 and realised that only after we defeated the scenario. 

Thoughts after playing up till Deck 6: It's a game where you don't use much brains and just hope you don't get a bad roll. Superb for a relaxed friday night after work where we play about 1-3 scenarios weekly.

Ezren and Kyra completed the adventure!!

RATING: 7.5
7.5 - What I really like about this game is it captures the magic of a pathfinder RPG and gives the sense of a party working together to defeat some villain and his posse without needing a DM and I love the mini-deck building thing it has going on. A couple of minor drawbacks however are that each mission is basically the same, even though the bonuses and penalties of the locations change if you're playing with the same crew each time you'll play with the same number of locations and players and though the henchmen and bosses are different they aren't distinctive.  Furthermore, since you're shuffling the same cards in each scenario you potentially get the same usual suspects each time, we've seen the shadow, the gecko, and the harpy in every single scenario we've run. 

Our regular group lost interest midway through the 4th pack and there hasn't been any desire to go back to it. It's highly repetitive.

RATING: 6.5
Innovative and exciting design. I feel like this is going to kick open the doors for others to take what's been done here, further it, and create some really great systems for matching table-top RPGs with the more streamlined approach of a boardgame..

The scenario's start to feel a bit same-samey pretty quickly, as things tend to play out similarly from one game to the next - you chase the bad-guys through various locations and hope to eventually corner and defeat the head villain - with very little variation.

I am generally left wishing there had been a bit more depth and tension to the proceedings. 

It is, however, great fun to get some of the thrills that a classic table-top RPG can offer, such as character advancement, gaining new spells, weapons and allies and just being able to watch, as you play through multiple sessions, that time and experience are truly adding up as your character becomes more and more a force to be reckoned with..

Very much looking forward to seeing the future of this system.

So, at first I rated this a 6.  It was good fun.  It does not do well with multiple plays.  My party is on the five Adventure and it is seemingly a bit too easy and we made some mistakes early on that might be why it is too easy.  That being said, this is not that great of a game.  It is fun for a time.  Now we are going to plow through this to finish it.  The thing is. . . . why not just play an RPG!

It's what people who haven't played RPG's think an RPG is like...lots of dice rolling and skill checks. However, the heart of an RPG is the narrative, and that is missing from this game.  Those who have played RPG's will recognize this immediately; those who have not will feel like they have found the RPG experience they were always looking for, but never had the time (nor people) to play with.    

That being said, it's not a BAD game for what it is. The character development aspect, in particular, is unique. I just personally found it a bit souless and bland.

Early plays made me rate it as 8.5.  Since then, I've played barely anything else, with other games largely having to fit in around Pathfinder sessions.  I'm liking it a lot. 

The game isn't without it's flaws - although we have found the difficult yet level is pitched perfectly, there is some luck, some cards you rarely see yet others are used over and over again, and there's quite  a bit of setup time.  But this has to be my favourite co-op game AND my favourite adventure game.  And it's easily the best game of 2013 for me.

Edit - and more than halfway they 2014 we're still playing the game.  And still not understanding how others are finding it too easy - our success rate is less than 50%, and we had one permanent death :(

Move, roll as many dice as possible, move again roll more dice. This game somehow managed to pull off a MASSIVE amount of hype, I bought in and played a bunch of games but after a few plays you can see through to what this game really is. I like the persistent character idea but that ultimately fails in the end. Great concept and idea but fell flat for me.

This is a card game that somewhat captures the D&D feel and allows solitaire play. A typical session runs 1 hour with 2 characters. I would have rated it a 9.0, but the production values in printing color variations between the base decks and the add-on decks vary slightly in color.

RATING: 5
I found this game to be very monotonous. After the first two plays I was completely bored with it. As much as I wanted to build my character and go through the story, I just couldn't because all you are doing is closing stacks of cards and trying to find the boss. Boring. When I play D&D I love story telling and character building. When I play board games I love theme, mechanics, and strategy. This game doesn't scratch my D&D itch or my board game itch. I would not play this game even if asked because there is no point unless you are going to play through the 20-40 game campaign and I absolutely refuse to do that. If I could play this game as a single game every blue moon I would, and it would be okay; but since the only real point of this game is character building and conquering the story, there is no point. I won't ever play it again.

This is a difficult game for me to rate.  It's so much fun, but I can't figure out why.  

I love the deck management aspect of the game: Deck is your life, discarding cards is like losing HP, but many times it's necessary to do that to get to a good hand of cards that you can hold on to and use.  There's a bit of risk-reward there.  

I love the character progression between games, finding and using better weapons, items, allies and spells as you go as well as getting dice and card modifiers for various skills and your deck as you progress. It's all very cool.  

On the other hand, I've played 8 games and 4 different scenarios so far, and it's not at all difficult or challenging beating these scenarios.  There's obviously quite a bit of luck involved, but I'm hoping these scenarios get increasingly more difficult as the campaign progresses.  

Interestingly, even though the difficulty isn't really there, I still tread carefully with my decisions.  As I'm playing, I feel like the choices I make are valid and important, but at the end of the scenario, I still seem to have plenty of blessings left in the blessing (timer) deck and typically, my characters aren't on the brink of death.  That may have to do with the fact that the party I'm mainly playing with is a solo campaign with only two heroes and one is a healer.  Also, the other one got lucky and has the holy candle which can lengthen the blessings deck if needed.  

Anyway, despite the fact that the scenarios aren't tough to beat, I'm still having loads of fun playing this game.  It's strange.  Logic is telling me I should be bored with this game due to the lack of a real challenge.  I suppose in the case of PACG, there's something that I can't put my finger on.  Is it that I actually care about the characters and their progression from scenario to scenario?  I'm not sure.  There's some sense of story here, but it also has a randomness to it that takes away from a cohesive tale.  

I don't think I would ever "hate" this game, but I can't believe I love it as much as I do.

There are some issues with the rules and card errata that stops this from ever getting a 10 rating.  The lack of a real challenge brings it down another notch.  If I rated this game purely on "fun", it would probably be a 10.  For now, I think an 8 makes sense.  If this feeling of fun dissipates, my rating could drop.  If the scenarios start to become more challenging, my rating could increase.

UPDATE - Just finished Approach to Thistletop scenario in my solo campaign with Harsk and Kyra.  Beat this scenario by the skin of my teeth and the decisions became pretty tough towards the end as both characters were down to 1 - 2 cards in their decks.  Decisions about playing blessings, weapons and spells to aid the other player became very tough.  Also burning blessings to get the characters together to attempt to heal before the final battle with the villain was all very thematic, tense and fun. THIS is what I was hoping for and expecting out of this game.  My hope is that Thistletop Delve is just as tough and exciting and that the rest of the adventure packs keep with this level of strategy, theme and tension.  If they do continue in this vein, my rating may easily increase to a 9.

Update (after 17 plays) - Thisteltop Delve was crazy difficult.  I'm into Skinsaw now, loving this game - bumped rating to 9.

Le jeu en lui-même est plutôt simple, voire simpliste. Le tour d'un joueur peut être décrit comme suit:
- on avance le compteur de temps
- on révèle une carte
- on effectue un jet de dés, on applique les conséquence suivant selon le succès ou l'échec.

Par conséquent, quelqu'un pourra tout à fait trouver le jeu assez ennuyeux et répétitif.
Maintenant, comme avec de nombreux jeux de cartes maintenant, chaque carte modofie légèrement les règles et ajoute un peu de saveur à l'histoire. De plus, chaque personnage a sa propre personnalité.
En outre, le système de progression des personnages est très bien fait et l'évolution de votre personnage donne beaucoup de satisfaction. Comme dans un jdr.

Jusqu'à présent je n'ai joué le jeu qu'avec des joueurs de jdr, il faudra que je le teste avec des joueurs de jeux de plateau.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

The game in itself is rather simple. One's turn can be described as follow:
- you advance the time counter
- you draw a card
- you make a dice roll, according to success or failure you execute the consequence.

As a consequence one could find the game quite boring and repetitive.
Now, as with many card games now, each card twists the rules a bit, add some flavour to the story, each character has his own personality. 
Additionally the progression of the characters is quite well done and the evolution of your character gives you a lot of satisfaction. Like in RPG.

The game is best experienced with a group of gamers that can continue the story together and build their decks over time. Most of my experience has been playing single scenarios, and it seems to lose a lot of it's charm resetting the decks for every mission. Still, I can see the beauty in it's design and I'm excited for more content to come out for this unique game. I've even bought the iconic Pathfinder miniatures to replace the character cards.

For a non RPG player like myself this fits a missing slot in my collection, I like the idea of character progression over a long campaign of Adventures .I would love to give a perfect 10 but the amount of rules questions this throws up is ridiculous for such a simple game, would it have been so hard to put an icon on each card that could be used out of turn for example, saving pages of rule questions! 
Super game non the less.

I, along with my two sons (age 13 and 10), have been having a lot of fun with this game.  It's relatively simple but there's a good bit of variation between scenarios.  It's fun to see your "character" evolve and improve as you gain and lose cards from your deck from session to session.

The boys in particular have enjoyed the game - so much so they are recruiting other friends into playing it on their own.  If you enjoy the fantasy theme, or have kids who do, I think it's a great game to pick up.

Great RPG(ish) card game. Lots of heroes to choose from. Bit of a dice fest but a good balance of luck and planning. Base sets retail at £25 a throw and add-ons £12 a pack.
So total coast for one SET is in the order of £85; not including character decks and the 5-6 player add-on.

Lots of replay. VERY fiddly for the card set, you need a good box organiser in order to manage the various card types.

Some games go to the very last card turn / dice throw.

I don't mind the long setup process, but some will. 

There is strategy in how to work through the various location decks and if/when to collaborate. Characters are very different and will affect your strategy.

I think that luck outweighs strategy though. Especially how deep the henchmen are within the location decks and how early/late you encounter the villain.

Characters can keep items they've collected after a game victory, but they'll quickly accumulate the best items so future victories are more hollow.

Death seems inevitable if luck is not on your side, so your character will lose the items they fought so hard to acquire.

It's very easy to misinterpret the cards. I'm still referring to forums for clarification.

This is a brilliant card game. It is very abstract so I would not call it a dungeon crawler but the mechanics are deep and yet simple to learn.

There are tons of expansion options and you can really develop your characters in many different ways. I think it is an easier game as I don't seem to lose too much but with permadeath an actual possibility perhaps making it as hard as games like the Lord of the Rings LCG would just be too frustrating.

Also it is excellent value for what you get in the base set.

My bias against co-operatives probably knocks a couple points off. Though this one is as unengaging as the rest of its genre, it is a very clever port of the Pathfinder RPG character system to a card game. The tension comes from the pressure of beating the scenario vs the metagame pull of loot acquisition. I suppose the inevitable scenario expansions and new loot cards will be the draw here. But I'm afraid there's not enough game here to keep me coming back.

Played Allen's set a bit over the summer of 2014 with him and with my son.  It's a fun game for sure.  I'm worried that it might become too samey, but my biggest concern is that it became too easy as our characters improved.

8. Initial rating after our first campaign attempt.  Very enjoyable & easy to learn. Can't wait to play it again!

After several more plays, changing rating to a 9. Only played base scenario with various friends so far, each time has felt different and each character has unique attributes which compliments various team combinations.

Having played the entire first campaign, reducing rating to 7.9 as no new mechanics introduced.

This game sounds impressive.  All reviews I've watched on Youtube are positive and exciting.  I think this is mainly due to it being very new and not much actual playing going on yet.  

After playing a few scenarios (2/3 of the game as shipped), it became painfully obvious to me that the game lacks depth--big time.  There are 500 cards but really not a whole lot of variation when you actually look at what is meaningful.  If you play this game, you will understand.  Scenarios are 'different' but they are really all the same--that's not exaggeration either.  There is really no story, only a descriptive paragraph or two on adventure, scenario, and location cards.  It's just bland and definitely lacking the 'adventure' portion of the title.

The real kicker is that your success or failure is mainly determined by whether the Villain and Henchmen you are searching for in the 'location' decks are near the top or near the bottom.  If too many are near the bottom, you will run out of turns and lose.  If most are near the top, you will win absent some sort of act of God affecting your dice rolls.

The concept sounds good and probably could be good, but this game doesn't get there and I can't imagine anyone wanting to finish this game much less replay or expand their game when the expansions are available, unless you like rote, unimaginative card turning and dice rolling and then maybe this is for you.

I was frankly surprised at all the high ratings for this game after buying it (and going by those ratings in my decision to purchase it)and playing it. Perhaps boardgamers in general are very easy to impress or very hesitant to criticize.  I firmly believe with time this game's rating will drop like a rock to where it really belongs.

Short review:
As a recovering video game addict I needed a solo game that gave me a RPG feel without the digital addiction. PACG is excellent. It is more abstract than a "pure" RPG, but having multiple characters and a solid story-line give a real story feel to the game. There are multiple characters to choose from to play, each of which each give a slightly different mechanic to the game so it is also re-playable.

The base game is about $50, but getting the entire game and all its expansion packs will run you a total of about $120. However, when I had completed the story with 2 groups of 3 characters each, it had taken me 2 years, making it a worth while investment. My overall cost ended up at under $1 per hour of fun: not at all bad and I'm planning on replaying the game multiple times with different storylines: there are additional stories you can get for free (or pay for) to make it re-playable, or just play again with different characters in the base game.

It can be a challenging game, if you are a casual game player, but you probably are not... Your character can die, for example. Yes, 50 hours into a 100 hour game, your character can die. You can start over, or bring them back with none of their gear or advancements (good luck...) but you are dead. You can house-rule this away if you wish, but it doesn't feel right to me if you do. A few characters died and my team left them behind and completed the story without them, but one character who died was my favorite so I restarted the game to get her back up to speed, which was depressing.

But when I actually completed the whole game with my 2 groups in the final story, it felt pretty satisfying...

Long review:
OK, so you're a grognard, die hard RPG player or just not sure about the whole game, so here it is:

The base set is $50 and comes with enough characters to play 9 different stories (called Scenarios). There are 5 other adventures numbered 2 - 6.

Each complete story is called an Adventure Path, this one is called "Rise of the Runelords", which is made up of 1 - 6. Each pack (1 - 6) is called an Adventure and each gaming session in each Adventure is called a scenario. The base set comes with 2 adventure paths, one of which has only 4 Adventures, all the rest have 5 each. Included in the box is a very short (4 scenario) adventure (explicably) labeled "B". Starting with #1 of "Rise of the Runelords", each Adventure has 5 scenarios. The box comes with B and 1. The other Adventures will cost about $15 each on sale and all together make a continuous story which you will take your group of 1 - 6 characters together to complete.

This means the complete game has 34 total scenarios. Each scenario takes around 2 hours to complete and about a 50% failure rate means the entire game would take over 100 hours to complete with 2 or 3 people playing together (or a solo player controlling them all...).

You pick a pre-made character in the box and give them gear. The magic user needs spells, the fighter needs a sword, etc. Each of these items is represented by a card, which is owned by the character. At the beginning of each scenario, your character(s) have 15 cards each to use in the game.

As you advance through the story, the characters get new powers, more available cards and abilities and increase their stats. You have some control over your characters choices in this regard, though it's usually best to play to their strengths.

Setup is kind of a bear. Lots of shuffling. I'm used to it now, but it takes getting used to. Practice, turn on some music and spend 20 minutes from unboxing to playing. The good news is, while you progress and cards go out of play, you can just put them right in the box, so cleanup is less work (but still 10 minutes or so).

You read the story, a tiny blurb on the back of the Adventure Path and Scenario cards, which set the stage for what you are trying to accomplish in the next part of the story. The adventure scenario tells you which locations to use (setup the City Gate and Apothecary, etc.) and then you put the monsters and barriers and boons (such as more and different spells, weapons, items, etc.) in the locations along with villains and henchmen and shuffle the location deck. Each character gets a turn to go to a different location, encounter the monsters and barriers, try to acquire the boons for your character and count down the timer (usually 30 turns each scenario). If you don't complete the scenario objectives in the allotted time, you lose and must replay again.

Most adventures have a villain and henchmen that are unique to that story and most of the time the goal of the story is to defeat the villain within the time limit. The stories are varied and some of them are more like a puzzle than just a simple "kill the bad guy" goal, so I found it varied and interesting. Having said that, there are now a total of 4 of the box sets ("Rise of the Runelords" is the first) and the other 3 are more challenging than this one. A serious grognard (or group of them) is likely to need to NOT play to their greatest advantage or much of the game will be too easy. If you are a grognard (serious, strategic player) you don't need to house rule to make it more challenging, simply choose some of the less optimum characters and see if you can complete the story with those. Try some roleplaying instead of just looking at the stats and it will be a challenge.

If you are on the fence about this purchase, you can try the digital version of the game for free. It is called "Pathfinder Adventures" and available on iTunes and Android.

Some other things you may want or need:
1. The "Character Add-on Pack" gives you a few extra and varied characters to play with (or to expand the game to 6 total concurrent players) as well as some varied monsters and boons (such as a very nice crossbow...) which are not present in the base game. However, this pack is by no means needed.

2. Extra dice. The dice included are good but I wanted more of them. These are cheap.

3. Ultra-Pro Clear Deck Protector Sleeves - Standard Magic the Gathering Size. The game tells you to write on the character cards in pencil, which is crazy. Just sleeve the character cards, not the whole game. I played the entire game through and never ruined a card (but I don't have kids or anything either...). As your character progresses, you can mark off the advancements you choose on the sleeve with a marker, not on the card itself.

4. Broken Token organizer for the box. I finished the entire game (all 6 adventure paths in this game with 2 groups of 3 characters each) without it, but when I bought my next box set (Skull and Shackles) I added the Broken Token and I'm glad I did.

5. There are other "Class Decks" for sale, which, if you play this game often and want to play it through multiple times, may be worth buying but they are not really needed. They are more for people who visit a friends house (or a gaming store) and want to play with their own portable character. I have a couple of these and, though good, don't add too much to the base game really. The best characters for each box set is already present in the base game (and its add on pack) so don't feel you're missing something if you don't buy any "Class Decks".

6. There are a couple of extra stories you can buy and play when you are totally done with this game. They are called The Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild at Paizo dot com. You buy the extra stories there and then you can buy the extra cards needed at drivethrucards dot com too, making the entire game replayable with the existing characters and cards, for a tiny investment (relatively speaking).

7. There are free stories at Welbybumpus dot com which use the existing box and cards and add a new story to the game.

8. There are, as of this review, 3 other complete adventures available: "Skull and Shackles", "Wrath of the Righteous" and "Mummies Mask". You do not continue from this adventure into those ones, they are complete adventures on their own and you start over again. You can reuse characters from Rise of the Runelords in those adventures if you wish (and vice versa) but there is no need to. Other than that, there is no real overlap between the 4 complete box sets.

9. The story is only loosely told on the scenario cards, but if you want to get more backstory, there are some well written documents on boardgamegeek dot com that you can read to get more flavor text. The one by Autoduelist is probably the best and gives you more motivation for the story.

8.30.13 I just got this and it was highly anticipated. It gets an instant 10 from me. This may go down after some plays but for now it's a 10.
9/12.13 I have played now solo, two player, and 4 players. I think two player is the sweet spot as the game does not drag too much. I love that I can get a RPG itch (lightly) scratched in solo play. I'm not expecting this game to be an actual RPG or expect it to do more than it is.... and with that I am truly satisfied.
This games is more of a card management game with an RPG lite theme, dice, and an objective. For me it does just what I want it to. Looking forward to future missions packs to see if they expand the look at locations to find bad guy mechanic.

This game is little more than "flip a card and roll a die to see if you beat it". The leveling of your character is a joke, since the enemies level up at exactly the same rate -- the end result, of course, is that it's the same game at any level.

This game was a missed opportunity.

I find it's mostly what you make of it.  If you play it as a straight card game, just turning over cards and "i beat it" or "nope, i lose" etc... Then it can get very repetitive and boring.  On the other hand, if you truly take the time to read the story behind the scenarios, put yourself there and imagine traveling to these locations and exploring them... Encountering the various things... Play it out in your mind as if it were an RPG, then that's when it really shines and becomes a WONDERFULLY fun and addictive game.  This is hands down my son's favorite game at this point and he wants to play it quite often.

I really, really, really am not sure what I think of this game. 

I played it twice solo. The first time, was horrible. The second time, it was ok. It was a tad repetitive.. and there was almost no game. I mean, its not complex enough for a deckbuilder. There is not enough story to drag you in and become an RPG-like experience. There are not enough meaningful choices to make it a good game..

Compared to MageKnight, it is not nearly as epic. Compared to DnD boardgames (Drizzt and the like) it lacks a board and the spatial navigation element. Compared to RPGs, it lacks story.

It's not bad.. but it certainly seems not to be my cup of tea. I am willing to give this a few other chances. I realy, really wanted to like it. I just currently don't.

==== Update after third play ==

It's starting to grow on me. I like it a lot better playing it with someone else. The game is pretty and if you don't see it as a deckbuilder, it's actually pretty enjoyable (and can get tense!).

I think my rating (6.5) may increase after more plays (went from 5 up already).

At first, I would have rated this game a 5.  I really did not like how the character card deck represented health.  It is particularly troubling that if you take damage and that makes you lose your weapons, you are pretty much screwed the rest of the scenario.  That is usually a game-ender.  However, after researching on the BGG forums I found out the real strategy is in hand/deck management.  If you manage your deck well and play your turn accordingly, you should never have to worry about losing all your weapons.  There is a lot of hidden strategy here which is not readily apparent from reading the rules.  If you are going to play this game, I highly recommend reading through the forum.

Added bonus, Paizo has the adventure/scenario card schematics available on their website.  You can create your own adventures after you complete all the ones that go with this game.

Pathfinder offers many things that I enjoy.  Card game.  Dice rolling.  Deck pooling.  Dungeon & Dragons based game play.  Cooperative versus the game.  All of those are things that enjoy.  Yet overall this game falls flat due to a rather dull experience.

Pathfinder does have many positive factors.  The artwork is well done and the card stock is nice and thick.  Even the box is cool and has a lovely and incredibly workable insert.

The theme fits the game rather well too.  It works great with the leveling system and campaign play.

The rules are well written and learning the game from the rule book is easy.  

The campaign system is an interesting gameplay mechanic.  It adds replayability and increasing difficulty.  Playing the expansions in order is a must.  While the campaign does add a lot of replayability I don't think it make the game any more replayable once the campaign is complete.  One run through the campaign is plenty.

But after that the game gets rather dull.  Nothing is bad.  Everything is very nice.  The gameplay is tight.  It's just not exciting.

The game is basically a series of playing cards to modify, or add, dice to checks required to continue.  Each required check might be different in name, like an Enemy, or a Trap, or to find an Item, but in the end it is the same mechanic repeatedly.

This turns the game into a straight math game.  Simply do the math to get slightly above average modifiers then roll the dice.  Dull.

In the end you have a game that is fine, but a little dull, for a single run through the campaign.  But nothing more.

The Pathfinder expansions are simply the continuation of the campaign.  As such they are all exactly alike, although with increasing difficulty.   

Each expansion contains the same mixture of cards: enemies, items, spells, etc.  However, each version is slightly better, or more powerful, then the previous version.  Each increasing expansion offers a higher modifier, or adds more dice or some other special ability.  

This just adds to the feeling of sameness and dullness the game already suffers from.

Again, there is nothing bad or wrong here.  It is just not exciting.

It is important to play the expansions in order and only use card from the current expansion to avoid throwing off the power curve.

I will list the campaign expansions in order, but I will not go into detail on each one as they are all the same.

Never liked the way that the deck was treated as everyone's life supply, but I like everything else about the game - especially the way the scenario/adventure path/etc. worked.

A friend of mine asked me if the game was worth buying. I ended up summarizing it as "It's a roleplaying game with all the roleplaying sucked out of it". The Skill Check mechanic (ie. add up your modifiers then roll dice to beat a number) are like those in RPG's, and the encounters feel random rather than planned out like an RPG adventure. I think that, with physical cards, you're much more limited in how much "fluff" text you can put on a card, and it's this flavor that *is* the importance of roleplaying. With roleplaying scenarios, authors have the luxury of using as many pages of text (and sometimes too much boxed text!) as they want to convey the flavorful atmosphere of RPG's. Also, despite the skill checks boiling down to rolling dice against a target number, the game has *MANY* counterintuitive or just plain odd rules that thematically don't make sense (but are necessary for game play). Finally, the later sets have improved rules and card stock -- skip to Sword and Shackle if you like pirates, and Wrath if you prefer generic fantasy.

*****

App's useful for the rules and, of course, more convenient for solo play. I really like the "card counting" the app does does. The app has a random quest version and difficulty levels that the physical game doesn't have (not that that would be hard for a fanmade variant).

The app only has Rise of the Runelords, so has *far* less content than the physical game. Plus, the app's not supported on all platforms. Don't jump in and buy stuff on the app without playing the game and seeing if it runs properly on your platform!

If the group isn't into it, it's incredibly boring. We played with six people and it really suffered, downtime wise. It just plain and simple wasn't very fun. Need to try it again with less players and a more focused game night, but so far I'm pretty disappointed.

EDIT: Did just that, played with three players and the game took off. This should not be played with more than four. It's an incredibly different experience with the right people. That tells me this game will see very limited play, but it was a great deal of fun with three. Adjusting score from 6.5 to 7.5

Well worth playing if you're into deck optimizing card games with a RPG feel (and customization/development as you continue playing). Tricky to solo, until you "get" the game and find the sweet spot of how many (and which) characters to bring. Bit of a grinding game, at times, but well balanced. How to manage the dice rolls and whether to play safe right now by using a card, or taking a risk and saving the resource for later, makes for interesting choices. Even though the scenario system itself can be a bit repetitive, the short flavour texts and varied main villains actually sets the mood quite well and provides varied challenges. Character progression is rather slow, don't expect to level away after every scenario played - but on the other hand, that keeps the game balanced and challenging.

In my opinion, this has everything the Lord of the Rings LCG has, but does it better. Pathfinder makes you WANT to grit your teeth, play honestly, and earn what you get. Every small advantage actually makes a difference, and as you reduce your deck down to its starting quota of cards after scenarios, you hone your character. At first, not being able to keep all the loot can be a little disappointing, but it keeps the design clean and reins in power creep. Finding a +1 sword is a big thing, and that's how it's supposed to be!

The rulebook seems a little complex at a first read-through, and is sorely lacking an index, but once you've played a scenario or two things quickly fall into place. Still, you have to check the FAQs from time to time, and there are many small but significant misprints on the cards themselves. It's a minor gripe for me, though, the game is logical enough that I could intuit the correct solution for rule problems I encountered.

Oh, and you'll be doing a lot of deck shuffling, so sleeves are strongly recommended. They also allow you to mark character improvements without damaging the actual card (or resorting to the downloadable sheets Paizo provide on their homepage).

We had 2 really great games for my first play.  1 4 player and 1 5 player.  Lots of back and forth and strategizing.  We won both but they were both very close and it was very satisfying.  Looking forward to campaign mode.

Loving the campaign mode, see my geeklist for the story so far, though I am way behind on blogging it:

RATING: 10
After playing two sessions (at the end of the second Lem slung a final, desperate spell and slew the dragon! Epic stuff!) I am very impressed with this game. 

The system of slowly evolving your character's stats and deck is simple but extremely effective and addictive. The designer of this game deserves all the accolades and glory for coming up with a way to have persistent characters and progression in a board game (ok, card game, but same thing). This is quite possibly the Holy Grail of adventure game design, and what springs from it We Shall See. Bravissimo!

I really am not keen on the LCG/expansion model for games, but I do think that anyone who buys into this will get themselves a great package and find good value for money. It seems to me that there is a hell of a lot of replayability in the base game - quite possibly in boardgaming terms infinite replayability - it's just that you are going to really want to take the adventure further and keep buying the adventure packs. If I was allowed to spend my money as I pleased (ie not married) then this wouldn't give me even a moments' pause (but then again if that was so I'd already have long since blown any cash on whatever was the hottest game/expansion series five years ago, and be up to my ears in debt, so I am not complaining, honest).

The game play itself may not be everybody's cup of tea, and that's understandable. Maybe the next game to come along which learns from this design will be able to come up with something more impressive in that area. But personally I have enjoyed the game play, and the simple but satisfying decisions and agonies over whether to play this or that card, and the little calculations about which combination of polyhedral dice gives the best chance at a positive result.

Please can somebody get the license to produce an Adventure Time version of this game, preferably standalone. I will buy that.

I received this along with the Character Add On Pack in the 2013 BGG Secret Santa exchange. All I have to say is "Wow!" I took it to a couple of game nights at the FLGS, and I had no idea that this would become my most played game for the next year. We've formed a pretty solid group around this game and have since jumped into the second one (which I think is even better). I absolutely love this game, and own all of the expansions for it along with most of the promos.

Fun playing solo and fun playing with 4.  Each game play leaves me wanting more.  It's not as complex as LOTR:LCG but it works with more people and it's simpler yet there still is customization.  So far it feels light hearted but very fun.
There are a several errors between starting equipment conflicts and card errors. I was aware of this so it didn't break gameplay for me but it's still unfortunate and one reason I'm not rating higher.

Doesn't work well as a solo game because it's a bit too fiddly, but it can work okay as a 2-4 player cooperative game. The game is too random, with some combinations of encounters and locations that don't make a great deal of sense. The idea of running a campaign with persistent characters for a cooperative game is compelling, and the main draw of the game.

This game is really fun at first. Chucking dice to fight monster cards and avoid traps. And then the next mission you chuck dice to fight monster cards and avoid traps. And then the next mission you chuck dice to fight monsters and avoid traps. And the next mission...okay you get the point. What starts as fun quickly becomes tedium. Flip over a card, throw dice, compare numbers, repeat, repeat, repeat. If you use all of your brain power you can at times force yourself to kind of imagine that you might be on some kind of adventure? But most of the time it's almost impossible to see any kind of theme in card flipping and number comparing.

This game fluctuates from being really enjoyable to infuriating, depending on the random cards you encounter (we were burned a few times when the Sorceress ran into cards she couldn't use her spells on). Having said that, if those cards don't come up, the game tends to be too easy, we were never really challenged, it was more of a case of simply hitting a card we couldn't deal with. It's a great idea for a game though, but perhaps needed more playtesting for balance.

An extremely innovative deckbuilder, thanks to the fact that you build your character (deck) from game to game. It's also a decently good cooperative game with a simple, reliable system, but it's really the deckbuilding that makes this game shine. Oh, and its evocative thanks to the colorful cards which constantly evolve as you buy additional sets of cards.

[1 play] D&D the card game. A quick, simple, character driven fantasy co-op that scratches the nostalgic itch for D&D in scenarios lasting about an hour each.

The scenarios can be chained together into an arc which has your character (if it survives) growing in abilities and possessions over time.

This is a great beer and pretzels romp for kids of all ages.

After a brief experience with RPGs during university I was looking for a similar experience in the board gaming world. PACG is the game that works exceptionally well in that regard. I have to admit the game does not tell a story in itself, it is, like its source material, a hack and slash experience where you go into a location hoping you will always stay on the holding end of various sharp objects.

There is no narrative in the game, but you can easily add the narrative yourself and the experience only gets better if you do so. If you're looking for a game that will tell you a story, similarly to Eldritch Horror, this is not your game. If you're looking for a game where every player gets to be a DM and describe the situation on the table during their turn, the number of different locations, scenarios, monsters, traps and loot to encounter will keep you entertained for weeks.

Jaj, de jó kis játék ez. Nekem végig játék közben a Mage Knighttal való hasonlóság járt a fejemben. Ez a játék abban különbözik, hogy itt nincs térkép, csak simán kártyajáték, de nagyon jó mechanizmusokkal. Mindenki egy hőst irányít, akivel különböző helyszíneken járva keresi a főgonoszt, akit nem csak legyőznie kell, hanem minden menekülési útját is el kell zárnia a végső sikerhez. Az egyes helyszíneken különböző dolgokba lehet futni, úgymint tárgyak, áldások, varázslatok (jó dolgok), illetve a főgonosz csatlósai, érdekes szörnyek és különböző akadályozó dolgok (rossz dolgok). Nagyon tetszik a karakterfejlődés. Van egy kezdeti paklink, ami az életünket is jelenti a küldetés során. Ha elfogy meghaltunk. Tehát óvatosan kell felhasználni a lapjainkat. A fejlődésnek két útja van. Az egyik a kaland megcsinálása, amivel különböző előnyök járhatnak. Lehet csak egy tárgykártya, de lehet a karakterlapunkon való fejlődés. A másik a küldetés közben talált kártyák megszerzése. Nagyon jó ötlet, hogy a küldetés végén a meghatározott számú kártyánk lehet adott fajtából. Ezért a küldetés során szerzett és alap kártyáinkból állítjuk össze a karakterünket a további feladatokra. Nagyon jól kidolgozottak a karakterek, tényleg eltérőek, különböző kártyák jók számukra. Jól kitalált az egyes tárgyak használati módja. Ha nem hozzáértő használja őket, akkor is lehetnek jók, de igazán tapasztalt kalandozó kezében működnek erősen. Nagyon tetszett ez a játék, lehet a szerepjátékos múltam miatt is, szerintem nagyon jól visszaadja az életútjátékot is. Minden játékosszámmal jó, egyedül is nagyon élvezetes lehet. Egyedül az újrajátszhatósága lehet problémás. Nagyon adja magát a kieg beszerzése és ezáltal nem túl pénztárcabarát társas.

Just got my subscription set and played our first game. Once we got the hang of it it went very easily and fast. 

Great game. We won the first scenario barely. My character was one card from death the last half dozen turns.

We liked the cooperative play, the feeling of different characters, the feel of different locations and monsters. Advancing characters gives it depth.

The ways to play, scenario, adventure or adventure path, give you a lot of ways to play from one quick game to a linked storyline.

Highly recommended!

Really enjoyed my first plays of this co-op card game.  My favourite part is the deck construction and how you record your deck between games so that you are always building on what you've done previously.  A novel mechanic that I've never seen outside of an RPG before.

Level-ups, fantastic theme, quick fights, good tense games that are easy to squeeze into cracks of time, small footprint - this game is great in every way!

lowering my ranking a bit from 9 to 8.  

i think i now like mage knight more solo.  the kids are into it, but it took several plays (level ups and good stuff).  

there is a bit of sameness to the scenarios; the theme starts to wear off to some degree as a result.

still, it's a lot of fun as an rpg-lite type of game.

This started as a very interesting game. I enjoy how it captures the essence of standard tabletop RPG encounters. The adventure path decks offer good variety, but at a certain point, the elegance gives way to some power creep issues. This game died for me as soon as it was revealed that the new base set would not work with this one.

These playtest cards were designed for single-sided, black-and-white printing. In the finished game, card borders will have colors instead of just shades of grey, and the charts that currently overlap the images on "Them Ogres Ain't Right" and "The Rusty Dragon" will move to the back of the card.

As a D&D 3.5 vet, and a board gamer, this game does a good job of straddling the line between the two worlds.  It's very, very light RP, and a long-term investment for a board game.  This will most likely NOT appeal to purists of either form.  That said, it's very popular in my group of 4.

RATING: 8
Gave this game another try, and enjoying it for what it is: a very light card-based RPG/dungeon-crawl.  There are enough interesting decisions playing as 4 characters to make it enjoyable.  I don't recommend playing this as a single character, too difficult and not that interesting.  Biggest draw is of course is the campaign and progression.

I really wish the game incorporated the source material a little more, key characters and events from the RPG adventure path are just glossed over, scenario cards give you too brief of an overview of the story. 

Scenario design got a little repetitive by the middle of the campaign of just "find the villain and kill him."  They start to mix it up a bit more near the end, and it sounds like future adventure paths with offer more variety.

It can be hard to get this game balanced in the beginning - you want random encounters, but there are monsters you literally can't fight with certain characters that require some "fixing" when playing solo. Once you get going, though, this is an enjoyable training for the other adventures.

While the rules are a bit shoddy, this is a pretty fun system that I enjoyed exploring for the first few adventure packs.

That said, the game has very little variability - You're largely just doing some rince-and-repeat which, combined with the high cost of buying the adventure packs every few games, was just too much & I gave up with the system.

I'd be interested to see how far its' evolved in the newer sets, but after playing Apocrypha my belief that the designers can make for a good & streamlined experience is...lacking.

We played through the three scenarios over Christmas Break.  They boys seem to really like it.  They like collecting new gear and advancing their characters.  We just earned our first skill feat and have to get some erasable pens or print off the character sheets to do that.  The first adventure is now set up in the box and I already have the location decks set up for the first scenario so it will be easy to set up when the opportunity arises.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to get my wife into the game.  It would have been nice to have another player (a 4th).

Received this in a math trade.  I've looked over the components but have yet to play it.

If I can get a new trade out of it for a game I'm more interested in - great!  If not - I'm sure that I'll try it out eventually and that it'll be a solid game.

Sold for cash - downsizing the collection a bit for a move.

I was in two minds about this game for quite a while.  I have decided I really quite like it.  Here's why.

While I wasn't present for it, I understand there was a lot of hype around this game when it came out.  I gather that it was marketed and pushed as something of a "D&D without a DM" and it's definitely not that.  I can imagine people who wanted that getting swept up in that hype and being disappointed afterward. 

The other criticism, and to my mind, the most legitimate one, is that this game is basically just rolling dice.  You draw a card, you roll a die.  You (might) discard a card, to draw a card and roll a die.  I can understand people getting tired of that.  When your go consists of drawing a (random) card and rolling a (random) number to see if the outcome was good or bad, yeah, I can see people getting tired of that. 

I have played probably less than ten times more than five, and a few times with the digital version and I am not at all tired of this game.  

For one thing, I like rolling dice.  Especially those lovely polyhedrals I fell in love with as a child.  It's not an insignificant part of fun when playing D&D, and there you usually only roll two; d20 and whatever your weapon's damage is. 

Secondly, the choices are narrow, but that doesn't mean they are not there.  Arguably 'draw a card, play a card' is the same metric of world-famous strategy games.  I think the choices are just more subtle.  Do you risk discarding your weapon to overcome this, in hopes you heal and get it back soon?  Should you explore the waterfront, and have a greater chance of getting something cool, but suffer minuses on your attacks, or the cathedral which is safer?  How do you divvy the locations up with your party? 

I'm not denying that the game is pretty simplistic. (Though sadly not simplistic enough that you could easily bring in people new to gaming or the genre).  It is pretty simplistic.  But so are a lot of games. 

I guess there's two main things that it's fantasy.  I am a fantasy geek at heart, and I will always love using a d8 mace to take a swing at a stone golem, or a skeleton, or the bandit mastermind.  I will always love casting cure, or fireball, and picking locks and escaping ambushes.  If you choose to see the story, and imagine what's happening (and sometimes you will need to stretch your imagination to do so!) then this game is a lot of fun.  

It's a strange new experience, when everyone at the table co-creates the bizarre situation that means you failed to pick up a sword you found on the ground.  But it is strange, and it is fun, with the right people. 

Lastly, people complain that it's capricious.. because it's the roll of a dice, some days you will breeze through, and somedays you'll just get hammered.  But I love that.  I miss games where you could actually just lose and die.  You know, what yes, you got ambused, and it went badly.  There was nothing you could do.  And sometimes the gods of luck smile on you and you crush the overlord villain mage in one fell swoop.  That's life.  That's luck.  And it's harsh but that's what makes it great. 

In closing, I can see why any or all of these things might make you not want this game, and that's fair enough. I get it.  But if you are a fantasy geek like me, and you like rolling dice, and you like playing in a capricious, cruel and unfair world then I really do recommend it.  I've had a lot of fun nights with this game and I hope you do too.

Currently playing solo using one character, Mersiel. Great game.  l'm becoming attached to my character. We've had some close calls. Knocking 1 point off for card erratta.

Update 6 months on - wow, still playing the same character solo and the fun factor is still there, in fact I'm enjoying this more now.  I'm currently tackling The Hook Mountain Massacre. This really is an Adventure and for me anyway, an accessible rpg experience.  Excellent stuff!

I legitimately love this game.  This is a cooperative deck-builder with reasonably accessible rules, a spatial element, and one of the most refined systems of mechanics I've seen in a game since Mage Knight Board Game.

In this game each player in the party selects a character class, this character has a set of stats and powers thematically relevant to the Pathfinder RPG and a deck of cards made up of some combination of basic items, weapons, spells, allies, and blessings.  There are also stacks of cards in the center of the table that represent locations, players explore these locations and encounter monsters and traps as well as treasures they can try to acquire for their personal decks.  There is also a BBEG hiding in one of these locations, the game is won by defeating this villain when he has no other location to run to.

This game gave me a decent helping of feeling like I'm playing the tabletop RPG (and I have in fact played quite a bit of Pathfinder as well as several others) in a fraction of the time and investment the actual tabletop RPG demands.  As I said, the system is incredibly elegant.  Your deck represents your life total and functionally and mechanically each of the cards makes sense.  Some, like weapons, are simply revealed for use and have no effect on your life total but others, like spells, are discarded (without a successful check) representing exhaustion of your character.

Perhaps you noticed I typed "without a successful check", in true tabletop RPG form conflicts in this game are 99% resolved with dice rolls based on your character's combat prowess and skill and ability set.  A character's stats are thematically balanced with their class along with their starting deck make-up.

Finally, the game can (and in my opinion, should) be played as a continuous campaign.  At the end of an adventure your character levels up gaining stat bonuses and powers as well as customizes their deck with the new loot they found in the previous adventure.  The adventures get progressively more difficult and intense but characters level up and become more skilled and better equipped to meet those challenges.

It's not ENTIRELY puppy-dogs and rainbows though, I have played this game with 6 players (with the character add-on pack) and that was a bit much.  It did extend the playing time a little, but not excruciatingly so, and there was down time but that can be remedied by really getting into the game and looking over your cards and seeing how you can help your team mates.  I feel like in my 6-player game a few of the players checked out when it wasn't their turn.  Even with dedicated players though 6 people brings with it the most number of locations and different characters with varied decks and especially for early plays the very varied abilities on all these cards can be overwhelming.  I constantly forgot about powers and abilities of cards including my own character card throughout that game while trying to take everything in.

I feel like 4, the max with just the base game, is probably the sweet spot for this game and there is a lot of content in just the base set which includes the first adventure module.  There are many more adventure modules in the pipeline so this game is going to have a lot of replay value.  One I'm certainly champing at the bit to play again and I don't expect to get tired with the amount of varied content and gameplay this offers.

Great but just short of Awesome, though I imagine its better with 3 or 4 players. Theres ALOT of dice rolling here but don't let that put you off. Seeing your character(s) grow over time can be quite satisfying.
The main drawback is the randomness of what you carry with you. Theres no 'shopping' as such so tuning your character can be a little hit and miss.

A good translation of traditional RPG mechanics into card game format, complete with character progression.  Can be played solo, and that's fun, but it really shines with more players in co-op mode.  I like the more 'traditional' setting of this game (compared to the pirate-themed Skull & Shackles setting), but since there's no 'Society' adventure path for this set it sees less play.

All the mechanics of an RPG with none of the fun. I'm surprised people like it. It's just very random and poorly paced. The only interesting part is the persistent characters but the deck-building is really uninteresting. After that, there are very few game play decisions to make. You go to a place and roll the dice that the cards tell you. Hopefully you have a card that you can play if you fail then you just roll the same dice again.

A fun game.  The game itself takes the role of "Dungeon Master" allowing all players to act cooperatively to defeat each scenario.  There are very useful online videos for this one which can help clarify the rules.  Some players may find the rule set a bit fussy and if you get impatient with finicky rules you might not find this title suitable.  My game group has enjoyed it even when we lose.

Really enjoyed this game initially, but after a dozen or so plays I realized that this is the definition of "wash, rinse, repeat". None of the scenarios offered ANY variety whatsoever.

I never went into this expecting an RPG experience. I did, however, expect it to be a light fun card game.

Initial impressions were high. Conceptually, I almost love it. Locations that are standardized enough to maintain continuity, but fluid enough to allow variety. Also, being able to take a character and improve it from session to session sounded really cool.

Repeated plays, however, revealed it to be somewhat samey and repetitive. Also, the design doesn't feel particularly tight. The game engine has some loose screws. Some rides might be smooth but others will definitely be bumpy and slippery. I've had games where I won easily because of a lucky shuffle. I've also had games that ended almost before they began. You guessed it -- unlucky shuffle.

The rules aren't the worst I've ever read, but they are far from airtight.

Best thing about this game is that it's so popular I was able to trade it for Tash-Kalar.

RATING: 5
Fun game with some interesting things going on. However, it starts to feel very samey after a while. The slow progression between games is supposed to emulate an RPG, but it is just way too slow for board game players who don't invest a lot of time into a game. Additionally, there is a lot less player interaction than I'd prefer. Being at the same location of an ally is almost always meaningless (save for some cards that have multiple checks, which are very rare). Ultimately, it is enjoyable, but lacks the cleverness or teamwork that I really want from a co-op game. Still something I'm willing to play, but the replayability seems to diminish faster and faster as it devolves into just seeing what you encounter, rolling some dice, and hoping that you can find the henchmen / villain in time.

Decent systems, but can we get more variety and maybe more decision making and teamwork?

EDIT: After reflecting on the game I feel it has dropped a lot. It was neat at first, but the game basically boils down to playing cards and rolling dice over and over. There isn't much progression save for some minor card tweaks and the whole thing moves so slowly. I would have much more preferred a game that is 1/5th the duration but with 5x more gain.

EDIT AGAIN: Game just doesn't hold up as much as I'd like. I feel that the moves are fairly obvious and so much of it comes down to luck instead of planning. Would rather just play other games that do what this does but better.

RATING: 6
Really mixed bag here. Gameplay is very simple. Draw a card, roll what it tells you to. There are a lot of cards, but most are just variants on the same thing; the game has some 16 odd stats, which differ only in when a card you draw tells you to roll them.
As a one-off game, this would be dull fast. The appealing part is the campaign and character advancement, and co-op play. When we got more into that, we're having a lot of fun with it.
Several rules are very, very confusing. No, they go past confusing. Many of the rules and much of the card text is just flat out wrong. This lowers my rating a bit.
The variety is very limited, and they designed it to lack replay value so they can churn out expansions. If you are willing to buy all the expansions, there's a lot of gameplay here.
Not sure how to rate it; probably closer to a 7 or 8 for the whole series, but we wouldn't play the base set much on its own.

The game is good, the idea is very nice - but the many errors in the rulebook and on the cards, drags my rating down with at least 0.5, and another 0.5 is lost because all the scenarios feels the same - turn a card, roll some dice, close the location, catch the bad guy, done - hooray! Or not.. But I am a sucker for fantasy, and cards - and there is a LOT of cards in here!

I was interested in this but having seen how the game is designed I can't see any reasons to play it.

The focus of the game is grinding. Grind through this scenario, get some loot, grind through the next scenario, get some loot, character dies, grind a new one to a competitive level, new expansion is out? grind through some more scenarios. 

Grinding sucks but it can be tolerated if there's good game mechanics to keep things interesting. Here its all flip a card, calculate probabilities if not obvious, roll some dice. Oooh dice! Rolling that 6 really convinced that villager to help us. So thematic.
 
And it's even more tolerable if there's a story and interaction to keep you interested. What's that, no story at all? Well how about NPC interaction? No none of that either. Well how about inter-player interaction? Nope. Well you can add a small bonus here or there but that's about all. Can't let that any of that nonsense get in the way of grinding for loot.

One of the reasons I don't play RPG videogames is that I don't have time for their nonsense. Why would I then play a slower, less interesting version of that. Yes it's more social but only because people are in the same room. In game there's zero. Also the difficulty of getting the same group of friends around regularly enough to make it through a season is nigh on impossible.

Tried the 1st scenario with different playgroup, both ended quite liking the game, while it feels kinda a bit too easy... maybe its just the intro scenario, im hoping its gonna give me a challange at later scenario.
I like it for the way it gives your character new feat and growth, the real sense of leveling up, a grinding dungeon crawling but simple and easy to teach. Maybe this is the dungeon crawler that I searched for... but I saw already like 5 expansions in a year, its just too much expansion and so little on the base game... overall a good simple game card rpg style game.

Edit: Yep, There's very little scenario contents on the base game, Why dont they (paizo) put 2nd scenario in the base game instead extra locations for add on 6 players game... only base scenario and 1st scenario make this game feels like we must buy expansion scenario a lot, so little value in the base game. not counted the character add-on... The base game only have like 10 hours play value (not counted replay for grinding), which is pathetic for a box that big.

I feel our game group already break the game... just too easy and not challanging anymore...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Mixes deckbuilding, adventuring skill-checks and role-playing character progression into one delicate mix of fun.

Highly enjoyable game, bit worried though about all the empty space in the box. The adventure packs I get, that is just character progression, tougher enemies and better gear. However, the base set (though it comes with over 500 cards) does leave a lot of empty room and I certainly hope that is not done for sleeving or other such folliness.

As there are lots of identical copies of cards, replayability with 'just base' might be thin. On the other hand, a full game of Pathfinder will cost you a rib. 

Should I be able to pick up a complete secondhand set from a game club for a decent price, I'd do so in a heartbeat. As I can see from this game, each expansion will not only simply expand it, but make it better by bringing even more variation in the deckbuilding possibilities.

Recommended.

For trade as I don't want to put large sums of money in this game, and pretty much seen what the base set has to offer.

Love it, since I bought it from a guy complete with all expansions, but I wouldn't recommend buying it without at least one or two expansions.

With several expansions, you can keep a character for MONTHs worth of game nights.

Roleplaying games are all about the stories they tell. This card game tries to simulate that and add in 'game mechanisms'. In the same way as Lords of Waterdeep before it, I feel as though it loses a lot of the appeal from storytelling and adds very little in the way of interesting mechanisms.

In our first play one of our players spent almost the entire game evading cards (read, putting them at the bottom of the pile of cards) and so really didn't do *anything* for the entire game. Yes, you're meant to play the same characters throughout a series of 'adventures' and so each character will have varying amounts to do in different types of mission, but as a single play, that's just poor design.

As for the game itself; flip a card. You are required to roll an 8 to beat this card. You get a D8. Would you like to another D8? If so, play this card (okay). Would you like to add a D4? (okay). Now your team mates ask if you need any more help - "Well," I say, " my outcome is anything from 3 to 20 and I have no control over it, so who knows?" With no post-roll modifiers, this is all just about managing probability and risk and not in a fun way at all. We played Can't Stop earlier in the day. It offered all of the same decision making in a third of the time and with 1% of the components.

Finally had a chance to play this one. My enthusiasm is a bit diminished. I had been hoping for a game to act as a shared experience with my wife. The kind of game where it felt like you were working as a team, and leveling up characters.

The latter, I think the game does quite well, in my opinion.  The 'working as a team', not so much.  Instead, your party spreads out over as many locations as you can manage to try to hunt down the villain.  That seems the antithesis of how most RPG parties actually work.

As a result the game has what I can only describe as a 'gamey' feel, like the mechanics take precedence over the theme.  And while I enjoyed the game, I'm not sure I'll bother picking this one up.

A great RPG and dungeon crawler that comes in the form of a card game. Many characters to choose from, and various paths to take.

RATING: 5
Play twice: Brigadoom solo (2 char), and first 3 scenarios with 3-players.

My issues are that one, there was no narrative juice to suck out. [Parse that NSA!] Two, given that character and toy advancement are fundamental to the experience, there is a profound disconnect between the consequences of dying (lose essentially everything you've gained over many many hours of play), vs voluntarily failing the mission to protect a character in danger. There is no downside to failing a mission other than the time you sunk into that one short encounter (though I think you can keep whatever you've already found in that failed mission).

I think the "deck is your life" is a cool idea. What I don't like about Pathfinder Card Game is that it has a "once through" mechanism, rather than cycling as in Decipher's Star Wars CCG,  or deck "refreshing" as in Middle Earth Quest. You draw through your deck and you die. Yes, there can be opportunities to heal (refresh: discards to draw pile), but in the early going, the upside seems incredibly meager vs the opportunity cost.

Worse than once through, your character is in threat of perma-death unless you have N cards in your draw pile, where N is your hand size. With starting decks of 15 cards and hand size of 6, you only have access to 9 cards before you're at risk of dying. You can safely draw 3 cards. Weeee.

There are some tricks you can pull to put cards in hand under your draw pile. At least some low level characters have a very limited means of searching their deck for a crucial card. Yes, each character gets a single, guaranteed starting card, but that's not always enough. The cleric doesn't start with a weapon, and without it you're kind of terrible. If your mace is buried, drawing cards to search for it is quickly suicidal. Frustrating and non-thematic.

"Oh hey guys, you know those villagers who are about to get slaughtered? Let's just let that happen. We can saunter back to the tavern, hope I can find my mace, and start this all over. I'm sure there will be some survivors that we can, um, save. Tomorrow."

We didn't actually face that problem, because we won fairly handily all 3 times. In that sense there was little tension. It felt like a puzzle, with a fairly substantial setup time, mitigated only by an all hands on deck approach to scenario construction. There is a potential danger of it being very rinse-and-repeat, but we didn't continue long enough to test that. 

With all that said, I feel like it's a huge near miss. It could have been awesome. Many people do think it's awesome. Maybe I'm missing something, and the idea is so tantalizing that I want to give it another shot.

This game deserves a 10 so far based on obsession levels, desire to play more, and fun but the volume of errors, card inconsistencies, and contradictory rules take it down a few notches. Still highly recommended after my first week of ownership.

Cute theme, and a good excuse to roll polyhedral dice. I like the idea of building a character as a deck to be drawn from, as opposed to as a flat stat sheet. Still, I'm not convinced that this is a game I would tolerate for actual campaign play. It also has the collection thing going, so buying in is a little daunting.

A co-op game I really like. Probably because there isn't always an "obvious leader driven" solution. Its not a deckbuilder in the sense of Thunderstone, Ascension or Legendary. Rather, your "deck" is your HP and its filled with skills, allies, weapons, and such. There is a nice balance between sort of "digging" for useful things and not dying :) - the deck builder comes from acquiring new cards  during a scenario and then sifting through the loot to rebuild your deck for the next adventure.

Also, each character really plays fairly differently in how you use them. having played 8 or 9 of the classes, each approach has to be different and can be tweaked a bit depending on how you like to use them (of course, the equipment you find makes a big difference too).

If there is any one downside to the game, it is that it is a MASSIVE card game and setting up and tearing it down is a pain in the ass. Yes, the insert is sweet, but still...

Overall, this is a card game that feels an awful lot like you are running through an adventure campaign.

**Update Jan 2017
Having played through the entire game - IN THE iOS APP, I have mixed feelings about the tabletop game. First, the above description is still true and this is a fun game, but the setup and teardown is a bit much. There is a good progression through the game's adventures/campaign, though the story is more of a "fill in the details with your own imagination" thing (the app does fill in those story gaps, but only a hair more). 

My biggest complaint though is Paizo and Obsidian (the app developer). Their purchase model is basically the same costs for the physical vs the app. I'm not really sure I want to do this again with the other sets (and man are there a lot of sets out there). The game was fun, but doesn't draw me out enough to pay for another set - not when I can play the app and avoid setup and teardown and having to keep track of everything.

A single learning game is hardly enough to rate this game, so consider mine a tentative score at best.

This co-op feels closer in spirit to Sentinels of the Multiverse than to, for example, Pandemic. The reason I say this is because the game is very much about working to overcome a series of individual bad guys (or obstacles that are mechanically equivalent to bad guys) as efficiently as possible as opposed to solving a single larger puzzle. If you are looking for a "roleplaying" experience in a board game, I think you'll be better served by one of the D&D co-ops or something more traditional like Descent. Pathfinder is fine for what it is, but doesn't satisfy any desire that I have.

What may up my rating is the campaign play, which I haven't had a chance to experience. In its long form, Pathfinder may reveal strategic choices that increase my enjoyment (and therefore my rating).

Amazing. Really does live up to the hype. Goes beyond a deck builder into a genuinely original fun game with proper campaign option being the only way to ply it to the max. Tremendously done so that every adventure is right down to the wire. Correct play will usually lead to reward whereas sloppy play will inevitably end in failure. Excellent.

My first game ranged from engaging to boring depending on my card draw. But it ended with excitement as our fighter needed the last card flip and last dice roll to win! Based on that, I would want to upgrade my character and continue the story/adventure.
The graphic design works but a few more touches could have brought the art from clip art layouts to an exciting looking game.

I'll say this, this game gives you material enough to spend a lot of time playing it wihtout repeating material... The system works well, and there's some fun to be had building and using your own deck... but ultimately, this is a weird Pathfinther simulator that excises the meaningful RP and personal interaction bits, and after a few runs, it starts to feel really pointless and boring, at least to me.

Translation is horribly bad. There are lots of cards with misleading or unclear translations, references to keywords that are nowhere to be found in the rules book and sometimes even contrary to what was intended. Additionally the game is astonishingly fiddly to set up with pulling out all the selected cards and building the rather non-thematic location decks. It's kinda weird in that way, because even though it has a rather bland mechanics and fiddly setup, when you get going, you want to get through and finish to distribute the loot. And play again, because you build up your character. But you really have to bring your own story, because the game itself doesn't give you much of that. In a way that's very close to old-style RPG play, where the story didn't come from pre-built modules, but from what the GM and the players could come up with. Box includes the character addon. The expansion boxes (both the addon and the included first expansion) are damaged, but all cards are fine and complete.

I find that after I play a game of Pathfinder ACG, I can't stop thinking about it for hours. That should be a testament to how much it can draw you in. My main gripe with the game is the rulebook; however, I haven't subtracted any points for this because the game's developer is very active on BGG and other forums and has answered pretty much any question/clarification I've come across.

I've been searching for a solo fantasy/RPG card game that is engaging after a few plays, and this is it. Although the scenarios are perhaps a little repetitive (find villain, corner, defeat) the PACG scenario guides you can download from the Paizo website make the narrative really strong and engaging, making you care about the characters and not just the dice rolls. But the gameplay itself is challenging - hard to win some of the scenarios - and rewarding with some good strategy/luck balance. Just a really great game, and thoroughly recommend if you're looking for a solo game.

RATING: 4
Move pawn to a location, draw a card that isn't connected to this location in any way, build your dice pool according to what the card asks of you which can be easily made big enough to asure 95% success on the important rolls, roll dice, repeat until you won the scenario or get a boreout.

This is nothing but a poor excuse of an adventure game. There is absolutely no ongoing story, the game doesn't create a plausible story by itself, it just throws random bullshit at you, which you should dodge. The only thing that motivates playing further is building up your deck from the slowly trickeling rivulet of useful new cards you find.

I like deck building games and I love Pathfinder. This game seemed like it would be a hit for me. It certainly was.

It's a good game for multiple sessions, going through a whole adventure path, or even just a single game, scenarios. Character progressions creates a bond with your character and the fear of losing your character makes you get really involved. 

Good both Solo and with multiple people. The sweet spot is probably 2-3. More than that is doable, but the game takes a lot longer because of it.

RATING: 5

I was curious about Pathfinder, and got a chance to play.  I only played a one-off scenario, and I suspect the true joy of the game is the campaign mode which lets you level up and acquire new cards and make persistent changes to your character.  That would be where the main appeal of this game would lie for me... being able to customize and choose a direction and flavor for my character.  My favorite part of any fantasy based game has always been setting up the character initially and leveling up and assigning skill points.

The artwork in the game is good, and I like the detail and minutiae on all the cards.  And I like the idea of the game. Unfortunately, the execution of the game just felt like random dice rolling. Our game followed the same basic format throughout the game.  Pick a location, explore as much as you can and hope you roll high dice.  There were occasionally strategic decisions where you had the ability to influence what type and how many dice you roll and whether you assisted other players with blessings, etc. but for the most part those were fairly obvious decisions.  Maybe it didn't help that I played with people who announced things like "You're expected value is an eleven."  So there were turns when things went against us and complaints were leveled against players who "rolled poorly".  And we had victories when players rolled well.  But other than the joy and dismay of the high and low dice rolls, there wasn't much else going on.

It wasn't an unpleasant way to spend 45 minutes... but it didn't really feel engaging either.  I feel like I could have stepped away at any point and asked someone else to roll the dice for me on my turn and there wouldn't have been any significant difference from how I would have played the game, regardless of how long it took me to get back.  On the other hand, it's a game my son would probably love.

RATING: 6
[thing=133038][/thing] is a light, cooperative game, set in the world of medieval fantasy (yes, basically D&D). The dynamics of the game is quite simple: each character has an especific amount of cards that must be in his deck. For instance, Harsk, the dwarf ranger, that prefers tea to beer, must have in his deck: 5 blessings, 5 weapons, 1 armor, 3 itens and 1 ally, making his 15 card deck - this number is the same for every character (at least in the base game), what changes is the amount of the type of cards, and also the type itself.

Once the deck of the heroes are ready, is necessary to prepare the decks of the locations: each scenario card indicates which locations will be used, and each location card has the info regarding how to build the deck for it: usually it takes 9 cards + 1 scenario card. The 9 cards come from different types: monsters, barriers, blessings, weapons, spells, allies, and so on. As you can see, some of these types matches the ones the players can have in their decks - and if the player finds these cards, they can take it (if he passes in a test), even if he doesn't have a use for it, as he can passes the card to his companions (during the scenario, or later, if they won the scenario).

After the locations decks are ready, players decide in which location his adventurer will explore. Then, in order, the player first reveal a blessing from the time deck (I call it time deck - it is the in game clock to mark how much time is left for the adventurers to complete the scenario). Then he explores, flipping the first card of the location deck and dealing with it (usually the card will require a test - sometimes to kill a monster, or to sneak by it; or to acquire an item; or to avoid/pass a barrier; and so on). It is possible to continue exploring, if the player can discard a blessing or an ally - but if he doesn't have neither one, or he doesn't want to, the turn passes to the next player. This goes for up to 30 turns, or sooner, if the adventurers win the scenario (or everyone dies).

Each character has the same attributes, but in different values (or different specializations) - Harsk rolls a d6 for Strength, a d8 for Dexterity (with +3 for Ranged), a d12 for Constitution, and so on. This makes them more apt to deal with some situations and locations - and it is up to the players to figure this out.

The game is basically this, the rest is just follow the instructions on the cards, and consider which cards to use and when to use them. After the scenario, the players can change the cards in the deck of the adventurer, but they can't change the amount of cards (so Harsk can take a better bow, but he can't have 6 weapons in his deck - one of the other weapons must go).

The game has some level of interaction between the players, more than in [thing=30549][/thing], but less than you get in [thing=42776][/thing], for instance. And the game might have more interaction than I give for it, mostly because the adventurers chosen in my group don't really do team-work - Harsk, the dwarf, is the most helpful to others! It is probably something in the tea.

Great game, good balanced, makes addicted.
Reason for no 9, it depends too much on luck sometimes, even if you roll all your possible dice, you can loss a fight, and lose your hand cards and so you die... and according to the rules, scrap your chara and restart it.

I just restart the scenario, with the same chara deck and so one... more fun. I just wanna not lose my chara cause of 4 rolled ones (happend to me) and hours of gaming are useless!

The basic idea that charachters develop from game to game is excellent (and something I've been thinking about quite a bit myself too). The rpg feel mostly comes from character development and skill checks with dice. There really is not that much theme to it and I think it all is fundamentally quite abstract. While the "piles of location decks" -system worked mechanically pretty well, I found it not giving me the immersive experience. Flip a card, resolve it b rolling a die, etc... There is still some distance left to the full rpg experience!

Also, mechanically the core card play mechanic could have been perhaps a bit better structured. Now it can be a bit confusing when and how you can play your cards.

All in all, I found this game OKish.

After completing the penultimate quest, I am a bit burnt out on this game and am forcing myself to finish the campaign. 

The randomness is it's downfall. I am also a bit to blame, as I am running it as a solo 6 character game, which is making the game much more fiddly than it should be. I will probably stick it back on the shelf for a few months until I get an urge to try it with some of the remaining 5 characters.

A RPG-esque game that I compared to Runebound and Descent. It leans a bit more towards the Runebound side without the game length. The cooperative nature is fun - I was tired of always being the Overlord in Descent. The character development is fun.

*** UPDATE ***
Have finished the first adventure deck. Noticing that once you have the big weapons and spells that advancing your character isn't all the rush it was when first playing. In that way it really does mimic an RPG well! We'll see how it holds up over time.

Bought into the hype here, sadly... I agree with much of what was said here: http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/blog/post/review-pathfinder-adventure-card-game/

It's a dull exercise in moving to a location, rolling some dice, then waiting five minutes to do the same thing all over again. It has no narrative and no interesting decisions. Furthermore the graphic design is incredibly bland and the card quality is mediocre.

Also, I resent that they couldn't give you ALL the characters for the MSRP of $60.

I don't understand how this monster of hype is still moving up the BGG charts. Ugh. I think people want it to be better than it is and rate based on wishful thinking.

I'm not sure what everyone is seeing in this game.  It felt like a game of Three Card Monte.  Not what I was hoping for.  Very little story development here.  This is not the RPG light game I that was lead to believe in reviews.  I like the idea of progressing your character from game to game, but the game play came off as dry.

It's an RPG in a box.  Gives you that old AD&D feeling without all the clunk, and its over in a couple hours instead of a couple months/years.  Persistent play between games, levelling up, gaining feats, it's all there.  Amazing game.  Comes with Adventure Deck 1.

Another reason why I like this as opposed to the LCG type games (LotR, Game of Thrones, Arkham Horror). You may have to buy other Base Sets to play more than 2 players. To play other scenarios, you seem to have to become familiar with a large chunk of cards to know how to build your deck. 

Here, your deck is small, the number of cards you gain is also small. You see small changes in your character as they get better items, better stats, larger decks(HPs). I don't have to ask my friends to buy a Basic Set if they want to play it. (We were playing MtG back in the v2/v3 days and are very much done with the CCG scheme).

----------------------------------------
My friends S&D also seem to like this game.  We barely won our first Adventure (on the last blessing card!).
------------------------------

I'm in love with this game.  I had eyed it off and on for a while and finally made the plunge. I am quite sucked into this thing.  I like the cards/dice combo of things.  Guess I'll see if it gets stale later on.  I picked up the character deck and the #2 adventure pack.

Ready to try this out on my friends to see if they geek out over it as much as I am.

A neat system, in a pretty crowded genre.  Deck building as a campaign is neat, and it's really quite cool how well they managed to make the typical RPG elements fit in here, between the different locations, different types of cards, and different classes.  Without a DM, you miss the storytelling aspect, but if you just like killing stuff for loot, this is a great fit.  It really does feel different depending who you are.  There's potential here to get a lot out of this if you're willing to run a long-term campaign.  You just might get really attached to a character.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The PACG seems to have found a rather unique niche. It's more of an RPG with cards than a deck building game. And it's more of an RPG game than board games like Wrath of Ashardalon or Runebound. 

I think the replayability and character building elements provide a strong foundation for this game. With the new adventure cards, there is a lot of fun mileage to get out of it. If you like RPGing and deck building, I think you're going to make a switch to this one.

Valeros and his bag of inifinite disposable longswords! Play with my RPG buddies and we create stories and situations as the cards come up.

Really enjoy that this lets you play a DnD/Pathfinder-style game with hard structure and no DM. It can be a little expensive to play through to the end given that you have to purchase the later scenarios, but I enjoyed the game from start to finish and with the variety of characters the game has decent replay value. Rules and card actions can sometimes be a bit ambiguous but for the most part it's pretty clear.

A+ to Paizo for continuing to support Pathfinder ACG on an ongoing basis by releasing new base sets as well as the character class decks that can be played with any of the base sets. These decks are fun (gnome summoner with demonic chicken cohort? amazing) and further add to game's replay-ability.

The game also functions well for solo play.

-Flip Card, roll a die. Repeat. 

-Lacks meaningful choices.

-The random nature of the cards demolishes the theme. "I found a tiger in the church! I found a sword, but failed to pick it up, so now it is gone forever!"

-The cards that don't improve your combat are near meaningless. What good is Charisma in this game?

-Every "adventure" is the same thing. Find the villain, kill him. 

Hands down the worst game I have ever played.

This is like an A++ for proof of concept for deck building campaign system, but sort of a fail as an interesting game. There is a fairly deep hand management aspect to the mechanics, but the actual adventuring is pretty random and mundane. It pretty quickly devolves into flip the top card and roll a die, then either pass or fail. Wash, rinse, repeat. It's pretty lame if you look to hard.

Still, the end of game wrap up where you divvy up the loot and build your deck for the next session is awesome. The idea of playing a character over multiple campaign games is awesome. Ditto to character perms-death. It really is a game changer. I hope this mechanic shows up again, tightened up, improved and married to other proven card and board game mechanics. Then they will be onto something.

A great deck building game with an RPG twist. The base game was okay but it is vastly better using some of the variety available and a set of coin and market cards I made for the game to help take out some of the random elements that frustrate the deck building/character advancement in the vanilla game.

In the end I think I love the concept of the game and the deck building more than the actual playing of the game.

Collecting new loot, recruiting allies, and hunting down villains are great. Playing a Rogue doesn't quite match the usual role one plays in an actual D&D game, though. Whereas in an actual pen and paper RPG, a Rogue could get an attack bonus simply for sneaking up on an enemy already occupied with another party member, here there is no possibility for such a bonus unless you're going it alone. Also, other than the ability to use some blessings on other characters, the Rogue has very little support to provide. With the random encounter setup, if another player stumbles across a trap or some other obstacle that is traditionally Rogue territory, you can't just step in and say, "hey, let me handle that" since it gets shuffled back into the deck.

But, despite the slight change in approach for a sneak-thief, this is a fantastic game. Having a tabletop RPG-like game without requiring someone to take on the extra workload of being a DM makes this a lot easier to jump into - and continue - than the traditional counterpart.

Good little game that scratches the itch of an RPG while playing a board game. Nowhere near as deep or as open-ended as a tabletop RPG and not particularly complex or compelling as a board game, but somehow satisfies my tabletop friends and plays quickly with no DM.

Very neat systems in play, but the pacing is a bit off.  There aren't many interesting choices, and some things seem thematically inaccurate -- for example, in a game about adventuring, killing monsters, and collecting loot, why is there no tangible reward for defeat a dangerous enemy?

There's also a bit more randomness than I care for.  It's not just the dice, but the fact that the players could luck out and locate the villain in the first few turns, or find that him and his henchmen are all buried at the bottom of each location deck.

IT's a really fun card game adventure that I would like to play and finish. It's a streamline version of the tabletop game but I say it's done really well and it allows everyone to play without needing a GM to guide the game. Every character has their unique strengths and weakness that will help with some card situations or events and others not so much. I also really enjoyed the dice rolling aspect of the game.

Would recommend this game.
The cons I'd say are that once you're done the entire campaign there's nothing to really do and the game is linear in that aspect but for what it is. It's done well.

RATING: 8
The Lord of the Rings Card Game is a great family coop game, but it's very thoughtful and mathy.  If you want something lighter and dice-based, Pathfinder is the way to go.

Still, I'd play either game anytime. Though LOTR may ultimately have more longevity due to the special rules and cards that change things drastically from scenario to scenario.

One pro in favor of Pathfinder is its campaign system.  I love the advancement method of swapping out old cards for new cards between adventures.

[i]Update:[/i]

The family loves this one. Rating increases a point.

Also, the temporary closure and villain vanquishing mechanics are extremely clever.  A really well-designed game, overall.

[i]Update #2:[/i]

I don't know what's beyond "love" on the game appreciation scale, but that's where my family has settled.  Pathfinder is their favorite game ever.

Not a lot of board games give you a feeling of Pen & Paper Role Playing Games like D&D--where you keep track of your character and advance them over time.  This game does it.

Easy? Yeah, it is.  I don't fault the game for it.

Some criticize it for being boring.  My advice is take a break from it.  Play something else.  When you get the itch to kill things and loot them, PACG will be waiting for you.

I have the base set of RoTR and 4 adventure packs, my group and I have so mcuh fun with this game that we want it all, all base boxes and adventure packs.

RATING: 6
While the game itself is rather easy, feels samey after several introductory scenarios, and is devoid of any storytelling (where is the story text/blurbs!?), it's addicting as hell since the chase for loot is ever present.

The OCD is me can't stop playing this game!  I generally quest with Merisiel, Kyra, Seoni, and Harsk using randomized wildcards to up the difficulty.

* RotR Adventure Deck #2: The Skinsaw Murders
* RotR Adventure Deck #3: The Hook Mountain Massacre
* RotR Adventure Deck #4: Fortress of the Stone Giants

* RotR Adventure Deck #6: Spires of Xin-Shalast

We also have all the promos for this game that were obtainable through our Paizo PACG subscription

Fun game, but seems a bit repetitive. The add-ons might give it more flavor.
Just the base game.

RATING: 10
Currently my favorite solo game due to theme, playtime, and fun factor. 

I've played through 3 scenarios solo and have really enjoyed it. I like the character building aspect and have comes across some very amusing and tense situations with my "spear wielding warrior." Very excited to try a 3 player campaign with friends. Perfect for solo play. Also very simple to learn and teach others. Scratches that "RPG" itch.

Unfortunately lacks story; was really hoping for a more thematic experience...but not a big deal. I've got a good imagination. 

I'll have a better opinion of the game when I play multiplayer. I do see a repetitive nature to the game...would've liked to have seen a few twists or game altering cards put into play.

Cards are decent quality; though the black borders are going to wear terribly and I dont sleeve =/

Excelente juego las primeras 10 partidas, luego se vuelve repetitivo, la mecanica de mejorar permanentemente a tus personajes (via renovando cartas debiles por mejores cartas y con los checks de skills) es una mecanica de lo mejor. A largo plazo se disfruta mas el armado de tu deck y el metajuego que el juego en si.

Arte impresionante, lo recomiendo si te gustan los juegos de aventuras lo pruebes al menos el primer arco de la caja base. Se juega bien solo y creo aun mejor de 2 en cooperativo.

Imprescindible que si se juega descargues los prologos y epilogos del bgg user:kittenhoarder (https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1199461/rise-runelords-prologues-and-epilogues)

A ver si Mike Selinker mejora el sistema de juego en su nuevo juego de 2017 Apocrypha

I love to play this game. After all the hype, it didn't disappoint me. Not a 10 because there's nothing perfect in life. I have only played one single character, though. Let's see if I can convince my wife to play it!

This game is likely to be a perfect 10 for me as soon as I start playing the adventure packs. I adore it, and have only played it solitaire so far.

The game has the finest form of deck building that I have ever come across. I love how you may add a few cards after each scenario, but must keep the same ratio of cards, unless you've earned a card feat. Great stuff!

I also enjoy the theme, even with the lack of fluff text beyond the adventure path, adventure, scenario, and location cards. This is a hit.

Alright I give it an 8 at the moment because I finally get my boyfriend to play a boardgame with me. I don't know yet if my rating will go up or down. Both could be possible, because I'll need to play the first Adventure set now. We only played the beginners scenarios.

I like cards, I like dices, I like fantasy theme, I love dungeon crawls, I like deckbuilders, I love exploration, I love co-op.

I hate the millions of skill names which doesn't make any sense at all (fortitude, diplomacy... really?), I hate monsters with zero flavor or meaningful abilities, I don't feel like I´m fightning at all, actually I feel zero pressure in this game aside from not being able to play my cards, I hate non-thematic closing locations (?), I hate getting marginally better cards than the ones I have in my hand already, I hate being forced to keep my plays in hand, I hate that I have to pay for playing my cards, I hate that being the mage I only have three spell cards in the deck and they´re not even good, I hate that I finally get to upgrade and all there is to do really is to +1 a card because no other choice is even remotely as good as that, I hate that we never have cards allowing me to interact with my fellow heroes despite the rulesbook says everywhere how we can help each other, I hate the blessing deck which has exactly zero point other than being a timer (and the blessings of the gods often do the same thing as the blessing card anyway), I hate long setup time, I hate the fact the game is summed up to a turn up card roll dice if you fail nothing happens kind of game, it's brainless and not very fun.

RATING: 5.5
I need to experience more of what it offers, before settling into a solid opinion on this game.

What I've seen thus far sets it leagues ahead of Mage Knight, in terms of enjoyment and nuts and bolts design - that said, I pretty much agree with all of Rich Moore's comments:

1. This is what people who don't play RPGs, think a RPG should be (all dice throwing and skill checking).
2. There's no narrative.
3. There's barely any decisions to make.
4. It's a rinse-and-repeat game, over and over again.

Played this for the first time on 4/16/2014. It was a blast which we all loved. We played three of us and we all had a fantastic time. My wife liked it also very much though she isn't a roleplayer. This is a big plus in my book. Though some perhaps say that the frequent use of dice makes this a luck based game, I cannot agree with this. Making your cards work together and tweaking your deck is what mitigates luck for a very BIG part.

It sure is going to see a lot of plays at our house!

Upped this to a "9" now, what a fantastic game!

\begin{High_pitched_voice} AWESOME!!! \end{High_pitched_voice}

This is definitely one of the best game I played in a long time! 
It's not perfect (see below), but it gives me the same feeling of an RPG with the advantage that I can play it with my wife when I have a spare hour.
Unfortunately, the production issues between first and second printing are a little bit annoying (especially since I have to buy the game online and I have no control on the printing version of the item I'm buying). Nevertheless, if you are willing to close one eye on the production issues and on the never-ending FAQ/Errata, the game plays very well and is extremely engaging. This is one of those games that, as soon as you are done with a scenario, you want to immediately play the following one!

Great game I feel in love with it, good and simple mechanics, tactical play, and campaign mode like it very much. A 5 player game has a little too much downtime, but it's a great 3 player game (maybe 4? Haven't played with 4 players yet).

Picked up this game, and was enamored by the concept and potential for cool *game*y fun (I actually do enjoy even a good game of abstract solitaire, so even mechanical theme-less games draw me sometimes).  
But all this game is is a disappointment.  After only 4 or 5 rounds, it became perfectly clear that all I was doing was flipping a card, rolling a dice to see if I could get higher than the number on the card, then either taking are discarding said card accordingly - rinse, repeat.  There wasn't even lather!  
Maybe if I had preciously played the Pathfinder RPG and Runelords story line, this *might* have served as a pleasant reminder of it.  But even the, all you do is roll a dice to beat one random number and move on.  There is pretty much no decision making here.  It's a-kin to blackjack.  either "hit-me" or "stand".  
And it's a shame, because the idea of expanding your characters repitware of cards over multiple playthroughs seems like it could have been fun.  But, unless i'm really not playing the game right, nothing that happens on ANY of the cards amounts to more than a *skill check* dice role with no interesting card interactions, player interactions, tactics, strategy.  And NO story.  Sure, you can read each adventure card to GET a story.  But, why not just read those and skip the game?  it would go from being "1% story and no game, just luck", to "100% story with no game and no frustrating luck".  
This *game* wouldn't even make a passable choose-your-own-adventure.

I'ld recommend to buy this game on steam during sales. It's a lot cheaper than getting the paper version. The game is addictive in that you'll always be looking forward to upgrading your deck with new cards. 
Basically there's not much depth to the game. It's about risk and card management. There's also a luck factor in rolls and finding the bosses in the decks before the timer runs out. The character progression is nice and the characters feel different enough, though there're a lot of secondary stats you'll not use often. I like the pc version because you don't have to go through the rules and there's no setting up the whole thing, so you can easily play for a half hour per evening for some quick relaxing adventuring fun.

Very confused by this game. It manages to emulate the skinner box addiction of numerous electronic RPGs and is as equally devoid of narrative as those same leveling-focused games tend to be... yet it's amazingly enjoyable. I guess at the end of the day if it's fun, maybe it's best to just not ask so many questions.

Edit: 12/23/14
The barren nothingness of this game is now readily apparent after getting back into true blue pen and paper roleplaying games. Just not worth my time.

While the rulebook could definitely use some improvements, this game is a hit!  I particularly enjoy the character progression, as long-term character investment is one of my favourite aspects of RPGs. 

The mechanisms of this game are quite fun.  Sure, they're on the lighter side, but they still work well overall.  I'm looking forward to future adventures, while equally excited about repeatedly replaying what's already available.

A co-op deck builder of sorts, with persistant characters. Tries to portray a linked story but it's never felt that way to me, with each scenario feeling fairly samey to be honest.

What it does, it does well enough though, but I'm not sure it's the sort of game you'd play over and over.

I like how, with 3 or 4 players, pipes AND card backgrounds must be considered.  Overall, though, an average tile-laying entry; won't suggest, but will play it.

It's clever all right, and more or less the only decent Cheapass game I have for two players, which makes it invaluable.

RATING: 6
Lay down cards to try to connect pipes.  You get to remove any sets you complete.  Seemed solid, but I'll have to play it a few more times to see if it remains fun.

RATING: 6
A great tile-laying game disguised as a card game. Probably Cheapass's best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It is indeed very clever.  This and Agora and Light Speed are my Hip Pocket game trilogy.  I do wish Cheapass could republish this as a "real" card game, rather than just card stock.

RATING: 5
Light connection tile game.  Plays very quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Delightful, light puzzle game.  Going first is entirely too advantageous though.  Therefore, rather than flipping a coin the players should knife-fight to see who goes first.  Loser mops up.

It is clever and it is a pipe game... just connecting your pipes.  It's okay, but I just can't see playing this game much with all of the better ones out there.

Tedious. One of Cheapass' better offerings, but this says very little. If you're going to play somthing difficult and abstract, play GIPF. Or El Cabellero. This just seems to be hard for the sake of being hard, without any underlying strength of game. Not nearly as bad as their other offerings, but certainly not recommended.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game has a lot more depth than you might imagine at first glance. This is also a case where cheap components do not detract at all from the game.  The pipes look quite clear in the photos.  

This is GREAT filler for 2-players, but I wouldn't mess with the 4 player format.  Quick, fun gameplay. Geez, for a couple bucks you really ought to pick it up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played this on the same night as Nexus to which it is fairly similar. Neither game stood out as great but it is fine for what it is, a quick filler. I usually prefer games with more length and depth so 6 is a good rating for a filler game. Also since both games are cheapass games I think the quality may have some effect on my ratings. I try not to let this happen but for some reason I'm sure it does almost like a hunch.

RATING: 7
Simple and quick. This is indeed a great game to carry around in your pocket.

RATING: 6
Play to create a network of either pipes or background of your color.  For pipes, close the network in order to score it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a lot of fun for such a simple, short, and inexpensive game.  If it were more complicated, took longer to play, or cost more than 3 bucks, I would have to drop my score.  The reason I didn&#039;t give it an 8 or even a 9 is because the cards stick together and are difficult to shuffle.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I&#039;ve played it a couple of times.  Fun and Quick.  You have to get inventive so that you can close your pipe set.  The advanced rules make it even more interesting.  Their are three versions of this game, a basic and two advanced.  I have only played the basic and the first advanced.

Yes, it's quite clever... and cheap. Connecting pipes and making fields is quite fun. Plays fine with two player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Production: I'd really like to see this as a true tile game, with embossed pipes.  The cards are clear and attractive, but difficult to pick up and they slide around quite a bit.

Play: Fun connection game.  Capturing cards, which then springs leaks, adds interesting play for both the active player and for the player who must respond.  I've never played by the true rules which allow cards to be played anywhere on the playing surface, even unconnected to existing cards, as I can't visualize the imaginary grid well enough for that to be an enjoyable facet. (2+0+2) (24 plays)

RATING: 5
Hey, it's a pipe game. This one is a little more clever than most, but it's still a pipe game. They're all the same really. This one's a little more clever than most, though not as clever as a non-pipe game. If you like pipe games, this one has 3 clever ways to play. However, in an unnusual move for Cheapass Games, there are no clever zombies or clever brains. Oh well, maybe the expansion will have Pipe Zombies.

RATING: 6
I&#039;m a big fan of &quot;Pipe Dream&quot;, the pipe-laying single player video game.  The Very Clever Pipe Game is similar in concept but somehow the multiplayer mechanic makes it very frustrating, as you have very little control over your own destiny.  Since you don&#039;t know what your opponent has, planning ahead is difficult.

[b][thread=482139]The PLAYMOBIL® Legion reviews "The Very Clever Pipe Game"[/thread][/b]

(As of [b]4+[/b] plays) A conveniently pocket-sized abstract strategy game. The tile-placement and set-collection rules couldn't be simpler, while gameplay can be surprisingly cutthroat. The most portable game in my collection (apart from [GAMEID=2593], which doesn't really count) it is perfect to bring along with you anytime you think there might be an infinitesimal chance to game. 

[b]2 year verdict:[/b] This is a game I will happily throw into my bag in case an emergency gaming opportunity presents itself.

A trade from ixnay66 for geekgold! *** Played in a pub and got some attention. It's quite tricky but the game descends into blocking your opponent more than helping yourself. However, I feel there may be more depth here, since we didn't really exploit the pillars. If you make an inner square space, that's a pillar and counts as a capping end. It is a clever pipe game, but maybe not very clever.

A Cheapass game for those who don't particularly like Cheapass games.  Be warned: it's an abstract game that's missing the typical Cheapass humor and thematic sillyness.  However, it features tighter gameplay and richer strategic considerations than most of the rest of their catalogue.  Not a great game, but a decent one that is only recommended for cheapasses or those who need a highly portable game.

Bought because I saw it for $4 at a FLGS where I had a $3 gift certificate. Gets played because it can be taken anywhere ('hip-pocket' series game) and doesn't require much table space. I even played it on the drop down tray on a plane!

However, not really a game I will ever pull out when I have my full arsenal of games available.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It just doesn't seem like this game should be as good as it is.  From very simple instructions (must match pipe colors) a tricky and anjoyable 2-player game emerges.  The game plays quickly, and I've never sat down and just played once.  I haven't tried the 3 or 4 player varient, but I don't think it will work as well as the standard 2-player version.  When you factor in that cheapass.com sells it for $4 you really can't go wrong.

First played June 28th, 2007.  Quick learn (<5min) and quick play (<15min).  This has a good balance of luck and strategy, perhaps dipping to the strategy (which is good for this game).  And the price is pretty good for this as well making this a good game to own and play.  It has three levels in it too so you can probably play it many times and not get board with it.  I found myself wanting to play again as it does have some good abstract strategy going for it.  I'd recommend giving this a game play and consideration to play every now and then.

RATING: 7
The most basic rules for two players where you are closing groups of pipes is the best way to play.  Its quite enjoyable and makes a nice filler.  For the cost components are quite decent though I would like to see the tiles be of higher quality as they begin to show wear quickly.  But then it does only cost 4$.  The aditional advancing rules seem to just not be as fun as the rest of the game and makes it unenjoyable and rather unpredictable for larger groups.  It also would vastly benefit for a grid so that when pieces are removed or added you can tell how far away they are from the rest of the board.

So good for so little money... why can't I find it?  Santa knows where to find it.....

Thanks "Santa"!  We've played a few games of this, but it's now on the shelf in favor of Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper.  However, it's so small that it would be easy to pocket and bring on a trip to help pass time.

Plays 2-4. One of CAG's first and best abstracts. Players (black and white) compete to complete pipe sections and remove the cards that comprise completed pipes. The entire deck is used. The player at the end of the game with the most cards wins. There are also light and gray fields ( the area around the pipes) Players can play the very clever field game too.

Very clever! And most of my 7s are games that I find just slightly more clever than playable. The Hip Pocket edition is simpler, and preferable. This is not intimidating, but still has depth, so it&#039;s easier for me to convince someone to play this than say, Zertz. Wouldn&#039;t play with 4.

OWN May/05: purchased; unplayed.

Hmm.  This appears to be a 2-player game, really.  4 is an afterthought, and 3 is really unfathomable -- and that's just from reading the rules!  DANG!  I didn't really want a 2-player-only game out of this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Simple and almost rewarding little game. I played a three-player game and the "goal-changing" mechanism was just...stupid like that... Don't like the idea though, no matter the number of players.

Because of the short lenght, I might be willing to play again but only with two players.

The best of Cheapass' hip-pocket game-series. A great [b]cardgame[/b]/[b]tile placement[/b] game where you try to close your own pipelinesystems and earning points for their size. I think the best part of the game is taking the cards off the playing area when you score them, possibly opening up your opponents pipelines that he/she was just about to finish. 10-15 minutes of great fun.

RATING: 6
Works fine as a two player game.  Is basically an advanced form of dominos.  Seems to favour short-term opportunism, which in turn makes luck more significant.  However easy and fun.  The "fields" version is a graphic disaster (in the 120 card edition at least) as the shadow effect on the white fields looks just as dark as the "dark" fields.   A pity, as this reduces it to being a two-player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cheapass Games's best imho. It's a tile laying game without a board. played too many games to count with the SO. Wonder about the balance of card distribution. Maybe JE needs to do a redux of this somehow (maybe diff color pipes with common fittings)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Excellent tile laying game! This is the best cheapass I have played. It's a real departure from the simple, dicey, entertaining games that they are typically known for.
It's has a fast, highly-simplified Carcassone feel to it, and German game fans should really like this one.
I suggest playing with a house rule that every tile played MUST touch an existing tile. (in the rules you can play it anywhere on an "imaginary grid" that can eventually reach the group, but that can cause players to play their opponent-friendly tiles way off from the rest of the tiles.) Apart from that, the game is good as-is. I really enjoy it.
Excellent glove compartment game. (worth the 4 bucks!)

very clever pipe game. reminds me of pipe mania on the comidor plus 4 which was a great game. has a lot of depth to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The game consists of a set of cards. The cards have white and black pipes in various six-outlet configurations, and players take turns placing them onto the table. When a player constructs a completely closed-off section of pipe in their color, he takes all the cards from that section. After all cards have been played, the player with the most scored cards wins. Additionally, the cards also have two different floors (which appear underneath the pipes) that can be used to expand the game to a four-player affair. The game was re-released in 2002 with a reduced deck (48 cards instead of 120) as part of the Hip Pocket Games series. Cheapass Games. CAG 960.

This is a great little game. It's easy to take along w/ you. We played it at the library today while we were killing time. It's pretty quick but takes a bit of strategy especially when you play pipe *and* floor color. It's best played as a 2 player game either with or without the floor color. I like to carry Chrononauts, Fluxx or The Very Clever Pipe Game with me so I always have something to do w/ my kids when we're out.

RATING: 6
Fury of Dracula's older brother, a simple but good gateway game. Cooperation, bluffing and deduction boiled down to a clever system, easy to understand and fun to play, all in a short amount of time. Balance-wise, it's a bit sensible to the number of detectives: with less than 5 people (counting Mr. X), you might want to consider assigning more than one detective per player. I must admit that I might not have managed in keeping nostalgia out of my evaluation, but I sincerely think that for being a 25 years old design it still works pretty well.

I still have the Ravensburger version I was given when I was a kid and I'm glad I didn't sell it. Simple but functional components, the only shortcoming being the fact that sooner or later you'll have to cut some paper to fit the strange size of Mr. X's... err... planning-my-route-without-telling-anyone thingy.

Deduction game about catching the elusive Mr X before the clock runs out.  Due to the slow movement and Mr X's special abilities, I thought it would be ridiculously slanted towards Mister X, but it appeared to be somewhat balanced.  the pace is slower than I care for though.

RATING: 8
One player plays Mister X, who try to evade the police and all other players are Policemen trying to play as a team so they can deduct Mister X position... A very interesting and cerebral game...

-1 Because of rule: it's dumb that policemens need to use and can found themselves without transport tickets!...
-1 Because it's not for everyone. It can be very difficult to play Mister X. As it can be difficult for the policemens to works efficiently together...

It's a fun game that play 1 vs 5.  The group of 5 detectives that are co-operating to catch Mr. X (the lone player).  It is a game of Cat and Mouse.  Recommend playing with a full team of detectives, much harder for the detectives otherwise in my opinion.

A primeira visão de um jogo "diferente" que tive na infância. O fato de não ter dados, de ser assimétrico, de ter uma dedução mais profunda do que o Detetive.

RATING: 8
Circa 1986: This game was a popular one for my brother, my friends and I, all under the age of 10. Even at that age, I suspected that this was a superior game to the likes of Game of Life, or Go For Broke,  our mass-market drivel-alternatives.

Circa 1990-1996: Teenage years had left Scotland Yard a little neglected, eschewed in favour of its sexier war-mongering brothers, Dungeon Quest, Mighty Empires, Blood Bowl, the Games Workshop in-crowd. But Scotland Yard would still apprehensively creep out at quieter moments for a guilty indulgence of childhood nostalgia. 

Circa 1996-2000: An occasional game with University pals. It never caught on. For 12 years, it didn't see the light of day.

2012: First thing of note when rediscovering Scotland Yard was that the box was full of labrador hairs belonging to a dog which had died some 16 years previous. Nostalgia, sadness, repulsion, mild gagging; a strange concoction of emotions and an uncommon physical reaction to a board game. The hairs were disposed of and that components bagged. Scotland Yard had come of age and was joining its new family of Agricola, Mr Jack (whom looked a little like a younger version of SY), Kingdom Builder, Dixit and many others. No longer would Scotland Yard spend its days wedged beneath Big Traks, Castle Greyskulls, and Action Men. The first plays were familiar and reassuring.

After my shelf filled up with games I purged a few.  This one didn't make the cut, but I was on the fence about whether or not to keep it.  I think I'd just always want to play Mr Jack over this and they're similar enough that I hopefully won't miss it.

I liked this very much on first play, when I was Mr. X.  However, my wife did not like being a detective at all, and complained that it was very hard to find me.  She enjoyed being Mr X more on out next play.  I prefer to be Mr X but it's OK being the detective.  

I hope this gets more plays because I think it has a lot of potential in our family.  My oldest son liked it and I think we need to give it more time.

It reminded me of a more elegant, stripped down version of what Fury of Dracula became.  I think I'll end up preferring it to that, but time will tell.  It's certainly a better length - shorter!

Original 1985 edition. Easy to play and enjoyable light cooperative game based on detectives in London attempting to capture a suspect (Mr X).  Difficulty increases (when playing the detectives) as your options get more limited (fewer travel tickets left) as the game goes on. Mr X has more flexibility (as gets the discarded travel tickets and has limited double move and concealed move tickets), but if adults are playing it's difficult not to get caught.

This is still one of my personal favorite games. The rest of my family doesn't like it though, oh well. What I like is the original idea of chasing Mister X who moves undercover mostly. All against one, a lot of fun for the hunting pack as it is for Mister X. And it requires lots of interaction and coordination of the detectives, there is no space for individual actions. 
But you need the rules. Don't chase an experienced Mister X with only 3 detectives. There is no reason why one person can't play 2 detectives, the game isn't that complex.

RATING: 5
+ Interesting hidden-movement mechanic; Very tense game of hide-and-seek.
- Any additional players as the investigators past the initial one really don't add anything to the game; Shares a main mechanic with Nuns on the Run (which I consider to be a more "fun" game).


Why it's previously-owned:
Because it's so similar to a favorite game, this one just didn't get played.
I gave the game away, hoping that it'll get played by my friend (with 3 young kids).

It was my first encounter with a hidden element in a boardgame, and it seemed so innovative to me that I had to have my own copy (though I've only ever played my friends' copy, even after getting my own).  We've always played 2-players, with one player controlling all five detectives.

1st play: I had heard about this before.  I wasn't really a fan of letters from Whitechapel, so I hadn't been in a big hurry to try out a similarly themed game.  We actually played the Swiss version, but the core mechanic is the same.  I liked it enough as a 30 minute game that played 6 and gave a sense of tension on both sides.  It seems to be sortof hard to find, but if I can scoop up a copy cheap I probably will - it's good pure hidden movement.

No second play.

This was my favorite childhood game, but I never got it as a gift because my parent's friend's kids had it (to avoid duplicate games among friends?).

Cooperative deduction/chase game. Can drag a bit when you are a detective but it's a tense game when your the thief and it takes a good plan to do well in that roll. Luckily the game isn't too long.

Need to play this one again sometime, to form a more recent opinion. As I recall, it was fun enough for a pastime, although if you're a seasoned board gamer, there's not quite as much there for you. Also, it's probably better with more than three players.

Having since acquired Fury of Dracula, I mostly feel that my itch for hidden movement and deduction is scratched now, and I'd probably only pull out Scotland Yard for people intimidated by that game. Anyone who can play Monopoly likely won't be reticent to give Scotland Yard a try; it just has that classic feel.

One of the best "co-operative" game I've ever played! After playing it several times, you realize that it's really an abstract strategy game that is dripping with theme. Roll playing seems to develop as the detective players start speaking with pathetic pseudo cockney accents, and Mr. X starts to laugh demonically. Due to the time limit on the game, it becomes fairly tense fairly quickly, especially for the dastardly fugitive. I love it!

Still, I really enjoy this one.

When my wife and I were dating she found this in storage.  She knew I liked board games and asked if I wanted it. I'd never heard of it but I took it.  Never really felt like playing it until my wife saw Fury of Dracula at the FLGS and thought it looked interesting. So we played this to try out the hidden movement genre before dropping money on a new game. Overall it felt a bit simplistic and the theme was a little bland, however the core game play was engaging.  End result was that it convinced us that Fury of Dracula with it's complexity and interesting theme seemed like a good buy.

I have the recent Ravensburger English Edition 2014. After being advised to go back to using the game's original rule set, particularly -

*Drop the 'police' and use all 5 detectives with their tickets.

This turned an average game into a good game.

This game is apparently well known to many from their youth, but despite playing all kinds of games as a young kid I never saw this one until the hobby explosion hit in the 90s.  Having come to the game later, I don't have the bias of memories.  So does the game warrant its fame?  Perhaps...  Its a solid enough design, but it is not particularly deep.  It's much less sophisticated and plays longer than the most recent designs aimed at the same audience would offer.  Due to these factors, the game has a feel of game + activity, which is balances fairly evenly.  Thus if you are looking for an experience that fills time and happens to be a respectable game - this works well.

Have owned this for years, well before I could even grasp the concept of SDJ.  Interesting game, but I find that it is really to the advantage of Mr. X in almost all cases and unless you are playing with the most meticulous and precise of players for Mr. X, they will screw something up and destroy 45 mintues of game play without even realizing it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of player is Mr. X.  Using taxis, buses or subways he must evade the detectives, but reveals his location intermittently throughout the game.  Young Tom in our game tried admirably, but was at a disadvantage as all the detectives drew start places close to his.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Picked this up on ebay to add to my SDJ winners collection.
Have only played this as a two player game (me taking the role of 4 detectives and my wife being Mrs X). The games didn't last long as my wife must be the worst criminal in history (no offence darling). She was caught within 4 turns each game. However I can see that this is a good game that might just fit the bill, excuse the pun, when my group fancies a change from the usual take control, collect, trade etc games we play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
Great deduction game. Seems pretty well balanced as far as the sides go, and if it isn't it's easy to modify/handicap. Give Mr. X fewer/more special moves, or give the investigators fewer turns/tokens. If I had to give the advantage to one side I'd say Mr. X but I really can't make that judgment after so few plays. 

I've only played one similar game, Letters From Whitechapel. I really like both, and it's hard to compare them. I liked that in LfC you get to find a trail and that makes the pursuit more exciting. But Scotland Yard is more straightforward and feels a bit more like you're constantly closing in, rather than LfC's nightly resets.

I pretty much only play this 2 player, and it makes it a 'me against you'. If you succeed in whatever role you take, you feel like you out-thought your opponent. More than 2, it can bog the game down or have one person basically playing for the team.  (It CAN play well with more, but there is risk involved.) A fun asymmetrical hide-and-seek.

Entry-level game. I recommend playing this as a 2-player game.  I also suggest writing down the Detectives' moves.  It is sort of interesting to recreate where Mr. X was each turn in relation to the Detectives.  The near misses, once revealed, can add more fun for the Detective Players.

I like it...the people I play with haven't been quite as impressed though. The perfect grove/balance of the game is still to be discovered. The first two times we played, Mr. X was found almost instantly by the detectives. The third time I was Mr. X and evaded capture so affectively and cruelly that the detectives decided that it was impossible (it was a different, new group of detectives this third time).
I know the balance is there and that this game has potential. I'm going to print off the strategy page from the geek and try again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After multiple playings, the game seems more balanced than originally believed.  All depends on how sneaky Mr. X is, from what I can tell.  A person who "safely" plays Mr. X seems more likely to get caught than a risk-taker.

2017 - (4) - Someone pointed out to me once that this effectively a two player game (Mr X and the 'alpha detective', with any additional players mostly following the alpha's lead), and I am forced to have to concede the point.  So while flavorful and fun, its just not the deductive game I'll try to bring to the table - neither for 2 nor for more.

2009 - (8) - Played a few times now, once as Mr. X and the rest not.  This game is great!  Nerve wracking as Mr. X and a good mix of deduction/consensus building as the detectives.  Further proof that I am *in* for deductive games.  I suspect if this got played more often it would be less interesting - and a good set of detectives should probably never lose.  Recently brought out and played with my 7 year-old daughter and 10 year-old son and I was surprised at how well it actually went.

Pros
This game has gone down well
Mechanics are simple enough to get quickly
Has been asked for by friends

Cons
Can feel a bit like two player with one player directing others a common complaint with coop games. It's not that I'm bossy but I am know as the 'gamer' so decisions are often differed to me and I often take an active rather than passive interest in how the game is going
Also drags a little when the detectives start running out of transport options

This game is great! It's about how well you know (or THINK you know) your opponent.  If you like to use your head in a game, you'll find yourself trying to conceive every possible motion of your enemy in order to counteract.  By the way, it's 5 guys chasing 1, but the 5 are playing blind: only clues are given as to where the 1 is.  Sounds great, right?  Well, that's because it is! --The smarter they are, the harder they fall.

Chels: I like the team aspect, but there's nothing stopping people from taking over your turn.
Ant: Fair, and you had a bad experience, if I recall. It's fine, but every other hidden movement game has handled the mechanic better, and the tokens can get frustrating. Go play Fury or Whitechaple.

A sentimental favourite.  I loved this game as a kid but [i]everyone[/i] I introduce it to hates it.  Still, I'm the one rating it, so there.  Nyah.

The game is a bit dry and boring the first time(s) you play, but the more you play the more you appreciate the design.  A shame that others won't give it more than one chance.

Played for the first time: Mr. X was catched too soon (5th or 6th turn) to being able to have a solid impression of the game. Although, I think our group liked it so I hope we are going to try it another time soon for having more arguments to rate it better or not.

Elegantly simple, intense and gripping. Very accessible to new players, though you have to be extremely attentive to the game's strategic complexities to win. Being Mr. X and running for your life is immediately terrifying! I immediately wanted to play again!

I would not play SY, because it is not a game. I played with friends, that just marked every spot Mr X could possibly go to with a coin and after each turn just expanded the cloud of possible Mr X locations and removed coins and possibities they could exclude.

After this exercise I realized that Scotland Yard isn't actually a game, although it offers some interesting design ideas and innovative game elements.

Because it is the essence of a hidden movement game, Scotland Yard is a little too abstract and AP prone for my taste.

I'd be happy to play it but would just rather play something with a little more theme attached to it.

It was a great first hidden movement game and made me realize I liked the genre, so overall I'm glad I picked it up and tried it.

As a kid, this was the first truly different gameplay mechanic that I learned.  Using the tokens to move around the city of London fascinated me, and I love the map of London.  I have a copy of this at my parents place, and picked up one for my wife and me, but over the last few years, this never hit the table much, so I decided to trade my copy (a new Ravensburger edition) and keep the older, more classic version at my parent's house.  Still have a lot of nostalgic love for this game, and I'll probably always keep a version around.  Great game to introduce to new gamers.  Easy to learn and a nice amount of strategy.

There are a couple of people I would suggest this game:

a) Fans of the detective theme. 
b) Those, who are looking for a game that relies greatly on cooperation between the players.
c) People who are looking for a high quality game for an occasion. (referring to the content of the box)

However, this is not the game that comes to my mind when someone's asking for s good game in general.

Suggestion: let the most experienced player be Mr.X, that way the game becomes a real chase for the evil master mind.

Scotland Yard is a pretty old game of cat and mouse. It's quite the nice game although a few human flaws make it somewhat inefficient to play at times (such as needing to 'throw them off' where you're looking). The new Bobbies are pretty strong, insanely so compared to the old version with only detectives and their tickets, so I may revert to playing the old way without them. Fun game, not the easiest to bring to the table, but I enjoy it all the same. Solid.

During my one play in a group of 6 people, I decided that Scotland Yard is really just a 2-player game.  One player tries to maximize openings while the other player uses the detectives to maximize coverage.  The game strikes me as a logic exercise that requires little (if any) strategy.

Scotland Yard is along with a couple of other games a pretty common household in German households. Many people don't know Puerto Rico, but Scotland Yard usually rings a bell. This has been one of Ravensburger's topsellers - at least in the eighties.

Why? It's a nice family&friends type of game featuring cooperative play (excluding the elusive Mr.X, that is).
However - at least if playing with kids - you might have a row about who's going to play Mr.X on your hands given what fun it is. 

This game however can easily become frustrating for the detectives if they cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. For this reason, four detectives, better five, are a must. Otherwise, you have too few people out there to catch the sly evil one.

Actually, I think this game works best as a two player game. One is Mr.X and one plays fives detectives. Still, a six-player game is also perfectly enjoyable.

Now, more than twenty years after its publication, it would be interesting to see a more intricate game based on the same system. Hm, I think I'll do something for home-use myself with many mechanics altered. Hong Kong, Istanbul or Stockholm would be interesting setting (given the topography of those places).

Based on 1 play with 6 players:

First impressions: This game is just unfair. We didn't see how the detectives were supposed to win like... at ALL. It will be really interesting to see how this holds up with repeated plays (i.e., how big of a difference it will make if we play smarter in the early game)

That said, it did a good job of making things feel tense... we were always one step behind him, which is a pretty satisfying feeling. What wasn't so satisfying was the certainty that we could never catch up.

The rules are really simple and I'd actually really like to try this with LESS people... seems like it would go faster with less cooks in the kitchen.

The ticket movement system is quite nice. It seems a silly that Mr. X actually has unlimited tickets... being able to (as the detectives) control what lines of transport he can use would add a whole new dimension to the game, I feel.

For me, the jury is still decidedly Out on this one.

Wow, it's so old but still so good. I like deduction games and the mechanics of this game are very streamlined! Always tension no matter which side you are playing! I like to play both sides, though it's perhaps most entertaining when playing Mr. X. I like the various options he has with black tickets and double moves. All in all it's a great deduction game; the box says 3-6 players but I think it's best when playing with 2 because then the detectives don't unveil any of their thoughts and it becomes harder for Mr. X.

I’ve got fond memories of this game from my childhood. This was one of my favorites, but I always wanted to be Mr. X and had to coerce family members into playing it. I’d be curious to see how this game has held up over time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is good solid, classic, cooperative gaming; of course, one needs to be in a group in which one of the players is fine with playing solo on the other side.  The amount of thought and strategy is really dependent on the players, so I can see it being adaptable with different types of gamers (more or less serious).  Finding out at the end how close the detectives came to Mr. X during the course of the game is quite entertaining.

A hidden-movement game of catch Mr. X.  One person plays Mr. X and secretly moves around London (exposing their location on specific rounds), while the other players play as the detectives trying to corner and catch the elusive mastermind.

This was the perfect family game. We took bets on how long Mr.X would be able to escape. Played it a little while back. Still fun with a group of adults, but catching the Agent was much harder than I remembered.

I love this game.  It's an asymmetrical 2-player game (they say you can play with more than 2, but you have a robber on one side, and the other players teaming together as the police -- really, a 2-player game).  As the police, it really stretches your mind.  You're always very anxious to see where the robber turns up next!  As the robber, it's great fun trying to escape the dragnet -- creeping out the back alleys, or maybe boldly charging right thru the middle!

Haven't played since I was a youngster. Perhaps I remember incorrectly, but I always had the impression it was impossible for the detectives to miss catching Mr X unless they made an error.  I'd like to try this again with a clever adult group and see if its worthwhile.

Family game

A really good thinking game that has tension and bluffing. It seems well balanced for a game with very different roles but MrX doesn't get away anyewhere near as often as he gets caught. It should only be played with two players unless the players sharing the cops are close to equal experience/assertiveness (otherwise it becomes two player with passenger(s)). A lot of people who give this game a low rating say it is too luck driven  but they really must have crap tactics as cops since they say Mr X almost always escapes.

The police department attempts to hunt down Mr X on the city map. Mr X becomes visible every so often to give the police force a direction to head. There is a management of resources of taxi(small move), bus (medium move), and subway (long move) as well as spatial reasoning of trying to keep up where the invisible Mr X is.

The first few times that i played (as a child), Mr X seemed to always win with easy. In time, I learned that with proper play the police will typically win. I am always pleased to play either side of this childhood game.

Light deduction game along the lines of Mr. Jack.  Here, one player is Mr. X.  Instead of trying to figure out who the bad guy is, the opposing player(s) move about the board as detectives, attempting to deduce X's location.  Movement occurs along different kinds of transportation which allow varying amounts of flexibility.  Each detective gets a set number of movement chips of each type which are given to X after the detective uses them.  X also has two double-move tokens and a few any-type tokens.  Every few turns X must reveal his or her location prior to that turn's movement.  Detectives may cooperate to find X.  If X is not found within 24 turns, X wins and may continue his or her reign of terror across London.

I do not enjoy this. I find the deducing to be enjoyable, but the game seems to come down to one side or the other making a mistake and then the side that didn't make a mistake wins. This is true of basically every deduction game but it is worse in these versus games because the players are versus each other.

Also, it is too easy as the criminal to accidentally break a rule and break the whole game.

Production: Pawns are clear, to allow one to see the spaces upon which they sit.  Tokens are easy to weild.  The map is pretty, but very convoluted in its routes, making it difficult to quickly assess distance.  Play: A rather brilliant combination of deduction and cooperation.  A problem I've had with it is that the game can end abruptly if the spy gets caught moving to a risky yet improbable location.  (2+0+2) (6 plays)

Co-operative games are all the rage nowadays, but Scotland Yard was doing a Co-op game long before Shadows or Battlestar. This one even has a traitor, sort of. Well you all know who the traitor is, you just don't know where he is. He has to tell you whether he's taken the bus, a taxi or the subway each turn and he reveals himself a few times during the game. The other players try to end their turn in the same station as "Mr. X". The game board is a pretty good map of London and the pawns are nice. It even comes with a viser for Mr. X so you can't see which part of the board he's looking at.

This is a great introduction Board game.  The simplicity of rules makes it easy for the timid player to feel like they are playing a "complex" game (other than boggle).  And using logic and strategy to trap Mr. X is a cool way to let people play together against the one person.  If you know a person who thinks they are "smarter" than everyone else ... have them play Mr. X and prove it!

5-19-11 edit: rating dropped to a 5 after a little more gaming experience.  I wouldn't really want to ever play this game.  Not that it's horrible, just that in my limited gaming time I can't see a situation where I would grab this one.

Maybe I'm just not a good detective, but this seems a little too random to me. Even when you've pegged the thief's location, there'll be a couple of choices as to where he's gone. The winner is whoever guesses right, not deduces right.

I prefer it as a two-player game, with one player maneuvering four or five detectives against the other player's Mr. X. You'll never capture Mr. X with three or fewer cops. In fact, you have to do everything right to catch him with four.

1 play, 3 detectives.  This was surprisingly fun and we were actually able to track Mr. X fairly well.  Well we mostly got lucky making coin toss guesses.  While I was proud of how we performed, I'm pretty sure it is nearly impossible to catch Mr. X with 3 investigators.  Even without all of his tricks, Mr. X need only stay on 4 point intersections and he should never be caught.  Want to try with 5.

RATING: 6
Another old German classic. Pretty good, but unabalanced. Hard to win as Mister X. The other problem is that it really does seem like a two player game in many ways. The detectives are supposed to cooperate, but this game seems particularly prone to the dominant player syndrome that can afflict co-ops.

This is a good family game, but in all the times we have played it I don&#039;t think Mr X has won more than once or maybe twice - possibly because the kids always want to be Mr X. It does not seem to hold much appeal to the adult gamers I play so it has only ever been played in the family. My kids would probably rate it at least an 8.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun hide and seek cooperative game whereby one person plays as Mr. X evading everyone else across London. The board looks great and while you can win by dumb luck, teamwork and planning are necessary if you want a good chance of victory. Would look a bit better if plastic miniatures were used for the detectives and bobbies. Pretty easy to play but a few more rules to take on board than your average light game.

A simpler version of Fury of Dracula.  I like assymetric games of hide and seek.  Our game did end a little early though as Mr. X was hemmed in from the start.  The board is hideous though.  Hurts my eyes to look at it.  It might be the only boardgame I've seen that poses a seizure risk.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Scotland Yard is a very fun and easy to learn hitting movement game that is a great addition to any boardgame in collection. One player is the thief secretly moving on the board and the other players are police officers trying to corner the thief. Brilliant and elegant design.

One against many deduction game where one player is trying to evade the detective players by moving via a secret map.  At several times during the game he must reveal himself.  Very hard to win as the lone player, but fun game.

I recently discovered this game and have had a lot of fun with it so far.  I've had difficulty capturing my partner when she plays as Mr X, but her superior skills at keeping track of game information and reading my facial expressions has led her to capture me several times!  Considering that she found it for only $2, this is probably the most fun per dollar of any game in my collection!

This used to be one of my favourites when I was a child. Being Mister X can be extremely thrilling, when your opponents chase your through the whole City and move just one field away from you. Playing the detectives feels very different, it's more like a puzzle, but it is equally fun. I really should try Letters from Whitechapel or Fury of Dracula, as more complex and adult versions.

A simple, pure, point-to-point deduction and movement game.   The odds seem stacked against Mr. X, but that still seems the more interesting role to play.  I don't think the game would have a very long shelf-life because of the repetitiveness, but still a game worth trying out.   I prefer the Fury of Dracula system which allows the hunters to gather clues from the trail and also allows the hunted to fight back.   Then again, this game is very short and that game is too long.

The first co-op game I ever played. Tough to find just the right number of players - too many detectives and it's impossible for Mr. X to win; too few and it's impossible to track him down and catch him. A good co-op game to play with a bunch of kids where you (the adult) are Mr. X and you let them work together to track you down.

Not a lot of strategy. Some luck involved. Something that a non-gamer could enjoy. Replayability not so good. More interesting for Mr. X 

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

I don't plan to play Scotland Yard any time soon.

This is technically the first german game I ever bought.  Back in the 80's around when I was 14 I went to the gamestore with the idea, "there must be an interesting boardgame out there that my whole family could enjoy!  Something better than monopoly but more accesible than D&D." 

I stumbled across this intriguing game which had a "game of the year" label on it so I picked it up.  I gave it to the family for Christmas and we played it, once... I liked it but my family just isn't that into playing games, so unless you herd them all together it just isn't going to happen.

So it's been sitting with my stuff for decades now.  I've played it perhaps five times in all those years.  It's interesting and fun, but simply gets eclipsed by so much else in my collection that it takes about a decade to roll around to pull it out again.

I enjoy the one-v-many style of this game, as well as the puzzle aspect associated with Mr. X's hidden location. I find that the detective role offers a more fun experience, but being Mr. X against an army of detectives is delightfully stressful. Once players get accustomed to the game, it begins to lose its footing, but considering it hails from the early 80's it deserves some props for sticking around.

Very fun game.  Cat and mouse style game where one player is Mr. X and utilizes secret deployment/movement only revealing his location every few turns, while the rest of the group act as detectives trying to catch him.  The game is a neat blend of social deduction and co-operative play.  

Playing as Mr. X can be really intense! Our family really enjoys playing this one.  I think we have the 2004 Ravensburger multilingual edition.

We've played twice so far.  The first was a four player game, which we think could be the toughest scenario since that is the minimum number of bobbies.  Mr. X won this game.  The second was a 2 player game with Mr. X vs five bobbies.  The bobbies won this game.  The game scales well as the extra bobbies make it hard for Mr. X to slip through the line of defense but Mr. X gets more hidden moves to balance it out.  Both games went to at least the second to last turn so the game lasted a while.  A good strategy game to outsmart and trap Mr. X or evade the bobbies.

I don't get why people think Intrigue or Diplomacy are the killers - those are games that show one to be untrustworthy in a gaming context.  This game shows one to be an awful bossyboots - as revealing of true nature as drunkenness and pickup basketball.

This is a fun, easy to learn game. One person plays as Mr. X. All others play detectives. The goal of this game is for the detectives of Scotland Yard to hunt down Mr. X.

This weekend, I played Scotland Yard for the first time in over 15 years.  The only players who took part then and now were my brother and me, and we had three other friends.  I was Mr. X, my brother two of the detectives and the others each had one.  We used the 1983 Milton Bradley version, which was in our parents' basement (we were up there July 4th weekend and we brought it back down to Arlington, VA with us to add to the collection of Settlers, Puerto Rico, Carcassonne and other games).

It was more difficult than I remembered to avoid capture, due to us all being in our early 30s now and not pre-teens.  The detectives collaborated very well in terms of blocking Mr. X's possible escape routes and forcing him to stay in one quadrant of the board until they could tighten the net.

I survived till turn 15, when Mr. X was totally cornered and had nowhere to move.  Great game with the only element of chance being players' starting positions.  One worth playing over and over, and a deserved winner of the 1983 Spiel des Jahr award.

Based on dozens of plays.
+ Co-operative aspect.
+ I love the way how ordinary paper can be used to record Mr X's locations, and the way how vehicle tokens cover those recorded locations. Brilliant!
+ Player pieces are partially transparent (at least in a version that I've seen) so that location numbers can be seen.
> I've played a variant more often than the original game.
- The map is imbalanced. Not even once has Mr. X managed to visit London Zoo and win a game.

I was kinda surprised by this one, although it is a classic one. The discussions among the detectives were really fun and interesting. A lot of bluffing (especially from Mr. X's side) is going on. I excepted this to be too random, but it really wasn't. Great design.

Great game to introduce people to board games, and I loved playing this when I was first getting into games. Once I learned about Letters from Whitechapel and Fury of Dracula, I decided that this game would probably be retired for me. More likely, I won't get to play again unless someone else owns it and pulls it out, but the odds of that are slim.

RATING: 7
First game of it.  Made it through 1/3 today (8-6-2011), liked it, and I'm looking forward to playing it all the way through the next time.  Planning on doubling the "tickets" handed out to the detective players, because the starting amounts for them are a bit on the weak side (which seems to make the game end, or start to end, far too soon).  If that works, that's how I'll set up the game each time.  One disappointment however:  Baker Street isn't on the game map at all!  Talk about unfair!  Maybe the newer version has Baker Street on it, but I'll still stick with the older version.

RATING: 7
I have only ever played two games of this in succession, one as a detective, one as the villain.  for some reason its never come out of the box again though despite having thoroughly enjoyed it both times.  villain makes (mostly) secret moves, but the detectives know which method of transport he has used. he periodically pops up on the board, and he needs to be captured.  great semi co-op game.

It's a game a feel would benefit greatly from things people are used to in modern boardgames like card-management (or token-management in this case), variable player powers, tighter boards (Scotland Yard has around 200 different spaces on the board).

It's a game that hasn't aged well, but I feel its ripe for reimplementation.

Definitely not my type of game. Choose to move to one of maybe three possible locations using one of three possible transportation cards in the hopes of catching Mr. X... not really any other choices (a few additional choices if you're playing Mr. X.

Scotland Yard is another childhood classic, and I remember playing many a tense game with friends and family. When not playing with children, however, the game is much too easy for Mister X who needs to actively taunt the detectives by keeping close to keep things interesting although it does become a little harder the more detectives you have. I recommend not playing with less than 4 detectives in any case.

Letters from Whitechapel has taken the basic idea and raised it to the next level.

I find this well-balanced as a two player-game. This way it is a lot more tough for Mr X and the time-frame gets also a lot shorter. It's very different from the other games I know, and has an engaging theme. For occasional plays, this is perfect.

RATING: 6
Thought more people would increase the fun factor, but I found SY was too simple for Mr. X, too difficult for the detectives, and not involving for Mr. X when it isn't his turn. There was a lot more talk going on between the detectives, but as Mr. X I could see that a lot of random luck is needed to win. It has a nice feel to it, but I think there's better deduction games out there than this.

My gaming group usually likes to come back to this game occasionally. The co-op aspect is fun, and if you have a really sneaky person playing as Mr.X, then it makes things more interesting. When I look at this game as a detective, it feels like Mr. X has too many advantages over the detectives. However, when I play as Mr.X I do feel boxed in.

This is pretty decent. Reminds me of Cluedo: The Great Museum Caper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Well designed and fun implementation of the old hide and seek theme, across London's public transport network. Although stated minimum is 3 players, Scotland Yard works very well as a 2-player, with one person deploying 3, 4 or 5 detectives. In this manner a sort of handicap system can be used. Much more fun to be Mr X so make sure you take it in turns now! Only downside is that it is easy inadvertently to make an illegal move (or to cheat - especially as Mr X) and merely waiting for the detectives to run out of cards seems a rather less than dramatic goal for Mr X. Finally, 145 little cardboard tokens are just asking to get lost.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting, but not a favorite of mine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In my experience, this game works best with four detectives chasing Mr. X. With any other number, it seems either too easy or difficult for Mr. X. With five players, though, this is a fun game that does require the detectives to work as a team. There are also a number of different, fun options for travel, particularly for Mr. X.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In my opinion, the biggest flaw of this game is that Mr. X seems to have the most fun in this game. There are even some folks wo always want to be Mr. X and don't like the role as detective. Other than that a nice co-op themed game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Depending on opening position it can be a difficult time for Mr. X, or near impossible if playing with adults.
That said, this is a fun cat and mouse game stripped down to the core mechanics.  Very tense as Mr. X, knowing others' positions and preparing for revealing one's self.  A great classic game, shame it took this long to get it to the table since childhood.

This is a great family game, and can scale well in number(2-6) and in age.  Young kids can always be aided along by adults, or older children.

One of the few games I have played that makes my heart race.  Playing against a skilled opponent is always a rush.

I think this really plays best with two people, one controlling Mr. X and the other controlling all the detectives.  The detectives are only effective if they operate as a team, and the best way to achieve that is to let one person make all the decisions.

Very good semi-cooperative game.  Number of players can affect game balance.  Four detectives seems about right.  Can get pretty intense for both the detectives and Mr. X when they are in close quarters.

I played this lots in childhood. I have the version with an actual baseball cap in it, which is super cool. I really enjoy this with one person playing Mr X and one person playing all the detectives. (The bizarrely obscure European version, [thing=55763][/thing] is also good.)

I still occasionally bring it to the monthly gaming group I run at my local cinema, where it gets some play.

Played 5+ Hard game to rate. The odd time I play it it has been the best game in my collection for the situation. Takes a couple of minutes to explain the rules, everyone knows what they are doing. All the players cooperate against Mr X which makes for a kind of bonding experience. Fun to play with the family and an occasionally seen relative or friend who happens to drop by. I find this game easier to explain and quicker to play than Lord of the Rings. The variants available in the file section have inspired me to dig this game out and give it another airing. August 04

RATING: 8
A great deduction game.  The only skill required is the ability to anticipate your opponents' moves, regardless of which side you're on.  It can be very tense.  It's quite helpful for Mr. X to have sunglasses; otherwise the players can see where he or she is looking, which can give away your position early on in the game.  My main problem with the game pieces is that it's difficult for Mr. X to secretly choose his moves using the pad device provided; it could have been designed much better.

Got this at a game auction for £3. DIdn't get chance to play it for months, but had a spell where we played it a few times. An interesting deduction game, with elements of co-operation...

The original hidden movement game.  This game spawned countless knock-offs.  More recently the ideas in this game have been made in better games.  Specter Ops, Fury of Dracula, and my favorite of the lot Letters from Whitechapel.  This game really shows its age. We found a lack of objective on Mr. X's part.  A lack of hope for the police force as they had to randomly cast about trying to guess where Mr. X was. I had this rated at a 7 based on my memories from highschool.  I gotta downgrade this a LOT.

It still has a game-play mechanic that hasn't been used too often in games ever since. I do think though that there is at least one game that improves this mechanic and almost perfects it. With the right group of people and presented at the right time, game can provide a loads of fun and joy. But for anything more serious, this is not a game to be choosing.

This is a fun little game of deduction, bluff, and area control.  I like the mechanism that gives Mr. X more options as players consume theirs.  It is also a fairly unique game, and very good cooperative play.

The lowlights are based on the game function, which is more of a puzzle than interractive play.  Sure, the players need to work together, but it is very analytical.  Also, the Mr. X player needs to get his/her enjoyment vicariously as they simply act to move and score the game.  In this sense, it is a Co-op game like Shadows over Camelot but the odd one out is a referee and not a traitor.

The first box I purchased ($1.5) was missing board but the rest of the game was there.  I now have three complete copies of this version due to goodwill hunting.  I will keep the Ravensburg game which I found that had the hat included (BONUS)!  I will sell the others at garage sale and hope to get my investment back.  
Gameplay is simple: one player is Mr x and moves about the board in secret, tracking their moves on a special board.  The others are detectives who are trying to dragnet the city to capture Mr X who has to make their presence known every 3-5 turns.  Each player get bus, cab, and transit tokens to move from station to station hoping to land on the same space as Mr X to win the game.  My family enjoyed it and we will certainly play again.

Szerintem jó játék. Nagy előnye van Mr X-nek, azért némi szabálymódosítással játszunk. Mr. X. a kezdő poziciónál is felfedi a kilétét. Miután a játékban több lépés lehetőség van, mint amennyi jegyet kapnak fejenként a nyomozók, ezért ők meg bérletet kapnak, azaz korlátlanul léphetnek. Sőt ha tovább akarjuk nehezíteni Mr X helyzetét, akkor ő kap annyi jegyet, amennyit eredetileg a nyomozóknak írtak + a duplázó + a két bónusz (fekete) jegy. Így némileg kiegyenlítettebb a játék, mert az eredeti szabályokkal játszva könnyen előfordulhat, hogy csak Mr. X élvezi a játékot, hogy átveri a nyomozókat.

A 'blind movement' hide-and-seek game that appeals to older children through its crime theme and use of the transport network. More an experience game than a strategy game as the system's very hard to balance: it's too easy for Mr X to escape with 2-3 detectives, too hard with 4 or more.

You can't go wrong with a game that includes a hat! Not only does it make Mr. (or Ms.) X feel special, but it comes in handy for partially obscuring your face. Can be quite a tense experience escaping from the authority, or a good round of cooperative teamwork, depending on what side you are on. A bit hard to read the map though (should have been a bit bigger with two numbers on each spot to read upside-down). Still, its a classic, and a nice change of pace from the norm.

-----------------------------

In [i]Scotland Yard[/i], one player takes the role of the elusive ‘Mr. X’, a criminal who is on the run from Scotland Yard, after some indeterminate crime. The remainder of the players take the role of the detectives, who are trying to bring Mr. X to justice. The game is played on a map of Central London, with several hundred locations for the players to move on, connected by taxi routes, bus routes, or links on the London Underground. All the detectives have a limited supply of tickets for each of the different modes of transport, placing a good timer on the game.

This game is a game of deduction, and trying to see into the mind of Mr. X, how he will move and how the detectives can best corner him. It also has a form of limited resource managements, in that the tickets that the detectives are given cannot be replenished, and are given to Mr. X upon their usage. This means that the detectives also have to make sure that they are not given Mr. X an undue advantage by being cavalier with their ticket use.  As they detectives need to co-ordinate their actions carefully, there is always plenty of discussion going on, and it is entertaining to Mr. X to listen to the assumptions and theories.

In conclusion, [i]Scotland Yard[/i] is a fun game that includes plenty of interaction between the players, and encourages teamwork against a common foe. On the other hand, it is also fun attempting to outwit the detectives when playing Mr. X, and listening to the wild speculation on the detectives’ part. 

[b]Pros[/b]
- Encourages good teamwork skills
- Almost no luck component
- Requires good resource management and efficiency
- No downtime; constant involvement

[b]Cons[/b]
- Games can get a bit repetitive
- Can be hampered by less experienced players

RATING: 5
Old version, box has lots of wear (no hat!).  Simple chase one player into a corner mechanic (like Mr. Jack, Letters from Whitechapel, Fury of Dracula).  Gets a little tedious when you get so close then the spy slips away (but not as bad as Dracula vanishing in Fury of Dracula).  The frustration level can be a bit too much for kids.

An interesting cooperative game of searching for Mr X.  The other players work together to search for and find Mr. X.  I don't know how often I would play this but it was a fun and different game from the types of games that I usually play.

Scotland Yard is OK as a co-op exercise though it would probably be better suited as a 2 player game of deduction bingo.  The game seems a little too easy for Mr. X.  The length also seems to become a bit of an issue if all the detectives are out of synch.  I couldn't stop thinking that all the detectives should just pool together their massive transit budgets and buy a friggin' chopper to hunt down that dastardly Mr. X...Stupid cops.

We've been playing this game off and on for 20 years. A good Mr. X should win every time unless he starts in a particularly bad spot. Yet, it's the chase that counts and the turn-by-turn tension that creates the excitement for this game. Years ago the social dynamic of the table would usually see 1 Mr. X with 1 or 2 detectives "dominating" the movement of all of the detectives. But this, thankfully, has changed and I believe it is best to let all detectives think their own moves out. The whole ends up being greater than the sum of it's parts.

Well we've just played our first game of Scotland Yard and I was very impressed...I played Mr X the master criminal trying to stay one step ahead of Detectives Gina & Harry(each playing 2 seperate detectives)....
The game is played on a map of London,with three modes of transport....Taxi...Bus and Tube...you have 24 rounds to survive or be caught...Mr X must reveal himself after round 3/8/13 and 24...
The game is very similar to Fury of Dracula...but much simpler,and yet IMO more tactical.

Overall we all really enjoyed the game and will definately be playing again soon...

I find this game works best with two players because it makes the game easier for the detectives to play a co-ordinated strategy. I didn&#039;t like the plastic pawns so I bought some white metal figures of Victorian Bobbies, Sherlock Holmes, Dr Watson and Jack the Ripper from a range of Call of Cthulhu fantasy figures. They made a good game even better!

Searching ebay I found this game from my childhood for $11.99 including shipping.  It plays very similiar to Fury of Dracula (or vice versa I can't remember at the moment which came out first), but once Mr. X disappears it can be very hard to find him again.  Limited resources for the trackers makes the game much more suspense-filled as well.

RATING: 6
A true classic that won game of the year way back when, its not really that dated IMO, I just played it in 2009.  

Deduction is the name of the game, it came out before Dracula, Dracula took the system and built on top of it and is an excellent game as is this one, both stand alone and there is reason to own both actually, Scotland Yard is more of a family game and very simple ruleset and Dracula is more for those who want more, same system at the core.  Both games also feel too long when adding more players, I think 3 players is the top choice for both games (with only 2, there is no co-op at all and discussion)  

Anyway played this with the family with the full 6 players and it went very well. First game I blew it quickly as Mr. X and was very short. Second game, the players were getting very frustrated when I would elect to use a double move right before revealing, so move and reveal and then move again, just out of their reach. Everyone was getting involved in the deduction which was great but the longer it went, the more disinterested they became and some eventually quit. The double does seem too powerful, maybe one would be better. It would also be better combined with removing one whole reveal round out of the game ie about 7 turns to shorten the game a little (went about 3 hours right to full number of turns)  

Against 5 other detectives on the board, it is fairly hard for Mr. X (where you reveal is key to your survival), against less, I fear it might be too easy, especially less than 4 and you would have to take away even more things to give the detectives a chance. 

Overall it was a fun game with the family, I might shorten it a little for the next time. 

Update: I could have shortened it but decided just to trade it, I don't play games very often with family.

It's a 1-v-many co-op, in which the many (members of Scotland Yard) are trying to track down the 1 ("Mr. X"), whose moves are largely hidden.  Different forms of transportation are available, which gives players different movement options on the map.  But each is limited by tokens, which must be spent to move.  Good bit of tension as players deduce where Mr. X is and try to close the net and capture him.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (April 2013)

Good game. I was surprised by it. The game has very simple mechanics, doesn’t take long and it is a blast to play (more over if you are mister x). I think this is the better game of hidden movement I have played, I prefer to play it over Letters from Whitechapel, Nuns on the run, Fury of Dracula and Ninja: Legend of the Scorpion clan. 

The theme, however, is really thin and all the game is named before surpass Scotland Yard in this regard. The components are adequate and I really dig the Mister X cap that comes with the game :D. It is very hard to be Mister X, I almost won my game but they caught me in the last turn, still it was a tense, fun game. 

Bottom line a good hide and seek game that I would like to play from time to time. Great for the family. It is a bit lighter than my regular choices but I’m thinking about buying it.

I have played this game a lot, and it is a good solid game.  The number of people going up against Mr. X is key to how hard it is for X to get away. Always fun and tense and often frustrating but in a good way for one side or the other.

I just got a Ravensberger edition of the game,and while I think it is interesting it comes with a hat, I don't think it makes up for the look of the board.  The older Parker Bros. edition from the 80s looks much better, mainly because the taxi routes are yellow, not white.  Why have white buildings and then white taxi routes? (maybe in London taxis are associated w/the color white, and not yellow as in the U.S?)

Old family game that holds up really well. Cat and mouse, deduction, pretty map, good use of theme. We played 2p with four detectives. The game was a bit boring in the turns when Mr. X wasn't revealed, especially the first three when we had no clue at all; but that might be because we didn't know what we were doing.

I really liked this game at first because it was one of the first board games I played, where you didn't use a die and that wasn't Chess, Go or Othello (Reversi), but after playing it several times we found that it had a balancing problem. 

I don't recall just where it tipped, but when we were many players it was next to impossible to get away as Mr. X and vice versa ... there is no number of players where you could not tell what the outcome would be.

So ... really great concept, bad balance.

Tive-o e perdi-o algures no final da adolescência. Nem sei bem como. No entanto era um jogo interessante passado em Londres, baseado na utilização de diversos transportes. Não percebo a relutância de algumas pessoas, mas eu recomendo esta pérola a quem o conseguir encontrar em segunda mão. Eu também o queria ter. 
Um congénere atual com algumas semelhanças é o Letters from Whitechapel.

RATING: 5
An involving and unique game.  Negatives: for the detectives it&#039;s a little like solving the same puzzle over and over, and Mr. X has downtime.  Doesn&#039;t seem to have the necessary zing... won&#039;t get played as much as most of our other games.

A deduction game using teamwork as one player is the villain, Mr. X, and the other players are Scotland yard detectives. With a table full of adults we readily dispatched Mr. X and I'm not sure that wouldn't always be the case.

MUCH better than the usual run of classics. Careful coordination is required of the detectives. It is amusing reading through the comments for this game. "Mr. X never loses!" "It's impossible for Mr. X unless the detectives are idiots." It seems most people rate this based on the skills of those with whom they play. 

How about a little more objectivity? This game features an excellent central mechanic of hidden movement with minimal clues. The 5 forced reveals for Mr. X provides a high degree of tension and is perfectly balanced by Mr. X's double moves and black tickets. A version of this mechanic became Fury of Dracula, which is also a pretty decent game, but cards in that game muddy up the pure brilliance of the original design. The reason I'm hesitant to rate this higher is that the unchanging geography of the board can lead to similar paths and approaches from game to game, that is, there are good places to hide and bad, and they are the same every game. The random set up helps, but does not resolve this completely.

Solid deduction mechanics... don't much care for the art in my edition, purchased from B&N a year ago.  It's hard on the eyes, imo.  I'd be very interested in a remake with a darker (both less garish and darker in mood) skin on it.  

I subtracted a full point for the appearance of my edition.  It's solidly made, just so difficult to look at.  I much prefer Letters from Whitechapel at this point for this style of game.

Childhood favourite which still sees an occasional play when a lighter game is required.  Recommend sunglasses for Mr X to prevent people guessing where he/she is looking on the board.  Best with all detectives in play so we often play more than one when there isn't max people.

RATING: 10
Discovered this back when I was in high school and enjoyed it well then. Only recently have I pulled it back out and begun to appreciate how brilliant it is. When all players are competent, the balance is perfect. There are many tense moments for both Mr. X and the Yard, and the tight escapes are exhiliarating. If you've spent any time in London, just pulling out the board puts you in a good mood. The theme works perfectly. Win or lose it's always a great time, and you always have a story you want to tell. This is the most satisfying cooperative game on my shelf.

Detective game. Fun if Mr. X isn't too cocky or risky. I was last game and the game ended too quickly. No one wanted to play it afterwards.

It's like a [b]simple but very plain[/b] Fury of Dracula.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Meh. A pretty average deduction game. I say average because the fun and tension comes from playing Mr X. The other players have no free will to decide their movements. Every movement must be in cooperation with the other players. You don't get any freedom to pull off anything.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A classic.  If you have one competitive person and the rest like cooperative play, this game rocks.  Assign Mr. X to the one and see if they can survive the group.

My husband found this for a dollar at a thrift store.  I've only played it once, but I'm pretty sure he wasted his dollar.  I think I actually hate this game and I don't usually hate many games.

Scotland Yard is an interesting way for a child to outwit their parents.

Or to fail to outwit them, but in a 2v1 game, even with two detectives per adult, the child has a distinct advantage.

EDIT 1/11/15. I don't know why I wrote that the way I did. I won a game of it with my dad and stepmother back when I was in middle school, but that hardly seems a reason to mention it. Oh well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nothing like watching the detective net close in on you and with a couple of sneaky moves escape out of the one tiny hole they couldn't cover! This is a very fun game that will have Mr. X on the edge of his seat and the detectives scrambling to close in on him only to groan to see him pop up somewhere else while the ticket supply dwindles. Great for larger groups. With fewer detectives I'd image it'd be a more difficult game for the detectives who already have a hard time with 5 players. My ranking is a 9 if I'm Mr. X, and an 8 or 7 if I'm a detective.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun icebreaker, good warmup for cooperative games. I should note that I hate the colors used in the new edition as it is much more difficult to track the routes than with the bright yellow/blue/pink of the edition I played 15+ years ago. The mechanics are simple to teach and I'll enjoy playing this with my kids when they are old enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great game of deduction where one player (Mr. X) is on the run from all of the other players. Everyone knows what type of transportation Mr. X is taking, but only knows exactly where he is at a few predetermined times. Mr. X also has a unique mode of transportation on the river and a couple of hidden movement tokens to give him a fighting chance. The more people playing this game, the better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an old game!  The more stressful (but fun!) it gets to be the one trying to get away when there are more people playing! Very suspenseful and takes a lot of strategy!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Childhood favourite. It is interesting that the chances of Mr X will improve if the detectives cannot dismiss the possibility of Mr X moving where he could be caught. Thematically it is odd that one side can run out of transportation options but the other can't. Apparently one edition solved this by making the detectives kids, but then I'm not sure how the rest fits together.

Thrifted on 9/9 2017 and 26/10 2017.

A classic game of investigation, which sadly seems far more boring in modern times. Still functions as a great gateway game for someone who is interested in say, Fury of Dracula, but has not gamed before.

My only gripe with this game is that it's much too easy for any less than 4 detectives.  Then, with that many people discussing everything it takes a long time with little action - most fun for Mr. X.

This one was fun as a filler game for a larger group of people.  I will hopefully pick it up at a thrift store one day. *Edit* I thrifted it for 1.99 from Goodwill.  Happy day.
**Edit** And it truly is a classic, the very best of the light cat and mouse style games.  It is a challenge to play Mr.X well and a pleasure to hunt him, as the board is so cleverly crafted to give just enough information, particularly after one of Mr.X's forced reveals.

I got this 1983 for my 10th birthday. Playing or chasing Mr. X is part of the best childhood memories I have. I even reminisce about one or two times when I actually dreamt about being Mr. X myself and being on the run in that big city. I was so immersed in the game. For me as a 10 year old Scotland Yard really was a close-to-reality experience.

I am going to play it with my children when they are old enough.

One of the players takes on the role of Mr. X. His job is to move from point to point around the map of London taking taxis, buses or subways. The detectives, the remaining players acting in concert, move around similarly in an effort to move into the same space as Mr. X. But while the criminal's mode of transportation is nearly always known, his exact location is only known intermittently throughout the game.

This game scores very high with me on Theme.  The idea of chasing a bad guy around London is just so cool, as is the 3 vs. 1 concept.  The mechanics leave a bit to be desired, since it's hard to know what the right mix of Detectives is to make sure the game isn't too easy for either side.  Another flaw is that finding Mr. X can sometimes just be a case of luck.  Despite these drawbacks, the idea of skulking around that cool (and accurate!) map of Central London is good enough that I like playing this game once in awhile.

This is Fury of Dracula with all the tiny and mediumsized chits and rules removed. And, once you find that bastard, you don't have to fight him. Mr X: "Well chaps, you got me. Blimey!" Because he is a gentleman, he got style. Nothing like that bloody fella from the eastern europes.

Je l'ai depuis tout petit... et je continue encore d'y jouer occasionnellement...
Une chasse à l'homme est lançé dans Londres, à la recherche de Mister X...

Voilà qui sémera le doute aux enquêteurs...
Un jeu rythmé, intelligent... et plein de suspense (du moins, jusqu'aux 4 derniers coups, si ils ont lieux, qui en général, sont largements en faveur de Mr. X).

RATING: 7
Fun, almost silly but not quite. The fun here is in the addictive play, not in the end game itself. Try hard, enjoy, don't care who wins!

NOTE: We have each detective retain their last used ticket so as to remember their current mode of transport - this prevents arguments and helps move the game along.

Also, when Mr X 'blinks out' after having revealed himself we put a black cube on the board in his 'last known position' for one full turn until Mr. X goes again - this also saves time and hassle (players could write this down, but the game is more fun this way) - each player at the beginning of that turn can see where Mr X was. This nicely avoids the problems inherent with people taking bathroom breaks and missing the action (explaining what happened only takes longer, always), for example.

This isn't a cooperative game since the players don't all win together as one group. This is a Team game where there are exactly 2 teams.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
2 games in one: For the person playing Mr X, it's an adrenaline-filled chase filled with narrow escapes and an impending sense of doom.  For everyone else, it's a lighter affair, an exercise in calm cooperative strategy.  Playing as either side makes it seem an impossible task (escaping or making an arrest).

Holds its own in a social setting and is pretty fun.  Two or more players (detectives) spend a limited number of resources to hunt down the moving Mr. X, another player (whose location is kept secret, but is recorded) working to elude the detectives, also with a limited number of resources.

A fun deduction game. You and 4 other detectives work together to capture a criminal. The detectives have a limited number of move, while the criminal moves hiddenly. The game is made for 2-6 players. but can be played with less with one player controling more detectives.

Scotland yard is a decent game. It is brain busting trying to anticipate Mr. X's moves and corner him though. It requires an alpha personality to coordinate everybody (which everybody hates in a co-op game) or exceptional teamwork.

I would like to like this more... Nice idea, but because all information about the cops is in the open, the players (that I've played with) end up relying on one assertive player to make the decisions.

A classic game that would have probably been significant in 1983.  Enjoyed the hidden movement mechanic as mr x, but don't think the game was as fun for the investigators.  More modern versions of this mechanic have a few more layers, and the double move tokens seem over powered.  Would still be fun to play with kids.

Played this with 3 other players, one of whom played Mister X. I found this game to be too random and relying too much on chance. We ended up capturing Mister X, but by luck. I've played Fury of Dracula and can't see myself ever playing Scotland Yard again after tasting Fury. Our Mister X is also usually our Dracula (and a very challenging Dracula, at that!) and felt powerless. Not a very satisfying experience, especially after Fury of Dracula.

RATING: 6
Good deduction game. I think being Mr.X is the best way to enjoy the experience; as a detective you can feel yourself kind of lost and blind all the game, despite those turns when the bad guy's location is revealed. Several plays seem to be necessary to take on both roles appropriately and making the game a bit more challenging and exciting for everyone. The board is a piece of art! in fact the whole materials in the box are really fine. I want to give it another try. 

I bought my own copy of the game for less than 2 dollars at a flea market! Didn't come with player pieces but I will craft them soon.

Pieces crafted and game played twice. With the right group this game can be very fun, although can be very difficult to win as Mr X. I like it better now than my first play, good cooperative! Up from 6.5 to 7.5 

After more than 6 plays Mr.X had 0 wins, but last night finally a friend made it. Long before 24 turns it started to be really boring for the detectives, just like in my very first play. Scotland Yard is a good game but not one I want to play often, down to 7.

My wife loves this, remembering it from childhood. It's not a bad deduction game, but I find those diverting at most. I can have a good time whether I win or lose, but never really feel challenged. I think this has to do with the fact that you're reliant on the deductions of other players rather than your own wits. I much prefer the challenge of competing against everyone else. Whilst, like most people, I prefer to win, I don't care if I don't in player vs player because I know the mistakes I made, or the skillful moves others to complete the game for you made that produced the result. Relying on others is just too frustrating. I'm not a huge fan of co-operatives. I just switch off and find them boring.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Game in a Nutshell: Ride the buses, cars and underground around a map of London as one player plays Mr. X and all the other try to find his secret, moving location.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: I like the idea of a cat and mouse deduction game that's simple enough to pick and play but with enough "game" to work with that it has some legs. Pretty easy to teach. Simple to play. Nice being playground of a map to skirt around on.

Cons: The interest of the game is solely on the shoulders of whoever is Mr. X. If they know what they're doing, things can be a challenge. Otherwise, it my be a short short game. There's a certain amount of guessing game that has to be played. Could suck if you have one of those bossy players.

Other: Maybe it's unfair of me to rate this game so low based on only having played un-interesting games with weak competition. But it does take a certain brain wiring to get a natural feel for it which may not lend itself well in this one vs. all setting.

Best Use: I think kids would get a kick out of it such that it would be a fine family game.

Nice co-operative game - ahead of its time. Lacks the polish of recent games such as The Lord of the Rings.

The balance of the game shifts considerably based on the number of players, but this works OK (as long as Mr X knows it is very likely he will get caught with more players).

A fun time with the kids (i.e. all of the kids try and find an adult as Mr X).

this is ok if everyone playing has roughly the same experience with the game.  sometimes can work fine with Mr X being more experienced.

Eh, I don't know. Certainly it's unfair to compare this to modern releases like Mr. Jack, but the incredibly busy board is a hint - the game is overly busy too. And is decided on the basis of luck. Try it if you're curious, but don't expect much.

A very challenging game of cat and mouse. It's a bit of a brain burner as many deductive games are, but with the twist that one player actively plays the criminal on the run. I prefer the role of Mr X who has the strategic challenge of figuring out an escape versus being one of the seekers who has to deduce where Mr X is.

I'm not convinced that it is balanced as an adult game but I think it will work well with growing children as an intermediate level game.  Childern seem to love being Mr (or Mrs X) even if with help of one parent.

Rating 6: Enjoyable in the right circumstances
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is really a two player game, and that's how I prefer it.  One player is Mr. X, the other runs all the detectives.  Otherwise, it is either: one detective dominates all the rest into a plan; or, the detectives are all going their own way and Mr. X never gets caught.  Playing Mr. X is more fun than playing detectives (to me, anyway).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent game for a group of 5-6 players who want a casual mystery game experience.  The nice thing about this one is that the player who is playing as Mr. X still has stuff do while the other players are trying to catch him/her.  He gets to sit and listen to their strategies and figure out his next moves while the other players are trying to figure out where his pawn is located.  Can get really tense for all players if played correctly.  This is also a great family game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Cooperative game of police trying to catch a thief in London. Thief and police move one space at a time, but either can take ferries or the train. The thief leaves evidence behind when he moves allowing the police to close in on his position. Not a bad game of deduction of trying to find where the criminal is hiding. Since police all work together, it is more of a 2 player game, rather than multiplayer. Still a decent game of interaction, rules are easy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've only played a couple of times, but each game has produced the ideal result of both the police and Mr X having the feeling that they're so close to defeat but it's on a knife edge. I really don't know how the designers managed to make it so well balanced. 

It's over 30 years old and pre-dates most of the eurogame revolution but I feel this game stands up really well today.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Would get an 8 if it didn't have the retro components. Wonderful game idea and design though. Very little luck other than starting location, great strategy involved, lots of fast-paced decisions and quick pace, a great feel of being chased/doing the hunting before the time runs out, and a great feel of deduction and detective work as you do it. Great hour long game for groups.

UPDATE: This is a fun enough game and I like but considering how much more I like Letters from Whitechapel and that the learning curb and length arn't that much more for that game AND it has a better theme and greater strategy, I'm going to always prefer Letters from whitechapel. The components being so dated on this game are the final nail in the coffin for not keeping it anymore.

Deduction game.

Okay, gotta be fair. It's not a terrible game, but it's not something I'll play with my friends. It's fine for less demanding players, kids, or adults playing with kids. I'll give it a much higher grade for that.

It's more of a cooperative game where one player (the criminal) is trying to evade the other players (the detectives). The setting is London, and the criminal is using taxis, buses, and trains to make his escape. Each turn the criminal records his location and hides it beneath a piece of cardboard which shows exactly which mode of transportation he used. Every few rounds he must reveal his current location to the detectives who must catch him in a certain amount of rounds, or else lose the game to him.

Not a bad game per se, I just have trouble with games like this and Nuns on The Run where you gotta track without seeing. It also hurt my head calculating the area and movements.

RATING: 4
It's much too easy for Mr. X to win, with his constant ticket income and his double moves and his clever nickname.  On the other hand, some people say the detectives always win.  In those cases, I can only assume that the players controlling Mr. X were just clueless;  I played this game many times in my youth, with intelligent people, and the detectives only won about 10% of the time, usually through dumb luck.

RATING: 6.9
All these years later, I'm not sure that hidden movement has been done better. The game is an asymmetric optimization puzzle for the detectives, in which they figure out how to best spend their limited supply of tokens to close a net around Mr. X. For Mr. X (best pun in gaming?), it feels different... less about closing off options than keeping them open. Nicely designed, with very little extraneous chrome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I would probably only play this with 2, as you need to have the detectives work together to have any chance to catch Mr.X. With multiple people playing detectives, one person really needs to take charge and coordinate all the moves... leaving the others players twiddling their thumbs.

Best with two players, using all the detectives. The age shows; For example, certain essential movement issues are not mentioned in the rulebook at all. 

Played this a lot as a kid. I still have the same copy, and aside from a little bit of shelf-wear on the box, the game looks brand new, and not a single piece is missing. Apparently I was quite a professional gamer even back then, and knew how to treat my games :P

RATING: 8
Original, atmospheric game which works best with Mr. X against four (if all handled by one player) or five detectives (since players might not agree... anyway, aren't cooperative games most of the times anything else than masked solitaires?). Requiring deduction, clockwork coordination and a good administration of tickets (don't give Mr. X too much underground!) on one side and good planning plus quite strong nerves on the other, the game stays thrilling from the start to the end providing that the detectives don't argue too much (the only element of frustration or boredom here).

If you happen to love London by the way, Scotland Yard is even more charming!

RATING: 3
I'm not even sure why, but I remember that I hated this as a kid. Might be due to the fact that usually playing Mr. X was the fun part and with multiple detectives, being the detectives felt like you had less of a game, so there was always a big fight over, who was allowed to be Mr. X. 
Should really be a 2-player game, otherwise it feels like you're playing half/or even less of a game when you're playing the detectives. 

These days I would proabably appreciate it more, if it wasn't for something like Mr Jack, which fills exactly that spot of a deduction game for me and has some more interesting choices added.

The game components are attractive and of good quality, but the game was rather a disappointment to me.  Figuring out where Mr. X was at any given time proved to be fairly difficult, and travel by any means of transportation except underground was excruciatingly slow. I like cooperative games, but I felt cooperation was relatively futile in this situation.  The odds of catching Mr. X increased with the number of detectives, but the pursuit was not as exciting as I hoped it would be, since it proceeds at a snail's pace.  I'd be willing, but not eager, to play again.(3+2)

Update (29/03/17):
Played as 5 detectives against my 6 year old who was playing the game for the first time. He unfortunately played the game wrongly right off the bat. Even so, I thought it was more fun playing with 2 players than the full complement of 6 as I could plan and strategize as the detectives on my own without needing to consult another person. I can see how the game can get tense at moments as the detectives close in on Mr X and he will need to either choose to get out of the trap as quickly as possible or make plays to bluff his location. Hope to try it with the spouse soon.

Played with 6. Very long and drawn out. Was Mr X and had to give the game away as the others, who were all new players, were frustrated at not being able to find me. This is essentially a 2 player game. Need to try with 2 to see if there is any hope in keeping this game in my collection

My brother-in-law and I like this game.  My sister-in-law and wife only like it if they're Mr. X.  Otherwise, "it's too much like chess."  This logical prediction exercise is definitely not for everyone.

Edit: We now like to play with the kids.  We find it too slanted toward Mr. X, especially with only three detectives, so we generally allow the detectives unlimited bus and underground tokens.  It takes away that one interesting aspect of planning, but it eliminates being halfway through the game and everyone already being annoyed because it is obvious they won't catch Mr. X.  I suppose if we played with 5 adult detectives, that fix would not be needed.

Elegant and simple yet requires careful thought about moves. Quite different to most other euro games due to the hidden movement. 

Plays best with 2 (4 detectives) or 3 (2+2 detectives). 2 player is a real battle of wits, 3 player has more of a teamwork/discussion feel. 4 is awkward, because 3 detectives is not enough to be balanced, and 4 detectives don't divide evenly. I recommend having a 4th (shared) detective anyway. 5 player is fine, but it's best if the 'casual players' play detectives and the more serious gamer plays Mr X (playing just 1 detective is probably not interesting/challenging enough for hard-core players, and careless players often get themselves cornered early). 6 player is like 5, but the detective team has a significant advantage.

A good 2 player cat and mouse game. The detective is attempting to keep the ever broadening branches of possible moves in their head, moving their detectives to close off as many possibilities as possible, encouraging the thief towards a likely location where the detectives can strike quickly after the next location revelation. The thief is simply trying to move so as to keep as many movement possibilities alive as possible, and, towards mid-game when the net is closing, arrange it so there's a quick and fast escape to the other side of the board where the detectives have too little time to draw another net close. Good fun.

Must have enough people, working together, to catch the criminal.  The social interaction, and putting group deductions into action is cool.  Spotting the criminal is one thing; another is to catch them.  But I found the game a little long, and a little dry.  Perhaps it is one of those games where it is only as fun as the collective zeal of the group.  I've only had one good experience, out of over a dozen playings, with this game.  I must play it again.

Wohoooo! This has been a blast! been playing this with my friends and everybody has been enjoying it. I really like it that the game mechanic slightly favours the investigators even though Mr. X can listen to all the discussions. Game has been very interactive and the co-op aspect has been a blast, investigators feel very engaged in the discussions around the map. Excellent and great fun!

The game is sometimes a bit slow, but it is an interesting game nonetheless.  Complaints that the detectives win only by luck are spurious: part of the role of the detectives is to constrain X's choices so that he has few escape opportunities.  Well-played detectives can make life heck for X.

In this many-vs-one cooperative game, a number of players as detectives chase down a player playing "Mr. X", using various modes of transportation in London.  Every few turns or so, Mr. X must reveal his location, giving the detectives something to work with.  I'm not really a big cooperative game fan, so while there was some excitement as we honed in on Mr. X, I generally would prefer other types of gaming.

TRY Mar/06: Good fun.  I was Mr.X the 1st game (detectives ran short on Taxi tickets), and now I'd like to try the detective side.  On retrying this, it DEFINITELY needs 5 detectives to challenge Mr. X.  And the game feels 'tired' upon replaying again too quickly.

RATING: 6.5
I am not a huge fan of games where many co-operate to defeat a single opponent, but providing all the co-operating players are of a like mind then this works fine.  It feels as if the game is too much in favour of the fleeing villain unless all 5 detectives are used, particularly for novice detectives, which could be balanced by reducing the number of double-moves.  As others have pointed out, this can be played as a two-player game with one taking on all the detectives (my preferred way of playing); in this case, additional rules are needed to balance the game if all 5 detectives are used, e.g. allow Mr.X to use the spare white ticket once to send a detective back to Scotland Yard.

Picked this up dirt cheap from an outlet store years ago (Ravensburger edition with cap) and had played a few games on my iPad, but only just got this to the table a couple of weeks ago. It's a nice deductive game, but is really a two or 3-player game at its core. You can add more players, but the detectives need to consider their moves collectively, so a dominant player usually emerges.

RATING: 5
R picked this up for me at a thrift store for $1... it had all its pieces and is in excellent shape. Fairly decent for a $1 game. This is a deduction game -- one player is Mr. X who is secretly moving around the board. It is up to the other players to find him or her. Sadly, this really requires more than two players, so while I enjoyed it, it won't hit the table much.

It's a fine game of pursuit. Make sure your Mr. X knows what he's doing. It plays well, but it's vulnerable to one person taking a leadership role a-la Pandemic - if there's only one bossy guy at your table, make him Mr. X.

RATING: 5
Been a long while since I've played this one, and I'm basing my rating on the mixture of suspense & frustration the game ultimately gave me back then. Have finally played it again.  Conceptually, it's pretty clever, though the odds against Mr. X seem unusually steep.  Once a cordon is established, it feels as if he can only get by with a matter of pure luck.

This is a great cooperative/competitive game. With full communication among detectives it's almost impossible for Mr. X to win. Playing that detectives cannot communicate makes it a bit more challenging. I got this game as a kid when it first came out and still enjoy a couple games a year.

Cool game (particularly the detailed map of London), but my biggest complaint is the player who is Mr X having to disguise which part of the board he or she is looking at.  My roommate and I discovered that our favorite way to play was to set the game up and then take our turns over the course of a few days or weeks when the other person was out of the room.  This variation works well as a 2-player game, with one player taking turns for all the detectives at once.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Precursor to Fury of Dracula, there's a lot here as a semi-strategic party game.  In pure deduction, this can feel almost like stumbling around London trying to find a guy that nobody is willing to help you find.  Basically your best hopes are pinning Mr. X somewhere in a corner then mathematically closing the trap to keep him there.  A much more entertaining game for 3-5 than it is with 2, where interaction between detectives keeps things lively.  Overall, I prefer to keep this game restricted to the party circut.  There's enough strategy for some light banter, but it can really drag with no real reward for a long time.  Additonally, there are some games where you just never close the trap, either because of a detective's mistake or just bad luck.  In these cases it hardly feels like a game at all, you could just roll dice and give the high roller the victory.

A co-operative game which sounds good in reading but in gaming experience is something different. I'll only play this 2 players as with more detectives you may find one competitive and astute player dictating moves to other detectives to ensure capture of Mr X. I find being Mr X a more exciting game experience rather than the dry, dull,  analytical elimination procedure of the detectives, hence the inverse design of Pyramid appeals more.

A basic variant of the hidden identity game, such as Mr.Jack or Fury of Dracula. The mechanics are deceptively simple, but the game does faciliate a lot of communication between the players and that is what makes the game fun, that is, only if you play with the right people of course. That being sad, playing Mr.X is much harder than it seems.

Scotland Yard is tricky.  It is always a good game... but sometimes it elevates to a great game with the right mix of people and action.  But we seem to have the opposite problem of everyone else.  Everybody in our group always want to be one of the detectives... although there are never any objections to being Mr. X.   We invariably play with the full complement of players but we seem to always have a hard time catching Mr. X.   I would say we catch up with him about 40% of the time.  Sometimes the game seems a little bland and other times it is extraordinarily tense.  This is a  good game with a great board and presentation... but who you play with really determines how the game flows.

Opened.  Played many times.  Good condition with two missing components:  Mr. X pawn and one of the 125 tickets included in the game (I think it is a bus one - breakdown of tickets not provided in the instruction manual).  Box in decent condition - will provide pictures before trading if this is a concern.

This is a good game to play with the family especially with littler kids. My family had fun playing this game trying to find Mr. X, and everyone wanted to take a turn actually being Mr. X.

For the littler kids that want to be Mr. X it is more of a challenge as they tend to just stare at the board where they are located so it makes it easier for them to be found.

This is a genuine classic, well worth its reputation. My general feeling is that it is one of those games (like A&A) that while being officially multi-player is really a 2 player game, one player hunting, the other playing Mr X.

This is the game that started it all: collecting games instead of playing collectible games.  It can be a good game, but unless all the detectives participate, the end up carried by everyone else.  Player balance is difficult, and detectives are prone to let one person take over while everyone else goes and plays something else.

A good fast game...at least for me when I'm Mr. X.  I still have to work on my overall strategy, but this one is pretty good and will probably stay at a 6.

One vs. everyone. Neck and neck with Letters from Whitechapel for my favorite in its category.

It's a competitive deduction game where a team of 1-5 players compete against one person. That nemesis moves invisibly around the board, and the others must locate and capture him using a variety of clues he leaves behind.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played this once and did not enjoy it.  It is an interesting game of hide and seek but in our game Mr. X always had plenty of possible moves to make and catching him would have been pure luck. Our strategizing could only take us so far.  I think it would be fun to play as Mr X but that is the only player who is really enjoying the game.

The board is nicier than NY chase but I still prefer the later because of the addition of the helicopter and the barriers. Still an exciting game when you are the thief.

Finally played it 2008-02-28 after hearing about it for years.  Enjoyed it, but it didn't live up to my over-inflated expectations.

Elegant rule system.  Pure strategy except for the player-induced chaos/randomness of hidden movement.  One can and should think carefully.

I'm not so into the team-vs-one aspect.  For the detectives to win, they really need to cooperate and plan carefully as if they were one player running a set of detectives, while I tend to think of team games as a bit lighter and more social.  It's also more abstract/dry than Mr. Jack (another chase-themed game).

Race around London trying to catch Mr. X.  One player is Mr. X and has to move around the map, revealing himself periodically, while all of the other players (Scotland Yard) try to corner him in and land on his space.  Can become quite tense when Mr. X has to reveal himself in a  part of the map with limited escape options and on subsequent turns Scotland Yard tries to predict what escape route he is using. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Scotland Yard is a light  easy to learn game that engages a large number of players.  In Scotland Yard One player  plays an escaped criminal and all the other players play investigators trying to track down the criminal(Mister X)  through the streets of London as  Mister X travels by Bus boat Taxi and Underground...always leaving a trail of clues behind him as to his whereabouts. 

Pros: Simple Rules, Cooperative fun for the  whole family, fun deduction aspect, fast and easy set up 

Cons: repetitive game play, no deep decision-making, Difficulty does not scale well with the number of players

--Aug2005-- Low rating reflects emotional scarring left by immediately younger brother who's far, far better at this than I will ever be. :-)

In a bunch of plays (all more than 20 years ago), I don't believe I ever caught said brother when he was Mr. X; nor do I believe he ever took more than 5 turns to find me when I was Mr. X.  Bah.

One of my favorites.  Double think galore. This is out-thinking at it's best.  It's hard to find a game with more tension as you really start to box in Mister X...  you'll agonize over covering the gaps so Mister X doesn't slip away.

Great in it's simplicity.

Bon, normalement, Scotland Yard n'est pas vraiment prévu pour être joué à deux, mais finalement il n'y a que peu d'intérêt à former une équipe de détectives, étant donné que toutes les informations sont disponibles pour tout le monde : un seul détective peut donc prendre les autres en main.

Maintenant, chez moi Mr X a la vie dure : en une dizaine de parties, je ne l'ai jamais vu s'échapper face à quatre enquêteurs.

RATING: 7
An all-versus-one deduction game, takes a twist on the cooperative genre.  All players (except the one) try to catch "Mr. X" in the streets of London.  Using a unique hidden movement system, players deduce the location of Mr. X by his last known location and modes of transportation, and then trap him or force him into limited decisions.  A well designed game, although quite heavy on the brain can make the audience for this game limited.  It also tends to favor a "one person makes all the decisions" mechanic, if one person is too "extroverted".

This is a game where it is too easy for one or two people to control all the detectives. Additionally, Mr. X is clearly not part of the group. Finally, depending on how good the players are, the balance between the detectives and Mr. X is off.

RATING: 7
This is a very unique game, or if it's no longer unique, at least it was original when it was released.  Can the rest of the group corner and hunt down Mr. X?  A lot of factors involved - mostly it's Mr. X's stealth, creativity and originality that determines whether he gets caught.  But, occasionally the detectives make brilliant moves when you least expect it.  The player who plays Mr. X needs to "get it", otherwise you're all wasting your time.

This is a game that I highly enjoy, but it takes a time or two through it to get it in your blood.  This was an early MB game that was non-traditional, and probably hooked me on deeper games at an early age.  It's also got a unique mechanism of one player trying to escape all the others, who are cooperating.  With new players, I'll play the bad guy, but help along their strategies some.  I won't tell them where to move, but will point out best practices and gotchas (Be close to or on a subway stop the turn before MrX reveals himself!)  With a talented criminal, we take away the 2x move cards.

I played this with my family dozens of times while I was in high school (late '80's) and with friends many times since.  It is one of my all time favorite games.  Even though Mr.X rarely escapes (less than 1 in 10 plays), everyone wants to play him.  I find the biggest mistake of the detectives is getting over eager and trying to catch Mr. X in the first 5-6 turns.  Patience is a virtue in this game, for both the detectives and Mr.X.  I really need to find my own copy!

I played an old edition with absolutely charming visuals that immerse you in the simpler days of yore (the 1980s). It's a long slow moving game (at least with 2) and we, the n00bs, found it hard to win with Mr. X. Probably takes some time to learn the map and to really get into the double think mode. Me, I'll take Mr. Jack over it any day. Not sure if I was enamoured enough to seek out the multiplayer experience of it. But wouldn't mind playing here and there, just because of the theme and atmospehere.

This game is a two player game. One plays the 5 detectives and one plays the robber. Strangely enough, it is pitched at multiple players playing the detectives, who are then supposed to cooperate, which seems rather silly, since all the detectives have one goal and win or lose together.

Not my favourite co-op.  There is an optimal way to play the game and usually one player finds it out and then guides the team along that path.  Thus, this might be best as a 2 player game, with Mr. X facing off with a single opponent.

Much like fury of dracula but there are no cards or battles. Nothing in this game helps enhance your characters. You simply discard a taken and move that route. This game is really just a big cat and mouse game and I realy liked dracula more so then this one.

Very clever system.  There are a number of fun choices, following intuitions and playing against likelihoods.  The tension is high for Mr. X and the cops are forced to cooperate.  Arguably more of an exercise than a game, but it is entertaining to play through.  I like the map and how everything works together.  If you are looking for a cat and mouse system look no further.

I came to this after playing the old GW Fury of Dracula and this has everything that game has without the randomness, turn losses, and overall time.  This game ends right about where it should whereas FoD lasts about two hours too long...

RATING: 6
Played once.

A cat and mouse game that plays like a stripped-way-down Fury of Dracula.  Up to 5 investigators are trying to catch Mr. X.  The investigators and Mr. X both use tokens to move from point to point on a map of London.  There are Taxi, Bus, and Underground tokens.  The investigators have 22 tokens each to catch Mr. X by landing on his space.  The Mr. X player has fairly unlimited tokens, but he must place each token in a display that is a record of his transportation choices.  Every 5-7 turns, he must "surface" by placing a token on his current location, so the other players can deduce his possible route from that point.  Mr. X also has Hide and Double Move tokens that can help him escape close calls by either masking his form of transportation or making two consecutive moves on his turn.

I rated this like FoD, as an OK game with some challenge that I would play sporadically.    I like the idea behind the game, but didn't enjoy the kind of deduction involved.  We played the newer Ravensburger edition (black and blue box) and used three detectives against Mr. X's three Hide tokens.  It just seemed like we'd have to get incredibly lucky to actually pin him down, since there are so many movement options (including doubling back whenever you want).  Perhaps with a full complement of investigators, the game would put more of a squeeze on the bad guy.  

That said, I think that this would be excellent for the younger recommended ages.

RATING: 7
A fun collaborative, especially when you want to play one game with lots of players.  The joy here is working with your other detectives, and there is some nice drama with each reveal by Mr. X.  I might downgrade this one to a 7, as I'm not so sure I'd suggest playing this.  However, I've never been Mr. X, and I think that it's likely much more fun on that side of the coin.

UPDATE:  Finally got to be Mr. X and really enjoyed it - it's so tense!  As long as I get to be Mr. X from time to time, I can see suggesting this game, so keeping it an 8.

UPDATE #2: I think that unless I get to be Mr.X, I wouldn't suggest this, although I will generally be willing to play it regardless.

When the detectives work as a team, the game works brilliantly. For Mr. X, the table talk can be gratifying or nerve-wracking, depending on how close the detectives are. It's a game you'll be thinking about awhile afterward, though it's much more fun to play as Mr. X. Either way, you need chatty detectives. With the right group, it's a 7 or 8. With the wrong one, it's a 4 or 5.

RATING: 6
3 plays (1 session), 5er (1 detective each)

Wow, being Mr. X is hard! Maybe it would be better with one less detective (total 4 players)?

This is a pretty interesting, simple deduction/hunting game. It has a unique twist: Mr. X must reveal his position periodically, at known intervals. The movement rules -- with 3 modes of transportation each creating partially overlapping but different networks on the board -- is also pretty cool. 

Like most of these one-vs-many games, I prefer being on the ONE side; less having to talk about stuff, figure out a plan ... down with teamwork! For deduction-type games, I'd also prefer the more pure games (e.g., Deduce or Die, Code 777, Sleuth). For 1-vs-many, I like more complex games like Friedrich or Descent.

Maybe a 7 or 7.5 if I am playing Mr. X, or maybe as a 2-player game with multiple detectives?

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The rules are very simple: Everyone gets a random starting location (Mr. X hidden; rest put pawns on board). 

Each round, Mr. X moves (using any mode), tracking his position and revealing only the mode (except for up to 4 times); twice in the game, he may move twice on a turn. At predesignated steps, he reveals his position. Then, players (in any order?) move using one of their movement chips (10 taxi, 8 bus, 4 underground). If a player cannot move (no appropriate transport chips left), skip turn. 

If Mr. X is ever at the same location as a detective, he loses and they win. Mr. X wins by remaining unfound after 24 steps.

I had zero fun when I finally played it, but that might have been due to the circumstances.  On the other hand, I won't ever request it unless my opinion dramatically changes.  For some reason, I don't like these types of games, such as Nuns on the Run and Mr.Jack despite the fact I enjoy logic problems.  That seems illogical itself!

RATING: 5
It is a very simple game of outguess your pursuers/prey but it is very well done.  The mix of different movement techniques, special tickets, and timed reveals make a very elegant package.  It's not really for me though, I just don't find myself having too much fun either chasing a phantom or outrunning my would-be captors.

Good deduction game, that only works well with four detectives. With less, Mr. X doesn't stand a chance; with more, the detectives' task is hopeless.

Now here is a game with some nostalgic value!  And having played it a few times this year for the first time in years, I have discovered that it still maintains that sense of tension and fun which I recall from my childhood.  The game is very easy to learn (so much so that it could make an ideal gateway game for non-gamers), plays relatively quickly, and has a fun co-operative element for the detective players (although playing Mr. X is the most fun!).  The production value is quite basic (it's an old game, and I'm a little partial to the old colour scheme) but functional.  "Fury of Dracula" is clearly a much longer, much more complex, and more fun spin-off of this game, but if you don't have the time or brain energy for that one (and if you find it for a couple of dollars in a thrift shop as my wife did!), "Scotland Yard" is a great alternative.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

This game is so much fun to play as a kid.  I have played many games and my family has played this game hundreds of times.  This game can be played with 2-6 players.

1 player is Mr X (the criminal) and the other player(s) play the 5 detectives that are trying to track Mr X by using different forms of transportation (Taxi, Bus, Underground).  Each transportation type is limited, so you must use them wisely.

The game takes about 1 hr to play and is really fun.  I highly recommend the game for the game play and the theme.

I enjoyed this one a lot as a kid.  This game got me hooked on "hidden movement" types of games.  There is a lot of suspense for both the detectives, as you chase Mr. X around the board, and for the Mr. X player, as you narrowly escape capture.  The board itself is also very cool.  I will find myself just looking it over and finding landmarks I have visited in my travels to London.  Great game.

[Ravensburger International Edition] {Agent; devil vs angel, deduction} Scotland Yard is a good family deduction game. It is thematic, easy to learn and fun to play. It facilitates cooperative and communication.  In addition, it provides both tactical and strategic moves. Recommended!

Being Mr. X is very exciting. It needs smart bluffing and courage to avoid being kept!

The components can be nicer.  The Hat is handy but it's not effective to hide the viewpoint of Mr. X, even though it can cover a player's eyes.  The transportation tile is average. The travel log is handy and nice.   The board is too busy to read.  It is not easy to find the starting location.

I have fond memories of playing this game when it first came out in the early 80s. Mr X tries to escape from the other players by travelling from place to place on a map of London.  Every few turns he must reveal his location but usually he only needs to reveal what form of transportation he has taken.  If he can evade capture for a set number of turns then he wins, otherwise the detectives win.  It's a simple game and the odds are rather stacked against Mr. X but it's a lot of fun.

The downfall of this game is unless people stand up for themselves, one of the detectives ends up running the entire hunt, the others just listen to what he/she says. Makes a good 2 player game, but often it ends up only being a 2 player game as all the other players are just puppets.

I think the way this falls flat is that the investigators don't necessarily find it as fun as the guy being chased.

Hell of a game!! For 2 players it's like a chess of the new century, like a boardgame duell of deduction. Its very tiring however and might be boring for someone who cant find mister X for a long time.

I had forgotten about Scotland Yard.  I played it when I was young, but ignored it for over a decade.  Returning to it, I've found that it really holds up for adults.  Unfortunately many players find it stressful to play Mr. X.  A five-on-one game is tough.  Definately a game in a class by itself in many ways.  The mechanics are well tied to the theme, but rules remain simple and the gameplay is great.

RATING: 7.4
Maybe it should be higher than this.  Hard decision.  It's a great example of the "Everyone team up and hunt for one other person" genre.  When I was younger, playing with friends, Mr. X would almost always win.  However, with age comes (some) wisdom, and in my recent game groups we have never seen Mr. X win, and essentially score by how long he goes before a capture.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.45
As with many co-ops, you have to be careful that one player doesn’t take over, directing all the others (I can be guilty (/and the victim) of this!). 

Love that it’s London, and I love how tense it can be as Mr X when you feel everyone ganging up on you!

RATING: 7
Played it two player, where I was the detective.  My wife did not like playing all the detectives, nor would she like the tension of playing the fugitive, she said.  I thoroughly enjoyed being the fugitive and would play this again. It requires a lot of creativity on the part of the fugitive, and a lot of psychology on the part of the detectives.  My wife, in thinking aloud, was pretty much accurate when she speculated where I was. LOL!

This is a pretty good game, but it suffers from a few problems due to it's many vs. one nature.  The detectives have to work together to box in Mr. X, but in practice, it's really 1 on 1 with some detectives simply carrying out the biddings of another player.

RATING: 7
Co-op game that often devolves into one player telling the others what to do.  You can't house rule this to make everybody make their own decisions otherwise the bad guy always gets away...so your fun is usually dependent upon your groups ability to play well together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The map is great, the pieces are terrific, and the Mr. X tracking system is brilliant.  The only problem with Scotland Yard is that one player is isolated while the rest of the players gang-up against them.  This dynamic flourishes in some gaming groups but it doesn't work in my family.

This should be a 2 player game, however I'm willing to play it vs friends who coop well.

Although, I think Mr. Jack is a vastly superior game with the same flavor.

Excellent game of it's type and a very good game over all.

I have always had fun with this.  Good for gamers and non-gamers and scales very well from 2-6.  I would recommend it over Great Museum Caper. 

I have never played Fury of Dracula or Garibaldi so I can't compare.

Update:  Still an 8.  As I wrote for Great Museum Caper, the problem it has is that it is more fun to be the prey.

Update: I have now played Letters from Whitechapel. Did it kill Scotland Yard? No way. I can see that LfW has more meat and tension, but it takes much longer to play and the theme is not universally appropriate. 

If I had to keep just one forever it would probably be SY just because it is easier to get played. If I wanted a tense, 2 player, 3-hour game of cat-and-mouse on a rainy Sunday afternoon you better believe it would be Letters from Whitechapel.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

Pretty fun concept but there just isn't much meat on this game. The deduction is always gonna be incomplete with this one (it has to be otherwise mr. x has no chance), it basically comes down to a guessing game of which path mr x chooses, and there isn't much of a tell to go on. Yeah you get to see method of transportation but every method has multiple options and don't forget the hidden tickets to mess this up even further. Very little strategy and very little actual deduction, but it's not the worst game for sure.

Great game, always was one that the whole family enjoyed playing. Also can be played with two players, which makes for a much more intense session. It can be difficult for the good guys to win if the detectives don't cooperate, and if you're doing a two-player version, the amount of thought that must go into  winning as the detectives and trapping Mr. X makes for a pretty heavy game.

Still a ton of fun, though.

While fairly well received by my non-gamer family, I was not as impressed as I'd hoped. I think I would rather invest in getting to know Fury of Dracula for this type of game. Scotland Yard seemed to have less fun and immersion, although it is certainly easier to learn.

2011-May 11th: Given away. I have Fury of Dracula, Letters from Whitechapel, Nuns on the Run, and perhaps a few others that provide a similar experience, all of which I prefer to this one.

One of the players takes on the role of Mr. X. His job is to move from point to point around the map of London taking taxis, buses or subways. The detectives, the remaining players acting in concert, move around similarly in an effort to move into the same space as Mr. X. But while the criminal's mode of transportation is nearly always known, his exact location is only known intermittently throughout the game.

This is a good game with deductive reasoning. It can be played both with less serious gamers and ones thinking their hardest and trying to coordinate everything in the hunt for Mr. X. Recommend against playing with people on both extremes at the same time (the strategists getting mad at the more lighthearted players). 
People disagree about who the game is weighted in favor of (Mr. X or Scotland Yard) -- I would personally believe is a matter of how serious and well-coordinated Scotland Yard is.

I played a ton of Scotland Yard in my childhood and have just recently given it another try. It still holds up rather well. It's a great, innovative system, and there are some great strategic and tactical decisions to make for both sides. I think the perfect number of players is 4. More than that and the detectives either won't be able to form cohesive plans, or some will get mostly left out of the process. Fewer than that, and you lose the group planning dynamic and the game becomes much drier.

A good, old-fashioned fox hunt. It combines co-op play with an intelligent adversary.

The elusive Mister X must resurface every few rounds, giving his pursuers a brief window of opportunity to entrap him. 

I remember playing this as a child, and having the worst poker face as Mister X.

Fun as light game.  Opinions on balance seem to vary widely.  My preferred method?  Two players, four detectives, and a chess clock set to fifteen minutes for Mr. X and fifteen minutes for the combined forces of the detectives.  Mr. X isn't put under much time pressure, but the detective player has to balance deduction against the clock.  Tense feeling really adds to the police-chase theme.

A fun semi-cooperative game where where one player (Mr. or Mrs. X) tries to evade the other players (the detectives). The playing of this game (and not necessarily its outcome) is where the fun is. The teamwork and discussion that this game initiates for the detectives and the nail-biting tension of Mr. X hoping not to be found are tangible. Great change of pace from many other deduction games. Lots of fun with the family.

My wife and I love playing this when we get the chance.  We've played with 4 and 6 player groups, I feel that 3 players can be done but may lose the dynamic that a larger group has to offer.  It's a great challenge to play as or against Mr. X.  Usually longer games are played when an experienced person plays as X.

A great deduction game with all the players chasing Mr. X based on limited knowledge of his transportation methods. Unfortunately, in large groups this game generally evolves into one player taking over a discussion. Playing with 3 people seems to work - 1 Mr. X and 2 detectives discussing the strategy without anyone's opinion getting ignored. I imagine 1v1 would work great too.

One of the players takes on the role of Mr. X. His job is to move from point to point around the map of London taking taxis, buses or subways. The detectives, the remaining players acting in concert, move around similarly in an effort to move into the same space as Mr. X. But while the criminal's mode of transportation is nearly always known, his exact location is only known intermittently throughout the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An old game but a good one.  Playing the elusive Mr X makes your Adrenelin build as the detectives close in on you.  Also, it%u2019s very satisfying when you slip through the dragnet as they are trying to close in on your location.  Budget your double moves and hidden moves wisely as you will need to use every trick to try to escape the clever detectives.  Also a nice change where other players work as a team to work against one player.

A lot of good tension in here, especially for a short, quick-playing game. I do wish that they included a minimap for Mr. X (my wife is very good at tracking my eyes), and the version I have also makes it difficult to write clandestinely (I resort to making 3 strokes every time, even if I'm only in one space), but overall there are a lot of interesting decisions on both sides here.

A mystery game that works. Both Mr. X and the detectives HAVE to use logic to try and outsmart the other.

I love this game. A great cooperative family game. Usually the good guys win but every once in a while the bad guy gets away.

Game is a bit long for what it does. Strategy for Mr X is to stick with taxi travel, black tickets and double moves, thus maximizing the location possibility tree. Game is fun for Mr X but is lacking for the detectives. Given that there are more detectives than Mr X, this makes for a one-sided Gaming experience.

Ich finde leider, dass dieses Spiel trotz seines Ko-op Charakters viel zu wenig zur Kommunikation untereinander anregt. Gerade was das eigene Bewegen angeht. Gerade in einer kleineren Spielgruppe wird das Spiel schnell frustrierend, da es hier nahezu unmöglich wird Mr. X zu fangen.

I never really liked this game. It is way too hard to catch the thief and I feel this game does not give the police officers anything interesting to do.

Even the GF has played this, always as The Ripper, never beaten.
The simple rules allow players to immerse themselves in a pure hunt for the spring-heeled fiend, formulating ever-adapting plans to cage the elusive villain.
Seems to play best with 4 peelers versus Jack, but that could be because he's a criminal genius. Muhahahahahah!

I even collected together a set of painted peelers, Holmes and Watson, and I also have Jack the Ripper! I just wanted to change the flavour to a hunt for the world's most famous serial killer, through fog-shrouded London.

A solid game that goes well with nongamers. Good game to play with family and friends. Most fun with 4 detectives.

Very neat chase game.  We've just recently acquired this one, so rating may go up or down with more playings.  Update: not as replayable as I thought it would be.  It's OK, but not one that I really have any desire to play.

You need a poker faced shifty eyed Mister X or it's way too easy!

Scotland Yard is long and tedious, but it's a classic.

A classic! But this is the modern dark map version, would like to trade for the old bright version!

This game is really a two player game, masquerading as a multi-player game.

A lighter 'earlier' version of The Fury of Dracula.

This takes away all the combat charts, counters, chit pulling etc, from the aforementioned game, but retains all the suspense & adds more fun.

superseded by Garibaldi.

Nice little cat & mouse game. Nowhere near as thematic or streamlined as Letters from Whitechapel.

Great board, fun hidden movement game (lots more fun to be Mr. X though)

This was a charity shop find cost R30 around $2.50 and it looks good,and we had loads of fun playing it. I lost my first game on round 2

The Mr.X cap alone is worth a 8 :) Seriously, cool game, one of the first popular cooperative games. You can add some strategy if you use some of the rules from N.Y. Chase (Helicopter and roadblocks).

В игру приятно играть, но в ней ничего нет, кроме поиска одного игрока другими - в этом смысле Fury of Dracula выигрывает.

Excellent game with 6 or 7 players.  Loses its interest if not enough agents are chasing Mr. X.

I played this when I was a kid. It's alright, but it's another game which I don't have any strong desire to play again.

Fury of Dracula seems to do the same thing better.

Chasing Mr X was fun. Today, I would much prefer games, which create more interesting table talk (either cooperatively or in negotiation).

Ein weiteres Kinderspiel von mir. Ich mochte es immer gerne, auch wenn ich leider selten genug Mitspieler hatte. Zu zweit ist es ziemlich ermüdend, wenn einer alleine drei Detektive spielen muss. Aber zu dritt oder viert kann man es schon mal auspacken.

RATING: 6
Still holds up as an interesting game for the occasional games day, but I can take it or leave it, honestly.  I  think Mr X. Has a big advantage over the detectives.  Guesswork and intuition play as much a role as logic and strategy.

RATING: 9
My favorite way to play this is two-player, with one player (usually me) managing all of the detectives.  Love it!  I greatly enjoy trying to create and tighten the net around Mister X.

Not very good to be an officer. You just don't have any decision to make, the group chooses instead of you.

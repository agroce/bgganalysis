I want to like it more than I do.
A game that seems to reward many multiple plays in teaching how to play it. Not something that I like in this case as it seems quite frustrating while you are on the learning curve.

Hmmmm... No, still don't like it.

More or less a rethemed Dominion. Looks better, feels slightly better. Might have some glaring flaws in the rules/cards, need to check. Still don't understand the love for deckbuilders. Many inherent flaws in the game type, like noninteraction, endless shuffling and counting, extremely easy cheating...

RATING: 5
It's okay, but I find that there are a lot of imbalances in the card values, and if you have bad luck in the draws and miss out on the better cards, you are completely screwed.  The strength of the starting monsters really dictates the pace of the game.  My biggest complaint, why the hell does every single card have the same back?  including the dividers and XP cards!

120909 Why not just play dominion instead?  I think Deck building is also a mechanic that doesn't do it for me.  So unfortunately its rated low.  However I see how it is a nicely made Deck building game, albeit with too many fucking numbers.

I have been tiring of Dominion and picked this up as an alternative deck-builder game.  The solo variant was a huge plus for me.  So far I've played about 5 solo games and one 3-player game.  The solo game is well done and very enjoyable.  It seems the multi-player variants will be a lot o fun as well, but I should mention that the other players in my three-player game were familiar with Dominion and didn't take to this as quickly as I'd hoped.

After several more solo plays I'm upgrading this from an 8 to a 9.  I have been playing a lot of board games solo lately (Ravenloft, DungeonQuest, Runebound, Death Angel, Agricola, Arkham Horror, Ascension, etc), many of which have been fun.  Thunderstone provides the best solo experience by far, however.  In most of the other games I'm left feeling like it would be a lot more fun with someone else, but this doesn't happen with TS...it just works and is incredibly fun and challenging.

The one caveat to my rating is that I suspect I won't actually enjoy playing it with other people as much as I do solo, and might only rate a 7 or 8 over the long term as a multi-player game.

Dont get as much face to face games as I would like so have been playing quite a few multiplayer games that can be played solo by taking on multiple characters. Thunderstone probably the easiest of these to manage. Have one expansion. Will probably try and add slowly to these as I enjoy the system and once you get over the light penalties it is fairly clear.

RATING: 5
Comparison with Dominion cannot be avoided. Thunderstone is essentially the very same game except for the fact that where in Dominion you only have one currency, Thunderstone boasts three. One for buying things in the village and two for buying victory points. I find this an unnecessary complication to a game in which the most interesting part is the analysis of the setup (=choosing strategy). The tactical phase in a game like this should play fast so that you can see whether your analysis was correct or not, but I find Thunderstone a bit too long. You have too many monsters to defeat before the game ends. Furthermore, the game includes a transition from village deck to dungeon deck (i.e. from one currency to another) which makes the game drag.

Thunderstone is not a bad game but Dominion is more elegant, for it plays faster and has fewer rule breaking exceptions while still manages to offer the same joy of analysing the setup, devising a strategy and executing it.

(S) Fantasy Deck builder. Expansions tend to weigh it down and make it less accessable. Haven't played it much since I combined everything together for Super-Thunderstone.

RATING: 4
Tried this twice and both times left unsatisfied after playing. Perhaps I've not developed any good strategies but have found that the game degenerates quickly to just drawing cards until you get a hand that can defeat a monster after buying/upgrading a few heroes and getting some weapons. The lack of extra "actions/buys/cards" means it's too easy to determine if you can't kill a monster to just rest/visit the village instead. Don't see the expansion solving these issues much.

This is great fun. A comparison to Dominion is inevitable.

Here are the differences:
-theme
-balancing 2 resources (attack/light and gold)
-Monsters vs victory cards handled a little differently. The way Thunderstone does it adds a luck factor.
-Dominion has more ways in the form of action to mitigate the luck (although it's always there). 
-Related to above: Thunderstone you are mostly stuck with what you have, which actually makes turns quicker because thinking can be done beforehand

I can see these differences mattering to some people. To me it just makes it a little different. I think if you made the themes for both games match then you're left with games that you can hardly distinguish, so I'm not sure that this game differentiates itself from Dominion enough for me to want to get it. Perhaps with expansions that's another story...

Played four and five-player. There's a great of redundancy here, infecting different areas of the game. I'm surprised this was allowed, or wasn't recognised, by those responsible. This means you often can't use whats present. The numerous ruleset revisions are not encouraging. and put a question-mark against the conceptual production process, not to mention any "testing". It gets boring fast, as the only theme here seems to be whether you put a big toe, a foot or both feet round the corner of the dungeon entrance -- Dominion may not have a theme but it isn't quite so thematically limited. The game drags and I was thinking "this is crap" whilst waiting for my turn. I'm unconvinced that a "small deck" strategy is possible, since there's a great deal of lead time before a six-card hand from your deck can kill a monster, and a longer period prior to the emergence of the most powerful heroes.

The basic ideas are good and workable, so a little more know-how next time.

I quite like this variation on Dominion, it feels like the dungeon crawler theme and gameplay is a bit longer so more emphasis on getting your deck how you need it. The card draw seems a bit more pronounced than Dominion though. Happy to play every now and then with up to 4 players and I would be interested in trying some of the expansions as I haven't played it much since they started bulldozing them out, must be like 5 expansions to this already.

To be fair, I only played it once and didn't finish the game.  It felt like an endless series of drafting with the too frequent addition of not having ANY good play.

I don't like card drafting games, so maybe it is no surprise that I didn't like this one.  People kept comparing this to Dominion (which I like better, but alas, will never be a favorite).

People who like drafting games may enjoy it, but I think I will pass on playing it again.

A poor Dominion clone.  Deck-building to reach a threshold (defeat monsters for EXP and VP).  Positive reinforcement in that defeating monsters yields EXP which results in efficient upgrading of heroes and a stronger deck to more easily defeat monsters.

Negative reinforcement in that failing to meet a threshold is really, [i]really[/i] painful.  I've had games where, due to the draw or other players taking the easy ones, I just couldn't reach a threshold to take out more than 1 or 2 monsters.

In Dominion, the thresholds are obvious and the cards interact nicely to provide a number of different options.  Here, there are so many fewer choices and very few strategies available.

In Dominion, more VP cards bought means a tougher deck to play as they clog up the works.  Here, some of the VP cards have additional benefits that help you.  They're not that imposing at all.

Artwork needs improvement.  Not enough differentiation in symbols.  Theme is excellent.  Replay value is high-ish.

Honestly, there's no reason to play this over Dominion other than theme.  I don't like this one and it's a tough sell to convince me to play it.  Not for me at all, which is a shame 'cause I love the theme.

I'd rather play this than Dominion, but Ascension is my favourite deckbuilder. 

It's still just about identifying the best 'combo' then racing other players. It's more fun because of the theme, but until you understand how the monsters work it's terribly random.

[With Wrath of the Elements]

The monster luck makes this not really that much worth playing, I think.  It's not a _terrible_ game, but it goes on a good bit longer than it should, without enough interest past the early mid-game to hold you.  It's also (1) solitaire and (2) over-luck-driven.  The larger decks and more need for "multi-card combos" than in a certain other game make for higher variance in a bad sense, as well.

In short, I'm a guy so I'm not immune to the theme ("Whoa, my guys can KILL ANYTHING") but I'm with Mrs. alexd in wondering why not just play that other game.  Which we didn't even like at first!

RATING: 5
Good game, nice theme and variety, mechanics work well. But
* Runs a bit too long.
* 3 points for being lucky enough to get the Thunderstone seems unfair.
* The order the monsters come out can make quite a difference - some players may get good monsters while the others get bad monsters.
* Should not be played with five people.

RATING: 5.5
Like all deck building games. It's a slow start. It's even slower if the first 3 monsters are 'large'. 

The initial buys on the available village cards will determine what are the monsters you can defeat. Which eventually account for your winning in the game. 

Like most deck building games. There is minimal interaction between players. The meta game is near the end where your characters starts to be more powerful and killing monsters become easier. 

Graphics are great. Game play seem novel at first but it actually bogs the game down a few more turns especially with the 'light' component. 

Minimal entertaining value to me.

My first time playing a card builder game. Instantly I was addicted to the "shopping" aspect of this game as I was transported to midievil ebay of potions, great axes, and mercs for hire.

I guess everyone is going to have their favorite deck building game. This one is mine. Is it the greatest game in the world? No. But it is pretty quick to play, offers plenty of variety and paths to victory while still offering the players plenty of tough choices. I find the option to have something to use your deck on (the monsters) really adds to the appeal for me. Some of those monsters are REAL tough. The combination of heroes, monsters and village cards adds plenty of variety. Some village cards are pretty good but are tempered to some extent by the heroes and monsters that are in play. Just having the best cards in your deck will not win you the game usually. You have to know how to best utilize the cards available to you. I think that this aspect makes the game more replayable.      I love the variety that the expansions add to the game. There are lots of very interesting heroes and village cards along with plenty of very cool monsters. A very solid game. Also, AEG has done a great job helping players store all the cards that come in the different expansions. It's great that I can store the base game, promos and three expansions in a relatively small box and still have room for more cards. All the cards are also very nicely organized to make set-up and tear down go quickly so you have more time to play. Hats off to AEG for that.

* just like in MtG you are supposed to compile an "optimal" deck, only here you have to do it on the fly, which means it's harder for you to estimate probabilities of getting given card, plus you need to memorize which cards are still there in your deck and how many of each. 
* monster cards going into your deck are not helping at all with problem no.1
* gameplay is mostly tedious math calculations at all times (instead of dungeon crawling fun).
* apart from rogue hero sometimes discarding your opponent's cards there is literally no player interaction in the whole game. 
* constant deck shuffling takes as much time as the rest of the game.
* i didn't get it why you can't level up while resting (seems pretty obvious). getting rid of cards using draw-and-discard mechanic is a torture. 
* plenty of annoying card texts ("eliminate this-that").
* winning points system doesn't go hand in hand with dungeon crawl setting at all. final count is pretty anti-climactic. 
* time consuming setup (and sorting out messed up pile of 500 cards [if you or some other guy was not careful] can take up to an hour).
* rules are pretty badly organized. 
(в общем, понимаю, почему для игры в какой-то момент переписали правила [см. Thunderstone Advanced {нет на русском}])

I had no fun at all when playing it. I though the turns would be straight and fast but there's a hell of stats to keep track of and it can also drag a bit.
At the end of the game I felt like Bill Murray in Groundhog's Day.

I enjoy this more than DOMINION, as the core mechanic and the theme mesh well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The game has a much stronger theme and a more interesting scoring method than its predecessor.  Because you have to choose between preparing for battle or actually battling on every turn, you must balance your deck between being strong at deckbuilding and being strong at scoring points.  The abilities of the cards are probably about as varied as the core Dominion's mix of cards, but knowing how much preparation you need before going into battle is thematically fun and strategically interesting.

Now for the part of the comment where I whine.  Parts of the game seem unpolished. Several times during our inaugural Thunderstone session, my fellow players and I just asked each other "Why is this card worded like this?" or "How is that supposed to be a balanced card?" (though we haven't played much, so this one is just a n00b's opinion). Unless my group just evaluates cards and wording differently from most people, these seem like avoidable problems.

The other problem I have with Thunderstone is the cards themselves.  First, why XP cards? They don't add anything, and I would rather just have cardboard chips.  Second, although the art is pretty good, the cards themselves are rather poor quality (many stacks were starting to warp as soon as we took the plastic off!).  If you're going to sell a card game as a big-box game with a big-box price, I'd appreciate it if you at least made sure the cards were high-quality.

I love the theme, I love the dungeon/village division, and judging on core mechanics, I'd call this game Dominion's equal.  With some higher production values and some minor tweaks for balance and wording, I would probably rate this game a 9.

Dominion the Dungeon Crawl brings a bit more theme to the card-shuffling action.  Where Thunderstone suffers in comparison to Dominion is in a lack of interesting decisions.  It's your turn; do your six cards have the attack value to kill a monster and earn v.p.s?  If so, do it.  If not, go to the village and buy something you are short of (effectively heroes, weapons, money or light sources).  Rinse and repeat for much, much longer than a game of Dominion.

The cards are quite well made, though the artwork struck me as sub-par and some of the monster names were laughable - anyone for Jelly?  The box insert was clearly designed with another game in mind.

Cool deck building game with a nice high fantasy theme. Players buy heroes, equip them with powerfull weapons and or spells and then sent them into the nasty dark dungeon to kill monsters and get VP.

An interesting, quick game, and similar in many respects to Dominion.  Ultimately, luck holds this game back from being great, as is the case (naturally) with many card games.

Update after further play:
The game starts to feel repetitive after a while.  This game felt much like Stone Age, insofar as I was initially very hooked but grew tired of the game after extended plays.

UPDATE after further further play: I have grown fonder of Thunderstone lately.  Oddly enough, this turned out to be the case with Stone Age, too.  Thunderstone, with expansions, offers a nice variety, and, for me, it's more engaging than, say, Dominion.

All it took was a single 2 hour game and we knew how to play. Easy to learn for beginners and lots of fun. When it comes to games (any game not just card games) my wife and I tend to compare our enjoyment to that of Magic The Gathering. That is because it (Magic The Gathering) is an easy to learn, easy to play game that just works. This is the same thing. It just works. The mechanics are fantastic, the card art is great, the feel of the game is great and the production values are spot on. 

The game would get a 10 if it had some interaction between players, as it is right now the game feels like a 2 player game of (single player) solitaire. But it is a game where you can sit at the table, have a laugh, talk about your day, have a few drinks and relax. Well worth getting.

Edit: Score is 9 now due to solo play being just as great as when you play with other folks. Really well thought out game.

Rips off Dominion heavily, but adds an aspect of recruiting heroes to fight monsters which in turn serves as the most effective way to get victory points. It lacks the depth of Dominion yet adds more flavor for fantasy fans to enjoy. Overall it's a fun game to play. I think Dominion is the better game, but Thunderstone copies enough of the good parts while adding it's own unique qualities to make me a fan.

Of course it is heavily influenced by Dominion, but doesn't try to hide it.
What it does on top of Dominion in my opinion:
- great theme
- cards do things you can relate to
- more decisions on top of which cards to buy

RATING: 7
I love the elegance and the "dig your own grave" aspect of deck building. Thunderstone is such a fun theme. I'd love to get this more on the table, but the husband is not as big of a fan. Games feel a little bit too long, even with the two player variant and using a non-random town generator. 

Still need to try to get Epic Thunderstone on the table....but then there's truly no going back.

On the fence so far.  I think I like the game, but there are a bunch of mechanics that really felt weird.  You have to think about so much when you walk into the dungeon - weight, strength, light, weapons, attacks, bonuses, penalities, etc.  It doesn't feel nearly as smooth as Dominion (and yes, the comparison DOES have to be made).  It's a different experience, and I want to play again.  My wife hates it, so I doubt it will ever end up in our collection.

All it took was one game and I knew that this was going to be much better than Dominion. Yes, it clearly took all that is good about Dominion, but then continued to fix a lot that is undesirable about Dominion. 

Got very tired of the degree of calculating that is required in this game versus its predecessor and contemporaries. Too bad as I enjoyed the theme and concept of this game much more than Dominion and Ascension.

RATING: 6
More theme than Dominion, but not as solidly built.  Felt like it suffered from lack of playtesting and development time.  Would rather see tokens for XP than cards.  Will be a hit for those that prefer dungeon crawls over euros.  On the other hand I traded a copy of TransEuropa for this, so that feels about right.

A bit like Dominion but with noticeable differences, especially with having to choose where to go each turn.
I think it's likely to be harder to pick up initially because there's more iconography on the cards but still seems easy enough to follow after a game.

RATING: 6
I prefer this over Dominion, in spite of it not quite being as sparkling of a game design under the hood...see Dominion comment for why.

Further, I think Thunderstone can draw comparisons to Munchkin, in ways that Dominion cannot.  Munchkin, in spite of some major gaming design shortcomings, can be a really good game for particular groups.  I think Thunderstone can be a much better game for those same groups, and is a viable alternative to Munchkin, where Dominion is not.

Very nice deck-building game (great artwork!) and a bit more goal oriented than Dominion (due to the monsters of the dungeon to kill). The randomness is kept to a minimum with the random order of the monsters coming out of the dungeon. Receiving XP and using it to level up your heroes - it provides it with something special. :) Love the theme and nice fun even that there is still too little interaction between the players.

Great fantasy themed deck builder. Love to play it, hate to set it up. Need to try other variants to try and reduce these issues. There are also many balance issues but considering the amount of content that is available for this game you can easily remove the biggest offenders. Cool design but there are some elements that could have been streamlined. (Attack and Magic attack could have just been one thing. I know thematically many would not like that, but this game could of tightened up monster and hero design to make this a non issue.)

Played first game last night with two people.

Easy enough game once you've gone through your first couple of rounds together. The instructions are a tad confusing right off the go for your first time and may benefit from a 'your first game' sheet that is separate from the rest of the book so that you can avoid the discussion about the randomizers for your first game. A few more illustrations might help for newer gamers too.

I'm not a fan of Dominion, but I can appreciate it's very elegant mechanics, and why they hold so dear to that many people. Dominion is a very well designed, elegant game with a laughably silly theme (and rather bad artwork).

Enter Thunderstone. I had great expectations about this one. The theme made sense, and the fact you're fighting monsters made for a much more compelling hype. Sadly, this all comes at the cost of the mechanics' elegance. The game is just not fun for me, and it becomes really fiddly. Plus, the extra layers make for a much more chaotic game, but with pretensions of being a gamers' game.

I might play again, but I'm not actively seeking to. That makes it a 4 (at best) in my book.

RATING: 5
A derivative of Dominion.  Much clunkier and slower than D with a less engaging theme.  Had Dominion not existed, its design would have impressed more.

It just isn't my cup of tea clearly.Deck-building where playing solo or with others doesn't feel any different. Ok some cards will not be taken by others in solo, you'll have to deal with more monsters and you probably wont be adding up points at the end if you survive, but other than that feels quite empty.

RATING: 5
1st play impression 4P: 90m: Initial Rating 5: card drafting fantasy card game with some similar mechanics to Dominion. Collect and use hero, weapons, artifacts etc to capture monsters (vp). Slightly more complicated and appears much longer to play than Dominion which I strongly prefer.  Also potentially frustrating if the bigger monsters come out early when no one has a strong enough hand of cards to capture them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After an initial burst of excitement, my rating has dropped to the current level. Too fiddly, needs a few too many house rules. Good idea, not quite developed. However, my rating with the first expansion is a 7, so I'm willing to trade for it...

Mechanic-wise it's nothing new as it's a straight Dominion clone with deckbuiling as a backbone. What this excels at is the theme. The game is much more thematic than Dominion, e.g. it make sense that in order to fight with more powerful monsters you need to buy a proper sword instead of the dagger you start with.

Once you get over the fact that this is NOT a fantasy themed Dominion, the game is really good.

Also, play with random sets as quickly as possible - the suggested starter set is not the most exciting . . .

While it lacks innovation (the deck-building mechanic is what made Dominion what it is), it's indeed a good twist on the genre, with more theme and some more variability. Maybe is a little less elegant than Dominion in design, but probably different enough to have both in one's collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
EDIT: comments below still valid, this is painfully random but more thematic dominion. but if you know what you are getting into and not expect dominion-like game too much it is fun all the same.

--

if you are a story-first kind of gamer this might appeal to you, it's hard not to respect what the author has done in this respect.

as a game, for me at least, this will not see any play.

- the game is a LOT more random than Dominion. imagine playing D but some cards allow you to buy victory points, and others action cards. how they split is suddenly a lot more important. not to mention the monsters - who cares you got 8gold, that province card is just not there at this time, buy an estate.

- the game has a very big snowball. you can find yourself out of the game rather quickly if you are unlucky enough not to get to the hero upgrades.

- the game is 2-3 times longer than dominion, and if you are at the wrong end of the snowball effect that means an hour of waiting for the obvious end.

so to me, not caring for the story aspect, this is a straight down worse variant of D.

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: This deckbuilder tells a nice dungeon crawl story. Build a party of heroes. Equip them with torches, rations, weapons, and spells. Enter the dungeon. Go back to the town for rest, more equipment, and more/better personnel. The mechanism that stood out to me the most was the option to upgrade heroes using XPs, as well as the need for light sources in order to delve deeper into the dungeon. Add to that the fact that the slain monsters will cycle gold into your hand frequently makes this a deckbuilder with theme. The only detraction from theme for me was slaying many monsters increases the bloat of your deck and actually makes it more difficult to continue slaying monsters. Overall, the game was enjoyable but still suffered from what many early deckbuilders did, the feeling of multiplayer solitaire.

If you like Dominion give this a try, if you don't give it a try. The two are similar enough I believe a Dominion player could, in the least, tolerate a game in place of Dominion, and different enough someone who doesn't enjoy Dominion might like it. The downside to the game is the game can't (from my understanding) bring itself to an end like Dominion. No one is picking up victory point cards? No problem. In Thunderstone, if no one is fighting monsters the game will drag. This could be a terrible blow for someone new to deck-builders who probably doesn't yet understand refining a deck.

Unfortunately Thunderstone is only a copy of 'Dominion' and it is less elegant in game design than it's predecessor. The calculations and the setup are too fiddly and the game itself has a higher luck factor than Dominion, and, let's face it, even less player interaction. The only plus for Thunderstone is 'more theme' but this wears off quickly.

I don't understand why this has a strong following as it feels like a step back from Dominion in every way. Luck in the monster deck is the biggest issue - if the big guns are killed without you getting a turn with them on the table, you'll lose. The decision-making becomes trivial too quickly too; kill the biggest scoring monster each turn.

Not as good as Dominion, but not worse either. The problem with the game is that it is heavily themed game (fantasy theme) and it is not that appealing to the wider audience. I had some trouble convincing Agnes to play the game, but saying that it is same as Dominion convinced her. The game has some other minor problems as well, like the player interaction. We played the game in total silence - that was kinda boring. And the first 15 minutes the symbols on the cards doesn't make sense, but later on, it doesn't bother anymore.
I really like this game, but somehow the cards should have little bit more interaction between players to make it more interesting game.
I say this though - I will buy all the expansions! :D

Rating after just 2 games. Thunderstone is an interesting games, with great tactical variety game after game thanks to the different hero/monster/items avalaible.
All players have the same resources, and some kind of strategy is possible. Need to figure well how this works, until now I have just seen the "item heavy" and the "hero fast development" pattern.
Of course all this depends by avalaible cards.
The game is less luck dependant than other card games.

This was a very fun game where you build your deck by buying cards to put in it. You want to get vp's by defeating monsters. Sounds familiar? Indeed it's just Dominion with a Fantasy sauce poured over it. Admittedly there are some differences. In Thunderstone you basically have two currencies instead of one, you can level up characters (cards) by using xp and there is a fun light mechanic going on. But it still feels just like Dominion. It seems to me like this game was designed to capitalize on the succes of Dominion. Not a very gentleman way to behave. Still, if you like Dominion and you like fantasy themed games, you'll love Thunderstone.

2 rating points deducted for this less than original game.

The game has a lot of little rules, but they all make sense in respect to the theme.

Played a 5 player game.  I think that made the game a bit cut throat.  There were some cards that ran out.  Everyone enjoyed it and said they'd play it again.

Played a 2 player game.  The game seemed to go on forever.  I'll have to variant this by placing the Thunderstone higher within the dungeon deck.

Played a 4 player game.  This maybe the sweet spot.  It did seem necessary to have some village card that allowed 'destroy'.  It seemed to keep the decks within a manageable level.

RATING: 8
Given the close resemblance between them both, and not only due to their appearance, a comparision between Thunderstone and Dominion is unavoidable: surely the former is a rip-off of the latter and somehow plays in a fiddlier way than Dominion.

Yet Thunderstone is also a much more thematic and rewarding, thus more gratifying, deckbuilder than Dominion: actually there isn’t just mechanics to be mastered as in Dominion but a tale to be told.

And explaining what each of your six cards does when you’re delving into the dungeon makes undoubtedly for a better game experience than just playing them because they’re the best-scoring you have drawn.

After two plays, I can see many of the criticisms of this game. Yes, the dungeon can easily throw up monsters nobody can kill, and this can seriously slow the game down. The rules are also completely lacking when it comes to the difficult job of explaining card effect interactions. Do monsters kill heroes after the attack strength is worked out, or before it? Can you kill a hero borrowed by the level 3 magician's power? The rules are infuriatingly unclear.

I also found it particularly susceptible to AP as players struggled with different battle modifiers (addition and multiplication) for two different types of attack (basic and magic) and light. I would advise against four or five players, there's just too much downtime.

Ultimately, while I really like the central mechanic, the game seems to be a pile of mechanics that just don't work well together, causing a game of many fits and starts. Our group suggests the following houserules to make the game more fluid:

- PROGRESSIVE DUNGEON DECK - the game needs this like nothing else.

- allow immediate spend of XP gained in a battle, after that battle on heroes who took part in the battle, augmented by collected XP if needed.

- Disallow the spending of money on Lvl 2 and Lvl 3 heroes - they can only be purchased through XP.

- Instead of destroying heroes after upgrading, replace them on top of the hero deck.

I had a really long review for this game because it fell into that extremely frustrating niche of a great idea hampered by execution.

I think the wholesale appropriation of Dominion mechanics really works for the theme.  But the pacing of the game is completely mangled.  The first part of the game you build your deck and the second you mow down monsters.  There should be more of a choice between the options, but killing monsters is almost always a bad idea early.  This error is particularly egregious because neither killing monsters or buying stuff is particularly engaging or interesting.  Playing your hand in Dominion could become rote once you were experienced, but it certainly has more depth than in Thunderstone.

Secondly, the monsters should probably have been tiered.  The entire theme falls apart when you fight pushovers late game and it causes problems with worthless monsters clogging up the dungeon.

I think the coop variant actually works better since it has a time pressure that forces you to kill stuff in the dungeon while building your deck (i.e. make interesting decisions).

In short it's just kind of tedious.  Dominion had the good sense to be quite short and to end before decks become too cluttered (assuming proper play). In contrast, Thunderstone has a long repetitive buildup where you buy the best card followed by a stomping the strongest monster you can.  But the latter section can bog down since the vanquished monsters enter your deck and the number of monsters is much higher than the number of VP cards in Dominion.

Finally, the card balance is just terrible.  The wizard hero is leagues better than the others.  Fireball is crazy.  Food seems uniformly worthless.  Nothing really combos into each other in an interesting way.  You literally just buy the best cards and kill the strongest monster you can.  It's completely trivial on a decision-making level.  As is getting rid of this game.

This one has been a huge success with my game group.  I don't think it's the game mechanic so much as the theme.  They seem to really enjoy the building up of characters and putting together a part to attach monsters.  I tried D&D with these guys years ago and it didn't go so well so the fact this is such a hit surprises me.  I'll be sure to get the expansions as they come out.

Actually, I would rather play this game than Dominion at this point.  The theme is more engaging and the options are more varied.  However, Dominion is far simpler to teach, much more straight-forward to see strategies towards earning VP, and less random (wrt Thunderstone's monster deck and end-game).  Also, Thunderstone has too many rules "clarifications" and certain combinations of village cards and dungeon cards can be very "un-fun".  So, Dominion ranks higher for me as a game, and I'll end up playing it more because so many more people will be up for it.

UPDATE: I've really downgraded my rating on this one.  Too many confusing rules clarifications needed and the game just drags on and on with the wrong set of village and monster cards.  Ugh.

RATING: 6
I really expected to like this more as it seems to meet a need - Dominion, but with theme. As it turns out, in order to facilitate the theme, just enough has to be taken out for the game to lose some of the tightness and elegance Dominion has. The theme doesn't really seem to match the mechanics satisfyingly in addition. The march of monsters is fine, but a shuffled deck of party members all jumbled together with as good a chance of drawing a hand of torches and weapons with no one to wield them as anything. The less than explicit graphic layout of information on the cards is only a minor nuisance easily overcome. Overall, it's a fine game; just not as exciting as I think one would expect.

The game stole so much from Dominion that you'd think there would have to be a lawsuit.  Maybe there's a great game here, but I felt cheated in the similarities and even greater cheater in the horrific rules provided with the original print.  It felt like a group of kids played Dominion, loved it, wanted to re-work the aspect of scoring victory points and call them monsters, then pasted on new images and printed it without professional help.

I will say the images and card stock were pretty good though.  I traded the game away without giving it a full chance.

The length of play is a deterrent as Dominion and it are similar obviously, but Dominion plays in half the time.

very provisional rating - this is NOT a rethemed dominion. I really dislike dominion, but played this and 90 minutes flew by ... had a real blast, even though we played the setup wrong and only had 3 heroes instead of 4 (which made things very difficult!)

Takes the clever mechanics of dominion and makes a game I like (so far).

Of the two Dominion clones I've played, this one is probably the best.  Much like Arctic Scavengers, it sacrifices simplicity and strategy for theme, and thus feels more random.  It's less about the deck building than adapting to the monsters you see in the dungeon.  Still, and easy pick for anyone who likes Dominion and D&D.

At first, I felt this was a fairly well done dominion clone that overcomplicated a simple and accessible game. I felt like I had less control and that it was harder to pull ahead through smart play.  

The more I played, the more I realized how much more control I seemed to have, and how much more control over my deck the game gave me.  The dungeon also requires a lot of thought and smart play if you want to win. I'm glad I stuck with it as I feel it's a deep and rewarding game, that gets better with every play.

So far I've played one 5-player game and a whole bunch of solo games.  I bought it primarily to play with others (including my wife) and while the solo aspect is always a plus, I wasn't expecting to like it too much.  Solo is hard! (at least on the nightmare level) making the solo game a strategic challenge of how to assemble a deck.  While I'm not overly optimistic about the long-term re-playability of solo (I've played Nightmare about 12 times), I think it'll at least make it to 20 to 50 solo plays which is pretty good.  It's too early to rate on the multi-player game but I enjoyed my one play.  It felt like a dungeon crawl... very different feel from Dominion although the mechanics are very similar.

Deckbuilding dungeon crawler. This is interesting, and I like some of the thematic elements: leveling up characters, depths of the dungeon. It does seem a little grainy, though, and some cards are drastically better than others. I'm told some of the balance issues were improved in Thunderstone: Advance, but I've got other deckbuilders to occupy my time these days.

Does have solitaire rules available, which is helpful for some people.

I love this game and the expansions I have to go with it. I really enjoy deck building games and this has the added fun of fighting monsters in the dungeon. The only thing I've been saying for the longest time is that there should be treasures that you can get from killing monsters in the dungeons and that's why I backed and am really looking forward to Thunderstone Quest. Will rate it when I get it as the new game mechanic sounds interesting.

RATING: 7
Fun game. Nice how they built an RPG on the Dominion mechanic, but there seems to be a little more luck that weighs into this game than Dominion. I find that you can draw a 'useless' hand, while Dominion there usually seems to be something to do. Also as you get towards the end game, almost every monster seems killable so again luck plays a factor: you hope you get a good draw of a monster worth signicant VP. Still, overall a great game.

Good for 1,2,3 or 4. Never tried with 5 but don't see any problem. The theme applies great (not like Dominion where you only play cards ignoring the theme), you can even tell a story. The rules are not clear, but with the great support Alderac offers (updated rules, solo variant, quest variant) the game does not have any place for missinterpretation. For me is not a 10 because it is not complete; many things can make the game better (with an expansion or 2 if well done it will be enough). Very good quality components. Playable in less than an hour for sure. Not sure if I will pick this game up with non gamers; strange theme for them.

There are many aspects of this game that bother me.

First of all the starting deck: The Militias are so bad that the best strategy is to get rid of them as soon as possible. Not only is this unthematic (getting rid of all your soldiers, instead of training them) and unintuitive (new player will usually not think of this strategy) in most setups also leads to a boring start where everybody rests for the first few turns. For 3 XP upgrading a Militia isn't worth it. I think the game would be much better if it would only cost 2 XP or even 1 XP. It would make upgrading Militias an attractive option, which would be thematic and more interesting to play. 

Then there is the two different currencies (money for buying and strength for defeating monsters) and the dungeon halls: this makes this game very luck-dependent. In every deckbuilder you will have sometimes good hands and sometimes bad hands, but over the course of the game it will more or less even out. If you have a particularly bad hand in Dominion, the next one will probably be very good. But in Thunderstone timing is crucial: You need your strong hand with heroes when the the big monster with lots of victory points enters the dungeon hall. You also need the right timing to grab the level 3 heroes before the other players do.

Finally there are many cards that are just awful. You will never buy them because you don't want to have them in your deck (e.g. Battle Fury). On the other hand there are cards that are so powerful that the only viable strategy is to buy them (e.g. Trainer). And then there are cards so powerful that they are no fun to play against (Selurin, not only because of his attack multiplier, but his level 3 ability, which allows him to borrow a hero from the opponent and with the right monster even destroy it.)

For me the game was not very enjoyable until I found out that you have to get rid of your Militias and which cards are the good cards, because without this knowledge you will have very many bad hands in a pretty long and therefore frustrating game. With a better understanding of the game and playing asynchronous online on Yucata it can actually be quite fun though.

Clearly inspired by Dominion, Thunderstone scores points for its tight theming and wider range of options on your turn. I'm preferring this to vanilla Dominion. Games last longer than Dominion though. After 60-odd plays its still one of my favourite games and a firm favourite of The Wife's too.

A lot like Dominion, and while Thunderstone takes much longer, I have to be honest and say that the theme and gameplay are far more appealing to me - so if it came down to a question of which would I rather play - I would have to say this.  A very solid game, with some real choices throughout the game aside from what to buy - there are times when you have little to do, but the game makes me feel I need to be making the most of every hand and opportunity - so it is rarely dull.  Can't wait to play again, my rating could easily go up.

Like it more than Dominion because it feels like there is a purpose in Thunderstone.  

Dominion's game play feels mostly masturbatory, while Thunderstone's play is a lot like clubbing - tons of uninterested women on a night-to-night basis, but every once in a while you get your outfit, pickup lines and hair just right, and you bag one.

This game has the potential to be a 10.  One thing the base set has against it is the need for an expansion.  Playing the Dominion base game, I felt like I was getting the whole game.

The ultimate downgrade in the rating here (from a 10 to an 8) was the eventual discovery of too many power-combos. Feast with a lot of high-power cards (Outlander, Fireball) is pretty broken, Trainer is way overpowered. A lot of basic game layouts can be busted wide open by simply playing a) Buy a Feast or Short Sword if you can, otherwise rest a Militia, then b) run high-powered heroes or fireballs. The expansions tamp this back, but nonetheless there are too many cards in the base set that we ultimately had to ban. Dragonspire + Thornwood Siege + Heart of Doom is the sweet spot for "classic" Thunderstone, and you should skip right to those sets rather than playing the original at this point. Definitely skip the first expansion.
---
Can I just make a comment? Those folks who think that Thunderstone is worse usability-wise than Dominion are smoking crack. Yes, Thunderstone could be better - one problem that people always struggle with is XP vs. VP. Yes, the icons are small, which is not awesome. But Dominion is such a flaming car wreck, with its 4-point text, indistinguishable treasures and victory cards. At least the text on the vast majority of Thunderstone cards is large enough to be legible.
---
After much play (thanks to a copy acquired at BGG.con), Thunderstone has got to be a 10. It's Dominion with nuance. The extra tactical and strategic details give it a significant edge in gameplay over Dominion, as well as the obvious advantage of a hugely successful theme. Also very importantly, Thunderstone has done away with a lot of Dominion's fluff: once you've got a hand, it plays out pretty quickly, none of this endless draw/search/action engine fiddly stuff just to see if you can get up to 8 gold for a province. There are many more interesting choices about how to build and maintain your deck, but once you've made those choices, playing the cards you draw is easy with a minimum of hassle once you get the hang of it. This, to me, is how it should be. It's too bad many gamers will be put off by the fact that it appears to be a Dominion knock-off; yes, it's a related game (OK, closely related), but it's not a knock-off.

The interesting thing is that Thunderstone has rejuvenated my interest in Dominion, which had taken a severe hammering from the Pirate Ship in Seaside. Dominion *is* shorter and cleaner. But I prefer the greater subtlety of Thunderstone.

The box says Thunderstone goes up to 5, but I'd recommend limiting it to 4. It does work with 5, but I think it's better with fewer. If you do play with 5, one option is to include an additional set of monsters (so include 4 varieties instead of 3). It does make the game longer, but at least you'll need more than 15 points to win.
---
First impressions are extremely positive. Yes, the game has heavily looted Dominion for ideas. Yes, the amount of "borrowing" here skirts the boundaries of good taste (a nod to Dominion in the credits would have been a good idea). But CCGs have been around a while, I think it successfully stays on the right side of that boundary and Thunderstone adds to and expands the space, mainly by adding a living, breathing theme, something which Dominion not only so spectacularly lacked, but which it seemed to revel in its total paste-on job.

Anyway, Thunderstone was a lot of fun, I think it has way more expansion potential than Dominion without losing thematic coherence, and if it can hold up, has the potential to replace Dominion for me. Surprised by the "too many turns with nothing to do" comments. You can always do something, thinning your deck by throwing a card away. In my 4 or 5 games I found that there were very few wasted turns, certainly not much different in this respect from Dominion.

Yes, the graphic design is not great. But is it worse than Dominion's? Dominion is such a graphic design train wreck, it's painful to see it not more substantially improved upon (Thunderstone is, in my opinion, a non-trivial improvement. But that doesn't mean it rises to the level of actually being good). Both games are stuck in the early-90s-era CCG land, back when CCG graphic designers/layout people really had no idea what they were doing, and the state of the art has moved very far on. This is not rocket science. Make important numbers larger, make icons distinct. Even I know that.

The one downside I'll perceive is that there just doesn't appear to be quite as much variety in the box as there is in the Dominion base set. The variety of monsters is great, but the heroes doesn't seem to have a ton of range, and the weapons are pretty similar. One of Dominion's strengths (at least in the base set) is its impressive range, although at the cost of about 10-15% of games being uninteresting. We'll see how Thunderstone does.

Definitely a fan of this one.  I like the theme and how it incorporates in the game.  This is one of the few games I enjoy solo as well.
The base game felt very repetitious quickly.  With just WotE this went away.  I love the additional monsters/heroes/villages.  Not so much fond of the traps and treasures needed to be house ruled - you only get it if you defeat the monster and you only get one (any others put back on bottom of deck).  This mitigates the swingy-ness of the treasures.

Game very much like Domininion. Like the game and theme quite a bit also appreciate the non-collectible nature of the game which does not force me to by random booster packs and such. Only disadvantage of the game is the lack of player interaction which is partly corrected in expansions as I understand it.

RATING: 6
I only played this once and it definitely requires a few more plays before I can finally say that I don’t like it – but this was, unfortunately, my first-hand impression. I am disappointed as I really wanted to like it and perhaps replace Dominion (I don’t play a lot of deck-building games), but after my first, and only, play with 2 players, I’m not convinced.

Normally I don’t care about the theme, but I think the theme of Thunderstone is better than the theme of Dominion (which is virtually non-existing). The concept about killing monsters in the dungeon sounded awesome. However, even though the theme is better, I think Dominion is better in almost every other way. You thought there was a small amount of interaction in Dominion? Well, try Thunderstone! In the basic setup there is only a single card which affects your opponents… Perhaps this has changed in the expansions, or perhaps other cards in the base set allows for more interaction – I certainly hope so as it felt almost like playing solitaire! Granted, we were only 2, but this wouldn’t change with more players – all it would do was for the game to last longer – something I definitely don’t think this game needs! I think it takes too long considering the enjoyment I get from this deck-building game compared to other games in the genre. 

Further complaints of mine are that you don’t really want to attack in the beginning in order to avoid clogging your deck with poor cards (though some monsters have an ability you can use). I think you need to spend too much time in the village or simply resting in the beginning, something I wasn’t fond of. Regarding the monsters, if you draw some strong monsters in the beginning, you might have a hard time get going (and nobody wants to remove it so the other players can attack the other monsters more easily). I did like the special abilities and how different the monsters were, though. Finally, I didn’t understand why you have so much gold available each turn, but the cards cost so little – and you have only one buy?! It felt very weird to have 8-9 gold in your hand and a single card when almost every card had a cost of 3-4-5 gold…

One thing I really liked about the game, at least in theory, is the level-up mechanism and the experience points! To me, this is the only reason why I would like to play Thunderstone again. Personally I had too much xp in the end of the game as it was more beneficial to attack instead of upgrading your cards; but I hadn’t noticed that the level 3 heroes grant you 2 VPs, so I guess that would have changed my decisions. The xp mechanic made the game feel like the computer game Diablo or something like that, at least on surface; you have crappy gear, you slay monsters, you get xp, you buy better stuff and is therefore able to kill bigger monsters.

Like [gameid=36218] inside a dungeon, this is a well designed deck-building game.  Some basic strategies from deck-building games carry over, which makes the strategy concepts easier to implement.  I have still only played the starter games, as the games I have played have been the introductory teaching games.  I imagine that as I play more, my rating will most likely go up.

EDIT:  Dropped to an "7" - still a very good game, but Thunderstone Advance is a superior product.  Which is why I traded off Thunderstone.

Wow... probably one of the harder games to rate after two back-to-back plays. Played once, loved it, played it immediately again... thought I could apply what I just learned, and then got utterly crushed with card combos that never happened. Needs a few more plays to find out if this is cracks in the game, or just me (probably me).

One thing for sure, I'll take this theme over Dominion anyday. Now, whether the actual mechanics and gameplay are more clunky than Dominion, I can't say yet. There's a lot to like here initially.

My favorite of the deck-builders!  I like that there's more to it than just building up an engine that can later buy point cards (though I do like Dominion).  But here, you collect resources that can generate gold or be used to defeat monsters in a dungeon.  There are three levels, so you can see what's coming up, helping to figure out your strategy.  I much prefer the original with expansions to the current "Thunderstone Advance" version.  Great game.

I think Dominion might be the better game.  But this one is a fun take on it.  Certainly a game that I'm not ready to abandon.  Indeed, maybe after a number of plays, I'll abandon Dominion, not sure.  So far, though, enough though I've had fun, I'm still working out the tactics of play.

A trashy alternative to dominion with much better art (and, depending on your POV, more appealing).

Thunderstone is a fun game, but it can't hold a candle to Dominion. I can play two or three games of Dominion in the time I can play one game of Thunderstone. Thunderstone requires some manipulation to get a set of village/hero/monster cards that can work together. This is the game's greatest weakness. Things can slow to a crawl if the wrong cards are on the table together. I think Thunderstone is best with two players. Adding more players seems to add a considerable amount of time to the game.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the game and the fact that it is dripping with theme and excellent art work. Sometimes it just feels like work to pull out Thunderstone.

I had high hopes for this one as I loved the deck-building in Dominion. I liked the idea of leveling up heroes, but the rest of it fell flat for me. The game was too long for what it is. It really feels like solitaire, except solitaire while you can't play until the person sitting next to you goes. There are too many numbers on the cards to keep track off and it feel cumbersome trying to add everything up.

I might give Advance a try.

I love the theme.  I'm not completely convinced the game as designed works that well.  Anyway, my first playing I think we got an odd distribution of cards available to us, and the monster row became almost impossible for a long while. I think the game would have been a lot more interesting if there was an additional avenue for cycling the monster deck with a random encounter where you commit to fight a monster from a face down card. The risk is higher, but it allows a pressure release if all the monsters on the row are impossible.

Maybe our first playing was a big outlier, but I've read some other criticisms that make me wonder.

In my eyes, this is one of your standard Dominion-ish deckbuilders with a monster dungeon attached to other cards in play you can purchase. Be aware that this one does not emulate a dungeoncrawl as one might expect. TS is a rather abstract number-crunching, card-collecting game which does have little to do with an adventure-related gameplay the title and theme are suggesting. Excellent artwork.

Someone brought this to game night last night.  We played two sessions.  I could have happily played two more.  While Thunderstone has been described as Dominion-like, I found enough differences that the only things that felt similar were using cards as coins to buy cards and the frequent reshuffling.  Unlike Dominion, players are using heroes who can be equipped with weapons, along with lights and spells to delve into a dragon to slay monsters.  Also unlike Dominion, some cards must be used with another card - a weapon is useless with a hero to carry it into battle.  Very enjoyable.

Update: I finally bit the bullet and bought this and all expansions (which as of now means through Dragonspire). Mainly to play with my son. I still don't think it's particularly great, but it does offer variety, and makes a little more sense what you're supposedly actually doing compared to Dominion.

It still feels like a huge missed opportunity. How they designed a game where heroes level up but monsters don't get progressively more difficult is beyond me.
---
Preliminary rating after 1 play. I get a little tired of these games where you're shuffling your deck all the time, and have no idea what you're going to be able to do on your next turn given a new hand of cards, but amusing for what it is. I like the goal a little more than Dominion, and I like that the monsters (VP) change, so it's not like just getting up to x$ as often as possible to buy the big vp cards.

If you want a deckbuilder, get Dominion.  If you want a second one (to mix it up a bit) get this and Dragonspire (or just poss. just Advance, though I don't have it).

RATING: 7
One thing I love that puts it just a little above Dominion is that all the cards do something (well, except for the plagues). There's no meaningless cards like provinces, and estates that just choke up your deck as gameplay progresses.  The theme is tremendous and I feel like I'm building a band of adventurers to conquer the dungeon, rather than just a race to see who can get the most victory points.  Tremendous game; the box insert could have been better though.  Also, the cover is lacking. I don't think it's a game that would JUMP out at me if I saw it on the shelves.

UPDATE: It's okay, but the sheen that first came with it definitely didn't last.  It's still fun to play.

UPDATE: Now gone, traded away - Never got on board with the expansions, but think I prefer Dominion, due to a wider audience of more willing players.

This game has me really torn.  I want to like it - there's a definite improvement on the basic formula of Dominion here.  But after over a dozen plays I just don't think it's much fun.

The twist on the average deck-building game is you're not just buying up cards, but also trying defeat monsters in the dungeon.  Each has certain requirements to be defeated, so you need to get the right combo of cards to come up in your hand.  That random element can be enormously frustrating, which at times makes me wonder why I'm not just rolling dice.

I'm not writing this game off by any means, but I don't think I need to own it now.  Wouldn't turn down the offer to play a game - it's just not my favorite.

Lots of potential, I really wanted to love this - but unfortunately many screwed up details. Seems to have been very badly playtested, probably to get it out as quickly as possible in the wake of Dominion.

Fortunately, most of the slip-ups were amended in Thunderstone Advance which I regard as the real, post-playtest Thunderstone!

I'd rate the version on [url=http://www.yucata.de/en]Yucata[/url] 0.5 points better than the offline game, because it includes a VP and deck counter and a log during the game, which I regard as very helpful.

I love the concept and theme, but it feels rough - like it really wanted more blind testing. This roughness creates enough minor annoyances (cards that are awesome or terrible on their own regardless of what else is on the board, Thunderstone standoff situations, lots of errata and clarifications, etc.) that I'd rather spend my time on other games.

Most of the rough spots are easy to house-rule over (use a deeper dungeon, don't play with [card X], etc), but the game isn't so amazing that it inspires me to do so.

RATING: 9
Components: Jason Engle's art is exceptional. Every single card is a joy to look at. Excellent quality cards.

The relevant numbers (cost, gold, XP, VP) need to be larger, as they are referenced constantly; I'd also appreciate if the gold value were in the top left corner, and the attack/magic value were in the top right corner, just for easier indexing. Or perhaps the hero level could be in the top left corner. Or the hero/village/monster symbol in the top left corner. Put something in the top left corner!

There is a ton of tiny text on all the cards. It's a hassle to try to arrange the village cards so that even two people can read them without getting neck strain. And it's nearly impossible to read my opponent's upside down cards from across the table, which makes it very difficult to audit each other (and with all the special powers interacting, this game requires a lot of auditing, because we are constantly accidentally breaking rules).

I want the higher level heroes to have more pimped out images, so they look tougher and more rugged. A level 3 hero should look like it could squash a level 1 hero. Also, I wish the heroes had more traditional (or at least more pronounceable) races. Elf and Dwarf are fine; Selurin, Thyrian, and Faeyn are tough to pronounce, and don't really correlate to any fantasy race in my mind. All the made up names start to blur together.

Several other component problems are fixed by later expansions: plastic XP chips; indexable card dividers; a better storage box. The attempt to distinguish the randomizer cards from the regular cards, and from each other, with different card backs would have been more successful if the backings were more different; a slightly different color and slightly different border isn't good enough.

Even the updated rules (1.4) are a bit of a mess. Huge paragraphs obscure important rules and nuances. The glossary fails to address at least half of our card-related questions. We have questions about very basic things (if I destroy my weapon to gain its bonus, do I still get its base value, and is it still equipped or can I equip another weapon?). [Edit 2013-10-22. Most rule questions have been resolved by the latest version of the rules, in Numenera.]

Sometimes there is a disconnect between the monster name/image/health. Something called “The Unchained” that looks like the the most badass demon dragon I've ever seen should have more than 5 health.

Experience: Recruiting heroes, weapons, and spells into my party, then sending a small band into a dungeon is just plain fun. Fun fun fun. Stream-lining my deck is very important (and there are several clever ways to get rid of cards). Also, there are often a few different permutations of heroes + equipment to consider before deciding which monster to face.

The concept of light is excellent. It's highly thematic, finally bringing into play something that always seemed somewhat immaterial in D&D. Depending on how readily available light is, it can become a huge factor in my deck.

Most of my favorite heroes from the series come from the base set; right out of the box there is a lot of variety, and many interesting permutations of cards. I appreciate the monster groups, such that each dungeon will have a certain thematic and functional feel to it, from the intersection of the three groups, but that each group contains several unique monsters. The theme is everything here.

(It's so much cooler to buy a Fireball spell in Thunderstone that any card I can think of in Dominion. I was thinking about Dominion the other day, and thought ironically that Dominion is like “Thunderstone: The Card Game”, in that it's much simpler, has way less theme, plays faster, and isn't as much fun. Without Dominion we probably wouldn't have Thunderstone, but now that I'm playing Thunderstone, I no longer desire to play Dominion.)

There are times when I have a sweet hand, and must choose between venturing into the dungeon, or visiting the village to buy a juicy card and/or level some heroes. Even when it is obvious whether to go to the village or dungeon, it's usually still interesting to decide exactly what to do when I get there.

The concept of the heroes is really cool. They feel distinct, and I love leveling them up. I really like that we must equip weapons to heroes before we can use those weapons; and that the heroes must be strong enough to carry the weapons. The five different classes of heroes (fighter, wizard, cleric, thief, archer) all feel very different, and each serve their purpose in my deck. It seems a bit strange that we can cast spells without magic users in the party (I don't like to think of myself as part of my party, venturing into the deep). Might be a better thematic choice if a cleric or wizard had to be present to cast a spell.

Each random assortment of monsters/heroes/village cards brings with it is own challenges to be overcome. A puzzle to be solved, to figure out how to get light, to discard militia, to handle disease, etc. It's a joy to find the synergy between the cards available, and the best way to counter the monsters. More cards means more possibilities. I've been really impressed with how the game rewards diversity. Putting together a deck that balances gold, light, magic/attack, strength, weapons, spells, etc., is super fun. That being said, it typically doesn't pay to have too many different strategies going on at once.

Runs a bit long (averaging 90 minutes for 2-player games), but cool, cool, cool. And actually, we're always a bit disappointed when the thunderstone is finally revealed, because it's always just as our decks are getting humming. I can easily play this several times in one sitting, and am constantly wanting to play it.

We played three games with the 'epic' set up, where all cards are available, but sorted into random piles by type (weapon x3, spell x2, villager x2, items; archers, fighters, clerics, thieves, wizards). It actually meant a longer set-up and break down time, which I wasn't expecting. And wasn't as much fun. There were the same number of options on a given turn, but because the options kept changing from turn to turn, we had to spend a lot of time reading all the cards. And with only a slim chance of getting the same hero multiple times, it was hard to get pure synergy going in the decks. The lack of competition for certain heroes was missed, and we ended up with all sorts of gold and no level 2+ heroes to spend them on. We're going back to playing the basic setup. We've also tried with having some selection method from the randomizers (e.g. draw 8 heroes, keep 4), but are once again delighting in the challenge of a purely random village.

With two players, the competition for heroes is very stiff. With three players, it's actually a bit less stiff because the game is so much shorter that it makes more sense to just go to the dungeon for any monsters I can. I can't imagine what it's like in a four-player game. Must be brutal. I wonder if higher level heroes are purchased (rather than leveled to) more often than not.

Juego de construcción de mazos, que desde mi punto de vista mejora a dominion en el hecho de que aquí te haces un mazo con algún motivo.

Ahora, que Dominion sigue siendo el padre de todos estos :D

This game scratches every Dominion itch, and then some, as this game actually has some theme that goes along with the game's mechanics.  I believe I'd choose to play this over Dominion head-to-head any day of the week.  In fact, if I owned a copy, there'd be no reason to have Dominion on my shelf, and that's saying something, as I think Dominion as a game is fantastic and ground-breaking.

Only played the basic game -- didn't feel like we had a lot of control, so that each hand became like a randomfest to see if you had the right combos to take down a monster.

I love the theme, but I am not too interested in the original game. However, the game is wide open to interesting variants such as the epic variant which can make the game more similar to other RPG like games like Runebound. One of the things I am not too sure I like is the fact that the defeated monsters go into the deck because it makes more-than-two-cards-combos nearly useless, but I suppose it is really important for play balance.

Improved rating after repeated solo and two-player play. I like this game more and more, and that includes the expansion WotE. Having an interesting solo experience, plus the decision to go to the village or take on a monster (not always as obvious as you might think) is what makes the difference for me. I recommend using a card selection app such as iThunderstone on the iPhone which saves a lot of time in setup (same for Dominion). Perhaps the biggest compliment I can give the game is that I plan to sleeve all 5000 cards (OK, not really that many), essentially doubling the price of the game (I use high quality sleeves).

RATING: 6
While better than Race for the Galaxy, not nearly as fluid or fun as Dominion.  This is a deck building game with a twist, instead of buying victory points, you usually kill creatures to earn them.

The major problem with this game is that it inherently is driven by LUCK than by player skill.  Dominion is a game that is based upon players building up their "expected value" or "average" when buying $ cards.  Once you can expect to get a certain amount of $ per hand, you can then start buying victory cards for the win.  How you go about raising up your average $/hand is your strategy.  Players choices are thus extremely important, but luck plays a part in this.  Usually, player choices are far more important than just dumb luck.

That kind of game play is impossible with Thunderstone.  In thunderstone you still build up your "average" $/card, but it can never be high enough to buy the cards you want consistently and in a reasonable amount of time.  In addition, even if you did build up enough $ to buy a certain number of combat cards, you then can NEVER build up enough combat cards to consistently defeat the creatures in the game, on average.

So since you can't push your averages over 50%, you depend quite heavily on the variance of your deck, and thus you luck.  Thus it's not a game of skill and maneuver, but a game of LUCK!  Player choices are negated and victory is squarely in the hands of chance. Why even play the game?  

And this game also suffers from the "card counting" problem of all card based games.  If you lose track of what you have, good luck competing in this game.

So overall while better than Race, it pales in comparison to Dominion.

Played this one with three players, and it was a lot of fun.  I like that you choose between town, dungeon, and rest.  It keeps the game fresh & becoming something you play on auto-pilot.  The theme works for me, and the battles are challenging, which is a good thing.  The 'light penalty' thing is not as tricky as people make it out to be.  The rules do not get in the way a bit.  Very fun.  --  Update : Solo play gives a good experience.  The rules go well with the theme and offer a challenge.  It is a nice addition to the game that will improve your play.

I believe the first variation on Dominion, with some interesting ideas and a much more engaging theme. Clunky, though, and initially had lots of rules questions and issues that were solved over the expansions. Thunderstone Advance was a much more polished game (despite still having a few issues) and should be played instead of this. The third iteration is being kickstarted, but I'm not willing to put any more money into it in the hopes they get it right this time.

Deck-building pur sang: go to the village to buy characters and items to equip them with or go to the dungeon and fight monsters to gain VP (some of the cards in the village might also give you VP) and obtain the thunderstone at the end of the game. With all the expansions a vast array of cards is available. Each game is played with only a fraction of this wealth of cards, which greatly increases the replayability.

We'll assume everyone can tell this is a Dominion ripoff and move on.

Horrible graphic design.  There are lots of numbers on the card but no symbology to remind you what the number means.  They are also so small you can't see what your opponents are doing and have to pretty much take it on faith that their plays are legal.

As far as mechanics, the basics are similar to Dominion but the additions are clunky.  The "light/dark" mechanic is overly unwieldy and confusing.  Just a straight +/- attack value would have been better.  The mechanic of having the monsters get more "into the light" is thematic but they needed to have a little board to put the cards on with the cheat-sheet of what the attack affect would be and not bother distinguishing light/dark vs. attack.

Strength vs. attack ended up being confusing too.  More than one person accidentally applied "hero strength" to attack instead of to what they could carry. 

Weapon carrying rules (as explained, I didn't read them) didn't make sense - unless a hero has more than two hands they should not be able to use more than two weapons regardless of strength... maybe this was explained incorrectly though.  

Summary - it was ok but not an improvement to its inspiration and I have a bad taste about just how much was ripped off from Dominion w/o a credit.

(Not same as San Juan vs. RftG -- both of those games were specifically designed as a Puerto Rico card game by different designers and San Juan was the chosen one, so RftG got a new theme -- it is much more acceptable that the two games are mechanically similar with that in mind.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A great game using the Dominion mechanics. A little more time for setup and teardown, and not as "clean" as Dominion (more flavor and less strategy). However, the decisions to be made (varying point cards and varying hero cards) make it easier to edge another player out of points, and there are still some powerful card combos that can be leveraged. The theme as well makes the game more appealing to me.

Obvious similarities with Dominion but more going on here. 

Longer than Dominion, but often less downtime due to the lack of "stacking" cards. And it has a theme. :) 

Definitely still prefer Dominion for its versatility, cleaner system & replay value, but this is also worth having, though I think I probably like this more than my regulars ever will.

Will probably need to get an expansion.

Half of the game borrows mechanics from dominion; the other half is about exploring dungeon and figthing monster. Those monsters are victory cars but are also useful (they ain't dead cards in deck like countries in dominion). Heroic fantasy theme is very solid, with village and its heroes struggling against evil dungeon. A very addictive game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Dominion with a fantasy theme, except that it replaces racing for gold with killing monsters and levelling up.

In my opinion this makes for a more interesting game than Dominion, not only because of the theme, but because there's more importance on interaction between cards within each hand. This, in turn, leads to greater variability in the strategies and choices each player makes. And that, to me, is what makes a game good.

There are some complaints people have with the possibility of the starting monsters being too difficult, and the inability to wean your deck of monster cards without losing their VP. The good news is that there are some simple variants out there that address these issues, and I would encourage your local group to use them if you're getting annoyed.

Anyway, thumbs up.

A lot of people talk about how this game is better than Dominion, but I just don't see it. (I've played both the original and "Advance" versions.) My biggest problem is that it wrecks the rhythm of Dominion, in having to check this or that before you go do battle with the monsters. I also feel as if that there needs to be a larger game with the monsters (I know there are some variants out there. Perhaps it's more of a co-op and you're both playing against the score that the monsters too, are building up. Finally, back to the game as is, I feel as if there needs to more interaction.  Dominion has just enough to keep things interesting. Thunderstone has practically none.

 The kids like this one and with the expansion(s), the replayability will remain high. Easy to teach and quick to play (once players are gain some experience- no pun intended). Have converted to playing strictly "epic" versions, wherein all cards may be available for purchase and heroes may only level up through experience. (Vassal)

After playing this game online at yucata many times and one face to face game last night, I finally came up with a rating for this one. As it stands, I don't really care for Thunderstone. When I first heard about the game, I thought that it was based on a nice idea. So I was really looking forward to my first few games. Guess what, my anticipation was replaced by disappointment. And here is why:

* Nearly each game of Thunderstone I played dragged on for what felt like days. While Dominion feels like a light-hearted race game, Thunderstone moves along at an awful slow pace. Sure, there where some games that had the right mix of cards and therefore were fun to play, but Thunderstone couldn't deliver this feeling constantly. I feel like the game could have needed some more devolpment time and some tweaking of the card mix and abilities. While in Dominion nearly every mix of cards plays well, it's the other way around in Thunderstone. So if you find a good mix, stay with it.

* The thing that should be the most fun, namely fighting monsters in the dungeon, is way to mathy for my liking. Don't get me wrong, as a Knizia fan I do like some numbers in my game, but the calculation of attack value is just to involved for my liking. It sucks the fun out of the game for me if I have to watch people calculating all the time.

* Somehow I have the feeling that luck plays a too great role in Thunderstone. While I'm sometimes stuck with a bad draw in Dominion, this seems to happen more consistently in Thunderstone. This kills a lot of the fun me.

update 2016-02-27

Thunderstone has taken a backseat on my shelf for about a year. Recently, I broke it out to test it as a solo game. Lo and behold: It works. It even works fine. Maybe on my n-th attempt I'm finally getting the hang of the light rules. Maybe I'm finally getting around to not having to look up all the iconography in the dungeon just to see whether my fighter can carry that short sword ;) -- Anyway, as a solo game, Thunderstone is pretty good, and *maybe* in a year or so, I can bring it to the table in my game group, fully confident of all the little rules .

----

somehow, I never got the hang of this. I like Dominion well enough, I really like Star Realms, so deckbuilders are fine with me. But in this one, between the Light Rules (did I mention I HATE them?) and the downtime, I don't know... it just never felt thematic enough to justify all those calculations. And I hate when you get a mixture of wounds and killed monsters as your hand and can't do much but buy something cheap in the village.

Plus, I never quite got why it wasn't co-op: To me, it hardly makes sense to see those monster get out of the dungeon and possibly attack the village, but at the same time bickering about who gets to kill them.

Rating of 8 based on a handful of solo games and a couple of 2-player games.

The game has some excellent ideas and is an amazing tool kit. The multiplayer game is a tad static as the monsters just sit there until someone kills them.

My guess is that my rating will go up once the design team comes up with some more exciting ways to set up the dungeon.

For the record, I own Dominion and prefer Thunderstone.

Edit: Rating increased to 8.4 after about five more 2-player games.

A poor man's version of Dominion (in my view). Even less interaction, too much waiting for people to count up if they can defeat a monster or not and not enough interesting choices when buying cards.

It really needs an expansion or two that adds more interaction to the game.

I do think it will and can become much better with repeated play, as it's less fiddly than Dominion at least, but not sure it will replace Dominion as my game of choice in this category.

Update: The game is growing on me so close to a 8 now. Must be the old RPG-er in me. Can't wait for the expansions.

Update 2: I really, really want to like this game more than I do, but simply can't. At first it thought the expansion fixed some of the issues I had with the game but now I'm not sure any more. With the added traps and more dangerous breach effect it's more and more a super random take that game than a game of deck-building and planning. 

"Oh, you got hit with that trap and lost your best level 3 hero and two of your best weapons while I lost a Dagger, oh how fun this is."

I really like Thunderstone and there is no doubt it has gone down a storm in our gaming group. However there are elements in it that really let it down most of all are the sloppy rules and attention to detail. This is the second game from AEG that I have played (the first being Tomb) where I have felt the playtesting has been skipped which makes me pause before purchasing any further games from them.

Draw-play-buy IS like Dominion.  Stop trying to say it isn't.  But this game is way better than Dominion because the game has an arc.  You build your village to hire the heroes to go kill the monsters.  In Dominion, you buy cards that help you play cards to buy cards faster.  Thunderstone's card interactions are so much deeper than five different cards that say +1 Buy.

RATING: 7
Players are equiping a dungeon raiding party, to beat the beasties and find the Thunderstone.  Players take turns either visiting the village to buy a card, rest to trash a card, or visit the dungeon to try and collect some victory points.  A deck drafting game very much in the same vein as Dominion, but with a bit more subtlety here.  You're no longer just racing to bang a deck together to get to the magic 8 gold, instead you're carefully constructing a dungeon party to face off many different types of monsters.  The various card effects really create a nice puzzle to be solved every turn, and the theme is brilliantly applied here... certainly improves on Dominion for me.    Caveat, play at least 2 or 3 games before passing judgment - it takes that long to get use to the icons and flow of the game.

Feels just like a Dominion expansion/variant, no better or worse (not a bad thing).  The randomness of the dungeon is a little annoying, but the expanded choices offset that somewhat.  Best with 3 players, perhaps.

RATING: 3
Gosh, how to critique this on its merits? The blatant appropriations from Dominion aside, this is a poor game. But setting it beside its inspiration further illuminates its flaws. 

The game is a card-based game, yet it doesn't fully utilize obvious things that could be done with cards: discard, card flow, extra draw, interaction with opponents' hands, etc. 

Thunderstone is largely based on 'buy cards according to obvious strategy', and then hoping your draws are lucky enough to overcome the deck of challenges. 

Few in-game decisions seem to matter after you've gone down an initial path. Perhaps later expansions might add some game-play options. But with Dominion or a real CCG as alternatives, why bother? 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Less interactive than Dominion (which is hard to do). It just doesn't flow as well and feels very solitaire. The balance between cards seemed a bit off as well, though I'm not sure how.

11/25/2009 - The game has a Dominion type of engine where players are building their own decks, which is definitely a popular mechanic.

So popular in fact, that I think people initially like this game due to the mechanic.  Overall, the game lacks in the significantly interesting decisions that Dominion has.  This was my decision tree:

#1- Can I beat monsters in the dungeon?  If yes, then kill the one worth the most VPs

#2 - If #1=NO what can I afford in the village.  Proceed to buy the best card

#3 - Repeat.

Which did not lead to interesting choices for me.  Just some optimization of obvious values.  I will give it one more shot before it is banished forever.  Rating = 5

--------------------------------------------------

12/05/09 - Further playing with speedier players and a setup other than the suggested starting proved to be much more interesting.  The key is to be playing almost simultaneously since there is so much information to track in this game.

The faster it went, the better.  Plus more interesting decisions opened up.  Although it did feel like much of the decisions were at the beginning of the game on strategy and it was just a matter of execution.

Rating upgrade to 7

-----------------------------

12/08/2009 - The game has solitaire rules available online.  Too bad it was not in the rulebook, still gives the game a slight upgrade.  Although the novelty is starting to wear thin on me.

Rating upgrade to 7.3

I was worried this might be too much of a Dominion clone, but they don't really feel the same to me, despite borrowing mechanics.   Dominion is more about deck building, efficiency, speed, pruning, finesse, etc.  Thunderstone is about gathering heros, weapons, and smashing monsters in the face with flaming swords.  The artwork is fantastic and consistently so, since it was all done by one person.  The card frames, however, and icons could be better executed.  The game play is a little slower than Dominion, but that didn't bother me since there is a lot to consider.   Wouldn't want to play with 5 players, 3 seems nice.  Expansions should serve this game well.   In general, I think I would choose this over Dominion most of the time.

Got it in Lancaster at the 2010 WBC after I saw a group of friends play. It looked like an interesting game. I enjoy cards with text like Warhammer Invasion. Was told it is like Dominion with a medieval theme. I had to buy this game, was hard to resist once they told me that..

Looking forward to my first game.

*UPDATE I*

Enjoyed my first game. The game finished 28, 22, 21, 21. What made the difference is the last monster for the win for my friend. I had 21 points. It was very close game. What made the difference is that the last monster had to be hit with only magical attacks. My deck wasn't that  good against that particular creature compared to the other players. Next time I will know better.

Want to try this game again with a different setup. Looking forward playing with the other cards.


*UPDATE II*

Played two more games. Rating up from an 8 to a 9.5
The more I play, the more I enjoy playing this game. Wonder if I prefer Thunderstone vs. Dominion.

RATING: N/A
Extremely underdeveloped, to the point where some games may be degenerate due to, e.g., lacking magic attack but that being required to kill certain enemies. This is "solved" by allowing players to give up a turn to banish an enemy to the bottom of the deck, but this creates a dilemma - who's going to give up their own turn to benefit the other players, who will get first crack at the new enemy?

Also, the "basic" set suggested in the rules is simply wrong. It includes guys who should never be purchased as they are less useful than the others.

Otherwise, I like the overall transition from building an engine that enables purchasing to building an engine that slays monsters. It's unclear to me how much to value cards that do both decently.

The red-headed step-child of Magic and Dominion.  First impressions are positive.  Game-play takes longer than Dominion because it requires you to do the math to see if you're able to beat any of the monsters in the dungeon. (kinda my beef with Scepter of Zavandor) Unless you're playing with fast math people, game-play can slow to a crawl.  Set-up time is longer than Dominion because of more cards and rows, but overall it seems like a winner!

An enjoyable deck building game, but after numerous plays it began to feel a bit cumbersome. The random dungeon monsters made it hit and miss, but the biggest gripe I have is the playtime, it is simply too long for such a non-interactive game.

I like it more than base Dominion for the following reasons:

1) Standard sized playing cards!
2) Absolutely awesome artwork, that's consistent
3) Trying to balance your deck to work with Village purchases and dungeon combat.
4) A thematic fantasy game (leveling up heroes... woohoo!)

Overall, I'm still loath to try any more of these 'deck-building games' as the amount shuffling required is infuriating.  I like the variety of these games with the random sets of cards you use, but taking out the decks you need for setup and deconstructing decks after each match gets a little tiresome.

SOLD IT!

Played once and can't wait to try again. Rating may drop if fun factor doesn't hold up. Otherwise I 'think' I may like it more then Dominion... just has more to do then building victory point engines. Even bad turns feel productive when you can rest VS a Dominion turn of going, "OK this is dumb, I'll do nothing and pass".

Dropped rating from 9 to 8 after a few plays, while I like workings of the game, I don't like how it feels untested; cards and rules are poorly explained, seems to be large disparities in the power level of cards to buy. I found my self saying, "well this and this card are the obvious buys, but simply for variety I'll buy these crappy ones as I've never used them."

Dropped rating again to a 5. The sheer randomness of the monster deck and lackluster on low end cards, has left me with a game I feel is great in idea, but terrible in design.

Where dominion is themeless, thunderstone is not. Not sure on the deep strategy yet, but there is definitely more than just building an economic deck gold engine, which is a good thing. Rating has gradually increased from 6.5 to 8.  Surprising fun solo (i'm not a big solo person) up to 8.5

RATING: N/A
A nice variation from Dominion, and also adds a purpose and goal to deck building.  Unlike Dominion (where you are trying to buy victory points), you need to build a deck of heroes and equip them with the proper items to defeat monsters in the dungeon.  You gain VP and XP from defeating monsters, but the monsters are worth little gold and will inflate your deck.  XP can be used to level up your heroes and VP wins you the game.

A first solo game with the base had a slow start, but the strategy clicked and it grew on me. Interested in incorporating the expansions 1 by 1. The setup and breakdown (separating the cards) knock this down a bit 'til I really get into it that it's worth the setup

(As of [b]4[/b] plays) A deck-building game with a more immersive theme than [GAMEID=36218], but with markedly less variety, strategy and interactivity. Some set-ups are fun, but many simply do not work well enough to justify the time. A good game should be enjoyable even when you are losing. Dominion succeeds in this. Thunderstone doesn't quite.

(As of [b]5[/b] online plays) I love playing this game online. The downtime problem is eliminated and, even though scores are updated automatically, falling far behind the leader doesn't seem quite so onerous. I'm enjoying it so much online that I'm ready to revisit it in person.

[b]1 year verdict:[/b] My opinion of this has improved due to the slickness of online play, but in person it is still a bit too clunky for it to supplant Dominion.

Dominion + MtG = Thunderstone?

RATING: 10
Possibly my new favorite game.  The play is similar to Dominion, with players dealing themselves six cards from their personal deck.  But that's where the similarity ends and Thunderstone leaves Dominion in the dust because Thunderstone actually has a narrative.  The players go to a village to buy objects, weapons, spells, and heroes, and then travel to a dungeon to use their heroes to fight monsters.  The experience points gained from beating the monsters can be used to level up the heroes into even tougher fighters/magicians.

The players can fight with magic or with brute force (although some monsters are immune to one or the other).  As the dungeon gets darker the further in the players go, and extra force is required to overcome the light penalties, the player's strategies require more than simply getting the biggest warrior they can with the most brute force. 

Play is fast, with some lag time as players calculate whether they can defeat a particular monster.  The artwork is great.  Cannot say enough good things about this game.

The availability of expansion packs with new heroes, monsters, and objects mean that this game will remain fresh after multiple plays.

RATING: 7.5
A great variation on Dominion. Really worth playing if you liked the original. I have some concerns about whether you even need to ever go to the village after half way through the game, but more plays will sort that out. I really loved it. Cant wait to play more.

Enjoy the theme of this one however in a similar vein to dominion all the game skill is in the first 2 minutes looking at all the options available and deciding what you are going to add to your deck.

The 'dungeon' aspect is nice as it gives you a reason to be building a deck rather than just to collect victory points.

Unfortunately AEG are throwing cards out for this so fast I am unable ...and unwilling to keep up.

12/10/09  Been thinking about Dominion quite a bit (sign of a good game). I want more theme and less focus on one card or two. Maybe Thunderstone?

1/27/10  I played Thunderstone last night. I think I liked it more than Dominion in almost every way.

1/27/10  @mischakrilov Yeah, I liked it having a theme. I liked the longer (but not too long) playtime & it not just boiling down to a killer combo.

4/13/10  Played Dominionx2. I'm kind of indifferent to it still and I think it's kind of souring me on Thunderstone, too. Genre might not be for me.

9/21/10  Ascension was fun. I liked it better than Thunderstone and much better than Dominion. Maybe this whole deck-building thing will have legs.

Far less elegant than the original source Dominion; my deck seemed to peak early and I held back from buying anything from the village on many turns.

There were lots of little calculations as monsters modified strength and light and attack.

[5 plays]  I really had fun with this one, but can't really give it a higher rating because I can already tell it's going to wear out its welcome quickly.  My major complaint is that the monsters are just too damn easy except for a few dragons.  The rules in the box are terrible, the points for the thunderstone are totally lame, there's even less interaction than Dominion, and the game turns tend to drag as people count up their strength to go to the dungeon.  Still, I really like the leveling up of the characters and slaying of monsters.  It's possible things could be tightened up with an expansion, but I'm not holding my breath.

RATING: 8.75
Dominion is one of my top 5 favorite games, and after around 5 plays of Thunderstone I'd say it's just as good. I'll have to play it more before I could give it a 10, but so far so good. I love the twists on the basic Dominion system. If the expansions can keep up the nougaty goodness of the base set, then this could move high in my rankings.

It has an even worse problem than Dominion with physical upkeep. The games are more involved and last longer which makes the maintenance time less daunting, but the extra length really doesn't come with extra entertainment. It's more murky than Dominion and doesn't give you as many opportunities to make meaningful decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Ok, after numerous plays I've come to realize that this just is not a very good game. It's clunky, scales horribly with more players, and it is just frustrating. Rogues/Thieves do nothing but irritate everyone, and there's no defense cards like in Dominion. Someone plays a Thief, you just suck it up. The leveling mechanic seems fun until you realize that everyone quickly snatches the heroes on the table until you at some point draw a level 1 hero to realize there are no more level 2's of that type out there. This is the part that bothers me mostly about the game. And with only 4 hero stacks, they go quickly. Right behind that are the high dollar weapon cards. You get these early ensuring some nice high dollar hands in the near future, but there is no other source of getting money into your hand, meaning that once those weapons are gone, your deck starts diluting without any chance of repair.

I have Dominion and all its expansions (as of 9/17/11), and yet I am in the minority of folks who thinks Thunderstone is a better game.    Dominions's first half is great fun, but6 the 2nd half is just a race to grab VPs with your card engine.   Thunderstone is still a Dungeon crawl throughout.  Maybe the D&D theme just works better for me --but I feel like the mechanic and the theme really go toether --whereas in Dominion it feels more pasted on.  I really like Dominion, but I'd rather play Thunderstone.   Every time.

Csak az alapjátékot próbáltam, annak is az online változatát. Nagy dominion rajongó vagyok, és szeretem a fantasy jellegű dungeonos játékokat is, szóval nagyok voltak az elvárásaima  játékkal szemben. Sajnos csalódnom kellet. Nem érzem benne a dominionban megismert mélységet, sokkal kevesebbet múlik a stratégián, és sokkal több a keverésen. Cserébe ad valamennyi feelinget, ami a dominionhoz viszonyítva persze nem egy nagy feladat. :)
Gondolkodtam a megvásárlásán, de az online próba után biztos, hogy nem veszem meg. Persze azért szívesen kipróbálnám ezt is élőben is, nomeg esetleg kiegészítőkkel. Állítólag úgy sokkal jobb.

RATING: 7
A step up from Dominion, and not only because this game actually HAS a theme. You get the impression you are actually trying to defeat monsters and level up heroes. Earning VP is a side effect of the game.

The gameplay is wonky though and there are numerous loose ends. I'm sure they are all fixed in FAQ but I don't care enough to bother.

RATING: 5
Dominion: The Dungeon. At least pretty much. It may not be as streamlined as Dominion but it makes it up in theme. I actually like Thunderstone better than Dominion (admittedly that's not saying much) for a couple of reasons.

First of all it feels a lot less abstract thanks to the fantasy theme. Going to the village, hiring heroes, equipping them, and then entering the dungeon to battle monsters somehow feels more satisfying than "I scraped together enough gold to buy a duchy, yeah". It's also much harder - if not impossible - to burn through your deck at the same ridiculous rate so you're not necessarily bound to see the same nauseating, sleep-inducing combo a million times in a row. There are actually reasons to diversify. Hooray.

That said, the light mechanic feels a little clunky, not being able to level up when the higher level heroes have all been hired doesn't make sense, and the end game condition is pretty arbitrary. So not all is gold that twinkles, but still, better than Dominion.

RATING: 7
The first game was much more positive than expected. Similar enough to Dominion to be comparable, yet different enough to be its own viable game in its own right. 

The strategy is a bit off for a dungeon crawl as you tend to manipulate the rules to improve your hand instead of simply killing all the bad guys. Jumping in and failing to kill a monster just so it will destroy your militia is a viable and strong strategy. It's still plenty of fun, just thematically screwy from time to time.

Downgraded to a seven. There are too many set ups that just don't work. You have to know this game inside and out to be able to see when you are going to run into a game where you just won't have adequate cards in the supply to combat the monsters.

And upgraded to an 8. Yucata.de takes all the annoying parts out of Thunderstone and allows you to play in a purely fun environment. This is the first time where I have found online play to be more fun than in person play. My only complaint is that the game only has so much life in it without expansions.

After  Facebook Thunderstone, I have downgraded the game back to a 7. It's a pretty great game, but you have to know it well to enjoy the nuances that aren't apparent. By the time you get to that point, it is hard to find anyone to play with as they have to be just as dedicated to understand the great parts in the game. 

...and then Facebook Thunderstone went away. Lame.

After played Dominion a lot i was really eager to play Thunderstone ,which was described as "a thematic deck building like Dominion".At first i was really excited about the variety of the cards which give the game great replayability but after a while,i discovered that because of that big variety the big advantage of Dominion was lacking in Thunderstone,downtime and big duration. Although i thought it was a really good game which i would like to play again(but still i prefer Dominion)

I still kind of dig this game, but as the card pool increases, so too does the possibility of completely unworkable card pools.  With so many dependencies of cards on other certain card types, this is inevitable.  So you end up with creatures with physical immunity, but no magical weapons nor characters with magical attacks.  Game over, g'night.  Or a character who depends on a certain weapon type, but not one of them makes it into the pool.  Hey, prepare to gather cobwebs, hero dude.

Once Nightfall came out, my interest in this plummeted.

It's still got great artwork, I love the theme, and it still is like that crazy drunk uncle who shows up at parties and does batshit insane stuff that just makes you laugh.  Thunderstone, if it were a high school student, would be that one from the 70s who drove around in a van with an airbrushed picture of a bald eagle with a confederate flag headband playing electric guitar.

Thunderstone is a great game deck-building game that is similar to Dominion, but has way more theme and is a bit more complex, but for some reason we don't seem to play it very often when compared to Dominion. Maybe it is the simplicity of Dominion that makes is easier to bring to the table. But I do love Thunderstone and I need to play this way more.

Yeah! Thunderstone works well. I was happy that we were able to get into it so easily. This game flows nicely and turns come quickly. Dominion may be the purer game, but Thunderstone is a marvelous beast and worthy of the deck-building genre of games, which has since become saturated.  The designers have called this "deck-building with a purpose" and I agree. It is so much easier to get into the theme of Thunderstone than Dominion. The monster fighting, leveling up, and variety of heroes, monsters, weapons and spells makes this one of my favoutites. Overall, if there could only be two deckbuilders in this world, I'd pick Dominion and Thunderstone. And if there could be only one? I might have to chose this one.

I had to take this down a couple of slots after more plays.  The game simply doesn't have the replayability of Dominion.  That may changes somewhat with the expansions, but we really started to burn out on this one already, and that wasn't the case when we just had the core set for Dominion.

Still, the theme is easier to sell to many of the gamers around here, so I'm sure it will hit the table again at some point.

Dominion with a splash of MTG.  i can get out of MTG and spending a chunk of money every few months and play this game.  a game that plays much better than Dominion, albeit slower.  here, you actually have theme that comes through in gameplay.  Dominion has always felt a bit chaotic...everyone taking their turn in a few seconds, mostly multi-player solitaire if everyone gets too involved in their own hand/strategy.  in Thunderstone, the dungeon creates a real sense of head-to-head competition here with rich theme.

RATING: 5
This is a dungeon crawl with the added feature of drawing your team of adventurers and their special equipment from a deck that you will build and refine each turn - instead of a dice roll to determine if you beat the monstor or trap, it is the draw of cards to your deck that provides the random factor. The game does not use  many of the clever deck engine mechanics of Dominion, so the main game mechanic is card drafting - when you deal yourself an appropriately strong hand then enter the dungeon to slay monsters and gain VP. Very good components and art. The theme has some disconnects such as being able to upgrade your heroes with experience points earned by fighting monsters - or you can just buy a higher level hero from the draft pool! - intended to make a "money" strategy viable but readily house-ruled out to make only experience gained from detroying monters able to upgrade your heroes - as it should be! Benefits from using the card randomiser available from bgg as certain monster/village/hero card combinations can be tedious.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The art is great! I like Thunderstone's theme way more than Dominion's...but the game drags a bit.

Intelligently populating the village card piles is a MUST! Don't rely on pure randomization or this game will drag on and on as no one can kill anything and keep the game in motion.

I would suggest buying the Doomgate legion expansion as well. The treasure cards can help out a great deal in keeping the game running smoothly.

Trap cards are detrimental and can really kill a game. (Bye bye heroes...hello useless deck!)

Basically...a fast game of Thunderstone > Dominion IMO....but a SLOW game of Thunderstone < Dominion.

RATING: 6
Not as streamlined as dominion but I really like the heroes and dungeon element. I wish it were more interactive and had better rules/card clarity. A coop dungeon crawl variant would be a lot of fun. Mainly I like it because it eliminates the draw your entire deck mechanism in dominion.

Update: played with all expansions up through dragonspire. The expansions are quite nice and add a lot to the experience. This is a fun light game and is fun to get out on the table. Enjoy it quite a bit with the right company and mentality.

My first couple of plays, our games got bogged down debating some of the meanings on the cards.  To me that is not fun.  We found some answers on BGG and some we just just made rulings on.  Once we got all that out of the way, we played a lot of Thunderstone in a relatively short period of time.  It was interesting and different.  But then we got into playing other games again and we haven't touched it again.  If others wanted to play it, I'd happily join in, but given a choice, I'd rather play Dominion.

i can't see the reason for its comparison to dominion. they are two very different games, asides from the deck building mechanic. i must say that i much prefer thunderstone. though coming from dominion, i'm very used to chaining my action cards to optimize my buys, and so when playing thunderstone, i was disappointed to draw a hand with lots of gold but only have one buy to spend it on. other than that, it's a very enjoyable game that's just oozing with theme. to spice the game up, i recommend incorporating some of the rules from thunderstone advance: the additional option of being able to "prepare" for your next turn, and having to fight a guardian monster for the thunderstone. it just felt kind of anti-climatic before, to get the thunderstone after defeating a low health monster in rank 1.

Kind of like a fantasy Dominion, but with some new and interesting choices above and beyond Dominion. I just played the intro set-up, but now I'm eager to try out some of the other cards. I liked the mechanics, the art, the flow of the game.

Ah, Thunderstone.

On the one hand, Thunderstone has a very good system, one that builds on the stunning model of Dominion but does very much its own thing with it. It embraces its theme and makes great use of it.

On the other hand, a chimp with rabies could have written a better rule book and the game has so many balance issues that we had to add more house rules than monopoly at a familty reunion.

However, I do have to say this. We did keep on playing and wishing painful diseases on whoever edited the rule book in order to develop those house rules.

This was one of the first deck-building games that were published after Dominion and it shows its legacy.  The turns are faster in Thunderstone because you mostly use the cards you get instead of chaining a lot of actions. I also like the theme more, but there doesn’t seem to be as much depth in game play and it feels more the same each time you play it. Also, sometimes the hardest monsters come out first in the game, meaning that there isn't a real story arc and make the game stop up. People were asking for a more interactive Dominion, but this is not the game. Actually, I think there are more ways in Dominion to screw other players’ decks. That said, the game as an activity is quite fun.

One play with three, two with four. Fairly enjoyable. I think it does some things better than Dominion, some things worse. Obviously the theme is more coherent, and it's fun when everything comes together in your hand and you're able to take down a nasty monster. On the other hand, Dominion seems to be the more subtle and interesting game. I could be wrong, but I feel like Thunderstone will get old quickly without a steady injection of new cards.

One substantial complaint: horrible job on the card iconography, AEG. Everything's in little circles! The first time you play the game, how are you supposed to remember which corner is VP, which is XP, and which is strength? You could have branched out to other shapes, perhaps, like maybe you could have put the numbers in little chubby exes or vees. I'm not trying to tell you how to run your company or anything, but the funny thing about circles is that one looks just like another.

One more thing: if you're going to rip off Dungeons & Dragons, why not at least have it make sense? I mean, why the hell is there a flying horse in a dungeon? Did it get lost? Did it lose a bet? And a griffin, too! Why not an entire airplane? Let's have the whole frigging air force down there underground where they'll be as useful as a hand crank on a pith helmet.

Very nice components, and easy to pick up especially if you played Dominion already. It shares some mechanics with this venerable game, yet it has mechanics all of its own. 

I definitely prefer Thunderstone as for its theme. 

Nice, I liked it and hope to play it again... even if I have to admit that it was a tad long for what it is.

Playing this on Yucata.de this is becoming quickly a favourite game!

First encountering Thunderstone in 2017, most of its flaws just seem like aw, poor thing, they didn't know any better. If a deckbuilder with these problems came out today I'd be mad, but... aww!

Comparison with Dominion is unavoidable, and this game loses on all accounts.
A poorly implemented theme is worse that no theme, and too many things simply makes little sense.

A neat RPG take on Dominion.  The game takes a good four times or so as long to play, though.  But, if you're familiar with Dominion, there's not much else to learn here.

After a couple games my main complaint is that hero leveling seems sort of wrong -- especially in a five-player game, random strings of bad luck can give you a stack of XP that you've worked hard for and absolutely nothing productive to spend it on because the leveled-up version of your guy is gone.  Maybe this is more avoidable once you know the game more.

I have mixed feelings about this game. There isn't much to the gameplay. It is very random and repetitive, while choices are usually limited and easy. The unclear rules, constantly updated by the publisher, are annoying. So is the constant shuffling. It borrows too heavily from "Dominion", a game I don't like. There are also graphic design issues, with nearly indistinguishable icons and small font. Despite all that, I have enjoyed the game and want to play more. But I realize my enjoyment of it has much to do with the Fantasy theme and excellent artwork. I'm just afraid it will not take long until the novelty wears off, and then I may be much less willing to play it.

RATING: 8
So it's Dominion, and yet it isn't. Its qualities are directly the inverse of Dominion's--it's got good theming, you'll never focus on just 1 or 2 cards (or money), and you'll never have endless "+draw +action" turns (that usually end up with 3 money anyway).
On the other hand, the iconography and game text is a borderline nightmare and the game takes a bit too long. The random monster setup can lead to strange situations, and the balance is off in places. 
Overall, I prefer this to Dominion, but I do feel like it could have kept more of Dominion's strengths while improving on its weaknesses. I am very much looking forward to the expansion.
[EDIT] Simple variant that makes things all kinds of better--show five monsters (or even four) instead of three in the dungeon hall. 
[EDIT] Use the Intelligent Randomizer online. It's not a neccesity, but man does it improve things.

I don't like Dominion and Thunderstone even less. They share some things I don't like, but each game has it's own flaws as well. Away from the huge luck-factor, it is unnecessary overcomplicated to a point where I call it bad design.

This doesn't have the combolicious five minute turns you sometimes get to enjoy in the Dominion, which is both a good and a bad thing. Since this makes up for them with longer playtime, which let's you really get in to the feeling of leveling up your heroes and equipping them with the biggest and baddest sharp things and spells available, I totally forgive it. Having a theme that you actually notice puts this before it's daddy D for me. It's even fun to "play along the theme" (it's not yet close to roleplaying, but in the same direction) as a selector on what to do when multiple possibilites present themselves.

What a very nice idea that actually was a totally derivative disappointment.  I expected this game to build on and maybe fix some of my issues with Dominion but instead I got a game that maybe worsened some of the problems.  This has even LESS player interaction and is maybe even more prone to disruption by card draws than Dominion is/was.  Just shitty all around, and you are still just deck maximizing for victory points.  Blah!

It is a fun game and if it came out before Dominion people would probably rave over it, BUT it isn't the dominion-with-a-theme-and-interaction replacement everyone was hoping it would be.

Deck-building game like Dominion, but with a D&D-type vibe (attacking monsters in the dungeon using our clerics, fighters, thieves, and so on).

The theme is more present than in dominion; I like to play it with Fudge dice to add a little imprevisibility (I understand that trap cards do that) which is more thematic I think.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If base Dominion is the minimalist reduction of deck-building for deck-building's sake, then Thunderstone is it's younger, slightly bloated cousin, full of flavor, but slower moving, with a greater palette of colors and probably a wider range of strategies, but not as focused, and certainly not as rushed.

Thunderstone added a story to Dominion's abstraction, and added a serious helping of Fantasy RPG to the Mediaeval backdrop, while removing the slightly Political overtones.

Thieves, Brawlers, Villagers of all stripes, yes, they share these, but Thunderstone is a story, Dominion is a cat fight.

Thunderstone is a trip through a Dungeon deck (the timer) heading for the possible recovery of a magical relic, the eponymous Thunderstone.  A random set of monsters makes up that deck, and players use a set of Village cards (resources) and Hero cards (combat/resources) to venture through the Dungeon, heading for the bottom of the stack.

Thunderstone tends to start slowly, similar to Dominion, but I find it builds more slowly, and deck-thinning may be slightly less important here (I do tend to play solo, which probably influences that judgment).

Often the pace of the game is dictated by the match of Enemies in the Dungeon deck to the Heroes; sometimes the Heroes match up well and even an early player deck will defeat low and mid-ranged Enemies, sometimes it does not match as well and Warriors need unavailable magical assistance, particular classes are removed, or Sorcerers and Clerics face tough creatures they cannot easily hurt.

This is not unlike Dominion: some sets of cards are simply more fun to play than others.

I rate both Dominion and Thunderstone a 7; I like them both for different things, elegance/ease of play vs. story/struggle.

Both sets are expanded by many sets of cards and some added rules as they go along. For Thunderstone I have not found that this changes the game much, only adding to the card selection; for Dominion the card selection is the game, and the sets make perhaps a more profound change in the experience.

I like them both, and I'm glad I picked this up- it adds a little Fantasy RPG feeling back into my life that has been missing since D&D.

More choices can be made, and there is more than one way to use most cards. The scoring is more interesting, and it's harder to predict the winner.

All in all it's a solid game, but it's not Dominion. Best to play this with experienced players who are also experienced with Dominion for variety.

Wow! I really dig this game! I'd held off buying it for a long time; on paper it looks like it's going to be a straight Dominion rehash, and since I've got and enjoy Dominion, what would be the point of a rehash?

But after several plays, I can tell ya that it sure don't *feel* like Dominion: this is an Ameritrash dungeon crawl in Dominion clothing! You don't have the same ability to control your deck or form a "machine" as you do in Dominion, it's much more about taking the hand you've got and doing the best you can with it.

If I've got a complaint, it's that I wish the dungeon aspect were less deterministic as a rule. You generally always know if you've got the firepower to go into the dungeon, so it can be kinda rote. But for those heroes with a "draw card" power, it gets really interesting, as you're more inclined to take a risk and try for a monster that you might not take down with a bad draw.

But that aside, I look forward to playing this more! Like Dominion, the game will continue to show itself in new light with different random card arrays.

**UPDATE**
OK, I've played this about a dozen times, now, and the bloom is off of the rose. The dungeon aspect is really silly and boring. It doesn't at all feel like you're questing: you're buying monsters with attack points. I don't need to play this again any time soon.

It's almost like someone was thinking of me when they designed this game.  Totally, totally up my alley and really one of the best new games I've played in a long while.  The idea of playing this game excites me.

Update: Played a few more times with random setups - this game is WAY deeper than it seems on the first few plays.  Really feels like Dominion but with just a touch more to keep track of when building a deck.  Considering both hero/stuff ratio, dilution from winning trophies, and making sure you have enough light in addition to trying to thin out the stuff you don't need.  Also, the whole decision between running thick and thin decks (via purchasing vs. leveling heroes) is really cool.  This game is an A+ from me.

Imagine Dominion with no action cards, just money and points, but with different currencies available for getting money and points.  If you think this sounds tedious, well, I agree.  And that's pretty much exactly what Thunderstone is. The cards' powers don't let you manipulate your deck or draw cards or do other things of substance. They are just more or less powerful for getting the monsters (victory points) or for getting other cards that allow you to do so. (3 plays)

Earlier comments: I'm not sure who decided that Dominion needed a theme, but I certainly don't think that the theme is worth the cost in the smooth gameplay that is Dominion's greatest asset. The problems are probably just a function of the way the theme is implemented.  It's clunky and counter-intuitive, with lots of adding and the potential for things to very easily get blocked.  No need to play again.

Adds the words "game" and "fun" to Dominion's mechanics. Unfortunately, I can no longer get it to the table - none of my gaming friends like it enough, and I find K2 better for solo (actually I don't play solo anymore). Besides, I found out that as much as I love the "old" deck building games (where you build a deck or an army before the game), that much I hate the new deck building games (where building the deck is the game itself). Still, this and Star Realms are the only ones I'd play.

When you play this game, instead, you find yourself much more frustrated due to the fact that the cards don't interact with each other very well at all. There is a major balance issue. Every card is either made to be a good village card or a good fighting card. Therefore if you find yourself with a 50/50 mix in your hand you're screwed with either choice you make. The town guard is a great example of this.

The light mechanic that they implemented needs a lot more refinement. There were times when I had nothing but light in my hand but it didn't do me a bit of good because it doesn't infer any bonus, just negative effects when lacking but in order to ensure you draw some in your hand you load the deck with it. Well, during the first game but after you figure out that it's better to buy a weapon to just add 2+ to your overall attack damage, light is no longer an issue. Speaking of which, another card interaction that doesn't work is items and how they have to be equiped on characters. Numerous times in the game I drew items into my hand that couldn't be utilized due to weaker characters.

On the upside, the theme to this game was far superior to Dominion. The idea of leading a band of heroes against the monsters in a dungeon was done well. I can see how they tried to execute this with the mechanics that they put in place but it really should have been done with a lot more finesse. The aspect that really works are the illustrations. I love 'em! The monsters are all wonderful as well as the heroes and the items. Each brings out the geek in me and makes me want to play.

All and all I can't say this game is absolute trash but it is by far nothing great. It is very much a 5 for me. Take it or leave it and I have a feeling that with more plays it may go the way of munchkin and get old very quickly.

Complete Thunderstone set. Well it's kind of my first modern designer board game and to this day I like it a lot. So many interesting choices and combos it never gets old. Of course it's a little bit swingy but that contributes to the fact that it stays fresh.
Good game- stop reading this and go play it yourself.

OK . . . the basic engine here is drawn right from Dominion.

That being said, I kinda liked this game's theme better than Dominion.  [Not to detract from Dominion, but this one just captured my imagination a little more.]

A few of the Level 3 heroes can be quasi-broken with the right other cards / monsters.  Need to be careful about the card selection for a game.  [Note: there are a few cards in the expanding universe of Thunderstone cards that can make a game simply not fun.]

Very happy to see this implemented at www.yucata.de

I just don't tend to like deck-building games, and this one didn't do anything to change that. Lots of looking at my hand and trying to figure out if I can combo modifiers such that I can kill one of the monsters, then watching the other players do the same. Took way too long for me to give it another chance (even though I won!).

Cannot escape being compared to Dominion. Adds a lot of thematic depth to the "deck building" mechanic. There aren't nearly as many dynamic interactions between cards, which is ok by me as I'm not as into the combinatorics. This is about building an efficient monster-killing engine. Great expansion potential.

RATING: 7.5
This game uses the mechanic popularized by Dominion, deck building, and takes it to another level, to where Dominion have not been able to do, and, basically, kills it. This game is amazing and very fun to play. The evolution of heroes, expending experience and money to improve. The cave mechanic, the light, weapons, then the monster that you beat... they have taken the mechanic and made a game. I think that the game works very well and is very nice.
Positive:
1. Deck building mechanic finally has an interesting purpose
2. How the cave works and the light factor
3. The experience and improving your characters
Negative:
1. The first rounds of the game are more or less always the same. It may be boring
2. If the first monsters drafted are tough, the initial evolution of the game takes longer and it can be more boring
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Dominion with a theme, really not much more needs to be said, I do like the dungeon theme so I did like this more and the theme worked for the most part where Dominion really doesn’t have any theme at all as much as it would like too.  

Not a bad filler but overall the deckbuilding just doesnt keep my interest a whole lot, I need an actual game with more important decisions than just what card to buy and when. Still good, just not really my cup of tea. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I quite enjoy playing this game, and it usually delivers a good time.  What stops this rating from being higher is that the gameplay feels very channeled to me, in that successful decks all look more or less alike.  A bigger problem is that the winner is often decided by who gets fortunate with the draws from the monster deck.  As a consequence, this feels a little more predictable and luck-driven than Dominion.  That said, it's made it into a regular rotation, and I very much look forward to the new sets.

RATING: 10
One of the best games of the last 5 years! Sure it ripped a page right out of the Dominion book but I find building your adventure party and fighting the monsters soooooooo much more enjoyable.  I've since traded away all of my Dominion sets. I don't see the point of owning both. 

This game is my second favorite all-time, second only to Age of Steam. The theme makes this game GREAT. It's surely not for everyone but it's 100% up my alley and I look forward to each and every expansion.

I much prefer Dominion... just as I love San Juan but am not so hot for Race for the Galaxy.  This just adds needless complexity that slows down the game with out adding much except theme (and I'm one who cares much less about theme than I do game play and mechanics).

update: now with 3 plays under my belt I still don't care for this Dominion want to be... we even played with an expansion, one that added even mess to it that adds "Treasures"... with 6 treasures only two players split them evening, the other 2 of us never got one... way too random

Egads, it actually works!

First off, I couldn't care less about the particular theme of Thunderstone. Games don't get extra points from me for being dungeon-crawls. That being said, Thunderstone is a fine game, even if one just considers the mechanics. And the theme does work well here.

It's longer than Dominion, and more complex, the latter both in terms of the amount of rules, and the complexity of the decisions you have to make during the game. The rules are less clean than those of Dominion, and the graphical layout is horrible.

Having played three games, my first impression is that it is a more interesting game than Dominion, but also longer and more fiddly. Better or worse? I don't know yet.

I do look forward to trying Thunderstone again, to see if it can maintain its initial very favorable impression.

Having played this after playing Thunderstone: Advance there's some things in it that aren't as clear as Advance.

But overall it still feels very good with some minor rules differences which did improve the overall feel in Advance.

Still a solid deckbuilder.

Build up your army and either go to the village to stock up on supplies or delve into the dungeon to stop the monsters from coming out and obtaining the elusive thunderstone.

Not feeling it.  I'll stick to Dominion.

Edit:  I've played a few times now, and every game has been excruciatingly long and boring.  It doesn't seem to be nearly as forgiving if there's a less-than-optimal card setup, so many games come out feeling pretty janky.  I don't know how anyone could possibly want to play this anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Thunderstone is fun, but the mechanics are a bit iffy. It's too easy to develop a shortage of light, or money, or power to actually go adventuring, and if you randomize the monsters, you can have huge difficulty swings.

Initial Rating : 6.5 (February 2012)

Warning: I love Dominion

I wish Dominion had this theme, that is the ONLY advantage Thunderstone has over Dominion. Having saying that, I enjoy Thunderstone from time to time. It is an ok game and my second favorite deck builder (or fourth if you count the hybrids Mage Knight and A Few Acres of Snow). It is more similar to Resident Evil than to Dominion, although I like that the monsters are visible BEFORE you go to the dungeon, but they add another luck factor to the game. (In resident Evil you don’t know what you are facing so it has even more luck).  If you can defeat the monster early on, the game can take a long time to play and this happens a lot.

The art is decent, better than in Dominion but in general the graphic design can be a little confusing. (This doesn’t not happen in Dominion)

Thunderstone is more complex than Dominion, but that added complexity doesn’t translate to fun. For example I don’t like that in Thunderstone you have 3 currencies (Money, Light, Attack power) and balancing them is not as fun as I thought. What I’m saying is that attacking the monsters in the dungeon is not as fun as it should be. I don’t feel I’m “destroying” them so the theme starts to crack. Also the experience counters come to mind as unnecessary complexity. 

In my initial games I always drew 5 cards instead of 6 because I’m used to play Dominion a lot :S.

I have mostly played online so I have had no access to all the cards, but from what I have seen, I’m a little worried about balance issues, there are some cards and combos that appear to be very powerful, although as every player has access to them it is not a big deal.
 
In conclusion, I will play again this Dominion clone from time to time, but Dominion is still king for me. I would like to try some expansions which many people claim make the game better. 

Current Rating: 6.0

RATING: 7
To say Thunderstone is "better than Dominion" would be overly subjective, and I'm not sure it would even be accurate.

Thunderstone seems to deliver what I was looking for, and didn't find, in Dominion.  It's longer, which gives it more time to develop a story arc.  There are two different things to do (and resources to manage):  Gold/Village turns, and Attack/Dungeon turns.  I suppose it's still an economic engine game at the core, but Thunderstone applies a veneer of top-down Ameritrashy theme that is very welcome in this burgeoning genre of "buy cards, reshuffle, buy more cards" games.

Rough around the edges as it may be, no one will accuse Thunderstone of being soulless.  Unless perhaps one's fighting the undead.

Excellent theme and the artwork is quite nice. That being said, those to me are the two most appealing aspects of this game. Unlike Dominion, the card balance can be a bit lacking. This is more evident in some setups than others with some cards becoming nearly worthless and others becoming extremely powerful. The length can be tedious as well, especially when you have a runaway winner.

I can't understand any argument that states this is very different than Dominion.  Gameplay is simple - build an efficient deck of the available cards to earn points.  Thunderstone gives you an option on your turn - buy a card OR kill a monster.  It's rarely an option - either you can kill a monster OR you can't, so you buy a card.

With all that, I like the game quite a bit.  But I'm also a big Dominion fan so that shouldn't be a surprise.  I certainly don't believe it's different enough to warrant owning both.  It's a great alternative for someone who didn't get into Dominion.

A great deck building game filled with a fantasy theme. Plays super well solo or with opponents. Plenty of great cards coming out all the time with the expansions. Check out on how to play the epic game. I prefer this method. You get to play with all cards in the village. Choose monster's level based on their victory points. All heroes are available in four separte piles. Just the level one heroes, still have to upgrade to get the higher levels. Great art workd. A little time consuming to set up when doing a basic set up. You have to choose random heroes, monsters and village cards. Find them in the box and set up. Clean up takes time because all the cards are pretty well mixed up. In epic, once they cards are split into the right categories, set up is slightly quicker. Clean up is also speeded up. 
Games can go a little long, as everyone is building up a good group of heroes and weapons and support cards. Well worth buying and you will be pulling this off of your shelf for friends and playing the super solo game. Enjoy.

UPDATE:
=======
I've gotten over my disappointment in this not being more of an adventure game than it is, and I've played it quite a bit now.  I'm happy to say that I think this is a fantastic game.  I haven't played any of the Dominion expansions.  So, I won't compare, but Thunderstone has a lot more going on than vanilla Dominion.  Good stuff.

Original Comments:
==================
This has -just- enough of its own thing going on to call it more than a Dominion re-theme.  It's a fun, but personally disappointing game as I had hoped for a two-layered deck building system - one where you would have a very small (1-6 cards) hero deck comprising the adventuring party which would be persistent once played, and then a larger deck for hero items, actions, and special abilities.  Perhaps the heroes could be injured fighting monsters and have to be healed by a cleric, find a potion, or return to town.  Perhaps the heroes could encounter traps which a thief could disarm or even capture.  Alas, none of this is the case.  Thunderstone is Dominion except that you have to kill your VP cards, which is to say that you have to buy them with the game's second currency (attack) instead of gold.  It's a good game, which is a bit of a shame, because there was the potential for it to be great.  I'm still looking forward to the game that will truly take the Dominion deck building system to the next level.

A fantasy deck-building game sounded right up my alley, but I was pretty disappointed. An inordinate proportion of your time is dedicated to hand management. And then when you DO finally enter the dungeon, the combat itself is anticlimactic. I was expecting big things, but it just didn't deliver.

Thunderstone basically uses the same mechanics as Dominion. This game is just alot more theme based than Dominion. Now you buy equipment and heroes. You fight monsters and level up your heroes. Doesnt feel as smooth as Dominion, but its super fun. However I wouldnt suggest playing this with more than 3. The game time increases dramatically when adding more players.
Horrible index cards though, so if you start with this, please make sure to get the Wrath of the Elements expansion so you get better dividers for your cards.

Like the theme, like buiding a deck and going into the dungeon swinging.

Preliminary play with 5 players and the preset elemental setup. Turns are fairly short but the game itself took a long time. There didn't seem to be any creative plays to make on your turn as your hand very much dictates what you can do.

I think each of us would have preferred a little more deck manipulation, most took their fair share of the REST action which allows a player to discard one card.

Some of us thought there were not enough hero or weapon cards and that slowed down the building of a party strong to defeat any monster. 

Though we were all disappointed we all said we'd give the game another go to see if the first game was a fluke.

This game actually does something with the Dominion mechanics. Instead of simply buying cards, you could instead go kill a monster. Killing monsters gets you the points, but you need to build a good deck with stuff from the village as well. That's the main decision to make on each turn - buy something or kill something. Since the killing can be strictly calculated (and it is almost always better to net points when you can) , you might be able to argue that there is no decision to be made at all, but that would be cynical.

The decisions come into play when you go to the village - do you buy heroes, weapons, light, spells, and so on? The problem with the game is simply that the village cards are not that interesting. You are also limited to one purchase per turn, which often leaves you with a small pile of unspent cash. This is a game that was made for the expansions to liven things up, and boy does this game need them! On the plus side, I could see that a few good expansions could make a big difference.

UPDATE: Thunderstone Advance is slightly better, making this version extinct.

Initial comments: A very good game. For being a offspring of Dominion, I didn't feel its vibe during game play. With the dungeon element I was thinking more of Arctic Scavengers (where there is dynamic deck building and a static event deck). I can see that the dungeon deck could become a bit scripted with repeated plays (and the need for expansions, of course). Overall, I want to play again.

RATING: 4
This is a step in the right direction for the Dominion concept. It's still based on the fundamental idea that your hand represents buying power, but at least here there are multiple currencies / considerations. The theme is better developed. It takes twice as long as Dominion but I don't mind. 

I'd like to see a well-themed Dominion style game with hands that went beyond buying power, but maybe that's coming. 

Update: after a second play, I want to like it but find myself terribly bored by the pacing and put off by the dead, procedural nature of it. 

2nd Update: I'm not sure this is a step in the right direction for Dominion. Instead I think it shows how deeply unsatisfying Dominion's core mechanics and focus are. There's pretty much nothing about this I like. Not the theme, not the interaction, not the optimization, not the juggling of three purchasing powers. I'm not sure what this game is trying to capture or distill, but I'd rather just play a real game about character setups, party organization, battle tactics, money management, etc.

Rating based on one play.

I'm somewhat undecided on this one.  It isn't as balanced as Dominion, not by a long shot.  The same information/opportunities is not the same for each player each turn.  There were times when I would have been able to kill a monster but someone beat me to the punch.  Then when it was my turn the current available monsters weren't ones I could beat.  For the first half of the game I had bad luck which in turn made it impossible for me to win.

However, this game has a lot going for it.  The art work is great!  I would pick the art for Thunderstone over Dominion any day.  The theme is much better and is implemented better as well.  By contrast,dominion has one of the most tact on themes I've ever seen in a game.  The fun factor is higher in Thunderstone; It's exciting to level your heros up and see new monsters.  I get a better sense of progress with this game than I do Dominion.

So, I think Dominion as a whole is more balanced and is a more rewarding experience overall.  But Thunderstone can hold its own and I will gladly play again.

Update: I bumped the rating up to an 8.  Despite the luck factor of what monsters are available to fight when it's your turn (a factor that has caused me to lose every time) I keep comping back for more.  The game is more fun, has better art, and a better ambiance than dominion.  However, it still has prove itself to me before I claim this is the better game.

After my first couple of plays, I was very dissapointed with this game.  It took much longer for 3 of us to play than Dominion, and didn't seem to add much.  I really wanted to like this game, but I don't.

Outside of draw and discard effects, the game didn't really take advantage of the fact you were playing with cards, which is one of the things I like about Dominion.

Even after playing with the 1.4 rules, I thought this was a very mediocre game.  It didn't sound like any of my friends were really getting into it either.

I might try it again with the expansion, but I doubt if anyone in my group will bother to pick it up.

Wow.  It took the deck building ideas of Dominion and really took them to another level.  The game play and theme make a lot of sense when you are playing it.  The fact that your cards are both money and weapons or whatever is a real improvement.  And killing monsters is just fun.  

The one negative was that the rulebook could really use some improving.  We had a number of questions throughout the game which were simply not addressed in the rule book.

RATING: 5
I can see why some people would like this better than Dominion, as the monster/fantasy theme makes sense and is appealing to many.

This actually makes the game less attractive to me (though I don't necessarily care for Dominion's theme either), but the real spoiler here is the increased length of time it takes to play this compared to Dominion.  Perhaps this is an unfair way to evaluate it, but as the game is obviously inspired by Dominion, I think it is adequate to say that it is a little bloated.

It also feels more difficult to manage your deck.  There are few ways to churn through it, trashing cards is a pretty wasteful process, and after a few turns money is really no object.  This makes it feel like you are more dependent than ever on your hand that you draw each time.  I like that many of the monster cards help you (as opposed to the VP cards in Dominion), but it does seem that timing is very important, as the big point monsters are essential to have any hope of winning.  It also seems pretty powerful to get the Thunderstone.

Still, it is an entertaining alternative to Dominion that I wouldn't mind playing more to see if my opinion changes.

Wow, so disappointed with this game, I don't know where to begin. Rulebook was sorely lacking, no explanation of Magic Attack or normal Attacks (which is the basis for combat) and so much TERMINOLOGY left unanswered.

Gameplay was bad. I thought that a game borrowing off Dominion would be great, but Dominion has the advantage of simplicity. This game is a math exercise because of the constant light effect modifiers, each hand becomes a mental calculation of which monsters you can kill. SO MANY MODIFIERS! ARGGHHHH... 

I often complain that Dominion has no purpose. And I was really hoping that Thunderstone would be the perfect answer to that. Sadly it is not. It slows down a fast and elegant game and turns it into an AP grind.

Thunderstone can't avoid comparison to Dominion. It's much easier to start playing Dominion as to start Thunderstone. The concept of doing an action and buying a card with bought cards breaking these rules is in the end surprisingly lot simpler than choosing between fighting in dungeon or buying a card as you'll have to keep in mind lots more of minor details and the cards also tend to have more information in them. Thematically Thunderstone is stronger than Dominion having an rpg-feel to it instead of being just optimization of deck building. Biggest problem is that monsters aren't stacked in any way that often leads to breaking the flow of the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Slightly more complex than Dominion with most cards having more interaction with the game and more utility (most cards produce at least two of attack/strength/light/coin/victory points/special effect).  Also feels a lot more varied than Dominion.  A little tricky to intelligently randomize a board and takes longer to play.

Art that, while generic fantasy fare, isn't godawful (Dominion) is a nice plus.

A fantasy themed deck-building game where players compete to earn to most rewards. This game has some similar mechanics as those used in Dominion, but is certainly a unique game. Re-playability is very good, especially with the expansions. The game is themed well with nice artwork. It is engaging and each session is unique. The only thing I'd like to see more of is the ability for players to affect opposing players more often.

The Good: Plays pretty well solo - but you have to avoid using certain cards and that is a bummer. Multiple strategies to pick from each game makes one want to play just one more time. Card dividers are included - a nice touch. The implementation of the theme is just so-so for me, but the game-play makes up for it. Overall, I like this a lot more than Dominion.

The Bad: Takes longer than I hoped. My first solo game clocked in at 1 hour and 45 min. That did not include setup or teardown which is a bit of a chore with this game. Although I liked that card dividers were included, they were not very practical in actual use. I understand the expansion has solved this problem and for the base game as well. I am eager to get it. Should include solo rules in the box (there are some posted on BGG)

The Ugly: The rules were very poor in the area of helping a new player identify the cards. And there are TONS of cards in this game. Trying to sort thru the cards and figure out what is what is not for the faint of heart. In addition, the icons are difficult to understand. If you can find someone to teach you this game, it will help you avoid this Ugly.

Further update:  I dislike the fact that when going to the dungeon, it feels like I'm just going to "buy" a monster, it's not much different from going to the village.

Update:  I see the variety in the random decks plays a greater role in this game then in Dominion (without expansions).  The lack of light (except torches and some hereos) can really change the game and require a longer village buy-up run before parties are strong enough to take out the monsters with light penalites.

Also, although my son (10) understands the mechanics, he doesn't appear to grasp the strategies of hand management and appropriate card combos yet.  I hold back and allow him to take some monsters in the dungeons, which slows down the game as his deck isn't as strong as it should be.  This holds my rating down a little bit.

Initial rating based on a two-player game with the recommend starting decks.

A bit more complex and thematic then Dominion.  Starts slow, but after a while, the battles become sort of anti-climatic as you get more powerful.  It'll be interesting to see if this one gets more play than Dominion, which I know better from more plays.

I love card games, and Thunderstone crawls right up beside Dominion in my book. What could be cooler than creating an adventuring party in the form of a Deck!? 

However, the irritation to set it up and break it down due to the poor organization (especially compared to a game like Dominion) decreased how much we played it. I know this was fixed in the expansion, but I'm rating the game as it is, not as it would become. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The ambiguous icons are a definite weak point to the game.  Also, the village cards seem a lot less well-balanced than the kingdom cards in Dominion.  So, it's a decent game that I will rarely refuse to play, but I see no need to buy it or seek it out.

Like it more every time I get to play it! The decisions to me are fun and varied, the art is gorgeous, the rules are suprisingly simple (once you are used to the icons that seem too initially plentiful, they are no longer a hindrance at all), and I'm impressed at how so many different elements are so effectively juggled in the design. Sure, there's a bit of shuffling involved and it's pretty lucky, but drafting a successful deck is all about probabilities--at least you are trying to influence your chances, you know? Rather than some set probability die roll.

It's hard to get past the fact that this is a blatant Dominion ripoff, with no attempt to hide the fact. Other negatives include the artwork being too dark for my tastes, no easily visible differentiation between different types of cards, and the generic nameless dividers are too similar to the cards in both size and color, making setup and cleanup a bigger pain than it needs to be.

Having said all that, the game is enjoyable. Time will tell how it will compare to Dominion. I suspect the former still wins out for me, but for a blatant ripoff, it's not a bad one.

Thunderstone is a light dungeon crawl with cards.  It has heros, weapons, light sources, monsters, battle spoils, and magic.  Heros can become diseased, which impairs their combat ability until they rest. Heroes may also level up!  And, to make things really exciting, despite your heroes' best efforts, monsters occasionally escape the dungeon and wreck havoc. I simply love this deck building game.  The fact that my AP prone husband is able to execute his turn quickly is an added bonus.

Only played the facebook app but I like the strategies involved. Do you want o enter the dungeon and make some other monsters easier to fight for the otherss. Or do you want to upgrade your deck. Also you have to watch witch cards your opponents take. the banish rule is excellent

I think the facebook app AI is a bit weak since I won a four player game 27-5-4-4.

Anyway another good reason why publishers should'nt avoid electronical versions. Now I want to have the boardgame. Before it crossed my mind but dominion doesn't get played. so I didn't see the use for this  one.  

Edit: acquired the boardgame with expansion and a promo.
there is a lot of upkeep in it. And  with two it doesn't move along at a good pace. Probably best with three.
Big difference with ascension is the light limitation in fights and that you don't have constructs. so your combo's are smaller.
. Hence I lowered my rating to a 7.

In general, I prefer the theme to dominion. If makes more sense for me that either you accumulate stuff at the village to beef up your deck or either adventure yourself in the dungeon.

One of the thing that makes thunderstone better is that each card has a double function (combat or gold). So you do not end up with dead cards in your hand like with the estate card in dominion

Now the problem with this game is that there are a few annoying things that does not make the game that good and compelling to play again.

First, the iconography and the placement of the value on the cards are very confusion. It's very hard to identify what is what and you are always searching information on the card. Some information are on the text box, so some times you need to move your cards in your hand to see what you have.

There are monsters of different strength in the deck, but there are no monster sorting. So we end up in a situation where a strong monster showed up first making sure that nobody could kill it and forcing player to simply beef up their deck. Personally, they should sort the monster strength.

Another suggestion for dungeon exploration is the lack of surprise. I would have preferred a game with 3 deck of cards for each level and when you explore, you select your level and draw a card. This way, you do not know if you are actually going to win. Entering a dungeon should be scary, if you see what you are going to fight, that makes the feeling completely go away.

When you defeat a monsters you gain EXP card that has the only function of being spend for level up. I don't find this very elegant. I would have either used tokens or a track instead of cards. Else, I would have made that each monster in your hand are worth XP that you can use for level up.

Leveling up heroes is hard and useless. Because player can buy leveled up heroes and prevent up from leveling up your cards because there are no more leveled up cards in play. So it's a bit annoying to give you all the trouble to level up your character when you can simply buy it at an higher level.

Resting is very weak. Losing 1 turn to discard 1 card is very a weak action and should not be done at all. I suggest either allowing player to discard 2 cards or multiple cards from their hands.

The way the game ends is also not that interesting. Of course the game has to end, but I would prefer having something like a quest (which could change on each game). Players would need to go deep in the dungeon to find or do something. When it's done the game ends. 

So again it's the idea of "do I think I am strong enough to do it?" which is a feeling completely missing from the game that should have been placed in priority.

I guess this is the 2nd new game of the post-Magic "deck-building genre".  This is "Dominion Dungeon Crawler" and I really think that this fantasy theme fits deck-building better than Dominion (but nothing against Dominion's theme at all, just that it is abstract).  The former D&D and RPG'er in me really loves the leveling-up through experience points aspect of Heroes.  I also believe that Thunderstone's base game has more variety than Dominion's base game.  There are some tweaks or house variants you can use to customize to your group's opinions and tastes.

RATING: 7
Hmmmmmm....not sure what to think after my first play.  Dominion feels much more simple and expandable with a much better flow to the game despite the greater theme felt in Thunderstone.  There is definitely a lot of similarity except you now have to choose between attacking in a dungeon or buying a new card/upgrade a hero in Thunderstone so you cannot do everything as in Dominion.  Thunderstone felt a bit clunky, prep time is even longer than Dominion, and cleanup isn't fun either AND the game takes longer in most cases as well.  All in all, I'm happy to just keep playing Dominion.
====================================================
After five plays, I can say I'm happy to have the game in my collection.  It still feels quite clunky in comparison to Dominion's smooth play, but the theme, leveling up of heroes, and the dungeon conquest aspect appeals to me.  I've upped the rating to 7 at this point.

Currently my favorite of the card based games (well other than the MTG.  Fast, easy, but if you get a bad drawn on the random feed you need to just re-random or modify the cards some to make the game fun. Played about 8x as of 2/4/2011.

I have only played the solo version so far, and I definitely want to play this with opponents. I think I much prefer Arcana for the direct player interaction the game offers, but this game is definitely interesting. The card combinations can be fun, and the game presents you with some difficult choices. The variability in the game is just great, and something that I wish other games had. Overall another great game from AEG. 

[u]Comments Update:[/u]
After playing many many many games of Thunderstone I have to say that it is the best Deck Building Game out there that I have played. While I enjoy Arcana more, I would classify that more as a trick tacking game with a deck building facade. Thunderstone has continued to impress with me with each expansion, and with each new expansion I find more reasons why I love the game. Thunderstone still can't be be beat for solo play, but the multiplayer game is just as much fun, if not more fun. I even won the Thunderstone tournament at Gencon 2011. 

[u]Comments Update Update:[/u]
Stick a fork in Thunderstone, and all other deck building games for that matter. Too repetitive, too boring, and to be honest I am just sick of them. Thunderstone was definitely my absolute favorite of the lot, but the whole genre really has been spoiled for me. Sorry Thunderstone, we have had some good times, you and I, but you just aren't what I am looking for anymore in a game. It's not you, really, it's me. I hope we can still be friends.

Very good deck building card game HEAVILY influenced by the mechanics of Dominion.  I enjoy the light dungeon delving theme (although it is primarily a mathy optimization game at its core).

This is a much better deck building game than Dominion. However the base set needs expansions in order for it to be more interesting. And then again, I've yet to play Dominion with its expansions.

Certainly not hiding it's Dominion influenced play, nor it's D&D roots, Thunderstone is VERY good. It's also very easy on the eyes.

Anyone not wanting to play a more richly themed more objective based Dominion with a 60 minute play time stay away.

Gameplay is about recognizing what monsters there are, what tools you have available and what combination will work best to defeat them. It's familiar but not. 

I'm truly looking forward to more plays and any expansions this will have.

Additional expansions slow this game down to a crawl making it a shadow of what the base game promised.

Deck building game where you are acquiring adventurers, weapons, spells, etc to then go to the Dungeon and defeat monsters for points.  Very run game with a lot of interesting choices and big improvement on Dominion.  

The only issue with the same is that it can stall.  There can be monsters which are so tough to defeat in combination, you have to get an almost perfect hand to be successful.  You are constantly resting to get the perfect hand.  But this happens occasionally and for the most part this is pretty fun.  

Thunderstone Advance is the better game, but this can be played with it.  Artwork is better in this version than the Advance game.

RATING: 6.8
My playgroup calls this "Dominion with a purpose". Some of us actually find it to be more fun than Dominion due to the thematic elements and because it seems much harder to fall far behind as a result of synergistic combos. Players tend to score points in smaller increments and so I've found that players rarely feel as if they've "already lost" halfway through the game. Unlike Dominion the base set has few mechanics to promote interactivity between players, but the expansions overcome this minor quibble.

RATING: 5
In our (okay, my) quest to find something that my wife and I can play and that scales up for more, we (okay, I) decided to try something different. We'd been moving away from board games with cubes and tokens towards more card-heavy games: At the [i]Gates of Loyang[/i] to [i]Jambo[/i] to [i]Glory to Rome[/i]. So what about one of those deck-building games?  Well after a number of games with my wife, [i]Thunderstone[/i]'s got a pass from the both of us. There could be a little more interaction between players - at this point, it's just discard one card if the other player takes a 2nd or 3rd level thief into the dungeon. Not a real stab-in-the-back kind of move. I'm sure our decks get too bloated with low level cards - but we'd rather buy a new weapon and level up than "waste" a turn resting. It's not a high tension game - we don't count each other's victory points as they go into our decks so neither of us have a good idea of who is winning and how close it is. In fact, the game is quite cooperative as we help each other optimize our hands...although now if one of us declares that they are going to the dungeon, they aren't allowed to change your mind when we discover that they miscounted their attack or light factors. All in all, this game works as a two player game and it works with a third player as well.

"Don't buy this game if" review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/516171/dont-buy-this-game-if-5-thundesrtone

Moves a lot slower than Dominion.
Definitely more thematic than Dominion and more depth v-v VPs and strategy. This, in and of itself, would make it a less wife-friendly game. 

Cards have multiple icons which make it a little more difficult to follow. Students could easily pick up these.

Game does get favorable ratings.

Heavy fantasy theme and therefore not as appealing for wives or girlfriends.

See "Don't buy this game if -" review.

THIS REVIEW REALLY MAKES IT A "LOVE TO HAVE": http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/579011/so-you-love-dominion-will-you-also-love-thundersto
-- the idea of using money to buy stuff that is then used towards achieving a goal (i.e., killing dragons) which ultimately gives you the victory points, is something that could take the "race for 8 gold" feeling out of basic dominion. It appears, however, that the expansions for dominion (i.e., Intrigue which offers more interaction, and Prosperity which offers more routes to obtaining VPs) could be redeeming for Dominion. Nevertheless, Thunderstone seems like a game very much worth having.

11/2010 An excellent deckbuilding game.  The production is outstanding; solid fantasy theme with lush consistant graphics.  Mechanics are comparable to Dominion though more entertaining.

9/2011 Several games - especially with randomly selected cards - turn out strange where the cards just doesn't fit together.  The game will drag to an end at some point, but it isn't any fun if it's not possible to develop the necessary group of monster-bashing heroes.  Rating down 9->8.

Variation of Dominion which I enjoyed much compared with Dominion. The differences mainly lies n the theme: Thunderstone is dripping with theme while Dominion is just an abstract game (which I hate playing in general) dressed with medieval theme. Some maybe driven back by the amount of luck in this game, which, I think, makes less skillful/ knowledgeable players have a chance to win against a game with veterans. (which is impossible in Dominion)

I really wanted to like this game.  I love Dominion, but this just has a lot of theme and no actual game play from what I can tell.  So much of the same thing over and over again.  I know some will say the same thing with Dominion, but I feel like I;m actually doing something with that game.  I just feel like you get dealt so much random stuff at the start of the game that you get a lot of combos that jusst don't work.

Got this in the Origins 2013 Math Trade, but without its box, just everything in the first expansion's box, plus the original instruction booklet that doesn't fit in the latter box (the base game box must have been bigger dimensions).

The rules and explanations are clunky in areas, and sometimes not clarified on specific situations.  I gave this and the two expansions to Johnny since that group seems to enjoy it (even Jackie, too), but I've got enough choices of the deckbuilding flavor to play that I'd enjoy more anyways.

Deck building done wrong. Here it's just used as a way to create randomness in a messy, fiddly, unthematic and vastly overlong game. 
With no real trashing, card drawing, etc abilities as per Dominion, you just draw cards and hope the right ones come together at the same time the right monster turns up. They may have well skipped the deckbuilding and just had you roll dice.

The absolute best deck building game available, Thunderstone wipes the floor with Dominion and its paper thin theme and 30 minute play. Thunderstone provides an outstanding theme, a nice play time (60-120 minutes) and is also highly customizable. Terrible rule book, it must be introduced by a veteran player if possible, and the monsters in the base game are too weak. It's also a shame that the card dividers provided on this set are so lame, anyone who owns it should buy Wrath of the Elements to rectify that.

Thunderstone is definitely a decent fantasy DBG. You get a heck of a lot of cards for the price, though I've come to find that I really don't end up playing most of them. Some of the gameplay mechanics feel unnecessary (Villagers in particular) and just don't get used by myself or my friends. Personally, I would suggest ignoring this baseset and going for one of the others, especially the Thunderstone Advanced set. They feature more refined cards and higher quality components as well. They also mix and match with older sets just fine.

Es un juego basado en armar con las cartas un buen grupo de héroes, mercenarios,aliados,hechizos y armas lo suficientemente fuerte para combatir los monstruos del laberinto .El batallón y la estrategia se van armando a medida que se reúne el oro necesario para adquirirlos. Se debe anunciar en cada turno si se viaja a la ciudad para adquirir armas y aliados o si se opta por el combate en el laberinto. Hay que tener en cuenta, la fuerza y la capacidad defensiva de los  monstruos  antes de atacar. Y por cada batalla favorable se recibirá como trofeo el enemigo y su valor se convertirá en puntos de victoria que al final definirán el ganador del juego.

I love Dominion.  That being said, Thunderstone takes the deck building genre to the next level.  The addition of the dungeon and the monsters and heroes makes each hand exciting.

The theme is absolutely fantastic for this wonderfully enjoyable game!

I knew Dominion first, so this game, to me, is a Dominion clone.  I like the theming of this game, gathering up an adventuring party in the Village, and then heading into the Dungeon to do battle with the creatures. The strategy seems rather simplistic compared to Dominion though.  I'd need to play a bit more to know for certain, having only really played with the starting setup so far.

Added to my collection in February 2010. First played in March 2010.

A fun game, but not quite up to the excellence that is Dominion. I enjoyed the games that I have played and can see that with more players and more cards that this could evolve into a good game.

I don't feel that it is a 'great' game in the way that I think Dominion is though. However, people I have played the game with really enjoy it so maybe I'm just being a bit snobby.

RATING: 5
Thunderstone clearly and undeniably rips off Dominion, which need not have been a bad thing. Indeed, some of the innovations it introduces, like the level advancement of heroes and the decoupled gold/attack currency show the promise of a well-done Dungeoncrawl Dominion. Even the clunkiness of the light mechanic would have been forgiveable, and I'm enough of a fantasy buff that I'd happily play some more couples of rounds of Thunderstone, provided that there's not a copy of Dominion nearby.

Where it fails, and fails hugely, is in its theme and atmosphere, the one area that it certainly should have improved upon its parent game. It begins with the central question of any adventure game that wants to be atmospheric: Who am I? I'm clearly not one of the adventuring heroes, since they are there for me to hire and equip. On the other hand, I can throw some mean fireballs all on my own without any help. Where's the sense in this? Is this meant to portray a world where questing heroes have some kind of tour manager with back-up Pyromancy skills?

This lack of consistent theming, along with the abysmal iconography, will make this game a sure dud with anyone not intimately acquainted with all the fantasy clichés from RPGs and (especially) computer games. In summary, Thunderstone is a merely good game on the shoulders of a great game, and that is just not good enough.

Wow, it's almost like a game company sat down and said, "Gee, this Dominion thing sure is making a lot of money, we should get in on that... but we need to have our own twist...  I know, a dungeon crawl."

While not bad in and of itself, it does seem a lot like a Dominion act-alike.  It makes me worry that we'll see a lot more of these in the next few years, kind of like the way Magic: The Gathering spawned a huge number of unsustainable CCGs in the '90s.

Take dominion... sprinkle in extra complexity after extra complexity until all of the rhythm and elegance are stripped away.  The more deck building games that come out that are superior (puzzle strike, nightfall), the less I want to play this game.

Be sure to download the updated rules--v 1.4.  And maybe a player aid to clarify turn order.  Beautiful card art, deck-building is always fun, I like the way the cards work together.  It's like D&D meets Dominion.  Can be frustrating to learn, as you muddle through the incorrect rulebook and unclear card language.  But once you figure it all out, very fun to play.  Almost as addictive as Dominion.

As the box says, deck building with a purpose. Very fun game. Similar to Dominion but instead of buying victory points you enter a dungeon and battle beasts in search of the ThunderStone. I really enjoy this game. I have had some trouble finding people to play with. As soon as I say dungeon, everyone says oh like D&D? NOOO! Not like D&D at all. Very fun game and I would recommend it, especially if you like deck building games.
I will count plays with expansions under this heading.

I wanted to like this more, but three things drag it down: dead or boring turns, of which there were many; the terrible graphic design of the cards themselves; and the level of fiddliness for what it is, which was too high and didn't offer much in return.

It does a better job integrating theme than Dominion, and the card art is excellent. The concept is also great, and right up my alley -- it just didn't deliver enough to make me want to go back for more.

RATING: 7.5
A very good and thematic take on the Dominion mechanism with integrated remodeling and deck reduction. 

If you want to go to the dungeon, you need a little more luck because a right mix between weapons / heroes (or sometimes between Magic Attack / Attack) is required. However, a bad dungeon hand always almost means you have good Village hand and can buy something useful and there's always the rest option if your hand plainly sucks.

Thunderstone does take longer to play than Dominion, though.

The best deck building game I have ever played (not including the dice game Quarriors!). It gives a purpose for the deck building mechanic and it's also fairly easy to mod to make more games out of it. The only problem in the game is the AWFUL card layout: it takes a while to understand what means what and where is it in the card.

This game gets better and better the more I play it!  I received this one for my birthday and at the moment it is the only game that I have interest in playing. I think that my friends are getting hooked on it too which can only mean more plays for me!!  One of the problems I have with this game is that I am having a difficult time developing strategies with the cards.  Hopefully this will be a problem that goes away with time.  The other consistent negative comment that players have is that the icons on the cards feel inconsistent and vague.  Its not a problem that makes the game unplayable but definitely slows down the learning process.

I didn't think I would like Thunderstone when it first came out.  It sounded like the kind of thing my wife wouldn't like (the way monsters work) and I already had a bunch of Dominion languishing (although I like Dominion a lot too).  Anyhow, I finally picked up the ipad version of Thunderstone and WOW! It's really fun!  I like that I'm having to work hard to play well and there is certainly a lot more to think about than in Dominion.  That said, I'm not sure I'd actually like the card version of the game.  There is enough math between figuring out attacke/light/monster row that I think it'd be too much trouble but, on the iPad, that's all taken care of.

First of all, if you're going to clone a game (Dominion in this case), add something that is at least better.  Thunderstone does not do this.  The games are longer than Dominion but a lot more tedious.  You have to pretty much incorporate home tweaks to make it better.  Even if you don't, you have to use an intelligent randomizer to insure you don't waste the next 1.5-2 hours of your life.  The later expansions of Thunderstone clearly tried to fix this as they introduced a lot more cards usable in the Village AND Dungeon.  Still, the strategy is lacking in depth, and the games still last a while.  Maybe computerized versions will improve this game.

Deckbuilder. Slightly more into it than Dominion. This has three currencies to count on your cards: besides money to buy more cards, you need to count "attack power" and "lights." Basically this turns into an exercise of counting icons. Sometimes you have enough to buy a hero or some sort of weapon, sometimes you can defeat a monster in the dungeon. That is basically it. Almost no interaction, a rather solitary and repetitive affair. Maybe this game is more for players that are into the theme very much. I don't care for the theme. At the end of the day it comes down to just counting icons and see what you can do. Disappointing.

Not as elegant as Dominion; not as much fun as Ascension. Excellent component quality can't make up for the game's shortcomings: it runs too long; options can be limited by an inflexible deal of decks; it's fiddly. I'm not Dominion's greatest fan, but it plays pretty straightforwardly with most deck combinations. Though this is not a bad game, I can't see why you'd want this in preference to the myriad other deck-builders out there.

As I observed it's mandatory to mention in the comments the word [i]'Dominion'[/i] for some reason. Sadly(?) I haven't got the faintest idea what to do with it since I've never played that one, so I can't compare to it.
Judging on it's own merits Thunderstone is an exciting deck-building card game with a strong theme, plays fast with little downtime. The base cards give quite a variety, but it won't last long I guess, however it's pretty obvious that there are at least half a dozen expansions in the queue.

Very popular with my kids - really, it's one of the funnest games we have together.

I certainly appreciate that this bring more theme to deck building vs. Dominion, and leveling up your characters is a great mechanism.

Game in a Nutshell: A deck-building game of gathering a party of monster fighting heroes, weapons, and spells then take them into the dungeon to slay the biggest monsters.

Played as: 2 player (Yucata.de only)

Pros: The game does such a good job of theme integration, especially given its very un-thematic main mechanic (deck-building). I like the transition from preparing a party in the village to getting in the dungeon to see how it stacks up. Being able to level-up your Heroes is a personal favorite point. At first I thought there should be a tiny bit more variety in the base set but it still hasn't grown stale for me in the dozens of plays I've had so far.

Cons: This being the first version of this "system" with so many changes and rule tweaks being made in future versions, it's safe to say this, the original, is less refined: The cat and mouse game for the thunderstone card seems to guarantee an anti-climactic ending; the randomness of the monsters available to fight can lead to some brutally hard beginnings and boring conclusions; and so on. Most of this has been addressed by future releases within the series. What hasn't, is some iconography that is laid out with no apparent structure, rhyme or reason and all the "count this, add that, now double, subtract, factor out for another..." stuff that makes it tough not to makes mistakes or oversights (which I still do too frequently after 20+ games). 

Other: Having not played a physical copy of the game, I wonder if things would start to drag on when there isn't a computer doing the book-keeping for quicker reference. Also, I've not played any expansions or later releases, so I can't really vouch for how this game compares to future changes beyond what I know of the rules.

Best Use: A deck-building game for those who complain they lack theme.

Something's just bothering me about this game. Maybe there's just not enough tension? I really need to read the rules again (which are sub-par) and give the game a few more tries to decide how I really feel. I want to enjoy this game, however it also feels that for what decisions and actions you perform in this game, the game is rather long. Starting to feel that I definitely prefer Dominion even if it has a pasted on theme. How I feel gameplay > theme.

While still a good game, and one I invested heavily in, it has many problems that are fixed with the Advance release.

I like the theme, and what the game is going for. My biggest gripe is that both games I've played have ventured close to the 3 hour mark (with instructions). I think it just takes too long to get going. I never feel like I get good combos out. Just buy buy buy until I finally have enough swords to attack monsters. Plus, you kind of have to buy everything because some monsters have requirements that can't be met otherwise. So everyone's decks kind of feel similar in the end. I hate comparing it to Dominion because it is its own game, but I kind of like Dominion more. Which might be ok if I loved Dominion, but I don't. Dominion is kind of dry for me. Maybe I just don't love the deck-building, hope-you-draw-what-you-bought-on-same-turn mechanic. In Thunderstone's case, I think I'd rather play a good ole-fashion RPG board game in the same time frame instead.

I enjoy the deck-building mechanic, and the fact that you need to respond to changing conditions in the dungeon makes it more interesting.  Unfortunately, the game seems like it could have used more playtesting and balancing.  The mechanic that awards the Thunderstone (and its VP) to the player after you can really stall the game end.  Five player games have real problems with Hero availability.  Some of the Hero classes are near useless while others are overpowered. The rules were revised four times in the first month after release...

Even so, I find it enjoyable for the experience if not for the tightly crafted gameplay.  Here's hoping that the expansions can significantly improve on the base game.

Yes, it's Dominion the Dungeon Crawl.  What you get is a game that has a much more defined theme but less decisions to make overall.  The decks tend not interact with each other too much and it can seem a bit stiff because you're really only usually doing one thing on your turn (attacking, fighting or purging).  All the card movement in Dominion makes it look like you're doing so much more but the reality is that you're usually just spewing cards til you can purchase something. Dominion has more deck-building, you really need a solid engine to compete.  That being said it is a different game and with a few plays under your belt you can begin to see some of its merits.  I would say many of the low ratings are due to people who don't really understand the underlying strategies.  Enjoy playing and each new expansion seems to add more flexibility and challenge.  I also like how the clock works in Thunderstone -- you can't be too patient as you really need to get in there eventually and start defeating monsters, to gain the XP to power your deck further. 2012-09-12

UPDATE: Played in person for the 1st time and it really seemed to drag on and on. I do like it online but face-to-face this is a huge problem. Bumping rating down a point. 2012-12-11

yeah, it's kinda klunky. like, I get the feeling that there are three monsters face-up because the first time they tried it out, it was with three monsters face up.

Pakli építgetős játék.
Minden kör végén húzunk 6 lapot a saját húzó paklinkból; ezekkel játsszuk majd le a következő körünket, melyben: várost járhatunk, vagyis fegyverekkel, varázslatokkal, egyéb felszereléssel és nem utolsó sorban hősökkel erősítjük a paklinkat; vagy szörnyekre vadászhatunk a kazamatákban. 
Félve szereztem be ezt a játékot, mivel a Dominion nem igazán jött be, ezt a játékot viszont úgy reklámozták, hogy lényegében egy fantasy témájú Dominion. 
Tényleg nagy a hasonlóság a 2 játék között, az alapmechanizmus szinte ugyanaz. Ha különbséget kellene találni, akkor elsőre azt mondanám, hogy ebben talán kevesebbet lehet kombózni a kártyákkal, nincs az a zavaró érzésem, mint ami a Dominionnál volt, hogy egymás után sorban játszottam ki a lapokat, és a végén már alig tudtam követni, hogy hány akcióm, vagy aranyam is van még/már összesen. Egy másik dolog, ami még a játék javára írható, az a nagyon erős téma, ami lényegében minden egyes kártyalapban visszaköszön.

I don't get it. It's Dominion, plus monsters, minus the smooth engine. Experience, leveling, familiars, monsters, light, all of these mechanisms feel tacked on to make it feel like a dungeon crawl ("thematic parity") as opposed to enhance gameply. You can't build an effective engine because there aren't enough of any of the useful cards to create consistent draws. Taking an experience strategy? Sure, you earned that XP but your level 1 dude can't level up because somewhat bought the last level 2. What?

And the tactical decisions? If you draw money, you go to the village. If you draw attack, you go to the dungeon. You attack the highest monster you can beat. Auto-pilot, go take a nap. Any chance your attack might fail? Only if you fail single-digit arithmetic. Any tension? No.

There are lots of interesting uses of deckbuilding out there. I'm not a Dominion purist. But this game *is* Dominion with a theme makeover that left it like a plastic surgery gone wrong. There's nothing attractive here.

You draw random cards, you add them up, if it's enough to kill a monster, you do that. If not, you buy a new card for the deck to draw randomly from.
That's it.
Worst of all, no interaction between players. None. (Ok, rarely you can be a very mild nuissance)
Why do I give five points? Its a nice theme, if generic, and it is generally liked by wives and family (chauvinist alert), because there is no confrontation, no attacking for fun and profit.
It's the "farmville" of boardgames. Okay, now I am just mean.

This game is extremely similar to Dominion (and came out a year after it, so is likely a copy); players start out with a deck of identical cards, and then use those cards to either buy new cards or attack monsters (to get victory points).  Unlike in dominion, there is actually fighting in this game: players use the six cards in their hands (heroes, weapons, magic spells, and accessories) to build a party to storm the dungeon, trying to kill one of three monsters currently available to slay.

There are many combinations players can attempt to build, but there aren't nearly as many chaining combos as Dominion (which is nice).  Players earn victory points for slaying monsters, and also get experience points, with which they can upgrade their fighters.

One thing my group has found odd is that the monsters that come out in the dungeon are not scaled with time.  Thus, at the end of the game, when your deck is finally giving you the combos you want, you may still be fighting a monster that can be killed with your start deck.  And, of course, you can get a super-duper-difficult monster right at the start of the game, which you have no hope of killing.  This leads to a lack of feeling of progress in the game, and some anti-climatic finishes ("oooh, this is the last monster; oh, wait, it only has 2 hit points?  Anyone can kill it!").  

Overall this is an okay game, but the setup time is tremendous (16+ separate piles of cards need to be made), and it doesn't feel as smooth or progressive as Dominion.  However, it lacks Dominion's annoying chaining card combos, which is nice.

I'm not so down on this as its grown on meto a degree.
The theme is ok but the luck element can be frustrating which is a problem with deck builders. Get the wrong hands and you spend way too much time in the Village and not enough time dealing with monsters. The end game can be a real problem. It would be better if this was a shorter game. Probably best with 2 players.

RATING: 7.5
Less mathy and clever than Dominion, but the theme is much more a part of the game, and the game seems looser and more fun. So far the 3 people I've shown the game prefer it to Dominion. I don't feel the same, but it's at least a nice  alternative. The games are different enough to warrant having both.

It bothers me a bit that the solo game didn't really feel any different from the normal game. I'm not sure why. The solo game might be the best use of Thunderstone.

I've had games where all the strong monsters come out early and the game slows to a crawl unless players start wasting their turns fighting losing battles and sending the tough monsters to the bottom of the deck (and who wants to do that?) Thunderstone is very fun when it works, and very frustrating when it doesn't.

Sold in BGG auction, need to take this to Gen Con for delivery.

Aaaaaand reacquired with a vengeance. Kat missed it, as did the folks I play with on Wednesdays. I used the proceeds from by BGG auction to get this with all available expansions. Upon replaying it with expansions, it's very fun despite some imperfections. This might be my first guilty pleasure game.

Aaaaaand got rid of it again. Ascension took its place as a lighter deckbuilder. I then got rid of Ascension when I realized that I don't NEED to have a light deckbuilding game in my collection. Also, the Ascension iOS app is wonderful.

RATING: 8
A pretty good game that seems to be missing something. It moves too slowly at first (usually just one buy per turn in the village) then suddenly you're defeating monsters every turn. The rule for capturing the thunderstone to end the game seems flawed. Maybe I just need to play more, and I definitely will. Here's hoping the expansion makes it more interesting.

Update 1: Starting to acclimate to the slow pace, patiently building my deck more judiciously. Getting rid of a card while "resting" now and then is far from a wasted turn. I still wish you could routinely buy more than one thing per turn in the village. The Wrath expansion very good, fixing the endgame and adding some interesting monsters, especially the increasingly imposing Horde and the tough-hided Golems. Also, the solo game (especially the second, "warrior" level) is nicely challenging and works well. Not sure the traps and guardian add much more than randomness to the game; need to try them more (only one guardian in the Wrath expansion--disappointing and a bit chintzy). The best thing about the expansion however is the new, smaller box with well-designed dividers for the base game and Wrath expansion and plenty of room for future expansions.

Update 2: Bumped my rating up a point for how well the  solo option works; very satisfying. Also for some nice extras (treasures!) in the Doomgate Legion expansion.  [51 plays: 8 two-player, 43 solo]

Played for the first time last night. Will have to play a few more times before I can be sure if I will really come to love Thunderstone but the first game was lots of fun once we figured out what was going on. 

Everyone compares it to Dominion and I see the resemblance but this game has more appeal to me than Dominion simply because every turn I feel like I can actually do something and the pace seems quicker.

lots of fun (similar to dominion) - pick hand, use hand to either go in the dungeon and "fight" a monster or gear up your deck by shopping or training.

A semi-abstract dungeon crawl. Plays a lot like Dominion but with more structure (and less real choice).

It seems that one always begins by building up in the village/town and the real trick of the game is knowing when to hit the dungeon. A number of expansions suggests replayability, but I am not sure I see this.

Nice components, but just did not work for me.

主題:1
主題強烈的RPG式DOMI型卡牌遊戲，套用練英雄升級及地下城打怪的電動玩具模式，來進行domi類團體對抗系統的遊戲，主題還蠻能切合遊戲過程，例如進村莊補給，進地下城打怪。

美術:0.7
卡牌精美，有形形色色的英雄人物，各式各樣的怪物及大魔頭，看本遊戲的卡牌也是一種享受遊戲的過程。不過美術表現上也只能呈現在卡牌上，本項分數也無法滿分。

規則:0.7
規則如同一般domi類型遊戲，先拿12張基本手牌，在遊玩過程中藉由進村莊購買手牌來建立自己的牌庫，進地下城打怪拿分數，規則合情合理沒有太多瑕疵，不過最遊戲中最令人麻煩的還是結算打怪的戰力計算，計算本回合的戰力過程中會令人感覺疲憊，又要加力量持武器，又要加照明度加減燈光懲罰，有時光計算戰力的時間，又讓其他等的玩家覺得不耐煩，不像皇輿爭霸那樣來的令人直觀好計算。  

設置:0.3 
   這次本遊戲最令我詬病之處，domi類的遊戲最麻煩的地方就是擺設卡片，始祖皇輿爭霸已經夠麻煩了，後起之秀雷霆之石不惶多讓更加麻煩好幾倍。
   皇輿爭霸的擺設說實在，玩久熟了都還好，金幣3種、行動卡10種，分數卡3種基本上都很好擺設。雷霆之石還要設定地下城牌庫，先挑出三種怪，有時要加入陷阱卡、守護者卡，洗成地下城牌庫。這是麻煩一。
   皇輿爭霸的行動卡10種挑好就可以擺設，雷霆之石的行動卡，還要細分成英雄四種類型，每一個英雄牌組還要照1.2.3等級排好，另外村莊又分物品兩種武器兩種法術2種，村民傭兵3種。光將村莊牌庫組好，又要花一大段時間，難怪遊戲一直不好推廣，因為擺設過程就嚇跑一堆人，比規則還難搞懂!

路線:0.8
   遊戲過程中，要依據地下城怪物的特性及村莊的英雄武器法術類別，來組成最佳化的個人團隊，路線不可謂不夠廣。本遊戲充滿RPG元素，例如要走騎士，還是法師或是盜匪...等。例外有許多大大小小的擴充，絕對讓本遊戲充滿變化。

互動:0.4
   本遊戲的玩家互動，也是令我覺得詬病的地方，基本上我還比較喜歡將這個遊戲當作單機遊戲來玩，多人場很遺憾沒有玩到幾場，所以評分上會比較主觀一點。本遊戲系統就是玩家一起對抗地下城怪物，在打怪的過程中，看看誰比較神勇打的怪比較多比較高分，過程中偶有一些行動牌可以玩家互相對抗，但也僅僅是雞肋。玩家真能感受到互動的感覺還真的不多。
   此外，個別玩家的牌庫組成，因為面對的怪物及村莊行動牌都一樣，常常會變成我做甚麼，他就做甚麼的情形產生，不像皇輿爭霸一樣，每個人面對的是其他玩家不是遊戲系統，玩家的互動真的比較直接。另外打法上每個玩家的取捨點也比雷霆之石多一點。
   
個人:0.9
   本遊戲最令我欣賞的一點就是單人可以打很爽的桌遊。遊戲規則也很多變化，外加擴充多，不同的怪物模組，對抗不同性質的英雄，都可以讓我在單人遊戲中享受打怪的樂趣，唯一要扣分的是設置太複雜，讓我開的機會比不上皇輿爭霸。

朋友:0.5
   玩不多次，但朋友也覺得沒有皇輿爭霸有趣，我猜跟打怪算分有點複雜有關。畢竟每打怪一次就等於解數學習題一題一樣煩人。

想玩:0.6
   最近單人遊戲有越收越多的趨勢，可能會先開別款，不過有時想練功打怪享受被怪物虐殺的快感時，會想開一下這款，不過面對惱人的設置作業，又會打退堂鼓。

收藏:0.8
   做為我收過的第二款domi類遊戲，有著與眾不同的電玩風格，加上又是中文版遊戲，後續又有一堆中文化擴充，對於這個坑，還是跳了下去，本遊戲還是有它的樂趣存在，尤其是做為單人遊戲。 

總分:6.7

講評:
打完分數後，對於這款大作，我的評分竟然只有6.7分，我自己也嚇了一跳。本遊戲出的擴充不比皇輿爭霸少，我開的次數卻少於皇輿。推究其原因，不是遊戲不好玩，而是設置太麻煩，計算打怪過程太複雜，都是讓人望之卻步的地方，但要是有愛的話，本遊戲倒不失為一款有趣的遊戲。

This game seems to try to be a bit like Dominion where players essentially assault a dungeon rather than try to buy up the most land.

Je ne peux m'empêcher de le comparer à Dominion, et plusieurs éléments jouent en sa défaveur: le thème ne m'inspire pas autant; les couleurs sont beaucoup trop sombres et les cartes se ressemblent beaucoup vues de loin, ce qui nuit à la lisibilité (d'autant plus que des fighters d'une même classe ont la même image, et ce qui distingue leur niveau n'est pas si apparant au premier coup d'oeil)...

Mais aussi, je pense que je ne suis pas fou à l'idée que les cartes valant des points ne sont pas toujours accessibles, ce qui rend le timing particulièrement important... et cruel.

RATING: 7
Love the artwork, brilliantly produced card game.  Got the version 1.4 rules so no complaints there really.  Fun solo too.  So good it makes me want to try Dominion out!

One of the best deck-builders available, although I don't think I'll be jumping on the expansion band wagon with this.  Also takes a long time to get all the decks shuffled and set up.

UPDATE 15/02/14:

I love the art style for this game, love it.  I really like the idea of light and its impact on the different levels of the dungeon, but I think it’s poorly executed.  It’s just basic maths at the end of the day, but it detracts a lot from what you’re doing whilst you’re working it out, even after a few plays, and there’s so much adding and subtracting that you really get less of a feel of dungeon exploring, which is ostensibly what this game is.  I hear they’ve tightened this up in the new edition, but I’m not really interested in re-buying the game again.

However, as a light deck builder, this passes the time nicely.  The random setups give tons of replayability, but can deliver some occasionally very odd gaming combos.  This particular session we ended up with only really high cost heroes in the line up, which meant it took us longer to get going, but then we beasted through the dungeons more quickly once we were up and running.  The pace was pretty even, though it felt like Sam was dominating for the most part, levelling up his heroes more often than I was.  But all those extra village visits would be his undoing as I just kept chipping away at all the monsters, and eventually beat him to the Thunderstone for the victory.  Just.  The scores were 47 to 45!

A good solid deck builder, but not the best deck builder…

This is a nice game for about the first 10-20 plays, and that is when you realize that you will need expansions to keep it alive. 

Unfortunately, the expansions do not feel as "natural" as the base game, since the ruling and general game management gets a lot more confusing in my opinion. That's when I realized that I'd rather be playing Dominion instead.

The 'epic' variant is cool though. It keeps the game alive for another 10-15 plays or so.

RATING: 7
In this game, that borrows heavily from the mechanics of Dominion, a player's starting deck consisits of militia, food, torches and daggers. On their turn, one deals out 6 cards, and can go to the village to purchase more things (fighters, items, weapons, spells) or go to the dungeon to conquer monsters. Defeated monsters give you experience points and victory points. The experience points can be used to upgrade your fighters while in the village, and monsters can clog your hand with disease cards. An interesting mechanic is that the dungeon is three levels deep, and you need light from torches or spells, otherwise it is difficult to conquer monsters. The game ends when the thunderstone card migrates to the top level of the dungeon.

I enjoy the game, though I wish there was a way to equalize the turn order. It can't hurt to go first, so if you are going last and the game ends with the first player, you miss a turn. Other than that, I enjoy all the interesting decisions you have to make, and what cards to purchase to try and defeat monsters, who may not be there when your turn comes around!

Very fun game.  Went from interesting to must-have-it-now when I read the Epic variant.  I had been searching for the best dungeon-crawl game for years and everything else had disappointed me.  This one fills the bill quite well.  A little hard to set-up and take down but I can manage it with my own style of randomizing.  

Unfortunately, my girlfriend doesn't like it.  But I can always play solo or with my nephew.

Update:  
After the arrival of Puzzle Strike, and Legendary, there was less of a reason to keep this behemoth around.  The aforementioned games are deck-builders that play quickly and have a certain elegance in their simplicity. Thunderstone is neither quick or elegant.
 
Thunderstone is a slow, plodding beast.  It is fun at times, but tends to take too long and has turns where you have to stop and count and recount to make sure you can finally beat that monster that has essentially frozen the game. Unfortunately, these stasis-inducing moments, break up the flow, the theme and the fun quite often.

Also, it is not that fun to set-up and the Epic Variant requires a familiarity with the game to make it viable, yet by using it you discard even more strategical weight that the official game proffers.  

I tried to make it my default "dungeon run" game, but even solo, it's not that fun to me.  How can I make a fantasy game a "dungeon run" when there are no armor or shield cards because you only take into account how much gold, light, strength, physical attack and magic attack you have. Besides, the deck-building mechanic lends more to players trying to combo cards than making logical fantasy pairings.

I'm disappointed that I bought all the expansions, but I seriously thought I would have played this game for a very long time.

The concept of a thematically cohesive Dominion is brilliant. Here it is marred by appallingly poor balance and clunky design choices. Certain cards are wildly over- or under-powered, and the consequent destructive effect on gameplay is beyond the help of any simple house rules that I can devise. Add in the tedious light-penalty system, the random difficulty level of monsters in the dungeon at any particular time, and the disincentives for killing low-VP monsters and the game is something of a wreck.

Heavy similiarities to Dominion - in basic game play. But plays different enough to own and play both.

I rarely rate games I don't own, but after two very tough plays of this I'm really sure I'll never own it anyway. Sadly, it was one I really wanted to like, as I'm very interested in the genre and attempted mechanics. But for my 2 cents, it's semi broken, and also if the cards clump in your deck it will be a very frustrating experience; no matter how "even" or such the deck is "built".
Well, now three plays and it's totally toast in my book. I concure with one poster that listed your "choices" during turn; 1) Kill monster, 2) Go fish in village. Not much else to it, and the cards can group themselves into non-players even from a fairly decent assortment. Sucks, but what a great idea if it only worked!

Has the same type of deck-building mechanic as seen in Dominion. There are couple of bigger differences compared to Dominion: 
a) There is no plain money cards in game but rather some cards have money value as "extra". Also monsters (aka point-cards) are not equal but have differences and effects.
b) Your turn is not always the same but you choose either to go dungeon (gather points), go village (buy new cards) or rest (remove 1 card from hand from play).

I like both of these differences quite a bit although the choices b) offers aren't that often tough choices. My biggest complain in Dominion always have been a bit "boring" victory condition as you gather enough money (or equivalent) and then try to gain as many points as you can later to end, usually. 

There is more theme present in Thunderstone, which I like, but it also sometimes can be downside as you need more right stuff in hand to gain points. You basically need enough fighters + weapons and preferably some light-cards too in order to hack down bigger monsters deeper fron dungeon. I actually like quite a bit of the mechanic that you only have 3 monsters visible and to fight the ones "deeper in dungeon" you need more light (or suffer some minuses to damage ). That said this is also probably the biggest downside of the game especially with 4+ players. As the amount of monsters doesn't scale with number of players there is less monsters/player when played with more players. That means that if you only get 2 unlucky turns at wrong times you might miss the biggest points/monsters.

Funny that in this game too cards suffer from bad visual design (they wouldn't need to copy this from Dominion!). Here it means symbols that aren't as good as they could be. Perhaps biggest of them being too similar experience points / victory point values on monsters. Probably not as big deal once you know game better but it could be better done.

Best with 3 players but even as with 4+ it feels to have too much luck on how the monster come out and especially the last few since the +3 bonus for slaying the last one seems to be quite a bit of chunk of points.

Good game, I enjoy the deck building genre, and I feel I like this one better than dominion. It's up for trade because I am trying to consolidate my games a little bit, and I'm sure another deck builder will replace this.

I really want to like this game.  It has many of the same mechanics as Dominion, except that you "do" something with the deck you build.  Great!  Except that the dungeon mechanic just doesn't work for me, and the game is riddled with imbalanced cards, rules that seem to constantly change ("are we playing with version 1.4 of the rules?" ... sheesh!) and an arbitrary keywording system where sometimes ATTACK means "regular ATTACK" and sometimes means "total ATTACK."  Let me know when a fixed second edition comes out.

Very obviously half-Dominion and half-generic-Dungeon-Crawl, Thunderstone has its appeal in virtually infinite layouts, but there isn't really much more: Dominion has the same bite but without awkward card layouts and the requirement to buy virtually everything first before reaping VP.

Upgrade from Dominion. When playing Dominion I just feel like I'm going through the motions. It plays quicker than Thunderstone but I don't find it fun. In Thunderstone I love the fantasy theme and collecting various cards to take on monsters. I don't think its a fantastic game but would rather play anytime than dominion and its my only game that is solely a deck builder. Also the Epic variant is the only way I play.

I think this compares favorably to Dominion, while also feeling differently enough to warrant playing it in addition to Dominion.  The theming is definately better, and at times it seems like you have more options. One negative is that it is really easy for players to copy each other's strategies. However if players are willing to try to make unique decks the game is alot more fun, IMO.

The game is not actively bad.  But (to bring comparisons to Dominion), this game was not properly developed.

This could have been as good as Dominion, or even better, and the game gone through proper development time.  As it is, clumsy AEG rules, and unclear definitions make this less fun for me.

Wow! I love this game! It has basically Dominion deck building and shuffling...but more advanced card symbols and game play! You don't stop with simply making your purchases at the village! You are building a small army to go into the dungeon to kill the monsters! The need for light in the dungeon, combined with the need for heroes with enough strength to hold a good blade is absolutely essential! And it doesn't stop there...once you kill a monster, it continues to surface in your hand of cards and provides you with hindrances or benefits towards your next battles...awesome...challenging...too good! Until the rulebook is reprinted, definitely check out the AEG website for the updated rules, there are some definite clarifications and adjustments that you will need!

Simply outstanding game...will definitely be looking for expansions when they come!

Thunderstone is like Dominion but not as good. Primarily because it is longer, more random and has less interaction. The game is more complex and would take longer to learn

I didn't like the random deck of monsters, but I suppose with experience you'd learn what is in each deck. The reason I say it is more random is that there are more conditions that must be met to have a good hand. You need light, people, items, enough strength to use items, enough attack power, and the attack must be of the right type to hurt the monster (magic/non magic/either). If any one of those things fails, you won't be able to kill the monster (though you can work it out before deciding whether to attack or not). But if you keep on drawing hands that put you 1-2 attack power short, you'll lose, like I did.

First game and I was impressed, even with the hype machine running prior to playing.  Not as smooth or elegant as dominion, but a very strong and enjoyable theme.  With more plays, this rating is almost certain to be higher.  Staying tentative until a few more village/hero/dungeon combos are tried.

edit: The 7.5 works for this.  With a bunch of combinations, this game was still very fun.  However the mechanics are pretty rough, the village cards are not very balanced, and the dungeon seems to stall out when filled with weak minions that just clutter your deck.

edit: This game has really faded for me.  Dominion is just so much better.  There are too many flaws in this game, it feels rushed.  It really makes me sad because I want to like this game, but Mike Elliott's last effort in Hecatomb was so much superior.  It is still "good", but not what it could be.

Always enjoy Thunderstone but never *love* it.

I never feel like I earned my victories, and never feel like I deserved my losses. Great color and setting material, though.

RATING: 8
An interesting Dominion clone with better story and substance, but with the downside potential of bogging down rather than accelerating to an end. Instead of aiming to buy more money and then buy VPs, here you buy weapon and hero cards which have both money and attack points. Depending on what hand you draw on your turn (ie lots of money or lots of attack), you buy better things and add 'em to your deck or you use your attack points to claim a monster card for VPs (also adding it to your now more clogged up deck). The amount of light points on your cards will dictate how far along the monster draft you can attack, and your heroes also may need strength points to be able to include weapon cards in your attack, so there's more things to check, manipulate and manage. As always, deck stripper powers are powerful. The potential bogginess depends on how the monsters come out vs how people have built their decks, with the potential of there being some near unbeatables and people therefore just doing buys rather than progressing the monster kill (which drives the end-game). Once you throw in expansion sets, obviously the game has a ton of variety and replayability. Your preference for this may come down to your tolerance of variable game length and perhaps a more uneven progression through the game - or call it improved storyline if you will.

Jason Engle's Artwork really helps the feel of this. Original Thunderstone is Diablo; Thunderstone Advance is The Elder Scrolls.

This game is good basic, with expansions, and solo. Learn one of the standalone games first before you jump into the expansions with it. Then adding the expansions will be more fun and meaningful to you.

I used to love this game.  Great Fun! My wife liked this so much, she played more of it in her dreams after the evening we learned it. We then borrowed the game from a good friend, and promptly played it more times than any 2 games we own combined that year.

Unfortunately, it plays too long for what it does. As of this writing, I'd rather play Ascension, Pathfinder ACG, or Legendary.

RATING: 4
It really did feel like "Dilbert goes to the dungeon". We had a poor choice of cards, and should have gone with a stock deck. But even so, having no control over whether you get heroes, weapons, useless monster corpses, or whatever was really frustrating. 

There was nothing about the "deckbuilding" process that really pulled me in. Not a surprise, as I came in with low expectations (but an open mind). Dominion is better, partly because it doesn't attempt (and fail at) having a strong theme.

UPDATE: Increasing rating to 5 after playing a bad game of Dominion. I'm now trusting that a good game of Thunderstone would be as much better than the one I played as a good game of Dominion is over that bad one.

UPDATE: Lowered rating back to 4 after playing Thunderstone Advance (which also got a 4). I am convinced that Thunderstone in any flaver just is not a game for me.

Played only solo (so far). It`s quite difficult and entertaining variant of the game. It remainds me RftG with robot.

Edit: 
As a multiplayer game - rating 3. 
The whole game experience realyy depends on card You draw from Your deck. Choises are extremaly obvious. Lack of interraction makes this games tedious and uninteresting.

As a solitaire game - rating 7.
Nice, quick and simple. Monsters really raid the village (in multiplayer they are just sitting in their dungeon and waiting for death, bleeeee)

Edit 2
To be honest, I have to raise my rating a bit. Multiplayer game can be bit better if You get players who really know what are they doing and tend to play in rather agressive way. In 2 person game it think it`s good have only two races of monsters in the deck instead of three. 

Bu I still like solitaire version more than multiplayer

Edit: I played a lot and with every new game I found Thunderstone more and more repetitive and boring.

Based on one play: yes, it is similar to Dominion, in mechanics but the theme is quite different. You need to collect cards to buy better items and fighters, but the main gaol is to use the fighters to kill off enemies in the dungeon (basically instead of using money to get points, as in Dominion, you use money to get items & fighters only and then fighting ability to get points). Nice for those who like theme and fairly fun to play, but seems like more of the same. Dominion did it right already, so no need for another clone.

The game starts out somewhat like Dominion, but quickly you realize that building you deck to amass large amounts of gold won't work so well.  While the higher-cost town items are pretty good, they'll disappear quickly leaving you with a large pile of gold and nothing good to spend it on.  What you really want to do is buy stuff that will specifically help you fight the monster classes that are available, and thus gain VPs and experience.  The problems with this are twofold.  First, unless you're very familiar with all the monster classes and town items, it's not clear what you should be buying, and you might be stuck with a bunch of useless stuff later.  Second, certain combinations of town cards and monster classes won't work so well, as none of the town cards might be effective against some monsters.  Which is, you know, very frustrating.

Good game with beautiful art but compared to Dominion the gameplay is not as exciting. There are not that much possibilities for creative card combos (the thing I love about Dominion). The combinations all seem quite straightforward and simple (or maybe I just fail to see the more interesting combos?) It felt more about adding together money or strenght on cards and deciding wheter to go and buy something or attack a monster. So while the deck building is fun and monster hunting theme is great the game does not provide as intersting decision making as I would like. Player interaction seems to be quite low also - I did not see much possibilities to manipulate other players hand or deck.

It's Dominion in a dungeon... it's Dunginion! 

Thunderstone uses Dominion's trademark deck building mechanic in a dungeon theme. 

Players are trying to assemble a party, equip it, and then explore a monster infested dungeon in search of a legendary Thunderstone. On their turn they can rest (trash one card), go to the village to buy items, learn spells or recruit heroes, or take their chances at the monster infested dungeon. Killing monster provides points, experience to the heroes and bonus effects. Experience can be used to upgrade de heroes into more powerful versions.

It's a little more layered than Dominion. It doesn't seem to suffer from those annoying 10 minute turns, where someone plays 20 cards but it also is significantly longer.


The theme works really well and I'm not even all that into D&D or Magic: the gathering. 

Really enjoying this right now.

Original Thunderstone series improved upon by Thunderstone Advance. As a whole the game is a great deckbuilder. Even the original series.

This sounds like an interesting variant of Dominion. And the theme actually means something in this game.

2nd solo game. Interesting. But some heroes are useless in solo unfortunately.

I like this so far. The theme works well for the game: each turn you decide to go to the village, the dungeon, or to rest, each offering different opportunities; you get to level up your characters; monsters are flavorful and distinct.

Some cons: there is a fair amount of modifier crunching, which may turn off some. The game is a bit longer than its cousin, Dominion. It feels a bit strange not to have persistent characters - one day your dwarf has his trusty flaming sword, the next he's just munching on iron rations. And, of course, the game is crying out for expansions.

Really enjoyed playing Thunderstone. Mechanics are similar to Dominion, but this card game comes with a dungeon crawler theme that is more tightly integrated. As a frequent Dominion player, I found it easy to adjust to the game-- the main difference is instead of buying victory points, you're earning them by fighting monsters. 

Not entirely sure I would purchase this since I already own Dominion. However, I definitely wouldn't turn down a play of it either.

2/18/11 We played this a lot over the last year.  We liked it a lot at first, but the pacing does not hold up well over time.  Too many games stall out when facing monsters that require the opposite condition from the last monster.  We tried a lot of variants, and there is probably an ideal fix out there.  But we have a lot of games:  better deckbuilding games and better fantasy games... time to break up with this one, it's just a bad fit for us.

3/17/10[-]After just one play, I have a tingly feeling of giddiness.  I think this is going to be an awesome game!  I love the Dominion-esque in-game deck-building, and I love the tremendous replay potential of all the different cards.  The instructions (even the updated v.1.4 ones) are exasperatingly full of "wait, what are they talking about?" cross-referencing moments, but once muddled through, the game is not difficult to learn.[/-]

All plays for Thunderstone filed under the base game entry.

Main problem with Thunderstone is that the game really starts to drag when your deck clogs up with monsters. 

Also, the new prepare action only helps to a certain extent as you still have to pass quite a few turns before being able to finally draw a good hand. However, I would always play with the new action and never play without it again.

What I like about Thunderstone are the hand management aspects, long-term planning on which cards to get in your deck versus which cards to trash.. In short, all the elements of a good deckbuilder. 

It also has the added element of the dungeon and certain timing issues which Dominion does not have.

Good deck building game, with a very different feeling from Dominion. My wife loves it because of the dungeon/monster killing theme and I do too. I also find out that the pace of this game is different, and the overall time to finish a session is usually longer in average than a Dominion session. I have been able to finish some Dominion sessions in less than fifteen minutes by using a killer strategy, where in Thunderstone you go until you reach the stone, and that means you must kill about the same amount of monsters each session.

A more relaxed Dominion. Nowhere near as elegant, tense, or challenging, but quite possibly just more fun. Building a band of adventurers and equipment, killing monsters and leveling up is great, especially within the deckbuilding genre with its timing choices.

Dominion is the more challenging and better developed game, though. In Dominion, you have to judge the value of cards to buy within the set of available cards and always keeping in mind what the others are buying. What cards are available, and which aren't, has a huge effect on strategy. In Thunderstone there are simply bad cards, that you never want to buy regardless of the set of available cards. So in any given set (of 16) there are only four or so that you might want, regardless of what 'strategy' you're going for. The question becomes then if it's better to buy a good card or get rid of a bad one, and whether you want to defeat the little monster, or wait for the big one (and to judge this, you need to know what's in the monster deck, and get a little lucky, too).

Fun, but thin on strategy and replayability.

I love the game play here. A great title. 

I'm highly annoyed by the layout, however. Every card has a "Village" function and a "Dungeon" function. Some do something when you fight the card (called a "Battle" function). The icons that tell you what a card does are scattered all around, however. It would have been easy to put one set on one side, and another on the other, with a few battle icons on the bottom, top, or center.

Also, a picture of a gear means, "Use this in the dungeon," and "DUNGEON" means, "Use this in the dungeon." And also no symbol at all means, "Use this in the dungeon," if it's attack power. 

There's a light system where for every light you're missing, you get -2 Attack. This multiplication could have been removed by simply doubling all the light numbers in the game. 

None of this matters once you get the swing of it, but it really could have been easier to learn and teach.

If I ever inherit a fortune from a long-lost childless uncle, I plan to buy the rights to this awesome game and retool its terrible layout choices.

Dominion + D&D = fun.  The card artwork is really fantastic, and there's less player conflict than Dominion.  However, the game can stall when tough monsters accumulate early, and the strategy is a bit less interesting than Dominion.  Let's see where the upcoming expansions take the game before we pass judgement.

A root canal would be faster than this. The random set up sucks, strong monsters come out at the beginning, some character classes aren't available including lots of items. The game is too random, felt like shuffling cards for an hour before we could kill anything. One player after 2 hours of really trying got 2 VPs! Just because he couldn't draw the right 6 cards together. CRAP, but hey it's got awesome art and a lovely theme.

It's just like Dominion, but worth playing!

Thank god they came up with a good game that could utilize that deck building mechanic.  And this is a really clever implementation.  I love how the monsters are worth the victory points and you basically have to choose whether to go for the VP or more cards.

The decisions are still usually pretty obvious, but at least it feels like you're doing something.  Even the theme feels pretty strong to me, especially with leveling up your heroes.

I like this game, but the rules in the box are quite ambiguous; fortunately the rules upgrade solved most doubts. I think some cards are not so balanced, but in a game like this one every player may make use of them, so the game rebalances itself alone quite well. I use six little wooded-black tokens to mark the darkness differencies between the dungeon ranks; I stand up the dungeon cards and I put the tokens in front of them (respectively one, two and three). I find it an intuitive solution.
A suggestion: play with the Thunderstone value setted to 0 because as it is (3 pts) it's a non-sense in my opinion.
Very good artwork.

RATING: N/A
One of the silliest modern games I've played, and a game that makes me highly suspect of what boardgame "design" even is. Because this game is more or less Dominion (i.e., designed by someone else) that a second person (inexplicably referred to as a "designer" as well) has added flavor text to. 

In an attempt to take a mechanism and add theme, the coherence has been removed. And I refuse to accept a game as being thematic simply because it has geek-approved nouns, verbs, and artwork. What on earth is thematic about drawing a pile of weapons into your hand but no one to use them? What is thematic about buying weapons for people, only to have those weapons not show up in your hand? What is thematic about saving up your light (one of about 4 functionally identical game currencies you'll be collecting during the game) so that you can venture farther into the dungeon to encounter the monster whose card art clearly shows them to be outdoors? 

I don't care for deckbuilding as it feels like pre-game to me, and I also don't care for how most deckbuilding games reward players for thinning their deck (as in, "The opposite of building a deck"). So yes, I was probably not going to like this. But it doesn't improve on Dominion, does not engage the imagination, and certainly does not join theme and mechanisms in any meaningful way.

Hard to avoid comparing with Dominion, even though the comparison is not quite fair (I've played Dominion some 200-300 times more than this). In principle a nice game, but too simple rounds, lack of drama arch because the monsters don't get harder during the game, and a bit too fiddly. Things like rounds with 40 strength for beating opponents of strength 6 are quite boring.

[b]Quick Comment:[/b]
Thunderstone is a card drafting game in the same vein as Dominion.  Whereas Dominion is a soulless abstract exercise in efficiency, Thunderstone actually has a theme and more complex and interesting card interactions.  It also has a graphic design that puts Dominion to shame.  However it still manages to make a few of Dominion's mistakes, namely the lack of player interaction and the feel that the game is playing you.  Its graphic design could have been better.

[b]Review:[/b]
The Thunderstone set up is longer than Dominion's.  You need to choose three random sets of monsters, four random sets of Heroes and eight random sets of Village cards.  The three sets of monsters are shuffled into a Dungeon deck and the Thunderstone card is shuffled in near the bottom to act as a game ending device.  The top three Dungeon cards are turned face up.  The other cards, along with a few standard start cards go in the Village.  Players get a starting deck of food, militia, daggers and torches from which they draw a hand of six cards.

Cards have various kinds of stats on them: Cost, Gold, Weight, Attack, Light, Strength, etc. as well as unique special powers.  On a turn a player can use the Gold values on their cards to buy cards from the village which go into their deck.  Or they can use the Attack, Strength and Light cards to fight one of the face up Dungeon cards which will be replaced by a card from the top of the deck.  The Dungeon cards are monsters of various types.  When defeated they provide experience points and victory points among other rewards.  A defeated monster also goes in a player's deck.

Some of the fun things about Thunderstone:
1.  There are eight sets of Monsters.  The sets include everything from dragons to demons.  Not only is there variation within a set, i.e. not all dragons are the same, there tends to be a "boss" monster that is stronger than the rest.  However the monsters come out in a random order so you might turn all the bosses face up at the beginning.

2.  The Hero cards can level up and, in so doing, gain power.  But you need to defeat monsters in order to get the XP for leveling up.  Heroes are also needed to use weapons.

3.  The Village may not provide the ideal tools for defeating Dungeon monsters.  Sometimes the Dungeon is a cake walk and sometimes its brutal.  Some may view this as a flaw.  I think it adds to the adventure and exploration elements of the game.

Some not so great stuff:
1.  Like Dominion the primary mode of player interaction concerns who can grab up the cool cards first.  Jim Pinto, the game's developer, has stated that they are trying to come up with player vs. player rules.  I think it would be cool if they were to do so by adding Dungeon cards that require players to attack each other.  Thematically it could represented by monsters that force players to fight each other or something as simple as a treasure horde that two (or more) players stumble upon at the same time.

2.  The cards play you.  Players can't directly control what cards are in their hands.  You can buy stuff and put it in your deck.  But then you have to hope that the right stuff comes out at the right time.  In the CCGs I've played, if you only get half of a combo in your hand you typically will have some way to hold on to that card and fish the rest of the combo from you deck.  But in Thunderstone you have to discard your entire hand every turn.  Why?  Sure, there are some cards that you have to play even if you don't want to.  But I'd like to try a variant where players reveal their hand, play the cards they want and have to and take the rest of their cards back into their hand and refill up to six.

3.  The art is beautiful.  The card lay out could have been better.  Having the card type icons in the upper left corner rather than half way down the card would have made separating out the cards much easier.  And why are the attack values listed in the card text rather than included with all the other basic stats along the left side of the card?  It makes tracking your current attack strength a pain.

These negative issues a side, the game allows players to construct their own dungeon delving decks.  Trying to construct the perfect monster killing deck is a blast.  It's great fun trying to race your opponents for the good cards and the big kills.  The game mechanisms actually seem to be saying something rather than being a pure abstract number game.  Thunderstone is not just a great entry into the deck building genre but into the dungeon crawl genre as well.

Wow. What I have to evaluate now is whether this game will now have ruined Dominion for me. I mean, it's got the deckbuilding aspect which I love, but this one actually has theme.

The upside:
-A deck-building game with a purpose that makes some sense. Recruiting heroes and inventory items to use them against monsters for VPs it's alright.
-Possibility of leveling your cards/heroes with the XP gained.

The downside:
-Lack of an intelligent storage solution for sleeved cards.
-Almost sure it drags a little longer than it should.

We ended up selling this and I think it is just not that great of a game in the end. The way the disease cards work seems broken to me and the game can easily slow to a real drudge. The "Advance" version supposedly improves on this but I don't feel any desire to find out.

Acquired a copy recently and Kristen and I have been playing it fairly extensively. It's really quite fun, but I think it scratches an entirely different itch than Dominion. While Thunderstone has a sort of roundabout engine building it is more about making a thin, efficient deck with which to slay monsters where Dominion can be about getting off large but efficient combinations of cards. They are both fun and I will continue to play both. I do feel however that the box and general storage is terrible and the game practically screams for expansions.

The expansions fix this game for me, I adore it now. It's still cumbersome and time consuming with a lot of people though.

Some call it a Dominion clone... so what?  It definitely is a beast of its own and does not have the same feel when playing at all.  I've bought all Dominion expansions up to Prosperity and the last time I played Dominion, I MISSED Thunderstone.  It was a shocking revelation to me, and actually led to cancelling my Prosperity pre-order.  Thunderstone is, in short, awesome if you give it a chance.  I'm all for making conflict a bit less certain, so I'm looking forward to more difficult monsters and traps in the expansions.   Note for AEG:  Please don't read 'difficult' as monsters that will clog up the call and drag the game out longer than needed... read it as 'an element of surprise' or some type of variability to the mobs instead of me knowing the monster I find the in the dark will have weakness X and Y hitpoints every single time... let's change it up people.

A good game, similar in its basics to Dominion. I'd say that Dominion is a cleaner, simpler design, easier to learn and remember, with less fiddly arithmetic. (You may or may not think these are advantages.) Unlike Dominion, Thunderstone has a real theme, and you (mostly) can't just buy victory points, but must win them by defeating monsters. (Same caveat.)

I wasn't originally sure whether it's really necessary to own both games, and felt that Dominion might flourish in our household while Thunderstone would languish. This turned out not to be true at all. After more than a dozen plays of Thunderstone (plus some solitaire games which I don't log) we're still enjoying Thunderstone very much. And yes, we still enjoy and play Dominion too! They feel different in spite of their many similarities.

I've only played this solo at this point. It's a cool game. I really like the feel of building up a party to take down monsters. The theme is much more prevalent than Dominion, though I can see this getting less play time due to some of the groups I play with (most don't care for a fantasy theme, and find such themes off-putting).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Thunderstone borrows heavily from Dominion, a game I really like, but adds a few twists and turns.

Things I enjoy about Thunderstone:
- I love the theme - its a lot of fun to give your Thyrian Squire a flaming sword and have him kill the Gray Ooze.  To me, this is more satisfying than buying a Duchy.
- The artwork on the cards is top notch and fun to look at.
- The game lasts about 30 to 45 minutes - about the perfect length for me.

Things I do not enjoy about Thunderstone:
- The box insert is the worst insert I have ever seen.
- The light mechanic - while a good idea -is slightly clunky in its implementation.  I could see new players getting frustrated with light penalty questions (or the ability of charaters to carry certain weapons as well).
- The Iconography lacks distinction.  Many of the Icons are slightly similar in appearance.  After a few games I don't have many issues anymore, but a more discernable way of laying out the modifiers (perhaps more colorful?) would be a help to teaching the game.
- The theme sits less well with my wife - if you or your gaming partners are not into fantasy, you might want to stay with Dominion.
- The rules can be very unintuitive, and the rulebook has already been updated on AEG's website.  I am surprised by some of the rulings on the forums in regard to the way certain cards work (specifically pawnbroker).
  
End result - I really enjoy Thunderstone and I am glad I added it to my collection, even with its similarities to Dominion. 

Update : AEG has done its best to address the rule questions w/ rules version 1.4.  I think it works well now, though I think the cards could be better balanced.

Update 3/23/10 : After playing Thunderstone a few more times, I am lowering its rating to a 6.75.  Honestly, I am frustrated with cards like the Selurin that are difficult to understand and seem way overpowered.  There is so much potential in this game, but I am not having as much fun playing it as I think I should have.

My first step into deck building games and a real mixed bag for me. The mechanics are simple and easy to grasp and the solo mode is solid.

Where it lost me is the theme and presentation. The art is fantastic, brilliant even but it is so devoid of character that I could never get immersed in the game. You have this fantastic bit of art, with a generic title and zero flavour text.

It was years later when I played Shadowrun: Crossfire that I realized that was the main issue I had with Thunderstone. In crossfire you have brilliant art, lots of character and interesting text and quotes on the cards so whilst I am not big into deck builders I still enjoy that game more.

For me Thunderstone is a solid game with none of the charm that makes me want to play a game!

A great deck building game. I prefer this so much more than Dominion. I have played solo, two and three player. Each time I add a person my rating goes up. A three player game was as good as it gets for me.

The fact that you can go to town to buy or to the Dungeon Hall to kill a monster make the game more flavored and diverse. You cant just get a lot of card combos like in Dominion. You need to do what is best with your hand. Killing monsters is the way to get Victory Points, but you can't do this until you get the right mix in your deck, which you get from going to the town.

Note: Rating has gone up after a few more plays.

Works well solo. Works well with 2.  Very small amount of downtime with 2. Deck building dungeon crawler.  I enjoy this one a lot more than Dominion because it is a heavier game in my opinion as there is a lot more to manage turn by turn.  Dominion is filler, this is not.

Dungeons and Dominion is what this game should've been called. :)

Plays almost exactly like Dominion with a decent amount of tweaks to help the theme feel right at home and right at home it sure does feel. I love the theme and the mechanics of this. Decisions weigh much heavier on you than in Dominion. I find myself thinking heavily for the most optimal play with each hand, whereas Dominion the most optimal play is usually the most obvious. :)

However, I enjoy Dominion more because the card interactions are much more interesting, the game is much simpler, and the games are much shorter.

--Mar2010-- Interesting themed take on the Dominion-pioneered constructed deck theme.  I'm roughly as amused by this title as by Dominion, at first examination:  content to play occasionally, but not really seeking out the game.

RATING: 7
I immediately found the theme and art to be vast improvements over Dominion.  I think the goal of the game is also more engaging.  In Deck building games you have to try to manage how many useless cards are in your deck.  Thunderstone is less complicated than Dominion in that respect and that is something I hope to see AEG fix in expansions...   With such theme, this could fall prey to expansions over complicating game play by adding thematic abilities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The more that I play Thunderstone and some of the expansions, the more I realize how easy it is to get stuck with high level monsters, but not enough attack strength to take them down. Also, the set-up and take-down time is huge. I have recently switched to Ascension because of these problems. Maybe they will fix these things in Thunderstone Advance.

Very solid deckbuilder. Still low on the player interaction, but the theme is fantastic and my family very much enjoys the race for conquering those monsters.

Great deck building game, once one has a basic understanding of the game and manual, it's easy enough to see what all the fuss is about and why this game is becoming bigger and better. I only own the original base game so far but look forward to more of this wonderful game, also the art in this game is excellent by Jason Engle.

It's not an easy game to master, but give the game a go by buying at least the base game if anybody is on the fence, and then make up your own mind.

I don't like how it implements the theme. I mean, you pay gold to hire these heroes and they don't show up! You get a Militia man with three torches, and a sword he can't even lift. This is a fantasy game if Dilbert's pointy-haired boss invented it.

"Okay, we're ready to enter the dungeon of arbitrary project goals. We should be able to defeat a project because we hired some heroic engineers, and bought upgraded servers. How many heroic engineers do we have?"

"None."

"But we just hired Alice last turn."

"She's not here."

"She's not here?"

"Nope."

"Where is she?"

"Somewhere in the deck."

"How about that new server?"

"Oh, yeah. We got that. Requires a strength 4 to operate it."

"Do we have anyone with strength 4?"

"We have three Wallys and an Asok. So... no."

"Jeez! Do we have anything else besides Wallys and an Asok in our hand?"

"We have Doughnuts with Gooseberry filling."

"Will they help?"

"No, but they're tasty and worth 2 Victory Points."

****

"Ye gods! The dungeon is full of undead! Hire a Cleric immediately!"
"Yes, sir!"

THE NEXT MORNING
"Well, off we go!"
"We can't, sir."
"What happened to that cleric we hired?"
"He isn't here."
"Didn't we pay him his tithe?"
"Yes, and he says in a note, 'Thank you very much.'"
"Can we afford another Cleric?"
"No, but we can buy some lovely gooseberries, sir."
"That won't do. Who do we have?"
"Three militia men."
"Good!"
"And a sword."
"Even better!"
"Except none of the militia men are strong enough to carry the sword."
"Didn't we pack some iron rations?"
"Well, that was for the last expedition."
"The one in which all we had was a thief and three torches."
"Yes, sir."
"Well, can we do anything?"
"We can use the sword to get more gooseberries, sir?"

The mechanics of the game are so similar to those of Dominion that it has to be judged in comparison, and in comparison it does not deliver. Simply put, it feels less streamlined, and takes significantly longer to play for a fundamentally similar experience. Despite adding in a combat system, I don't feel that Thunderstone offers enough of anything, apart from its theme, that Dominion does not already.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of the best deck-builders out there. It offers a lot of advantages over it's counterparts. First and foremost is the feeling of substance, like you're playing a full game of something instead of some 20-minute affair. Also nice is the short turns. No more endless comboing of villages for 4 coins. Just throw them all out, and do something. But my favorite thing is that this is definitely a fantasy game more than a deck-builder. You do have room for strategy and customization, but more than anything you are fighting monsters.

It's a little lumpy in places. A bad mix of cards will slow the game down a lot, and if the monsters are too tough that'll also bog things down. But you can at least fine-tune the mix of cards, and a slow start will usually mean there will be a speedy denouement. I really like Thunderstone a lot, and it's even better with more expansions.

Comment based solely off of solitaire plays. A good deck building game in the same vein as Dominion. Where it differs is in the dungeon and village sections (fight monsters in the dungeon and buy equipment in the village). I also like the ability to level up your heroes. Over all it is an enjoyable gaming experience with a typical game taking 30-45 minutes. If I want a dungeon crawl style game that doesn't take hours to play then this fits the bill.

RATING: 9
This game draws inspiration heavily from Dominion, but adds a dungeon crawl to the mix.  Players have a common pool of a cards (Village cards) to purchase, building a deck.  They draw a hand of 6 cards each turn, and decide to go to the Village to buy more cards, or go into the Dungeon to face one of three monsters.  The goal of the game is to find the Thunderstone buried in the dungeon; this triggers the end of the game.

Players gain XP to level up heroes, and victory points for killing monsters.  In the end the player with the most victory points in his deck wins the game.  This drives the deck building to be one part economic (to recruit heroes and buy equipment) and one part practical (to kill monsters).  Having a focus on killing monsters really gives the game a purpose that Dominion does not.

Bardzo fajna gra deckbuildingowa w klimatach fantasy. Zaopatrujemy się w wiosce i robimy wypady do lochu na potwory, które dają nam pkt zwycięstwa. Trochę niestety zapychają potem rękę, ale jakoś da się z tym żyć. Minusem jest to, że spośród różnych postaci biorących udział w rozgrywce przeważnie znajdzie się jedna, dwie lepsze od innych i głównie one będą wykorzystywane. Grupy potworów też niestety dość nierówne, niektóre potrafią stanowić spore wyzwanie inne pokonuje się praktycznie z marszu, bez specjalnego przygotowania.

This is the best deckbuilding game that I've tried. It takes [i]Dominion[/i] and adds it a truthful theme.  Now players don't just buy the points, they have to fight for them with a lot of card combinations at the dungeon.  Players have now a real puzzle to solve in almost every battle.  The games shines with three players at most. With more than that, the downtime would be unacceptable.  The solo play works very fine and is very challenging, being a good alternative way to play.

I am surprised at how much I like this game.  I enjoy the fantasy genre and so that part clicks with me.  I like the different heroes, exploring different card combos, the different kinds of monsters, and everything.  My two boys (ages 11 and 9) really enjoy the game as well, which is an added bonus since it is a game we all enjoy and can play together (unlike some kids' games).  Have the For the Dwarf promo from BGG.  

The randomizers do not work well.  Creation of village card sets needs to be thoughtful and with consideration of the monsters' particular weaknesses and strengths.  Otherwise, the game can bog down greatly.  For example, if you have golems out but have weak heroes and no way to improve their strength other than iron rations, you are not going to be able to kill the golems.  It gets boring fast when that happens.  Thoughtful consideration is necessary for pacing in this game.

Dominion-like?  Yes.  Dominion clone?  No, definitely tweaked - and the addition of heroes and'battling' the monsters makes it a step up.  

The game plays fast and with the random choices of heroes villages and monsters, absolutely replayable.  The fact that it supports from 1-5 players is a definite plus, as is the improved rule set that has been developed.

A superb, in-depth variant of Dominion.  A better game in my opinion if you want your decisions to carry more weight.  Definitely not as quick as Dominion but Thunderstone's theme is light years ahead in comparison.

Card quality is good.  Art quality is generally excellent.  The graphical layout is a bit crap.  Why important information on cards like XP and VP so similarly coloured is mystifying.  Why are XP cards not significantly different?  Why are upgraded hero cards not differentiated more?

Looking forward to expansion(s).

RATING: 3
This is a game that takes the ideas of Dominion, and tries to improve on them unsuccessfully. It doesn't solve any of the problems with Dominion, and adds several problems of it's own. The game drags on much longer than Dominion, and you need combinations of cards in order to accomplish anything. The two currencies are badly implemented here, as you can only use one of those currencies in a turn, and you often need a fair amount of a currency to do anything useful. This, combined with the lack of hand management, makes the game far more luck based than Dominion. Many of the monsters have abilities that make them extremely annoying to deal with, and overall the game delivers an unsatisfying experience. 

The variant epic Thunderstone has potential, but I don't want to spend time fine tuning the card distributions and rules when I could be playing better deckbuilding games anyway. 

The addition of hand management in the more recent sets could help marginally, but not enough to fix the game for me.

Después de probar el Dominion, que me pareció demasiado abstracto, me vi atraído por este Thunderstone.

Después de investigar sus defectos, jugué directamente la versión de Tom Vasel, juntando todas las cartas y creo que el resultado es un buen juego.

Bastante temático y entretenido, entre sus defectos está una duración excesiva.

En cualquier caso, el juego como tal está francamente mal desarrollado si se han tenido que utilizar esas home rules. Así mismo, no escala bien, siendo su mejor número de jugadores 3. A 4 se puede jugar, pero la duración se dispara y a 2, se ensucia demasiado el mazo con monstruos.

I much prefer Dominion, but a lot of the people I play with prefer Thuderstone to Dominion due to the theme. Thunderstone definitely hits on its theme, which likely makes this more enjoyable for some. I personally think the theme makes the mechanics a little clunky at times and the decks a little less focused, but I'm usually happy to play Thunderstone when it comes out.

RATING: 5
I have to say, this game was something of a surprise to me.  Strangely, I had not even heard of the game prior to learning the game.  It became apparent quite quickly, though that this shared the same (ahem) domain of Dominion.  That in itself is a challenging distinction given how well regarded Dominion is.  And make no mistake, I like Dominion...a lot.

Still, as I listened to the rules, I had very high hopes for Thunderstone.  I came into gaming via Dungeons and Dragons when I was much younger.  I still enjoy well down Dungeon Crawls.  This game seemed like it had a lot of potential -- creating and equipping parties, fighting monsters for experience, advancing characters.  Neat Stuff!!!

Unfortunately, the play left me less than impressed.  Problem one seems to be that the deck-building mechanism really does not hold up to 1-1/2 hour games.  Even games of Dominion that last this long are tedious.  Problem two is the dreaded 7 gold problem from Dominion.  There were many turns where I was 1 coin or one strength shy of being able to do something remotely useful.  Granted, the deck trimming mechanism is more useful than we initially applied it, but I don't believe that it is useful enough to overcome this problem.  There is also the question of the really poor iconography in the game.  It would have taken essentially zero effort to enhance this, and despite the designer's protests otherwise, I don't beleive it would have detracted significantly from the artwork.  

For me, though, the biggest problem is that several times while playing I had the thought, "I would rather be playing Dominion" or "I should have been playing Dominion".  It's never good for your game to make the player wish they were playing something else (better).

All that said, there is plenty going on here that I can see being enough for people to like.  The leveling system is interesting, and I really like the idea of light in the game.  Still, despite statements elsewhere, there is only a single path to victory -- buying victory points, uh, killing monsters.  I hope that future plays allow me to elevate my current rating.

Superb dungeon-themed deck building adventure game with all the elements that make Dominion a blast to play over and over again with the added aspects of within game hero leveling and monster combat! Any fan of AD&D will appreciate the art and attention paid to detail for the characters, monsters, weapons, magic and treasures. Though the rules are necessarily a little more cumbersome than a match of the more fast-paced Dominion,it doesn't take too much time investment to master light modifiers and the guardian breach. The Thundermaster randomizer tool at http://asmor.com/scripts/tsrand/ is a great way to quickly select balanced village and dungeon cards.

Somehow I end up liking and playing this more and more. Firstly I was - ok, better than other deck builders. Then my girlfriend and friends jumped at it and we just played it a lot. 

Why is it good: best MPS I've played so far (sorry RFTG) though it's hard to pinpoint why. I think developers did a great job with theme to gameplay connection and breaking down unintuitive connection of dominion cards into smaller, graspable parts: weapon connects to a hero, bow to archer, some cards are worth money, other less so or not at all and so on. What comes out of it, is a game, that's fairly easy to grasp and just play. Also great for people who can't handle direct conflict, but like theme. 


Why it's bad: in order to get replayibily of RFTG you'll have to invest in at least one base set and 2 expansions.
 
On Advance: Not sure. I don't like the new visual style at all, weapons look downright terrible.

It is more complicated, less clear, less focused and more influenced by the luck of the draw than Dominion. Still, after my first game of Thunderstone if I was offered to play Dominion or Thunderstone, I would go for Thunderstone.
Just feels much better to go exploring the dungeon and killing the monsters therein.
2013-06 decreased the rating 8->7.5, it just doesn't have such an appeal for me compared to other new games

Really good game, on par with Dominion, though more confusing for new players. The only drawback is a long setup time and the 3 points for the Thunderstone itself, which should really be only 1 point.

If players are equally good and play similar strategies, it comes down to the luck of the draw.

RATING: 3
Not intuitive at all. The theme is extremely thin. While I can tolerate that in Dominion (after all, politics and all that can be rather abstract), this is not ok here. The fights are just accounting exercises and there is no random element at all, meaning you know beforehand whether you will win a fight or not. Mechanic-wise that is solid, while not thrilling, but for the theme I find it deadly.

This game to Dominion is like Defenders of the Realm to Pandemic - it's filled with fantasy fluff, long and sometimes overcomplicated. 

I'm pretty sure it will be better if I'll play this game 20 times, but I don't think it worth this time investment.

There are a few things I don't like about this game.  The "combat system" is screwy, stupid and doesn't make sense -- typically Eurogame nonsense.  *** Basically, in some ways, it just starts to feel like Advanced Munchkin.

I think I'll stick with Dominion until Eurogame designers figure out a decent combat system.

Dominion fantasy környezetben, de annál jóval érdekesebb. A Dominionról azt írtam unalmas pasziánsz. Itt azért a szörnyekkel való harc és sok egymásra is hatással levő kártya sokkal több színt visz bele. Itt nem igaz az, hogy egy adott kiosztásra pár perc játék után lehet számolni a nyerő stratégiát és ez szerintem nagyon fontos. A téma pedig jóval izgalmasabb számomra, mint Dominion esetében. A játékmenet teljesen hasonló, paklit építenek a játékosok és szörnyekkel harcolnak. Nagyon változatos, nagyon magas újrajátszhatóság. Én úgy érzem a szerencse azért elég meghatározó sok helyen, de élvezetes volt vele a játék.

Own the base game and some of the early expansions. This was a fun one for a long time, but then they stopped the run and released the Advance system (which effectively stopped us from playing the game). Every once in a while we dip back into these early cards for some silly dungeoneering fun.

This reminds me of when El Grande came out and everyone was excited to create games that used Kramer's ideas.  Some of them were good rip-offs, others were really lame rip-offs.  

This is a pretty good rip-off of Dominion.  It's not trying to fool anyone, which is nice.  It took Dominion's ideas and what worked best in Munchkin and made a game for people that wanted more from both.  

Because Monsters are worth VPs, Xps, AND Money (plus some occasional super power), I can't help but feel that the decision tree is to defeat the best monster that you can, then if not feel free to buy something. I hope that there is something more to the game.

Simplistic and clunky, but you know you get to kill some stuff and level up.

My new favorite deck builder! The theme is more appealing to me than Dominion.  And it has a bit more depth in the form of a light system and a carrying capacity for your heroes.

RATING: 8
Somewhat flawed, but still a joy to play. This is kind of like Dominion with a purpose. Instead of just collecting those VP cards, you have to do more to earn your VP points (mainly, fight monsters)! I've only played the solitaire variant (hard to get this on the table with my non-gamer friends), so I'm judging it mostly on that aspect, but the sessions have been tense, fun, and a real challenge. Sometimes you'll get a random village that will have no shot against the dungeon (one of the big flaws), but not that big of a deal..... just set up a new village and try again. Many of the card combinations are really interesting, and the game just drips with theme. I've invested in all of the first series expansions, so I'll have tons of replay out of this game for many years to come, trying out new village and hero combos against as many dungeon combos. Always a blast to play.

I'm not sure why this is so popular -- I had a really hard time even desiring to finish my first play.  If I ever play it again we'll see if something went wrong, but I was playing with experienced players and I just didn't see where the fun was.  *UPDATE*  Played two-player with my son and we thought it was a lot better than the last time.  With the starting setup of monsters and items things flowed a lot better.  I have no idea if they had some expansion thrown into the other game but this was a lot more varied and interesting.  We got through the game fine but it was a bit long.

It's surprisingly good for a deck builder, and I enjoyed playing it despite not liking deck builders all that much. I also claim to not be that into themes, but I do have to say that the theme of this does suck you in. You do feel that you're building up a few adventurers through your deck and trying to do a better job of killing off the monsters that makes it far more fun than simply collecting victory points (ala Dominion). Also, it plays pretty fast.

After game 6:

Epic Thunderstone with Nir, Doron and Hila.

Had a good start and mid game, clearing all the militia and other junk with the Trainer and Sage. Got a couple of good Drarve Fighters and lots of weapons.

Rolling boulders and bar bowls killed 4 of my heroes...

Still I got ~38 points, place 1 or 2.

------------
After game 4:

Great game.

Got the Thunderstone, but Doron beat me by 1 point.
Completely different strategies: Mine - get only big fat monsters (only 6 total, for 26pts). His - get every tiny monster (around 14, for 30 pts).

Need to work on the deck thinning strategy - used the trainer to thin militia, but kept torches and iron rations till the end. Not enough firepower, not enough gold.

Also, did not get enough gold producing cards early, so got stuck without serious buying ability for most of the mid-game.

Need to search for pre-arranged themed 'packs' of monsters/heroes/village, for better synergy.

-------------
After game 3:

A very engaging and interesting game. Throughout the 2.5 hours you are in a complete focus of ever improving and fine tuning your deck, balancing attack, light, money and victory points.

A great pleasure to reach a quite functioning deck - although it seems that there is so much room for improvement here.

Winning with 31 VPs helps, of course, but it was fun throughout the game before we counted VPs.

Strangely the monsters in the deck did not hinder the progress as much.

After game 2:

Very good game - I still suck at it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A deck-building game very much like Dominion, but with
- a better-integrated theme (dungeon crawl: buy weapons and hire people in the village, then go off and fight the monsters in the dungeon
- longer play time: both setup and game play take signficantly longer
- more complicated rules: more icons on the cards (light, gold value, strength, weight, experience), more stuff to deal with (e.g., have to have enough strength to use a particular weapon)

1 play, 4er: we had big bad monsters come up early, so we played many many turns with very little actually happening (a bunch of village turns). Don't underestimate the value of light, or you'll end up never being able to fight anything (once all the light sources are bought up by other players)!

I think I may like this better than vanilla Dominion, but need to try it again.

Thunderstone is a dungeon-themed deck building game. It has a different feel than it's popular rival Dominion and is way, way more thematic. 

Ultimately, I traded the game away because I own enough deck building games to satisfy my appetite in the genre. That, and they went ahead and released an advanced version of which fixes or adds to (whatever way you want to look at it) many elements in the base game.

Owes a huge debt to Dominion of course.  I love deck building games though, so I'm glad to see Dominion inspired games.  There is still plenty of creativity and thought that went into the design here too.  I'm not into the fantasy theme, but here it's not overwhelming enough to prevent me from really enjoying the game.  A minor knock is there seems to be a little more luck involved here with which monsters appear by the time it gets to your turn, at least in a 5 player game, and the game itself seems to move a little slower than Dominion.  Still, I had a great time playing it.  I wasn't sure about it due to the fantasy theme and it definitely surpassed my expectations.

RATING: 6
This game is essentially Dominion but with more options, unfortunately that slows this game down to a slog when compared to Dominion and takes a lot of the simple, elegant fun out of the game.  It is still a fun game with a little more theme and it's nice to play a deck-builder with a different feel and goal but a competitor with Dominion for my heart, it is not.

Like most deck-building games I feel it gets stale after enough plays without buying the expansions.

I went ahead and purchased Thunderstone Advance recently.  Hopefully the brand new card set and tweaked rules will reinvigorate my interest in the game.

It does not have the finesse of Dominion, but Dominion does not have the fun of Thunderstone.

Less clever card interaction - more of a strategic feel to deck creation. and no endless actions! Player turns much quicker than Dominion.

After a couple of plays i think this might be a little rough around the edges - but what great entertainment. A great step for the 'build a deck; mechanic.

The more i play the more depth i find and having feared it is fun but might run out of interest after a few plays it is still revealing depths and different dungeron combinations need very different deck solutions

Played the Ipad app a lot.

RATING: 7.5
I see why people are comparing this to Dominion.  I think it is because they are virtually the same bloody game!  I can’t even understand the argument that this is ‘completely’ different.  The only thing ‘new’ that Thunderstone offers is the theme and a new resource called ATTACK.  The ATTACK resource is how you buy(kill) VP’s (in the form of monsters).  

The addition of that resource does impact strategy quite greatly though.  In Dominion, you are building a deck and for the most part trying to make it so you can purchase provinces.  Well, the building of the deck revolves around the accumulation of money and purchasing.  Well, in Thunderstone. you have to balance your purchasing power with attack power.  You need gold to buy better attacks and you need attacks to buy (kill) monsters.  So it offers an interesting twist.  

I’ve only played twice, so my experience may be skewed, but in conclusion, the comparison to Dominion is not only expected, it would be criminal not to.

RATING: 4
My comment was redacted because the page refreshed.  It was running a little long, anyway.

Part of the problem in this game came from the cards reading one way, but the rules almanac asking you to play another way that seemed illogical.  For example, a dwarf that equips an edged weapon still retains the +2 Attack even if he later loses the weapon due to reduced strength?  It was little discrepancies like this that added up over time and made me unsure of my grip on the rules.  I really have no interest in reading and memorizing the almanac entry for every card to make sure I'm doing it correctly, so I would probably only play again with somebody who was well-versed in the game.

Another part of the problem was the random distribution of the cards during setup.  Although it does increase the replay value to an insane amount, it can create some very unbalanced and unfun games.  Few of the games we played ever took the 45 minutes it states on the box.  Most of the time, we either got a bunch of kickass heroes and village cards and some very easy monsters to demolish, resulting in some quick, unsatisfying 20-30 minute games, or we got a deck of huge, bad monsters and deficient heroes/village cards, resulting in hour and a half slogs as we finally started putting monsters on the bottom of the deck just to move the game along.

Fun deck-building game. Better theme than Dominion, but the graphic design takes a bit to get used to as you play. It is far too easy to mix up the cost and how many coins the card would provide if in your hand.

An enjoyable variation from Dominion and I'm curious to see what they do with the expansion.

After my first couple of plays, I was delighted with this game, and thought it was better than Dominion. The theme is more appealing, and it was fun seeing the different moster and hero types the first time around. My rating plummeted after a few more plays, though. Aggravation with the poorly written rules contributed to that, as did the fact that the game apparently didn't get the same excellent development and testing that Dominion benefitted from. It doesn't work as well or as consistently.

The biggest problem, though, is that I came to see theme (which I had initially seen as a plus) as a liability. If I want to kill monsters in a dungeon, I'll play Claustrophobia by choice. If not that, I'd prefer Descent, Castle Ravenloft, Dungeon Run or whatever. Even Cave Troll (an area control game) feels closer to the mark than Thunderstone.

My difficulty is that the monsters in Thunderstone pose no risk, so I don't feel like I'm in an adventure. Instead, I'm checking my inventory for light points and power snacks to see whether I should kill something now or make another shopping run at the village first.

No risk means no excitement. When I do fight something, I know in advance that I'll win. I'm not fighting for my life, I'm shoppping for points. This is a dungeon delving game for supply clerks, not for warriors. After 7 plays, I've had more than enough. Traded.

decent deck-building game with great thematic elements.  Runs long for what it is, and needs more card-action.  More player interaction isn't overly necessary but probably wouldn't hurt.  It's nice since I'm burned out on Dominion after playing nearly every lunch hour for the past three months.

The rules are pretty abysmal and really poorly laid-out--the newer rules posted online are a big help in that regard.  The cards are poorly designed for introducing new players, but are plenty adequate once you've played the game a time or two.

If you like fantasy themes and you like the basic mechanics of a deck-building game similar to Dominion, and you can tolerate the luck that can hamper the best-built decks, then this game is a worthy addition.

I was *very* unsure about getting this one, but I'm *very* glad I did. It fits our gaming group extremely well: fairly short, definite end-point, not a huge amount of "screw you" available, but just enough to satisfy our more aggressive players.

LIKE
+ Great use of the deck building mechanic with only 3 choices of action per turn; village, dungeon or rest.
+ The theme is overused (fantasy) but well integrated into the game with light, strength, heroes and monster type, weapons, spells, etc.
+ Great art on the cards and great variability of cards.
DISLIKE
- Graphic design of the card is pretty bad with little indication of what does what. Plus everything is so muddy and dark. I get that it's a vibe there are going for, but it sacrifices a lot of functionality.
- The previously mentioned design graphic design gives the card a learning curve that shouldn't be there on top of dealing with what's offered in the village.
- Some weird combos (like Selurin) that were left in (or not properly tested?).
VERDICT
To me, double the fun that Dominion is with a much more interesting play and replay value. Expansion are easy to get cheaply and renew the game greatly.

The dungeon-crawl theme is really good and the great art helps the theme to work. Unfortunately the game is too slow, with a lot of monsters in your deck later in the game deck management seems difficult, more so with strong monsters to fight. A really good idea but it doesn't work perfectly.

Good theme play.  Game set-up and play is similar to Dominion. There are some interesting mechanics, such as the dungeon and hero leveling up.  Game play depends heavily on the the cards choosen during game set-up.  A balanced mix of heroes, spells, items, weapons and light is needed.  The components are very good.  The cards are somewhat durable and the artwork is above average.  The rulebook is fairly well written, and in color.

RATING: 6.5
[AEG 2009 edition] {Adventure; deck-building, card-drafting; optimal 4p} Thunderstone adopts the system from Dominion.  The twist here is that players play all cards in the hand, rather than selected ones.  It was quite fun for dungeon crawler fans.

Thunderstone has a strong theme.  User interaction is ok and replay value is good.  Luck of draw is not strong.  Players have to make meaningful decisions to get good scores.  In all, it is a nice game.

However, I still traded this away. Firstly, I prefer Dominion more, which is more elegant and original.  Secondly, Thunderstone is too long for what it is.  Thirdly, my friends don't like this much as Dominion.  Finally, I expected that I have to spend a lot to get its expansions for more interesting games.  Giving shelf space is limited, I have to give it up.

The card illustration is so-so.  It may be a personal taste but I hope that they would be better in future expansions.

Rating after 2 plays. First game was disappointing because it took a lot longer to play than Dominion and didn't seem to have the variety of card combos. 

But second game was a lot quicker (1 hour) and more strategic once we understood the value of the village weapons/items and the true worth of the upgradable skills of the heroes.

A marked difference from Dominion and enjoyable on a different level. Won't appeal unless you like fantasy.

Will rate properly after more plays.

Dominion done different. In the first couple of plays, you're invariably comparing & contrasting, and while some elements feel "wrong", others actually feel like improvements. The theme does nothing for me. I'm just not a dungeon-crawling sort of guy. Some rules felt fiddly, most felt fine. The speed of playing your hand was both a blessing (less of those action+action+... turns) and a disappointment (it often felt a simple choice to go the dungeon or the village). The random nature of the monsters (with their quite widely differing VP) also felt a little irritating at times: since only 3 monsters are available to fight, your awesome killing ability hand can sometimes be wasted, while your opponents get lucky and get richer pickings.

Dominion Fantasy, which is a good thing, but while the gameplay is more complex, in the sense of having more rules, there seem to be less meaningful decisions. Compared to Dominion the deckbuilding is more linear and more forgiving, and the interaction is even lower. 

This is not the game that will replace Dominion.

RATING: 6
This is actually a very fun game, using the idea of building a deck of cards to recruit heroes and fight monsters. I like the variety and choices in building the deck. However, the card balance is almost non-existent. I'm fed up with useless cards that are never worth using. The rules are a mess, and while AEG is trying to fix the problem, they keep adding to the convolution. The game play is much better than my rating indicates, but I'm fed up with not knowing how the game works. I don't feel we can play this with a group at all; I just can't see having to go through and explain all the cards that don't do what they say they do.

I like the ideas behind Thunderstone.  I like how everything is useful in different ways so cards aren't usually dead in your hand.  I also really like the art and the idea of killing monsters in a dungeon.  And that's where it stops.

You need so many different cards to do anything and the likelihood of getting them all in your hand is not good.  So many times I had a lot of attack and no torches.  Useless.  Or I'd have low attack and torches, but none of my cards would be worth gold for the village.  And then the monsters!  Sometimes they are strong, sometimes weak.  But then they may have rediculous conditions on how to kill them.  I could go on, but I don't need to.

Great idea, bad execution.  I'll never play this again.  I don't even like Dominion anymore but I'd gladly play that over Thunderturd.

****************************EDIT*************************

I played it again and things were different this time.  The starting monster pool was picked as a learning group and the cards available were tailored to the monsters.  The idea was to give me an appreciation of the mechanics which was accomplished.

It's still not a favorite, but I'd play it if asked.  I'll up my rating to a 6.5.

Played 2+ times.  Compared to Dominion, I like the thematic additions.  I like that you can level up you heroes.  I like the amount of re-playability.  I like the dungeon delving mechanic of how you need more light to get further into the dungeon.  

However, I dislike the additional length of the game and I dislike that the monsters come out in a random order.  Therefore if there are three crappy 1 point monsters available and I kill one off, I may reveal a large monster for my left hand neighbor. All three of my opponents may have a large victory point monster to attack on their turn and when it gets back to me there may only be 3 one point monsters available for me to attack.  
**UPDATE** Have seen some neat card combos and neat card interactions but that's not enough to save the game for me. 2010-04-12

First game of this dragged on like crazy, in part because we didn't play with the recommended starter deck, so our newbie slowness was compounded by having three powerful dragons in the dungeon and right from the beginning... hard to gain experience points and progress the game.

Another deck builder, and one I'm really late to. I don't think this game is as tight a design as Dominion but I have far more fun playing it. I feel like I'm making recruiting heroes and slaying monsters rather than being shackled to engine building and VP buying. A pleasant surprise indeed and one I'll be happy to play in the future.

Own the complete set including all the promos. Do play it in Epic variant only: all decks are sharing type only but individual cards are all different.

Have kept the original division on card types the same: so that means 2 piles of weapons and 2 piles of spells, all multi-fighters in their non-fighter pile and so on. Have upped the Swarm and Phalanx monster and hero types respectively to make them actually worthwile to fight against/get. 

Other than that, it is a blast. A staple of my gaming group, it hits the table at least once a month to this date (April 2017). And that is saying a lot after 8 (!) years. Can't think of a game that will really dethrone Thunderstone as the fantasy-themed deckbuilding game to go to (perhaps LOTR complete set but missed out on that a couple of auctions ago... but even then it is a big question if that game actually would've gone down better).

Dominion with a theme! Yes it is pretty much close to dominion, but at this point Thunderstone feels much better in terms of theme and gameplay balance. You normally buy only 1 item a turn, fights a monster a turn.

Minor gripe is that you can strategically fight and lose to a monster and send it back into the deck. Now thats stupid, if not better thematically than Dominion.

Alright, I really liked Thunderstone.  I like it much better than I liked Dominion after a similar number of plays.

But also similar to Dominion, I think I might burn out on it fairly quickly.  Once you solve the puzzle, I feel like the same thing is happening where the game is driving me, rather than me driving the game.  This is not as extreme as in dominion, but it is still there, lingering in the background.  

I'd like to try that Epic Thunderstone variant some day.  Not sure when I'll get that chance though.

Not terrible. It has many usual RPG, dungeon crawl tropes, but without a "topologically interesting" dungeon, traps, or the sense of needing to push and not play safe. I think it would be improved if it cost a turn to switch from village to dungeon or back again, so the game doesn't reduce to doing the math each turn to see if you can kill something, and if not, going to the village.

Spelkort, regelböcker och spelplanen är i nästan nyskick.
Regelbok saknas till Thunderstone Base Set och Doomgate Legion. Dragonspire är dock en stand-alone / expansion och kommer med en stor, komplett regelbok som innehåller allt som basregelboken gjorde. Doomgate Legion-regelboken finns säkert att läsa på internet, men de mindre expansionernas regelböcker brukar oftast bara övertydligt förklara exakt vad varje kort gör så jag har inte saknat den.

Spelet levereras i Thunderstone Dragonspire-lådan som har hyllskav och är tejpad i ena hörnet.

Randomizer-korten finns inte, men med så här många expansions hade jag rekommenderat en app oavsett.

Very difficult game to rate. On the one hand, it is a blatant Dominion rip-off, with a few special rules thrown in, that partly seem a bit too complicated (light, strength & weight). The luck-factor is also higher and it has about the same ammount of interaction - none. Also the graphical design is a mess! OTOH, it has a cool theme, nice artwork and plays quite nicely. So it is one of my extremely rare decimal-ratings: 6.5

Another non-collectible deck building game, seems to be the year for them.

Rulebook (v1.4) not very well organized, with actual rules buried in examples, but we eventually figured it out.

Overall, the cards are gloomy, and the pertinent information does not have very high contrast. Would have liked the cards to be more legible at arm's length.

Once up and going, it was fun. The math in the Dungeon phase can be fiddly, depending on what interactions are in play.

I enjoy this particular deck building game far more than I do Dominion. Some of it may be the theme, some of it is that you get to go battle monsters OR shop, but shopping isn't the goal of the game.

Whatever it is, this game gets even better with the expansions. Some of the monsters and traps in the expansion sets are downright nasty and some of the newer combinations are really good. There always seems to be something new in the expansions, not just "more".

** Update - After playing this a ton on yucata.de I'd have to say it is one of my favorites. I'd have thought I'd get bored with it, but I don't. I will say this (especially since I have all the expansions and promos) - it is possible to get really bad villages. I don't have Thunderstone Advance since I have all the original stuff, but one thing they did correctly there was to make it so that the villages were more balanced with weapons, items, spells, etc.

La mise en place est plus lourde que Dominion, la remise en boîte est pénible, le thème est beaucoup plus présent. Est-il meilleur que Dominion? Ça dépend des goûts... Tout en se ressemblant, ils offrent des sensations différentes. Dominion est une machine qu'il faut rouler, alors que Thunderstone à un objectif beaucoup plus clair. Et la variante solo est excellente! Je suis dans le camp de ceux qui le préfère à son grand frère.

Après quelques parties, on développe une technique qui rend la mise en place et la mise en boîte pas si mal.

Although I am a fan in general of fantasy monster bashing and deck building, this fell a little flat in a couple of areas.  Firstly, there is a lot of upkeep to setting up the game in comparison to other deck building games, which already makes it less likely to hit the table.  But, the main problem is that I've seen on a couple of occasions that the game can almost completely lock up.  There can be a combination of monsters and goods available such that no one can actually slay a monster for many, many turns in a row, and this appears to be not so rare.  When it happens, the game drags on and wears out its welcome.

After several Dominion iterations have seemingly beaten the life out of a delightful fast-drafting game, I thought that Thunderstone was just going to overcomplicate the genre even further with no benefit.  I was wrong.  The dense mesh of well-conceived rules results in a more satisfying experience than Dominion.  It's too lengthy and complex for my household, but I'm impressed.  This is a whole new level.

It's a nice Fantasy-Dominion (although Dominion is quite the fantasy game by itself with some cards). It doesn't have the same depth or as many layers as there are to the intricacies of Dominion, but after all it is a fun, nicely illustrated Dungeon crawler of a different kind. Like! 

Update: I noticed something I did not like. In Dominion, every now and then you shuffle yourself a hand that is utterly wasteless. But only every now and then. In Thunderstone this happened to me throughout one whole game. I hardly had a single good hand on my turn. Now you could say my deck was screwed, but really: it wasn't that different from my opponent's decks. I put the missing depth to blame. In Thunderstone it's either good or bad, black or white, do or die. And not having the right cards on hand when the right monster's there can take a downward spiral, because up to three players inbetween you and your next turn have the chance to defeat the monsters that would be "right for you". And so on. 

Update part 2: With Ascension: Chronicles of the Godslayer and Dominion around, I don't see any room for Thunderstone. If I want to play something with more in-game depth, Dominion is incontrovertibly the game of choice. And if it's a more simple but thematical approach to this genre I am looking for, Ascension hits that spot better than Thunderstone does.

Thunderstone is a good game, and I put a lot of time into it. I think the mechanics work well, the theme is great and the deck-building is a lot of fun. I honestly don't know why I sold it. Now that Thunderstone Advance exists, I suppose I could pick that up if I felt like getting back into the game. Recently, Shadowrun: Crossfire has taken this game's place for me, while also adding persistent character building and co-op.

RATING: 7.5
A tremendous game that I'll play anytime over Dominion.  It takes much longer, but is also much more fun (in my opinion) to play.  Great game.

OK, this is a surprise.  This is the first game in a long time where it seems to me that anything associated with it would be an automatic purchase.  I haven't felt that way since Combat Commander (which I have seriously neglected recently).  

It is longer than Dominion.
It's not as "elegant" (what an overused word).
It's not as clean, or as easy to grasp on first plays.

It orchestrates the feeling of gathering your forces to plunge headlong into a dangerous dungeon.  Most of the time, you don't die (which is kind of odd for a game about fighting monsters), and it really can be a bit mechanical at times.

But every time I play, I want to play again.  And everyone I have introduced it to, including my wife, absolutely loves it.

RATING: 6
On the scale of deckbuilding games that I've played, this ranks higher than DC Deckbuilding and Marvel Legendary, but lower than Dominion and Core Worlds.

The game play is interesting because you have to choose between going to town (buying cards) or going to the dungeon (to get victory point cards) on each turn. The dungeon is made up of groups of monster cards that come out in a random order, so you always have to decide the best way to deal with each monster.

I had a couple of issues with the game. For one, it doesn't seem to scale as well as something like Dominion. There are 30 dungeon cards at any player count, so with two players you each end up with around 15 dungeon cards in your deck. Even though some of them offer a small benefit, most of the dungeon cards just take up space in your deck like VP cards in Dominion.

My other issue is that I feel much more in control in Dominion or Core Worlds. Those games usually have plenty of cards that let you draw more cards from your deck, trash cards you don't need, buy extra cards, etc. In Thunderstone, maybe we got a bad mixture of cards, but there weren't many options that let us draw more cards or pull off interesting combos. So if you drew a bad hand you were just stuck with it.

Update: I've played many more deckbuilders since my initial Thunderstone play, and Thunderstone is still near the bottom of the list. I would hope the Thunderstone Advance or Quest makes some large improvements, but I haven't played them at this time.

Feels poorly playtested, unbalanced, and requires variants to make the game more fun.  Reminds me of Space Dealer.  It seems like a fun idea for a game, but the execution is off.  

The wide range of possible and unfair "first-hands" in this game shows how ridiculous a good string of luck can be.  Certain cards combinations apparently break the game too.  Disappointment.  Rated lower, because the current average rating of the game is astronomically high for what it is.

A deck building game with a quite well integrated fantasy theme. That combination could be a winner but there are two problems for me:

1) I don't like the fantasy theme. Still, I must admit it's much better than having a totally disconected indifferent theme (like dominion).

2) It lacks the elegance. Cards make other cards useless and as there are 4-5 specific types of cards, the combos are either weak or difficult and luck is more of a factor given that you always need an all around deck. Not to mention that it lasts 45mins-1h and that's just too much for a deck building game in my opinion. 

But at least it's somewhat fun.

Based on 1 play, I found it to be a clunkier version of Dominion.  Though the theme and adding to your hero was fun, it took longer to play and felt more frustrating, as I found it harder to get a good combination of cards and there was a fair bit of building up before we were effective.  I did like leveling up and defeating monsters for victory points, but I prefer the original.

Good Deck Builder with unique game play. Like the dungeon feel, the prep and go exploring and fighting monsters. Love the light mechanic as you go darker and deeper into the dungeon. Lots of re-playability. I have the Advance version and love it. Never the same game twice.

Chris Farrell named Thunderstone his 2009 Game of the Year, which surprised me because Chris is the person who taught me Thunderstone at BGG.CON and I didn't get the impression that he, or anyone at the table for that matter, thought it was Game of the Year material at the time. Personally, I thought it was okay. I definitely liked Thunderstone more than Dominion, but that's not saying much for me. I liked how it had more of a theme than Dominion, and I liked how VP cards also gave you experience points to upgrade your fighter cards. I also appreciated the tension between attacking a monster to gain VPs and XP versus buying a card to add to your deck, whereas Dominion often lacks that tension (since Provinces are a given). All that being said, I don't really enjoy Dominion very much, so saying that I think Thunderstone is an improved version of Dominion isn't much of a compliment coming from me. I also thought a downside of Thunderstone was the card layout/design, which was unnecessarily confusing. However, the biggest downside of Thunderstone is that it doesn't use a stacked A, B, C shuffle (as in Tikal, Lowenherz, Robber Knights, etc.) for the monsters. So you can have really tough monsters early and really easy ones late, which is silly because everyone is upgrading the strength of their cards/attacks during the game, so you can whip through the monsters late and be stuck early, and a stacked/sorted shuffle seems like an easy/obvious fix. I'd be happy to play Thunderstone again, but am not dying to. Giving it Game of the Year seems a bit ridiculous though given how over-the-top derivative it is. Even if it is an improvement, it's an incremental improvement that simply further justifies throwing out your copy of Dominion, and standing on the shoulders of midgets doesn't qualify you for any awards in my books.

RATING: 5
Alright, it has more theme than Dominion, but it simply doesn't work as well as Dominion.

I find the gameplay cumbersome and lackluster. Sure, make sense get light to enter in the darker part of the dungeon, but the overall sense, for me, is that the game doesn't go foward. There are just to many turns of "waiting" (when I don't want to buy anything, to keep my deck slim enough, and also have no chance to go into the dungeon).

So the game takes longer, there is no more excitement than Dominion (you know that you will win a fight).

Thunderstone? No, just no.

I love thunderstone, surprising given that I hate Dominion... They are different games, but not massively. I think it must be the theme that atracted me to this one more in the first place. Keep meaning to play the Epic variant the Tom Vassel talks about alot.

Fails to establish an arc or differentiate different player strategies enough.

It distinguishes itself from Dominion with it's shift to a conflict based deck building game. And I do like these various frameworks to turn the deckbuilding of Dominion into a game with decisions, deck management, and sustain a narrative arc.

I wish it had artwork like Ascension's.

I'm indifferent rather than harsh here, and will gladly play it with any friend who likes it, and may find I grow to like it.

Great game but disappointed by the card quality. Such a shame as the artwork is really good. (second printing, made in china). Now Flying Frog they know how to make cards; excellent quality that really enhances gameplay. Thunderstone would easily have made a 9 or 10 rating if it came with quality cards.

That aside, game itself is good, enjoying the 1 and 2 player options - have quickly included the 2 expansions for variety. Bear in mind you will need to get them as the base gets repetitive rather quickly; I love the treasures and traps.

Purely a matter of opinion, but this game just didn't do it for me. In a four player game two of us kept getting nothing and the other two went ahead and killed monster after monster.  A lot more down time compared to Dominion if you're unlucky.  Wanted to love this game.  Crossing fingers that Nightfall will scratch this itch.

RATING: 7
A nice fantasy based deck building engine. It's a fun change from Dominion. The slightly more interaction and the separate dungeon side of the game does add length to the game. Dominion can run 20 minutes and be tense and fun. Thunderstone lends itself to more than an hour. Big trade off.

Definite Dominion knock-off,  with much better theme integration but much LESS interaction.

dual resources needed for dungeon hands (attack + light) are used to buy VP (defeat monsters), and gold is used to buy normal cards. This generally equates to the game being much more random than dominion.  Also, more than half the numbers on the card have no functional symbology to remind you of their function if you play infrequently.

less decisions, less interaction, more random, more theme.

RATING: 7
It has it's problems, but it's a decent deckbuilder to bring out from time to time.  While I can see the appeal of playing the standard way with a set number of cards to purchase, it's just so much easier to play the Epic variant once you own a few sets.

RATING: 8.5
This is one of my favorite games.  I like card games and deck building "on the fly" (vs Magic).  I like the fact that you are deck building with a specific purpose -- to kill monsters.  Granted, you can have some "bad games" where the combo of monsters, heros and items don't mesh, but all in all, it's great fun.  We do sometimes make a smaller dungeon to have a shorter game.

Not just a Dominion clone!  Thunderstone delivers much greater thematic game play.  Also, it offers more rewarding choices.  Do you go to the village and recruit and equip your party or do you venture into the dungeon and face the monsters therein?  The act of leveling up and equipping your heroes ties everything together in a way that Dominion never has.  The art in Thunderstone is much better IMO than Dominion's.  The only knock I have about Thunderstone is the packaging pales compared to Dominion.  Edit: with the first expansion the packaging issues have been solved.  In fact, this is one of the nicest put together games that I own.  

Though the rules as written are fine we play with the Richard Launius/Tom Vasel variant (with a couple of tweaks by myself).  We throw all the cards together in piles.  1 pile of light cards, 1 pile of food cards, 3 piles of weapons cards (separated into blunt, bow and edged), 2 piles of villagers (1 mercenary and 1 regular), 5 piles of heroes (separated by class: archer, cleric, fighter, thief, and wizard), 2 piles of spells and one pile of magic weapons/items, and the regular piles of torch, dagger, food and militia (plus a pile for elite militia).  We set up the dungeon with 40 random monster cards in this order 20 level one with 1 random trap or treasure, 10 level 2 with another random trap or treasure, finally 7 level 3 monsters and 3 guardians with a third trap or treasure. We found we got stuck when the first 2nd level cards come out. By having extra level 1 cards we could get more equipment and level up more heroes before the level 2 cards arrive. Our games were actually quicker with 40 cards than with 30. Our games have been running about 2 hours.  This variant makes a great game epic.

Interesting.  Don't really have a good feel for it yet, particularly with the random setup.  Maybe we should randomize half and keep the other (halves determined randomly?).

Going to start this one as a seven.  I like building the adventurer deck but haven't quite gotten around to liking the monster deck yet.

Laurie's liking this one better now.

This one is probably headed for an eight.  Only thing we haven't really liked is when the monsters and village goods randomly conspire to make the early killing difficult.  Some of those games can feel long.

But now there's Thundermaster.

The reboot really killed this one for us.  We're weren't going to pay again for only slight changes so we have just the new base and almost all of original.

RATING: 7
This game is quite inferior in gameplay to Dominion, but the theme makes it addictive.  I'm always eager to play it, even though I know it's not really that great of a game.

Some cards are unbalanced, and that can be a problem in this game, since the goal doesn't change too much from game to game.  Almost any every dungeon you fight will require a little magic.  Clerics may be useful in some dungeons, but they are never completely necessary.  So, unlike Dominion, you can play every game the same way, and still be in the running for winning.

EDIT: After finding the rules for Epic Thunderstone, I've raised it to a 7.  It would probably be an 8 or 8.5 if it was published with the Epic Thunderstone rules.

A colorful and well balanced card game. Its a different  every time you play and it's a game where you build your own deck as the game progresses.

Because I know you're expecting it, here's the inevitable comparison to [gameid=36218].  It's more complex, which means its a better game at heart, but it definitely sacrifices length for it.  Core concepts of deckbuilding is neat, and this game puts several different currencies out there.  Attack is the way you get VPs and XP, gold is the way you add cards to your deck, and XP is the way you improve the cards in your deck.  This game is MUCH more thematic than Dominion.  The concepts of light, weapons, and heroes, while overused, did make a lot better connection with the mechanics than +1 buy, +1 draw, etc.  Thunderstone also has a better decision process through the game, as there is more than just planning out your strategy upon seeing the initial card layout.  Still, I'm not quite sure that I like the mechanic enough to offset the length.  My choice for this genre is still [gameid=69789].

Rating is for the entire Thunderstone series. One of my three favorite deckbuilders (along with Ascension and Legendary).

(11/09)  After one 5p game I am intrigued to play this one again.  Our 5p game dragged on for many reasons - the main one being that I had to leave by a certain time.  Our game went the full 30 monsters and felt like a marathon - some player AP - lots of buying items rather than fighting monsters by some players, etc.   But I can see the theme shining through as future games unfold and experienced game play helps speed it up.  I want to play this one some more and with fewer players too.

UPDATE: Suffers in comparison with Puzzle Strike and Ascension. It's clunky and ugly-looking, and takes ages.

Deck-building game with lots of card variety in the base set and a clear theme. It's a dungeon delve in a card game.

When we got it, a friend came around and played it four times in quick succession. I promptly bought the expansions.

It's not as mechanically elegant as something like Dominion and takes longer. But it can be more silly and fun, and more of an experience.

The card variety does generate some weird/ugly combinations of equipment, heroes and monsters. We've played games where the heroes haven't seemed strong enough to beat the monsters in the dungeon, or where key equipment has been missing. For example, no magical items to buy in the village and physically-immune monsters. Or a hero that benefits from big equipment, and no weapons available to buy.

If this causes a problem, I'd recommend reshuffling and reselecting village cards. We decided it was a challenge to overcome, and had a go at playing. Made the game more interesting.

Certainly, games that build on other games can show a lot of improvement on an idea, but in a lot of cases, what happens is that the newer games take a simple, elegant design and add a lot of other mechanisms to it to make it overly fiddly, and unnecessarily complicated.  I've said this about Zooloretto, and I'll also say it about Thunderstone.  That being said, though, Thunderstone isn't really a bad game.  It takes the idea behind Dominion and turns it into something that feels completely different from Dominion.  It expands a player's choices, meaning that it requires a different way of playing the game, and a different strategy, in order to play well.  

The game can sometimes break down, if the weapons and the monsters don't balance out through a random draw of cards.  One two-player game we played took far longer than necessary, because neither of us had anything else we wanted to (or could, really) buy, but neither did we have the right weaponry to take out some of the big monsters.  Though, admittedly, we could have made an attack to bury the monsters, but it seemed counter-productive to do that.

I admire the design, and wouldn't turn down a chance to play it, just because it feels so different.  I still think Dominion gets an edge over it, due to its simplicity, but they're different enough to justify owning both.

RATING: 7
Thunderstone doesn't play as smoothly as Dominion, nor are its card interactions as deep. As a matter of fact, there really isn't much in the way of combo plays at all. Most turns consist of laying down your entire hand all at once and resolving it. If this sounds awful to you, know this, it's actually not.

Despite the relatively simplistic way that cards are resolved, the experience usually provides a lot more fun than your average game of Dominion. I don't know if it's because the theme is so immersive, such as the game allowing you to level up your drafted heroes into more powerful versions after they kill stuff, or if it's simply just more fun to kill monsters than buy property...but Thunderstone feels like a more complete effort than Dominion, especially when comparing the base sets of the two games.

I have completely switched over to Richard Launius and Tom Vasel's Epic house rules, because they stretch the theme even further and make Thunderstone an even richer experience.

To get the elephant in the room out of the way, if I had to pick only Dominion or this, I'd take Dominion. That said, there are things I think Thunderstone does better (diversity in abilities meaning that it sometimes makes sense to buy less powerful cards, the different options for each turn meaning that you're rarely "wasting" a turn), and I think they're different enough to justify having both. As far as Thunderstone on its own, I think it might be a little long for what it is, and I'm told that going purely random with setup will sometimes result in clunky games (which I could see), but all in all I think it provides a good gameplay experience, and while I think the "deckbuilding with a purpose" tagline is a bit tacky, it really does feel like you're building up to something rather than just building. (I don't think "just building" in Dominion is a bad thing, but I know some do.)

RATING: 8
Thunderstone is a definite improvement on Dominion:

1) Thunderstone seems slower paced, making it more forgiving in the early stages of the game and mitigating the gratuitous shuffling required by Dominion.

2) Dungeon delving to conquer monsters is a more interesting mechanic for victory points than simply purchasing land.

3) Rest enables all players to easily eliminate unwanted cards from their deck.  (Something which can be difficult and frustrating in Dominion.)

4) Thunderstone is more thematic.  I had reservations that Thunderstone's theme would work for a deck building game, but overall I think it fits the game play fairly well.

One thing that I didn't particularly like about Thunderstone was the implementation of traps and treasures.  They seemed to simply increase randomness rather than improve game play.

Thank you AEG for your generosity!

Long for what it offers (and I don't mind playing a 16-hour long wargame over a weekend) and underdeveloped on the verge of being broken. If you get a weak, slow setup and some strong monsters to begin with you spend half an hour shuffling your decks before someone kills something and clears the way. This isn't just a matter of me not liking the game, this is obvious poor design.

First I thought this was just a Dominion clone but after a few games it became obvious that there's enough difference to play both. Dominion is more balanced and elegant but Thunderstone is more relaxed because keeping track of the score progression is less obvious than in Dominion. That way Dominion is more in your face and more competitive, Thunderstone can feel almost like a co-operative game.

I've been playing this one solo, and the advantages are that it is more thematic than Ascension yet less fiddly than Shadowrift. The main disadvantage is that setup is as much of a pain as Dominion, which is a problem when gaming solo because I have to do all the work myself. Also, I'm still trying to find the right difficulty level to make it properly challenging. Playing with the vanilla solo rules seems far too easy.

We own all of the Thunderstone expansions.

We enjoy Thunderstone, with its expansions (including the newer 'Advance' expansion), and we play it using the 'Randomizer' app, and NOT using the 'Epic' varient. We think Thunderstone is just swell the way it is. We find the variety each game offers to be suited to our style of play, and the different types of challenges each game proposes with each new set-up.

RATING: 9
Similar to Dominion, but Thunderstone blows it away in almost every aspect.  There's a ton of theme with the various monsters in the dungeon.  It's fast-paced with virtually no downtime, since everyone's turn goes quickly and you prepare for your own turn while the others are taking theirs.  But most of all, the difference is the dungeon - every turn you have a choice of battling monsters in the dungeon or adding heroes, spells, weapons, or accessories from the village.  There's randomness because of the shuffling each turn to produce your hand, but it's still up to you to create a deck that is versatile enough to work with most combinations that can come up.  There's annoying setup similar to Dominion (but mitigated if you organize the cards when you put it away), and the stats on the cards are not marked intuitively, so you just have to remember what each number or marking means.  Despite the nitpicks, still great overall.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Has a more palatable theme than Dominion (a plus), but is simultaneously more complex and more random than its predecessor (a minus).  The result is a wash, so Thunderstone gets the same rating.

My biggest complaint: Players have no control over which monsters are available to attack on their turn, yet the ability to kill these monsters is critical to winning.

As far as the deckbuilder genre goes, I like this more than Dominion. 

You basically build a team of heroes and equip them with weapons and spells and then go the dungeon and kick some monster butt.

I always want more player interaction in these types of games, but it just doesn't seem to happen. Deckbuilders always feel like a bunch of people playing the same game separately while taking turns. I never really care or watch what other players are doing because I can't really do anything about it.

Fun game once it gets rolling. Killing monsters is a nice change from buying land. A few holes that will hopefully get filled by expansions, but good effort. Time to play goes down a decent chunk with repeated plays, but will probably always take longer than Dominion.

The Epic variant is a nice spin on the game. Instead of a limited pool of resources, you never know what will pop up regarding monsters or weapons or items. 

As time goes on, this doesn't get played enough to match the investment and I'm not sure it will. There are just better card games for me to play than this.

The rules as written feel like an inferior game to most modern deckbuilders, and even the mother of the genre, Dominion. Thunderstone is much longer with less bang for your buck. Sure, I love the theme and graphics of Thunderstone, as an old roleplayer it's a great fit, but the gameplay fails to live up to its promise.

The [filepage=70684][b]Epic Thunderstone[/b][/filepage] variant devised by Richard Lanius, and evangelized and modified by Tom Vasel improves the game somewhat, but there is too little XP currency in the game when not being allowed to buy level 2+ Heroes and that slows the game down further, and sucks all the fun out of it. I've tried to address this with my own variant of [filepage=70684][b]Epic Thunderstone[/b][/filepage].

I may rate Epic Thunderstone with my variants a 7, while the regular game only deserves a 4.

[b]THE FLAMING SWORD:[/b]

1. Excellent artwork.
2. The greatest theme a geek could wish for, other than Star Wars, I suppose.
3. Great deck building mechanisms.
4. Lots of cool decisions.
5. Varying paths to victory.
6. Huge amount of variation - expansions can only improve this.
7. Training a dungeon-delving team (as a Gandalf-like figure) and then setting them loose is fun - even it's an abstract-ish way of playing D&D.
8. Rules and abilities fit the theme, and not the other way around.
9. Expandable - not collectable.

[b]THE NOXIOUS SLAG:[/b]

1. Dominion clone.
2. Crappy rulebook. Though I found it easy to explain to a couple of non-gamers.
3. Some head-scratching card rule interpretations (Dwarf Jannisay, one of the Oozes, Town guard, etc).
4. No traps or tricks in the dungeon! I eagerly await an expansion to resolve this oversight.
5. No giant spiders, either. Okay, I like my dungeon complexes to house spiders and bears. No, I won't bloody keep it down!
6. Dominion is still the "purer" design, I've decided. Maybe, probably, one Thunderstone expansion might kill off Dominion for good in my group, especially if it has spiders, traps, and bears...
7. Missing a dungeon "boss" who guards the Stone itself.
8. The Thunderstone seems like an easy design shot at  a macguffin - why not have a princess or prince who needs rescuing?
9. Less deck-churning than Dominion (at the moment). Some might see this as an advantage.


Some of the comments here really shout the game down for being an unoriginal, Dominion-clone, fantasy rip-off, stand on the shoulder of giants game.

Come on, give this game a break. I feel that knocking points off a game score for not possessing an "original" design is gross stupidity. If you don't enjoy playing Thunderstone, then say so; don't slap it down for mimicing another game. No one beats up, the frankly awful, Race for the Galaxy for cloning San Juan. Most games are descendants of other designs.

The defence rests, m'lud.

I own all the expansions. More is certainly better in the Thunderstone universe. I will 'start' to get picky after Thornwood Siege expansion box. I promise!

RATING: 6.5
I am also of the opinion that this is a better implementation of the deck building mechanic than Dominion.  Yes, in this case I do believe that theme is important and I'm not just accumulating victory points for the sake of it.  There is a sense of progression (in upgrading your heroes) and purpose (killing monster for experience and VP), so it appeals greatly to someone like me that grew up and still enjoys RPG.  I don't think it's too far fetched to claim that Thunderstone is a dungeon crawler/exploration lite.

My biggest complaint is that one's experience could be greatly dampened by a combination of bad hand and monster draw.  Thereby resulting in a lot of village rounds and not enough creature slaying.  Granted this could be argued that the person simply needs to make a better and more efficient deck, but you can't deny that luck is a huge factor regardless how fine tuned your deck is.

Anyway, I look forward to the addition of different mechanics, especially other ways to obtain VP and maybe even ones that will given penalty like the curse cards in Dominion.

RATING: 7.8
First thing that comes to my mind when I read the line deck-building game, was “it’s a Dominion-clone.” And at it’s base, it is a Dominion clone. But there is more in this one, then there is in Dominion.
Dominion is very easy to explain to new players, as there are always the same steps in a players turn:

    Draw 5 cards
    You may play an action (or more if a cards allows you)
    Purchase a card (or more if a cards allows you)
    Discard your cards.

And that’s all there is in Dominion. Nothing more. Very easy, every turn the same, and still we both like it a lot. Would Thunderstone be as nice or nicer, or would it just be another clone of a succesfull game? First step was to sort the huge amount of cards that were in the box. And that was a pretty hard job to do, as we got 4 cards of a kind, then 3 of another, then 1 of the first kind, then a couple of cards of the third kind, but we managed to sort them out, and the result was a table full of small stacks of cards. Placed everything in the box (of which I have to say, I like the solution Dominion gives more. The dividers delivered with the game, are just too small to look up the cards easy.), and started to set up the first game. We used the cards that were recommended in the rulesbook (ver 1.4). And started the game after reading the rules and explaing them to M..

It took us almost 2 hours to play our first game. We had several things to look up (what does a card do/mean?), but we both enjoyed it very much. My conclusion is that I think that it is a better game then Dominion is. M. is not sure about that. Mainly because of the difficulties she has with the English text on the cards. It’s harder for her to understand it, then it’s for me. Most of the cards were pretty clear to me, so I could explain them to M.. Why do I think it’s a better game then Dominion is? Well, that’s pretty easy to explain. I think it’s better then Dominion, just because of one word. And that word is or. That same word makes the game harder to explain to people, because those two letters give you such a lot of possibilities. Let me explain.

A players turn starts and ends the same way a turn in Dominion starts and ends.  Draw cards and discard your cards. And then comes the word or in the game.

    You can make a purschase or
    You can enter the dungeon or
    You rest

If you decide for the first option, then it’s just like Dominion. You may play an action and purchase a card (additionaly, you can upgrade a hero).
If you decide for the second option, you count your attack value, and you try to fight a monster (after resolving the monster cards).
If you decide for option three, you destroy a card (which can be handy, because you can get rid of the cards you don’t like anymore).

While in Domion, you just buy victory points, in Thunderstone you have to decide what to do. Go for VP’s, or make you deck stronger by purchusing or destroying cards. Sometimes it’s a really tough decision you have to make. You have the money needed for the one card you really want to have, but you can also fight a monster and get the VP’s, while in your next turn it might be possible that you could do neither of them. These, sometimes difficult, decissions makes it a better game for me then Dominion is. I’m sure the same will count for M., when she understands all of the cards. That Thunderstone is a harder game then Dominion, becomes already clear by just looking at the playing time. 60 minutes for Thunderstone agaist 30 minutes for Dominion. I just have to decide what to do for the sollution with the dividers. Buy the expansion in which they are in, or make them myself. If it’s up to me, it’s going to be the first sollution.

Thunderstone comes off as a dungeon-crawl Dominion. The mechanics are very similar, but Thunderstone has far more immersive gameplay. It is more fun to play for the experience.

The problem with this game is that it is significantly less streamlined than Dominion. There are a lot of cards flying around, and most of them get in the way at least half of the time. For rookie players it usually means ending up with an awful deck while the others march through the dungeon.

I've heard much good about some of the expansions, I'm guessing it could make the game a lot more enjoyable.

I think I've been looking at it too much from a deckbuilding point of view, and not enough as a dungeoncrawler using cards (which is pretty much what it has become).

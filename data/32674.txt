I have a Series 1 Rise monster booster pack.  It's the Ares Mothership and Ultra Ares Mothership.  Both have original plastic around them, though not sealed.  No cards or anything, just monster figs.

Brilliant design, really captures the feel of the Kaiju battle.  Artistic design is wonderful and the units are well sculpted and painted. 
I've been playing this for well over one year now, and even without the new sets, I still don't think I would have gotten tired of it by now.  It's a good quick game, but with lots of decisions and tension involved.

An excellent and unique minis game. I am bummed about the collectible aspect, but it is still worth it. The game has some interesting resource management aspects and does a terrific job of representing the theme through both mechanics and special powers. A fantastic offering from Privateer Press!

CULL
The only thing I hate more than miniatures or collectible games is a collectible miniatures game.  And the game is seriously encumbered by its over-reliance on iconography; this game is the object lesson in why icons can produce a clean, simple-loooking "interface" that is brutally difficult to learn and use.

Despite these serious flaws, there just may be a good game here;  time will tell...

Eh, forget it:  There's no doubt a very good game here, but it's utterly lost in the implementation.    An over-reliance on dozens of MONOCHROME ICONS means the only "game" here is trying to recognize the icon, look it up in some reference, and then try to remember why you were looking it up in the first place.   Repeat until one player wins by throwing the game off the table in frustration.

As bad as this production flaw is, it's compounded by the fact that these icons are recessed into the base of the minis, so you essentially have to play this standing up.

Finally, the coup de crap:  Each player's faction has their own extensive set of unique icons.  So good luck trying to understand what that mini next to yours is capable of.....

So, to recap:  great game, horrific execution.  Unplayable.

Move big monster than move small monster. Fight it out over a city landscape..... Felt very B movie like, or Godzilla like.

Interesting concept but I did not feel its fun in anyway. Great minis though.

RATING: 6
AWSOME Game. The way a monster bash game should be. I would say. for a CMG no useless units. I WANT every piece! (not usually for me in any collectable game).

This feels like a complete and awsome boardgame thats broken down into a CMG. I dont crusify PP for doing it this way. Because it might be a very costly boardgame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game that starts to get bogged down the more units are used.  I recommend players limit their units to 10 instead of 15 to keep the game fast and monster focused.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The theme is fantastic.  The basic play mechanic works and works well.  The "power" moves make the game and capture the feel of every giant monster movie you've ever seen.  The bits are stunning!

Now, the bad.  It's collectible and expensive ($15 for 4 units and a building?).  The figures use an icon system which is complex and requires constant checking into the quick reference guide to figure out what a figure's ability is.

Overall, a good game, but the icon system makes it very difficult to introduce to non miniature game players.

RATING: 6.2
The mechanics are very interesting, but our first game was a little on the bland side. I scored a few hits on my opponent and after that it seemed like he couldnt do much to catch up.
Maybe it's just because we didnt quite grasp the game on that first try.

Rather steep learning curve with all the ability icons but Monsterpocalypse has amazing depth and replayability. For a collectible game there are also surprisingly few really bad monster matchups. I'm sure I have more like 100 plays from before I started recording on BGG.

Purchased initial starter set. Lots of fiddly stuff to keep track of. Rules a bit confusing/unclear; I decided to hold off further purchases until better rules set came along. I never did get back to the game. Initial impression still favorable-lots of potential.

RATING: 9
I'm hooked.  I was pretty wary of the game, since it's ANOTHER collectible miniatures game, and that does tend to get on my nerves.

But the game play is fun, the collectible part isn't too terrible (although the 4 unit miniatures to a booster is a bit low in my opinion), and it's actually deep enough to be a good, decision filled game.  

The game has the right fit of Monster vs non-Monster action- monsters are tons more powerful, but you'll need the units to handle various tasks, and they can do an occasional point to the monsters.  The Faction system is done well enough to make it easy to make a playable army (since any 15 units can work).  There's plenty of dice to roll, but a few ways to increase your odds, and there is resource management available aside from sheer manpower.

Highly recommended, just hope I can get all I want of Set 1 before Set 2 comes out!

Love this game! The monsters are great. Gameplay is fun. A bit thinkier than I thought a monster smashing game would be. But, for me, it turns out that this is a good thing!

Edit: Lowered my rating a bit. I like the game, but it is too hard for me to remember all the powers if I don't play it a lot. Which we don't.

Awesome minis game which is lightly collectible. Get the battle box two-player starter and you have everything you need to play.

The one disappointment is the minis needed to have stat cards. Sure, everything you need is on the base, but there are so may icons that it is hard to just look and remember what the figures can do. There are some nice cards available here and at other places which have all the info you need. Print them out and you'll have an easier time learning the game.

Took one look at the rules, and decided it was going somewhere. Giant monster movies may have a reputation as campy and low-budget, but this game isn't that. The minis are the best pre-paints out there IMHO, and the rules are complex enough to satify number-crunchers along with building-crushers. The biggest problem, in fact, is learning curve: it'll take a few games before you stop checking the reference card every turn for some obscure icon or other. Having gotten over that hump, however, I see a wide open cityscape spread out before me. Time to stomp some skyscrapers!

(Deducting 1/2 point for collectibility: a sealed case will give you a full set of the appropriate models, which I consider pretty good as collectibles go. I've also started judging tournaments at my FLGS.)

RATING: 5
Giant monster brawl genre brought to you for tabletop goodness. Sadly though its a CMG, but it's a great CMG. Selective buying of singles online helps. this one has a great design, theme and game play and awesome minis.

Yes lets be honest this game can get expensive. Start off with getting 2 starters. Then hit the online miniature shops. Popular Collections is a good place.
 You can get a decent amount of select pieces, enough maybe for 2 players with different faction monsters and the games limit on units for each, and structures and you can leave it at that. Which honestly may bring it to $260 bucks out of your pocket (starters added in), honestly better than the alternative constant booster buying.

Also don't forget the more buildings you have the better the game goes. I suggest 8 or more for each player to set into the game.

After reading the rules, and playing other CMGs this one takes the cake for complexity, but in a good way, you can play it with its basic rules, or add in some real fun with the abilities, power attacks and such. Understandably though since this one incorperates more things to do in the game, first time plays have a habit of rules checks and rechecks, so don't be discouraged the first few times. Overall It's like a giant spice rack full of different spices to add to the flavor of how to pummel your enemies.

The play map mats are made of paper, I would prefer a thin sheet of durable plastic paper for the play mats to make the price you pay in minis worth it as paper mats will fall apart after constant use and folding. Unless you laminate the maps, which make them harder to fold. The dice worry me a little. Their symbols are painted on. Ive had issues from other games with painted on icons. They usually wise up and make updated versions to buy online with the ingraved lazer cut icons into them. So who knows the paint may rub off over time on these dice.

I still highly recommend it for some smashin' fun!
2 player games are fun. But 4 player games (2 on 2) Same Faction or Agenda brawl  I'm itching to try!

RATING: 8
As cool as this game looks, it's even more fun to play.  It has a surprisingly steep learning, curve though -- the power interactions are probably more complex than something like Magic: The Gathering, and there's no helpful text on the figures to help you remember them!

UNplayable with a single "basic" set.  But, that didn't stop me from pulling out my Godzilla figures, and the playdoh Gozilla city for buildings. (and different colored dice).  I also threw out all the rules about special junk.  I would not consider it "dumbing down", it is more like "muggle-izing".
Oh....I love the parts.  But I HATE collectible components.

I forgot about the rule that if you have two coins in your left pants pocket on a Tuesday in Spring with a 1/2 phase moon, that all dinosaur monsters that are pink may optionally crush an opposing unit with 3.14159 spaces....if it is in the line of sight.

Surprisingly deep game play, and the game looks terrific on the table.
The factions are all distinct in looks and feel. 
Overall, an impressive design !
The "collectibility" is no longer an issue with the release of the 2-player starters. 
Anyway, to complete your factions forget about the boosters and buy singles from the first series which can  be found for a reasonable price and play just fine.
EDIT : the game is no longer collectible !

So getting back into this a bit, the problem is too dang many icons on everything, it's too much to just get into casually.  Need to get some REALLY good player aids to make this work.  We're leaving out all building powers for now and sometimes we just can't figure out what an icon does so we ignore it.

I LOVE the minis and factions for this game, but the rules are just too damn fiddly and complicated for casual play, especially the ZILLIONS of goddamn abilities on literally every model and piece of terrain. Despite its lightish theme and cartoony look, this game is much more aligned with the realm of crunchy, granular war games than standard board game fare. Currently working on building an airtight collection, and then slamming the door shut on this game...

I frikken love this game.  It is collecty right now, but will be non collectible soon.  The game is simple, but the special abilities are too vast for the theme.  That said, I love a game that gives you a bajillion different ways to mash a monster on/over/through buildings.  The dice mechanic is genius and the bits are drool worthy.
March 2012: Sadly, no one else in my group of friends feels the same level of love for this, so I have sold everything.  However I still have a laminated Block War Map and a laminated Voltron map if you would like to trade for something.
September 2012: Friends are getting into it, so SO AM I! WOO!

RATING: 6
Might be a four if not for the theme.  The action dice mechanic is pretty clever, and it is neat how your units are playing a separate game to keep your monster juiced.  But the core of the game is just the idea that you moving the other guy two spaces is really cool.  

The unit side of the game is great; if it were its own game I would love it.  A CityFight BattleTech game or something.  But instead they are meant as resources for the lame part of the game.  I want to keep the red dice and turbo-charge my tanks to fight his lizards.  The monsters just get in the way.

Alas, Monsterpocalypse, I had such high hopes. I first saw and tried this game at Gencon in 2008 (or 2009?) and I absolutely fell in love with it. I think PP did an amazing job with this game. I mean, it was like no other game I had ever played, it had such depth and coolness. The dice mechanics, the powers and abilities, the monster power attacks, the smashing of buildings...I thought I had found the holy grail of miniature gaming. When series 4 came out I had a heroin moment and spent over $300 on a case of monster and unit boosters. 
And now for the tragic ending...I just could not find anyone to play this game with me. NO ONE was playing this game. I have no idea why. My son and I played it sometimes but at the time he was very young and it was too much to ask of him. My wife refused to play it. And now it sits in my closet...*sniff*

Several of us bought into this thinking it would be a quick two player filler game but we all found it very overlong for what we were wanting.

It quickly gets into a situation where you or your opponent get some hits and damage on the other monster and then spend about 45 minutes chasing it down again as that monster has to run away.

The dice management mechanic is very nice.

RATING: 8.5
Damn expensive, but I just couldn't pass on the whole thing. Giant monsters, cool minis, destroying cities and the strategy elemnet. Geek heaven.
________________________________________________________

The game seems to have a lot of options to tinker with and tough choices to make. It's much more strategic than I expected, but is still quite random at the same time.

The game is similar to Battlelore and Heroscape in both the cool factor (looks great after setting up) and the dramatic narrative it unravels during play. What differs it from those games (both of which I enjoy) is the depth of play and  the much richer strategy element.
________________________________________________________

This is a great game. Very exciting and deeper than I expected.. And I just LOVE the theme.. GIANT MONSTERS ARE THE NEXT BEST THING AFTER ZOMBIES!
________________________________________________________

I've made tons of pretty cool unit tokens for almost all the agendas (except NOW) to use as proxies for the units I don't have. I've printed out summary cards for all units, monsters and buildings. I've also made some extra paper buildings and custom rubble and fire hazard tokens. This way the game is much less expensive.
________________________________________________________

What I don't like about MONPOC:
- the price
- blind purchases and the collectable aspect
- they reuse the same sculpts too much (I expect more variety for that much money)
- they don't provide players with summary cards for the figures (frankly, I can't imagine playing without them)
- they could have made the graphic design of the maps and the rubble and hazard tiles more diverse.

Collectible minis (yuck) thankfully you can buy full sets now. However, there are a plethora of tiny icons on each monster and a two page key using 6pt font describing them. It is a beer and pretzels game that has way too many rules and "special effects".

Still my kids enjoy pushing the minis around and destroying cities.

RATING: 5
Positive: 1- Great theme; I like the genre. 2- Well-produced: nice looking minis, maps, buildings, etc. Like my friend said, "It sure is sweet to be able to body-slam a monster into a pool of nuclear waste!"

Negative: 1- COST!!! Like most collectable games, the cost is outrageous. Furthermore, figures are divided into factions, and members of the same faction operate much better when matched together. Thus, it is likely that you will end up with a miss-matched force or lots of figures that you don't want. Plus, if you want to play a variety of factions, cost continues to increase. 2- Large learning curve. Game has lots of "fiddly" rules and tons of icons. I feel the game could have been simplified without losing content. I am sure that many people like the huge variety of options, but flipping through the rule book to find or verify rules is overwhelming and time consuming. In all of this, I am surprised that line-of-sight is absent and cover is over-simplified. 3- Cheesey little dice that can easily be lost.

Captures the theme very well.  All of the various elements work very well together, and most games I've played so far have been real knock-down drag-out affairs, with the city usually completely ruined by the time the battle is over.  The rules are clear and easy to read, and the factions included are cool and representative of the famous monsters they are based on (Godzilla, Ultra-Man, etc.)  Lots of fun, easy to teach others, and lots of subtle strategy in the way factions function together.

RATING: 8
Oh, yeah, this is the stuff. You need lots of buildings to make it pretty and smashtastic--and once you do there are about a zillion icons to parse--but it's worth it. The interplay of units and monsters is great and makes the game what it is. Your monster is where it's at, but it won't get very far without clever unit use. Tempo and synergy are everything.

This game is just a bit too busy for my tastes. There are so many symbols and abilities to remember it gets in the way of making good decisions. I wouldn't even mind so much if I just had to keep track of my own, but it is crucial to know what each of your opponents many units can do at all times, and it is not easy to figure that out at a glance. Some stat cards instead of symbols on the base would have helped a lot. It looks really good on the table, obviously, and the theme is also fun. Gameplay feels very back and forth; a single attack can sometimes drain 2/3's of a monster's health. This makes it feel very swingy and a single die makes a huge difference. The dice pool mechanic is wonderful though and is a very clever way to make players manage their risk. I would never play this seriously, and probably never buy into it, but I can have some lighthearted fun with it occasionally.

RATING: 8
Based on one play so far. This game has potential, but I'm going to need some time to get used to the rules and unit abilities. After a second play, I definitely like this game. It's a fun system and the bits are lovely. I do have a few criticisms, though. I feel it needs an alternate ending/victory condition, as playing until your opponents' monsters are destroyed can become long and tedious, and also tends to make you focus on just attacking the monsters to the exclusion of other enjoyable possibilities. I'd rather see a turn limit with victory points accumulated by damaging monsters plus destroying units and buildings. Also, the many different power attacks get a little fiddly and are a bit much to remember for something that looks like it's trying to be relatively simple - my feeling is that they should have been special abilities granted to some, but not all, monsters. Why should Martian flying saucers be able to head-butt? But overall a very fun game with excellent presentation.

RATING: 6
Great silly fun, and the flavor is soooo right. The sculpts and paints of both the monsters and the units are great, but as odd as it sounds, I *really* love the look and design of the buildings. You basically act out a Godzilla-ish movie on the play mat. Think War of the Monsters for the PS2 as a board game. A friend picked up a bunch at GenCon, and it's neat. Grreat flavorful abilities. I like the way you pretty much alternate between monsters and units because of the shifting die pools (need more dice included with the starter, and bigger ones would be nice though). Kind of expensive though, and I knock it down a full point because of one annoying word: collectible. 

[Edit: knocked it down another point because I now get how damn expensive it is to just mount a halfway decent army; granted, on collectibles, you spend what you want, but to just play this with a decent army of units and its corresponding monster is *way* too much, even if the game itself is a blast]

My rating has gone up after about 7 plays.  This is such a well designed game between the game mechanics and the theme.  It's fun but it keeps me thinking. I love balancing the unit with the monster activations and all the decision making that involves. Also this has the best pre-painted minis that I have seen. My sons both love it too (and for my 4 year old this is a first), so this has become the game.  What's best is with all the different figures and abilities, we have only just scratched the surface.

Love the theme, love monsters destroying cities, love the miniatures, love the grid based city maps, love all the factions. HATE that it is being sold as a collectable, HATE the random box draws. Ingenious game mechanic, one of a kind game, it is cool cool cool, but you have to learn a second language to play - hyroglyphics.  Hundreds of symbols, and very painful during the first few games until you start to read the hyroglyphs.  Already dumped too much money into this game, and I only have half of the units I want. Why they market this as a collectible is beyond me. It's killed many a game, why would this one be different.  I wish they would sell faction based boxes. Still a great game, very re-playable with the number of units and maps that can be used.  Very long time to really master, but simple enough to just have fun while learning it. If you like any of the 70s era monster "kaiju" themed movies, you should like this. I think I would rate it higher if I didn't get the feeling Privateer Press was just trying to rip me off with the collectable format. ;gpv;700;30

OWNED SINCE 2012
I was looking at other BBG profiles, similar to my own, and noticed a lot of people liked this game. I had never heard of it so I looked it up here on BBG and it sounded like my kinda of game. I bought two 2 player starter packs and 5 small boosters. No more. I was not wanting to get involved in a CCG that requires too much money. Besides, I only plan to play with wife and kids, so nothing uber competitive was required. My kids and I love this game, and now I want to get more MonPoc. It is a fast game, and you feel like there are lots of options and tactics to choose from during game play. This game looks like a tabletop miniature game (really cool to handle and play with) and plays like a light war game/ Heroscape/ Summoner Wars/ mix of sorts. It really feels like its own game, and hard to compare to others. It is not a light game, not at first, but it is way too simple for all of the tactical and strategic control you have. My young kids like to play this game. They do not get bored 20 minutes into the game and want to quit. My smaller kids, 5 - 7, love to just move the pieces and destroy enemies. My older kids 8 -11 get involved with tactics and have a good understanding of the game play. Every one who sees the game loves the theme. A great game for the family and highly recommended. 
    UPDATE: This is still a great game, and I have bought a lot more units and monsters. I am not trying to complete all the sets, or even any particular ones, but this game does not require that. It plays well with what I have, and I do not need to keep buying to enjoy other parts of the game. I think they did a great job with theme, background story, and models; everything fits and the game play perfect. The only downside to the game that I have noticed is poor map and dice quality. The map can be fixed with money, just laminate them at a store, and the dice can be re-painted if need be, or even given a clear coat to help prevent wear, but these are things that should never been an issue to begin with. It is not a deal breaker, just something I wished they had done better.

Was a fun game but it's a CMG so my chances of actually being able to afford it and play it are basically gone nowadays. Maybe if it had come along 10 years earlier for me like CCGs, which I don't play either now for much the same reasons.

Update:

I bought some boosters and stopped. The game IS fun actually, captures the theme, looks good. I stopped for the same reason I didn't like to buy the original 40k ccg when it was alive: 1 booster could have 1 item from any of of the 6 factions (or none); meaning? It's very pricey to build from the boosters. Very.

I hear they have a better distribution now though, but I don't know if it's true.
-----------------

Giving this a chance, but right now the I'm very disappointed in the broken figures I've gotten and the quality control I'm seeing. 

The occurrence of this has been too high for me: out of 6 boosters and 2 starter packs, there have been 3 broken figures (missing arms on 2, debased on the other), 1 figure with paint splotches on the base, and 2 almost horizontally leaning figures. 

The debased items are not a real problem for me as I have glue and that's nothing to fix. The horizontally leaning figures I simply rebent with warm water.

The paint splotched base figure? Not an issue as no icons are covered, it's just sloppy.

The missing arm figures (both happen to be the same Monster): pathetic crap that shouldn't have escaped quality control and made the box. I'm sending them in for replacement. 

[b]Hopefully Privateer Press will take care of it without issue.[/b] UPDATE: THEY DID SO WITH GRACE.

[b]Now about the game[/b]: I like the rules, I like the dice pool management, I like the theme and the figures. I think it's going to be fun. I also really like the cityscape when set up.

Just got the Battle Box.  Man, this game makes a good first impression.  I don't think I would have liked it as much buying random starters and boosters, but the Battle Box is an outstanding value.  This is the way all of these types of games should be sold. 

Monpoc is the best looking CMG I've seen.  The component quality is 2nd to none.  I'm just learning to play, but it is obvious the the rules have a lot of depth to them that rewards experienced players.

First game was not encouraging. I love the theme and the bits, but wayyyyyy too many rules and symbols (to me, worse than Heroclix). It was almost overwhelming to see how many modifiers you had to take into account before rolling the dice.

This game blows on the Wizkids prepainted minis games out of the water. I demoed this at GenCon a few times, and was blown away by how much fun this was. The sculpts on everything are only surpassed by the paint jobs. Privateer Press definitely had the biggest release at GenCon 08 with this one.  

That being said, I have a problem with "Collectible" games in general. I am an addict at heart, and can't go near any of them with a ten foot pole because I will just drop loads of money on them to have everything I can get my hands on.  I was REALLY tempted to get into this one though.

RATING: 9
I got in as the two player battle boxes came out.  That is the only way to get into this game at a reasonable price.

Really like this one.  Great toy aspect to it, who doesn't like destroying buildings with a large rampaging monster?  The rule set is great.  The only negatives are cost (high but reasonable with the two player battle boxes) and the random buy/collectible aspect.  Highly recommended but be smart as your buying because it can be a money sink.  I'm ignoring the tournament scene, promo figures and megas for that reason. Just too expensive.  For a per-painted miniatures game, you can get it for very reasonable prices now that the game is dead/on hiatus.

Superb miniature game. The theme is awesome. Mega monster battling and destroying a city. The mechanics are very tight and orginal.

Pros:
- the dice pool mecanic, alternating between your monster and army is brilliant. 
- The power dice + Power moves mechanic is fun to use and integral to the success of a game.
- All the armies are really well defined.
- The minis (painted) are very nice!

Cons:
- Collectible. It is not tooexpensive to buy enough stuff to get 2 good armies. But still I would prefer buying a complete army box.
- The icons are really not easy to memorize (I prefere keywords). You really have to print a good player aid (see the one provided by Universal Head).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I dunno.  The art (figures) is nice, and they have done work to give it some depth, but I am not sure I like the business of having stats on the figures as well as having to use as many dice to use a high stat (attack of 8, means using 8 dice) that's both a miniatures-game mechanic, as well as an action-point mechanic and it seems wrong.

Naturally, of course, the whole "buy a lot and keep buying" model a la MTG I can't say I agree with, either.

But it does have monsters..

Aside from being a collectible game (which I generally don't like) I have nothing but fond memories of playing this. Controlling a giant monster and throwing skyscrapers at other monsters? Heck yes! I wish the game were more of that, unfortunately in addition to your monster you also have a small army of small units to micromanage, which can get tedious.

A great kaiju game with great looking maps, buildings, monsters and units. A ton of fun to play. The major complaint against this game was the collectible nature of sealed boosters.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a team is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

Not a bad game . . . wow, is that a glowing recommendation or what?  Actually, the concept and components are nice (I did find it interesting that the stand alone guide showed how to fix pieces, hopefully, that is not a big problem).  IMHO, it is a collectible version of Monsters Menance America (with the relationship between Monsters and Units).  I am generally neutral on collectible concepts in that I usually like the game, but find the collectible nature a minor distraction.  In this instance, it may be a major distraction as you have to buy several different packets to get a good selection of Monsters, Units and Buildings.  With more plays, this may move up in my ratings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fantastic giant-monster-romp of a miniatures game! Small unit miniatures provide tactical choices and strategies, whilst two or more huge-monster minis level sexy looking miniature cities and beat each other to death!

The rules are very easy to learn, but this is countered by exceedingly complex lists of skills. The total result is a very meaty tactical miniatures game with a great theme.

The game feels intense and deep during play, with a simple step wrong costing you the whole game. Despite this the winning position can swing back and forth all game making a highly satisfying and exciting experience.

The rules are pretty tight and there's thankfully very little left open to interpretation. Players looking for a light weight game will be disappointed though- this is a hardcore gamer experience. Light gamers looking for a similar theme should go for Monsters Menace America instead!

Held from a 10 because of two things: money sink doom and due to creators Privateer Press all but abandoning the game and acting like it doesn't exist when asked about it, leaving the second block (series 4-6)  unfinished.

My opinions are drawn from owning everything from series 1-3 and and having played most of series 5-6. I have hoarded a frightening 2 Rise Starter sets, 6 Two Player Battle Boxes, All 6 DMZ Expansions, the comics, every map pack, all three guides, a pile of stuff from online auctions and half the Megas.

Sometimes I look at it and worry I spent too much (£500? probably, no easily...), then I play it again and remember why I so eagerly threw down my money. This game is fantastic.

 Solid game with many options and chocies to make during course of game.  Multiple factions and monsters, each with unique advantages.  Many maps.Well supported with expansions coming out often. Doesn't grow stale as result, even with frequent, long-term play. .Captures feel of genre well. Addictive if you like genre. Fun game even if you don't.   As a cmg, can get  pricey if you lack willpwer and try to get everything. As CMG's go,not superhard to collect..promos being only hard chasers and they are available.  Its a bit steep price wise if you eally start colelcting, but you trading figures can be fun and you do not need everything to play. Well made and well painted figures, Attractive.

I loved Monsterpocalypse, and at one time it was a 10 for me.  But the change in distribution meant that the my favorite factions aren't really being expanded, and because Privateer learned a lot from block 1 to block 2 (read: some balance issues), that was enough for me to retire from this game.  The rules are still great, but it's just not a game I'm going to make an effort to play anymore.

Amazing game. The rating is minus a full 2 points for collectibility, which REALLY holds the game back. Not getting to easily field your desired faction can be very discouraging to new players, and almost got me to give up until I got lucky with a monster booster.

The gameplay itself is easy to learn and very fluid. Monster special abilities are very well thought out -- "good" guys actually have in-game motivation to be good, and "bad" guys have motivation to be evil. Agendas like these add quite a bit to the game.

Privateer is very good about expanding games with accessories, and judging from discussions at GenCon, this will be no exception. Expect to see some very cool additions for this game.

I can't say enough about this game.  It's fantastic!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This may very well be the best CMG ever. 

First of all, there is virtually [i]no rarity[/i], so you can quite easily get the miniatures you really want. Almost all miniatures appear at the same frequency, the only slight variance is in the small units. Also, the monsters are sold in separate boosters, and they always come with their hyperform counterpart in the same box. Any other CMG would have you buying more and more boosters just to find that hyperform to make your monster playable, but here they are playable right out of the box. Also, if you don't need any more monsters, you can just keep getting the unit boosters instead. 

And on top of all that, the distribution in booster cases is so good that when buying a case you will very likely get a complete set: 
- For Series 1, a case of monsters and a case of units got me a complete set.
- For Series  2, a case of monsters and a case of units got me a complete set. 
- For Series 3, a case of unit boosters got me two complete sets of units and installations. 

The sculpts and paintwork are so distinctive and consistent that you can tell at a glance which faction a miniature belongs to, and whether it is a regular or elite unit. This gives a huge boost to usability.

The mechanics are highly thematic, the monster attacks especially so. You can slam the other monsters to the ground, smash buildings on them, use small units as projectiles against other targets, and so on. The monsters gain power by destroying units and get an even higher power boost by leveling buildings. And of course, there is no line of sight, since the monsters are 60 meters tall, so they really couldn't hide anywhere anyway.

Yet another example of the deeply interwoven theme is that the game is really about defeating the other monster. Unlike in most miniature games, you can't win by just destroying the small units. They just go back to the reserves and can be spawned again and again. Why would anyone worry about puny soldiers when there are 50-ton monsters rampaging around ;P

Perhaps the most clever thing is the action point system: The dice are both action points and attack dice, and when you use dice, they are moved from the monster to the minions and vice versa. On your turn, you move either your monster or minions and the number of possible actions depends on how many dice you have available. The more actions you do, the less dice you have for attack rolls. 

The rulebook is surprisingly short and clear, quite the opposite from what you'd expect from a collectible game. It's very easy to start the game but the special powers are where it starts to get messy. Since there are no cards, all the information is on the bases of the miniatures. This means that there are a lot of icons, which creates quite a bit of a learning curve. Of course, keeping track of your special powers is the problem with any CMG, but here the number of different icons seems to be even higher than usually. 

There are some other minor flaws as well:
- The map in the Series 4 starter is the same as in the Series 1 starter.
- There are no set checklists in either booster or starter boxes, and there are no proper set-specific checklists on the official website either.
- There are some packaging flaws, even though they are very rare. I have bought three unit booster cases, 2.5 monster booster cases and two starters, and found only these glitches: One empty booster, one monster came without its hyperform, and about five miniatures were detached from their bases (nothing a drop of cyanoacrylate won't fix in seconds).

Series 1 includes:
- 12 monsters and their hyperforms (2 monsters for each faction)
- 12 grunt units and their elite counterparts (2 unit pairs for each faction)
- 12 one-shot units (2 for each faction)
- 9 buildings

Series 2 includes:
- 12 monsters and their hyperforms (2 monsters for each faction)
- 12 grunt units and their elite counterparts (2 unit pairs for each faction)
- 4 buildings

Series 3 includes:
- 6 hyperform monsters, each with four morpher units (1 monster for each faction)
- 6 grunt units and their elite counterparts (1 unit pair for each faction)
- 6 one-shot grunt units (1 for each faction)
- 6 installations (1 home base for each faction)

Having full sets of the first three Series is quite nice for friendly matches, since the build limits are a maximum of 15 units of which no more than five can be elite, and a maximum of 12 buildings per player.

Series 4 introduces new factions and includes 9 buildings. 

Series 5 includes 8 buildings. [b]Series 5 ruins the perfect case distribution seen in the first 4 series![/b]

The monsters are big, so storage may be an issue; The monster bases are about the same size as the huge ones in Star Wars Miniatures. Map squares are 31 mm. New maps are available in Map Packs and Strategy Guides. Each Map Pack also includes one exclusive building.

Better on the second playing and after reading some kind geeks' strategy hints.  Bumped up 1 point.  Thinking about getting Rise boosters....

Own three Rise starters.  Seems like one simply rushes to power up one's hyper monster form, then engage in a slug fest.  Quite thematic, but it takes a bit of time with lots of symbology overhead.  Game is sure pretty in play, though.

OK, I broke down and bought into these; the minis were just TOO good looking.  I am really interested in having a decent number of Martian and GUARD factions, and more buildings of course.

I have a respectable collection of Martians and Terrasaurs.

This game takes quite a bit to catch on... A lot going on, but the rules themselves are pretty smooth.  Thsi game is designed that in order for your monster to be able to be effective, you need to get a few buildings secured (or destroyed).

The perfect miniatures game in my opinion.  It combines my love of giant monsters smashing things, with ease of play, fun, and most importantly balanced mechanics and factions.  This game plays smoothly, and battles are a blast whether you win or lose.  The figures have all relevant stats listed on their playing piece, and a series of easy-to-remember icons allows you to focus on fun rather than the rulebook.  I really can't say enough good things about this game.  Even the downside of its collectible nature is taken away by online retailers who sell singles at very reasonable prices.  This game is a must-play for any kaiju fan, miniatures fan, or anyone else who likes to have fun.

I think the only thing that holds this game back is PP's somewhat lazy handling of the material. For instance, the abilities became our biggest hinderance with each game. When you find yourself spending most of your time squinting down at a reference sheet before each move, it makes the game drag on forever. Fortunately we were able to find some custom made sheets and things have moved much more smoothly.

3 games played. 3 games won. So maybe I'm biased.

But it looks great, the dice pool system works well, the six factions all have a flavour and the rules don't force you to play with just one faction which makes the collectable nature less of a pain than some other CMGs.

Only want the building for use with other games.  Could care less about this game in general.  Though I am a big "monster" fan (monsters across America anyone :D )  I can't stand collectible games anymore.  Too many have I've gotten into and the endless trying to get all the pieces to play is tedious not to mention pricey.  I'd rather see a base "set" and expansion with NON collectible figures.

Only thing I can hope is that this game does so poorly that it'll get canceled and I'll can then pick it up on the cheap like I did with hecatomb.

Finally broke down and bought two starters, one for me and one for the boy.  Not bad.  The game itself is fun, loaded with cool abilities, and is slickly produced.  Cost...oh boy, the cost...absolutely nuts.  Sure, you're getting what you pay for, but it is hard to pay for what you get.  And if you like one specific "team" of monsters (I really wanted the Cthul guys, but got GUARD in my starter...my monster is cool, but it isn't what I wanted), it's going to cost you even more.  Gonna pick up a few unit boosters and then maybe one more shot at a monster booster.  We'll see.  If the expansions require you to buy a new starter every time, I don't see this one hanging around.  Shame about the collectable aspect...can't see any reason why they couldn't have just sold them by set (aside from making more cash on suckers like me).  

Edit: Got a different monster booster just to get away from robots...and I got Power Rangers, the other set of robots.  

2nd Edit:  After my 3rd duplicate of the same robot, I'm done with this game.  Dropped my score considerably.  I wish PP well with this one, but I've spent my last dime on Monsterpocalypse.

Monster mayhem that I enjoy quite a bit. Easy to get the miniatures you want from the internet, so "Collectible" doesn't bother too much. Deep thinking with good looking city destruction. Too much for casual gamer though, and mostly meant for 2 player games only, so hard one to put on the table, if no dedicated players are around. Learning tricks and reading about opponent's abilities help a lot, so good game for anyone who enjoys reading a lot about the game while waiting for next gaming night.

RATING: 5.5
I LOVE the theme, so I had to put my hands on this game. 
My rating is after one (incomplete) play. The game is good and more complex than at first glance: after a few turns the rules go smooth, but the most difficult and interesting part is to learn how to use at best the strange special abilities of your monsters.  
After the starter set, the collectible element (which generally I despise) is easily overcome thanks to eBay ;-)
BUT the collectable factor has another serious negative effect: I would have liked complete focus on the monsters battle, but you can't play only the Stomping Giant Monsters or the heroic human defenders, as every player is forced by the rules to split his attention and actions between one Mega-Monster and a few less interesting and effective support troops. This IMO is seriously anti-climactic.  :-(

I want to say this game is brilliant.  But the learning curve makes it unlikely I would ever play it if I bought in to it.  Privateer Press seems to be grooming this for official play.

I've been burned on collectible games in the past, but the theme and game design have me hooked.  The dice pool system is really nice.  I like being able to control the odds by deciding how many dice to use in an attack.  The special abilities of monsters, units, and buildings add lots of fun and fit the theme.  The martians abduct enemies into the mothership, the Cthul sacrifice their own units for health, etc.

It's very expensive, and I'm not sure you get what you pay for (£8-10 for 5, 1 cm, models).

Ninety minutes of metropolis-whomping awesome! Kudos to PP - this is one of my favorite miniatures games.

[b]Several BGG'ers have compained about the price and complexity of Monsterpocalypse. I'm going to address that right here:[/b]

First of all, many people are drawn to Monsterpocalypse for the 'big monsters dukin' it out' theme and come into the game expecting a beer'n'pretzels throw-down. While the mechanics portray theme every bit as well as you'd hope, the game is a hell of a lot deeper than you'd expect. 

A lot of the complexity arises from the monsters, the units, and the buildings each having their own unique set of abilities. Probably the most common complaint I hear from first-timers is 'Holy shit! Too many little icons! I have no idea what does what!'. This is mitigated by unit/building/monster-specific reference cards (available for free in the MonPoc Files section), but yeah, there's a bit of rules overhead. Trust me, it's worth it.

I agree that the collectible release model was a bad idea and it turned a lot of people off of the game immediately. 

Monsterpocalypse's most obvious draw is the kaiju-wrasslin' theme. This is well-executed in both look and feel: 

1) The miniatures look awesome - I'd go so far as to say that the Planet Eaters and Terrasaurs are some of the best pre-painted models I've ever seen - and a unified force adds to the game's already striking visuals.

2) Apart from Dune, I haven't seen another game whose mechanics are so deftly knit with its subject matter. Here we have monsters that come in normal, foundation-shaking Alpha forms which can be powered up into their corresponding superduper badass Hyper forms, their distinct unit detachments, and a variety of different buildings with which to construct your metropolis, all with a bevy of unique skills and abilities that give each faction its own 'feel'. There are rules for how to build a city (your map), for colliding with buildings and hazards such as roaring flames and nuclear waste, and for gaining 'power dice' by destroying your opponent's units and leveling the city's infrastructure (and occasionally by securing buildings and other areas of key tactical importance) which you then spend for your monster to perform WWF-style 'power attacks' like body-slamming another monster into the flaming foundation of a skyscraper, head-butts, throwing your opponent halfway across the map, swatting flying units out of the sky and into ground-pounding targets, or simply rampaging through everything in your path, leaving a wake of wreckage and upturned asphalt. There are specialty dice with explosions on them. It is awesome.

Now, the type of folks who would gravitate towards a game like this for the theme (which is most people, I think) are going to want to run faction-pure forces because it looks cooler when everything matches. Anybody attracted by Privateer Press' reputation for producing tactically complex titles will also want to go faction-pure, since those lists perform better under most circumstances (as units' abilities within a faction are designed to complement one another and it's cheaper to bring in-faction units into play than it is out-of-faction units.) So what did Privateer Press do? They made it all but fucking impossible to put together a faction-specific force because you had to buy everything in blind boosters.

(To their credit, however, the case distribution is awesome. If you buy a case of Monster boosters, you are guaranteed to get one of each monster in the Series, no repeats. If you buy a unit case, you are guaranteed to get at least one of each unit in the Series.)

That said, it wasn't long before the online singles market started to pick up momentum. Unit and monster singles were crazy expensive at first, but the prices had dropped dramatically by the release of Series 3, and with the release of Series 4 - which introduced six new factions - the prices of Series 1-3 models dropped even more. I ran some numbers of Monsterpocalypse singles about a month ago to compare the prices for Rise (Series 1) figures to Now (Series 4) figures. The "monster price" is the average price of all the monsters in the Series. The "faction price" takes a cue from TeamCovenant's ‘Monsterpocalypse Now’ Faction Packs, which offer a fully playable force in the form of one of each rare, two of each uncommon, and three of each common unit in a faction of your choosing. The value listed is the average price for a so-called "Faction Pack" in that Series. (All prices from the same online retailer.)

[b]Avg. Now monster price[/b]: $10.15

[b]Avg. Now faction price[/b]: $31.36

The Savage Swarm just edges out Ubercorp as the cheapest faction for units. Unurprisingly, Empire of the Apes is the most expensive.

[b]Avg. Rise monster price[/b]: $7.32

[b]Avg. Rise faction price[/b]: $17.05 

That Rise faction price is also overstated since it includes the single most expensive unit in the game, the Lords of Cthul's "Meat Slave", which at $12.99 costs more than any of the monsters. If you're playing any Rise faction other than Lords of Cthul, the average faction price is $15.87.

Incidentally, the Rise buildings average $3.17 each as compared to $4.65 for Now buildings.

Buying singles online is also only one way to get into Monsterpocalypse. TeamCovenant, as I mentioned, is rocking a sweet deal where you can purchase a Series 4 starter for twenty bucks (five dollars less than retail) and for five dollars extra, they’ll replace the monster in the starter with whatever monster you want. On top of that, they’re selling "faction packs" for each force which, for between $30 and $40, will net you a completely kitted-out, faction-pure force. (For the record, it’s one of each rare unit, one more random rare, two of each uncommon unit, and three of each common unit to total thirteen units plus an extra building. And no, the most competitive armies aren’t all rares. Rare units serve a niche / utility role and barring two specific cases you won’t ever need more than one or two them.) For about $50, that nets you a monster of your choosing, thirteen units, three buildings, dice, a health tracker, and a map. Two of those and you're set to go - there's really no reason to buy random boosters anymore.

Additionally, some random geek’s recent Toy Fair photos reveal that Privateer Press will soon be offering their own two-player starter box (“A complete game for two players including two full forces!”, the box says.) If this is anything like the two-player bundle they offered at Christmas, it’ll run about $50 and include two starters and four unit boosters-worth of stuff, which nets you two monsters, twenty-four units, six buildings, two health trackers, two sets of dice, and maps. The monster and unit selection will probably be random, of course, but it's also half the price of going the TeamCovenant faction pack route. I can attest that playing with a motley assortment of units is every bit as fun, so I wouldn't worry about that too much.

(2-player Battle Boxes only) 

Monsterpocalypse is amazingly beautiful and very thematic, but also has a lot of depth and complexity that is usually missing from this kind of game. This is an action-heavy, monster-on-monster bash, where you can ram, throw or body slam your opponent through an exploding cityscape. Behind this awesome action though, is a very sublte resource management system where you manage your power dice and position your units carefully to build your power base and interfere with your opponent. One of the best. 

Thank you Privateer Press, for ditching the collectible format.

I really enjoy the gameplay, and like the figures. The random packaging is a major problem; you just don't get the figures you actually need to play (and the price is way too high compared to other CMGs). Also a problem is the poor choice of putting lots of tiny icons on the bases; very hard to keep track of what they do.

I had a lot of fun with this game while I played it.  With this game, Privateer Press found a way to do CMG's right!

Got two of the 2-player starter sets ending up with 4 different factions which is good enough for me to play non-competitively.  Also got one of the original starters and an extra map pack expansion for some added  variety. Okay, and then later a few D.M.Z. sets to make up for the factions I didn't get in the starter or 2-player sets.  And then some singles.  Oh yeah, had to get the strategy guides too which led me to a case of monsters and units from ICNY and the morphers and bases from AYB.  So in that far I decided on the Mega Pack to have at least one mega for each faction. Hey, FRP sells Litko markers for the terrain and there's accessory packs to attach to the bottom of your stuff that come with more dice.  Cool. AHHHHHHRRrrrrrr, I'm hooked on plastic crack again!!!!  Promise to self, no factions beyond AYB.  Oh, and no Voltron either.  That stuff is just silly.  Monpoc=Awesome mini game.

Really fun mini game. The dice as resource management is a nice touch and the figs (units, monsters, and buildings) all look awesome. each Faction has different styles of play, and being able to "correct"  crappy dice odds by adding in better dice is a great touch. I would suggest picking up a starter and some boosters, it is a blast!

Appreciate the main idea and the really cool minias. Game play is quite hard to enter for children, maybe too easy for gamers. Good and funny game.

First impression wasn't all that good.
Paper maps, collectible and the theme that didn't get me all that excited. But after playing a couple of times, I really like it. I still don't like collectible nature, but the game itself is great fun!

Easily the best CMG out there, good painted minis, easy start rules with lots of depth to add, great for all ages. Nothing better than wake up a sunday and set up a game with the kids. I highly recommend this game, is expensive, but there are some stores that sell the singles, so you can build your army without the random factor.
Other feature that i like a lot is the big selection of maps (maps play a huge rol in the game, so as structures) 
So, choose your monster, add some units and try it, you wont regret it.

Seems like it is going to be an interesting game.  I can't wait to try it more this Summer.

EDIT: Only one face to face play so far but I can't wait to play this more often.  If I can get people to commit to learning and playing it this could be my game of the summer.

EDIT:  I've played this quite a bit now and plan to keep playing it.

Was dubious at first, but this game's getting to me, truly... and even the GF kinda like the little saurus !

Only hope it won't suffer the same fate as Dreamblade (In france at least the support seems to be growing quicker than for the previous... And if you add more fluff, comics, strong "factionality"... yes, there IS hope :) )

Preliminary 6. There is a lot to learn and know as you play this game and the iconography is a bit of a challenge as well. The monster/unit/building sculpts all look great although the paper map and cheapy hazard tiles are kind of a bummer. It didn't really click for me until we had been going at it for a good hour and change but after that I enjoyed the game. That said, there is a steep learning curve and a lot of time and money to be invested into this game. I stand by my statement that you really need a dedicated group for this to get the most out of it; it's far too complex and consuming to play sporadically.

On paper, it seems great and the figures are excellent.

Traded for PNP Merchant of Venus.

[b]INCREDIBLE, 18,000-TONNE TANK-EATING, SKYSCRAPER-SMASHING, NUCLEAR POWER PLANT-DESTROYING, MONSTER OF A MINIATURES GAME![/b]

For a CMG, this is a lot less random in its spread of models found in boosters than you'd expect - I should know: I've opened maybe a hundred boosters for trade.

Also, you do not need half as many models to have a superb game as you do in other miniature systems, especially collectable ones; even less so if you are not bothered about faction loyalty.

Figure quality is as good as anything WoTC has churned out. Though, IMO, does not supercede them, especially D&D's Legendary Evils range.

[b]THE GODZILLA:[/b]

1. Amazing Godzilla-inspired theme.
2. Cool monster miniatures.
3. Great sculpts and paints jobs on ALL the models.
4. Nice distribution in the boosters.
5. You don't need to keep up with the newest set to have a good time.
6. Doesn't seem to have suffered from the dreaded "power creep" disease that tends to rot these games. Yet...
7. You get to throw your opponent's 150-foot-high mega robot through a downtown apartment complex, showering the area in shattered masonry (in my mind).
8. Your megabeast can headbut hotels and giant, tentacled monstrosities with wild abandon.
9. Game gives you the chance to pitch Godzilla Vs. King Kong! Come on, it doesn't get much better than that on a dining room table.
10. Greatest dice management system ever developed. Wow, what a geek thing to write.
11. Not only does the game have gigantic monsters, it also fields tanks, helicopters and other cool shit.
12. Has the special power to draw in non-hobbyists.
13. More tactical depth than immediately apparent.
14. Smarter game than any super-huge monster mash game has any damn right.
15. Can evoke wonderful after-game post-mortems: "What about when I kicked your giant space alien into the bank headquarters? That must have left a scar!"
16. This is a sound-effects game. If you're not making roaring noises, smashing and crashing booms, or growls, you are not playing it right.
17. Unlike Chess, this is fun even when you're losing!

[b]THE GODZOOKIE:[/b]

1. It's collectable.
2. Weighter rules than you might expect.
3. Icon happy. There are many, many obscure symbols on the bases of these models, forcing you to look each one up frequently - especially if you have the memory of a forgetful gnat, just like me.
4. Maps are printed on paper - needing sheet perspex or some similar transparent material to weigh it down, unless you want Zor-Raiden to fall foul of a paper fold. Which is a teeny bit indignant if you weigh in at 6,500 tonnes of shining titaniumex.
5. For the game to truly glow you need quite a few buildings. This should be [i]NO SURPRISE WHATSOEVER[/i] to true miniatures players, as all games of this type are only as good as the terrain you have access to.
6. Needs the cashflow of a hedge fund manager to buy into EVERY faction. Though, this is unnecessary, especially if you have interested friends.
7. Frequent expansions.
8. Needs a pirate's treasure chest to cart around all the gear to a games night at Jonathan's.

Collectible miniatures games are not my cup of tea. The number of different powers and symbols in this one is both a curse and a blessing. Impossible to remember them all, but at least it really makes the units unique.

The dice moving mechanic is quite good but games are a little longer than they should be unless you invest in buildings and extra miniatures.

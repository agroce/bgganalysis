Game is just an amazing amount of fun!  After demoing it at Kublacon I had to buy it.  If you like the golden age of slasher films (jason, freddy, etc.) and your looking for a game that captures it, drive out to Camp Grizzly for a great summer vacation :-)

It's been a while since horror fans have had a game to champion that wasn't Cthulhu or zombies.  Camp Grizzly is a strong contender for best horror themed board game of all time.  If you're a fan of the movies that inspired this game you're going to find quite a bit to like.  The game isn't very complex, but it provides fun and exciting sessions.  Ameritrash Games has a winner with this game.

In a lot of ways this is kind of awful. A board game seemingly designed by non-gamers, where players have almost no control over the game and everything is incredibly luck dependent, plus the rulebook is garbage. I got this for the theme and the artwork, and it's worth keeping for that aspect alone, plus I'm hoping that this a coop that can go over pretty well with the right non-gamer crowd. Think Betrayal at the House on the Hill, but even more random and unfortunately without as much fluff variety. This could really use all the promised expansions (which might apparently be released one day?).

A really fun "beer and pretzels" co-op with stunning art and tons of theme. +1 for fans of 80s slasher films, who will feel right at home in Camp Grizzly, smiling even as their hapless Counselors are picked off one by one.

RATING: 8
Yes, this game is random, but this game sets a great atmosphere and does not feel as utterly unfair as A Touch Of Evil: e.g. if the 'tracker of evil' reaches the end, this does not lead to an instant and anticlimactic loss, but to a desperate showdown.

The win conditions are rather random at times and all teamwork can be tossed overboard sometimes, with unpredictable results. As such, every game can end with great laughs at unexpected outcomes.

The number of characters largely determines the difficulty: the more there are, the easier the game becomes. Due to player elimination issues, I would recommend playing with 2 characters for each player in a 2-player game or starting a new counselor after a player death if there are more players.

Replayability is OK, but it would be nice to get extra content - cards, set-ups, finales, even a game board. The expansion seems to be in the making, but has been for years now...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
As someone who tends to prefer execution of theme over Eurogame abstraction, this game was a joy to play with the right group. If you are looking for a strategy game, this is not it. However, Camp Grizzly succeeds as a "story generator" sort of game in that you will live and die by your dice rolls and the cards you draw. Brutal events can quickly turn an obvious victory into a huge challenge, and vice versa. Great to play around Halloween.

RATING: 1
Kinda weak for a $50 game.  Needs to have a lot more scenarios, bigger board, etc. to justify the price.  I would avoid until the price comes down.  It is a cute game and very quick and kinda fun.  Box says 1 - 2 hours but I haven't had a game yet last more than 15 minutes.  Also needs a bit more balance - Otis has won every time.  Easily.

RATING: 5
It's stupid balls-to-the-wall ameritrash, but something feels like it's missing. The decisions are too thin, but the story element isn't as strong (or even silly) like Betrayal on the House on the Hill. It's not utterly horrible, but I'm not sure I'm convinced.

To be fully honest, I had a pretty good time playing this game, even though it's generally not the style I like (all theme, luck, and no real gameplay).  My inclination is to give the credit there to the people I played with, who got into their characters correctly.  Also, there was a large dash of luck that turned what was looking like an easy win into a tight exciting finish.  I wouldn't seek this game out to play, but if someone put it in front of me I'd probably be up for it at least once more.

This game is oozing with theme and although the randomness can be frustrating to some players, it adds to the unpredictability factor of the horror genre. This game has so much potential with the upcoming expansions to fix some of its flaws. Will wait for them before updating my score.

RATING: 9
I was 13 when the first Friday the 13th came out and it was some scary stuff to me back then. I saw a few more of the movies before the franchise became overly ridiculous -- or I grew up, whichever, but my point is that I love this theme. And this game nails it. It reminds me of Last Night on Earth the way you feel like you're playing out a movie. The situations are classic and often quite humorous. 

The game offers a great opportunity for a lot of laughs and quasi-roleplaying (if you want) but it also offers some nice decisions. You have to carefully plot out where your counselors should move so as to attract Otis in the least harmful way, and you use your items and action cards in concert with one another. I've played multiplayer and solitaire and enjoy both. 

Like any thematic game, it will eventually need more characters and cards and those are on the way in the form of expansions. I can see myself chasing expansions here.

Note: Solitaire scenario from the KS campaign:

This is a good cooperative board game with a thick theme that originated on Kickstarter. The rules are a bit vague in some spots, but it can be worked out. Has good replay value & nice artwork. Dial in the slasher film music channel, light up the oil lantern!

RATING: 7.5
Amazing co-op survival game that pays beautiful homage to the 80s summer camp Slasher movies. Sadly overshadowed by Last Friday, this one takes the killer and outs him in a pretty decent AI rather than split your group in a 1 vs many situation. The gameplay is a little light, but the tropes and the amazing artwork and scenarios perfectly fit the theme and definitely make up for it's flaws.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Awesome game. Great fun, plays on the old '70s and '80s horror vibe but with a dark sense of humour. Engaging for two players (we usually play with two PCs each, plus Otis) and quite interesting with 4-7 (six PCs, and a seventh player can play Otis and other NPCs, and track environment effects etc). Still waiting on the long-promised expansions but hopefully "any day now"!

Unfair, Ameritrash game dice chucker. Soooo fun. Game is based at a summer camp like Camp Crystal Lake from the Friday the 13th series but is renamed for obvious reasons (please don't sue). Dripping in theme it uses a search piles of random stuff to get what you need to trigger then finale but it is soooo dripping in humor and theme it really adds to the enjoyment of playing the game. I would say if you just looked at the raw mechanics of this game it's a 6 but with the other elements it gives it a full +2 to the rating. Just don't play with "that guy" who doesn't read the flavor text and pulls the curtain away from the Wizard of Oz.

RATING: 7.3
Game is quick and dirty (about an hour) and is very evocative of the theme it's going for. I can't help but compare this Betrayal, and mechanically, Betrayal is actually the more interesting experience, but as a genre game, this blows it out of the water. Yes, you're fighting the same dude over and over, but he's so much more charismatic than most board game baddies that this really feels like a privilege. Except for the times when it's not... you see, like betrayal this game is full of randomness with card draws and dice rolls, and sometimes, Otis, the ai driven slasher, just never becomes much of a threat. In fact, usually, the counselors are their own worst enemies, drawing cards that hamper their progress, such as the ever looming "fooling around" cards that force player characters to commit that most pernicious of horror film transgressions (lookin at you Kevin/"life guard"/sex fiend). But since each card drawn is well illustrated and breaths life and detail into the world and the narrative, none of the hiccups and set-backs ever feel unfair. This game is just fun. It's not much of a thinker. It is the perfect mindless, campy horror flick distilled into a much more charming experience. Played it three times in one night and started seeing some repeated content, but also there was some fresh stuff too. I will say, component quality is not at's best, and cards will start to show wear right away. The way the game naturally encourages cooperating players to throw each other under the bus, and the potential for random mayhem really keep the game tense even as things are going well. Unfortunately, I've won every game I've played so far which is not what I really like to see out of a coop game, and I will probably be altering some rules to make the game harder. It would have been nice if the game came with it's own "hard" variant, or a double sided board that created more difficult situations. Additionally, while the game is short, downtime can become a bit of a problem at five and six players, but you'll want to get a variety of people playing at once for the flavor, so that's a double edged sword (I suggest 4, I suppose). Finally, in my last two plays (both with 6 people) we had a couple AP prone guys who really started to set some of us off because often times there's really only 1 or 2 reasonable things to do on your turn and so it really should not drag this way, but being confronted with limited (often all bad) options can really stump/frustrate some people. It's one of the things I like about the game. Scratches a very different itch than say, Pandemic as you're trying not to die in the next two turns, not planning seven rounds ahead and optimizing your turn accordingly. I really can't wait to get a hold of the expansions as I can only imagine they will elevate the game immeasurably. Very glad I got this game to play for when their's not enough time to play Eldritch (there rarely is). Also, this game manages to consistently build a coherent story, whereas Eldritch is very hit or miss in that regard. Would suggest to fans of slasher flicks, and light move and roll/draw adventure games.

Another word about Grizzly after even more plays:
Firstly, I have written more about this game than any other, and that should speak to how much I enjoy it. Secondly, I have had managed to get a lot of different people to the board with this game, which is also a testament to its quality and accessibility. The point of this update is to state that who you play with matters immensely. People who love horror and dig the theme, make the game a blast. People who will read out their cabin cards enthusiastically show the picture and imaginatively expand on the situation elevate the game immeasurably. The inverse is also true. I think from now on, I will be keeping an eye out for people who I'd like to play this game with, and people with whom it would fall flat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme and artwork are wonderful. They do a great job of really making you feel like you are in an 80's slasher flick. The cabin cards weave a great narrative....sometimes. That is the problem, the game is wildly inconsistent. One game we are barely hanging on, limp in to the final and only a few of us make it out in epic fashion. The next time we can't get any weapons, one of the objectives we need isn't on the board, Otis strikes every chance he gets, and so on. Despite these flaws it plays quick, is easy to teach, and we generally get a lot of laughs. I like to break it out with a group of at least 4 though mechanically it plays well at any count. Will definitely keep in the collection.

The artwork is really nice and humorous.
The last couple weeks have been a horror board game buying deluge: Camp Grizzly, Psycho Raiders, and Mysterium.

Played one solitaire game last night manning two counselors. I do understand the rating comments that the game plays itself, but do find it fun how Otis just.keeps.coming. and the counselors scramble about the board attempting to survive and reach a Finale.

The rulebook is small, general, and as beautiful as the rest of the game. There were many questions regarding mechanics, timing, playing cards, but lots of good rules questions-based threads here on BGG to clear up gray areas.

I paid a lot of money for the game and shipping and am a bit bummed at the thinness of the cards and components. I plan to sleeve the cards and look for something to protect other card components.

Love the theme.  It's a shame that there's not a lot of play.

Draw some cards and roll some dice until the game tells you that you're dead or you survived.  You can't make an informed choice about anything, so the game lacks any real sense of tension.

The components are low quality for the price.

I'm loving this game right now because it's theme is so perfectly handled in this game. The art work is fun and the game is light... perhaps too light (one of my hard core gaming friends after his first play with us winning the game sort of shrugged his shoulders and said the game was 'cute'). It comes down to a very simple move & draw a card mechanic. Right now I'm really liking it. The test will be to see how well it holds up over time

Funny and clever writing, but the game play is pretty weak. Pretty much completely random and no strategy with almost everything relying on dice rolls or random card draws.

Probably a good game to play over a few beers.

Camp Grizzly is a semi-cooperative survival horror board game for 1-6 players.

The year is 1979, players take the roles of Camp Counselors who are being stalked through a maze of cabins and camp trails by 'Otis', a homicidal killer with an unhealthy bear fetish.

Working together, the Counselors explore the camp grounds while searching for a combination of objectives that can trigger one of four different game endings. Those who survive the finale win the game!

It won't be easy. After every round of player turns, the NPC killer, Otis, stalks the closest targets around the board, attacking whenever he gets the chance. Unarmed players PANIC, are injured and forced to run away. Those lucky enough to have found protection are able to fight Otis with a dice roll. Better weapons mean higher value dice and a greater chance of success. Beat Otis and he disappears form the board until re-emerging from the woods on his next turn.

Camp Grizzly is a strange bird. On one hand it is extremely thematic. Every time I play the game I feel like I am in the middle of the same slasher movie being chased by the maniacal, but silent, murderer. At the same time though the mechanics are like something out of the past (although at times that can be a good thing). I have enjoyed the plays I have had of the game, but they all did have somewhat of a samey feel to them, even though the endings were all completely different. I enjoy the random ending generation and that is one the best mechanics this game brings to the table, but there is a limit to how many generations of those endings there are (6 in the base game). I wish the designer could have streamlined the design to get rid of the part of the game where the players choose which and when the finale begins. Overall though the game is definitely one of the better KS from new designers/publishers to come out in the past couple of years and I think I will be able to get a few more fun plays out of it.

Played late at night at a bar at a con and this game was good for some laughs at how the events unfolded. Problem is the game basically plays itself and the players are largely along for the random ride.  In its defense, it never claims or pretends to be a game of deep strategy but there are other highly thematic games out there where you feel that your decisions are more meaningful.

What makes this one of my favorite new games is the rich theme and how much everyone in my gaming group gets into that theme. They aren't roleplayers but man do they just naturally start roleplaying in this game! In Camp Grizzly you play as camp counselors trying to escape from a serial kill in classic 80's horror movie style.

The game mechanics themselves are nothing to write home about but how they capture the theme is! I love how it seems like you can easily get away from the slow moving killer and then he suddenly appears right in front of you. There is also a great push your luck mechanic called [u]fooling around[/u] (which usually relates to making out or skinny dipping) which almost guarantees your get attacked. The game perfectly captures all our favorite horror movie moments and lets us still be in control of our fate.

Gameplay: exploration, card play, teamwork, some backstabbing, roleplaying

One of my most favorite game ever. Shame that they've dropped this product.
It have simple gameplay but can still deliver the thrill while playing. 
Good game good survival concept. You can either run away and let your friends die fighting or you can fight and ... die with 'em :)

Loved this game, straight up old school slasher homage. The art is great story is fun and game play has a great old style feel to it. Only Knock is the component quality could be better, but for a small company's first go round I give it two thumbs up.

I love this game, play it constantly with my friends. I even got my own miniatures and painted them! Also have played the expansions at Kublacon, they make the game even better, however they are taking a long time to release them. Know its worth the wait though!

Amazing art, but I wish the cards were larger to show them off. The game is fun, especially the multiple endings. Maybe subsequent plays will rate this higher.

Awesome art.  Great sense of dark humor.  This is a slasher film in a box.  That said, this is the epitome of a YMMV kind of game.  It is best played with a group of friends who are going to laugh along with the game.  This game works best as a MST3K type experience where players are willing to joke along with the game.  It is not a serious euro game and is best suited for players looking to share in a great slasher flick style story.

RATING: 3
A Kickstarter game that's--surprise!--underdeveloped. Roll-and-move thematic games aren't my thing, but I rated Last Night on Earth a 5, which is a similar type of game, so my 4 for Camp Grizzly might be viewed in that context. The problem with the game is that players don't make many decisions, and the end is weirdly anticlimactic, though it tries very hard not to be. I don't think I did much to determine how the game played out. The dice went quite badly against us, so we lost as a group. One player who wasn't eliminated elected not to continue. If it had gone on longer than the 15-20 minutes it took to play, my rating would be lower.

A tough, but fun semi-cooperative game which a very strong theme.  I got this game because there is currently nothing else like it out there (that I know of).  I especially like how the gruesome artwork is juxtaposed by the cartoony, but very cool artwok by one of the Pixar animators.

RATING: 2
Played multi-player. There was almost nothing to do on an individual turn. The entire game seemed to be dictated by random events. The end-game win mechanic is at least as bad as the random carrot draw at the end of Killer Bunnies. I wasn't just bored, I was actively wishing to be doing pretty much anything else. Whatever it is other people see in this game, I didn't get it at all.

Far too random for my taste.  The very definition of Ameritrash which is not meant as an criticism.  Enjoyable if you are into that kind of thing.  Theme is definitely there.

Very fun slasher-flick game, especially when most of us die.

Absolutely the best (non-lovecraftian) horror game ever made.  No dumb zombies, just a killer with a bear fetish.  This was the most fun I've had playing a board game in a long time.  
Truly a great game.  As expansions come out, this will only get more and more plays.  
If you're a horror fan and didn't kickstart this, you should be kicking yourself.  
This should be the game all horror games strive to be moving forward.

The theme, art and feel of the game really do it for me as a fan of classic slasher movies and board games. It's rules light and tense, very good for a party game with even casual gamers.

Super fun game, especially for anyone who's a fan of 80s horror movies.  Super cool artwork, really easy to play and understand.  Fun and easy mechanisms while very deep in the theme of a masked serial murderer who has an uncanny ability to pop out of nowhere and kill you.  Can't wait to play again.

A fantastic game. Play for the story/atmopsphere/experience, and forget about strategy and winning for a bit. Get sucked into the incredible art and you'll start to feel like you're there with Otis in place of your counselor. 

Those who hate lady luck better stay away, as her wild mood swings will likely just cause anger. The same goes for those who take delight in beating down dear friends with their supreme intellect.

Players are camp counselors at a camp ground set in a 70's slasher movie.  It's a semi-cooperative game in that surviving players win regardless of who lives and who dies.  But, not surprisingly, players need to cooperate to survive the game finale.  Otis can be potent or impotent depending on cards and die rolls.  Prepare for a wild ride.  The art is fantastic American comic style.  I hope the expansions are eventually released to keep the game fresh.

Can't help but compare to [thing=165748][/thing].  Both are set in the late 70's and inspired by slasher films of that time, but that is about all they have in common.  Both games are gruesome, but Camp Grizzly does it in a comic horror style with a spalsh of sex.  Choices and outcome in Camp Grizzly are determined far more by the game than the sandbox world of Psycho Raiders.  But sometimes it is fun to have fate drive the story while the characters hang on for the ride, and the lack of control does suit the theme in much the same vein as in [thing=145308][/thing] or [thing=39941][/thing].  Both Camp Grizzly and Psycho Raiders deliver the goods, but the goods are apples and oranges.

Kickstarted with all expansions! Looks amazing, this one deserves to be backed!

Update: finally got my first (solo) play in. Just as good as anticipated thankfully! Looking forward to introducing to friends - I'm sure Camp Grizzly is going to be a hit!

It's a good game with a great theme. I really love the 80s slasher movie feel of the game. The camp setting is amazing. I got the Beta version and now the full game too, but I'm still missing some finales that should come sometime in the future. I like the possibilites of different endings, so that you never know what waits for you at the end of the game. It really helps the suspension. I think with only the standard endings the game could get boring but there's so much more to come and I really am excited to try that out. 

Kickstarted.

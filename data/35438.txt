The box contents are lavish, the model bikes that wheelie and lean sublime. The track is very well made and the bits generally quality and glossy.

Shame the game is no more than a childish roll and move parade with notional rules to pep things up but in reality offer no more that bloody obvious options over what to do with the dice.

Over produced crap. Avoid at all cost.

Played only 1 time with basic rules, too many fortune with dice, but i need to reconsider the game with the full rules. Good component, i write full review at the next game.
Ok played with all rules, a good game, too many fortune, but a little strategy with counting the right position to have more advantage in subsequential turn. For me a good game, playable with gamers and newbie

I really enjoyed this game.  I believe the Stand and Expert rules are the only rules a player should use, as these are clearly the best.

I like the restrictions imposed by the corners, and the ensuing choices a player needs to make about accelerating, braking, using engine points and using tire points as the race proceeds.  The variability in the system due to the expert rules (slopes), and varied set-up make for an interesting game that is not just fun to play, but gorgeous to look at as well.

This game is best with the full compliment of players.

Update:  I think it would be nice if the game included some reward for hugging the racing line. The lack of difference between lanes is less interesting than it could be.

Against the comments of first time players like Mr. Candyland, I bought this game and have played 6 games now. Each game gets even better, especially now that you can see the track subtleties and know when to accelerate and when to slow down.  The endings of three games have not come down to lucky die rolls, but rather who is in a good position to make the right move.  I watched one player move from 3rd to 1st because he had 5 engine points left and used them in the last 2 turns to take the lead.

Wish I had more bikes, I think it will be even more exciting with 12 or 18 bikes.

RATING: 6
I find this more even than formula D because its harder to get a runaway leader. YOu can flip your dice to move faster or slower if you time your movement in the curves right. Wheelies add a nice visual to the game and hills change it up a bit as well

Beautiful components, and absolutely tepid game design.  Racing - even with the "advanced" rules - is little more than getting lucky with the dice.  Cornering has been reduced to a blase affair of simply hoping you can land on the right spots.  The entire design makes Formula De look challenging and deep (which is far from the truth).

A gorgeous production desperately seeking a system to suit them.

Like a watered-down, neutered version of Das MotorSportSpiel.  Decisions are fairly minimal, even using the expert rules.  The articulated bikes that lean and wheelie are really cool until one discovers that no player input is involved -- the rules tell you when to adjust the piece.  I guess I'd give it another try just to be sure, but my initial reaction to gameplay is disappointment.

RATING: 6
Players race motorcycles around various circuits.  Beautiful looking race game featuring template track pieces, and lovely motorcycle models (which actually pivot on their stands to simulate wheelies and leaning).  The movement mechanic is roll two dice, which the option to flip them over to their reverse sides to simulate acceleration or braking (seen in other race games, but better implemented here).  The designers seem to understand you brake before corners and accelerate through them, so the game encourages you to not get stuck on turns (where the dice flipping is more restricted).  Three levels of difficultly, but even the expert rules are easily handled.  Tons of tracks to build.  Issues?  The ball/socket mechanism in the motorcycle stands are a bit loose, and require a blob blu-tac putty to keep them stable, and just be aware most of these tracks are very large and require a large area to set them up.  Sits nicely along with Motorchamp and Leader 1 as one of the better race games in the collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Two plays. Just beginning to explore the game. Visually appealling. I know a lot about GP racing and so far it appears the designers have captured, in abstract, the overall concept in board game form.

The other two players know little or nothing about motorcycles yet it was them who demanded we play again the moment the first race ended.

Having played this now, I really like it.  It feels like MGP racing, particularly since there always seems to be one racer running away from the pack while everyone else battles for 2nd and 3rd.  The reason I did not rate it a 9 is because a couple of rules are unclear and/or poorly written, particularly the "loosing grip/wheelie" rule that docs the next turn's movement.

I haven't played the expert rules yet, so take the following with a grain of salt.

Even the standard rules for Moto Grand Prix are really simple (although somewhat counterintuitive in some cases) which allows for a fairly quick race even though a standard race calls for 6 laps. Over that distance the luck of the dice should have a chance to even out a little.

What makes it a little too simplistic, however, is that you can make good use of almost any dice roll, and it is typically very obvious what a good move looks like, and there is no penalty at all for flying through a difficult corner at top speed.

It does look very pretty, though.

RATING: 10
Simple rules that in combination with the very cleverly designed track layouts makes a racing game that captures the anticipation of racing.  A player must manipulate the distance traveled on the current turn in order to maximize distances traveled in future turns.  The player that simply maximizes each and every turn is the loser.  Use the track pieces to make track layouts for other racing games.  Bumped my rating to 10 after inventing a way to play Bolide with this game's race courses.

Excellent components, plastic bikes, variable track pieces, and dice mechanic a little like Das Motorspiel.  WOuld benefit experienced players to have a timer or chess clock, maybe to increase tension in moves.  Also recommend not counting out moves.  That is move your piece as you go, and no take backs.  This allows for mistakes and a flavor more like the split second decisions in a real race.

Great game.  I really like this game. Every race so far has been close.  Really good rules for simulating moto gp racing.  The bikes look awesome.  I own two games plus another set of 6 bikes - 18 bikes and plenty of track!!!

Played a game the other day and the red bike passed the blue bike on the last corner of the last lap.  The blue bike had only 1 engine point left so it was relegated back to 2nd place with little chance of winning.  On the next turn the red bike who also only had 1 engine point left rolled a redline 12 (double 6's) and subsequently blew the engine allowing the blue bike to coast to an easy win.  The red bike did not finish with only 4 spaces to go to the finish line.  Wow, what a game.  For the excitement factor that game had it!

Quite fast and nice game to play. I like opportunity which this game give a player to build long and interesting racetracks.

In some aspects this game is quite nice race simulation (interaction between bikes, effects of track layout etc.), but there are some drawbacks such as too much randomness in moving bike on track, or the corners themselves. With some luck you can go through very harsh hairpin with maximum speed, and sometimes you have to go through it in 2 or 3 moves...

But in spite of those minuses it is game worth playing.

Buyers and players will be attracted to the die cast motorcycles for tokens. Opening the box reveals a set of pieces that can form a large variety of tracks, both pre-designed and your own. Reading the manual reveals three levels of difficulty. Problem? Players not into it fully will become bored before the vehicles make the last lap.

HUGE PLUS: quality of pieces
PLUS: variety of tracks
MINUS: the boredom factor

RATING: N/A
The mechanics make sense and work fine, but this game was mostly a boring, uneventful affair. I did find myself getting into it a little more when things were close. The advanced rules might help, but I'm not overly inspired to find out.

I think part of the problem is the game coasted by predominately on luck. Yes you got to make decisions but they were obvious and uninspired. 

Not terrible, but games like Snow Tails and Formula D have this one beat hands down.

Great bits, and some fun.  But I wasn't impressed.  The game is based on the flip-dice system first seen in Das Motorsportspiel.  Cornering rules are totally different though.

In theory six laps is called for, but I was pleased we stopped with 3.  Wear points would be especially dear in the 6 lap race, and seemed to be consumed at a reasonable rate during our 3 lap race.

For me, the dice were just too much.  After really enjoying Leader 1, I felt MotoGrandPrix was a big step backwards.  Since I already have Das Motorsportspiel, PS, and Motorchamp, I feel like I've got enough dice-based race games.  This game did not bring enough new ideas to excite me.

RATING: 7
The flip dice system is brilliant!

It's fast, furious, and fun. The best part of this game lies in the fact that you don't have to count out your optimal move like many other racers.

The modular track system makes this fantastic, and I can even see tons of room for house rules to add depth if we ever wanted to.

The system allows for real back and forth battles, and plays VERY quickly with little down time between turns.

It's light, that's sure enough, so more hardcore racer fans probably won't be satisfied; but this one will fit in to most gamer's scope of acceptance.

Update:

Rating rises 1 point after racing on a more complex track with full rules and more players.

First impression (6 players): A rather long dice luck fest. I kind of like the idea how you use rolls (you can sometimes choose to take opposite side of the rolled number depending on curve) but it doesn't work here as your main objective in game is just to avoid those curves where you cannot choose flexibly enough at all cost.

Received as a Secret Santa gift (in Feb, long story).

Don't bother with the basic or standard rules.  And use a minimum of 4 bikes when playing, any less and you are missing out on the interaction among the bikes on the track.  That being said, I like games that have multiple levels of rules so you can jump right in and play and then add complexity later.  Good racing game.  It is not Formula DE but is on par with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Great racing game! If you are a fan of Formula D or De, then I think you really will enjoy this Moto racing game as well. The track parts are excellent quality; they fit together like puzzle pieces. The motorcycles come on plastic stands that allow the bike to tip left, right, forward and backward. These are all possible moves you will be using in the game. The bikes don't all work super well, some will not hold their angles due to craftsmanship. But this is not too detrimental to the game, just not as visually appealing. The track markers are useful for marking difficulty of corners, hills, straightaways etc. This game does take time to set up...more so than Formula D...mostly because you will build the entire track, then set the difficulty of all the corners, etc.

RATING: 8
Motorcycle racing...yes! A not too complex racing game with a puzzle track to allow many different layouts. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Note:  Basic game is really bad and is obviously not serious so I didn't count it in my rating.

Standard and Expert game rules aren't that hard although they are often counter-intuitive or clunky (maybe due to a translation issue in the rules?).  I doubt the game takes 4 hours finish 6 laps as some have claimed.  Probably half that after you know what you are doing.

Tactically the rules and play value are pretty dull.  Turns are rated for difficulty but you can fly right through them without stopping (they only hurt you a little when you stop on them at the end of a turn).  So the turn by turn dice and movement decisions are pretty boring/automatic.  

It probably makes a huge difference racing with 4 or more as opposed to 3 or less, as with 3 or less you will never be fully blocked out of position.  I imagine the 4 player or more races might be more tense.

Strategically the game is better...with 6 laps and only 8 points on your three attributes, you can't go around wasting points like in Formula D where you can drop 18 points in one lap.  

Overall I think setting up the track, dealing with some of the clunkier rules on positioning, and then completing a 4 player, 6 lap race, is probably too much time spend on too little of a game.  But...the game does harbor some deep and long term strategic challenges, so there is an upside to it.

For a variety of reasons that are probably unfair to this game, I like Formula D and Powerboats better.  To end on a positive note, the physical attributes of the game pieces and components are almost all outstanding.  The Bike stems are a little shakey and not fully reliable.  But the overall look of this game is carefully built and well executed...someone put alot of effort into it, so they must believe in the underlaying quality of the game.

Feels like goose chase. Maybe it does simulate motor racing on a 'strategic' level. But going full speed (with no braking) while in a hairpin corner and just continue racing does feel very silly and is in fact deadly if you ever try it. On a racers level it does nothing to me. Track layout is mostly useless.

RATING: 5
Not the worst racing game in the world, but a long way from being the best.

Although it looks very pretty, at it's heart I struggled to see anything more than a roll & move game.  Every decision in the game was pretty obvious, and ultimately the dice will decide how the game finishes so long as everyone makes sound decisions.

It shares a similar flaw to Formula De, in that people are constantly counting ahead before actually moving, without the fix from DTM (which used a very similar dice mechanic) to force speedy play.

I was reasonably satisfied that I spent the two hours playing the game, though - as one game was enough to convince me that there is no way on this planet that the game is worth £55.  I wouldn't buy it whatever the price, as there are better, faster, more tactical and more fun race games out there, but at £55 the decision to pass is a no-brainer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun enough race game, but I can't see there's too much more to it than rolling good dice. Why should you be allowed to absolutely sprint through sharp corners just because you start the turn on a straight? Kids will like it, and it is fun because it guarantees a close game. You also need to play it super fast. But I'm happy leaving it for the odd sporadic Stoner burst once a year.

Very, very nice components for a very mediocre racing game... the motorcycles are great, and the track pieces are top notch... that saves the rating as it's low on strategy--just lots of dice rolling and flipping them to the higher number... roll, move, roll, move with little decision making... better with six players... still thinking how to improve the rules for these great bits... all that said, it's rated for ages 6+ and it's certainly a easy intro racing game for younger gamers

I will have to rewrite this entry once I've played Das Motorsportspiel, but for now I quite like MGP.  It's got a good balance of luck and skill, though the skill is very tactical in nature.  It's not at all thinky, at least not on a deep level, though the choices are not exactly trivial either.  The luck keeps more casual players in the game.

Most important to me, though, was the modular track.  Formula D should go to hell for its expansion system.

This was a lot of fun, and the minis were gorgeous.  I also love the mechanic of tilting the miniature on it's side to represent a turn.  But race games are race games, in the end.

Bought 10th of April 2010 at Fantask.dk - 400Dkr.
Painted the bikes, now waiting for someone to play with.
Even bought two more sets to get 18 bikes and lots of track tiles!!

Fantastic motorcycle racing game capturing many of the most thrilling aspects of a GP race in an easy and exciting format.  From braking duels, corner-exit overtakings, rear-tire slipping, red-lining engines, slip-streaming and much more!  Tons of fun for racing enthusiasts and gamers!

Got it for my son. Basic rules are REALLY basic. Must try with full rules to judge it.

I tried the prototype and I think it's really good. The flip-dice system works really well. The introductory rules are easy and fun to play, while the highest rules set is a perfect simulation of a Moto GP. I look forward to it!

As you move up in the rules (beginner, standard, expert), there's more and more ways to mitigate the luck from the dice rolls. So it's not completely random, but there's certainly an element of it when you roll high in difficult turns.

My current favorite race game (though I haven't gotten to play Snow Tails yet!).  Turns move quickly (unlike Formula D) and the little motorcycles are very cool.

Moto Grand Prix es un juego con reglas rápidas basadas en tiradas de dados que permiten disfrutar de carreras de varias vueltas en un periodo de tiempo razonable.

This game is only a 7 when you add in all the rules to up the complexity a little. Otherwise it falls short of that mark. Also I have to work on tightening up the motorcyclists on their pedestals. Some of them came pretty loose.

Played once at Gen Con 2008 with mostly my regular gaming group from back home.  We had a run-away leader problem, so we'll see if one time problem or problem of the game.  Still seems to be a roll and move and whoever rolls better wins.

RATING: 8
Played a demo lap at Gencon using basic rules and was intrigued enough to purchase the game.  We've played a few games since, using "teams" and the expert rules.  So far it is living up to expectations: lots of fun and fairly exciting finishes.  Looking forward to getting 12-18 bikes on those tracks :)

Way under-rated by players who have never heard of Das Motorsportspiel.  A good bike racing game so long as you use the advanced rules.  Much like any other racing game it about maximizing your turns and minimizing your wear points.  Great components.  I found the bikes to be slightly loose but functional in all positions.

Hopefully the standard and advanced forms of play are better.  The basic game is the least fun I have had with a game in a long time.  At least in Monopoly you have some choice to make after you roll and move.

Great components with fast, fun gameplay.   It seems a bit simplistic out of the box, but the speed of play makes it exciting and fun.

The play mechanic with the dice is interesting.  Rolling 2 dice and being allowed to shift up/down to account for cornering.  I like that you can build the tracks which adds an extra element of replayability.  The races seem to end up pretty close.  The dozen or so games I've played have all ended with riders on same lap.  Being a sportbike owner prejudices my opinion a bit.  I think included in my 7 rating is probably at least 1 point for subject matter fan bias.

Some things just shouldn't be made into board games.  Motorcycle racing is one of those things.

Playing anything less than the advanced rules offers nothing more than a roll and move game, and a bland and empty experience at that.

The expert version spices things up, but goes on way too long for my liking.

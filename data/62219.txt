RATING: 6
This is a deep game with decisions resulting in some very subtle shifts which aren't immediately obvious. Very interesting therefore - at least for the first few plays. If it doesn't become obvious/boring then and holds it's promise then my rating will rise. Two things to watch for though. Analysis paralysis can be significant and so can downtime (particularly as it can be a little difficult/tedious to keep track of dominance in a region)

RATING: N/A
A really good mix of war game and euro mechanisms with a very intriguing theme make for a great game. This game is one of the few games that makes area control enjoyable to me. The excellent rule set allows for a decently quick understanding of all of the actions (considering the game depth), and the player sheets give a perfect length description of the actions so you rarely have to flip through the rules to check something. The only thing that brings the rating of this game down a bit is the 3 hour length, as it stops me from getting it to the table as often as I would like.

What a beast. The Euro answer to TI3? But not as long or complex. Yet at least as satisfying, though doesn't generate stories the way TI3 does. I like them both a lot but this is more my flavour. Like pistachio vs chocolate. or something.

RATING: 9
Every thing about this game is very well made and the rule books seems very well done with lots of examples.  This looks like a gamers game so I might not ever win this game.  I enjoyed my first play and so did my gaming group.  We played with 5 players and my best guess is that playing time is about 4 hours but could be quicker with some players getting ready for their turn while the person in front of them finishes their turn.

This game is freaking awesome! My wife and I played one game and we both love it. Even with just two players it is a fully enjoyable game, somewhat the way Agricola is. 
If you like worker placement this is THE worker placement game, the others are now just filler. 
The area control mechanic really sets this one apart from other worker placement games.

I have found the perfect game, Dominant Species. Simple to teach and play, no rules issues, constant player interaction and really tough decisions all the way through. also works from 2 through to 6 players. After every game you are left with so many after thoughts of, could have, should have and will do. No perfect strategies and constant evolving plans. the game is thematic and emotive too. A 10 out of 10 from me.

First, I want to say that Combat Commander is one of the best games the human mind has ever produced.

But Dominant Species has the serious blahs. There's this cool and intriguing area control game involved, but players are forced to play a surprisingly involved and annoying worker placement game in order to get to it.

I hate having to jump through beaurocratic hoops to get to the good stuff.

Love Dominant Species, would have gotten a 9 if only it did not have the tendency to act as an extreme catalyst to people's AP. Unfortunately, many of the players I play with are acute sufferers, which means it is often a pain to bring to the table (my pain, not theirs!).

The best heavyweight game I have played. Our four player run took 3.5 hours and everyone played quickly with little distraction. The theme is great - the mechanics work well together, but as with all long games, it is a real drawn out affair if you are so far behind in the mid-game that you have no real hope of catching up.

RATING: 8
Dominant Species is a war game with an animal theme on it.  The game is extremely deep and has a long play time of 3 hours (at least, depending on the AP of your group).  Because of this it's difficult to get it to the table.  It is a great game, and would probably not turn down a game (with the right group of people).  However, I might consider trading it away at some point because of how little it gets played.

RATING: 8
Was fun but just too long. There is no reason for the game to go on so long. Having more species on the board doesn't allow you to do anything else other than score more points. Next time we play we will shorten the domination deck.

Finally got in a play of this well-reputed monster of a game. It was indeed quite solid, but terribly lengthy. I can't say there was much that could be thematically trimmed away although the end of game score-every-tile was an extra nail in the coffin to me. It gave me an epic feeling at glacial speed. The complexity of calculations at the result of actions and domination cards encourages lengthy think-a-thon turns which I truly wish could be addressed. It would make for a much improved experience and dramatically shortened play time. Yet for all that, I quite liked it. Would I play it again? In the right mood, I certainly would.

After 1st play:
At Dominant Species you twist and twist and twist and then do a little tweak and finish with a somersault. There are so many ways to affect the situation on the board that you easily tie your brain into a neat knot.

The heart of the game is pure area control. What makes it more complicated than any other similar game is that each area can be controlled in two different ways. Before scoring there are several phases each turn and every single one of these phases can affect the situation considerably. Therefore, it's really hard to plan ahead.

But still I enjoyed the game more and more as it went longer. The art of the game is functional, but there's no way you could call it beautiful.

If I just had time, I'd play Dominant Species any time. Unfortunately 3-5 hours is not something you always have at your disposal.

To my big surprise I sold this in an auction. Might be that I'll regret it later, but at this point of my life I just felt like getting rid of games that haven't seen any or very little play in the past 3-4 years. It seems that nowadays the games hitting the table are action packed sub 90 minute games instead of longer ones like Dominant Species. And the fact that you essentially get the same experience from El Grande but in much simpler and more forgiving format, made the decision easier. I might get the iOS app of Dominant Species, which should make the game run faster since less time will be spent on calculating who's in control and who's dominating each area.

 If I only had more space to store my games...

RATING: 8.5
Truly a game of 'survival'!

As the ice-age encroaches can your species adapt and migrate quickly enough to maximise the dwindling resources?

Perhaps a strategy of 'quiet attrition' over 'out & out dominance' is key in the early part of the game with a view to 'rapid expansion' [particularly of the Tundra] at the 'end game'- avoids 'tall poppy' and maximises the shifting VP distribution.

More than enough variables and permutations to ensure a 'different' game each time.

The only [minor] criticism would be that there are too many 'Dominance' cards to choose from each turn - maybe 2 or 3 instead of five may accentuate their power but lesson the number of 'major events' per turn. [edit.] Having played it a few more times I think the Domination cards work well, also acting as a game length limit [when they're gone, the game is over] also for varying the 'end game' scenario, dependant on what crds [or combination of cards] are left. The domination cards also add one of the 'random' elements into the game - along with the 'element' re-seeding at the start of each round.

It has become more enjoyable with each playing.

Third printing ordered via P500.

We've had a few games now, and I'm confident in giving in a 9 for now.  For as long as the game takes to play, it feels like it plays very fast, which really impresses me.  You're constantly taking small turns and making decisions, and any time you're not is almost certainly filled up with considering your next action.  I get bored very easily during long games with lots of downtime, and I'm very pleased to see that Dominant Species doesn't have this problem.

I've never played a euro with this much direct competition before, and it's awesome!

A wargame masquerading as a euro.  Very not for me.  I've played it a few times now and remain unconvinced.  Others will love it, I loathe it.  Biggest gripes:  Becomes bash the leader & often involves some king-making.  Swings from cards can be monstrous.  Control is illusory.  Come-from-behind wins are possible largely because those in front are busy getting smacked.  To me, that's not a fun game design.  But like I said above, others will love this.  So definitely give it a play or two or three and see whether or not it's for you.

Bad production (for eurogame standards), ugly but functional board and tiles (I have the first edition). Unique double majority control system. Nice, diverse and deep gameplay, very susceptible to kingmaking. I have played it with 2, 4, 5 and 6 and I liked it in every configuration, but it can get too long (a full game can be very satisfying, but often I would prefer to reduce the number of cards and initial cubes for a shorter game).

Me pareció un juego complicado de aprender, con demasiadas fases y complicado de ganar. Demasiadas decisiones que dependen demasiado de las decisiones que tomen los demás. Me pareció complicado el hecho de establecer una estrategia a principio del turno que fuese válida para ejecutarla a final del mismo.
En una segunda partida (acabada) se convierte en un juego más rápido y divertido. El único problema es que el que domina la tundra se puede escapar y no hay forma de alcanzarlo.

To long and heavy for my tastes to play it more often. Also some cards effects are very game breaking while other quite weak. Being able to play those strongs before others is very strong.

Not a fan of games where the scoring escalates exponentially and the brain explodes trying to calculate how to win in the last two or three moves. I prefer games that score a bit less to begin with (no one likes to lose because they got off to a bad start!) and ramp up gradually to compensate, but overall reward the most consistent player. Good game otherwise.

I really like this game.  The theme, the asynchronus Animals, the impending ice age.  Great game, highly recommended.

Played a few games on iPad and than I played a game in three with my wife and her causin, the real life play is a lot more fun and better, the game is tense and every action matters, the things you will try to do here is not letting the elements you adapt get depeled and make some very valuable actions, every action pawn have to count. The playtime is a little bit long, but sure in the end the game is worth.

Edit: played another time with 4, the game sure is better this way :D

One of the best recent eurogame designs that incooperates elements of Civilization, Wargaming and 'settlers-of-catan's' way of presentation. In some way, this game does give a nostalgic feel towards an old game....Tyranno Ex. 

No dice, no CRT charts, no chit-pull on who goes first......

An excellent game design that is clean, unlimited replayability, player interactions and multi-facet strategy to winning.

Downtime is minimal till last 1 or 2 turns but is acceptable.

With this game, El Grande looks like child's play.

Too long though, it's a really good game which feels like it maybe takes twice as long as you'd want.

Also they blend the use of animal class and animal which makes it harder for new peoples to comprehend plus maybe they should had called the domination cone an best adapted / adaption / survival cone or something such to make domination more intuitive and understandable for people.

One of the best area control games along with El Grande! Elements of worker placement are there with the selection of actions and of course the domination cards that are beautiful and many of them very deadly. What did you expect? It's a battle for survival of your species! This one is deeper than El Grande and lasts longer (like twice the time longer) but it's also an excellent game. Quality components once again from GMT and after the 3rd printing is prettier in my opinion than when it first came out. I can't recommend this enough!

RATING: 9.5
I've only played once and loved it. The only questionable part to it was the 20 minutes of end-game scoring, which seemed to do nothing more than to take the position of the player on the scoring track and multiply by two - at the cost of 20 minutes of doing math. And I'd be upset if the scores did change that much during this phase, since it's really an area control game. If there were some fiddly way to not control area through the bulk of the game and suddenly cash in at the end, I don't think that it would go well with how the rest of the game plays.

I'd probably suggest ignoring the end-game scoring and just accepting the scores as they are at the end of the final round. As said - at least in my one play - it didn't actually change the order of the players at all. So it just added a bunch of time for no purpose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This game is incredible. The only thing keeping it from a full 10 for me is the length, and the fact that teaching it to new players can be a big of a slog, and I have seen people get completely turned off by both the length and an incomplete understanding of scoring mechanics. That being said, if you're willing to play it a couple of times to really get the framework down, it is an EPIC gaming experience, one that deserves to be in every serious gamer's collection.

Played the 3p 2 animal each variant and it works VERY well, and can allow for some interesting combos and interaction. Came down to a food chain tie break, awesome experience.

It is indeed long, and there is a fair bit of recordkeeping involved. A lot of actions can shift dominance or extinction, and it can be easy to miss these shifts. There's also a lot of opportunity for AP in trying to figure out which element to take, or which element to speciate, etc. Still, a rich and epic experience.

Long, but spectacular high volume decision-making game. Very much a game of adapting and modifying your strategy turn-to-turn, very few random elements, with those that are, fit well into the theme. Feels like it has just the right amount of between-player combat elements.

There is a lot to like about Dominant Species!  The game takes a little while to learn (30-45 mins), but isn't particularly hard to play once understood.  It is a 3+ hour game, with some potential for Analysis Paralysis (AP) that I hope reduces as my friends become more familiar with the game.  Play is broken up well, however, so it is rare to wait long before doing something.

Dominant Species is an Area Control game (El Grande) with 
a lot of dynamics. The board, animals, resources, etc are all shifting due to player actions. This creates an intense and lively game that feels much shorter than the actual time it takes to play.

RULE NOTE: Be careful about scoring a hex (based on # of species/blocks) vs. Domination (based on adaptations/resources) - the same player does not always have both!

LEARNING NOTE: Highly recommended to play an abbreviated game with a friend (1 animal each, 1-2 turns, do 'end game') before trying to play with a group.

A random collection of game mechanics with cards. Is this suppose to simulate evolution or simply to waste my time?

It reminds me of Catan and that is not a compliment. What is wrong with a real map of the world or part of it!? Why using cubes instead of counters with pictures of - extinct - animals. A wasted opportunity.

The box states this a Chad Jensen game. I know now who to avoid!

What a game! Its a really heavy worker placement/ area control game. Endless posibilities. Tough decisions to make. High quality components. Minimum downtime. The mechanics really blend well with the theme. Very competitive game. Small amount of luck. Can cause AP to some players. Takes over 3 hours to play.

RATING: 9.5
Absolutely fantastic. Just one of those games that seems so natural, so well-designed, an immediate classic. Even after one unfinished game I could see this was a game with great depth that I would want to go on playing and exploring for many years. Further plays of this have only made me feel more sure.

Tips: Put the action pawn from the Dominance action on the hex that's scored. Put a spare coloured cube on the animal's token on the initiative track (and maybe on the food chain too) as otherwise it can be hard to remember who's who.

Dominant Species is a heavy euro from GMT and this is what attracted me to this game in the first place.

If you've got the time to play this, it's an utterly fantastic experience. Amazingly tense to the death; seemingly well-balanced; plenty to ponder over (but not too much) and a procedural way to resolve actions. It's bloody flawless. I waited years to buy it and I'm glad I got the prettier version which came long after I first started drooling over the game.

I'd play this masterpiece whenever my friends can tolerate the playtime.

Update: as a two-player game, this is fantastic too! That's with or without the 'Play Two Animal' variant.

RATING: 9
First Play, November 2011, Comment: A good game with some clever mechanics. 7 of 10.

Second Play, June 2012, Comment: A better game than I  realized after the first play.  This game is an excellent mix of theme, originality, El Grande, and Caylus. The game plays like a slugfest, punch after punch, which can be fun with the right group.  Raising it to an 8 of 10. 

Third Play, June 2012, Comment: Greater appreciation for the many layers and complexity of game play.  Raising it to a 9.

Fourth Play, June 2012, Comment: First 5 player game, not as good as with 4. Later rounds of game can be decided by 1-3 card plays, and thus, players need to take their time on these moves.  If they don't play very carefully, game outcome becomes a bit randomized, calling into question why the preceding 3 hours of game play were even played. Seems like a slight flaw.  Lowering to an 8. 

Twelfth Play, August 2012, Comment: Okay, whatever faults it has, and there are some, this is just an incredibly interesting game to play and consider from a design perspective.  Back to a 9.

A few thoughts for those players who find the game too long, chaotic, or vicious, with too many options for king making.  Because these complaints are essentially directly linked to the cards and card effects, and some in our group, have these issues....to improve the game for our group, we typically take out the three extra action pawn cards (which lengthen the game), and if we are in the mood to diminish the nastiness, we also take out the Blight and Catastrophe cards, or perhaps 2 other semi-nasty ones.  This tends to dial down all of the aforementioned problems.  In sum, with card selection/reduction options, this game is VERY customizable, something that you should understand straight up.  Have problems with some of the cards?  Take them out.  The game can stand on its own merits, without playing with ALL the cards.  Enjoy the version you make.

I did not think highly of this one after the first play. It was too long and too random, but could not stop thinking about it after the first session. Tried it again and now it is easily the best game I have played. It is an extremely dynamic game that may at first seem too random but really just rewards anticipating all the card effects. It's just hard to get to the table at times.

Way too much going on in this one for me.  Wheels within wheels within wheels.  The mechanics are beautiful and well thought out.  However, the interaction between the different actions is very complicated and intricate.

Dominant Species won my heart pretty quickly.  The first game we played, I knew I would want to play it more.  Granted, we had a few rules wrong, but it likely wouldn't have changed the outcome much.

The second game, rectified and sporting a full 6 players, practically ate my brain.  We pretty much all loved it (birds got understandably angsty after he got combination mass exodus > cataclysm'd around the 2/3rd mark) even though it really did require a ton of mental focus.  The board is crowded, species are always dying, and things are never QUITE going as well as you'd like.  And it's perfect that way.

Fun, rewarding, aggressive.  My 2nd favourite game.

Thanks to a disastrous first play through, which I believe has ruined the chances of ever getting this to the table with my usual group ever again. I take responsibility for having not read the rules fully prior to play time, so we did the play and read as you go thing. I'm sad, as this game I found to be really interesting and it had a lot of things going on to try and do, which was neat. Again, only 1 play through with three players, but I felt each species had its own perks and drawbacks making them unique. 

Update: Think I'm just going to have to put this up for trade as I doubt I'll get it to the table again. Played only once.

I wanted to play it, and was excited by the theme during rules explanation.  In practice, I found it to be a tactical downtime fest which quickly wore out its welcome.  Despite the plain production, just a little more theme might have been enough to suspend that disbelief.  At this point I think there should be a name, like AP (analysis paralysis), which denotes a game that encourages a player to apply lots of calculation to a decision only to have the game world change entirely as a result of subsequent player decisions.  Fool me once, etc.  Even with a much more brisk pace, it's hard for me to picture finding the decisions interesting and valuable.  Glad I tried it, though, and I'd still try the card game,

For the turns, you get to program a variety of moves. Some may be rendered useless while you are taking your turn. Others will be rendered useless during the resolution of your collective turns.

RATING: 8
A tough, heavy, but nicely balanced game. 

Quite literally, survival of the fittest. The action selection and execution mechanics are reminiscent of Age of Empires III, with the game essentially revolving around action order selection, plus two different kinds of board area control. But there's lots of cutthroat competition, with species dying off all over the place. The whole thing is very thematic, and the dominance cards provide added variablity between games (although they can also introduce some imbalance, depending on the game situation).

I only did one play with three, and it did feel like it would be a lot tighter with more players, which should make it more interesting, though potentially also with more downtime (we finished in around two and a half hours, with two newbs). There was still lots of competition on the board though, so I think the game should scale nicely at least with 3-5.

Edit: One more play with four, I'm starting to feel the game might be slightly too long - it gets a bit repetitive towards the end. Still liking it a lot, more plays will tell how it goes.

RATING: 9
An excellent game that somehow kept six people interested for six hours. With something like Illuminati I play for one and a half and already I'm reaching for the Valium, so this is quite something. Also, the scoring was really close for a game with no obvious catch-up mechanic. I thought it was great!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It looks drab, it's dense as fuck and also requires some elaborate scoring every turn. I should not like it, but the strategic aspects make me come back to the game. Oh and yes, 4 hours minimum for me. Give it a try if you like brain-twisting, very competitive and slightly asymmetric strategy.

Waited through a few plays of Dominant Species before commenting. 

This game is incredibly good, but almost feel like it's too complex to REALLY sort out a long term strategy. This could either be considered a good or a bad thing. The game forces you to react to your current situation and make the best of it. 

That said, there's a decided lack of RNG in this game, and so it gets plus points for that.

Dominant species gets better with each play, and deeper with more experienced players. There is a major learning curve that admittedly I'm not even to the top of yet prior to being able to form a strategy and see it through. In most cases, you're reacting to the game state rather than actively driving the board.

What I find incredibly hilarious about this game is that so many games love to claim that they are the perfect cross of an "Ameritrash" and a "Euro". This game is truly a cross between "Euro" and "Wargame"


------

This has been in rotation for a long while now. We play it every so often. It's still a great game, but every time I play it now, it always feels like the game lasts one turn too long. I'm starting to wonder if just removing 5 random cards at the beginning of each game could introduce some variance and replay value to the game.

Un juego especial. Realmente bueno Todo está perfectamente integrado. la mecánica de Mayorías integrada con la de Colocación de Trabajadores; puteo junto con apoyo solidario; asimetría y evolución de las especies junto con eventos...

Acciones sencillas pero directas, sin la exclusión de nadie pues las acciones se pueden repetir y eso ayuda a jugadores que sufren con juegos como Caylus o Agricola.
Acciones que modifican el tablero (losetas) y a las especies (su adaptación), que las matan y que las anulan eliminando su ecosistema. que permiten puntuar y conseguir eventos, el orden del turno. Es que todo funciona bien.

Me parece un juegazo. Duración justa, destrucción de neuronas comedida, risas en algunos momentos y que permite a seis jugadores compartir mesa cosa que ahora mismo en el grupo es esencial. Un arte realmente estupendo con unos materiales supercuidados. Absolutamente recomendable. Un diez

Good game, with lots of interesting decisions. The theme is also great, and feels very integrated.

On the down side, it's quite a long game, and a bit too AP-prone for my tastes. Also, while I don't mind being mean in a game, this one pushes that limit a little bit too far. This, in such a long game, tends to be frustrating for the receiving end in those otherwise clever attacks.

An acomplished design, with many clever features.  But, like History of the World, you need to be prepred to invest in the journey. take the hits (its a war game in disguise) and enjoy the flow.  I did, but not sure how often I want to invest the time.  As insects, I spent most of the game a distant sixth. only to pull it back to lose on the tie break of charated strength.

Rating based on my desire to play - as it is described.  But as a game design I would rate it as 8/10.

Second game, knowing the plot, was a lot more agoninsing and engaging.  But big potential for AP.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Quite some rules to remember what everything does. Takes quite a while to play. Because most of times when a player gains or loses an adaptation token you have to check the domination markers on the whole board and adjust accordingly, also when a new token is added to the main board the same checking must be made but this time is easier because it only matters on 3 tiles at most.
It's a very well thought out game.
It's an area control game but where both quantity and quality matters. You want to be able to have many species on a tile, for scoring purposes, but also be more adaptable to the environment in that tile than the other players, so you can claim domination cards when the scoring round comes.
Everything works well together. Requires some long term planning and short term as well. Available on the IOS.

Nagyon nagy élmény volt! Ez az első olyan játék, amin el kell gondolkodnom, hogy talán még a Caylusnál is jobb... Ehhez persze még játszanom kell vele, remélem lesz alkalmam minél több féle létszámmal kipróbálni, de már a kétszemélyes is nagyon bejött.

Jöjjön a részletes ajnározás: először is a játék nagyon szép. A doboza az újfajta fényes GMT-s doboz, amit nagyon szeretek. A tábla is első osztályú, a felépítése nagyon logikus, letisztult. A kártyák és fák is jók. Biztos van, aki szerint ez így absztrakt, de szerintem sokkal átláthatóbbak a kis kockák, mintha pókok meg dinók lennének helyettük:)
Nemcsak a játék külsejére, hanem a tartalmára is találó a letisztult szó, kevés játéknál érezni, hogy ennyire egzakt, jól letesztelt. Worker Placement játék, végig ugyanazok az akciók állnak rendelkezésre, többségük nagyon ötletes. Maga a témaválasztás is jó, bármennyire szeretem is a történelmet, néha már unalmas az 1000-dik római meg egyiptomi játék. Az absztrakt külső ellenére is átjön a tematika, a kiszorítósdi, a szaporodás, és a nagyon jól kitalált dominancia-mechanizmus. Szerintem zseniális a jég terjedése, és a létszám vs. dominancia kettősség, egyik közvetlen győzelmi pontra váltható, másik pedig kártyákhoz juttat. A kártyák nagyon egyediek, nem egy kaptafára készültek, és nagyon erősek is szinte kivétel nélkül.
Ennyire dinamikus játékot még nem láttam, egyik pillanatban egyikünk dominált a teljes térképen, másik pillanatban a másikunk, ebből következően nem sok esélyt látok arra, hogy egy játék mondjuk a felénél eldőljön... Nehéznek tűnik elhúzni. Nagyon kíváncsi lennék, hogy ha valaki tiszta stratégiát játszik, az mennyire kifizetődő (pl. mindig jegesedésre vagy versenyre rámenni). Elsőre úgy tűnt, hogy túlságosan taktikai játék, bármilyen stratégia 1 kör alatt dugába dőlhet. Nincs a játéktáblán, ami tuti a miénk, talán csak a megszerzett pontok (bár kártyával még azt is csökkenthető)... Amit kifelejtettem, hogy a 6 állatfajta speciális előnyei is nagyon ötletesek.
A játék alapja a konfrontáció, ahogy azt sejteni lehet a címéből, a sértődékeny embereknek annyi:)


Féltem, hogy nagyon nehéz lesz a játék. Nos, a szabály maga kifejezetten egyszerű, hála a nagyon logikus szabálykönyvnek (a 20 oldal fele példa és szemléltető ábra). Viszont a 12 akciót és a táblán lévő viszonyokat átlátni már 2 ember esetén is komoly teljesítmény. Csak bevállalós eurogémereknek ajánlom!

A szabály egyelőre csak angolul lelhető fel. Ezt leszámítva nyelvfüggőséget csak a kártyák (27 db) jelentenek, meg a segédlet (tudtommal készül a magyarítás). A 2 személyes játék bő 3 óra volt (nem fix körös a játék).

Ha mindenképpen hibát kellene mondanom, akkor hármat tudnék mondani: a dobozban szűkösen fér el az anyag (micsoda hiba:)), a 12 féle akciót kicsit jobban "kitáblázhatták" volna, nehéz megjegyezni, hogy melyik pontosan mit csinál, kellett pár kör, mire beleszoktunk. És végül az is hiba szerintem, hogy ha nagyon buta emberek játsszák a játékot, előfordulhat, hogy sose lesz vége, mert nem fogyasztják el a paklit. De ez legyen az ő bajuk:)
---
Még annyit, hogy a pakli nagy ötlet, bár épp hibaként róttam fel egy sorral fentebb, mivel akár a végtelenségig is húzható emiatt a játék, de annyi előnye mindenképp van, hogy nem függ a játékosszámtól a játékidő! Sőt mivel kevesebb akció jut egy emberre, lehet hogy nagyobb létszámnál még gyorsabban is lemegy az egész.
---
Na kipróbáltuk 4 fővel, sokkal hosszabb, mint ketten (5 óra volt kb. tisztán), mivel sokkal nehezebb átlátni, egy akció végrehajtása több idő.
---
5 fős játék: mindenki vezetett legalább 1 kör végén (6 körös játékban). Ilyen létszámnál már elég hátrányosnak érzem a később következő fajok helyzetét. (Nem nagyon van más ilyen Worker placement játék, ahol nem tudsz egyből kezdővé válni, hanem csak araszolgatni tudsz a sorrendjelzőn, már ha az előrébb következők egyáltalán engedik. Tehát simán lehet, hogy végig utolsóként lép egy faj. Nem biztos, hogy a képességei ezt a hátrányt kiegyenlítik.)

RATING: 5.6
Interesting and thinky to make it a good game, and with great production value. Unfortunately the art is kind of bland, the player pieces uninteresting and the playtime too long to make this one stay on my shelf, especially since explaining the admittedly heavy rules to new people everytime is a drag.

Very complex game, there is a lot of things you must factor in in each move and still others' actions may turn your plans upside down, which makes your control rather limited. I wouldn't mind this in a 1,5h game but it takes twice (at least) that much time. Another issue (alongside huge downtimes) is tiresomeness of constant checking of dominations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Love this game.  So much happens, and there are so many ways to win that this game is great.  The theme of evolving your species is fun and adaptation is the name of the game.  The length on this one is a bit long, and the end game scoring is a little confusing for those just starting.  This is also a challenge to teach and learn since there is so much to keep track of, depsite the fact that all the info you need is listed on the board itself, it is still daunting for a new player to jump on board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
Clearly one of the good area control games. There are interesting mechanics and I like the cards and the duality between elements (dominance) and quantity of species (direct scoring). This duality however offers a bit too many choices. I'd like to see a connection between these two fields of conflict.
I found the worker placement choices excellent. Although the elements system...I think it should shrink a bit because the choices there are a bit confusing.
Never try the 2/3 player variant where each player controls 2 animals. 
Thematically it reminded me of evo and valley of the mammoths. A bit overpriced. Graphic design is good (I'd like an area in each tile to place the cubes that have already moved for that round), and I wouldn't mind some illustrations at that price.

RATING: 8
This is a game designed with ambition!!
It is a great and unique game, with LOTS of player interaction and lots of chaos to control, and a very tactical nature (it is a game about adaptation, after all...).
In the very first game I was playing the Mammals, was behind in initiative order and got crushed by repeated cards played by my opponents. This probably becomes less of an issue with repeated plays, but I found the turn order mechanic and card strength as possible flaws.
Anyway, the game is clearly subject to a problem of analysis paralysis, since every single move of every single player can definitely change the board position. So, it is a very long game!
Need to play more games to fully grasp, but I sense the potential of a rise in my initial vote (7.5)...
Update july 29, 2011: after the first few frustrating plays, I can feel the game grow on me. Now it is a 8.

RATING: 5
el grande meets AOE3. I prefer el grande for the territory control aspect, and much prefer aoe3 for the action selection.

the game works, but is waaaaaay to long for what it is. 3 plays of el grande in that same time would be a lot more satisfying. also, for such a long game randomness with card draws and general lack of control over your fate and being on the mercy of others is a very big drawback.

this feels like a nice enough 1.5h game, but at 4.5h I am not at all sure I'd want to ever play it again.

RATING: 7
I've only played this game once and I look forward to playing again but only with the right circumstances, ie other new players. To be honest, I'm scared of this game. It's a solid 3 hour time commitment, which is fine except that the game can be pretty unforgiving. Slip up in the first half hour and you get to sit back and watch yourself lose for 2 1/2 hours. I'm determined to get competent enough to hold my own, however, because the game has so much going for it. Great theme, great combination of mechanics, and a really cool set of variable player powers.

UPDATE: I've owned this game for almost a year and I still haven't played a game to completion. It isn't for lack of trying, either. In fact, I really like this game a lot and I'm dying to find some players. The trouble is my wife doesn't find it fun... like AT ALL. Hrmph!

Dominant Species is basically the worker placement version of El Grande.  I'm not really a fan of randomness, kingmaking, and/or screw the leader.  However, this game does offer plenty of interesting decisions.       

Game length is also an issue, especially the last turn.  Choosing where to migrate before end game scoring can drag something awful, but that's the price for playing a more complex version of El Grande.

It's intimidating when you open it up, but just follow the rules in order, and every step makes sense. I think it's vulnerable to analysis paralysis due to the number of moving parts; I think a good house rule would be to set a 1-minute timer for each player's AP placement; if they can't make a decision, their AP is placed automatically (via whatever method you like).

Here is another fine example of a EuroChad design.  This one has quite a bit of back and forth competition. I have to remember to sometimes just ride the coattails of other players while I rebuild my species to become dominant another day.

12/2012 - first time with learning game with 3 players. Love the game. Close score with winner leading by 4 and 2,3 tied at end. Mammals, Arachnids, Insects. When learning, we take a seriously AP approach to figure things out and get the rules right - even breaking to consult BGG for rules questions/errata mid-game. That 5hrs doesn't include the 1.5 hr read-through/discussion. Worth it. Figure we can burn through this game pretty quick now, having a much deeper understanding of the mechanics. Nice flow in the changing conditions - 4 major shifts in land control throughout the game. Funny that we didn't see enough usage of Competition and Migration categories. Heavy activity in the Speciation and Domination categories. 

2012-12-15 3-player, crushed by player playing heavy Domination strategy. I took the Ice-sheet approach and nearly caught up in the end with complete domination of the Ice-sheet space, but, naturally, got killed on the domination points for each tile.

2012-12-18 - 3-player, shortened game (mid-week game nights are tough with this one, just outside the edge). Won this with sheer volume of tile domination at end-game scoring assisted by other two players duking it out in what use to be sea dominated territory. Just that they didn't spread out enough. I Wanderlusted 3 times on that last round with high scoring tiles which sealed the deal on the tile placement as well as the tile scoring.

First Play: I came last, I made some horrfic mistakes and it is probably the best game I've ever played. 

The placement element has many options that really do need to be properly balanced with whats on the board. There may be a tendancy for AP with some players so a timer might need to be shipped in but once the mechanic is run through this is an incredibly slick game.

The limited randomness with card and tile draws is all manageable. You see whats coming out and need to legislate for it. If you are weak in one area defend it. If you lose that advantage then thats your fault, and no one elses.

A brutal savage game of ultimate screwage. Genius.

Played the variant where 4 cards are removed (3 x AP gain). This does provide a shorter game and a flavour of the full version but there does seem to be a large ingredient missing and given a choice I'd rather play the full game.

RATING: 7
I like the theme and most of the mechanics of this game. It does seem like too much is determined by your draw of a species at the beginning of the game. Overall, I thought it was fun, but it seemed to run a turn or two too long. 

Overall, a decent game, but I would recommend you try before you buy.

Checking for dominance in the game is a brutally irritating calculation that ruins the smooth flow of play. And that the rules include a "you snooze, you lose" clause implies the designers knew how irritating this was going to be.

A really remarkable, deep game. What truely sold me was the rule book. I don't think I've ever read a better one. Clear rules, great examples, and quick to read. I didn't even catch any spelling/grammer errors. Very easy to learn, but grinding on strategy. You must be able to adjust to the chaos of an evolving world while keeping the other species in check. Fail, and you will become extinct. This game drips with theme (or should that be oozes?).

A real beast of a game. It's a strange mix of euro and ameritrash with a dash of randomness. The result is an amazingly deep game that is captivating for the whole duration. It very much has a bash the leader feel and when everybody is after you there's not much you can do. But over the course of the game things seem to balance out. One bad thing I can say about the game is that the possibillities are so overwhelming that it is not a wise idea to play with AP prone people. Definitely a game to play with a timer as things can get out of hand quickly. Another minus is the tedious task of keeping track of dominance in all the different territories. I've heard people complain about the components. But allthough minimal they are very functional and give the game a clean and crisp look. I like them.

After playing various times, this is another game that I have a love/hate relationship with. On the one hand, the innovative design, the player interaction, the special abilities each animal class has, the majority versus domination concept, the area majority / worker placement mechanics and a theme that hits a home run with me, makes it a sure winner of a game in my book. On the other hand, the unpredictability and the randomness set forth in some of the cards and player interaction has left me a bit frustrated. Maybe it's the Euro blood in me, but I prefer to be in control of my destiny.

For example, in a six player game played by my friends and I, on the last round the card that randomly lets you pull out an element from a draw bag and place it on your animal/class player board was played. My main competition/opponent happened to pull out the exact element needed (an element on my player board) to directly compete with me in the domination of the tiles we shared. The board completely changed in that one instant from me having dominance to him having dominance. Then, of course, the card that scores dominance and triggers the end of the game was played. Needless to say, it cost me the win. If my opponent would have pulled any other type of element from the bag, it would have been a different story.

Despite the aforementioned, I rate this gamer's game highly because of the innovation it brings, the tough tense decisions that have to be made and the sheer fun factor. Despite the game having a 4 weight on the Geek, I found the rules intuitive and very well thought out. Maybe I need more experience to mitigate the chaos and randomness? Maybe the challenge is in managing what other players and cards will bring?

Anyways, beautiful design! I can't wait to get it on the table again!

So, finally got this played last night. With 4 players, which should be the optimal player count.

This is clearly a "big game", it feels rather epic and I appreciate that. Of the other games I have tried, I think it comes closest to games like A Game Of Thrones and Eclipse. I think if I had tried this game a year ago I would have been over the moon about it. At that point in time I was really in love with games like A Game Of Thrones and Eclipse and this would have fit right in.

For some reason I have steered a bit away from those type of games. I still really do enjoy them when they get to the table, but that doesn't happen very often. But they do give you that epic feel which not a lot of other games do. Thinking about it, I think Twilight Struggle might be sort of filling that whole for me, even though it is a whole other kind of game.

Anyway, this is a great design and a really liked it a lot. In the game I had built up a HUGE lead and felt 100% certain that I would win, but I had forgotten that there is a final round scoring where I do to the bash the leader phenomenon had very few cubes left on the table and hence got overtaken by ONE measly point.

I did think that it went a bit long. I think our game lasted about 4 hours and I think the suggestion made by someone here to remove the cards that give an extra action pawn is a good one.

My concern is that this is gonna be tough to get to the table in general.

Love this game! 

Really filled my desire for a euro with constant in your face combat. Sure I have euros or hybrids where you you slowly undermine the other player's engines or just deny them of worker placement spots, but here your literally wiping their species off of the face of the earth for the rest of the game! Sometimes in HUGE quantities by just taking away a single food source their animal needed to survive. I don't own anything like it and it's fantastic.

The actions are easy to understand at a basic level. There's no 'bad' action to take, simply things that are better for you current situation. Even though I had a three hour game, all of the individual plays felt quick, especially since it's a good idea to watch what other people are doing - keeping you totally engaged. And even though the screenshots of this game looked kind of bland it looked better than expected in person and it was nice being able to play a game without all this glossy chrome layered on okay gameplay (miniatures, lots of art, what have you) and just being able to enjoy the fantastic mechanics of it all for the first time in a while.

This is more than a good game, it is a great game, but it just plays too long for me. I rarely have time to play a 5-hour game, and when I do I'd rather play two games in that time. This is in particular true for a brain-burner like this. So, I will probably try to avoid this game. However, there is no doubt that is a fantastically well-crafted game. Everything hangs together so well, and as an evolutionary biologist it must say it does have a lot of evolutionary concepts included.

RATING: 8
Such a chaotic game... but can be a ton of fun if played with players that allow the game to keep moving.  I personally think 4 players is the sweet spot, and am hoping to get this one played at that count more often.  A game that rewards repeated players for sure since the deck is static (same cards used every game), but the replayability is there since the order in which the cards come out changes the game completely.  Really fun game that I have not played enough of... and hope to change that over the coming months / years!

Excellent game design.  Balances complexity with simplicity while allowing tactical and strategic variations.  Great design!

Update:  After a half-dozen plays, I have upgraded this to a 10.  I cannot get enough of this game.  DomSpec is not only a superb play with incredible controlled swing and surprise, it is a tactical exercise without equal.  The more players, the greater the individual skill of the player comes into its own.  This game will be my first suggestion off of the shelf every time.

RATING: 5
I don't understand what space this game is trying to occupy?  Is there really a demand for a longer, more chaotic, less interesting El Grande with a better theme?  I keep waiting for another area majority game worthy of being in my collection, but nothing yet has offered something distinct enough to warrant playing instead of El Grande and it has been over a decade.

Let's start with the most obvious flaw, the game takes 3+ hours which is most definitely not the right length for this type of game.  A good area majority game has a lot of take-that, kingmaking in it.  These are aspects that demand a fairly short running time, even El Grande is slightly too long in my estimation.  There are numerous stories on BGG of people being out of the running early and while that seems unlikely it is clear that at the end of Dominant Species you can't plausibly say that your score reflects the proficiency of your play.  There are just too many things that can potentially hose you in such a long game that you can do very little about.  Such things are thematic for a game about evolution and by the scores on BGG a lot of people like the experience, but as a game Dominant Species fails.

A large part of my disdain from the game comes from how much of a Frankenstein of prior games it is.  The domination cards are identical to El Grande's action cards except without any attempt to balance them (I am sure many people consider this a good thing).  Then the glaciation clearly takes cues from a number of games, Trias comes to mind if only for the thematic similarity, and the worker placement portion is SO obvious, not containing an iota of clever design.  This is a common fault with worker placement and it is why the system needs to hibernate for awhile and rejuvenate itself before returning.  Then there is the whole domination mechanism that the game wants you to constantly track for reasons that I do not understand.

Lastly, I am not sure the theme is really that good.  Elements seem to have no affinities to the land area they sit upon.  And why are completely different phylums competing?  I think the game would be far more interesting if it tried to work in some of the symbiosis that obviously occurs in nature rather than some weird competition between spiders and apes.

Anyways, Dominant Species is not worth the time or hefty price tag.  Go play El Grande instead.

RATING: 9
What a masterpiece!! One of the best themes out there. Lot of people are calling it abstract but I strongly disagree. Sure your species are just little wooden cubes, and the land tiles are just hexes, but the way it plays out and how the mechanics force you into certain situations really makes you feel like your struggling to survive as the ice age approaches. It can be very tough for new players to know what the hell to do (unfortunately I am still in that category) but what deep heavy 3+ hour game doesn't have this characteristic? The king making and overall chaos issues don't even bother me just because it is so enjoyable to play. Because of the length and the overall feel to this game I would put it up beside Through the Ages as my "epic" go to games. This category is reserved for games that melt your brain and completely wear you out and Dominant Species defiantly does both.

The night after I first played this game I could sleep. Just laid in my bed staring a the ceiling analysing my first epic game of Dominant Species. I strongly feel that the amount of sleep one gets after playing a board game for the first time is inversely proportional to the quality of that game. This shoots Dominant Species to the top of the charts.

The one mechanic that I'd fault in this game is that the amount of time you'll spend recalculating dominance over hexes slows the game down considerably. A good fun game otherwise.

Caylus meets El Grande with a twist.

Main issue is some cards are too powerful, most of the time there is a race for the domination row to catch the best cards of the current turn. Thankfuly we played for the first time a 3 players game, it seems that more than 4 can be a total chaos. I don't like games in which cards can give one so much and others almost nothing. One card gave 16 VP in one puntuation, that was too much powerful.

I expected a little more from this game. It's only OK for too much time spent.

*update*

I played with 5 players and I also liked it. I don't think it's a great game, but it's very good one and it's fun.

First game was with 2 players with 2 species each.  Rules are not difficult but there is a alot of chaos.

RATING: 7
An area control & worker placement game with bite (nastiness).  The worker placement mechanism in this game is similar to the Age of Empires III board game, which I like.  At times Dominant Species is very intense, but ultimately I think it may be too luck-heavy and chaotic for my liking and for the length of the game (3-4h).

The element (food) chits are drawn from a bag (chit pull), and they can be heavily skewed; Your primary food type might come out all at once or it might not appear for 3-4 turns in a row.  The cards (which are received for having dominance) tend to cause lots of chaos.  In fact, some cards seem to be too powerful.

You really need to focus on the element (food) discs when your permanent food comes out or you'll get hurt by the wasteland and decimation actions.  You may need to stall (and not produce your cubes/species on the board) because your permanent food type is not getting drawn from the bag.  In this case, at least you can score some points from land tile placement (via glaciation or wanderlust) while you await better times (food) for your species.

Immense FUN.  It is like the most intense game of Age of Empires III I have ever played, combined with the most intense game of El Grande that I have ever played, ROLLED INTO ONE AWESOME GAME!

I really like it!

I really enjoyed this one, playing with 3 players each controlling 2 animals. For quite a deep game, it has an  easy to understand ruleset. The complexity comes in how all the moving parts come together - there all lots of potential actions and things going on all over the board. This leaves a deliciously painful set of dilemmas as there are always more things that you want to do and in more places than you have actions for. It can be quite brutal if you get screwed by the other players, and some of the cards are very powerful if you get them at the right time (although you know what's coming up in the turn to compete for). Can't wait for next time...

Wowowow my favourite game ever!

Dominant Species is a worker placement game with the Species Evolution theme pasted on. I don't know about you, but I feel the theme is more present than I expected.

So, you are an animal species trying to survive the Ice Age, by adapting to the ever-changing environment, fighting with other species, migrating to places where your species can flourish, etc

The worker placement engine is great. The order of events make sense and it create a brainfreezing challenge (and that's the only problem with the game... it is AP prone) for the players.

It's a GMT game with very good components. The artwork is simple "a la GMT style". Nothing astonishing, but quite clear and simple looking.

The variety of strategies is amazing and each animal has a special power. Everygame looks different than the previous one.

The way the board evolves during the game, makes you feel that the world is really changing. And with that all the struggles that comes with it with our species.

Great great game! It's heavy, but I don't think it's that hard to get into. Not for AP prone players (it can really be a bad experience for them and other players)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Dominant Species is making a fantastic first impression.  It's a game of constant aggression and success to you needs to come at the cost of the other people playing.  The systems mesh perfectly and the time spent (over 7 years in development from what I understand!) shows with the smoothness of play and the way that all of the systems work together to create an ebb and flow that one would expect from the evolutionary theme.  I love the fact that this game has the "pebble in the pond" effect down perfectly.  Decisions made have impacts that you may not be aware of until much later.  Amazing game!

My initial impressions based on my first two two-player games is very positive.  I think that this game is going to be a big hit with my group!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Dominant Species offers a variety of strategies and options, that are balanced well. High player interaction, deep tactical decisions and variety of options with excellent balance between animals and strategies make this an outstandig strategy game. The theme is well integrated into the game, because it feels like a game of survival and starvation, with new species quickly appearing and disappearing. DS manages to integrate powerful instant-effect or permanent-effect cards into the game without being broken. You're often offered two or three strong options.
The conflict for Action Spaces is high. Additionally you often want to take 6 actions desperately so always have tough choices to make.

The problems it has are that an annoying part of tactics is correctly counting and memorizing cubes and additionally taking the cards into account. This is somewhat unsatisfying.

The scoring mechanic isn't too intuitive, because "Dominate" vs "Dominance" is confusing.

The only unfair mechanic seems to be Survival Scoring since only 1 player is rewarded, which can be harsh.

Overall an extremely good game.

RATING: 9
I try not to buy games on impulse anymore. But when I first read about this I was fascinated by the theme and the mechanics. It reminded me a bit of "Revolution: The Dutch Revolt" with its multi-phasic and interwoven structure; but here, each player will only be able to participate in a limited number of the actions (phases). I expect that the "action draft" here will be a brain burner (experience may well modify that - the question is to what extent). At first blush however, this sounds delicious!

I'm not usually a big fan of chaos, but as a war gamer I can tolerate some ("Warriors of God" is at the upper end of my tolerance level - "Settlers of Catan" is way beyond it). This appears to have a fair dose of it which has been remarked upon quite negatively by some. This could be the kicker but I'll have to try it on for size. It really depends on the game and how all the moving parts come together and the impact the chaos has on the arc of game play.

In any event, when the game was up for reprint I jumped all over it. I now anxiously await an opportunity to get it on the table. The initial rating is simply anticipatory - I hope and expect it to go up...
++++++
Got the game on the table and my heavens it is a brain burner! This is going to take some playing into. Every action you take ripples down the action tracking board, and on the playing field, and "dominance" calculations have to be re-assessed constantly. We found it engrossing but long. Some folks are not going to be happy with the calculation heavy nature of this game - and beware if you have folks in your group who are either prone to AP or who relish mini-maxing calculations to the last decimal! It was very interesting to play but I'll need to play a lot more before deciding where to place this game. Still, one of the more truly innovative designs that I have seen in some time!

Ed Note: Couple of plays in now and a couple on the iOS app. I'm totally convinced this is a top shelf game, but some of the earlier reservations remain. The game invites more players rather than fewer but that means long game times. One idea I'm toying with is to clear the board of cards during reset to limit the game to six turns.

Finally got to play this again and raised my rating. Plan enough time, 3 to 4 hours plus almost 1 hour to explain it to new players.
But the game is worth the time investement, if you can take a complex game that can be quite unfair. The balance comes from players understanding the positions of the others and bashing on the leaders.
I would not recomment to play this with people prone to AP.

RATING: 7
Provisional rating - I need to play more.

First feel is very positive, theme fits the mechanics and you feel engaged the whole game, and you don't have to keep checking the rules.

Not a game for someone with AP! and I'm not sure I'd want to play with more than 4, just for the game length (unless all were fast players).

I like it - definitely a hybrid, there is conflict here, you can really mess with other players directly and indirectly. Seems to scale ok too with the number of players.

I like the random chit pull for the 'enviroment', but I like the way the chits move down, so you have some control and some prior warning of problems coming up.

Feels a bit like Age of Empires III mixed with TyranoEx.

** Update, definitely flavour of the month - playing this every week :) There is a nice mix of strategy and tactics - yes you have to optimise your actions each turn and react to what others are doing, which cards are available this turn and what element disks are where - but you can also have an overarching strategy you try to follow and I like the simple way each animal plays differently. Rating increased 

** Update, now played it with more - and it is a different beast, but I like it. You can't play each animal the same - and being later in the turn order makes it very unlikely you'll move up unless animals going before you prioritise something else. Not that going last is a disaster, food chain to break ties is a help, it just means you have to take a different approach

*** Update - shine off a little bit, mostly time taken to play, plus I think I prefer Age of Empires for the action placement mechanic.

Apparently its a time sink- so be it:) Not all in life is quick quick.

3-4 is the sweet spot?!?

This game was a pleasant surprise.  This morning I got to work through a few rounds and tried a couple of different species.

It reminded me of Age of Empires in the sense of a worker placement.  There is interaction though that somewhat reminded me of Axis and Allies.

What I really enjoy is the sense of clawing for survival.  I think with two many AP players though the game could bog down so with higher numbers I can see me putting out an hour glass.

I think the components are great and for me it all just works.  It was easier than Age of Empires in the sense that all the actions come as a result of the placement of action pawns. So much of the game is all about population manipulation and then timing placements of cubes/species to ride along for a scoring op.

Fun!!

How can a game look so unappealing on the board, full of cubes, cones, and hexes, yet provide such an engaging, strategic, and [i]thematic[/i] experience.  Simple, make each turn tell a story.  Food sources die out, forcing species to evolve; the ice age expands, forcing species to find new land and procreate.  At the end of the game, as the glaciers become the dominant landmass, the game turns into not running away, but living, fighting, and dying on the new harsh landscape.  The species that adapts/survives the best wins.  All with cubes and cones.

One hell of an area control game and I think it's an impressive design.  But my feelings on it have declined since my first play almost 5 years ago.  Mainly it's tough to get to the table.  The rules aren't all that complex but the game is quite heavy so the first game(s) feels like you're just along for the ride.  So you need to get multiple plays of this with the same group to appreciate it.  But that's tough because this is also a long game.  The theme comes through more than you might expect but it's still pretty abstract.  The main mechanism of the game has a programming feel- you select actions worker placement style, then after everything is selected the actions are executed.  It's very cool, but despite your planning things will go haywire as your plans clash with your opponents' in unpredictable ways.  And that's all fine too but in a game this long and heavy I wish it felt a little more controlled and less swingy.  Overall, I think there are better games that give a similar feel in less time and with less complexity.

Maybe a little too heavy for the Spiel des Jahres, but all my money says it's the best bet for the Deutsch Spiel Preis. To those who complain about the length, I say : "The longer the better! Savor the length, prolong the pleasure!" (OMG! Did that comes across so porny? Ahh, as Gordon Gekko says, "It's better than sex!")

P/S - It's so good that I made a little "expansion" for 7 players, check out my thread on that.

The best Evolution themed game, ever. IMHO American Megafauna is more educational BUT less playable.

Un juego de evolución prehistórica, con una mecánica de colocación de trabajadores similar al Age of Empires III. El tablero consta de una serie de losetas sobre las que los jugadores van colocando sus especies.. las losetas se pueden evaluar (va por mayorías).. y cuando eso sucede, se distribuyen puntos entre los presentes, y se adjudica una carta a aquél que tena la dominancia (esté más favorecido por los recursos disponibles en la loseta).

El tablero es modular a base de hexágonos.. y en los vértices de los hexágonos se ubican los recursos de los cuales se "alimentan" los especies. 

Es un juego bastante estratégico. Duración media - larga (3-4 horas), pero muy absorvente. Altamente recomendable. Es un gran juego, aunque me parece caro para la calidad de los componentes y el diseño (muy pobre).

What a fantastic game.
High on strategy and chaos. A bit of the struggle you might think existed among the species in those days.
Chaos is a core essence in the game, that make you always be on your toes on what may happen.
The cards also make a good addition to the game as you must play them.

Time really flies when you play this gem of a game.

RATING: 9
Mean, cutthroat, mean, in-your-face, mean, lots of direct conflict, mean, your friends will hate you...did I mention this game is mean? It's also got a bit of a learning curve. My first few disastrous turns left me feeling very sink or swim-my... but a great game with TONS of player interaction... the leader (or contenders for first) will take the brunt of the mean stuff the players are dishing out, but if it weren't so someone would just run away with the lead.

Lots of stuff going on here but it works really well with the theme, and the core mechanics of the game are awesomely put together. A+

RATING: 7
Very interesting mix between euro (majorities) and aggressive gameplay.
Theme seems to be really well represented in the mechanisms.
However, it is simply too long for my taste, and the last rounds seemed to drag a little (we missed the game ending card by one and had to play another round and I was out of contention).

UPDATE: 6.5 -> 7. Much better with 4 than with 6. Leaving out several cards (those that give extra actions) as suggested by the author makes the game length more agreeable for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is one of the most unpleasant experiences I've had from a game.
It more or less defines everything I don't like about 
heavier euros - too many choices, with no basis in reality
helping to direct them.

Pity. I love the concept of evolution games, and not
one has gotten it 'right' yet. DS though manages to put
all others to shame. It may be a fine game for people who
love nothing better than to count and recount all the time.
But, that's just too much effort for me. I'd far prefer
just working on a spreadsheet and making my decision once.

Another solid Euro played due to my top-100-BGG-challenge. This is one I feel would more easily go up on a replay than some other games I've played in the top-100 that land at a 6.5-7 score. There really were core mechanics I didn't grok onto until 2/3 of the way into the game. Lots of player interaction with multiple paths to winning, and I can see the some of the fiddly scoring rules not being nearly as troublesome on another play or two. Definitely would play again, hopefully coming in at 2 hours or less. If we could get a good game within this time, this could be an 8.

The only problem that I see is the game length. Even though it is always the same, it keeps me focused for the whole game (for me 4 hrs focused is a lot!!). For 2 it is OK, but I would not recommend it unless you do not have any other choice. I guess the optimum will be 4-5 players. I would never play this game with casual gamers or gamers suffering from A-P. When I try it with 4-5 players could go up to a 9.

Juego que mezcla mayorías con selección de acciones (similar a caylus o age of empires III en este punto), muy muy profundo, con unas 4 horas de duración (un poco menos quizá), con un temá bastante entretenido: la evolución de una clase de animal (reptil, arácnido etc) en una etapa previa a la glaciación.

Cada clase  de animal tiene unas características, y hay cartas que permiten obtener ventajas (con un gran peso en la partida y puntuación).

Gran juego, que ganaría mucho con unas ilustraciones un poco más vistosas.

RATING: 10
Brilliant.  The scientific, evolutionary theme works incredibly well with the boards, bits, and actions.  I completely forgot about the pieces and fell into the game.  There are so many action choices that it mirrors the chaos of the natural world beautifully.  Can't wait to get this and play it with my wife (one of the few games I had to buy immediately after playing once).  Only downside is the potential for significant Analysis Paralysis.

Update: This game rarely hits the table due to its length and complexity, but it is an absolute fabulous game. Has withstood time and limited plays to maintain its ranking. Always want to play.

a great brain burner. multiple paths to victory and a flow that matches the theme well (lose parts of the world as the tundra spreads, but the hardy species that can survive on the tundra can gain a lot of vp). having to figure out how the turn will unfold when placing the action tokens can send ap prone players into paralysis.

I was very impressed after my first play, and successive plays have reinforced that feeling, which is hardly suprising considering it combines elements of El Grande & Caylus, two games I love. Rules are very intuitive and thematic, and the rulebook is a wonder to behold. As for the artwork, I think it is great: I love its abstract-like simplicity. This game hits all the right buttons for me and is my favorite game published in 2010.

RATING: 8
There are so many decisions that the game takes quite a long time to play. Very enjoyable choices, but the chaos of the final turn scoring was somewhat off-putting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple to explain....just 30 minutes. But a whole lot of 'think' behind playing the game. It's El Grande on steroids, throwing in worker placement and a double area majority control (species presence and element matching). Our first game took 4.5 hours which is a bit long. However, the game play is tense and entirely engaging.

The cards are a bit chaotic. The swings are rather large with some devastating cards depending on which round it appears (Blight + Catastrophe + Ecodiversity + Biodiversity). We will try with the variant of not including the cards.

Not sure which came first (the chicken or the egg) but the theme is original and integrated, in otherwise what could have been a mechanically detached euro.

Update: after four plays, it is more apparent that the cards are not as chaotic and swingy as first thought. The biggest knock against the game is the random factor of elements that get drawn. The only other knock is the computing of dominance which gets a bit tedious.

The play time with 4 players is under 3 hours.  With the right group and a few plays under your belt, this can be down to 2.5 hours. And I'm really digging the theme. Lurve it.

The game is not noob friendly. They find it too swingy, chaotic and devastating. And yet, I don't find that at all after several plays. The most frustrating aspect is when the elements you need don't appear.

Update #2- I would really like to rate this game a 9 or a 9.5, but the random elements really prevent this from ascending to higher greatness. If your core elements don't come out, then you're really behind the 8-ball.

Update #3: Dropped rating from 8.5 down to 8. The game has lost some of its lustre. Playing with experienced players now. The random draw of elements nearly break the game.

RATING: 7
Interesting theme and solid mechanics to back it up. Components and rules are superb and make the game easy to approach.

The game lasts long and 180 minutes is optimistic even for 4 players. There's also a significant chance for any AP prone players to freeze completely at some stage of the game.

RATING: 5.2
Mixed feelings about this one which balance out to an average gaming experience. Brilliant ingenious systems, concept and design but weighed down by some typical heavyweight Euro issues: AP, swathes of cubes/cones to push around, significant downtime and the biggest issue being the potential for kingmaking and other players laying waste to your plans/playing counter intuitively thru no fault of their own even, just because they can. It just doesn't feel like you having fun with creatures and fighting for survival like the cover or theme would suggest. They could have also done more with the combat to increase the flavor in this regard.

Wow! Just finished our first game and it was a blast. We missed a few rules in the beginning, and it took us a few turns to understand what was going on, but our next game should be much more focused. I'm looking forward to it!

Second game. I lost by more than 100 points... A disaster! I let go too many important domination cards and glaciation phases. I still had a lot of fun :)

After 8 plays.
It's not being played a lot, but it's good every time it gets to the table. It's just that Twilight Struggle is our game of choice for a longer 2-player game.

I LOVE this game. Nice unused theme with very simple but beautiful artwork.
It's a true wargame that disguises as a worker placement euro. And it does that so well...that you won't notice it until you loose these 2 tiles in one turn to a bird 2 tiles away, that removed your ressources and killed the remaining units in combat.

A fantastic game, deeply strategic, with very little luck in the pot.

I also like the theme.  The most impressive part though to me is the cleanness of the game's design.  The rules are straightforward, the board contains all of the info you need to know, and the cards are for the mostpart concise.

Not a game I'd play all that often due to length, but a good game.  Initial rating 9.

Sep 2011:  Rating down to an 8.  For some reason I have almost no desire to play this, even though I really quite liked it.  Not sure why.  But, I don't think it's a 9 anymore!

RATING: 9
Fascinating, immersive, at times completely chaotic -- and yet you know EXACTLY how you got where you are.  One moment everyone's in Happyland with plenty to eat and everything they desire; the next they're looking at total devastation and wondering how they're going to get through the next turn.  Die Macher with animals is an accurate description, but a heck of a lot easier to "sell" to players.  A long game that doesn't FEEL long. With more play, this could become a 9. 

Brilliant design feature: the action chart on the board that condenses most of the (fairly complex) rules and makes what could have been a difficult game easy to pick up, even for players used to lighter fare.  And while the graphic design at first looks underwhelming, it suits the game perfectly.

Update: After teaching this game several times, I finally got to play it a second time.  Two-player game (without the optional rules), I got an early advantage, and against all odds, my opponent could NOT turn it around.  In a four-hour game (which ended after 1 am), that could have been misery -- and yet not only did we both enjoy the game, we sat up for a good half hour afterwards dissecting it.  THAT is a good game.  I don't have a lot of 9s, but one more game like this, and this one's joining the ranks.

Update Two: I've played several games now, and it just gets better, even when I get destroyed. 9 it is.

RATING: 8
This has been the most played game from the Essen 2010 purchases.  And for a 4 hour game this is truly incredible.  One of the finest games ever to have entered my collection.

Since writing the above I have since played with the recommended four cards removed and find it an even better game.  Firstly it reduces the playing time to a more acceptable limit without giving any feeling that the game has been shortened.  What is more, removing cards that gave some players more action points than others would be a recommendation in itself because such cards unbalance an otherwise superb game and would have been better omitted from the outset; so nothing lost there

FURTHER THOUGHTS:  Unfortunately not such a good game (overall) as I originally thought.   The game mechanic is truly excellent but the game is spoiled by the incredible imbalance of the Event Cards.  This is a 3+ hours highly tactical game but a player can be put right out of it near the end, thereby giving no time to recover, by the fall of certain of these cards.  This is totally unacceptable in a game of this complexity and length.  Yet alongside these devastating cards there are others that are extremely mild in their effect.   It is no surprise that a player falling victim to these  damaging cards after 3 hours of mental slog never wants to play it again.

Lo reconozco, es un gran juego, pero no es mi tipo. Demasiado largo y demasiado caos que me hace pensar si quiero estar 3 horas o más jugando. El tema encaja pero en mi opinión las cartas son demasiado decisivas y el king-making hace su aparición en casi todas las partidas (por lo menos a 5/6 jugadores que es lo único que he probado). Normalmente no me negaré a una partida pero es uno de los pocos juegos que consigue freirme el cerebro.

I love this game, but it burns... bad!  I know many people who are very much undecided about this game.  Then again, they tend to play it with 4-6, and I've only played it with 2.  With 2, it's plenty hard enough (I think I've won once).  Unlike most 2 player area control games, this one is actually good, because you have to manage two types of control simultaneously.  This doubling is the games main innovation imo, and worth getting the game for even if it doesn't come out too often.  Unlike many similar games, it is possible to come from behind, but managing the short and long games is very hard to do.  Don't underestimate the Survival card - letting someone hold it for a few turns can be devastating, especially if they are spread out thin.  Honestly, no game in recent memory gets my blood up like this one does.  It does have plenty of chaos even with 2 (mostly in the form of the random element draws), so if you are skeptical of this one, play first with 2 or 3.  Fun, but long (expect 2-2.5 hours with 2) and HARD.  A design I greatly admire.

I watched several BGG review videos of this game, thought it looked so fun and complex, heard from so many people how awesome it was, and was excited to finally get this as a gift. 

On our first two-player game, I found myself annoyed at having to CONSTANTLY recalculate dominance for every hex,  frustrated at how long each turn was taking, and generally moaned and groaned for the greater part of two hours. Yes, we ended the game early because no one was having fun. I hope that we'll have a better go at it next time, but it was unfortunately not a good first experience. Too bad, because the third printing is beautiful.

A Euro that's better than the European Euros. The gameplay matches the theme perfectly. Super deep game with a lot of decisions for present and future.  Optimally 4-6 players is the way to go.  I highly recommend a couple practice rounds to learn the terminology on the board.  This is a serious strategy game that requires thoughtful play but worth the effort. Each turn is an adjustment to the other species play which fits perfectly to the theme. You can set up tricks and traps when you get really comfortable with the mechanism. This is a flat out winner for sure. Warning, this is a heavy game that can be a real brain burner.

Played first game with others who were playing for 1st or 2nd time.  Game seemed a long for what it was.  After 2-1/2 hrs, I was wanting the ice age card to show itself so we could end the game. Maybe with another play or two, I would like it more (because I really want to like this game).

UPDATE: I played this again for the second time.  I had a better grasp on the rules, but I had absolutely no idea about how to do well in the game, or even what strategies to use.  I even was in the lead for the first half of the game.  About hour 2.5, I was wishing for this ordeal to be over, but I hung in there and played as best I could.  We ended at hour 4, and me in dead last.  I really wanted to like this game, but I cannot get my head around it.  Will not play again.

UPDATE 2: Have decided that I will learn to play and understand this game, because I really want to like the game.  It's a favorite in the group, so it getting some table time at game days.

First play was 4p and took about 5.5 hours. A bit long but it was still fun. Controllable chaos and interesting interactive play. As people get more accustomed to the cards, there's less "randomness" that cannot be accounted for. Playtime is likely to go down as well. 

Some discussion was had as to the various animal powers but I think so far that they are interesting and not necessarily too under/overpowered yet.

Monkey man I love to procrastinate! Lalala in the the bowels of the ice cream flavored tree roost lay an acorn longing for an animated character named Ranma to take it away to the Southern seas. Only then could the little acorn find it destiny. Stamp collecting. But first pox is a disease that needs reconciling! Gathering its hat and little round body, the acorn rolled away but to its dismay, fell into quicksand. Oh but the little acorn was so little, it did not sink, just floated like a cloud on a cloudless day. Along came a squirrel. "Oooo an acorn" it chittered "I want it for my very own eating!" The squirrel hopped into the quicksand and began to munch. Oh but then he started to sink, dragging down the acorn to its watery grave. At least the squirrel grabbed a vine and scuttled away but alas, it was too late to save half eaten acky :(

To my mind the best area control game there is and the theme fits perfectly. The game immediately puts you at odds with the other players as each of you attampts the grab the most fertile areas, or do ou become a galcier specialist? The domination cards are powerful and can devastate opponents, and whilst this could be seen as 'swingey' it's up to you to get into the best position to get to the cards first. One of my favourites

Awesome game!  A little odd in that it feels like it's supposed to be a heavy strategy game, but the amount of chaos ends up putting it more on the tactical side of things.  There can be a small amount of planning ahead, but you're pretty much riding the waves.  Nevertheless, I have a lot of fun playing it!

The game basically boils down to a worker placement/area majority game, where your worker placements allow you to tailor the world to your liking, adapt your species for higher survivability, and add more of your species to the world.

There are two kinds of things you're fighting for.  One is simply having the most guys on a tile, which allows you to score points throughout the game.  The second part is having the best match to the environment on each tile, which gives you "dominance" of that tile, regardless of how many guys you have on the tile.  Dominance allows you to take advantage of dominance cards, which have rather powerful effects!  Dominance also will score you a potential boatload of points at the game end.

Overall, a very cool game that's actually rather straight-forward despite the initial glut of choices you're presented with.  A few turns in and you'll be rolling along just fine though.

Dominant Species is an epic game. It takes hours.  It is hard.  It is tense, and I mean brow-sweat-inducing.  And -- as any game about classes of animals struggling for survival in the face of an impending ice age should be -- it is ruthlessly interactive. Those are the games [u]virtues[/u]. 

From a design standpoint, the game is one of those rare, obvious-in-hindsight innovations.  Stripped bare, [person=6331]Chad Jensen[/person] essentially replaced the cards in card-driven games with a worker placement-driven system of action selection.  In doing so, he not only exponentially expanded the options available with each action -- resulting in greater control, and richer gameplay – but also he produced one of the most natural and intuitive uses of worker placement on the market.  

Here, worker placement drives the action, but does not draw attention to itself.  It is the crank that winds the music box, not the music.  To this task it seems ideally suited.  Indeed, something about its implementation here satisfies both my enjoyment of worker placement and my love for programming games (such as [thing=38453]Space Alert[/thing]).  Moreover, the menu of actions from which players select is arranged as a logical hierarchy (with choices at the top requiring only a fraction of the gut-wrenching mental energy of choices at the bottom) that effectively provides a built-in tutorial for the accompanying board play.  The angst of action selection also allows players to really identify with their species’ standing in the world (whether desperately needing to flee to parts unknown or ruthlessly exploiting a position of momentary dominance).  The result is a special kind of thematic immersion. 

From an experience standpoint, I can’t help but link Dominant Species to [thing=12333]Twilight Struggle[/thing], though I’ve heard comparisons range from [thing=25613]Through the Ages [/thing](with a map!) to [thing=93]El Grande[/thing], The Director’s Cut.  Both Dominant Species and Twilight Struggle are incredibly satisfying to play because of their slowly developing narrative arc.  I’ve encountered few games that can simply allow a compelling story to unfold through good play.  Although both are long, neither seems to outstay its welcome.  Both produce precisely the kind of atmosphere that I enjoy most: palpable tension.  In both, that tension is manifested in a struggle for survival that is appropriately thematic for each, and that I find just engaging.  Lastly, each game has a large number of strategic options that are all sufficiently interconnected to allow for maximum flexibility in response to randomized elements. Neither is a game that asks you to commit to one of a few well-defined strategies, with just a little flexibility at the margins (I’m looking at you, [thing=35677]Le Havre[/thing]).  Instead, both games seem to be about carving out a unique path in a seemingly unconstrained strategy space by layering small decision upon small decision.

I can’t say enough good things.  I love that it provides the ability to force other players into a decision between benefiting you with their actions or depriving themselves, whether through secondary and tertiary majorities, or through adaption and dominance.  I love that the random and unequal dominance cards incentivize short-term goals –- often, just avoiding the havoc another player is soon to wreak -- that are otherwise in tension with ideal long-term planning.  I love that players can control the rate at which species enter the board, providing a Euro-like resource management throttle that is particularly effective because of the game’s length.  

For our learning game (with 5 players) we randomly removed 10 of the cards from the deck. It didn't seem to have a negative effect on the game's balance (we kept the Amphibians out).  But the resulting game, though still fun, was less epic than it should have been. I wouldn't play that way on a regular basis (I would compare it to Le Havre's short game, which I've come to enjoy less and less over time).  We all agreed that the game would be much better at full length with additional strategies to develop and a wider variety of actions to take.  Additionally, the game is so gripping that it's hard for me to ever view additional length as a negative.  We all lamented seeing the Ice Age card come out, even after 3 hours.  It's a bit like having the SuperBowl go into double overtime -- no one is mad that they have to watch [i]more[/i] great football.

There are already a lot of threads on the artwork and components, so I’ll just briefly mention that I really, genuinely like the aesthetic of the game.  I dig the clean, simple, and understated look, and it was a [i]selling point[/i] of the game for me.  I also tend to think that (1) too many games are made worse by their attempts at art, and (2) the increasing emphasis on game appearance is eroding the appreciation for a strong link between mechanics and theme (replaced by an appreciation for a strong link between artwork and theme). 

To the extent that anyone is worried about this, I can attest that the game looks professionally produced in person. No one will laugh at you at game night for bringing a homemade game (and this is coming from someone who owns several small publisher games that he won't bring to game night for fear of being laughed at :blush: ). The photos here are accurate with respect to the colors and artwork, but the components certainly do not look cheap on the table.

Other than [thread=538033]Cavum[/thread], which eventually became my idiosyncratic 10 (we all have one, don’t we?), no game has jumped so quickly to the top of my personal rankings.  I hope I can get it to the table with much more frequency going forward, as right now it’s really the only game I want to play (it may have even ruined Essen for me).  Dominant Species is a special game.  It’s certainly not right for those whose ideal game is a 60-90 minute straightforward Euro with predictable mechanics, streamlined gameplay, and animeeples.  It is long, complex, tense, and confrontational.  Because of all that, it is also ultimately rewarding in a way that few games can manage.

Very good game but:
A little bit too long, and a too chaotic. May be a little bit to complex as well, so many things to keep track of...
Also to many things happen in the last turn, it's really hard to keep control.

Otherwise, very cool mechanics, nice interactions (too much? -> chaos issue), good theme. I like the light power of each races. 

Rating could go higher or lower depending on if the next plays prove the game to be not that chaotic and not even longer (3,5 hours for the first game (5 players)).

Update 30/11/10:
Second game last 5 hours! (4 players) Their was still some chaos, but more control as well

Long game + interaction give a very nice "epic" feeling to the game

I love who everything is interconnected. All the possible actions are all inter-related, making the potential combinations of actions you can take huge. Actions X, Y, Z will combine to create huge effect A, or you could take actions P, Q, R to make huge effect B, and the list goes on.

This game melted my brain. Seriously, I have to take a break half way through to stretch my legs and eat. Especially eat, I burned up a lot of energy playing this game.

The sheer power of some moves was impressive to witness. Often times this is the Dominance cards (like Catastrophe), but sometimes it's an impressive move like a double Wanderlust for 13 points and two territories that only you can enter. Or a well-timed and well-placed Glaciation.

It includes moves for a short-term goals, but also for long-term goals, particularly the goal of being well-placed for the final turn, because coming back on the last turn is definitely possible as long as you've set yourself up for it.

Which is one of the game's two biggest flaws. The last turn is too important, things can happen in the last turn that can make the rest if the game seem irrelevant.

The other huge flaw is just how complicated thus game is. There are so many concepts that need to be learnt before you can even start playing. Not an easy game to get to the table. The length doesn't help either.

While I love the look of this game, I want to draw particular attention to the ebb and flow of the two-player game. The Dominance markers flow back and forth across the land like a rising and falling tide during the game. It is very aesthetically pleasing to watch.

Some people like purely tactical games that take 1+ hour per player...I just don't.  There is not enough time in life to play a game like this.  I need a game with some sort of arc.  I hate games that are long and include one or many of the following things:

1. A player can be eliminated from the start by some conniving player.
2. A person who has no chance of winning decides the fate of the other players (kingmaker).
3. You have effectively no expectations of what other players are doing because there is no strategy.
4. Games that feed AP instead of introducing mechanics to defeat it.
5. Games where the person who has the least done to them wins.

This game has parts of all 5 of these. And I'm sorry, but the worker placement game is neither new or interesting, especially when you have 1 action that is far and away better than the others that will, due to needing another action to change turn order, go more often to a single player at the table.  The cards are so imbalanced and random, that they decide the game, and they are only marginally associated with an AP placement!  Of course, the rest of the table will counteract a high score by bashing that player to smithereens...so maybe you should turtle and hope to win in final scoring...wait, how is this fun again?  Not to mention, the pieces just make this a fiddly mess.

If you like shitty games like El Grande, Eclipse, and Age of Steam, you will probably like this one...just strap in and watch the 4 hour snorefest that you have no control over.

  I've been eagerly awaiting this one for a while I got late in september but was able to teach and play a game with a friends copy.  I'm very happy with the depth and fun of this game.  It may need a bit of prodding as the game goes on to prevent AP from creeping in, but that said there wasn't to much of this in our first game.  I may recommend removing some cards and or shuffling the end game card into a pile (x# of cards where x=players) if you are teaching the game to new players or are pressed for time.  However if you have 2-3 hours and people that have played before then I highly highly recommend Dominant Species, if you don't have that much time then take the designers suggestion and play a different game.

  This game just gets better with every play.  I can't recommend this game enough.  Try to find a group of people that want to get into the deep strategies of this game and you may have found board game nirvana

It's really awesome, but only if you can deal with a long game.  Player interaction all over the place makes the fight for survival and points very engaging.  The downtime comes when trying to figure out dominance by continually counting up element matches, and also when trying to figure out your best move and counting and recounting your possibilities.  Neat game and fun theme.  I did start to lose interest in the middle of the game, but then as the end started to approach it got quite exciting.

A wild animal wargame of sorts.  The rules seem daunting, with so many actions to choose from, but are actually very easy to play after a round or two have been played.  The game is fairly attractive, but also heavy with little bits of wood.  Many opportunities for player conflict, but rarely can it be done without risk of retribution or exposing another flank.  In our games it's reserved for highly targeted tactical strikes, or very broad hurt everyone equally actions.  Game play can sometimes be a bit long, but even for AP players decisions are fairly easy to make.

[b]First edition copy with the improved tiles from the 2nd printing.[/b]

[i]NOTE: to responsibly shorten the game, remove the cards: Intelligence, Parasitism, Omnivore, and Immigrants[/i]

My first play of Dominant Species was easily the most excited I've felt after a game in a long time. It is also one of the few, rare games that justifies the approx. 4 hour playing time. I gotta imagine playing time gets better with familiarity, but there's so much to think about and the available actions are so many, that every game is going to take quite some time to get through.

What's to like? It's area control and worker placement... two things I like very much because it keeps everyone involved. Despite the "spartan" appearance of simple tiles and wooden cubes, this is also one of the most thematic games I've played in a while as well. It just goes to show that theme is not always in the "glitz" of components but is ideally reinforced by the game's actual mechanics. Dominant Species has theme in spades...

I had read a comment somewhere that asked essentially, "What does DS do that El Grande doesn't already?" There's an easy answer to that question in my mind: glaciation. The gradual creep of the glacier keeps everyone on their toes, forces tough choices, and generally provides an overall storyline to the game. It also shakes things up and provides opportunities (particularly via "survival") for someone to get back into the game. For so many moving parts, I'm shocked at how well everything fits together.

This is a wonderful game, and also possibly the heaviest game I own. I can only hope that I get to play this with some regularity. Based on the enthusiastic response it's getting from others, I think that might actually be possible.

There's only a few nitpicks with this game--I already mentioned the length, and for those prone to AP, the pacing of the game can really drag. Also, if an extra action pawn card pops up in the first row of the game, it gives the starting player an easy grab for a significant advantage that will last all game. The easy remedy for both is to eliminate a few cards from the deck and also ensure those extra pawn cards are not in the first batch.

Random comment: for 1st edition owners, the thicker tile set is worth it... slightly. They do make picking up elements and tiles much easier. It's probably not worth $20, but if you can get it cheaper, do it.

I really liked the game and even though it was long it didn't feel as long as it was. The biggest problem for me was that the element draws each round were random and very few seeds came out early in the game to help me as birds while my opponents had most of their other elements come out and were able to specialize rather quickly. For such a long game this randomness hurt the game for me a bit.

I also found tundra to be very important and probably want to focus on more in terms of getting the survival card each round, which is something I stayed away from in the first game. 

Really the only thing that bugged me about this game, and the primary reason for the rating, is the calculation for domination. While it makes sense, I found it very fiddly in the fact that it happened constantly throughout the game round as tokens were placed or species were moved around. I feel like if this would only happen at a specific point in the game, like everything else, it would speed up the game tremendously.

An epic game which is fun to play, but there are too many scoring conditions and the cards alter the game in ways that make all your work completely worthless. Hard to play a game for three hours and lose everything because someone happened to use a card that destroys everything you've developed.

RATING: 4
The end of game scoring showed that this game is more a luck-based than I prefer.

I played my first game, sucked royally and strived to keep my singletons on the tundra and inch along with Survival; it was a learning experience.  Instead, I leapfrog ahead at the end to come in third.

The leader (Insect) had about 30/40 species eliminated, was a veteran and wanted to end the game soon as he was not going to be able to come back.  Result: He leapfrogged far into the lead at the end game scoring.

So no, I don't think the playtesting managed to get a relevant scoring system into the game.  Too much last-second bonuses that minimize the gameplay during the game.

RATING: 7
Area control where points are being spit at you from every which way. Glaciation, wanderlust, domination, survival, certain dominance cards, and, in the end-game, dominance scoring and tile scoring. The profusion of points is, in some ways baffling, and in some ways makes the game work; there are always second, third, and fourth best options if things don't go as you planned. And they won't go as you planned because the player-induced chaos of the action pawn system is quite astounding.

What is left is a game that pushes you to make educated decisions about what people (including yourself) should do to score the most points, then manage to that goal, but be flexible. The grand bonanza of points at the end seems to force a more strategic approach than is would otherwise be required of the very tactical battle for round-to-round points. This mostly resolves a gripe that I have about games with such fine-grained scoring. [Note: I'm a soccer fan. I love the massive shifts of a game's texture based on a single score. Basketball bores me no end as it is a relentless drumbeat of relatively meaningless scoring increments. How can you get excited about a game where the best you can do at any point is the score 3% of your final score?]

Flexibility is not just necessary when all the pawns are down, however. As animals claim their spots, they are tipping their hand to what their plans are. One can then react accordingly and rejigger the hypothesis of round outcomes, always with an eye to folks that might impede a critical aspect of one's plan and another one to see if better (or other, perhaps smaller but non-exclusive) opporunities are surfacing.

A typical gripe I have with multi-player spatial control games is that success tends to depend on the perceptions of one's immediate neighbors (e.g. Antike). And, often, once committed spatially, your ability to change the dynamic is very limited. DS, by contrast, allows for a great deal of flexibility as you can speciate pretty much anywhere. Of course, you'll typically want to speciate around an element you have, but it certainly gives you flexibility to get in and out of positions.

I am very much on the fence about this game. On the one hand, it is outside of my comfort zone for length, for the sheer number of moving parts, and for the fineness of the scoring. On the other hand, I really appreciate what it does in creating a highly complex machine where anticipating your opponents is difficult, doable, and rewarding. It offers coattails to spot and ride, threats to make and follow-through on, threats to respond to - either preemptively or reactively - with a rich array of fight or flight tools, and generally a very good balance between managing the immediate, medium, and long-term threats and opportunities. In the end, it'll start at a 7 - better than Brass and Die Macher, but flawed with regard to my personal predilictions to land much higher.

RATING: 5
A fairly straight forward but surprisingly well detailed and designed action draughting game with a large but constant-length queue depth (unlike Caylus where the queue grows as more buildings come out).  Like all action draughting games (worker placement, a silly term), it is just an iterative trade-off between opportunity cost and prioritisation.  I find nothing inherently interesting there other than the implied negotiation (moves as offers) that comes along with most area-plurality games.  The decision spaces are a wee bit too long to be easily called tactical, but also far too short to be called strategic.  Figure 1.5-2 turns, with most sitting at the 1.5 end.  A game of layering small 1+ish turn vignettes.

In character this is an action draughting area-plurality game done as viewed by a classical wargam designer -- which is a rather charming combination.  The gross acceptance of randomness, which one assumes comes from the wargame franchise, is troubling.  The random Domination card draws are one thing, but much larger is the random chit pulls for elements.  Together they kill any ability for more than trivial forward planning and thus remove most of any interest I may have in the game -- which is not to say I had much to start with.  I could easily see value in a variant in which the elements and cards are pulled one round in advance (current turn plus next turn).  

In summary: A prettily rendered, well designed, tactical action draughting area-pluralty wargame with a deep constant queue that has few reasons for interest beyond charm, but it is unusually charming.  Currently rated at 6.0 (and edging onto 6.5).  Likely to fall to 5.5 as the charm wears off.

UPDATED RATING: 6.5. The charm is winning for now, but this is clearly a game which one fails to lose rather than a game one wins.

:coffee: My ongoing pained relationship with this title has a lot to do with the fact that I recognize the show-stopping brilliance of the design but have not, historically, had much fun actually playing the thing. I'm coming around a bit on the latter point -- DS is, if nothing else, a very well-designed abstract puzzle-game that hits notes I like with regard to a minimal role for dumb luck and a whole buttload of player interaction, and playing with four players as opposed to six took some of the chaos, ratcheting it down to "heavy brain burn" from "convoluted to the point of pain."

But in the end I keep thinking I'd rather play Agricola (etc.) if I want crunchy heavy worker placement and I'd rather play the COIN series games if I want Euro-influenced multi-player conflict simulation...

Complicated, but a lot of fun. Not sure I fully understand the best way to play it, but after only a small handful of plays I suppose that is to be expected. In our two or three games I've been trounced each time. Overall, a pretty unique worker placement game, though I'd prefer Caylus if given the choice.

I really wanted to like this. The theme really seemed like something that would appeal to me.

This game will certainly be a hit with certain folks. I find it an incredible brain burner but not in a fun way. the cards that are played as part of domination are nasty and it forces a "you better screw others before they screw you" mechanic which isn't very enjoyable.

I also found that end game scoring was too large a percentage of total scoring. it's the type of a game you need to play multiple times to really understand strategy and the larger picture. the reason this is so difficult is that the playtime is extremely long.

i would recommend buying the iOS game first to see if you like it.

I should have enjoyed this game, but I didn't find it too exciting. It's been too long, so I can't say why I was meh on it. I would be interested in playing again, but really I prefer Evolution for this kind of experience. Evolution is much faster, much simpler, and gives the same feel without the added area control considerations.

Too much fiddly accounting.  No clear objectives.  Just constant victory track scoring.  Boring.  A game themed on evolution: how about survival of the fittest? Unskilled players hose the game, which happens often since it is overly complicated. After two turns I didn't want to play anymore.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting design with an interesting (though non-narrative) theme.

At it's core, this is a swingy multi-tiered area control game, heavier on tactics and lighter on strategy but there is something about it that is so engrossing.  It may be how it blends the worker placement mechanism to influence the area control aspects.  It may be how the limited actions constrain your choices.  I think it is most likely trying to manage the ebb and flow of your progress in the game.  I enjoy games with strong timing aspects, and you must manage events to do well in Dominant Species.

This is one of the better worker placement games, although I'd rather remove the point scoring system. I like that dominance outdoes population during the game, but at the end the true winner should be the most prolific animal. Getting points is sort of a theme breaker for me. Still a great game as is though. Also, this game works best at three or four players. The initiative order is VERY important, and almost impossible for someone to move from space six to near the top over the course of the game with only one spot available. Especially because it allows you to select another option with the same pawn after performing initiative.

I enjoy the evolution-themed games that have preceded this one.  Dominant Species does a good job of tying the theme to the worker-placement engine. There are enough ways to score and strategize that I see a lot of replay value.

I'm curious whether the animals are all balanced, but the game is long enough that player interaction should overcome any small advantages. 

I look forward to more plays.

Likes: The elements mechanic; this isn't just a area control game with just whoever has the most pieces in an area scores best in that area, because the fact that animals have to also balance their spread with matching of elements make this a very interesting game. It is worker placement in a way, but the game doesn't focus on getting more workers like others in the genre; any extra workers have diminishing returns as some spots just aren't as strong and the game really only rewards a couple at most. Oh and the theme is awesome.

Dislikes: Game length can be a turn off for some. Also, the blue and green bits are close enough in color that one can get them confused in bad lighting.

On 2 January, 2014.

Dominant Species (3rd edition) was our pick for Christmas. I had high expectations towards the game and I really looked forward to get it.
My first impressions are really good. The game is great, plays well and it's fast. I have a similar feeling like in the case of Caylus as far as the rules are inherent part of the game. Everything works properly and oiled and I really like this. The rules are exceptionally easy to learn and teach. Dominant Species has an inherent logic that not only fits well to the theme but also is understandable and natural. Nothing feels forced or out-of-the-theme. Concerning the evolution and struggle of animal classes, the theme is cool and unique and feels great. It really gives an unique experience and doesn't feel pasted on. 
The quality of the components is over the top. I really like these wooden cones and cubes and all the others. The artwork on the cards is just amazing! Being my first game by GMT Games I really appreciate the effort they have taken to produce this game.

This is a game that I feel that I should like.  However, after most every play I am left asking myself "Exactly why did I play this again?"  Part of the difficulty (which is obviously not the "fault" of the game) is that I seem to play with new players all the time, so the game takes entirely too long to play.  

The luster for this game has worn off considerably.  Maybe I am a poor player (ok, probably I am a poor player), but the "disaster mitigation" factor in this game has left a very poor taste in my mouth.  I find myself no longer wanting to play this game.

Amazing simulation of how species have evolved in time. The mechanics are perfectly uniformed on ecologists concepts of the "Speciation" and "Domination", so you can really approach the game as you will probably do with the real study. It's quite complex manage all the things you can do to be the dominant one, but the rules are quite easy to understand and in few turns you have only to think about your best strategy to dominate. The game takes up to 4 hours (sometimes 5) to get to the end, after that it leaves you a nice sensation of an evolving world where different species have just rushed to survive better than the others one. It's enjoyable also in less players than six, so if you to have a play with a single friends in a face-to-face conflict, you can do it without lose the depth of the game system. Unfortunately, it is out of printing right now and it's really hard to find one out in every board game shops, but we hope that somene, sometimes will reprint it for us (maybe with some modifications inside in grafics and rules). Until then, the lucky that own the game, hope enjoy it with their friends!

This lasts too long and has too much luck (player-driven luck, but still functionally impossible to predict) for me to want to see it too much.

I wouldn't turn it down, but am unlikely to suggest it.

Egy játék után azt mondom:
- nagyon ütős, hogy minden mindennel összefügg
- nagyon elveszi a kedvem tőle, hogy minden kör első fele a stratégia kitalálásáról szól, a másik fele meg taktikázásról, ami teljesen átüti az addigi stratégiai gondolatmenetet. Sokszor azt éreztem, az akcióválasztásnál elég lenne véletlenszerűen (pl. kockadobással) felpakolni, a lényeg rész úgyis a taktikai, akcióvégrehajtásos résznél van.
- A másik ami unszimpatikus volt: a játék végi pontozás. 3 óra alatt kb. 80 pontot értem el, míg az utolsó végső pontozásnál ehhez még kaptam több, mint 100-at.......
- A száraz kinézet itt zavar, sokszor nem láttuk át mi micsoda (bár ez több játék után megszűnik szerintem). Ehhez képest az ára meg horribilis.
- Nem éreztem, hogy valóban kihaló fajok versenye lenne, szerintem csak megerőszakolták a témát... (pláne ott éreztem zavart, amikor az élőlényeimtől sok hexányi távolságra megszülethettek az ugyanolyan lényeim... ezek szerint volt teleportáció a jégkorszak előtt)

A negatív véleményem még úgyis fenn áll, hogy a 4 fős játszmában szoros csatában győztem végül.

Szóval hatalmas fantázia rejlik a játékban, de valahol félresiklott a dolog...

I find myself very often arguing with my friends about why this is the best game ever done. I fell in love with DS from the first time I saw the box, and it has never dissappointed me,  I love the brutally hard strategy, the lots of available actions, and the really deep relationship between strategy, mechanics and the Ice Age theme. I also love the fact that each different kind of animals has an apparently non significant ability, and that simple thing makes a huge difference in the strategy and possibilities for each one. This is just beautiful.

Update: 
10->9. Sorry Dominant Species, I only have room for one 10 boardgame rating, and Terra Mystica is now it. We're still friends, right?
------------
My 10 rating refers to exactly 4 players, and with the semi-official variant of not using the Domination cards that grant extra AP. Any deviation from that and the rating goes down.
-------------
Update after 6-8 plays:
Yeah, this is it. Rating -> 10. Yes, it's 4 hours, yes it has luck and lots of chaos, and even kingmaking (oh the horror). And yet it's my highest rated boardgame. The decisions are just that interesting, competition that tight, and overall that engaging. And fun! Each game can unfold in entirely new ways. In our last game we had a tundra front that essentially became impenetrable, with the other side getting virtually all of the new land tiles until that side of the board was completely full, and the majority of animal populations thus on the opposite side of the board of the tundra front (and open spaces). Amazing. The assymmetry of players and the randomness of the elements and cards guarantees a fresh game every time. But there are [i]enough[/i] random events that I don't feel the randomness overbears on a game, even at this length. And the random events are never specifically targeted at a single player, which I like. Thus it's not as directly impactful to individual players as say Die Macher. This is my first boardgame 10, joining my only other 10: Tichu.
--------
Wow. I've never had such a favorable impression of a game just from reading the rules. This game hits all the right buttons for me. I generally like worker placement, and this is no exception. I really like how your worker doesn't specify exactly what's going to happen (for almost all positions), so you can't really do all the calculations of what will happen. It does have a fair bit of "choose who you hose", but more often than not there's some impact to you, rather than being totally arbitrary. Thematically and mechanically it all comes together beautifully. For bonus points, downtime is extremely low.

RATING: 6
Putting Dominant Species on my want to play-list was a bit of a risky undertaking: it is a long game, and I had no idea whether I would like it or not. I knew only vaguely what it was about... only that it had shot up in the rankings and was spoken of very fondly by many.

After having played this beast, I think my attitude is on the warmer side of lukewarm. My main beef is that you do a lot on a rather small area of the board, making matters a tad fiddly; but far worse, you guesstiplanimate a lot of things in advance, then have to play somewhat reactively to adapt, and then a whole lot of controlled or semi-randomly controlled Bad News rolls over the playing area, shaking things up considerably in the process. That is in itself not so bad, but I think that this game could easily take an hour or so less, and still be satisfying. (I gather that there's an author-endorsed variant to remove the cards from play which would remove their swings of fortune as well as shorten the game.) In the end though, I was wondering what the long-term appeal of this game is supposed to be. It is rich in conflict, and the game clearly expects targetted extermination of species by the other species in order to prevent people from walking away with the game. That, in effect, turns DS into a game of pretending you're not in the lead, running away to hidey-holes, and then preparing for a big push near the end. Sound familiar? It should: It's called 'Power Grid'. This game is played in half the time, and follows exactly the same scheme, but then without conflict.

I find it interesting to speculate on the game's exceedingly high position on the ranking list. Spot #17 (at the time of writing) basically puts it at 'the best money can get'. I'm not sure that's warranted, really; and it cannot be denied that the game's origin (with a P750-scheme) gave it an extremely strong push forward: people pre-ordering a GMT game are not exactly run-of-the-mill customers. I think that, all things considered, DS should be ranked somewhat lower: it is, in the end, not a very diverse game, and does appear to contain much strategic variety.

I definitely think it was a good idea to try Dominant Species, and it was also definitely easy to get into despite its fearsome long play time. Once you've gone through a turn or two there is little which is unclear or needs to be referenced. But repeat plays... For now I'm curious how the shorter variant would play out; that would definitely help in getting this game to the table more often in the event I would be able to get hold of a copy. I'm going to be generous with my rate for the time being.

What's not to love? Excellent Design.

Everything is integrated and balanced (over the long game).

Scoring is simple. Based on tile type, majority, then ties broken by food chain order. 

Dominance is great, simple multiplication and addition. Do you score the tile where you're Dominant, but will score less points because there's a really awesome game changing card available? (most likely YES)

If you play with 2 players, definitely control 2 animal types each, for a total of 4 animal types in the game. Then each player will score their lowest for final scoring.

RATING: 3
Wow, grossly misleading rating of this game, Euro fan boys must drive those ratings, a Euroboy's wet dream. A truly overload game that gets bogged down via of second grade math drills, yes simply math, (x*y)+(w*z)+(..*..)+..., yada, yada, yada, over and over and over. You have to know your values and those of other players. 

Expect a play board aka the earth that you will stare at, a lot, like a deer in headlights, expect an AP board where you place your actions that you will stare at, like a deer in the headlights. Expect when taking the action more staring at the play board aka earth more deer in the headlights. You can expect a long play time

Does the above seem like a lot of repeat wordage? You got the feel of this game.

There is just too much bookkeeping to really be truely enjoyable. This is a game best played on a iPad where this burden is removed from the players.

It is somewhat an elegant game where the actions seem "nature", makes sense. The animals seem balance as does overall game play. There is some randomness of cards drawn, elements, tiles, but it is minimum. All information is visible, so very Euro in design rather than German, read where some labeled it American-trash, this isn't true. This thing is just an acquired tasted.

This game is missing some parts.
If you play this thing, buy 10mm or 8mm (same as cube size), dices, about 20 in each animal color, use these on the tiles as dominate count counters. You can then easly see the dominate count of each animal without having to remember or keep asking another player to do the math over and over or doing it in your head. 

This game to me is unplayable without this. These are values that drive the game, it is obscene to think that someone would enjoy needlessly recalculating this and this info isn't recorded on each occupied tile. This should help reduce the play time via of some of the 750-850 calculations and recalculations required to play it. Do not play this with 6 players, 4 would be the maximum.

You have been warned.

This game and Caverna are the reasons I stopped watching Dice Towers.

This game really does have it all - deep strategy, tension, integrated theme, attractive components...wow.  It's nearly perfect, and is truly a gamer's game.

I say NEARLY, because to me it's a bit too long for its own good.  I would love to see a variant that tightens the game up a bit - perhaps reducing the number of dominance cards based on the number of players.  At the current length it becomes easy to tune out while other players are locked in analysis paralysis.  We also have a small complaint about the cones - they look very cool, but are hard to pick up and move!  If this was consistently a 3 hour game and I could get a grip on those cones, it would be a perfect 10 to me.

That being said, this is a triumph for designer Chad Jensen, and especially to GMT, which picked a sleek minimalist look and an incredibly well-written set of rules.  Game of the year, indeed.

Thus far (two plays), this game appears to be exactly what I'd hoped it would be from reading the rules/reviews.[1] The play-length is nothing to sneeze at, but it's way shorter than (eg) Twilight Imperium or Age of Renaissance. The abstract presentation works well, though I wouldn't mind slightly more detailed /interesting terrain tile designs. My 5-player game wasn't as engaging as my 4-player game; I'm not sure how much of this was due to increased play-time and how much was due to intrinsic changes in the way the game plays with more people.

[1] = a strategic-and-tactical game with mostly-orthogonal competitions of "area control" (who has the [b]most presence[/b]) and "area fitness" (who is [b]best suited[/b]) taking place simultaneously, along with a strong scoring/advantage mechanism which rewards [b]both[/b] victors in a given area at the same time (though in different ways), plus dynamic board (for purposes of both competitions), dynamic fitness criteria for each player, and some other stuff which fits the theme nicely.

Not a bad worker-placement game.  I like the different species fighting for multiple scoring opportunities and the action decisions are numerous and, for the most part, important.  It runs a little long for what it offers and the randomness of some of the chit pulls can really hurt a given player, making it a little frustrating for some from time-to-time.  But it is a good game to get on the table with a 4-player group to have some fun.

This game, is what Age of Empire  should have been. As always, area majority is not one of my favorite mechanic, but that's only one of the mechanic. The other is worker placement which I love, and so many other little things. There are so many clever ways to play, so many little things to track by your brain. Experience will clearly helps you to guess/prevent/piggyback your opponent moves. Beautiful mechanism.

Unfortunately while the theme feels wonderful at first game, it becomes less recognized and more about mechanic. Since it's area majority, so mostly it's about move/remove pieces, and such. Opponents play WILL affect you, good or bad. Having said that, this game is really brain burning (a big plus for me!) and take quite long (doesn't matter for me). So while it's a good game, it's not for newbie for sure.

RATING: 7.5
I'd rate this game an 8, save for one misgiving - I worry that the endgame scoring is too big a portion of the final score.  If there were no random events, it would make more sense, gradually and strategically building your position up through the six turns.  However, with the 25+ Dominant cards affecting presence so extravagantly, there is perhaps too much chaos, playing too big a role, for the endgame scoring to have that much weight.

RATING: 10
This is an amazing game.  It does take a bit of time to get your head around, but once you get going it is actually quite easy to follow and teach.  It is deep, interesting, and there is always something going on.  I introduced 3 people who have only played light/gateway games (TTR, S/World, Dominion etc) and they love it.

RATING: 7
Obviously a solid game. The cards are a little too important, though. Some are very strong and some are not, so the first 5 actions taken tend to be the action that gives you points and cards (very strong action).
Game is still good, though.

RATING: 10
An absolutely epic worker placement/area control conflict game.  Totally engrossing start to finish, and way too much fun.  My wife is obsessed, we have played 4 games in less than a week and I am not complaining at all.

This game is really special in that while maintaining worker placement for action selection, player interaction is ramped up to 11.  Absolutely every move another player makes has dire repercussions and could spell gruesome loss for you and your animals.  

There is a lot to keep track of, but it all feels pretty natural (aside from overlooking the odd endangered species mid turn).  

Best with all 6, plays in less than 3hrs with experiencerd tables.

Only played it once (with three players), so consider this my first impressions. It's very well designed, but I'm not sure if it's fun. I was disappointed that a mammalian glaciation-focused strategy wasn't competitive. Game seems to come down to a race to grab and play certain game-changing event cards.

1st play with 5 players was extremely long at 5.5 hours and far too long waiting for my turn.  There were many times I did not play for 15 minutes at a stretch.  Perhaps some people would play quicker or maybe a 2 player game would be better.  It also suffers from the "pick on the leader" phenomena, which I never like in a game.  Finally, the game just has way to much to keep track of, which is why there is so much analysis paralysis in this game.

Amazing game, but doesn't get to the table often. Game is very long. It changes with every action, to the point that your plans are shattered (sha-doobie) so you have to be quick on your feet and able to mitigate the destruction of your strategy on every turn. Must have the right group.

Thoroughly engaging and immersive. Some of the cards can be over-powered, but in different ways depending on the game and who chooses them. While I appreciate the 'open information' (I'm looking at YOU Age of Empires III and the hidden natives), and the ability to 'count down' to the end game (which like Power Grid) can see huge lead and momentum swings, the chaos factor works both ways. It ensures replayability, but keeps it from being a true 9-10 for me (that and the 4-5 hour play time). Still a very good game that I currently look forward to each play.

The bottom line here is that, while it is a good game, its not worth the four hour investment.  The game itself is very well crafted and balanced.

RATING: 10
A heavy, long brainburner. Requires a few plays to fully appreciate. On first play it will seem extremely chaotic and unbalanced due to the cards. The key in this game is to plan carefully (because you have to assign all your action pawns before you see the results of your actions, which means you have to take lots of things into account) and check out the cards before planning your moves (their effects can be really powerful, so you really need to prepare for them). The game won't work if you just put your pawns here and there hoping for the best. This works with games that have less player interaction, but not in Dominant Species. I love this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think I've yet to play a game that churns my brain as hard as Dominant Species does. There is no hidden information. Every decision is calculable, even if most are prohibitively complex. The board is a delicate ecosystem that can tip in any direction at any moment. Players live in fear of what cards will emerge. Spiders out-think monkeys. Sweat drips onto player aides.

But I like that feeling. Maybe not all the time but I do like it. Sometimes my brain needs a good ass-kicking. Sometimes I need to be made aware, even if painfully, that, on average, I only use 10% of my brain. No game is as good at achieving that as Dominant Species. It is in a class of its own.

But: it's a long game, especially with six players, which is where it's at its best. It's not only long--it feels long. And it would be irresponsible to fail to mention that not all friendships can withstand this game. You've been warned.

RATING: 3
This game is simply too long because (1) it induces hilarious amounts of analysis-paralysis (AP), and (2) it is designed to be long.

(1) I know that there are some badasses out there who really can continue to effectively evaluate different placement options hour after hour, but I am not one of them. In this game, every worker placement action has you thinking about species-elements, resources, domination, wasteland, depletion, dominance cards, the point track, food chain order, tundra expansion, penguin scoring, tile type, migration, pawn execution order, speciation opportunities plus all the other stuff I forgot.

After 2 hours of this brain-burning, I just throw up my hands and utter a vulgarity. I like giving my brain a workout, but this game truly induces magnitudes more AP than Caylus, Agricola or Puerto Rico.  Those require thought, and a little AP now and then, but they are still manageable for normal people.      

(2) The 180 minute playtime is a minimum, not an average.  Why is the game so long?  There are 2 big reasons (beyond the AP discussed above): First, certain players will get more actions as the game progresses. (sidenote: this benefit is unbalanced).  More actions mean more playtime.  Second, you end the game by getting through the domination-card deck, but only a maximum of 5 domination cards will be taken each round. There are lots of those cards.

RATING: 6.5
Solid and interesting worker placement game. Competing species is a fun theme. The event cards are extremely powerful, and we jokingly call them 'magic super spells'.

The problem with this game is the length. With turn order changing each turn, reminding people whose turn it is takes a remarkable amount of time. This length problem is compounded by the complete perfect information of the game. To play optimally you MUST plan out your entire turn, and the turn of others ahead of time.

The food chain that breaks ties is a neat idea, except that there are so many exceptions to it it's an unnecessary addition.

The game is also confusing in that each tile has 2 owners: the dominant species, and the most numerous species. A shame this complicates the scoring so much.

Although most of this review is talking about the problems with the game, it's still a good game.

Tl:dr solid mechanics and fun theme unfortunately can't justify the game's length. Would love a shorter version of this.

I don't play many games that can run 3+ hours, but this one is so very worth it.  The gameplay revolves around incredibly powerful cards that can cause huge swings.  There is an incredibly clever mechanism where your species (and the earth) evolve allowing you to spread further, or forcing you to withdraw.  There is very little direct conflict (though there is some), but it is definitely highly competitive and interactive.  One of my favorite games.

RATING: 7.5
I actually think Dominant Species is a fairly brilliant game, but it plays a bit too long and I feel like the end-game scoring feels really chaotic.  So many of your points come in at the end of the game that it can almost feel like it trivializes everything else that has happened up to that point.  That feeling could very well go away with more familiarity with the game, but I found it to be a little bit of a turnoff.

Still, everything that happens in the game is pretty cool.  Seems to be best with two or three.

RATING: 2
I really disliked this game.
It was a 6 player game. Turns took forever, and I didn't care about everyone's moves since once it got to my turn again the board will be upside down so my plan would have to be though of again at the beginning of my turn anyway. The Dominance cards made the game to swingy and even more random.

That is the thing, the game was way too chaotic, and for something of this length (5 hours) I expect more control over the game.

Art is disappointing, I expected some cool animals in there. The mechanics are interesting though,

Everyone at the table kept saying that there was strategy, hidden underneath you just need to look for it. I kept saying it was so random I will just think of what to do when my turn came and don't worry about the next turn since there was no way to remotely predict what was going to happen next....I won.

RATING: 8
It tells an interesting story, I think, about how we might view the concept of evolution, or even also diversity, when you look at it, that all the different animal classes in this game are considered to have equal odds of winning, you know? And not only that, but that, also, we use the same pieces to represent all the varied animals here. Diversity, evolution, both of them perhaps mean little to nothing compared to tactics, strategy, and seizing of and adapting to opportunities and changes.
"You know there are no green mammals. So, I think, it says something fascinating about the player who insists on playing for the mammals and using the green pieces."
The game, unfortunately, produces too much deep, analytical and time-consuming thought for it to be brought out much.
"You almost never see it -- much like you never see a green mammal."
Though, I will say, with the quality of different Euro mechanisms going on here, I would love to spend all day putting out a play of this.

I'm told there’s an interesting game in here, but I didn’t see it. The abstract nature of the pieces make it look like a prototype and eliminate any feel of theme. I also find it difficult to grasp what is going on on the board, which might be my fault and not the game's. Regardless, left me cold.

RATING: 6.5
Rating based on one play. Very long playing time, analysis-paralisis and the definite possibility of one player far overcoming the others in the point track to the extreme of knowing who will win even hours before the end brings my rating down. I find it a bit boring that you can pretty much predict when the game is going to end, since the glaciation card will always be the last. Also a dinosaur on the cover of an ice age game? The artwork could be better too. Some cards seem like obvious choices, while the rest are too situational or plain underpowered.

I would greatly enjoy coming across a game that more accurately portrays the realities of population dynamics and genetics while staying playable, and this game didn't quite tick it for me in this sense either.

Those are the things I didn't about the game, but as a whole I enjoyed the experience, I like the theme and I think the game has its merits, making you feel how your species exploit new areas, compete for resources and dominance and strive to get away from the ever growing tundra...

As of September 2013, I've had just one play and I find myself rating it a 9 already.

It was a six player game, and took quite a while. But it seemed very balanced at the end despite the chaos that six players will bring (probably due to anyone in lead becoming the immediate focus of everyone's attention). I'm very curious to see if I end up preferring it with more players or less.

RATING: 5
I generally like heavier games.  However this one just has way too much "stuff" going on (half of the time, you're paying attention to the elements surrounding the tiles, the other half of the time, you're minding the majority of cubes on a tile).  I should count up all the different actions one can take on a given turn (rough estimate is near 30!).  It encourages AP, and I find myself just not caring much and just going with my gut when making decisions in the game (but, that's not the way to win).  It's tedious to constantly have to calculate dominance on each tile throughout the game. The game has too much chaos in that the game state can change so rapidly and dramatically that it's difficult to plan anything.  On top of that, it's fiddly with cheap components.  Specifically, the tiles are very thin--almost prototype quality (which I could easily overlook if the game were great).  It's a game that I respect the designer for, but is just too much for me.  As for area majority, I'd rather play 2 or 3 games of El Grande in that duration.  Or with 5 players and 4 hours, give me Die Macher.

Interesting worker placement game. This one has some teeth, as you can directly affect other players with actions and/or cards. IMO, this is the best of the AP games, and I've played a lot of them.

Keeping track of domination is a bit of a pain. The game is a bit on the long side but not too bad, and it can be shortened with the removal of a few of the cards that provide extra action pawns.

It's a very dense game, but I think most of it is in the strategy; anyone with even a little bit of ecology knowledge would likely find most of the actions and flow of the game fairly intuitive and I think helps the theme to really shine through. It is by nature a very mean game, since a lot of the time you're just trying to kill everyone else off in the quickest most damaging ways. You're constantly having to formulate some plan, and reformulate it when someone takes the action you wanted from underneath of you, or maybe does something that makes you taking a certain action useless.

It can, however, get really mathy having to check dominance in each area all the time.

It's like El Grande on steroids with a lot more to think about, but so, so good when you settle in.

[December 2015 - 9.3]
I really enjoy this game for both its simplicity and complexity. Plus, as many have stated, it's a wonderful balance of a Euro with interaction and conflict.

Simplicity: As my friend likes to say "the game runs itself" with the action tree on the board -- only dependent on which actions players choose. Then, the order of play and actions themselves are largely all taken care of.

Complexity: There's a lot of keep track of and a boatload of strategies to win -- a lot dependent on what your opponents do. In this sense, it reminds me of another one of my favorites, Hansa Teutonica. The area control aspect of the game -- species count vs dominance -- reminds me of Tammany Hall, where there are really a couple of battles being waged with the same pieces. I also enjoy the side battle for the tundra and the bonus points.  

There is great propensity for 'analysis paralysis,' but my tip is to 1)Focus on the current round 2)Think about a few places you can score -- both on your tiles and an opponent's tiles. Another way to speed up gameplay is to use dice (20d are best) to signify the dominance score of the leader on each tile. That saves constant re-counting and remembering who's in the lead on which tiles.

My only gripe might be that the cards are pretty over powerful. I see that there are 'no-card variants' so others must agree. Because of this, it's pretty crucial to be early in the dominance scoring and therefore crucial to be earlier in the initiative order. However, I'm sure there ways to balance things out, and the group needs to be aware of keeping leaders in check. However, don't focus too much on the current leader, focus on who's charging to lead the next round -- typically the controller of the tundra or the person who has two action pawns in the dominance scoring.

I really enjoy the depth of this game, and the careful considerations you must investigate each time new domination cards bring each round.

I am not yet convinced that the person whom played the best will be the winner a vast majority of the time.  This is keeping my rating lower than it could be, but may be resolved as we play the game more.

This is one of the only games to give me that Twilight Imperium "huge scope" feel while still playing with 2 in less than 8 hours (barely, with the 2x3 variant).  An amazing game with sweeping turns; I do feel like there are some strange design decisions in the cards and we've had to houserule some stuff to keep it on the table.

This game has one of the most unintuitive rule sets I've ever come across. A huge portion of the game is collectively trying to determine who has dominance in each region and making sure nothing is being done incorrectly.  Very few games make me feel more like an accountant at work during tax season. I'm befuddled at how this could be rated so high.  Thousands of games exist that provide the same amount of depth but with more intuitive rules (and less of them).

If you enjoy games where getting better is largely about figuring out how the rules work, then this is your game!  You're in the majority here of the BGG so take my personal opinion with a grain of salt.

deep and immersive gameplay, lots of strategic choices and little reliance on luck make this an almost perfect title. There might be some AP, though, and the person knowing the cards best will have a little edge. Very thematic and tight, however.

RATING: 8.5
An epic game on an epic topic. Only played one 6-player games so far, so the rating may udge around a bit.

Lots to do and think about so a little bit overwhelming for the first half of the first game trying to see how the actions and mechanics all fitted together to give VP's. The mechanics implement the theme quite well although the cubes are a little bit abstract to do so in this regard - some plastic animals woudl have been cool.

Game length is a slight concern to the extent that I can't see this making the table with anyone other than 'gamers' but still a great game.

Interested to see what I feel about this when I play it again as since my one play of this I have grown a bit weary of the really tight worker-placement type games.

Played our first session of Dominant Species on Saturday - five players - all experienced Eurogamers - two of us are also long time grognards.

The game is well designed, the rules are clear, well laid out and quite intuitive. The in-game decisions are challenging and tough as you try and weigh long-term benefits against short term gain.

I didn't expect this to be a great game but as a supporter of both GMT and Chad/Kai (Combat Commander is one of my top 5 games of all time) I thought I'd P500 it to "support the team". Although it is a good game it is too long. The "sweet spot" timing-wise for Eurogames is about 60-90 minutes for a 4-5 player game, in my opinion. It takes a real game design genius to engage all the players for 60-90 minutes - only God could design a game which keeps everyone fully engaged for 3-4 hours! Although Chad is semi-divine, I don't think you've pulled it off here...

As soon as our game was over, a couple of the players said they would play again if we shortened the game by doing something like the following:

Remove 5 Dominance Cards

Shuffle the Ice Age card into the bottom 5 (or 10!) cards.

This would of course make the game quite a bit shorter at the cost of impairing long term strategy, but in these players opinion, the game isn't worth 3-4 hours effort for the fun returned.

I offer this honest assessment of our group, who has played just about every Eurogame produced since 1998, in a positive constructive way. If this were a 90 minute game I would give it a 9 (excellent) rating on Boardgamegeek. As it stands, I give it a 7 (good).

The Domination cards are a little too wildly different in power for it to be a great game, but at least you see them coming for a turn.  Really good worker choices, good map system, great race powers.  But wetlands is the wrong color, and not tying the colors to the races was just dumb.

RATING: 6
This is a game that I feel I should really love or really hate.  Somehow it falls in between.  It's a lot like El Grande but with more mechanisms and variables to limit where, how, and why you would choose a region to take area majority.  Unfortunately, with so many variables and mechanisms, it is not at all clear what will be the repercussions of everyone's move.  So you kind of hope for the best and see how much you screw or get screwed over.  It's a long game though..that cannot be denied.  There are simply too many options to think it all through.  And really you have to think it through or get butchered by careless mistakes.  There can be some serious AP here.  But that aside, it's a good game...I like the mechanisms they've chosen to constrain actions.

Update - dropping this from 7 to 6 and could drop further.  Just not my type of game any longer.  Too much "take that".

Dominant Species was quite a surprise for me. I had not played a Chad Jensen game before, and was only knew him as a war game designer, so it was only vaguely on my radar. On a whim I read the rules for the game and was floored for two reasons: First of all, the rules were among the best I had ever seen, and secondly because of the clarity of the rules I was easily able to tell this was going to be a great game.

[ImageID=805598]

I pre-ordered it immediately, and when it showed up the following week I made sure to get it on to the table ASAP. The night after my first play, I went home and wrote a review ([thread=561327][/thread]). Since then I have played the game eight times, it was my most played game of the month, and each of these plays has only reinforced my opinion that this game is a masterpiece, a game that combines a number of disparate elements together in such a way that those who can appreciate heavier, more complex and interactive games will not help but be impressed by the design. This game alone was enough to turn my opinion of this year’s games around; if it was the lone good heavy design this year I would consider this a great year for games, the strong crop that looks like it is coming out of Essen has merely reinforced that opinion.

Players are trying to gain victory points on an ever-changing ancient earth.  Players play a class of animal (reptiles, arachnids, etc) and try to propagate their animal species across the hex tile representation of earth.  Habitat chits exist on the hex vertices, and you need matches with your animal mat to ensure ongoing survival in a adjoining hex.   Players take actions to manipulate the earth, the habitat chits and their species to try and earn majorities, and hopefully gain access to the enormously powerful Domination cards.  Rock solid worker placement/area majorities game - at it's heart a pretty theme-less Euro cube-pusher with area majority scoring, however it's been dressed up nicely with some nice scientific terms which disguises the bland theming underneath.  Enjoyable, and very well presented.  Great set of rules - you get the impression a lot of time went into testing and getting this right.  I'm not totally convinced the 3-4 hour playtime is right for this type of game (I'd rather play Die Macher if I had time for a long Euro).  If you play with a ruthless group who pounce on weakness, you may be in for a miserable time.  Other than that, if you don't mind the playtime, go for it.

Kind of a brain burner, but a good, solid strategy game. My one gripe with it is the evolution cards. Some of those are *WAY* too powerful, it seems. Had a game where I wiped one guy's entire species off the map due to one card. Maybe this balances out in more games, but it seems like the cards can be pretty brutal.

In essence this is an overly-long and heavily-themed variant of El Grande. As the glaciers expand, species move into uninhabited biomes and compete for survival. Decent, but very chaotic and features the "I took that action so now you can't" mechanism that has been overplayed since Wallace games and Caylus were all the rage. Still, better than most of the genre but it's a genre I'm not inclined towards.

Very cool game, which no one wants to play with me. Other than it's length, the reasons for this are unclear to me. This game is almost perfect. Everything is interconnected and matches the theme perfectly. Every decision you make influences the balance of the ecosystem, which is about to establish on the game-board. The ever-present struggle for dominance and fighting off extinction, with on-crawling glaciers which turn your precious habitat into tundra, every aspect of this game oozes theme and complex awesomeness. My only complain about this masterpiece is that the presentation could be a little less dry. All those wooden cubes of abstract shape may scare away potential players. Maybe this game needs some cute little Animal Meeples like Caverna.

Wow this is a brain burner, outside of Go I don't remember a game with so many options.  Well done ...I like the simplistic clean aesthetics of the game...wish they had animeeples.  Great gamers game, but I would not try teaching this to non-gamers due to the length and the sheer number of options on each turn will make their brains freeze.  I have heard some say this has Wargame elements and a little bit of a wargame feel, I strongly disagree.  If you like long (our 4 player game was 6 1/4 hours)brain burner games give this a spin.

RATING: 8
Intuitive worker-placement engine which drives the placement of cubes onto hexes for two types of area majority scoring - quantity and quality.   Very thematic implementation, and one of the best rulebooks I've seen in ages, clearly written with tons of examples.   The game is a bit too long, but this can be adjusted by taking out 5 or more random cards before playing.   My one major complaint is that you are constantly needing to calculate and recalculate dominance across all the hexes when elements are added/subtracted from the map or from the player sheets.  It's simple math, but can become a nuisance.  With good players, it's less of a problem.  But as a result, AP-prone players could kill the experience.  The dominance cards are extremely powerful, which will be a criticism of the game for some folks, so you cannot neglect turn order if you are trying to plan ahead.   But it's more of a tactical game anyway, there's not a lot of long term strategic planning.

I'm not entirely sure why I love Dominant Species so much. I think it's the idea of a swarm of aqua-spiders suddenly infesting the entire ocean and completely exterminating the innocent deep-water lizards. Seriously, you can describe everything that happens in the game as a dramatic change to the ecosystem of this world, and it's hilarious.

Couple this with some great worker placement. Competition for first place ("speed") is deeply valued here for the sheer variety of the actions and how much clever play can benefit you. Correctly dominating, keeping your creature adapted to the world, and freezing the face off opponent species - it's all good stuff.

RATING: 5
I've tried this one a couple times, but don't seem to enjoy it.  First off, it's really long and [i]really[/i] thinky.  Not normally a killer for me, but it is when combined with the second point: it's also really dry and abstract.  Oh, and it can also be punishingly difficult.  This is not a good combination.

Mostly, the design choices in this game rub me the wrong way.  Cubes are removed from the game when game when they die.  Fair enough, the species goes extinct.   But you have a limited pool of cubes to begin with.  What, the genetic diversity of insects is capped at 80?  I think not.
At its core, it's an area majority game, but a 2-tier one.  You have to have the most cubes to get most points, as usual.  But you also need a region where you can achieve 'dominance', defined as having more food sources of your type than anyone else.  This gets into the whole other system the game uses.  One third of the game is really manipulating these food type tokens.  You put them on & off your sheet, on & off the board, and so on..  The procedures for doing so aren't [i]that[/i] arcane, but it's still more complex and multi-step than I'd prefer.  Dominance is also almost entirely separate from regular cube scoring.  As long as you have at least 1 cube there, you're eligible.  
After you're done juggling those, the rest is manipulating cubes and tiles.  Cubes have more procedures as to where they can be placed and removed, and soak up actions to do so.  It really felt to me like it was easier and more profitable to kill off guys than to place yours out.  Once again, the theme falls flat.  When one species establishes a predatory relationship with another, they're not engaging in some xenocidal war.  They're not trying to wipe out all of the prey species: that would deprive them of a food source.  
Anyway, the last part of the game is tiles, and if you take the actions, you have tremendous freedom to shape the board.  It seems to me a little too easy to deploy tiles in a chain and create your own little backyard at the edge of the board, away from the advancing glaciers.  This lets you create a small paradise for your phylum that you can score points for repeatedly.  
Oh, and after all that is the cards.  These can be seriously swingy, and you really have to fight for area dominance and pick order to get them.

Anyway, my training in biology means I like the theme & the idea, and some of the execution, but the rest of it is a big mismatch.  The actual gameplay is way too tedious and fiddly for me to really enjoy playing it.  It's probably a good game, but not one I'm ever going to have fun with.

Okay, I'm very surprised at how good the game is. The gameplay is simple yet there are so many tough decisions to make.

The artwork is very bland, almost like a prototype, but people seem to be okay with it.

One problem that I have is the need to constantly check which species belong to which player and also colour. I wish the species are colour specific. 

The event cards seem to be a little swingy. The effect is freaking powerful, often end up in huge blow. 

The fact that the game is playable with six is a huge plus, and the amazing thing is that it shines with that many players. Playing with six will definitely be a long one, however both my six-player games ended at about three-hours long (which is not the usual).

A long game, easily over three hours, but simple to explain and the flow of play is very natural and it keeps the players constantly involved and thinking. Great theme, I'm a sucker for games about evolution, and I got the third printing which has great looking components. The game can be a little swingy with effects clearing sections of the board and making major changes to the map, but you still feel like you have enough control over the situation to adapt, which after all is the whole point of a game about adaptation.

Not sure how often I'll get to pull this one out because of the length, but it's definitely a game I'd recommend playing if you can.

Highly thematic, card driven, area control strategy game. A thematic euro hybrid almost on the brink of being a simulation of wildlife biosphere.

Mechanically this is a pretty heavy worker placement style game that could bog down with players that need to calculate every move. Thematically i find it a bit weird that I, the player represent some invisible force deciding how my species group will choose to evolve (is a choice actually involved in this process?). It does follow the basic precepts quite well though, do you want to specialize or be a generalist? The best strategy is to avoid hard competition. In play your going to try and control areas of the board and match icons to stuff on your player mat. Its quite cut throat with some reward cards and some aggressive actions. In some ways it feels like another more complex passing of El Grande given you are trying to cover the board in cubes.

Finally got to play this and with 6 players to boot.  This is, in no loose terms, an epic game.  I'm sure it plays fine at other player counts and it seems the consensus is 4, but playing with all 6 for the first time made this an unbelievable six-hour journey.  That's probably a player problem, but in defense of the game, it certainly didn't feel like six hours and that's when you know you're completely engaged.

With 3000+ comments on it, there's not much for me to say other than that this is an incredible design.  The only hitch is that without prior plays, forming your strategy and making your opening moves can be a daunting, confusing task.  Not until the game is well under way will you be able to figure out just what you ought to be doing.  The action display keeps everything moving at a decent clip and with so many options available, it's easy to get lost in the movement of its parts and forget about the goal.  Sometimes you just want to do something just because you can, but it can horribly fail you in execution (such was the case when I sacrificed a crapload of birds just to get a few measly points).

Way too much effort for what it delivers. A dizzying number of mechanics and rules just to determine which player gets to play a card.

Although not ideal for 2 players, hope it will be good enough to play.....

Played with 3, (me and 2 daughters) took 3.5 hours.  We chose an alternative where we split the domination cards into 3 stacks and randomly stuck ice age into the last stack, shuffled, and then put the other two stacks on top.

Brilliant game and everyone really enjoyed it.  Seemed to be no issues on understanding and implementing the rules.

Not a terrible game, but also not the type I typically enjoy.  There are a number of features I'm not fond of- it feels like there aren't enough of certain action spaces, and turn order is very difficult to change.  The "dominance" cards are extremely powerful, whether they nuke other players or give victory points.  And as before, claiming said cards all depends on turn order.  It could be that the different faction abilities help to balance out the kinks, but I'd need to play a lot more to see that.

a classic game of underdevelopment by the publisher. a good concept of a game that needed playtesting under the direction of a quality game developer.

that said - i would full support the varrient that removes 10 or 15 cards from the deck randomly.... it easily would shave 1-2 hours from the game without a loss of the feel.

I really enjoyed this game - the components and theme really work and the gameplay is solid. However, I really dislike teaching this game - the number of steps per turn is daunting and trying to help new players understand what they mean and the importance of each step is just impossible. It was a tough decision to let this go, but I did not want to continue teaching this game every time I wanted to play. Lastly, the cards can be gamebreaking if everyone is not aware of what they are capable of. I feel that with experienced players, choosing the first domination slot would be the first move, simply for the benefit of the card.

60-90m, best with 4-5 players. 5+ plays.

2014-10-27 : Wonderful worker-placement area-control game where all the mechanics interlock in a beautiful and streamlined way. 

Every round you find yourself in the position where you absolutely, positively have to do 3 things and you only got 2 actions left - that's something I like a lot in a game. Graphics and layout and especially the player board which in essence contains all the rules are great (3rd edition) 

One thing that could use a little clean-up is terminology with regards to the words animal and species and in one or two cases the text on the cards could have used a couple extra words.

Then there's 2 things I don't like about it 

1) The dominance cards are too powerful and feel like they can almost randomly muck-up a perfect play. Toning them down a bit, or a lot in some cases, would improve this game's rating from an 8 to a 9 

2) The tie-breaker rule - why couldn't this have been some player accomplishment like number of domination cones or most species on the board ? Picking food chain feels like a lazy design choice that should have been last in the list of tie-breakers.

Jesse's variant:

Remove Intelligence, Parasitism, Omnivore, Immigrants, Blight.  Give everyone an extra action pawn, and remove 5 of each of the elements from the bag.

Comments:  I don't think people need an extra action pawn.

Played a 3-player game with 2 experienced players.  Although they explained and helped, it was a very frustrating experience for me and I didn't do well (no surprise!).  I didn't completely understand why they were doing what they were doing and what I could be doing to score more points and position myself better.  The game feels fast, not long, and a day later I realized that I should have been exploiting my special status as top of the food chain on every round--which I didn't.  I also didn't understand the Glaciation action, or to be exact, how I could use it to my advantage and my opponents' disadvantage.  I also didn't try to get the Survival card which was another option open to me.  All in all, I can't rate or even say if I'd like to play again.  Lots of moving parts--which are interesting, engaging, and move quickly--but require experience to understand how they all flow, mesh, and coordinate, to aid a player in performing well.

Here's how I envision this game's creation. Chad Jensen was sitting around one day eating a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and he looked over to see a copy of Age of Empires III on top of a copy of Primordial Soup sitting right next to the couch. Or maybe he accidentally box dumped one game into another. You get the reference.  

I may be a prude, but I think tactical and chaotic gamestates have their places. In a worker placement game is not one of those places. I also tend to believe that chaotic games should be shorter in nature. There's so much happening that AP is basically guaranteed, which is again not going to help the length. In a nutshell the game seemed to be of acceptable design. There's nothing really super new or Earth shattering, but Eurogames have established a standard that this is completely acceptable. For me personally, this game was a total miss. What I disliked from AoE III is here in larger numbers, and the take that nature of the action cards was just another nail in the coffin. Many gamers will find an excellent game in this box. I did not. For me it was too chaotic, too long, and too short on ability for strategic planning.

This game is more than merely random. It's arbitrary. And that's not good for a long game. I half suspect the length is the designer's attempt to even out the randomness but it doesn't work because the issue is arbitrariness, not randomness. 

Random chit pulls of elements combined with AP, metagaming and kingmaking makes a poor game. Oh, and it's fiddly too, like to calculate dominance, so much so that there's a rule that dismisses it as a problem.

There's no reason to play this as long as El Grande and Die Macher are available.

[1 play] I guess I'd be willing to try this again, but so far I'm not feeling it.  It just seemed like a huge clanking Rube Goldberg contraption of a game.  There are SO many interlocking parts that it seems like it would tend toward one of two extremes: either you play swiftly and intuitively, and things unfold in a random and unpredictable way, or else you try to analyze the effects everything is going to have on everything else, and it becomes a living nightmare of analysis paralysis.

I last logged a play for this 3 years ago, shortly after I got it.

Game takes far too long to be worth while imho. Elegant rules, but the well balanced play is overshadowed by the LONG length of game (3 hours for our 5 players) - it's constantly difficult and time consuming to assess dominance on each hex as the game progresses, long bouts of analysis paralysis and a lengthy reset phase at the end of every round really hurt the gameplay.

The board and components are visually amateurish - bad illustrations on the cards, ugly typography and poor visual coding really hurt the visual appeal and make it hard for new players to pick up the mechanics. The box art is fantastic, wish the game components had the same appeal.

That said, it could make a great smart phone/iPad game if a computer was the score keeper and the art was updated.

This game has the potential of a 9 or 10 score in terms of strategy and theme. Unfortunately there are some heavy drawbacks like the lacking component quality (or choice of components), the long summary phase of each round and the fairly long downtime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
No game in my experience provides a higher rate of gut-churning decisions, and if you base the quality of a game on that, then this is one for you.  You will spend a lot of time agonizing over the next decision to make and the one you just made.  I used to think that I didn't like worker placement games, until I played this and realized that this action selection could actually be used in a game with gobs of interactivity.  The best I've played of this type.

It's beautiful to look at, pretty abstract, but hella mean, which helps the hours fly by pretty well (although in a six-player game, it seems almost inevitable that one player will get shafted and wish death on the rest of the game).  The cards are not a luck element - you simply have to manage your position better, or punish other players for not taking the other several actions they needed to take along with that sweet card.  The element draws do seem to be the primary luck issue, although I don't think they are determinative by any means.

There was a brief time when I thought the glaciers were a kludgy catch-up mechanism, but now I think they are grand, and the most strategic part of the game.  Only problems (which prevent me from putting in my all-time favorites) are the enormous difficulties in plotting outcomes in the last turn - making it impossible to make a move you feel good about (and causing terrible AP to those who suffer), and the possibility that the game will start to seem repetitive after several plays.  Whereas each game should present different tactical challenges, I worry that it does not offer strategic variety and is ultimately the same game with players being shunted into the slightly different scoring roles.  Maybe that's no different than any other game, but as marvelously fun as this is, I have some concern that people might play it out.

Having just taught myself Francis Tresham's Revolution: The Dutch Revolt, I see a lot of similarities which helped clarify my feelings about DS.  This game is extremely dynamic compared to Dutch Revolt, while sharing a lot of core ideas.  It is fairly easy to move pieces across the board and into new areas.  This dynamism strikes me as a strength and weakness: Stengths - well dynamic, fun, allows players to easily shift short-term aims, creates lots of tactical opportunism; Weaknesses - difficult to plan ahead too far and a lessening of importance of early game decisions and positions, previously mentioned filtering of players into repeating scoring roles.

1 play - 6: a lot of the actions feel samey and convoluted.  Initial reaction is also that the game won't have the type of replayability i like (no hidden information and very little randomness).

3 plays - 2: the design is incredibly good.  I just can't stand wargames, metagame politics and kingmaking.  It's just not my type of game.  If it were great with 2 players i could have got into it.

RATING: 6
This is a game I respect more than I like, quite honestly. The gist of the game is not being able to see what the consequences of your actions will be until they happen. So each turn you’re just doing what seems best and then hoping most (or some) of it will work to your favor. It’s like running an obstacle course in the dark and seeing who gets through best and who gets a two-by-four to the face.  It took me a while to understand that you can’t foresee much so your efforts are more about damage mitigation than opportunism. In fact, being too opportunistic early on just rewards you with a bullseye on your back. 

Personally, I could do with less chaos and less play time. I’m firmly convinced there’s 3 hours of gameplay here “squeezed” into 5-6 hours of time. All the gyrations the players must go through are to see who can earn the right to dominate and thus get to play a really powerful card that’s going to tilt the table vastly in one direction, thus rendering a lot of the previous gyrations null. Then you start the next turn and do it all over again. It feels like the game could be half as long and still render the same experience. 

You repeat the slugfest until you get to the final, critical turn when half the game’s points are at stake, and here’s where you need to be as opportunistic as possible while hopefully relatively insulated from catastrophe. The effort to fight through the game to be in position to win on the last turn feels like a boxing match. It might be 5-6 hours of mental pugilism, but if you can be the one left standing at the end, well, it’s extremely satisfying. I’ll play it on occasion when I feel like putting myself in the ring for the thrill of testing my endurance.

I love, love, love:
- the theme and asymmetric players
- that it's a nice mix of strategy and tactics
- the mechanism of placing all APs then doing actions
- the many layers of choices involved
- the equal weight on number of species and dominance, so you can't focus entirely on one or the other
- the swings in dominance between players
- the board is gorgeous to look at as the game goes on
- the Domination Cards can really swing things around if played right

I dislike:
- the game can go on a while(?), but fortunately, we usually play two-player and go through the Domination Cards quickly, so the game isn't usually an all-afternoon affair

Final verdict: A game of chess but so, SO much better.

Variant suggestion: Randomly remove 1/4-1/3 of the Domination Cards to decrease play time? Will have to play-test.

There's a lot going on in this game.  It has a lot in common with El Grande, but with more moving parts.  In El Grande I can at least imagine to myself that I can predict what the other players will do, but here it seems impossible, giving the game an entirely different feel.

Our game suffered from some analysis paralysis, and we were only playing a 3-player game with one animal each.  Also, there was a lot of whacking in the endgame.

My problem with the game isn't that I think there's no skill.  It's that I was having no fun at all while playing it.

This is a very well designed game. The special abilties of the insects and the arachnids are very powerful compared to those of the reptiles and the mammals but this is balanced out by the food chain where mammals break all ties and insects lose all ties. 

This means that insects and arachnids need to have a lot of species in an area if they want to score well and mammals and reptiles can sometimes cheekly move in a single species and clean up on points. 

Tundra tiles cripple your species as they are all wiped out bar one however there is a series of bonus points available for most species on tundra to compensate.

Over speciation can result in you running out of new species to put on the board and thus expanding into newer point-scoring areas.

2017-10-30: Like the theme and the mechanics were kind if integrated but it still felt like playing very abstract to me.
Not as harsh with attacking as I thought, but the foodchain is a highly irritating mechanic if you are low on it (I was spiders).
I also had a hard time seeing what way to play to win, but I can absolutely see that as just a newbie-problem. Next time it would probably be a lot easier to do the 'right' moves.
Biggest culprit of the game though: Time. It is too long for what it is. Long games to me shold have engine-building and this didn't feel like that at all. Although you 'adapt' to more kinds of food you are constatly running low on cubes and gets pushed out by other players or ice or events that remove your food.. . So no. .Too long for that kind of game.

Initial rating = 5 (which is quite good for its length!)

Rating change from 8.7 to 8 (after two more plays):
The endgame seems very hard to predict or manage given the huge swing caused by the Iceage card and the final scoring of each tiles.  It seems impossible to determine who is in the lead before Iceage/final scoring takes effect.  It might change with more experience with the game.

Dominant Species is a dominating game. After three plays, this is one of my clear favorites. The area control and worker placement mechanics are perfectly balanced to create a tense, engaging struggle for survival.

The length of the game prevents this from being a 10. It was however, very easy to get wrapped up in gameplay. In other words, Dominant Species is a 3-4 hours game that feels like 90-120 minute game.

This game does not disappoint.

-Interesting theme that blends with gameplay
-Lots of options for actions, each with their own use
-Good mechanical gameplay design, e.g. clearly lots of thought put into the order in which actions execute
-Some nice artwork (I have 4th edition)
-Numerous components (even if simplistic), good rulebook
-Supports 2-6 players, scales fairly well (fewer actions per player)

Cons
-Heavy thinking game and long game (and down) time not suitable for everyone
-Can induces analysis paralysis since there are quite a few options. Also hard to instant remember what each option is (e.g. wasteland and depletion...hmm which is which again?).

-Constant need to recalculate dominance in each tile. Tiles are also very misleading since quantity of your population doesn't matter for dominance (you can have 50 cubes on a tile, but someone with 1 cube can out-compete you if they have just 1 more element matching)
-Somewhat fiddly (constantly moving cubes around)
-Theme mis-match: land tile are only variable by how they score and how easy it is to expand population on it. They don't have any inherent benefit towards any of the elements or species. A "Desert" tile doesn't necessarily start with a sun element, and it can just as easily be surrounded by 6 water elements as 6 of any element.
-Weird use of glaciation - how do animals control the rate and location of glaciations?

-Species don't feel very different. 
-Evolutions are lame, just one off abilities or tacking on an extra element (as opposed to new powers)
-Missed potential for combat. You just remove 1 cube.

-Components barely fit into box unless insert is removed
-Use of cubes instead of animal meeples (though that would be quite pricey since there are lots of components).

Some things I think I know after getting hammered in one play:

This is a great worker placement / area majority game with no hidden information. But it may not be for you if you don't like long games that feel somewhat chaotic. There is significantly more player interaction than other popular worker placement games like Caylus and Age of Empires 3, and most of that interaction is very confrontational. This game can get very mean!  In my humble opinion, this game is easier to learn than most heavy worker placement games, and the rulebook is very straightforward and well-written. I'm tempted to knock it down half a point in my ratings because it takes significant effort to constantly re-calculate who has dominance on each tile based on the elements, but the fiddliness could be worse.

Components are very sturdy, but not that pretty. If they had had some kind of minis to represent the various animal types, and something that made more sense than wooden cones to represent domination, it would have taken this to the next level!

The theme in this game fits very well. It involves playing as a family of animals (reptile, amphibian, mammal, bird, insect, or arachnid) where you populate the world with new species of your animal and try to dominate the world to survive the ice age. It takes a while to play, feels a bit like Agricola, but it isn't tedious. This game includes plenty of choices, and for the overcautious could lead to AP, but there seems to be enough leeway where making a poor choice once or twice won't ruin the game, so AP should be avoidable if you have the right attitude.

Its okay. I had a hard time with analysis paralysis. some people might like a simple board I find it a disadvantage. Theme wise its really hard for me to get behind victory points in this game. (where as most vp games don't bother me). Mechanics while not super original work well together. My biggest complaint is having to recalculate dominance in every region I have a species in after almost every action.  This game is not fun for me.

RATING: 7.1
Lembra muito o [thing=22545][/thing]. O sistema de "locação de trabalhadores" e resolução dos mesmo é muito parecida, com uma grande diferença: as ações são muito mais interligadas umas com as outras, isso é muito legal, inclusive algumas ações influenciam os 3 turnos seguintes nessas "actions boxes".
Outra característica importante do jogo é que ele tem uma disputa de área enorme, não somente controle de maioria nos territórios como no AoEIII. Toda rodada tem muito conflito e mudanças no tabuleiro pois disputa-se simultaneamente o controle da maioria no território e a dominação das especies no território. 
Essa dominação lhe dar importantes cartas de evento ao final da rodada. Estas cartas controlam o tempo de jogo e, na minha opinião, deixam o jogo "muito caótico". Elas estão totalmente dentro do tema, se encaixam muito bem mas é difícil planeja algo por 4 horas e toda rodada ser surpreendido por um evento devastador. Por causa disso, pegar as melhores (primeiras) cartas é decisivo. Para pegar as primeiras cartas deves-se ser o primeiro a jogar. A vantagem de jogar primeiro passa a ser DECISIVA e para jogar primeiro demora muito e o custo é muito alto, achei a única falha do jogo pois, diferentemente do AoEII em que você assume o primeiro lugar na iniciativa ao escolher essa ação, no DS você apenas avança um espaço na iniciativa. Então uma coisa ficou muito amarrada a outra, fique em primeiro, pegue as melhores cartas, mantenha-se em primeiro, pegue as melhores cartas, etc. Isso ocorreu nas 6 ultimas das 8 rodadas de jogo.
Tirando isso, achei o jogo fantástico. São 4 horas de um bom jogo. Dou um 7.0 só não é maior por que é caótico e por esse problema da iniciativa.

This is the king of perfect 10 games: the best, most perfect game ever made.  As far as game design goes, Dominant Species is on the same level as Chess.  All the pieces and mechanics work together to form an amazing gaming experience and you better bring your "A" game to the table if you want to win in this tense, cut-throat battle to the death.  I simply couldn't ask for more in a game.  Great job, Chad!

Nagyon tematikus, nagyon összetett. 12 féle akcióból lehet választani, és egyik se olyan, hogy kapsz két sárga kockát. Nagyon jópofa az igények és erőforrások egymásra hatása és sodródása az akciók között, nomeg a dominancia számítás. 
Elég hosszú és bonyolult, nomeg extrém módon konfrontatív. Gyakorlatilag nincs olyan akció, amivel kizárólag építkeznél és ne másoknak ártanál. Így jól meg kell gondolni, hogy kivel játszik az ember.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Dominant Species lets you replay evolution. If that sounds grand, it is. The game is epic both in a thematic sense, spanning several 10,000 years, and in actual play time during which players strive to become the dominant species on the planet.

They do this by placing workers, selecting various actions that allow them to have their species adapt to changing conditions, migrate, breed, and so on. The main part of this battle for survival happens on the modular map. This part of the game employs a two-dimensional area control mechanic in which you can either be the most populous species on a tile or be the best adapted (or both, of course). The map play is highly interactive with everyone trying to broaden their niche, deliberately making conditions less favourable for other species, or simply outright attacks.

Dominant Species has a ton of moving parts which is the main reason a game takes as long as it does. Analyzing the current state of affairs (and drawing sound conclusions from that) is hard. However, all of these parts fit together very well. There don't seem to be any dealbreakers, there are mitigation options for pretty much anything, and even the asymmetric species powers are balanced.

Overall, the game implements its theme amazingly well. At the end of the day it is still a multiplayer conflict game with all the issues that entails but it does also include a completely different layer that stays interesting even when the conflict does not.

Ein Wettstreit der Arten in der Frühzeit der Erdgeschichte als WP und Mehrheitenspiel, das im Spielgefühl erstaunlich gut darwinistische Lebensart widerspiegelt. Und das, obwohl das Spiel in der  äusseren Form abstrakt daherkommt: Eurowürfel, ein paar Fang-den-Hütchen, Hexfelder. DOMINANT SPECIES ist, was der Titel verspricht:  ein aggressives Kratzen und Beissen mit thematischen Ereigniskarten, das im tierischen Überlebenskampf keine Freunde kennt. Man braucht eine Zeit, um die Verzahnung zu verstehen, obwohl die Regeln an sich nicht kompliziert sind. Übung macht den Meister an den Fleischtöpfen. Ein Spiel, dem es gelungen ist, ein erbarmungsloses Thema in seinen Mechanismen konsequent wiederzugeben.

Deep, involved worker placement. I love the theme. A lot of accounting each turn. With an impending ice age, the weather and events are constantly changing making it hard to plan long term strategies. You should have general long term ideas but still be able to adapt. Don't be afraid to abandon a group of your species if they are in trouble. Big end game scoring.

Chaos! A very deeply layered game. Strategies are so easily derailed. You must think on your feet to optimize the choices you have by the time your AP is ready to be used.

Fantastic game.  Survival of the fittest.  Captures the nastiness of the evolutionary process with a well integrated set of two area control mechanisms with worker placement for action selection.   The tension of dealing with the constantly evolving map and opponent situation while setting yourself up for endgame scoring creates a myriad of options when you have a finite limit of moves.

At first I thought this was another action selection game - and actually it is. But it might be the most thematically linked and well-thought out action system game I've ever played! The theme is perfect.  Even though I'm pushing little cubes around, I really do feel for my animals and species that breed, dominate and go extinct through every round. The impending Ice Age feels crucial and adds much tension to the game. The player interaction works well. The cards - while screwy and provides lots of swings - adds character to the game. Such a well thought out game; I'm truly amazed. I can see where analysis paralysis could definitely slow down any player, but it would pretty much destroy somebody who can't think through a game like this. There are many actions one can take and different routes to success. There's always one thing you didn't see coming though, and that can be frustrating - even when expected. All that aside, a top game with clear rules and lots of room for thought and experience.

A modern classic that feels quite old presentation wise, but is still up there among the best area majority games I have played. 

The turns are quick. The worker placement steps are interesting with interconnecting mechanisms. Everyone takes turn placing workers then when all workers are placed actions take places in a predetermined order. This is great and makes the game flow quickly for our group. But I can see that playing with an AP-prone player it might really take a lot of time calculating all options. 

Areas are controlled in two ways, the one with most animals on an area gets most points when the area is scored. Of those who are present, the animal most adapted to the area get a special bonus card when the area Is scored. The special bonus cards are not balanced and can take some time to understand and really mess up other players plans. They slow down the game a bit, and if they where clearer easier to see at a glance that would be a great improvement.  

Scoring actions take place last in the round, so there are plenty of actions to take before scoring to get points from other players scoring. It is quite easy to see what area is best for them to score and increase your presence there. But if you increase so much you get majority, then the player will score another area instead. That is a really interesting mechanism that works well. 

Why are there so few games with this theme? It is amazing to be animals spreading across the land, adopting to the environment. They could have made the connection to the theme a lot stronger and the game more intuitive than it is, but the theme is still a great one. 

It is a really mean game with lots of kingmaking moments. You can destroy areas with glaciers or remove food so that animals that eat that starve and die. That is the nature of area majority games that I accept when playing them but really dislike. It is about taking control of areas from other players. When I gain something someone else have to lose it. That is something I do not enjoy and the reason no game like this will ever be my favourite. 

I could imagine a game with new areas that we take control of and that we never remove control. A friendly area majority game where we all grow and get better. The land grow here and our presence grows so there is a bit of that here. But it could be done more. 

During the game you adapt to eating different things, but other than that there is no arch of the game. Your options in the beginning are the same as in the end. 
But instead it is quick to learn with only a few rules (compared to other heavy games). Liked it would like to play again. 8/10

1) Incredibly long wait time between turns with 5 players.  Allegedly plays 6, but it's bad enough with 5.
2) Again, allegedly plays 5-6, but with 5, you can be locked out of round scoring.  With 6, at least one person definitely would be locked out each round.
3) Mean, I mean really mean.  Specific players can be targeted and destroyed.  Players can be ganged up on as well.
4) So much AP. From every player. OMG.  The playtime for four new players and one teaching was 4 hours but it felt like 8.
5) Player groups are VERY unbalanced. Don't play as mammals; you go last and your player power is useless. 
6) Reward cards are incredibly powerful. Maybe TOO powerful.
7) U-G-L-Y game - very generic pastel hex board.

All this being said the game has deep strategy and interesting choices.  It's more a war game than a worker placement and since it's overly long those two things mean it's not that fun.

The game is GOOD. The whole idea - of 2 kinds of domanance is great. But - struggling with the tokens and tons of cubes on the board is terrible. Additionally - hey! Come on, I work whole turn, put my AP here, put my AP there... OK, done the best I could. Now what? Here comes the massive special card - which crashed half of the things done before. OK - I know it's gonna' come. But if just messes upt too much.
And - you know, I'm a chemist. I do like computing, but... checking for dominance several times a turn - is that much tiresom, that I just stopped checking and done this only before the domination phase. This would've been a great board game game for online plays - just like Amun-Re.

This was far heavier and more difficult to play than I imagined judging from the rulebook.  Each action is simple, but the decisions are excruciating.  We played this with 3; I think it needs at least 4 players to get enough competition going.  

The Dominate action seems like a no-brainer, as is Glaciation. 

I feel somewhat disappointed by the game.  It feels a bit too random or chaotic.  There is almost too much going on.  I felt much the same way after playing Caylus for the first time, and my feeling about that game never got better.  I have higher hopes for Dominant Species.

Perfectly brilliant area control game with a theme that well fits the mechanics. Ignore naysayers that say the game is difficult to understand- it's very simple. What unfolds is a war of the species each with their own unique strengths, in desperate & tight competition for ever dwindling resources. Every action counts with tremendous effect. Applying a killer strategy, though, is not that easy- but can be a very enjoyable undertaking if accomplished. The game is brutal and punishes mistakes quickly, which, again, fits the theme perfectly. The 3rd reprint edition has a wonderful map-board and tiles- significantly improved over previous editions. If I could only take a few games to a desert island, this would be one of them.

Highly confrontational, AP prone, chaotic game of evolution and dominance.  Theme is nicely incorporated into this two-tiered area majority game.  First tier is pretty simple --most cubes (species) earn points.  Second tier provides powerful actions that can score, help you in the long haul, or seriously mess up one or more of your opponents.  If you can't handle a wild ride, don't even think about playing DS.

If this game was an hour shorter, it would be among my favorite games and at least a full point higher. Unfortunately, the length of a round gets exponentially higher as the game goes on, and however unlikely it might be, there's nothing stopping the game from going 9, 10, 12, or even 15 rounds. In the future, I'll only play with less cards or a hard limit on the number of rounds.

The boardgame equivalent of a street fight. It's brutal and mean, but it's really rewarding to play.
The only negative thing I can think of is that there is an issue of king making when certain cards are used.

A crunchy and rich worker placement game which mimics real world ecological shifts and asks player to adapt to the ever changing, player driven, tile-laying landscape. A game which models evolution to a certain degree of fidelity which perhaps leads to too much manual calculation and cleaning but nevertheless becomes the pre-eminent game on speciation and arguably worker placement!

1 play and I love this game.  The dominance mechanics make sense thematically while still providing challenges in gameplay, the rotating placement of actions and action resolution guarantees minimal downtime per player, and allows you to plan ahead to minimize AP.  All species have interesting special abilities which can be used advantageously.  There are enough different actions available to make it challenging, different, and allow different strategies to win.  Overall a great game I can't wait to play again.

This game is visually stunning but more importantly the game play and interaction between the players more than exceeds the visual elements to ensure a throughly enjoyable gaming session.

Not for everyone, explanation and depth of mechanics will put a lot of people off as will the game lenght.

RATING: 9
A long, chaotic, area control game where dominance is important, but needs to be balanced with scoring.  You must keep track of the elements in play or you will lose this game rapidly;)...One of my new favorites.  Tactical - not much long range planning in this one!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice game. So many balls to juggle with this one it seems, never enough actions and timing is everything.

It takes a while to wrap your head around the idea that it isn't just about dominance in a space due to the elements, but also there is the cube majority to take into account when it comes to get victory points.

I wish Doris Matthäus did the illustrations for this game.

RATING: 9.5
Whenever I play this, I marvel at the genius of this game! Every decision wracks your brain because there are so many consequences to what you pick and the order you do so. The theme works absolutely brilliantly here and represents the changing earth, dwindling supplies, and the encroachment of other species in to new areas. (I have a biological sciences background, so this is something that appeals to me.) 
It DOES take a while to play, and your head might hurt a bit after doing so.
For me, and some of the people I play with, this is what it's all about. Socializing with good friends and staying intellectually engaged and competitive.

I really enjoy this game. A lot of direct interaction, brilliant theme, and a constantly changing board. This is a very well made game and contrary to what other people say I think it is quite well balanced. Extremely high replayability with each game having a drastically different feel and result. Chaotic elements provides new challenges in each turn that you cannot anticipate and plan for from the previous turn, which I enjoy. You are never out of this game and the winner almost always comes from behind. A great reward for both strategic foresight and tactical play wrapped in a brutally competitive game.

RATING: 6.8
"Everyone" is saying its a cross between evo and age of empires and I guess that is a good starting point for evaluating this game.  It is a bit long for what it is and brings more aggressive actions (glaciation, eating your opponents, and dominance of regions and most members of species in area) so not really suitable for players who don't like a lot of conflict in their Eurogame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rarely does anyone think about what to do on their turn until their turn arrives.  Therefore the game just drags on and on and on. I fall asleep while waiting for my turn to come round again and then I contribute to the bored of others by then beginning to contemplate what to do on my turn.  Might be a good game if all players have had 3-4 games under their belt and keep the game moving at a brisk pace.

Simply the best game ever. It's a 2-3 hour game that I am fully engaged in every minute we're playing. It does what I think is the most important thing a game can do, which is on your turn you are always doing something good. If someone takes the spot you really wanted, that's okay there are like 10 other cool things you can do. It feels like you are always getting somewhere, even if it's not as optimally as possible.

RATING: 5
I've only played this once.  But it took 4 of us (only one person had played it before, and him only once) 7 hours.  It felt long and drawn out.  Maybe the Ice Age was freezing our brains but the whole table seemed swamped in Analysis Paralysis. Usually I am not one to take a long time on my turn but I was getting mired in choices like everyone else. And the one person who had played before, his first game had also taken 7 hours.  

And the game is very tactical as opposed to strategic. It was hard to plan ahead since you didn't know what crazy things your opponents would do.  While I might enjoy such a chaotic game if it was only 2-3 hours long, I really don't enjoy 7 hours of chaos where I feel I have no control.

If I was to play with 3 others who already knew the game and we could play it in 3 hours or less I might could rate it higher.  But TBH, I don't feel compelled to try it again.

The worker placement part of this game is fantastic, every space is good and someone is always taking exactly the one that you want! The asymmetry works well and it has surprisingly much player interaction for such a euroish game. It's a bit too swingy for my taste, though. I feel like we're just wasting time for 3 hours until someone kingmakes in the last round.

RATING: 7
Played on Minnesota Dan's 1st edition copy. I'm not sure what to make of the game. On one hand, it is very involved and I truly think the old chestnut "many paths to victory" apply here. Furthermore, the dynamic of resources being considered both for survival and dominance feel really fresh and interesting. The scoring is almost all tied to the bonus table chart which makes figuring out scores quite easy. On the other hand, the game has moments of being random and quite swingy. For such a long and involved game, I don't know if I can get really excited about a game that relies so heavily on these elements.

PROS
-High player interaction.
-Lots of planning & ways to win.
-Player abilities feel thematic.
-Nearly all scoring follows the bonus points table, which makes this quite easy to grasp.

CONS
-Randomness in resource tiles for Adaptation, Abundance, & Wanderlust. (Also randomness in Wanderlust tiles but this is less of an issue.)
-Randomness in event cards.
-Very swingy. In our first game we had massive lead changes -up to 20 VP - four times. End game scoring can also lead to some crazy scoring.
-Nitpick but I'd like to see the board indicate the three actions that get you VP - glaciation, wanderlust, & domination - plus the tundra scoring.

Wow! This game is amazing.  Like a fascinating enigma.  There is so much to think about that my wife literally said "My brain just exploded.  I thought I was onto something, but then it went *boom* and I'm done.  I'll just go here and see what happens."

We've played twice...with 10 dominance cards to keep it short.  Keeps the game at about 2 hours.  

A definite keeper, but I don't know anybody other than my wife who is going to want to play it with me.  It's a real brain burner.

UPDATE:  we can't seem to get this to the table.  Our 2 year old takes up a lot of time and energy, so it's a rare occurrence for us to have 3 hours and the energy multiple days in a row to focus on learning this game and playing it well.  We're still fascinated with it and WANT to play it, but it will probably have to happen during summer vacation when my schoolteacher wife is more well-rested.

My absolute all-time favorite game. Intense worker placement that creates wild variation between games, and one of the few games I know of where being eliminated from the board does not necessarily cripple you - I managed to come in third place in a tournament of this game after being completely wiped off of the board on turn one. Unfortunately the depth of the game and the length of time it takes to play this game means I've taught it to relatively few friends, since a game of this can frazzle everybody's brains for the night.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Marvelous, brilliantly-constructed game.

The best way I can quickly describe Dominant Species is that it's the state-of-the-art hardcore gamer's version of El Grande. The magic of El Grande was not just plopping cubes into regions and scoring 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place whenever a scoring round rolls along. Many games have done that sort of thing. No, the magic was in the jockeying for the special game-breaking actions that put the game state in constant flux, and provided countless ways of screwing up your opponents' plans. Dominant Species has the same kind of fun in the box.

But of course, Dominant Species is more than just Advanced El Grande. It combines the best parts of El Grande with the smooth menu selection / action drafting / worker placement of games like Caylus, Agricola, Age of Empires, and seemingly every other game released over the past five years. That sort of system works best when it creates the feeling that there are three or four or five things you absolutely must do right away, and you might be totally screwed if you don't get to do them. Agricola, for example, gets this right. Most of the other games in the genre get it wrong. Dominant Species gets it right.

And for all its mechanical beauty, Dominant Species also features an organic, compelling theme that meshes amazingly well with the game systems. I really do feel like I'm doing the sort of things I ought to be doing in a game about protean creatures that are adapting, surviving, proliferating, dominating. My role is that of a god-like shepherd and provider for my creatures. I'm not just guiding their actions. I'm also shaping the world itself to create an environment where they can thrive.

While the concept of a combination of area influence and worker placement isn’t unique as it has been compared to [thing=22545][/thing], the integration between the mechanics is more seamless here. This makes it impressive and coherent experience. The game has some really tough decisions because the game is open-ended and that it can lead to some serious analysis paralysis. 

I found it more interesting in theory for my first game than in practical execution though. There are many things I admire in this design, the choices between spreading out or get more adaptable and dominant, but it was hard for me to wrap my brain around it and too much player driven chaos. That said, I would love to play it some more.

Dominant Species is an excellent worker placement game for 2 to 6 player.  The goal of the game is to adapt you species the most effectively before the Ice Age occurs.
Actions allow you to adapt your species to new element, add or remove element from Earth, add new tile to the Earth, change existing terrain into tundra, kill other species, add your own, etc.
I like this game a lot!

It felt like El Grande on Stereoids. More options and a bit less chaotic, but the cards offer strong take that effects so that you're still suprised what may happen on the board. The key point is to find a good balance between Dominance and majorities. The last round is decisive and sadly prone to kingmaking. It takes 3 hrs to play but is not boring if at least you don't play with a/p players as some decisions are made by pure calculation of what cubes to place or push over there... I deducted 0.3 from my rating for typos on the board and cards (German Edition)

Heavy euro, with extreme area majority. 

I don't understand the glaciation move, nor most of the nuances. 

Adaptation is key. Cards powerful but not that powerful as thought at first. Wanderlust is very powerful and Competition not to be underestimated. 

Do I like this? I don't know yet.  

UPDATE
Played this again. I was surprised at how prototype-like the components looked (it was a 1st edition) a surprising thing from GMT, they might have changed these in later editions of the game, I guess. 

As for the game in itself, it played with four people around four hours, excluding the rules re-explanation. I'm starting to lean on the "not liking this game". 
I would play again just to understand once and for all if I do or I don't like it, but I'm not in a whole rush to do so. Quite frankly there are other games out there I would rather spend my limited time on.

11 games in.  This game just gets better and better.  Accessible game play familiar to Europhiles (worker placement and area control) with tones of Ameritrash (variable player powers, direct confrontation, a smidgen of chaos and a strong, engaging theme), lead me to heartily recommend this bad boy!

Only the length of play and player count (best with the full compliment) prevents me from getting this to the table as often as I would like.  In saying this, it has become my 6 player strategy game of choice and I'm looking forward to the next game in the hope that my next crazy plan will be more effective than the one I tried this evening.

I'm willing to admit it's a bit longer than I'd like, but for me that's mainly because the length makes it harder to talk people into playing the game. 

First time players can come away with the impression that the cards are too chaotic for such a long game or that too much depends on the final scoring. Now that I've played a few games I think those first impressions are misleading. There aren't very many cards, so after a couple of games you can keep in mind the important ones that haven't hit yet and try to position yourself to grab them or mitigate their damage. 

Secondly, although a large fraction of the points are scored in the final round, the game is really about positioning yourself well to grab those points. Ideally you would stay within sight of the leader, avoiding too much attention from the other players. (There are a lot of opportunities to attack the leader.) Then, start preparing your positions a couple turns before the endgame to be ready to take full advantage of the final scoring opportunities that come your way. 

I think this is a game where skill allows you to make your own luck.

RATING: 9
1st play - 2 players, (Marlee) mammals vs. (me) arachnids.
The mammals dominated 196-169 pts.  This was so much fun!  There were definitely a few errors made during play that might have changed the whole flow of the game, but it was tremendously fun nonetheless.  I can't wait to play this again with new animals and more players.  Serious brain exercise!
---
2nd play - 2 players, (Mar) insects vs. (me) reptiles.
Insects win by a narrow thread, 232-222 pts!  I scored the maximum for domination through ice age at the end, but Marlee's survival bonus and 2 sea tiles wanderlusted at the end gave her the game.  This was all despite a very devastating Blight in the first round that put her in a foul mood the whole game and she accepted her defeat.  Until the final scoring of course.  Seriously fantastic game and we played with only one wrong rule this time!  (Not scoring the bonus for wanderlust).  I think it would have only secured her victory even more.  
Rating boost 9->10

4th play (3rd was incomplete) Mammals (Sean) vs. Birds (Me).
This game had some amazing twists and turns, devastating Domination cards, a relentless Glaciation that wiped out the majority of our cubes (mostly equally), and though it wasn't a close finish, it was a close game.  However, I did decide to drop this one to a 9 as a result. This game is just a little long (even having removed the action pawn related Dom cards) for what you get from it.  It's brilliant, but not perfect.

Dominant Species is a wonderful game that's hurt by all the tedious bookkeeping. On iOS it's fantastic, and takes at most 30 minutes. In person it takes at least 3 hours because every time an element on a tile changes you have to do some simple math. But there are a lot of tiles, so that math time adds up. I'm also not a huge fan of games where you have to ruin other people's games to win. You have to do that here. But it's a solid game through and through.

RATING: 6
On the good side:
Has plenty of depth and is a "gamer's game";
Has many alternative actions available to choose;
Is an interesting adaption of the Age of Empires action system;
Seems to be hard for anyone to run away with the lead if other players pay attention.

On the bad side:
The impact of the event cards seems overpowering relative to the rest of actions;
The calculation of dominance, scoring and projecting changes to those as a result of actions gets a bit tedious;
Arguably, too much depth as it feels more convoluted than AoE III for example;
Players can have strategic plans and execute tactical level actions, but the operational level in between is a challenge of managing turbulent processes and events that are hard to predict (which is where this differs from the 1830 family of games);
Need to be willing to commit a significant amount of time with the understanding that a couple event cards will likely determine who actually wins.

Ma przypiętą łatkę gry skomplikowanej i trudnej. Na wyrost! Główna trudność to świadome planowanie z wyprzedzeniem, a nie nawał czy abstrakcja reguł. Mechanika dość klasyczna - worker placement i area control, choć z kilkoma nowinkami (np. dominacja). Dużo interakcji, również wprost negatywnej. Sam temat i klimat dobrze oddany (np. postępujące zlodowacenie). Zniechęca mnie jedynie przydługi czas rozgrywki.

Some really interesting stuff, but toooo loooong. Worker-placement is a really crowded field, and Dominant Species suffers badly because the interesting bit (dominance) takes far too long to compute for too little payoff. You're better off with Tribune (or Agricola or Age of Empires). If you want a long and involved worker-placement odyssey, there's Mecanisburgo.
I really wanted to like this, given my great fondness for Combat Commander.

RATING: 9
Not overly complex by any means, but definitely super heavy. Due to the length of each game and the number of games that one must play in order to really begin to understand the future effects of every choice, DS is super heavy. I consider this and Nieuw Amsterdam to be my heaviest games.

While the dominance cards are powerful, a newbie mistake is to overestimate their power.

Big game in a really nice and sturdy box. The cover artwork looks fine, but once you see the other graphics you may ask yourself: "wtf happened?!"
This doesn't kill the game for me, but the difference is huge. Well, the 2nd edition seems to avoid this. :)

This game works great and is by no means a bad game, BUT there are things I just can't understand. Like the fact that a lucky player may be able to get the "new action pawn" card early in the game, while the other's don't. You can't do much if anything about it and that extra action is HUGE! This card problem reminds me of Railraod Tycoon and I know that many people had a problem with that system. There's even more luck working in this game, that MAY kill a players game.

The other problem is the playing time. This game can take ages and most of the time you will have to wait for your turn, as other players may have changed the whole board until then.

Away from that, it's a great, heavy game with easy to understand rules. Really, this is a monster of a game, but the short rules are very clear and that's very impressive.

Have only played it a few times but its great.  The game has a lot of depth, but the rules once learned are fairly simple.  The game has great interaction between players which I love and a lot to consider.

Real fun, real well designed, and looks great.  The time range of 2-4 hours could definitely be shorter as it is largely dependent on how long people take to think while placing their action pawns.  If you play with some slow movers it could surely be 4 hours or longer.  However, if you play with some quick choosers you could probably do a game in 1-1.5 hours.

The only thing that is a bit tiresome about the game is constantly re-calculating dominance, but I suppose you could only do this prior to the dominance phase.  But when doing it this way it would be easy to make an error and miss changes.  Might be a bit hard to get non-gamers to play due to the numerous rules, but if you could get them through a turn it should be fine.

Overall great game and great theme.

Only downside I see is the large learning curve and reluctance you get with it from people (family) not as open to such barriers of entry.

Revision: Do not play this with people who take a long time to make decisions, it will drag into the 5 hour range.  This also makes it quite a bit less enjoyable.

RATING: 10
A game I always want to play. It takes a few plays to really grasp how the game fits together as a whole but after that it is worth all the effort. Reading the board, grasping the significance of the scoring system (knowing that those ahead on the score are not necessarily the ones in the best winning position for instance) as well as the impact of the dominance cards is important to get the best out of it.

The game is far less chaotic than it appears at first sight but that does mean you need to think into the other players board positions rather than simply play your own game. This is really a Wargame with Euro selection mechanics, to play it any other way will probably result in disappointment.

Chad Jensen does it again.  This is probably one of the deepest area control games I have ever played.  Unfortunately I have not played it since a terrible game of it in a tournament at PrezCon.

I need to play this one for fun again, to get that sour taste out of my mouth for this game that tournament left.

A lot to like here.  Age of empires meets el grande, with a hint of primordial soup flavor.  The multiple levels of area majority combined with the use of previous player actions to generate events feels pretty unique, even though you can clearly see the influence of other games.  

Even taking that praise into account, it seemed a little process heavy and in need of streamlining.  I want to play again, and when I do the score could drop or raise by a point.

I really like this game - good level of interaction and lots of tough choices. You need to be able to make the most of the special abilities of your animal type and optimize your play while the situation on the game board constantly changes and the other players try to screw you over.

The rules are clearly written and I find that I can easily get an overview of the different choices available to me during the planning phase. 

Unfortunately most of the players I have played with so far have been a little overwhelmed and thus the game has dragged on a little too long. Would rate it higher if it played quicker!

Variable players powers, but balanced.  Continuous area-control fighting with no random chance.  It may be the euro-gamer's ideal game.

Fantastic game, very thematic feel.
Very interactive, and With worker placement mechnanism as well as area control. Can be very confrontational,  and I view it almost as a war game in disguise. The wargame background of the designer shines through.  

Replayability is almost endless with assymetric abilities of the different amimals. Some of the Cards are really powerful and can cause huge swings in momentum. Can feel somewhat chaotic at times due to the the interaction between the players. 

Lots of depth, and think I will need a lot more games to explore various strategies.

Just finished my first game of DS and it lasted 7 straight hours! Not to mention that it was only a 3 player game! 

The game itself is fantastic but it's way too long if you don't impose some kinda time limit. I finished my turn in 30 seconds most of the time but for some people who tend to overthink, one single turn could last 5 minutes or more. 

Also GMT should include 8 or 10-sided dice for each player to mark their matching points on every tile. That would save a lot of AP problems

One of the most brain draining game I played to date !

Players each given a species at random, each with special abilities which will help in the game.

Players take turns selecting action they want to take and resolves one by one. I would say this game involves strategy, math skills (counting domination of an area tile) and sweet talking to other players to play/not to play catastrophie cards! YES there is a card called catastropy which kills everyone!

I rate this game highly because of its cleverly designed APs and involves thinking. However be prepared for lot of brain draining!

Good game in many ways. However I'm not very fond of random and highly differently severe cards coming into play to potentially bring huge impact into the end of each round. You can always try to plan for things, but there are too many factors that will eventually sabotage your plans one way or another.

RATING: 8
A terrific worker-placement, action selection game, that nicely models the inter-species competition it portrays.

The cubes, cylinders and cones Euro-ize it considerably, so it doesn't seem very animal-specific, but the competition mechanisms and the swings as well as opportunities seem very strong, and fairly varied.

Getting more actions early-on was the biggest swing in my one play; first species to 4 really built out a lead (which was surpassed in play) but which propelled it to the final victory.

This one gets an 8 on a 1st play, and I expect more to follow when I can budget the loooong chunk of time needed to pull it out again.

despite the long play time it keeps me intrested the whole time, which is not an achievement for a 60 minute game but for one that takes three times as long it is. everything in the game is important and you can't ignore anything. if you play it with people who know it the time flies. if new players join it can drag on a bit but if there are questions anything can be found in the excellent rulebook.

This is a new game from GMT and Chad Jensen.  The world is too chaotic for long range planning, but that's part of the fun.  Trying to guide your animal to be the most dominant at the end of the game by adapting to Earth's elements, evolving into new species, migrating to new parts of the world, etc... and dodging all the chaos is what makes this game so much fun.

RATING: 9
(12/17/10): Intriguing "survival of the fittest" type game, where you try to gain dominance in specific terrain in the ever expanding map board. Players alternate and reserve up to four-five (dependent on number of players) specific actions on a flow-chart-like action menu. There are only so many spots available for each action, and each action is resolved from top to bottom, starting with turn-order jockeying, mutation, regression, glaciation, migration, competition, and other steps that mimic the evolutionary process.

There are several other "evolution" type games that play in a much shorter time, as this plays in four-five hours! However, the level of detail in this game that each turn entails is fascinating, as one can watch the rise and fall of a variety of species. Rating: '7'.

Update (02/21/11): It's been two months and it hasn't seen the table since. As several others agree, after a long period to digest our first game, it is simply exhausting to think about playing this again, as it is tedious, complex, and dreadfully long for the payoff. Intriguing as I may have sounded that night, in hindsight, I was hoping the game would accelerate and come to a swift conclusion, but it didn't. It dragged on and on, with one or two hexes being laid out each turn. Every turn was the same monotonous cycle of putting out fires, managing adversity, and mitigating disasters, with little, if any visibility into (or hope for) the future for a long term strategy. I'd watch my herds grow, only to have them decimated either by other players or by random elements of the game, particularly the dominance cards, which seemed realistic, but not enjoyable. Somewhere halfway through the game we began to understand how to use our specie's special powers, but by then we just wanted it to end. Only with one to two turns did it become evident that dominance of the tundra, and earning the right to select the dominance cards, were keys to winning. Until the final turns, we were simply treading water. It will be awhile before we revisit this.

Update (01/24/2015) 4 plays: It has been nearly [i]four[/i] years of begging and pleading by one of the members of my group to bring this to the table. The first game was the same painful exercise in futility, taking 4 hours. We thought it would be another several years before this came back, but the very next day we played it again. This time, being ever vigilant (calling "Time!" if any player started to pause to think, or to start commenting on something), we managed to finish a 3-player game in 2 hrs 5 minutes! This time, concentrating on the dominance cards and Wanderlust, I managed to do well enough to enjoy myself. Also, the game went quicker, because we were doing dominance every turn. Once we accepted that there would be many "take that" moments, and that our herds would get decimated here and there, it became enjoyable. It is not for the faint of heart, as it is a particularly nasty game that awards aggressive play. Over the past four years, I have gained an appreciation for heavier and heavier games. So, this is starting to interest me, enough that I may (gasp) consider buying it. Raising it to an "8".

Update (03/12/2017) 5+ plays: Bought it, love it. The people that love it, love it, and the people that hate it, continue to hate it. I've taught a number of newbies since then, and all agree this is a very good game. In teaching, I've emphasized on getting the dominance cards--this forces players to really examine the dominance cards, thus eliminating surprises, and actually speeds the game at a reasonable rate. Raising it to a "9".

Ultimately my favorite game. You can try to get your head around this one, but it is impossible, however, the best player is always the winner and you can see what he did right in that exact game and what others did not do right. By the end of each of our games everyone is standing around the table, everyone excited to see what happens next. Only one downside, which is also the force of the game, it is a long and heavy game - this makes the game very tense by the ending, but also difficult to get to the table.

Interesting game, if a bit overwhelming, but it seems that the cards are so powerful they can dwarf all the other actions.  This just doesn't seem to fit the mood of the rest of the game.  This is based on only 1 play, so maybe it's naive.

Worker-placement in itself is an interesting mechanism, but unfortunately almost every new game seems to have the need to incorporate it. So I grew tired of it, and the sparc between Dominant Species and I just did not want to fly...

I like it but it feels slightly too convoluted.  I agree with the comparison to AoE3 & El Grande & I prefer those due to their accessibility where more attention can be spent on planning winning moves than remembering rules & reading cards.

There was a fair amount of multiplayer chaos (similar to the games mentioned above) but I don't have a problem with that.


The components & board look great & are very functional.

Esperando ansioso la llegada
18/mayo/2011 28 días de espera, por fin llego y a jugar se ha dicho, of course en un solo para degustar este juegazo y poder posteriormente enseñarlo como es debido, jugados solo primeros dos turnos, muy bueno
29/Mayo/2011 sube a 10, excelente juego, muy bien balanceado, de reglas sencillas y mucha profundidad, lo cual me hacia bajarle el puntaje, era el tiempo de juego, pero estas tan involucrado y en sobrevivir y dominar que practicamente el tiempo no se nota, no hay tiempos muertos. 
30/may/2012 mientras jugaba con GI, Jorge y Andrés, GI me lo compro, en $30.000, sigue siendo uno de mis favoritos, pero puedo jugarlo poco, igual me dio pena venderlo, pero voy por la tercera edición, estaba falto de $$ por la compora de Eclipse!!

Really a worker placement and area majority game, but the dominance cards throw such a lot of chaos and direct attacks into the mix that whether you succeed or not is mostly in the hands of others. I wouldn't want to play this with more than 4 again, as the player going last can't take adaptations, nor advance along the initiative track if the others take these choices first (and it's entirely sensible that they should). The game's length is further extended by a vulnerability to over-analysis, putting this way over a sensible playing time for the chaos factor involved.

Wow. There's a lot going on here.  Each player has a particular power and a particular place in the turn order (which can, however, be changed over the course of the game). Then there's a worker-placement game and, underneath it all, an area control game.  There's also some card drafting involved. So there are many different elements, and taking them all into account in one's strategy over the course of this four (or so) hour game is pretty challenging.  There's enough scope in the game for a lot of back-and-forth--a player can have it all wrapped up only to lose a lot of ground in a single bad turn.  The end result is satisfying and complex and, um, really long.  Fatigue set in after the first few hours, which tempered my satisfaction a little bit. It hangs together really well for what it is, but I couldn't play it very often. (1 play)

When I first played it, it blew my mind away to be honest.

So many options to choose from, the mechanics is so different than all those games out there! Oh and the pieces, so colourful, so cute! (Haha, can't think of a better description.)

Every class of animal plays differently, and a 2 player game is different than a 4 player game, and those games are different than a 6 player mayhem!

Some might have complained about the lack of control about the game in high player count, but that's exactly why I love the 6 player games! It's a tough world out there, we cannot control everything, but we can take the best out of what we have.

Some might have complained about the long play time. My girlfriend told me this, which I completely agree upon. "Even the game lasted 2-3 hours, I... don't feel devastated. My brain is not burned like after playing Sid Meier's Civilization." Besides, if it really took TOO long for your taste, you can always take away 5 dominance cards, or even 10. You will still have a quick fun game.

Every person's action has impact on everyone, the high amount of interaction keeps everyone engaged. Cut-throat element is gorgeous. I also love the big swing at the end, it very often comes up with some pleasantly surprising results!

If you love strategic game, you don' want to miss this one! One of the best games I have ever played!

RATING: 10
This is my number one favorite game.  Its long but it completely satisfies my Gaming Quotient (GD = Game Enjoyment/Time Playing).  The game has a simple yet complex action selection mechanism that drives the game. There is a nice balance of multiple strategies which are dynamic with the way the events come out and how the players develop the board.  There are player boards that are slightly asymmetric, but none of them dictate your strategy they only enhance your tactical decision to get where the game leads. The margins in score are often large but the game is still close.  One of the nice elements is that you can have all of your early game pieces eliminated and still recover and move to victory with solid play.  The choices in this game are deep and rich.  I have played this game at all players counts, I prefer 4-6 players and I find this game very engaging as there are many meaningful things to think about even while waiting for 5 other players to make their action selections.  I have several friends that prefer the game at 3 players and I wont argue when we can just start playing.

RATING: 8
"El Grande: Versión del director". Un juego de mayorías con muchos más añadidos que obligan al jugador a prestar mucha atención al desarrollo de la partida. Añade la interacción de Die Macher al sistema de puntuación de El Grande, junto con la colocación de trabajadores de Caylus o Agricola y cierto toque de evolución que podemos encontrar en Primordial Soup.

En Dominant Species, (DS), cada jugador toma el rol de uno de los 6 animales del juego: mamíferos, reptiles, pájaros, anfibios, arácnidos o insectos. La tierra está dividida en hexágonos que representan el mar, humedales, la sabana, junglas, bosques, desiertos, montañas y, cuando se acerca la edad de hielo, la tundra. En cada vértice, se sitúan los "elementos", unas piezas de cartón con forma de círculo que representan lo que los animales necesitan para sobrevivir: carne, sol, semillas, agua, larvas y, por último, hierba. Conforme el juego progresa, la tierra conocida va aumentando, se añaden nuevos elementos al tablero y los animales tienen que adaptarse a ello.

Cada animal (cada jugador), tiene un poder especial que no se altera durante toda la duración de la partida, pero los elementos que necesita para sobrevivir si pueden (y deben) evolucionar durante la misma. También hay tres tipos de piezas de madera: los cilindros que son los "puntos de acción".Se usarán para seleccionar las acciones que cada jugador quiera realizar.

Los cubos representan las "especies", digamos la cantidad de población de ese animal en concreto que ocupa un hexágono y los conos de madera representarán la "dominancia", que es un concepto del juego que representa la adaptación de un animal en concreto al terreno que ocupa. Esto se calcula en función de la cantidad de elementos (hierba, sol, larvas...) que haya en los vértices del hexágono que coincidan con los que tenga el animal en cuestión.

Lo importante de esto es lo siguiente: un animal NO domina un terreno por tener la mayor cantidad de especies (cubitos) en él, sino por tener la mayor capacidad de desenvolverse en él, que viene determinada por ser el que tenga mayor cantidad de elementos coincidentes con los del terreno (el mejor adaptado para desarrollarse en él).

El juego, en esencia, es una combinación de dos mecánicas que me encantan: la colocación de trabajadores con la de mayorías. Hay que conseguir la mayor cantidad de PV´s antes de que llegue la edad de hielo (representada por la última carta que entra en juego durante la partida). 

El núcleo del juego es el menú de acciones que hay en el tablero, que es enorme. Hay un límite de puntos de acción que pueden entrar en determinado lugar, así que, al no haber espacio para todos los jugadores, el orden de turno es importante.Sin entrar demasiado en la explicación, algunas de estas acciones son:

Adaptación: (añades un elemento a tu tablero de animales), Abundancia (añades un elemento a una loseta de terreno), Glaciación (transformas un terreno en tundra), Speciation, (añades nuevas especies -cubos- al tablero), Wanderlust (añades una loseta de terreno nuevo al tablero, Migración (mueves especies por el tablero), Competición (las especies pelean entre sí y se eliminan), Dominación (el jugador anota puntos por tener la mayoría de especies en determinada loseta, habiendo PV´s, en general, para el 2º y 3º). Además, la acción de Dominación, entrega al jugador que tenga dominancia en la loseta que se puntúa, una carta que suele dar una ventaja: acciones extra, desgracias que puedes hacer a los demás...

Las mecánicas del juego, como vemos no son complejas. El menú de acciones disponibles es muy claro y cada acción "per sé" no es difícil. Pero entender las implicaciones de una acción es dónde reside lo verdaderamente intrincado del juego. Además hay dos sistemas de mayorías: el control del área (que da PV´s al que más cubitos -especies- tenga en el hexágono) y la "aptitud del área" (que premia al jugador que se encuentra mejor adaptado para desarrollarse en el área, es decir a aquél que tenga mayor coincidencia con los elementos mostrados en los vértices del hexágono).

Por si fuera poco, hay otros métodos de conseguir PV´s, como son colocar nuevos terrenos gracias a la acción de Wanderlust o Glaciación. Por último, tienes una reserva de cubitos que es limitada y que puede agotarse antes de que termine el juego si no lo gestionas bien. Añadir que debes prestar atención al orden de acciones dado que una acción previa puede anular el efecto de una acción posterior. No es que haya sorpresas gracias al azar, sino que hay que seguir muy de cerca las acciones y su orden o te sorprenden (generalmente de forma bastante desagradable).

PROS:  La Glaciación. Una mecánica que me encanta. Si alguien me preguntara: "¿Qué es lo que hace DS que no haga El Grande?", sin duda contestaría con:"La Glaciación". Esta mecánica hace que todo el mundo ande de puntillas con cierta tensión y, con frecuencia, te obliga a tomar decisiones desagradablemente duras (¿Coloco este elemento cerca de la tundra para tener más posibilidades de supervivencia, o por el contrario lo alejo de ella para encontrarme más seguro?). Además, otorga cierto arco argumental al juego (inicio-nudo-desenlace) y genera un mecanismo de buenas oportunidades para remontar la partida.

Combina muy bien aspectos estratégicos en las acciones de Especiación /Wanderlust /Glaciación /Adaptación con aspectos más tácticos de la dominancia y migración. 

Reglamento clarísimo y con ejemplos aclaratorios. Creo que incluso mejor redactado que el de Through the Ages.

CONS: Si esperas un juego con animeeples de 60-90 min. de mecánicas sencillas y comportamiento predecible, no es tu juego. Esto le hace ver muy poca mesa.

Hay mucha variabilidad que puede no gustar: inicio asimétrico gracias a los distintos poderes de cada especie, tablero variable, situación variable de recursos, árbol de decisiones enorme debido a la colocación de los peones de acción en las acciones... Esto genera excesivo Análisis Parálisis (AP), así que recomiendo encarecidamente olvidarle si hay algún jugador que tienda a ello, aunque sea mínimamente. El juego se convierte en una tortura. En un festival del AP

Además, hay mucha agresión e interacción, muy poco habitual en los juegos de este estilo, y pudiera ser que no gustara a todos los jugadores.

En general, para muchos jugadores es un juego que exige mucho más de lo que te da.

This is by far my all time favorite game. Such a gorgeous game board and artwork, it may be the most ingeniously designed board game I have ever seen and played. The game play is flawless and so carefully thought out that it seems like nothing is missed. INCREDIBLE! I can't say enough about it. There is some "screwing another player" factor in this game. So, people who don't like a certain level of player interaction might not love it as much as I do. So if your looking for a gamer's game with plenty of player interaction you NEED this game! This game always gets broken out. Such a great game.

Solo per gamers incalliti. Non proponetelo ai giocatori occasionali, se non volete rischiare di allontanarli per sempre dai boardgame.

After finally managing to play Dominant Species in under four hours, I feel comfortable giving it a 10.  There's nothing I don't love about this game.  It's one of the few games that keeps me completely absorbed for the entire run, impressive considering its length.  Others have labeled this "brain burning," but I generally have not felt that way about it - yes, it is heavy, and yes, there are many moving parts, so many that it's almost guaranteed that something obvious (in hindsight) will completely blindside you sometime during the game, but I find the experience exhilarating rather than draining. After playing it a few times, what I've come to appreciate about it most is the constant tension between the short-term tactical game and the long-term strategic game.  This is a common feature of many great games (i.e. Agricola) but Dominant Species really takes it to the next level with the Dominance Cards (and by extension, the constant need to maintain Dominance somewhere on the board); what cards are available on a given turn can completely turn the game on a dime and force everyone to readjust on the fly while still trying to maintain some semblance of the long game. Combine this with the constantly changing board and its tendency to mess up whatever plan you originally had when you placed your Action Pawns, and you have a roller coaster ride of a game that does not let up for a minute.  Perhaps the most amazing thing about Dominant Species is how simple the rules are and how much depth and complexity the game can wring from them; the brain-burning comes from your opponent's actions and their effects on your plans, not from pages and pages of chrome. Not for the fainthearted or conflict-averse, Dominant Species is an absolute beast of a game, and an absolute joy to play.

Dominant Species incorporates biology excellently into its game mechanics. Speciate, adapt, migrate ... the terms actually do what you would expect through the verb. This game plays well with 3-6, and competition is steep regardless of the species chosen. Delicate alliances of convenience must be formed, or your species will be pushed further into its niche - and eventually into extinction.

Fun game, but everyone in my group loves it in the beginning and hates it by the end.  Very aggressive, which isn't a problem, but the game -really- slows down late when you have to be re-evaluating every tile multiple times per turn.  Too much counting and assessing and not enough time doing the fun things.

Wow... Worker placement, area control, LOTS of choices which have profound effects on not only your position but potentially everyone else's as well.  The only downsides are a huge potential for analysis paralysis and a bit long playing time, but overall one of my favorite games this year.  Don't listen to the haters on the bits, anything more than what's there would just be distracting.  My only complaint on the bits is that they are much too easy to move and mess up the board while playing, I'm going to have to think of something to help with that.

I LOVE this game!  I almost could assert that Dominant Species is THE perfect board game, however I cannot give it a 10 in good conscience because the game takes a substantially long time to play and there is significant barrier to entry for most new-ish gamers.  Non-gamers have no business playing this monster.  The theme of animals vying for dominance in an interesting, varied and dynamic landscape comprised of numerous terrain types shortly before the dawn of an ice age comes alive through brilliant mechanics.  Players will deploy their animals strategically on different terrain hexes, modify their animals' ability to flourish in diverse environments, alter the environment on the terrain hexes so that they will be more amenable to their own species and less amenable to other players' species, and even kill other players' animals.  Dominant species combines several ideas established in previous games such as the area majority scoring from El Grande and the worker placement action selection from Stone Age into a brain burning masterpiece.  With twelve interesting and strongly thematic different actions to choose from, Analysis Paralysis (AP) struck early and often.   I do not mind AP; it often indicates that players are challenged to make stimulating choices on heir turn, which is a characteristic I want embossed into every game I play.  Dominant Species is a mean and nasty game that affords players several novel and stimulating means of wrecking other players such as: commanding the mighty power of a glacier that road grades unwary animals one hex per round, invoking ecological disaster to strike where your opponent would like it least, benefit from sundry supremely powerful evolutionary adaptations.  I can't gush enough about how well designed this game is, how mentally stimulating it is and how much fun it is to play.  It is so mentally taxing that at times you wonder if you are at work solving important technical problems, yet the game is such a blast.  Dominant Species is a thrill ride that I found so enjoyable, I couldn't feel upset as another player delivered a devastating, crushing blow that wiped me entirely off the face of the Earth on the second round, which wasn't the end of the world or the end of the game for me because I could simply have new species emerge the following turn. If you are a serious tabletop gamer looking for an epic gaming experience, seek this game out.

A wonderful mishmash of high-end game mechanics placed into a game theme that appeals to me.

Part area control, part worker placement, part resource management.

It took a game or two to really understand the value of each of the action choices  (in terms of manipulating the board) and the importance of several of the domination cards.  And my sense is that I will play this game many more times and still have plenty to learn.

If I have a knock against it, it is that the frustration quotient can be quite high when you are not in position to stop someone from running away, and those that *can* do something do nothing to stop it, instead remembering you ate one of their bugs earlier.

A typical area control game. Dominant Species has successfully combined with scientific theme. The game proceeds as following biological evolutionary phenomenon. This game is very logical, educational and provides dynamic interaction among players. However, the game has too many complicate details. Moreover, this game takes very long time. Usually, 4 players needs 4 hours to enjoy one single game. It is certain that Dominant Species give players a lot of fun and strategic varieties. Though, it is very complicated with its rule details which makes game too long. For this reason, I prefer El Grande, Samurai and San Marco, such like classical area contol games. In my opinion, these classical area influence games offers similar fun with Dominant Species in game mechanic and less downtime. If I choose to play area control games, I would rather not to select Dominant Species, but other classical area control games.

One play with 6 at GMT West.  We had two experienced players, which helped a lot, but the rest of us picked it up fairly well.  Not a game you're likely to win the first time you play, but one you can enjoy right away.  Everyone had a lot of fun.

Dominant Species can be mind-meltingly tough, but one cannot help but appreciate how beautifully it's put together. There are a lot of moving parts and a lot of things to keep in your head as the game plays out, but it all goes very smoothly and is really a pleasure to play. But, oh, it can be so nasty.

The only thing keeping it from a 10 for me is the utter strength of the Domination cards.  They're just a bit too strong, and they can cause huge swings in the game, obliviating any and all long-term strategy.

Je pourrais dire qu'une chance j'ai vu la modification de mettre des dés afin de mieux visualiser qui domine sur les hex car je pense que je trouverais ça long sans ça.  J'ai acheté des d10 de chaque couleurs des animaux et quand je place des espèces je place des des donc je peux voir qui est en avance et qu'est-ce qui manque aux autres pour dépasser c'est beaucoup plus facile comme ça.  Une dizaine de dés par espèce ça fait l'affaire.  On a plus un belle vue d'ensemble.  Bon jeu avec cette méthode sinon un casse trop lourd.  À trois joueurs j'ai encore un peut de place sur les hex.  Le jeu devient plus rapide aussi.

Dominant Species comes in a sturdy box, which is needed to hold all of that cardboard and timber! The design of the rulebook, board and other components is functional rather than aesthetic. Top marks for the rules, which are straightforward and very well-written. The game itself offers nothing very original in terms of individual mechanics, but is remarkable for its overall complexity - particularly in the sheer number of choices available to players. The many options can lead to a lot of downtime due to analysis and result in the game being rather too long given what it offers (there is barely any narrative development over the course of play and forward planning is difficult). Still, if you are prepared for the long haul then it can be a great gaming experience. One element of Dominant Species that does detract a little from it being a heavyweight gamer's game is the variability of the dominance cards, but this can be offset with some house rules.

RATING: 4
Far too long (4+ hours) for the payoff, and we played with the variant that pulled  the action-adding cards.  Dear god, how long would this have been with them?

It seems like its got alot of moving parts, but the end-game scoring is all that really matters...I lost by 2 points at the end.

Chaos reigns.  I'm not looking for euro-chaos in a 4 hour game.  I'm looking for a sound rules-system that allows for solid choices to be rewarded and poor choices to be punished.  This game doesn't provide for either.

Highly, highly disappointed.

So far games have lasted much less than the advertised  and dreaded 4 hours. Havent yet played with the full complement though. If there is a downside with the game it is that its sometimes hard to introduce to people because it is very involved. Takes a lot of time 2,5-3 hours seems to be the average for me. Also it can be hard for people to grasp workable strategies until they've played it a couple of times.

Probably the best game of the half dozen or so designs on this subject.  I definitely also see the El Grande parallels -- a good thing in my book.  That said there is some real chaos, and it's a touch long.  But I can see finding an 8 in this ambitious design.  Lots of variability for sure.

Multi-dimensional area control. The cards may seem unbalanced at first, but I don't think they really are. Totally captures the core biological tradeoff of specialization vs. adaptability! A bit long for what it is, but that's helped immensely with the designer's suggested game-shortening variant.

Splendid.  Totally immersive game - smart, elegant and close to brilliant.  Great ideas in the rules - very thematic and integrated into the game in an excellent way.

Extremely clean rules for such a heavy game.

One of the most vicious games I've ever played.

--

Avoid the 5-player mode.  Too little control and only 4 action pawns to forge your destiny.  In contrast there are 5 action pawns with 4 players and 6 with 3 players.  Not only you feel like you want to do more/more types of actions, but addtionally this scarcity of APs gives you even less control (performing 4/20 of actions in a turn vs 5/20 of actions in 4-player mode vs 6/18 of actions in 3-player mode)…

RATING: 8
Wow what an ambitious and viscious game. Screwage in a way that would even make Kramer blush...lol well, maybe not but it sounded good. Really its a Euro, a themactic one but its one no doubt and laregly a Weuro at the same time, who knew Chad had it in him.

Kind of feels like AOEIII(worker placement similiarity) combined with Kramer's Wildlife (Theme, AC), at least that would be the easiest way to summarize it. Even if not entirely accurate if you like those two games you're in for a treat. 

Definitely some chaos and/or PIC present (not surprising considering the creator) with the large screwage elements, but it sure does make its way around. I was a little perturbed as everytime I setup a nice scoring area it got wiped out by a Tundra but I guess that's the point, Animals fighting over everything and the experienced player I was playing with knew enough to cut down bigger scoring chances. At any rate, I think I'll stick to 3 players for added control and game length though I'd try 4 once anyway, 6 player would be insane.

So if your comfortable with that kind of thing (like the Castillo in El Grande for example) then there is a lot to like in DS. A very thematic game where Area Control and Area Dominance (slightly different and a pain to constantly calculate with the dynamic boardstate) are both important and a very well done worker placement phase determines how the board will change. Very strategic and still largely tactical, you know mostly what things are coming up and the timing of them, the things you don't know though have to be adapted to and thanks to the order these actions take place, adapting is possible mostly IF somewhat anticipated. Even some of the things you do know, you DON'T know HOW they will be implemented, or where etc so count on some of your planning NOT turning out so well. This will make some pretty uncomfortable incl me, more experience will likely help, like in a game of Maharaja where anticipating is a BIG part of the game. 

I have to say it is fun to smash down a big populated territory you're not on. The ever changing board is somewhat of a marvel to watch. The varible powers asymetrical and interesting. Multiple ways to score with Tundra scoring becoming more and more important, this really ramps up the intensity and creates a nice arcing game as the Glacier spreads. Length easily modifed by playing a set number of rounds or removing some cards, though there could be some balance implications with that. I wonder if getting an extra "worker" early on is too powerful, especially compared to someone who doesn't get one at all or really late, almost has to be so probably good cards to remove to shorten the game, 2 birds. Overall very engaging, probably too long, chaotic BUT in a Kramer kind of way I believe, really want/need to play again soon. Rating could go up if strategies can indeed be executed with some amount of control but will likely stay at 8 or close for me. 

Oh, I'd put a picture in my comments too, but, nahh, what a way to clutter up the comments pages (imagine if we all started that, why? its a [i]comments[/i] section), really they belong in the reviews and PICTURES section anyway.  Edit - Ah hell if you can't beat em...

I should love this: worker placement + area control + theme. But the design is clunky, in that it's a kitchen sink. It could do with 1/2 the mechanics. And those mechanics all come at a significant cognitive cost. It's not clear that that additional cost actually buys me any extra enjoyment, or challenge. Feld can get away with mechanics-mashups because his games don't overstay their time on the table. Doing it in a game of this length (in my experience, anyway) is nearly cruel.

Take this review with a grain of salt as I've only played it once, and possibly with the wrong group, but I found this to be a 5 hour analysis-paralysis fest. Every turn a player agonized over what action to take to score one additional point, only to have a action card eventually come up that swinged the scoring 20 points the other way. I think that Dominant Species is intellectually a very good game, and I understand why other people like it, but I would rather get punched in the testicles by Mike Tyson than play it again.

RATING: 4
Bearing in mind that I do not like area control or tactical games, I can cope just about with most of that in this game given that it comes with a lot of mechanichs that I typically enjoy (all the euro style mechanics that govern how the game plays). 

There is just too much going on to even have the slightest hope in anticpating what other players are going to do combined with what chits come out each round, so often you just have to make a good move at the time and hope.

The cards can be brutal/amazing/uninspiring depending on the game state, and unfortunately a little bit swingy.

Other than the cards, it's an excellent game, just not for me.

Pros: streamlined play, consistent rules, fun theme, nice board and bits (although it would be cool if it had species bits, not just cubes.)

Cons: Chaotic, kingmakery, chit pulls too important, endgame drag with finding best places to max VPs.

Takes a game to get the hang of everything--how things work and interrelate, what's important, knowing the cards. Everything makes "sense" at the very least.

Might play again, but not looking forward to it. Too long for such chaos. I'd certainly play better though.

Dominant Species is right at the limit for what I enjoy in a game when it comes to game length, aggressive interactions, and sweeping thematic events disrupting gameplay. I'm glad I'm fine with those qualities here, because Dominant Species is an exciting game full of tense decisions and clever design ideas. I especially enjoy the complexity of dealing with competing to select actions before they are carried out and dealing with the two forms of area control on each board space. It's an excellent choice for gamers itching for an intense and epic battle.

A game with some nice parts, which initially seemed great.

However, the on-going calculations for dominance are a bit of a pain.  

The final scoring is awful, being largely calculable before the last couple of moves of the game - but those calculations taking so long that for a player to play optimally they should take the 5-10 minutes needed to do the maths, and then choose their move; then the next player should do the same etc...  I don't think I'd want to play the full game again, as I feel (I mostly do maths for a living) that I should be paid to play it.

And being pedantic - it's not a great match between theme and mechanics

First impressions after one game.

Some good stuff, but ultimately the game lies *way* over my tolerance threshold for arbitrary "screw you!" abilities, considering how long and analytical it otherwise is.

An uncomfortable hybrid of a dry, Caylus-like eurogame and an old-school AT "take that!" game, it falls between two chairs for me: I think the designer should have either toned down the dryness, making it more of a pure whinefest-style game, OR should have made it a game where your carefully laid plans stand a chance against the arbitrary strikes of the other players.

As it is, spending a lot of effort carefully formulating a plan, only to have to take off most of your action pawns unused, because the other players decided to target you exclusively this turn, is immensely frustrating.

Excellent, excellent game! Super simple rules that lead to some very tough decisions! Very aggressive. Every choice you make can make big, sweeping changes to the board that affect the game for a long time. 

I feel like the play time has been hugely over-reported. No game I've played has taken more than about 2h45. If it's taking your group four or five hours to play, then I think they're just WAY overthinking it. The game is all about getting BIG turns. There is some strategy, and there can be some big swings in endgame scoring, but I think the game is all about maximizing every point you can get this turn because there's honestly no telling what the next turn will bring! Half of your species might be entirely wipred out by then!

Relatively meaty, but not as much as some people seem to think.  The random factors consist of what cards come out and what people do... but people do so much stuff, you need to just go with the flow of the game and focus on the big picture rather than looking at every single consequence of what you do; because everything else will be different.  Focus on the big ones, play around what the cards may do to you, and try and score points.  Much easier than some people make it out to be.  This is not a 5+ hour game.

Brilliant game, with more plays I believe it will crack my top 10 of favorite games.
This gem has the best aspects from 2 great games, Agricola (worker placement) and El Grande (Area control) creating a truly marvelous game.

The good: The game is a little complex (which I love) thus it requires a deep strategy, despite that the game runs smoothly and completely in synch with the theme (which is great). Each species has one key advantage making each game different.  The game is so well designed that everything is interrelated in the game; every choice counts and has a deep impact in in your survival. Totally absorbing.


The bad: The long play time makes hard for this game to hit the table more often. The components serve their purpose but I think they could have been prettier. 

In conclusion a truly gamer´s game and a must have for me.

Sadly, I haven’t played Dominant Species as much as I wanted to. I still think this is a great game and won’t say no to a play of this.  The game has a lot of stuff going on, very deep and meaty. You don’t even feel the time when playing this so the long play time doesn’t bug me. A truly gem and the game that put Chad Jensen in my radar.

After more plays I’m enjoying Dominant Species less and less. I have changed a lot during these years and I no longer enjoy the “take that” mechanism and Dominant Species has it in spades. Most players attack the perceived leader but sometimes they attack the weakest one as well because the retaliation is less dangerous.

With 6 players the game is too slow for me. I think its sweet spot is 4 players.

I still recognize that Dominant Species is a solid game and it is still among my favorite games, but it has fallen a lot for me.

One of 2010 favorites.

I didn't like many of the earlier generations of area control games.  El Grande, for example, I rate highly out of respect than enthusiasm.  I find myself getting too invested in the areas I'm trying to score and annoyed with the extreme focus on positioning and timing.

Both Chaos in the Old World and Dominant Species get past this by adding another dimension of area control.  I'm frankly stunned that the solution to what I dislike about area control games is more area control.

In Dominant Species, the tension is between cube majorities, which affect the scoring, and "dominance," which is based on a set of up to six elements that are represented on one's player card and have matching symbols on the board.  This represents how well an animal is adapted to the resources a particular tile supplies.  Of course these resources can become more abundant or depleted through player actions.

The two-dimensional area control system makes for a much more engaging game than the old one-dimensional models, which tend to get static as players become entrenched.  It's difficult to become entrenched in Dominant Species, and even when one is entrenched on a particular tile the expanding glacier can swallow up the tile, making it near-worthless for scoring purposes.  Even then there is an interesting subgame regarding placement on tundra tiles that can yield big points over repeated turns.

I appreciate games with many paths to victory, and Dominant Species seems to deliver on that score.  In two games I've seen the following strategies pursued to some success:  aggressive glaciation, spreading and dominating low-scoring tiles for a big final domination score, under-speciating early so as to place cubes with impunity and make a big final turn score, survival, and attrition by depleting other players' cube supplies (which is basically a more aggressive variant of under-speciating).  It bodes extremely well that all of these strategies seem viable.

I'm already finding the permutations easier to calculate after two games; by five games in I'm hoping they become second nature.  My real concern is the game length and complexity.  I love heavy and epic games, so a 4-hour game doesn't bother me [i]per se[/i], but Dominant Species is an extremely busy game, with a lot of decisions and calculations to make.  As such it leaves me with a massive headache afterwards.  I can only hope this effect dissapates after a few games.  It will remain difficult, but not impossible, to fit in games of DS given my current life situation.

A strong 8, with room for improvement if it delivers as I expect it to over the next few plays.

Edit (7-22-12):  Finally completed 2 games.  We only used one animal each and half of the cards for our 2-player games.  Length of the game seemed about right for us.  Think we might really like this for a more meaty game.

Ended up trading it away.  My gamer friend has a copy, so I can still play it.  Best with 4.

RATING: 7.5
Updated rating to a 9 after first 4 player game. I don't think I'll want to play this as a 6 player again.

With 4, you have much more control, more options each turn and less downtime, allowing you to work with the game mechanics rather than just making the best of the few options you have as is the case with 6.

---------------------------------------------------

Two 6 players games in, and a few lessons learned. The first play ran to 3.5 hours and went well as everyone knew what the game was about before signing up for it and had at least skimmed the rules beforehand. 

Second 6p game was a scratch game prior to which only two of us had heard of the game, the others were primarily players of shorter Euros. They liked the gameplay but it ran to 5 hours which they thought was too long (I'd struggle to disagree). To generate a good game experience here I'd match the players to the game carefully, which will limit how often it hits the table.

That said it's a deeply absorbing game with a lot going on. There are a lot of (cohesive and thematic) mechanisms in here, none of which in isolation is complex, but taken together they create a sophisticated whole. 

The board evolves (sorry) rapidly in play, and what seems like a strong position can quickly crumble. I think you need to make a choice when playing this; do you want to consider deeply every single action you take against what the others might do, or go with the flow a little? If everyone takes the former approach it's going to run long.

However, interest is maintained throughout as just about any action taken by the other players has the potential to affect you.

Slight concern over the effect of the chit draws on such a long game. As the arachnid in my last game I only saw one grub chit (the one that favours the arachnid) come out for Abundance while I lost count of the number of water chits (which favour the amphibian player) that came out. Granted he played well, but in the end the amphibian player won at a canter. Not an issue in a 45 minute game, but over 5 hours it was a little frustrating.

The domination cards are a bit chaotic but I think this is something the players need to plan for. First played with 5 and the game with rules explanation ran almost 6 hours.  I suspect future plays would run closer to 3 and a half or four.  As a three or four player game you could probably wrap it up in under 3 hours assuming everyone has the rules down.  All things considered the rules themselves weren't that bad.  As a whole I would recommend this game but its not for all groups.  I would say this is a war game at heart with some euro type mechanics.

Great game. Works wells. The theme is present in all cycles of play. The domination bonus cards are very strong...but may really reflect impact of major events on evolution.

Not sure about this one, I can certainly appreciate the mechanics and the way control of the different areas are worked out.  But the sheer amount of options and the way in which they affect the board makes the game very chaotic which makes planning out your turn very tough.  The different species don't make the game much different other than a small bonus which will give you a free action or stop something from effecting you.  It just feels to much like you are trying to organise chaos.

I would like to play this again.

A very well thought out design; I especially appreciate the theme and its integration with the mechanics. That being said, the game never really grabbed my interest. The strategy, present in abundance, was never really compelling and the game felt flat. The game is also long, especially if you are teaching new people. The components are adequate but by no means impressive. The price tag is hefty as well.

Has several pluses working in its favor. 1) Worker placement - nothing fancy, but executed well enough. 2) Random card draw - the various cards, of which you only see 5 per round, vary wildly in power. In addition, some cards are much better early in the game while others are better late in the game. Ideally, stay away from targets of the BAD cards, but it's much easier to say than do. The five cards available really set the tone for the upcoming worker placement round... and it's great! 3) Negotiation - the point track tells a small picture of the real score. It's up to the players to understand the true score and beat the appropriate leader. This game has become a staple in our group and will continue to see plenty of playtime.

Excellent hybrid of area control and worker placement, definitely would like to play again. Only reason it's not higher is because of the playtime, this can be managed by removing some of the dominance cards.

This is a great game! I love playing it, there is always such a range of emotions. You can go from feeling good, to about to cry, and then to plotting revenge within a matter of minutes. Every time I have played, the game play is so intense emotions run high. This is due to the Dominance cards in the game which essentially require you to play a bit rough, but always keep in mind your actions could come full circle the next round. Recommend, but not for the faint of heart.

Dominant Species is simply incredible. It offers layers of decisions and strategy throughout the game. Everything you do matters, and the decisions of other players affect you, so you are constantly thinking, planning, and evaluating. An original theme that comes through brilliantly. It is admittedly a lengthy game, but it doesn't feel too long b/c of the constantly engaging gameplay and interaction. A wonderful contribution to the hobby.

A kind of worker placement game that nearly feels like a war game. Does take a long time to play but by the end of your first game you'll be starting to sprint through the turns. Can be a little tricky keeping an eye on who is dominant on each hex, though.

No down time here, even if you are not acting you need to pay attention.

RATING: 9
1st edition.  A highly interactive area-control/worker-placement game on a familiar theme we all know and love.  DS is a game of balancing inequities with attention to furthering your own agenda while at the same time thwarting those of your opponents. I for one like the overall appearance and understated look of this game that doesn't get confusing when additional tiles and components are placed.  We adjust the 'length' of play by eliminating several given Dominance cards and clearing the unclaimed cards from the board after each round, or....  simply limiting the number of APs.  

Rating is based on 2-player games (and one 3-player), we love this game...  9 for now.

UPDATE:  I'm noticing a subtle but definite tendency in our 2-player games towards competing for the Tundra tiles to score the Survival card as points increase exponentially beyond control of just 4 Tundras.  Not sure this is a good thing... (reminiscent of base-Dominion with gold/Provinces)  :/

Fertile territory for AP--if there was a way to cut at least 1 hour off this game (maybe 2!), I think it would resonate better with me. The game is really well done and interesting, but you are confronted with a dizzying array of actions to select from, and then when it comes down to actually carrying them out, yet another surfeit of options.

RATING: 4
Based on one play with five players.

Worker placement and area control blended together with combat and game changing events. It feels as if there are too many things going on in this game. It felt that you struggled to create a good move only to find that the way you thought events were going to turn out was nowhere close to what you expected. 

If this game played in 90 minutes I think it would be fine but with the way it stands now I feel it gives an illusion of being something more than it is. Right now I'm not interested in sitting down at again.

A euro from GMT. On the heels of Leaping Lemmings we get the much heaver but also extremely good Dominent Species.

RATING: 8
DS is essentially a worker-placement driven majority game. The object is to collect the most victory points before the Ice Age comes. The heart of the game is the action menu, which takes up about 1/4 of the board. There is a large menu of possible actions on a turn. All actions are limited in number, so turn order is very important.

The game mechanics are not as complex has I feared, the action selection menu is very clear and no action is complicated in and of itself. But understanding the implications of an action is where it gets tricky. There's a split-level majority game - species (points) and elements (dominance cards) - and the element game is a complex one, with a constant shifting of needs and availability. You have a limited number of species for the game, so if you don't manage your stock well, you CAN run out before the game ends. You need to pay attention to the order of actions as well, since a previous action could negate the effect of a following action. It's all visible and above-the-board, so no random gotchas, but you do need to pay close attention or the actions of others WILL surprise you.

The game did not disappoint. There is so much going on in such a smooth mechanical structure that it is hard not to be impressed. 

UPDATE: Revisiting after a few years, I've downgraded this to an 8 due primarily to length. I think the game is really good and super engaging, but without dedicated or regular play, 4-5 hours is just too long. I have to knock this a point.

A solid multi-level area control game and probably my favorite of the genre. Mechanically driven by worker placement (WP), and wrapped in an interesting topic, Dominant Species utilizes the WP to encourage interaction rather than to avoid it. The use of multiple spots for most actions also means that players are less concerned about not being able to do an action but rather which actions to group together with limited pawns. This creates a nice trade-off between shooting for immediate results vs investing for future impact. Overall a good gamer's game.

Seems to be the most popular game on the planet at the moment. And for once a hot game I was interested in.

It is a very good game. It's probably a little too abstract for me to call it a great game.

It is a very long game and I think it will take serveral games to really get the hang of it. It's going to take a lot of commitment to get good at this one.

RATING: 6
A rating of 6 after one play.  The degree of micromanagement is too much for me.  The worker placement thing is very like Age Of Empires III and Carson City but those games are quicker, more strategic (Dominant Species is generally tactical with less genuine different paths to tread) with much less analysis paralysis and much better integration with the theme.  I don't know why it bugs me, but I would like to know what the players represent in a game, and in Dominant Species there is no answer: at one level the players represent the types of animal, but at another the players represent the forces of nature.  In either case, I just don't think that you can satisfactorily have players representing impersonal, non-intelligent forces - it just does not work thematically.  The worst is the glacier that can somehow decide which way to go!  Dominant Species is a very decent, somewhat overlong game which works just fine with some clever mechanics but the theme questions just nag away at me.

RATING: 5.5
Awesome but two significant problems:

1) Too many things can happen in a turn, you can be attacked by multiple players, on top of that add the powerful effects of the cards, make it really difficult to plan a turn quickly.

2) Too fiddly: really annoying to count the dominance. There should be some additional tracker for that, it's just so annoying. this is a dealbreaker for me.

I love how the game forces you to constantly make choices between short-term gain and long-term investment. Just one example: element placement.  Place an element as far away from the tundra as possible to maximize its safety, or closer to give you more hexes you can live in but the element will be more vulnerable to glaciation?

 Very well-balanced and well-designed.  I like the way the game kind of "teaches itself" to you by starting off small and adding more and more hexes as interactions get more and more complicated.

Not entirely comfortable with the degree of luck in a game this long.  But, the game design is really ingenious, with the double layers of area control, balanced asymmetric powers, etc.

Dominant Species may be the heaviest multiplayer title I've played. 

The game represents the masterful combination and refinement of some of gaming's most central concepts. It really is a thing to behold.  The game also creates an incredible sense of narrative along with an intensely challenging experience. My second play saw three species locked in a dire struggle to hold out against the coming Ice Age - my insects were nearly 80% extinct, and even the warmongering arachnids were spread thin (though triumphant). 

Let me describe DS "from the ground up." Players are building a modular board ("The Earth") made up of several habitat types: Sea, Wetland, Savanna, Jungle, Forest, Desert, and Mountain. Each type features a majority scoring scale as seen in the El Grande school of games. More points are available in richer, more habitable regions (Wetland for example), which can also support more biodiversity and so have more "places" in the scale, whereas a Desert offers fewer points and only two places. Players compete for majorities by piling species into a region (each cube is a species, and players represent a taxonomical class). Scoring, though, comes with a major twist. 

At each vertex on the map, an "element" chit is placed. These represent food sources and environmental conditions, essentially customizing the particular qualities of any given habitat. Each of the six animal classes begins the game adapted to two elements (for example, the mammals are meat eaters, the insects thrive in grassy areas, etc). As the game progresses, animal classes evolve and adapt to new elements, making them more suited to live in particular regions of the board. A species that is best adapted to a region is said to be "Dominant," and this is distinct from a simple numerical majority. Think of it this way: the insects in your house probably outnumber you, but they're not exactly the Dominant Species in your habitat. The game is representing that distinction with the two-fold competition for numbers and adaptability. 

There are five main scoring opportunities per round. A player who claims one of them will pick a region on the map to score (based on majorities), but the [i]Dominant Species[/i] in that region (the best adapted) then gets to select a special card from an available row. These cards are very powerful, so it's often not worth it to score a region you're not Dominant in, even if you have the majority there. This creates fascinating positional play on the board. 

That's the heart of the game. Modular board (six regions at the start, and up to three per turn added in what is usually a 5-6 turn game); two-fold majorities. Player actions are drafted a la Caylus, and these include the ability to evolve your species, to add new elements to the board (and sometimes remove them), to score, to add new regions to the board, to migrate species (move them around between habitats), and to eliminate your opponents' species. Turn order is important, and can also be adjusted in small steps. Since the game is about the onset of an Ice Age, once per turn the Glacier will further encroach upon the various habitats, scattering the species living there and potentially destroying some of that regions elements. Controlling the Glacier can be very powerful, and being the "Survivor Species" (the one with the greatest presence on the tundra) can also be a worthwhile way to score. 

There's a ton going on here; like I said, it may be the heaviest game I've played. Each individual piece is accessible and easy to conceptualize, but effective play is difficult. My one quibble with the game is that, at the far end of the action-drafting, it crosses over into a permutations game not unlike Chess, in which the volume of if-then considerations exceeds any other non-abstract board game I can think of. This does not undermine the rest of the game for me, but it's the one place in the design where I'm withholding my seal of approval. Permutations-gaming is a very specialized branch of the hobby, and one that doesn't mix well with any other variety of tactics and strategy. 

Bottom Line: one of the most inspired, ambitious, and developed designs in years. For many it will be too ambitious for its own good; for some it will be love at first sight.  

[b]Update:[/b] 3 plays in and I continue to find this enjoyable, but the ridiculous forward thinking is "a bridge too far" in my book. Admirable title but it will never be among the best for me.

Take turns placing action pawns. Cubes are placed based on on the environments that you specialize in relative to the tile you are on and those adjacent tiles. Just try to multiply your species relative to the other players to win. This is a fun game, but can be a bit too long at 3-4 hours.

This takes an animal development theme, adds worker placement and majority control, and creates a very coherent engaging experience.

Its strength is its weakness.  On the one hand you've got two things going on.  The worker placement phase controls what you can do, and offers strategic play and agonizing decisions.  Then when you execute the actions you picked, you've still got lots of good tactical meat - where do I move my cubes, which elements do I want to promote and where...

The weakness is that with both modules demanding thought, the game takes a long time to get through.

Excellent worker placement / area control hybrid.

Card effects balanced against board position and scoring make for a rewarding game. The game state is never static and care needs to be taken over the cards and how best to combat or nullify the effects against your position.

Highly interactive and strangely thematic in the integration of its mechanics.

Avoid AP prone players, although nowdays we can be done within 2 hours 4 players.

What. A. Game!  The "10" experience starts when you first pick up the box and feel it's substantial weight.  Then you peal off the plastic and open it up to find an incredible assortment of wooden bits, great quality cardboard markers and a wonderfully designed board.  Then you start to read the rules and are amazed by the subtle mechanics and substantial weight contained within.  
   Right from the beginning you can sense the struggle of these ancient animal species trying to survive primitive earth's encroaching ice age.  As you put yourself in the position of your species trying to survive, you intuitively sense when they need new food sources, or if they should migrate away from a risky location to take advantage elsewhere.  Do you ally with your strengthening/weakening neighbour or do you attack their strongholds?  
   A wonderfully complex yet simple game where player interaction occurs at nearly every step.  I would only suggest that you play this with your more serious gaming friends.  It suffers from a long play time, and if someone is not "Into" it, they will be sure to remind everyone else at the table.
   I. Love. This. Game.

It didn't catch my attention when it was on P500 but luckily early reports were very good. Otherwise I would have missed a great game. At its core, it is worker placement coupled with area majorities but as can be expected from GMT and Chad Jensen, it's not your run of the mill eurogame. Far more theme, far longer, far more conflict. This is what I like to play when I have 5 hours to emerge in an epic adventure. Forget about the ameritrash classics or Fantasy Flight coffin games.
From now on, I will watch Chad Jensen's new games closely. Combat Commander already was a pleasant surprise in a genre I usually don't enjoy too much and Dominant Species backs the trend.

I've only played this with three. Three was a wonderful number for this game. I love the way that your turns are very fast and the difference between point scoring and domination make for a very interesting balance between population building and adaptation/abundance. It is so coated with theme. I really have a hard time believing that GMT are the ones that put out this game. It is definitely made from the same production line as their other games, but it seems so unique in its theme and mechanics. 

All of the actions in the game are useful, and there are interesting ways that players are punished for ignoring parts of the game. The player interaction is high, and both games I've played ended up with a player seeking revenge on another player. Hilarious!

My favorite part of the game are the cards. They are hugely thematic, nuanced, and dictate a lot of the strategy for the specific turn.

Held out for a long while on this one, but having now played, I think I was mistaken to have done so. only played with 2p (no variant) so far, and expect that the game would be better with 3 or 4 or possibly more. There's a lot going on, and we botched some rules or remembered and then forgot them, but it all should be more manageable with a bit more experience. Typically tight Jensen rulebook--clear, concise, well illustrated, and just the right level of redundancy to clarify and remind without wordiness. The mats/player aids, though probably superfluous for the experienced, are good for newbies. Once the rules are (mostly) down, the focus can be on the gameplay, as it should be. Current (3rd+) edition is attractive and well laid out. If there's one complaint about the presentation, it's the cones, which are difficult to grasp owing to their shape and texture.

Epic game with a colossal theme? For someone with an interest in genealogy is this the ultimate tracing your family history game? Have to save up first.

Not as packed with theme as i was expecting, more of an abstract. Also has some overpowered cards and the reward for the tundra track later in the game are too large. What a shame.

The planning/worker placement phase is nearly as satisfying as Caylus but the execution phase is more dynamic and open, as it asks you to play an area control game amid changing landscapes and explosive events. I don't feel that any concessions were made for theme but the theme fits perfectly. Very slight asymmetry among animals for just a dash of flavor. 

Update: just played an overlong flop of a game with 6 players, 3 of which were new, and 2 of which were babies who always feel targeted and checked out early. Bring this one out discriminately.

One of my absolute fav games.  It is heavy, which I like, and long, which I also like.  Variable player powers, modular board, and worker placement on the side that affects the game board in dynamic ways.  Thematically very appealing, with the mechanics supporting the theme in convincing ways.  Handles up to 6 players, which is key, but plays well with 3,4,5 as well.  Not sure I would play this head to head, but it is possible to do so.  Total joy to play, as long as you enjoy heavier and lengthier games.

I have thoroughly enjoyed this game, which seems to bypass many of the problems that long and heavy games can often have.  Though it is longer than most of the games we play, the rules are relatively easy to explain and seem more or less intuitive.  There seems to be a lot of variability in the Domination cards that come out, and while there can be big swings, I don't feel that luck (in the Domination cards) plays too big of a role.

I like the theme of the game, though the artwork is fairly bland and uninspired.  Still, as you're playing it doesn't make that big of a difference.

RATING: 6.5
Essentially a worker placement game with two area-controls to manage on the map. Players are juggling their species and their "elements" and trying to expand both to score the most points. Very minimal strategy and planning because everything changes when it gets back to you, so the downtime is pretty bad.

The game itself is fairly straightforward, but definitely too long for what it is.

I absolutely subscribe the comment of marc magner BGG user, The game is broken and unfinished, there are elements beyond your control that can eliminate a player on the first turn from winning, which is unacceptable in a 4+ hour game...

A classic game of underdevelopment by the publisher, that needed playtesting under the direction of a quality game developer.

The chaos in cards and abbilities tokens draft is unacceptabble in a game that tend to be a worker placement strategic one, and that take too long. I mean, i like chaos games like cosmic encounter, but please that kind of games sucks during 4+ hour playing time.

I liked the theme because my wife is a biologist specializing in genetics.  I was looking forward to the game until my first (and likely only play).

In the game (a five player game), 3 of the cards that came up were ones that gave you extra actions.  These were hotly contested and pretty much went to player order.  I ended up with my original 4 cylinders while the rest of the players had 5 and one player (the only "experienced" player had 6 cylinders.  I estimated that there were probably 10 rounds or more in the game, so I'll have 40 actions compared to 60 actions for that one other player.

My thinking was that I lost, 10 minutes into a 5 hour game.  The experienced player kept telling me that the extra actions were not that good.  That the 50% more extra actions he got was not that much of an advantage.  This just made me more aggravated.  And he kept picking on my cubes on the board, removing them because I was easy pickings.  I asked to resign from the game, but the experienced player refused--saying that it would totally screw up the game.

So for about 75% of the game, I didn't even have a dominant area so I couldn't pick a card at all.  Any time I had a chance at an area, he came and squashed me with his extra actions.  I pretty much played kingmaker at the end against this "experience" player which I don't normally do, but I was pretty furious over the game.

I kept getting advice and comments which further make me dislike the game.  The winner of the game told me the main strategy was to spread out as much as possible on the last turn.  If that is true, why even bother with playing the 4.5 hours?

The core problem in my mind is are the extra action powerful or not?  If they are powerful, then the extra action cards early in the game will break the game.  If the actions are not powerful, then the game is too chaotic.

Note that my opinion is likely to be colored by playing at BGG.CON and felt like I wasted 5 hours of precious Con time.

I liked the game, but I will probably not play again, the strategic placement section is fun, but the cards are so horrifically unbalanced that it takes away any point of using strategy, and therefore ruins a lot of the fun. My only play was lost on the first turn of a 3 hour game as a player managed to get an extra action pawn in the first dominance phase and no one else caught up to him the rest of the game.

A heavy "take that" game, with the last rounds consisting of processing and reprocessing every move everyone can make and elements of possible king-making.

But there is plenty out there that I prefer more than this one. Too bad too - I was looking forward to this and now I know it won't work with my Home group.

RATING: 8
Complex. Absorbing. Takes hours longer to think through than it should. Late Fellini? No, Dominant Species.

The array of choices is stifling in this game - there are so many options that it can be quite tough to figure out, but Dominance is almost always the best action, and especially with four, it's going to be the one you want to hop into first place in turn order to take. Beyond that - well, good luck, son. 

DS suffers slightly from the same problem I found with Innovation: it can be a little tough to craft a solid strategy when by the time it's your turn again the situation you face on the board will often be completely different. This is mitigated by the action selection, which allows you to distribute your actions pretty carefully. On the other hand, the choices are so difficult and there's so much mental math re. sequence and who-will-do-what that you end up taking twenty minutes to figure out what to do with a single action sometimes.

I don't think that's necessarily a vice, though, just a sign of a game that's adaptable to a reasonable range of strategies. The cards can prompt wild point swings, but gameplay generally won't. All in all, I think this is a fine entry in the burgeoning series of GMT non-wargames, but it may be more good than fun.

Intriguing worker-placement - area control -hybrid. Suffers a bit from a long duration and should be played with a clock. Perhaps biggest selection of choices with a board and mechanics that really put stress on player's ability to perceive and analyze the situation. Biggest grief is that it is sometimes hard to see who is going to score most points on last turn so beating the leader enables somebody else to win tremendously (about 100 points can be gained on last turn alone).

Heavy area control game where you are balancing two types of area majorities, your number of species in a zone and how well adapted you are for survival in that zone. The worker placement aspect is amazing and makes the game have a logical progression each round as actions are resolved in order from top to bottom, all available actions are on the board so it's actually quite easy to teach. Best at 5 or 6 players, 3-4 hours.

RATING: 6
Okay game.  Very confusing rules relating to regression, wasteland, and depletion makes the gameplay slow, awkward and clumsy.  The player aid that explains the game play steps is written in small type which is difficult to read easily.  The answer is to pick up the aid to read it but this isn't easy because your animal's element tokens are supposed to be kept on this card.

Perhaps multiple plays and familiarity with the game will solve this problem but how often will I sit down to this game with experienced players only?  And besides, the game isn't that compelling or interesting to make me want to spend the time to become familiar with it.  I'd play this again if others truly wanted to but otherwise, I don't need to play this again.  There are plenty of other games of this type which are better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great theme matched with great mechanics - the mechanics make the "feeling" of each action mesh very well - I always feel like we really are species struggling for survival. Many different viable strategies, there is no one "best" strategy to adopt each game, and the different species abilities add a nice asymmetry to each species.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After a few more plays, my rating has gone down. It's not a bad game, there's just a lot going on and I'm not convinced it's entirely necessary. The main function of a lot of the choices seems to be to make the game go forever if you get stuck with a player who thinks through every option on their turn. I can get the same experience out of Age of Empires III, which has quite a few similarities to Dominant Species, in a much quicker time.

------------------------------------
It's a lot of fun to play, but my gut feeling is that the elements that turn up for the various options affect who wins more than player actions. That's only after a couple of plays though, and I may be wrong.

(Rating after many plays)

If I were a fan of worker placement euros I'd rate this game 11/10. Since I'm more into wargames I give Dominant Species 7.5/10. The game is engaging and entertaining, but it is also very dry. It seems thematic at first but during game you realize that you're just optimizing cube placement, not commanding animals. So far I played only 2 and 3 player games and I wouldn't play with more than 4 players. I guess the game would be too random with too long downtime.

One thing I dislike a bit (aside from being dry) are the dominance cards. These are very strong and for inexperienced players like myself can completely change the outcome of the game. I am certain though that experienced players can learn the cards and play as to mitigate their effects.

UPDATE: Rating goes up after some more plays. A really good game.

Second time played though in both games, we did not make it past three rounds.  It is a loooooonnng dry experience... and perhaps a bit too gamey for my tastes.

I want to really like this game.  Hoping to give it another shot with more time dedicated.  We shall see...

UPDATE:
One more time through and I think I may have to let this one go.  What I initially thought was an elegant game has become a fiddly mess.  Constantly needing to assess Dominance is no fun at all... especially when you have to factor it in for many tiles when elements are removed and such.  Leads to long down time. 

It never got to be as fun as I hoped it would be.

Dominant Species combines so many elements that I love into a game that almost defies description. It has variable player powers, a variable hex map that's created as you play the game, variable resource placement, a strong area control dynamic, dynamic event cards, and an incredible decision tree for worker placement. The big downside to DS is the three hour playing time, and that's if everyone already knows how to play. If if played more quickly, this could easily be a 9 or a 10, but the truth is that the long playing time keeps this game from hitting the table very often.

This remains one of my favourite games ever. It is complex, fulfilling, the theme is great, and the physical design is absolutely adorable. The density of the rules makes it a little more difficult to teach newcomers, but it is so worth it. It is definitely a lengthy one, and I find that taking out some of the dominance cards throws off the pacing too much even if it shortens the game. I wish more people had the patience to play it more often!

I enjoy this game, I freely admit though it doesn't come out for use that often though, it has a certain amount of complexity and it won't necessarily be a short game either which is another drawback.

there are a couple rules, that after years of other games, also feel a little rough though it's hard to put my finger precisely on it, but it's still enjoyable if you enjoy a mix of area control, and take that mechanics along with worker placement.

What’s not to like. Area control (al la El Grande), action selection (al la Age of Empires III) and variable player powers all blended together for a very good (if not great) game. Although I like it quite a bit, there are a few concerns: end of game scoring can be huge. Inexperienced players will focus on the player(s) ahead on the score track during most of the game, but they are not necessarily the ones to be concerned with. The cards can certainly have a big impact on the game, but the bigger factor (IMHO) is the random element draws which can be a big factor that is hard to plan or prepare for.  Sweet spot appears to be with 3-4 players.

RATING: 10
For me, this is very close to a perfect game.  I couldn't wait to play after reading the rules ... partly because I'm interested in the science of behavior and adaptation.  The way the game mechanics and the theme support each other is outstanding.  Our "game day" group of four played it twice yesterday and even though I got crushed the first game (every one else lapped me on the VP track), I am still loving the game.  Only after playing it twice am I starting to understand how much the game is about adaptation.  The randomness provided by the drawing of the elements, tiles, and cards are what give the game its strength and what reinforce its theme.  The earth is ever-changing and one must adapt or die.  We used the random set up for the 2nd game and two players had no species on the board to start the game, yet one of them found a path to victory.  Can't wait to play again.

Superb action drafting wargame with a single flaw: the random nature of element chit draws prevents the players from developing truly long term plans. But as far as heavy tactical games go, this is one of the best.

A very good game. Amazing gameplay. Very unusual theme and elegant game mechanics. A bit pity is that you don't have the feeling that you are really playing a species, it's more an area control game with kind of random theme... And well, the artwork is on the downside, too. But the game works so well, we enjoy it even with the minimalistic design and the thin theme.

Simple rules but complex strategy - on the hardcore side of things. Does a great job of really keeping theme and strategy intertwined and providing a variety of strategic options. Best kept to hard thinkers who want some conflict. Prone to AP. Keeping track of dominance a nuisance, Runs a little long for time.

Don't play 2- or 3-player variants for the learning game.

Long, slow euro.

Had some very interesting points but being on the wrong end of a couple of actions can completly knock you out of the game. If that happens at the start of a 3 hour game through no fault of you own it's pretty poor.

The game is good but i don't know how 'fun' it is.

The workerplacement area-control mechanism is smart, close and intense, very placement is crucial and important to build and grow the colonies of your race. Personally like the theme and and the concepts of each cards each actions with so many depth and meaty on it.

Oh man this sounds so interesting.
Probably will have a hard time getting it to the table however

Comment from geekbuddy John Bandettini

I think if you want to play Dominant Species in a shorter time you (well everyone really, not picking on you Charles ) need to have a mind set adjustment. Don't play it like a Euro, play it like a war game.

What I mean is don't fret about the small stuff. In a typical euro, you get a limited number of actions, waste a couple of them with bad plays and you will probably lose the game. With a war game your overall strategy is more important than any individual move.

If you think of it that way, you can get through turns a lot quicker, you are not looking for a perfect move every turn just trying to advance your strategy. With this mind set my group are playing the game in around two and a half hours and still enjoying the game a lot.

edit
finally played it. It took us over four hours which was too long.

I played the mammals which probably means you have to stage a comeback ( i didn't score the first two rounds)
I was succesful profiting from steve's insects and beating him on the tiebreak.

edit 2 :second game

amphibians but very little water appeared (abundance or wanderlust)  and the glaciation was over the water at the start.
Infact I think they are a pretty weak species if there is little to no water around. (I addedd water when I had the chance..

Mammals won again 168 points. BIrds second 153 points , amphibians 151 points. Spiders 125 points.

Worker placement, area control, a bit of war-game element, variable player powers, and a strong theme - all are nicely put together. A possible quibble might be the recurring calculation to decide who is dominant at a certain hex. With more players, it would take too long and must be much more chaotic.

There is a LOT going on in this game. You only have a few actions per turn, but many many things to use those actions on and it can create quite a bit of AP. At its core it seems like an area control game, but there are actually several viable way to accrue victory points, giving you many options if you are shut out of one or two scoring areas.

Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. 

Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes -- mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won’t last: It is indeed "survival of the fittest."

Strategic but very simple, very vicious, and has player elimination (sort of). The game will cause players to feel left out or ganged up against. I had board control and was holding back punches.

A beauty of a game. Long, crucial and tough. I guess it will be in my Top 5 for a long, long time. At first it seems pretty random and I get it why many people don't want to play it - it's a really long game and it doesn't look appealing. But they will miss one of the best games ever made. Every single faction plays differently and it's a blast to try a different strategy every time (birdie glaciation win is the best though).

A real brain burner.  Hard to imagine a more elaborate worker-placement game, and this one has a unique theme as well.  Many pure Euro players will balk at the domination cards which can suddenly and dramatically change the game state, but they feel thematically right to me and I enjoy them.

This would be a 10 if the art and component aesthetic were better.

Deep, lengthy thematic euro with many innovative game mechanics that is surprisingly intuitive and easy to teach due to excellent user-component design (all rules printed on components!). 

Intense, fast-paced experience with little down-time, although there is some AP-inducing design due to large number of potential action sequencing/programming choices.

I wrote a review of this game. It wasn't the best review, but the criticisms are still much the same.

I think there is a lot of empty time in this game. Board state changes between turns take away from your thematic investment and adds to AP, and the game length is long but the scoring is endgame heavy.

As a worker placement, efficiency scoring, game it is good - interactive, somewhat novel. But compared to other games I enjoy more I find some weaknesses.

Played once, 2 players.  This game is really an Ameritrash game in a Euro/GMT suit.  The bits are all wooden and cardboard, and there are tons of moving parts, but the effects of the cards completely dominate each round, and it is almost impossible to plan the course of a turn ahead of time.  With a new set of cards with toned down effects, I think this game might be an 8.  I also think that the game really requires more than 2 players.

This game is probably more complex than it needs to be while including cards with effects so devastating that they seriously reduce long term player agency.  There's a fair amount of bashing the leader and too much chaos for serious planning.  The core is very interesting and if feels like there is a spectacular game somewhere in there, but it's drowned in tedium, cruft and overlong play.  There's a lot of room for human error (forgetting phases, miscalculating domination, etc.) with easily game breaking consequences.  State of mind plays a large role I suppose.  You have to be in a mood for some chaos, having to constantly adapt and scrap your plans, roll with punches, take what you get and make the best of it.  I can see how this game gathered a lot of momentum and following, but it doesn't really do it for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I don't know what is the fuss about this game, but it seem people like awkward and inconvenient games. That are thing I generally want to solve in my game design rather than proposing them as features.

First, if you are color blind, avoid this game at all cost. Because you have 3 color level of analysis: first the terrain color, second the resources color, and third the players color.

All these levels of information made it impossible for me to analyze the board. It's just too complex, and if you are partially color blind, you cannot see relations in a glance like some other players could probably do. So you are constantly re-evaluating every hex without being able to find what is your best move.

Then considering that there are dozens of actions + special power cards, the choices are so overwhelming, that it was impossible for me to plan anything. 

So I simply played the bad guy, took control of glaciation and resources depletion all of the time.

Oh! and by the way, the game's artwork sucks badly. I mean, I am not an artist and I can do better. So please, it does not take a lot of effort to have something acceptable.

RATING: 6
If it not for the fiddliness and time-consuming tasks of keeping track of dominance for every tile and so forth, I would rate it a 7.  Also, since thematically Dominant Species has similarities to Ursuppe (Primordial Soup), but I would much rather play the latter.  Ursuppe seems more streamlined and more fun.  Dominant Species has some fun chaos elements but it is low in strategy and high in tactics.  Ursuppe has higher strategy and slightly lower tactics.  Plus, in Ursuppe, I can let my ameobas take a dump and tell my friends to go eat my $H!T... :)

RATING: 10
LIKES:

* I like that each animal brings a special ability to the game.
* While the majority vs domination concepts can be confusing the first play, this really brings a fascinating parallel competition/game to the game.  One is almost playing two different games at the same time although there is some relation between the two.  
* The 12 or so different actions really bring out the flavor of the game and can really swing rounds like crazy both in regard to domination and majorities.  
* When one scores a tile using the domination action, not only does the tile score points, but the person who has domination must choose and play a card that often can effect future scorings in the same round.  Finding combinations that work well here are just fun and interesting.  Another fascinating twist is that the majorities leader may not be the domination leader and either person could select to score the hex!  I love incentive based games.
* When your species cubes are removed from the tiles for any reason other than glaciation, they are actually removed from the game.  This can lead to a cube shortage for majorities!
 
DISLIKES:
* It is confusing to many people the concept that each cube is a species.  Just make sure to hammer the concept home that when one reads/hears species, it refers to ONE cube.
* While this isn't a negative per se, this game will take 4-5 hours the first time you play.  While it is straightforward to play, there is a lot to take in and think through while playing and choosing your actions.

This is a good, complex game, but takes WAY too long.  I guess, thematically, it should take long (I'm pretty sure natural selection is a time-consuming endeavor), but for me it just gets boring boring boring.  When you look around the table and more people are looking at their smartphones between turns than are engaged in the game, the game is not great, in my book.  I do like how much the power-dynamics of the game can change from player turn to player turn.

Holding judgement until at least 1 full game, but as it stands now, there seems to be quite a bit of things out of your control -- some take-that elements, and a little chaos and randomness -- so I'm not sure that I'm going to like this game.

A very good game however a bit long (about 3 hours) and some very randomness makes this to be somewhat pulled back in the ratings (although the randomness seems very random it it actually less then i initially thought). Great components though, i do not understand that comment from a lot of people here at the geek, first edition is worse than 2nd edition.
Also although it's components support 6 players i'm not sure if I like playing with that many. Seems more like a 3-4 player game to me.
The more I play it, the better i think it is. I do prefer to play without the extra pawn cards. it does make for a better game.

This game gets a 9 from me. I have nothing much to say but I had a lot of fun with it. It is just brilliant and very thematic how every species strives to survive on the board. It is very difficult to plan ahead and though having a good strategy is essential, tactics are also very relavent in ensuring your survival and continuous VP scoring. More plays might even net this game a 10 from me!

RATING: 8
VERY TENTATIVE initial impressions. Also, I love the theme, and so I am probably pretty biased. I love the combination of euro mechanics with a war game area control that gives it plenty of meaningful interaction. Obviously there is spatial strategy in area control of having majority where you're scoring while being parasitic to get residual points when your opponent scores regions you are in. However, there is also planning out how other people's actions will affect the board by the time you can resolve one of your own actions, giving a strategic feel similar to turn order manipulation.

Despite the many actions you can take this game's flow is still fairly smooth, as long as you don't have anyone too AP-prone. The basic concepts of the game are actually quite simple, it's just playing optimally that makes it a brain burner. Also, I like that despite the huge variety of spots the worker placement still feels fairly tight, as in you can meaningfully block someone off from a spot they want, or snipe an element token they were gunning for.

Despite my normal dislike of cubes to represent units the theme is really evoked in this game. Each animal class feels very different due to their ability to expand onto regions with different elements. I really like the customization of evolving your species, while it makes sense that you would have to spend energy (or actions) to have your gene pool retain adaptations, as for example growing webbed feet or something to be further adapted to the water should expend more energy from a biological standpoint. The actions that terraform the land gives an environmental theme to the game. While I'm not sure why the elements that were previously abundant suddenly disappear from the Earth (maybe they were too fertile and led to a crash in the ecosystem?), tundra only being able to encroach on adjacent territory adds theme both in the growing dread of the encroaching ice age and also that areas adjacent to previous tundra should be more likely to turn into tundra, especially if they are surrounded by tundra. It's thematic that it would harder to speciate in harsher biomes, and that biomes with more resources could support more diversity (more animal classes can score) and more life in general (more points). Wanderlust I am not so sure thematically because it would seem more beneficial to be in a corner away from other animal classes so that you can have no competition, but I think it is better mechanically. That you can't split up your movement points anyway you like may seem odd compared to most games, but again it makes sense that each species can only migrate so far in a given time. The scoring of having a lot of species in a region while having a leg up if you're best adapted to a region to me doesn't make perfect sense thematically (I feel like dominance should score more points than just the ice age but shouldn't be able to perform random catastrophes), but I do like how you become endangered if you're not adapted to a region at all, and that you get bonus points for roughing it out by living in the tundra.

The cons are it seems like you need the corresponding counterparts to each species to balance the game and I think it would be thematic if the different biomes started with elements relevant themselves (for example, the desert starting with sun), although that would probably really affect the game's balance.

EDIT: This game can cause AP pretty badly, and in that case drags the game out a bit too much. However, my sentiments that otherwise this is a tense (in that you constantly have to work to avoid your species from getting eliminated from specific regions), interactive, thematic Euro with a theme that is terribly underutilized remain. It can be rather tactical depending on how you play, but I like just how a predator you must opportunistically pounce on weak points in your opponents or zones you foresee your opponents being weak in, while still rewarding some long term planning in the genes and what can regress, etc.

EDIT 2: After my 4th game of this which took 5 hours the AP aspect is really starting to wear me out. This is a great 3 hour game, not so much when it is longer. I'm still keeping it at an 8 because I think it could shine with the right group, but my willingness to play with my current group is about a 5 right now. Since there are usually only 6 rounds in the game even over these 4-5 hours, even if you don't fall behind until the last round that is still 45ish minutes where you have to sit through. Also, the swinginess of a lot of actions in this game (dominance cards, preventing wasteland, etc.) really seems to rely on players to value things correctly or correctly identify who is a threat when, which can make the game quite frustrating (whether or not either player is valuing things correctly or not is besides the point, more that people can screw each other over without even realizing it).

One of my favorite heavier games, and an area control game like no other.  There are so many factors to consider, so many way to tweak things into your favor.  2 distinct phases of the game: all of the planning and jockeying for position, and then the resolution where you change your mind on the fly to do with what you prepared because the situation has inevitably changed.    Perhaps best of all, the mechanics/actions all perfectly match the theme, rare for such a game, IMO.  Specialization? adding more species to the board.  Regression? losing adaptations to the environment on the board. Etc, etc.

NOT a game for people with AP, and having to keep recounting strength on regions can be a bit mathsy.

Dominant Species is a fun game. Easy to learn and hours of fun. Personally I have only played 2 player which, from what I have gathered, is not the best way to play. Still the game is fun. You must set tokens down to determine the way the turn unfolds. Your species has to survive being eaten, frozen and essentially adapt to the constantly changing game board. With six species to pick from, each with their own special ability, you must struggle to survive against people and the environment.

RATING: 9
Really the game is about area majority, set collection that results in majorities in adjacent "elements" for bonuses, and of course the main mechanism is worker placement. There is quite a bit of information, almost overwhelmingly so at first. You soon realize that you only need to focus on what you need and what will affect you. That boils each round down to a hand full of actions and a much more manageable amount of information.

Tentative 7 after we called the game 2/3 of the way through our first play. We want to play again. We played with 3 and I think the game will be better with more, while 3 might be best played with experienced players or the latter and all players using 2 animals.

I've read quite a bit about the end game scoring and given the volume of points that you gain, not to mention the game seems to be about gearing up for the end, we obviously missed a huge part of the game. We learned quite a bit, so it wasn't for naught. Perhaps another play will prove this a great game, or as it stands just an ok game that I had high hopes for.

Update:

Another play with 5 eliminated all my doubts and frustrations with DS. The game is brutal, requires detailed and abstract planning, and is almost completely unforgiving. Skilled players actually do have a chance to catch up and the game provides avenues to do so. 

It's a shame that Mr. Jensen's games require several plays to simply understand the actual goals and the important aspects of the game. Some people might view that as part of the discovery but it certainly makes players feel lost and somewhat helpless in initial plays. 

It's quite a game, easily in the top three heaviest games I've ever played, and with subsequent plays threatens to push into my top ten of all time.

This game is like a cross between Caylus and Die Macher, and as much of a brain-burner as the two of them multiplied.  The different animals are clever and unique, and the action display design is ingenious. Teaching the game is also relatively simple for a game of this nature. However, with the full six players, tactics are confined and chaos is ramped. Four is probably a better sweet spot for this game. Overall, brilliant.

I like it really much and it got only rating 7 for its hard entrance. the game mechanics and other things are very hard to learn, it needs a workaround for implementing more symbols, so newbies has a more light entrance to the game.

This is a heavy worker-placement area-control game.  Some label it a war-game disguised as a euro because there is plenty of "take that".  Brilliantly designed; can be quite chaotic and dynamic, which a good player will manage.  

It has the feel of "El Grande" and "Tammany Hall", but even more nasty, and with a well-integrated worker-placement mechanism.  Deep as well as complex, highly interactive and engagingly tense.  Surprisingly well balanced given the asymmetric animal abilities.

[q]Chad Jensen suggests removing the following cards for a quicker game:  Intelligence, Parasitism, Omnivore and Immigrants. [/q]

Even taking out these cards, a recent 4-player game took two sessions and about 6 hours, including about 1 hr for teaching.  But two of our players were quite slow in taking their turns--if everyone would have played at my average speed, game length would probably been have cut down to 2-3 hours after teaching.  Plan well for board position at game-end scoring, where VP swings of 50-100VP are possible.

Not terribly difficult to grasp, and it is even intuitive once one gets the hang of this.  It can flow quite nicely when people keep their head in the game.

Perhaps the single most mentally demanding game I've played.  Definitely hangs out at the deep end of the pool.  But it's very impressive as a model of evolution and population growth, the player interaction is very strong and the number of choices and factors to consider is dizzying.  If the rating is low, it's because I can't see playing it all that often; it's just heavier than I'd like.  And I wish the design was a little more polished and fleshed out.  But it's an impressive game, no doubt.

This is one of the most conceptually interesting games I've ever played. Mechanically it's just a  super-involved worker placement game, but what's neat is that the actions the player has to chose from are designed so that they mimic the actual laws of natural selection that were in operation just before the last great ice age. If there's another game that's a more faithful attempt to model the world as described by high-level scientific generalizations, I've certainly never come across it. 

The extremely complex interaction of selective forces that take place as the game progresses makes it very difficult to tell at any particular stage of play who's got the edge, but the best response to this is to just watch the whole thing unfold and never mind about who wins.

There is real genius to this game.  I have only played a few times but thematically it is ingenious and I would always want to play this game.  It struck me while playing that the reason I like this game so much is it is perfect balance between Euro, war game and thematic game. It is one of best game ever designed.  

It is a heavy-weight game.  But it is worth the investment in learning it. 

I believe war, Euro and thematic gamers will like this game.  It's not a family game, but if you have children who like A&A they may like this as well.

9/2012 Living up to all expectations and more.  This is cut-throat all combat constant struggle wrapped in an entirely new package.  You have a limited number of species and have to portion them out wisely to not get killed of and get a chance to score some points along the way.  By the way, here's actually two lightly interconnected tames in one: area dominance and area species majority isn't the same and score independently.

all 4 player games. Very long and tedious game which tries hard to put too much into a single game, making the game virtually not functional. The most striking downside is that some of the cards are just plain overpower and unless you spend turns trying to advance to turn sequence, otherwise you'd just be helpless facing those disasters. This is especially bad after 4 hours-long gameplay.

After the latest play with 6 players including a couple of veterans I finally feel like I know what I'm doing in this game, and just hope I get to play again before these insights disappear!

first impression
+ : 2 original mechanices : 'elements' and 'glacation'
    good balance between the different animals
    chaotic cards are very strong and can provoke huge swings in points ! so a bad start can easily be compensated
In its core, it's a 2 dimensional area majority game on a roller coaster !
- : a little bit long ; would be better with 5 cards less
     near the end,  kingmaking can be an issue  if scores are tied
It's a pure tactical game. Take what you can take now. Don't wait ; in most cases the board changes radically the following round.

A long game that just became too repetitive for me. I also agree with many who call it chaotic.  While not wildly out control, things so rapidly change you are forever recalculating areas to determine dominance. It just ends up being too much fiddling around.
Seems like it's about 1/3 too long.
Plus, for me, there are better games out there that fill this nitch for me and play faster with less chaos and  that reward good planning and execution. Lastly, the cards can throw the balance way off- maybe not every game, but they serve to add more chaos in my opinion.
As for removing cards to shorten the game I would be concerned as to how it may unbalance the game even more and make it harder for certian players to be competitive.

Glad I tried it out, not sure I'd run back to the table to play again though.

La glaciacion esta cerca y la cadena alimenticia se prepara para adaptarse o morir. Seria un buen resumen para explicar a grosso modo en que consiste este juego.

Cada jugador toma el rol de una especie, que luchará por prevalecer sobre las demás en el mayor número de zonas del tablero. Para ello, deberá adaptarse a los diferentes tipos de terreno, a los ataques del entorno y de los demás jugadores.

Es un juego que comienza a disfrutarse cuanto más se juega (de primeras puede resultar criminal).

Played at WBC x2.  3-4 hours, 6 players both plays.  1st game was almost completely a learning experience (even after listened in Ryan Sturm's podcast), but got the hang (and Survival) in a nick of time to place 2nd.  The next game was intense, and I could have won if not for a miscalculation on which adaptation to relinquish during the last round... I ended up in second again.  The 4 hours went by in a blink for both games, even with some slow play in the start of the first and end of the second game.

The game can be brutal at times.  Everything you worked for can seem to go up in smoke all at once if someone gets a hold of Catastrophe or Mass Exodus, but that is what I love about this game.  You have to balance your area control with the adaptations that allow you to stay alive as well as fighting for turn order in order to score those domination cards.  Fantastic, fantastic game.  I am so glad I was forced to try it.

Great theme, great execution, but I’m loath to judge a game as rich and complex as this after just two runs. What can be said is that everything flows very nicely and intuitively, that drab appearance does not preclude a game from being thematically satisfying and that any chaos due to overly strong action cards is strongly damped down by the public knowledge of what’s available in a given round.

The strategic possibilities revolving around the adaptation of your flock to the current world map on the one hand and the changes of the world on the other hand are absolutely engrossing and might turn out to be my favorite part of the game. Incidentally, the potential for devastating moves on this front is bigger than for the action cards, especially if someone has put all of his eggs into one element type basket.

Griping about take-that cards would be appropriate if they were arbitrarily dropped into your enemy’s hands, but this ain’t the case here - if you see a card coming up that’s particularly harmful you, preventing it is usually possible, if pricey.

Hopefully, I’ll get to play this a couple more times during the coming weeks, since I’m optimistic that it could be great and not merely good.

This has probably replaced Power Grid for me as my go-to heavy Euro game. It seamlessly mixes area control with worker placement, and the asymmetrical player abilities tend to encourage each player to employ different strategies (without any ability seeming particularly overpowered). 

My main complaint with this is the leader runaway. It's not a huge deal, but when a game lasts 3-4 hours long and you realize you have no chance of winning halfway through, it can be really annoying and unpleasant to have to play out the next 2 hours.

It is not always good for a game to provide many choices. In this game, there is just too many choices, too many things going on - every action makes significant changes so planning ahead is almost impossible.

First I was attracted by the theme, but actually, this game was thematically poor. What does "Dominance" represent? And how does it enables species to use special power(dominant card)? How the competition occurs? A spider eats a snake? Then what does the food chain represent? Why is it irrelevant to competition and relevant to scoring?

In short, this games was unsatisfying both strategically and thematically.

LOVE THIS GAME!
Love evertyhing about it! The theme, the worker placement element, the constant interaction, the amount of choices you have, EVERYTHING!

Ok, it could be a little shorter, but there is a shorter variant where you play with fewer cards. 
Some cards may be a little imba, depending on the number of players and the time they appear, but you can just leave them out and shorten the game, all in one! 

Have I told you how much I love this game?

Granted, only 1 play, but I just don't get what everyone sees in this game. It is a solid game no doubt. But its dreadful to look at, a little dry overall, and we had no idea who was going to win the whole time (one of the people who was losing just spread out on the LAST TURN and won handsomely). Not sure why we played all the previous rounds if that was all you had to do.

I do like this sort of action selection though.

I would play it again for sure but I would never ask to.

Area-Control at its finest. A clever use of cards and good timing of your actions determine your success or failure in this strategy gem. The newer editions looks nicer. A true classic i will never sell. Every gamer should know this title. Only scoring for Dominance can get a bit cumbersome - especially with full player count. Fortunately there is a App implementation for playing against AIs. If you want more and deeper, challenging and crazy wild gameplay with a similiar topic play Bios:Megafauna after this here. You wont regret that.

This game is extremely cool. I love the concept. But we ran into a few problems that made this not a keeper for us. It's too long. We added a process to cycle through the cards faster, and it still lasted three plus hours. It's also much too chaotic for the level of thinking required. I don't mind a short, light, chaotic game. I don't mind a long, thinky, strategic game. But long and chaotic where my carefully thought-out moves could be easily destroyed because the board changes drastically every move, that doesn't work for me. The biggest problem, though, was there's too much direct conflict in it for us.

RATING: N/A
Good tactical strategy game. Worker placement in which every placement matters, and you must be ready to give up desirable moves to get even more desirable moves. Components don't reinforce the theme much, but mechanics do. Enough balanced asymmetry to feel like you are unique among the players. Moderate learning curve, but player aids help, especially with gamers. Better for tactical players.

RATING: 9.5
Brilliant game which mingles a worker placement setup with a battle mode... it is just excellent. Quite complex decision-making (placing about 8 (!) action pawns in the planning phase of a single turn) which remains remarkably intuitive. The dominance mechnanism is great (although the obtained domination cards add some / too much (?) randomness). The theme is exciting and very well abstracted in this game.

After 3 plays I really enjoy this.  It is only long for people who can't play 3 hour games.  The game feels short (like Through the Ages) even when it does take 3 hours or so.  AP and this game could really be a painful experience.  My initial rating after a couple more plays will probably be an 8.  The 'simple' art fits the theme and looks fine to me.  I buy games for the game, not the art.

After several more plays it earns an 8.  This is a solid game, lots of tough choices and good replayability.

If you are going to introduce this to someone new, just remember its a war game, not a Euro.  One of my friends likes to really mull over all the consequences of every move, outcome: 5 hours later I realised I'm going to have trouble getting this one to the table again.  I absolutely love this game though.

I've had an opportunity to play this a few times to the end, which given the lengthy play time is not an easy task.  The game is not as complex as it may appear at first glance, and there is definitely a lot of strategy involved.  The main drawback is the constant counting and calculating that is involved with keeping track of 'domination'...I feel the game could have been streamlined a bit more and an alternative (quicker/simpler) mechanic for domination should have been studied.  Semantics also tended to throw us off as the word dominance and domination were used frequently in the rules to explain totally separate mechanics.  Overall I felt it slightly overrated and don't know how often it will get played.

RATING: 7
Not played enough to give it higher rating.

The couple of plays done enjoyed but its so long dont get it to the table often enough.  
Would have played more if not for the suggested rules for 2-3 players suggesting you play 2 animal types and only score the lowest. Not keen on the idea of that mechanic personally although to be fair not been able to try it to know for sure.

RATING: 7
Just not my cup of tea. The game works mechanically but the player induced chaos and the lack of dominance checking enforced by the game just turns me off completely. Every species feels exactly the same. One little rule change does not make a huge difference in playstyle.

Scratched an itch I didn't know I had.  Felt a bit like El Grande and Vanuatu.  Cube pushing, action selection, with cards to create chaos and devastation.

I'm not normally a fan of long games (we played with 6 and it clocked in at about 4 hours...yeah we've got some AP issues with some players) but I had a good time. Time flew by. 

Any game that has me thinking about it the following day is doing something delicious.

I think it´s too chaotic with 5 and too chaotic with the card effects. Actually, it´s too chaotic, period. The game invites you to plan ahead or at least make tactical choices, and then it all falls apart. When you choose Dominiation, you have no idea what the board will look like by the time you get there. I guess you could play the game with a lighter approach, but that doesn´t work for us. The game is very clever but it´s too much work for too little.

Dominant Species requires players to bring their subgroup of animals, whether they be mammals, insects, reptiles, etc., into pre-eminence on the board/earth.

This involves making lots of choices as to what types of food your group can eat, what kinds of environments they can live in, how many cubes to place and where to place them, and many others.  By the way, cubes represent various species within your animal group, but not animals themselves, confusing right?  While trying to think all this through players also have to be wary of other animal groups moving in on their territory, ice formations making certain areas practically uninhabitable, and various other disasters.

Dominant Species is a very very thinky game.  This makes it also a long game.  I like the idea of it.  I appreciate the mechanics of the game.  It was interesting to play, and I'm glad I did...once.  I say once, because I never felt like I was having fun while playing.  I felt like I was doing work.  So, as much as I appreciate the thought that went into creating Dominant Species, it's just not for me.  I play games to have fun, and hopefully in a shortish amount of time.  This one isn't short, or fun for me.

I like this game - all anxiety and anguish, just as it should be.  This gamer's game feels like a bit like Age of Empires but meatier and more utilitarian.

RATING: 9.3718
Excellent, engrossing, extremely entertaining.  Lots going on.  The rules are simple, but the game is not. Seems more tactical than strategic.  The rule book is excellent, fine tuned and with laser precision in describing the game.  Lots of nice touches in design (starting tiles, chits and player markers, for example) shows an attention to detail to which more games should strive.  

On the down side, analysis paralysis is a definite possibility, particularly with new players.  There are opportunities for a player to score huge points that may not be immediately evident to new players, which can give the experienced player a distinct advantage.  But even then, the game is just so damn good and fun.

After a few more plays, bumped up the rating a smidge.  I hate this game -- some of the choices you're forced to make are agonizing.  But that's a good thing.

I left more details on some review threads but can sum it up here:
Beautiful artwork, board, and components
	Note: highly split on editions – many love 1st ed, others hate it (and vv for new edition). I love the original. 

Best manual to date – concise, great use of pictures and examples, pretty. 

The theme is well done and it’s a good thinking game. 

The bad:
Holy crap is it long. And it feels long. Some variant talk about removing the cards (or using them as points only) to speed things up. I’m still toying with the idea of removing Wasteland and Depletion as well – it’s that long. 

Bash the leader. Just don’t like that in games. Variant suggestion would be to use hidden pt chips instead of public track. 

Was so hoping for this to be great, and it could be with a few tweaks.

[b]2016-04-02 8[/b] After 5 Plays:
Very strategic games but takes a very long time to play. Really enjoy how strategic it is as players have the power to improve their own adaptability and control the environment. The dominance calculation is a bit fiddly and changes a few times during a round. The game play is very cutthroat but it is all open information and there is no backstabbing. Definitely a game that requires many more times to make less mistakes. Adjusting score to normalize against new scale and also to lower for the long play time.

Since everything is open info, players have a tendency to evaluate for others what the best moves might be in both scoring and use of dominance cards. Happened in almost all of the games so far, much more frequently than any other games I played with the same players.

RATING: 7.5
Its a vicious, cruel, long, brain-burning masterpiece. Expect your species to die horribly due to circumstances or your opponents actions. Your 'state' will swing, and you will need to tactically respond to that, but there are still some underlying strategies to be employed. Its not perfect, its a bit dry and abstract and LONG, but you will be engaged the entire time.

This game is simply amazing. Perfect blend of chaos, confrontation, area control, worker placement, and strategy, in a beautifully stunning game. It is long, but absorbing. Every move changes the environment and the other species. You must plan but be willing to change plans at a moment's notice. I think I really like that this super deep game does not require counting every point and can be played very intuitively instead. One of my favorite games for design, theme, conflict, and mechanics. It is just too long to get out often and most casual gamers would be overwhelmed. Do not play with AP prone players.

nice game of establishing control on a playing board of hexes.  Fight for scoring control (most cubes on a hex), and dominance (most matching ecosystems and adaptations) on the board.  Manipulate many aspects of the game via the various phases of the game turn.  Each player has only a limited number of actions they can take each turn, and figuring out which is the best is not easy.

I like it, but could see a problem of downtime if playing with some real AP prone players.  

Note that the complaints of graphic design are off in my opinion - the different shapes make evaluating the board very easy.  I find it looks very nice, and I dont think plastic spiders would make it any better.

I'm starting to develop a list of games that would probably be great if you played a lot with the same group of people, and Dominant Species is one of those games. There is enough tedium in keeping track of who is dominant, the game has a couple of insanely swingy elements, and it in general has a ton of things to try to keep track of. 

So far, I don't really like the game through two plays but I feel like I *should* like it.

07/26/14 Played 6/7's of a four-player game (fourth printing, I think) in 4.75 hours. 
Dominant Species was even longer than I'd anticipated. The phases of the turns were logical, but there were just too darn many of them. That's what caused all the analysis paralysis and turned what could have been a 2 hour game into a 5 hour affair. I've played several "evolutionary" themed games (Evo, Wildlife, Urland, Primordial Soup, to name a few). None of them took half this long, yet they retained a great amount of theme and strategy. Dominant Species might be a good game if about half the 15 steps in a turn were eliminated/combined. These "extra" steps are what turned Dominant Species from a possibly fun game into a math exercise punctuated by heavy doses of chaos (almost anything one did could be undone by someone later in the turn sequence). If I ever play it again I hope its not for at least a year. And there's no way in hell I'd play with more than four.

(-) Can feel quite "chaotic", as your position on the board can quickly change dramatically. Moreover, tile draws can sometimes add to the randomness of the game.

(-) Sometimes the final scoring tends to "wipe out" all efforts made in the first couple of rounds of the game

A very, very good game that's actually pretty straightforward in play, but trussed by the myriad possibilities each turn offers. Hard work from that point of view. A combination of take-that screwage and really deep brainburner, the only thing I don't like is the play length because you have to keep your concentration up for long periods. By the end, I really want some light relief.

In other news: this has to be one of the worst game covers I've ever seen. It's truly awful. GMT are generally pretty bad (though I do like C&C:Napoleonics and CC:Europe) as far as box artwork goes, but this thing is f***ing hideous.

I'd advise against the challenge of micromanaging 3 species apiece in the the optional two-player variant.  It becomes more of a chore than fun.  I have the most fun with 1 species apiece regardless of the number of players.

Game length is its biggest fault. I understand the changes, timing and scoring techniques throughout different stages of the game, especially with the spreading of the Tundra hex's, but I feel something could have been done to make this game flow more quickly.

Deep and rich euro game that combines worker placement mechanics with direct player interaction. Slightly fiddly rules with plenty of things to consider and different hierarchies and point scales to use correctly  when playing makes for a slightly daunting initial threshold including home-brewed and somewhat counter-intuitive terminology regarding keywords like "dominance", "elements" etc. Relatively low player downtime but extensive play times - hours in the plural, expect three. Anticlimactic ending with sudden point tallying. Highly thematically consistent, highly inelegant, not particularily fun, but recommended for people who enjoy solid mechanics that demands keeping several orthogonal aspects in mind at once over fun or pleasure.

 A superb game with a great theme that's well integrated. The game is both highly tactical and strategic.

Despite its complexity, it is surprisingly easy to play, but hard to master.  Cards inject a little randomness that adds to the "fun" factor although even that is mitigated by being able to see them lined up with lots of time to prepare for their effects.

This is a gem of a game.

Dominant Species indeed. This game is a chaotic ride where you try to survive the churn. Once-rich areas are laid waste by glaciers or stripped bare of the things you need to survive, leaving only the fittest. You try to build your own uninvadvable niches on the board, or you adapt to survive everywhere and leech of the more dominant species.

This is a game of area majorities but with added texture. Both the players themselves and the board collects (or loses) element chits - matching your elements to those on the board means that you are more dominant there, have no matching elements and you better get adapt, or run away lest you go extinct. For most of your points all you need are the majorities, but domination lets you access powerful cards that can severely upset a player's position. This enables players to leech of each other, driving players to chose between points or cards. 

The brutality of the cards and the way players can shape the board means that this is not a game of indirect interaction and optimisation. You focus heavily on beating down your opponents, while trying to incidentally align it with build a superior position for yourself. Reading and assessing a player’s overall position is difficult, as much of the game is not simply tactical manoeuvring to maximise your points for each turn, but instead setting yourself up for the important final scoring in a very chaotic environment. Baking in contingencies and defensive plays into your strategy is required to not be at the mercy of the random element draws or the cards that come up each round. 

The game takes a while, but it has an arc to it that very much fits the theme, and each game can take a different shape, from a blossoming paradise where species thrive, to a barren wasteland where everyone is happy to not go completely extinct. I really like this game as a very interactive game that doesn’t boil down to overt negotiation. The elements and the minor unique player powers each species has results in different incentives for each player, and you can manipulate these to create conflict “elsewhere”. So while I’m not sure you can guarantee yourself victory through good play you can very much ensure your demise by playing badly - and that works for me!

RATING: 6.5
I can see the allure of this game, and I do see that it is fantastic in many ways.  Unfortunately, this game isn't my cup of tea.

The issue is a combination of length, largely tactical (as opposed to strategic) gameplay, and a high screw-age factor.

Area Control games are generally mean, which is fine; the problem here is that this game is very complex and long, so the antagonism is exacerbated.  It's a real struggle, which while thematic, tends to wear me down over the length of play.

Granted, I haven't played the game extensively, but it does feel that one needs to play for short term goals.  However, so much can change so quickly that you're constantly reassessing the game-state and that leads to longer turns, AP, and a lack of overall strategy.

The theme is definitely there for a Euro, but in the end, it feels abstract.  The theme was a huge draw for me, but the only things that remained feeling thematic are the player powers.

I'd definitely play it in the future, but it would have to be under the right circumstances.  So I'm giving it a 6+.

Only bad if you aren't a fan of strategy games.  This game is masterful.  Better than any strategy game I've ever played.

Update: While technically very proficient and still the highest strategy I am aware of, it lacks somewhat in the fun factor for many people.  Still the best game to play if you want to match wits with someone; in my opinion.

Played this a few times back when it first came out and am glad to now own a copy.  I've actually won a session or two by now, but mostly end up getting too far ahead in the midgame to avoid being ganged up on, so I still need to develop the skill of staying under everyone's radar.  Nevertheless, this is a game I will always play when offered the opportunity.

This is a great game.  Looks fantastic, plays agonizingly.  Rulebook extremely well done.  I want to play more, which is the best compliment of all.

My 17:  Still is a great game.  Plays well at various player counts.  You have to be ready to smack and be smacked.  While the end point tally is very important, and you have to time for it, don't neglect to score early on as well.  Even minor dominance cards are useful. so don't neglect them.  Those action cylinders are very important as well: don't miss out on them too easily.

Evolution isn't an easy concept to port to a boardgame format, but I can appreciate this one despite it's flaws. There is a lot going on in this game, players will feel overwhelmed, but then again that's evolution for you. The mechanics feel very similar to that of Age of Empires III, but the inconsistent iconography and the lack of intuitive rules bog the game down needlessly. I feel like GMT could/should have spent some more time playtesting this one and invested a little more in the components to make the game much easier for the players to quickly assess their position by looking at the board which would speed up gameplay considerably.

This game plays like a 10. It actually probably comes in at a 8 for me due to the lack of production value and the weight of the Dominance cards on strategy. But that should not be a roadblock to enjoying a game that is quite possibly the best release of 2010. I admit I wasn't thrilled with the theme, but the mechanics and game play overpowered my prejudice. The rule book is excellent! Euro-game aficionados will dislike the power and the slight randomness of the Dominance Cards.

UPDATE July 10, 2012: The 3rd printing edition fixes a lot of the production value/art aesthetic issues I had with the 1st edition (1st & 2nd printing). Upping my ranking to 8.5.

Expansive medium-heavy game bringing together several Euro mechanics.  Worker placement to trigger scarce effects, area control (with obligatory colored wooden cubes!), variable boards and slightly variable player powers.  These mechanics come together fairly well on the first play, but probably not as much for someone not familiar with the game styles.  Get people used to this with Age of Empires + El Grande.

Excellent eurogame.  

Complex (for a euro), long playing time (3+ hrs for your first game), somewhat fiddly, but also a good mix of short term optimization and long term planning.  A fair number of options to consider each turn.

Good tie-in between thematic elements and game mechanics, and room for aggressive plays.  Elements of a complex version of area control and action selection games with many varied ways to score vps that rewards both tactical and strategic planning (leaning more towards sharp tactical plays).

Production quality is very good imo (decent cards, wooden bits and mounted board)... nothing flashy about the game graphics, but they are very effective in communicating the state of the gameboard (i.e. it is easy to read the board quickly).  I much prefer utilitarian graphics (which still look ok) over flashy, but harder to read graphics (especially in a game like DS where alot of stuff is happening on the gameboard).  Thought the rules book was well organized and easy to read.

Recommended for eurogamers who enjoy longer, deeper and more intricate games.

Another excellent worker placement game but damn what a mean game. Not for the light-hearted. Some of the powers seem uneven but I'll need more plays to determine this. The components of this game are lacking. They have no connection to the theme but the card thickness is very good. Play time is always long but the game is very engaging even with the downtime.

LOOKS: Looks boring from online pics.  But don't loose faith.  Looks very good in person.  And the board gets busy quick!  You'll be thankful the art is so simple.  What is bad is the eyesore of the GMT logo pasted in too many places.

Disclaimer: I love nature documentaries.  More so than sci-fi, fantacy, or resource farming.

Opinion:  This is a long game.  Make quick turns more than worrying about exactly the right thing to do.  After you play a few times, then start thinking more.  Hugely interesting game.  My game of choice if I feel like something heavy with a huge time commitment.  This game is mechanically a work of art!  And the theme fits very will with the mechanics.  I wish it could facilitate faster play, but that's my only game play complaint.

Instant love. Is it long? Yes. Does it cause AP? Yes. Is it still fun? Oh yes. Most games that mix too many focuses leave me wishing they hadn't. *Two* area majority mechanisms plus worker placement plus "attacking" plus exploration plus special powers plus powerful event cards plus map destruction plus more. It sounds like an over-engineered train wreck and yet it is instead a symphony. Every one of these disparate pieces is interrelated. I need more plays but it is hard to get it to the table because of the time and attention commitment required.

Un très bon jeu de majorité, très interactif. Le thème est bien rendu, même si le matériel est un peu abstrait (au moins il est ergonomique).

DS is a game of tactics, where you weave your way through a maze of possibilities amidst the chaos formed by other people trying to do the same thing. The world shifting underneath you is the big factor -- your animal class changes only slightly (Adapts) over the course of the game.

The action pawns placement reminds me of the mechanics of agricola but in a smoother way. At first, i thought the game would be rule-heavy and unsuited to play at 2 players but i was wrong. The rules themselves are easy, what is harder is how to figure out a winning strategy. The game also plays very well at 2, either by the standard rules or by playing several animals.

It's a jewel in my collection !

The theme and mechanics mesh really well in this game.  There are tons of options and tactical decisions to be made each game round.

I have a few minor quibbles (such as not being able to easily tell the red and green blocks apart) and the choice of having reptiles higher on the food chain than birds, but other than that it's a very good game. It's more abstract than American Megafauna--although that's more a result of the scales of the two games. Very nice components, the rules are well written, with interesting mechanics and theme. Some of the cards seem over powered, but I don't mind the chaos they generate (after all, it is "modeling" natural systems).

Played once with three people.

This is a complex, meaty area influence game combined with a worker placement mechanic to determine what actions you can any given round.

I can't imagine this game with more than four people, even though it supposedly holds up to six.  Even with three people trying to predict what would happen in a round was very difficult, as there are a ton of actions to do.

But this is a great meaty game for when you have 3-4 people and a lot of time on your hands.

Heavy worker placement. Possibly too much luck with cards that can swing the course of the game widely. Probably too lengthy for a game that feels so tactical rather than strategic, since the game board can change drastically from turn to turn. There are some simple variants to shorten the length of the game that I would probably use if I played in person - currently all my plays are on iPad… I would definitely avoid with players prone to analysis paralysis.

Kingdom Builder (another area majority game I just started playing) feels way more strategic and is a great example of the benefit of elegance in game design. There aren't as many bells and whistles, but there is still plenty to contemplate and the strategy feels more meaningful. It's also MUCH easier to teach and has plenty of variety with variable board setup, "kingdom builder" cards, and all the different "location" spaces with variable abilities.

Also, while the idea of Dominant Species theme-wise is cool, you actually control not just a species but the environment, too, which feels weird. Am I supposed to be a dominant species or am I supposed to be the earth? Am I God? If so, why do I only care about one specific species… eh, the theme kind of falls apart there.

Worker placement game based on animal groups competing for resources on a hex-based map of the world. The game is long (a 6-player game took 3.5 hours with 5 Dominance Cards removed to shorten the game). I can only comment on the first play and I'm sure there is much to explore here in terms of strategy but, the game does seem rather chaotic. The ability to plan long-term seems limited. With so much movement and placement by other players you are pushed into short-term tactical play which whilst fun (lots of banter of the 'I've got three nuts' variety!) leaves you a little exhausted. The other minor annoyance is the constant need to assess the dominance in hexes, which whilst relatively simple, slows the game down.

I am cautiously optimistic after a single 2-player game with my wife...

Wonderful way to spend 4 hours. The ruleset isn't too complex, and each decision has a ripple effect. Just a brilliant game.

We routinely remove 5 action cards and finish 5 player games in almost exactly 2 hours. Run and tell that.

I love Dominant Species, but the dummies I game with prefer Eclipse.

RATING: 8
I could care less about the worker placement mechanics - what makes this game amazing is the perfect marraige of theme and mechanics which create a massive butterfly effect inherent in each choice. It almost (but not quite) makes planning impossible, as one tries to parse the exponentially expanding web of if-then scenarios a beautiful kind of brain burn sets in. So, players have to play tactically rather than strategically, quite literally evolving their approach over the course of the game. This plus the actual direct conflict makes this game a work of art.
----------------------
Ratings downgrade to 8. After several plays of this I am starting to see a couple of things that dulls the sheen quite a bit - sometimes a player can have such terrible luck with token draws that they spend their entire game trying to prevent Wasteland and Desolation, while their opponents stomp them across the map. Adding to this is the card draws - if a player isn't high enough on the turn order track, and doesn't have the time or opportunity to increase his position, there is a significant penalty of being repeated victim of the negative cards without any real strategic recourse to mitigate these negative effects. Furthermore, the game seems to be increasingly group dependent - if a player is left alone, for whatever reason, he will tend to do far better than he might otherwise be expected to do. All of these negatives make the game somewhat less fun when any one (or god forbid all) of these issues occur.

RATING: 9
Some context first.....I'm a eurogame/card game/abstract game player. I almost exclusively play games that take less than 90 minutes and have modest rule sets. The absolute limit of my complexity tolerance is Le Havre which I thoroughly enjoy. When I first read about Dominant Species I was worried about both the length and complexity.

However my professional field is environmental studies. I have yet to play an ecology/evolution game that incorporates population dynamics, changing habitats and climate, adaptation, and migration. Only the now out of print Extinction (invented by the great biodiversity theorist Steven Hubbell) came close, but it mainly emphasized population dynamics. So I was intrigued by Dominant Species and decided to get a hold of a copy.

One more caveat: I mainly have the opportunity to participate in two player games. It was crucial for me that Dominant Species would work with two.

In my view, this is an utterly brilliant game. There are multiple plans to victory, it inspires improvisational excellence, it is no harder to learn than Le Havre, it is fluid and dynamic, it has endless replayability, and it incorporates randomness and unpredictability as well as any strategy game I have ever played. 

In learning the game using the impeccable rules, we had a few false starts, mainly because we forgot to do something. There is alot to remember. But the play aids cover everything. It does take some effort to learn the game, but the rules and player aids do as good a job as I've seen in helping you along.

As a two player game this is absolutely magnificent. You have a great deal of strategic choice, and each time you play you learn something new about the remarkable chain of possibilities. We recently played Arachnids against Amphibians twice on consecutive evenings. The games uniquely unfolded. We could easily play these two animals multiple times before having the urge to try the other creatures. Our two player games take two and a half hours. I can't imagine playing with two or three animals each as that would insure brain melt. However, the replayability with the various creatures is still extraordinary. I'm looking forward to playing Dominant Species with more players.

I'd like to compliment the lovely, understated artwork as well. This is a beautiful game to play and look at. The pastel colors, the font on the cards, the feel of the board and pieces all reflect high quality. This is the closest a cardboard game can some to being heirloom.

Finally, Dominant Species brilliantly crosses the boundary between abstract and theme. My view is that an ecology/evolution game must have abstract qualities as the dynamics of adaptation are representational at this scale. It's all about the patterns that connect. Yet the creative richness of ecology and evolution demand thematic metaphor. Dominant Species matches great gameplay with wonderful aesthetics. 

One of the primary difficulties in constructing a game about ecology and evolution i finding the appropriate spatial and temporal scale. It has to be conceivable and tangbile enough so that you can manipulate the variables so as to play with them without being overwhelmed by the otherwise daunting complexity of the ecosystem. Indeed, that is why it is so hard for us to perceive global environmental change. I write about this subject at great length in my book Bringing the Biosphere Home (MIT Press, 2001).

I'll leave my environmental studies pedigree for now.

As a gamer, I recommend Dominant Species as a brilliantly conceived, wonderfully variable, and deeply rich game. It is totally absorbing, highly compelling, and just plain great fun. It is pleasantly hard. I just love the magnificent flow of the game play. Thanks to all involved for inventing and producing such a landmark game.

I can never figure out what is happening in this game.  I like a lot of the gameplay mechanics, but a game board really ought to give you information on who is winning.  To understand that in DS, you have to refer to every player's food cards - way too much work and a severe headache.  This game could have been a lot better with a different map interface...it would probably rock on computer.

Heavy weight worker placement.
Very solid game, good mechanic for the theme and I love the fact that there is a final scoring to look out for. But at the same time you have to be aware that about 1/3 of the total points are due to that final scoring.

I respect the design of Dominant Species tremendously and have gotten a lot of enjoyment from this game. I disagree with detractors who dismiss the game outright due to its chaos, but I have to admit there is an upward bound to how much you can mitigate it. After thirty plays, I feel like I've seen all there is to see here, barring the development of online play, which would allow for testing and propagating new strategies I haven't come across around here. (The iOS implementation works, but the AI is terrible, even with its recent improvements.)

For those looking for a shorter 2-player variant, we settled on a couple quick changes that worked well for us. Each player plays one Animal and gets 30 (not 55) cubes. In addition, use only the following fifteen cards: Aquatic, Biodiversity, Biomass, Cold Snap, Ecodiversity, Fecundity, Fertile, Hibernation, Ice Age, Instinct, Mass Exodus, Niche Biomes, Nocturnal, Omnivore, Predator. If you want to ensure the game lasts just three rounds (as we did), discard any cards that aren't activated at the end of the round. However, even with these changes, I disagree heartily with the sentiment that the 2-player game is "pure skill." You remove the multiplayer chaos, and the above card selection yields a little bit more predictability about what cards you'll see and when, but the Elements become a much bigger factor. If those come out in a certain way, you will have a hard time winning (or losing), no matter how skillful your play.

Although my interest in playing this is currently pretty low, I cannot deny the dozens of hours of enjoyment this game brought me, so I'm keeping this fairly lofty rating.

RATING: 6
After 1 play.  I need to give this another try but honestly, it's just not my kind of game.  It's very heavy and too long.  Every decision relies on 10 other decisions which all depend on what someone else may or may not do.  I just don't enjoy this level of thinking.  Can I see it is a good game and do I understand why a lot of people like it?  Yes. But it encourages way too much AP which really drags the game.  I think the components really need an overhaul as well.  And I think it is a little overrated here on the Geek.  Just because it's heavy, doesn't mean it's brilliant.  I prefer an overall more elegant design. And lest anyone think I just didn't like it because I played poorly, I did come in 2nd in a game of 5.  It's just not to my tastes.

Rated a 2 based on "It's not you it's me" ... Not at all the game for me, played it, appreciate it as a game, but it's just too much attacking and destroying what you've done for it's length.  If the playing time was half or less of what it is now, it would be more tolerable.

After playing a ton of games with unclear rules and edge case situations, just reading the rule book alone makes me sigh a relief (for a rules lawyer like myself)! 

Not as tight as a typical Euro and plays long. But, there plenty of options, strategies and lots to like here.

After one play it's hard to tell, but it's surely a great game, i see one inconvenient, the picture of the game are so ugly is difficult to describe it, if some day there will be a realise with nice picture more interested to buy this game.
After playing 3 games , 2 in a row i think it's a very good game i give an 8 , this will be 8.5 but the picture are so ugly :( hope the second edition will be prettier, the game has also a little problem you must count 1h per player but with experienced players you just don't feel the downtime because of the dynamic in the game.
i will recommend to play it with 4 players, i try with 3 but don't like it.
Maybe one day a will try with 5 experienced players , to avoid the 5/6h of game.

Seldom do I meet a game where even a reading of the rules triggers a "Wow" moment, let alone finding out that the actual play is as much fun. All that keeps it from a 10 is the time investment, and the tactical learning curve, which threw off my friends in the first play ("How do I win this?").

I don't subtract more than a half point from perfection because the playing time can be scheduled, and 3 hours with friends having fun is worth it, and the learning curve is a symptom of the game's tactical depth.

RATING: 6.5
Only one play so far, which was agonizingly long (about 4 hours for 4 players, 2 newbies and 2 already familiar with it) but on the other hand, it was not an unpleasant experience: the extreme swinginess of the game and the ample opportunities to make life difficult for other players meant that you never felt like just tuning out even if you were trailing abysmally. My main problem is just the difficulty of reading the board: it takes such an amount of effort to constantly calculate the dominance of other players (and the possible shifts in dominant triggered by a given action) that it's genuinely difficult to tell if you're in a strong or weak position, and your actual position on the scoring track is not a reliable guide either. More experience with the game would obviously help in this department, but with such absurdly long runtimes that's just not going to happen.

RATING: 7
The game has so many ways to beat the other players down that the chief determinant of your success seems to be the extent to which you get targeted.

Dominant species is one of those games that is both strategically rich yet also thematic. The components might just be wooden cubes and cones, but the multitudinous actions you can take evoke the theme. The more players you have the longer it takes, and the more chaotic this game becomes. It is brutal and truly a great 'survival of the fittest' style game.

RATING: 6
Played once, terrible experience.  One player (playing the Arachnids) chose to spend most of the game attacking me and making secret deals with the other players against me, only because I was near his tiles.  Playing the Birds I couldn't figure out any strategy to counter act these attacks especially since he was always well ahead of me in the initiative track.  

Overall this game takes far too long especially if you find yourself being the victim of an attack that your species really can't parry.

After giving the game another try with a better group of gamers I have decided the game is worth keeping.

Wonderful game. The one of the best I played in 2010. I'm a bit worry about the advantage that the top of food chain species can have at the final scoring.
I hope to rise this rating after a second game. Will see.

UPDATED 1: Still a bit worried about the power of ties in the final scoring. Eager to play it again.

UPDATED 2: My worries continues to confirm. The end game ties seems really unbalanced.
Also the cards that gives an extra AP, seems to give a huge advantage to players who get them. And the time they appear are important and out of control. Still a great game.

UPDATED 3: Another game. I don't know why, but each time I play it, more chaotic and out of control seems to me. Also the continued racing to get a place to score, seems a bit wrong. I'm not sure if I will keep such an high rating with more plays. 

To chaotic. My rating lows from game to game. I enjoy this game less and less every time I play it.

Dominant Species is a brilliantly designed game that adds several layers to the area control mechanism. Not only do you strive for area majority but you must also adapt your species to the area (by adding elements to your species) and adapt the area to your species (by adding elements to the area). In addition, you must take into account that elements not chosen by the players "flow through" the game machinery and may eventually harm the species and/or their habitats. All actions are chosen through a programming mechanism, where they are available on a first-come first-serve basis, thus requiring both planning and prioritization.

Most of the gameplay can be predicted, with the random element draw adding a healthy dose of uncertainty for the players to adapt to (pun intended). The cards may be a bit too swingy but there are not more of them than the players can memorize and prepare for. They remind a bit about the calamities in Civilization, that add regular chaos to the gameplay.

All in all, this creates a highly tense and interactive gameplay, where the players constantly must be on their toes to defend where they are weakest and attack where they are strongest to maintain their comparative advantages. In the end, it's all about the survival of the fittest.

With more plays, this might be my favorite game where it's possible to attack people.  It's between this and Game of Thrones (edit: now Blood rage as well), but this is more of a pure euro otherwise.  The up to down, left to right action activation after placing workers is genius.

I'm reluctant of giving the perfect score for a game after just one play. I must play this game again, and hopefuly, we won't have a player that wants to make the part of the chaos factor of evolution,and we could really test the true flavor of this marvel.

This is one of those games that is so well designed, that you wish more games could learn something for it. One of the best games I've ever played.

5-player game. Very fun, but keeping track of domination is a pain. Surprised by the many points at the end game. all leading players got hosed by this.

Domination switched so quickly that I was the one not getting to play a card due to a players incorrect calculation of domination.

A good game in spite of this, but I cannot see it going above an 8.

The game is to bland for this, a bit abstract and the domination calculations you constantly have to make makes this a hard game to push above 8.

RATING: 8
Only played this once, so thoughts and ratings could change in the future.  The main problem that I have with the game is one of expectations.  I expected a game in which evolutionary / ecological themes were pronounced.  I did not find this to be the case.  It's a fun enough game.  I like the "worker placement" aspect, and the "more you'd like to do than you can do" aspect.  The unfolding of a turn after placing "workers" (i.e., action points) is very clever and tightly designed.  ...But I don't know.  I just feel like other games provide these sorts of mechanics in a way that I find more entertaining: Chaos in the Old World (area control), Alien Frontiers (placement), Twilight Struggles (choice stress).  And I feel other games do a better job of capturing the ebb and flow of "species" in a more thematically accurate way (Brittania).  Good game, one that I'd always be willing to play.  But you won't learn anything much about ecological systems / evolutionary processes.

Edit: +1 after more plays.  Putting aside the simulation aspect of the game, this is such a tightly designed game.  The "choice map" and how it interacts with the animal types is fantastic.

Edit: A few more plays, and this game continues to rise in my esteem.  Such a tense game, and the spooling out of player choices is brilliant.  Hovering on bumping this up to a 10.  Still don't consider it very informative about natural selection in general, but so what.  The game is fun.

Edit: Final choice is an 8. Terminology of the board really gets in the way of playing, and the domination mechanic is always clunky. Also not a huge fan of the final scoring of all tiles.  Somehow doesn't fit the v. careful planning that is associated with the rest of the game.  Still, has a high fun quotient, and the worker placement "programming" is v. cool.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In this worker placement game, themed after six species fighting for survival, players play to improve the durability of their species, cause glaciation, add new tiles, migrate and reproduce. It's also an area control game, and there are cards that give you a wide range of bonuses. It's a game that clocks in around 4 hours. There are some interesting twists, in that you can use a worker to reserve a future action on the glaciation action.

I have played once with 5 players. I'm happy to try again, to understand the nuances of this game, but the time could be a factor. I also have some concerns about the wide swings caused by the dominance cards, and the targetting of the leader. The game does keep you engaged throughout.

[b]Dominant Species[/b] by [person=6331][/person]
2-6 players

Worker-placement, area control, variable player power, modular game.

Players choose to play one of the following: Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibeans, Spiders, or Insects. Each has its own special ability. Each will struggle to dominate the other across the various shifting environs of planet Earth.

[i]Natural selection[/i] is a fantastic, even phenomenal game subject, however, the game is a far cry from a simulation (not saying that the designer was going for that). Its theme is pasted on as with many eurogames. This is something that I´m not so enthused about. For me, DS doesn't ruin the gaming experience, but I sure would like to find something that is a tad closer to the real thing.

Perhaps one of Phil Eklund´s titles will appeal more, such as Bios:Megafauna. Must try it out first.

All that said, I´ve enjoyed the game.

Have played with 2, 3, and 4 players. All numbers are okay, however as the number of players increases, I find a greater need to utilize a game timer. It also becomes more chaotic and questionable whether good play is properly rewarded. 

Actually, it is here that we stumble across one of Life´s most fundamental questions: [i]Do we pull our own strings, or not?[/i] 

Perhaps in this the design remains most true to its subject matter.

Game Tips:
#1
Some complain that there's a lot of counting in this game. A timer would limit that, as well as use of double-sized cubes to denote 5 species, such as the 5 VP cubes in Tigris&Euphrates. If you own T&E, borrow its big cubes. They should have been included in DS from the get-go!

If you don´t like bash-the-leader play, victory points could be tracked by placing VP counters into pouches, thus keeping player score totals hidden akin to T&E.
#3
If possible, purchase the first or second printings of the 1st edition. They have very clean art with pastel colors. The game state is easier to read than in later printings.

Blech, too much calculating and numbers and the theme really doesn't match the mechanics at all, to the point of being counterintuitive. Whyis it just as likely a desert winds up being nothing but water as a wetlands? Or a wetlands likely has no water at all?

As it turns out the different land types mean nothing in terms of play except for the numbers printed on them... :\

A good game, but boy, the theme is simply no there, and it's just madness level number crunching at the end of the day.

After one 2 player game, i will raise/lower it when I have played more games!

Update: We played the second game wrong and i would have rated the game against with a 9, but as you get points for every tile at the end of the game (which we did not do) this balances the end game scoring a lot which increases the rating for me to a 10!

cant rate it a 10 as you really can't relax having this game and will need some free time after a round of this one :)

This is the style of game that improves after the other gamers have played five or six times.  Unfortunately, very few others are willing to invest the time to really learn this game.  It is right up my alley though.  I enjoy the complexity of choosing my actions from a long list of choices.  I like trying to guess when others are going to choose certain actions, so that I can try to manipulate the entire turn through my choices.

Do a favour to yourself and use dices to mark the value of dominance

Very good game and with a very nice theme that match the mechanics, love the quality over quantity majority of dominance but it is a pain to constantly calculate the dominance every time it changes. If I can think of a better way to speed this aspect will rise the rating to 8.5 (maybe with dice showing the value of dominance?).

Seemed very chaotic but not random, and constantly have to adjust the tactics to the long term strategy , I think that one player can bash on another very easily...

On first play, I enjoyed it until I lost! And it didn't feel like four hours were passing, although it did feel a bit familiar...
On second play, I realised I just couldn't keep a handle on the game in the last two or three rounds. I just lost track of what the hell was going on!

Problems for me: I think a lot depends on what other players do rather than necessarily what you do; it's difficult to get an overview of the game just by looking at the board - I don't know if that's the design or what; there are a few Dominance cards that seem to cancel each-other out; it also feels overly long, and for no particular reason.

Maybe I've just played too many "Who's got the most cubes in this bit?" games, or maybe I just don't like them. I can't help admiring the mechanical design of the game, but I feel like I should enjoy it more than I actually did.

I wouldn't say the theme is pasted on, but it's a typical Euro game. The mechanics are nothing new and the game is really long. I played a game with six people and the game lasted five hours. There's also too much downtime between turns. 

Maybe I would have enjoyed it more with less people because there was a span of 45 minutes in which I had nothing to do but play on my phone or stare at the board. It's a 'point-salad' game. There's so many ways to score that it was hard to determine a good strategy.

Yikes, I don't think I have anything new to say in terms of comments. I think there are a lot of really great mechanics in this game, but game length, for what it was, was a bit to much for me.

Game would probably be a 10 if it didn't bring out rage in players. Inevitably you will do something to someone that makes them mad the rest of the game. It's difficult to find players for me that will not, at some point find rage.

Dominant Species is long and complicated, but for all of it's many moving parts, they are all intuitive and easy to learn, and it manages to stay very engaging throughout it's entire duration, resulting in one of the best area-control strategy games ever made. Perhaps its most amazing achievement, however, is that all of its various deterministic mechanics interact in incredibly complex and even unpredictable ways that perfectly evoke its ecological theme. 

Approved.

RATING: 10
Beautiful and original game. 

It could have some small disadvantages for my taste: it is less predictable than I usually like (a bit of luck, e.g. when drawing the elements, and a bit too much depending on which opponent players choose to "punish"). 

BUT... 

The game is really different each time it is played and it develops in ways difficult to foresee: this is somehow part of the disadvantage I was mentioning above, but it is also its strength at the same time, because very thematically it represents the struggle to become dominant in a dramatically changing environment. 

The games are beautifully tense and fun. It is also nice to see how a single game develops, almost like reading a story that we are writing while playing it.

The length that could have been a problem is solved easily using the official variant of discarding 4 event cards (you can find it here on BGG).

The rules are beautiful and logical, without exceptions, intuitive because very well matched with the theme. My eight year old daughter manages to play DS, and to play well! No doubt about any rule (she can count dominance at a glance, surely better than me :) ).

All considered, if you like boardgaming it would be a mistake to miss this top game, IMHO. Very recommended.

UPDATE
What a pity I can't give this game more than 10: wonderful. All disadvantages I mentioned above disappeared after really getting into the game. I suggest playing with the variant mentioned above: besides being a faster game, it becomes more balanced. And what a game! Every single step is a tense and beautiful choice. Every game so different from the other. It is thematic. Rules are crystal clear and logical. After playing more games you, like me, may come to regret that 10 is the maximum you can give to a game here on BGG :P

Very long game where things are changing a lot from turn to turn.  You have to keep your wits about you because if you are not paying attention to many aspects there is a chance that your animals will not have food sufficient for them to exist in that space, or a glacier will fall on your group of animals (happened to me and I cried).  

I do love this game because you do not have to plan super long term, but every decision you make will drastically change the course of the game.  It is fun watching how much the board changes over the course of the game.

For a 3+ hour game, it went in seemingly 1.5 time. Probably because the 13 or so stages of each round were so well-delineated. There are some beginning of game balance issues -- I drew arachnids, and the shellfish prawn tokens pretty much kept an invisible profile until round 4, which really benefited me through no effort on my part. But the actions flow into each other so well, and there are several different delightful mechanics at play.

O Dominant Species é um dos meus favoritos desde a primeira vez que joguei. A ideia é levar a competição da natureza pra mesa: cada um joga com um tipo de animal, de insetos a mamíferos. Todos têm sua vantagem evolutiva, e quem estiver melhor adaptado a cada terreno domina a parada - pelo menos até a tundra cobrir tudo e matar todo mundo. Ameritrash total: é normal cometer alguns genocídios contra adversários ao longo do jogo. Recomendado para jogadores mais avançados, biólogos e para quem gosta de sacanear o coleguinha.

There are few games that can keep me at the table for more than 4 hours. This is one. With 4 players, the only count that I recommend, the tension is at the perfect level. Players must strike a delicate balance between adapting their animals, tailoring the board state, and populating select tiles. The domination cards initially appear too swingy, but their power is gradually revealed to be a necessary check to a range of possible strategies. The physical enormity of the game matches its complexity and depth.

Possibly the heaviest game in my collection. Would kill an elephant if the elephant tried to catch it. Find that this is a game that plays faster the higher the player count (due to the glaciates popping pretty much every turn). Brutal and complex, but wholey satisfying.

A combination of Caylus, El Grande and Settlers of Catan, which takes as long as all three combined.

I can see it is a good game, and the mechanics are interesting and mesh well. My only play did feel shorter than the time it took. But even then, it was too long.

After playing several more times on the iPad, I find the game length is quite manageable there. I'd still be wary of playing with other people though.

Chad Jensen has some very neat design mechanics. This is no exception. Once you play it a few times where you get to the point of seeing the big picture, this is a fun game that leans to the lighter side. A lot of people think it's too long. I find the length to be perfect when all players are familiar with the game (i.e. they all have at least 3 or 4 plays under their belts). Great for family and friends alike.

Very well crafted game!
If I would have to compare this game to anything, I would say El Grande on steroids but this one plays different (even then any other game).
Two dimensions of area control with worker placement works beautiful. Heavy game but not too heavy. There is a lot to plan and I don't see that much of chaos like some people says (play only with 3 players). 
On the other hand it's quite long and fiddly. First game took us about 4 hours. It's definetly not for everyone.

A good game overall, but sometimes it feels like even the most watertight strategy can't even hold together for more than 1/8th of a turn.  

Some may view this as a strength and others as a weakness. Personally, I view it a a bit of a weakness as it presents only the illusion of strategy to the players. It's almost as if the game is playing itself at times.

On the other hand, it is a neat system, and so I do appreciate the game from a "game experiment" point of view.

UPDATE: Having played it several times, I think its "more fun than fair".  The reason for this are the cards, which are overpowered.  Not exceptionally so, but enough to swing the game too sharply in favour of a player who doesn't deserve it.  Sadly, my rating has dropped slightly on this game, though I will still play it and consider it to be fun.

Played this just the once with 4 players, Random species given (Arachnids, Amphibians, Reptiles and Insects used). I had played a brief game previously but two players had to leave so game was cut short, but i was playing this time with 3 newbies to the game. We all really enjoyed the first go, it is by no means a short game, though with setup and explanation took us approximately 5 hours, we all feel this will cut by at least an hour when we play it next and we definatly will play this again soon. I had borrowed off my friend and will be seeking to buy this for myself now, I amj hoping to play it again on the weekend with a different group and see how they enjoy it.

[i]Dominant Species[/i] is at heart an area majority game with worker placement, variable turn order, and some brutal direct conflict. It is NOT your average Euro- it is highly complex, requires constant attention and is absolutely cutthroat.

DS has fierce direct conflict both on the map and during action selection: this starts immediately and does not let up. There is no obvious way to ally with others, either. It suffers a little from "six-player chaos", but plays very well with four or even five.

Good game, but very heavy and has a long duration. Thus it will not see frequent play with my group. More's the pity...  :-(

Game is very interesting and at the same time complex and easy to learn. The setting is very well bound with the rules and you really have the impression of a fight among species/classes.
However, there are some major drawbacks, according to my tastes, here:
- game is ONLY tactical. Probably there is some strategy towards the final scoring, but honestly any card can dramatically change the entire board
- components are cubes! Small animal meeples would have improved my game experience dramatically
- it is somehow boring to continuously check who is dominant in each region

Holy crap, what a brain burner. Heavy, little randomness. After 1 play (finished half an hour ago after 3.5 hours), I feel pretty exhausted. There are a lot of rules to distiguish, and as a consequence of the permutation, I found it hard to keep the overview and understand the consequences of my moves. 

Although there are a couple of funny "take that!"-actions, it's first and foremost a game where player sit quietly contemplating. While I can appreciate the neat implementation of the theme (some rules really make sense from the ecological point of view), the excellent mechanics and even the artwork and the quality of components, there is just not enough [i]emotion[/i] in the game, although I imagine that may change with experienced players. Anyway, so far it's one of the best games with worker placement mechanic I know. 

Judging alone by my desire to play the game again, I rate it a 7.

Concerning purchase: The game is relatively expensive, minumum 55 EUR. Big minus. German edition goes for the same price.

[b]Dominant Species[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]I really didn't know much about Dominant Species other than it was known for being notoriously long and nasty. I played a 3p game and there was plenty of conflict, but it made sense in the context of the theme. And while the game was long, it took 3 hours including teaching, time flew by as turns moved quickly. I could see the game grinding to halt if you had AP players; there are some folks I probably wouldn't play this with. I would definitely recommend learning this from someone who already knows the game, it would be a beast to learn from the rule book.

As far as game play goes there are so many moving parts in Dominant Species that I'd recommend watching some videos if you're interested in learning the specifics of game play. What makes Dominant Species stand out is how all of the interconnected actions make sense both in terms of game play and thematically. The rise and fall of a species is definitely a turbulent event and Dominant Species does an amazing job capturing that theme. 

While the presentation may not be the best [i](it looks like an abstract game, minus the terrain tiles)[/i] the graphic design and layout is excellent and definitely aids game play. The action spaces on the board are placed in sequence making it easy to see how each action you take will effect later actions. The combination of building the terrain in conjunction with area control is difficult to balance, making for some really nasty surprises if you don't plan well or if potentially catastrophic events take place.   

Dominant Species is by far the deepest area control game I've played and has a steep learning curve, but still provided an enjoyable first play experience. The game is not overly complex, it just takes time to understand all the nuances between the different actions and plan accordingly. I really appreciate that this game rewards repeated play and strategies and synergies between actions will continue to unfold as you gain more experience. Dominant Species is one of those games I would recommend to anyone, at least for one play, and hopefully a game I get to play more.[/i]

Number one: do not play this game with 1 species each in a 2-player game. Maybe do not play it as a 2-player game at all. Best to play with 3 or more players, so everything isn't taken so personally. In a 2-player game you are constantly targeted by the other player...never makes for a good game. The game is unbalanced in a 2-player game and doesn't work perfectly. But I suspect it is way more fun and interesting with more players and a much tighter game play as well.

I want to play this game. I really enjoy this game and crave playing it, but it is lengthy and strategic. I am discovering about myself that if I am going to play a game by Chad Jensen, I will need time to play and I will need to take breaks. This game and Urban Sprawl are so great to play and so immersive that I get exhausted. Take a break, go get lunch, come back play for awhile, take another break...get the idea! We are talking about the evolution of species after all...this game takes time to make it to fruition. Another words, if you are feeling like you are way behind and probsbly going to loose...you might pull out a victory 5 rounds later...but if you don't take a break you will exhaust yourself and miss out on a great game.

One play at a game night.  Enjoyed it.  The quickest short reference for me to describe it would be El Grande of Empires III, which works for me because I love both those games.  I like worker placement.  I would play this again at a game night, but the long play time would make this virtually impossible to play at home.  Plus it's more harsh than El Grande or AOE III in terms of removing others' pieces which doesn't fly as well at home. I've already got 2 or 3 long games sitting unplayed, so I won't be buying this.

This is supposedly an up and coming game.  It's somewhat complicated to play predictably (there are no dice, so all randomization is based on where you place you action pawns on the board.

RATING: 4
Worker placement (Disclaimer, I don't like WP games). A bit long  for what it is (and expensive with below average components compared to similar games, though you do get a lot of wood in the box). The random event cards are slightly too powerful and important IMO, and there are other random factors such as element draws and terrain draws for "wanderlust."

The mechanics feel gamey - it's very much an abstract bag of mechanics dressed up as a 'game about evolution'. In particular the way you get points is mostly unrelated to the theme.

However there are some interesting mechanics and a lot of depth to the game, it's just not my cup of tea.

Yes! What a marvelous game. The true war/euro hybrid. I find it beautifully balanced, and a wonderful combination of work-placement and area-control. Not for the faint-hearted as the scope for screw-you moves is enormous.  The 6-player remains a bit too chaotic for me to internally track everything that is going on (and leaves each individual player with too few actions per round), but the 4-player is superb.

A strategic rich game of cube pushing via worker placement actions in order to score points via area majorities. Your animal can only exist on tiles that have a food chit next to it that matches the food types you've collected for your animal. So there's your first mission for your workers ... place on the spots that get you food types added to your animal and then on spots which put out food types that your animal likes. Then you can place workers to add cubes (ie species of your animal) out onto the tiles next to a food type you've chosen and place workers to allow you to kill off competition and then also to migrate between tiles. You can also allocate workers to score a tile, hopefully one that's high scoring (wetland is worth more than desert), one that your animal is best adapted to (more food type matches than others, because then you'll earn a bonus card) and lastly have more cubes (species) on than the others for the actual VPs themselves. So there's lots of ways to get on the board and lots of ways to be removed from the board. It's fluid and hard to assess how a turn is going to pan out (and whether you'll still be able to score well in the region/s you were hoping to, as that happens last). There's also points of offer for placing new tiles to the board, expanding the tundra (ie reducing a tile's score power) and having the most cubes on tundra. Lots of strategies towards scoring, lots of ways to go about things, and only 5 stinking workers to do it all with. Which provides a rich decision making process each turn. It can be hard to assess the best way to go about things, and following the implications of what each player is planning to do as they place their workers, and that's what introduces the downtime. The trick to enjoyment is to play with players who'll play by feel and don't need to work out all the implications (too many times anyway) which will keep the game moving. The worker decision process hides that it's just a cube pusher to a degree, but it can get a bit same-y by the end stages. Well worth playing however, if just to explore the different way the game can evolve.

Pros: Lots of choices and options that match with a great theme plus a little bit of asymmetric powers.
Really like being able to alter the board or your species.

Cons: Cards sometimes uneven/over-powered and the end game is almost a whole other game; few people willing to play full length. Can upset people when you chose to attack/block.

Finally had the opportunity to play this game with other humans (not on the I-pad), and thus got the sense of how the game play flows.

Better than I expected.  The theme seemed to work to me, and I thought that the flow of the game had certain nuances that created opportunities to succeed.  This is not a casual game where you can do well unintentionally... rather it is a game where you are fighting both the other animals and the general forces of extniction and evolution.

The flaw of the game is its length.  This is not a short game, but seems to be guaged at an hour per player.  This means it is a game that should stay on the shelf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A nice game of worker placement. There are some unbalanced things, like changing the turn order only moves you up one notch, as being second is ok there is no reason for the second player to do it, and the first player stays first. The cards giving you an extra action pawn may also be very unbalancing, especially if one player gets one early and the other two cards are at the bottom of the deck. Theese cards are also stronger for the insects and mammals than the "middle" species.

A great worker placement game that although scary at first as there appears to be a lot going on, once you understand the worker placement track, the game goes fairly smoothly (especially due to the great player aid).

Too heavy for my group, but I'm keeping it because I hope we can work up to it one day. Great combination of area control and worker placement.

Absolutely love the different cards and the amount of interaction.

I think in the future I will try to do the abbreviated version of the game with the extra pawn cards removed.

2-3 player: My sense is why bother, but haven't played enough to say this conclusively.
4-5 player: Ideal.

This is a big game. It plays as long as an 18xx, and has a grand epic feel to it. It is probably the heaviest euro I've played, comparable to Hansa Teutonica, but bigger. If it were shorter it would get a nine or ten easy.  

And really this is a little more game than I am usually interested in. I'm more of a two hour game person than a four hour game person.

RATING: 7
This amazingly deep game surprisingly has a lot of similarities to Age of Empires III--Caylus-style worker placement with top-to-bottom execution, fueling an area-control game on a map board.  However, in addition to the usual "most-cubes" majorities, the game adds the concept of "domination", which is based on your race's attributes compared to the terrain's.  Majorities give you points, while domination lets you use game-altering cards.  Players elect which regions score, but choices become difficult if you don't dominate a high-scoring region.  Overall, I did enjoy it, but it's a LONG game, and quite the brain-burner, so it's not something I would seek to play often (I find it comparable to Die Macher on that level).  Also, domination is constantly in flux and not trivial to compute--makes me wish there was a computer to do it.

RATING: 8.5
I've played maybe half a dozen games of Dominant species so far (all to conclusion) and I must say I'm impressed.

With any less than 3 players the game can drag on a bit, especially if people don't bid regularly on the domination area. In fact I don't think any of our games have been played in under 3 hours

I would say that the game is balanced since I've played as most of the 6 creature types and not won as any of them so far and still I enjoyed every game - they always seem to end up nail bitingly close!

The game itself does remind me a bit of diplomacy in a wierd way when 4 or more players are involved. There seems to be a lot of double dealing and secret agreements between the various animal groups that I find entertaining especially when they all stab each other in the back. Although I feel this maybe down to the cutthroats I play with as opposed to any game mechanics...Although it must be said the day the arachnids and the birds work together is a day I don't want to live to see!!

Update 1/16
Still a favourite, we now play a version where all cards are wiped at the end of each turn so if you didn't bid domination that turn you won't get a chance to play those specific cards later-this has halved playtime and has allowed me to introduce far more players who if keen can opt for the 'proper' game later

RATING: 10
Really enjoy this. It reminds me a lot of El Grande.

Two levels of majorities working together: most cubes is important to score points while most elements in common with the terrain will allow players to choose the all mighty Domination cards. The timing considerations usually present in worker placement games are also at play here, but are not the focus of the game. 

Dominant Species is about adapting to the ever changing environment, recognizing the most significant threats and taking actions to minimize them, while trying to make your competitors' life as hard as possible.

It's a fairly heavy game, with a level of complexity that sometimes is hard to distinguish from just plain chaos but I think that's a conscient design decision. For the game to work, it's important that apparently unpredictable things keep happening, forcing players to constantly adapt their plans.

Great game!

RATING: 7
A conflict oriented worker placement area control game. Simple to learn, difficult to master. A long, but enjoyable experience that fits it's theme extremely well.

It plays surprisingly well with just 2 as it does with 6. Lots of decisions to be made through out the game. Be warned, people prone to Analysis Paralysis might curl up into a ball and die from decision overload.

The visual appeal of the game could be better as it is a bit minimalistic, though it's for functional purposes of game play. 


One of the best games I've played this year.

edit: after some time now I find this is still a very good game, but not as compelling as others. I need to be in the right mood to play this over some other available choices at game night. Because of this I've lowered the score to a 8.5. An exceptional design, just not a really compelling one that gives me the itch to play it often. The 4hr+ game length also hurts how often it gets played.

Don't get me wrong, this is still an exceptional game I'm just not sure it's a 10.

edit: sold due to many other friends owning it and that it doesn't get played often in my home. Might purchase 3rd + edition at some future time.

Mixed feelings on this one. Amazing design, super super deep. Both plays I've experienced with live humans have been longer than I would prefer for a gaming experience. Would get faster with more plays, but that would require more investment than my group (and probably myself) would prefer. Will likely keep though just for the once in a while experience.

Update (9/13): Played again last night. Great game. Hard sell. Still really long. Definitely worth keeping even if rarely played.

Update (6/14): This game definitely has flaws. Probably the largest of which is the relentless bash the leader phenomenon. I still like it quite a bit, but I'm not pursuing plays with quite the same vigor. Also, still really long.

Evolution, the natural process of adapting to ones enviroment, so why is this game so laborius. Mixing worker placement with area control is a nice idea, I like the way that Belfort managed it in such a short snappy edition! This game takes ages... Maybe my patience needs to evolve but if I'm sending my breed just to get eaten up and destroyed by the landscape, I get a sense of dissapointment. It sounds like I'm bitter and I'm not very good at the game, but that's not it I promise. The calculations that go in to the game are as intense as any good Euro game, however the pay off isn't as satisfying. I admit I didn't get a true handle on this game, so maybe I just wasn't fit enough to survive this game. Now a streamlined version might just work.

Didn't make the cut- as this beast of a game was too heavy.

So many choices, all extremely impacting. Not for a casual gamer, at all. But pretty damn deep, with an incredible amount of tension right out the gates with 5+ players.

Fiddly as hell to set up, but maintenance not so bad after that. Also? Pretty long, but not in a bad way, since even during other players' turns, you'll be spending a lot of time considering your own moves (or SHOULD be)

great game. Components are high quality, but not especially pretty. Very functional though. Gameplay involves 2 kinds of area control, which makes it hard to win control of many areas -- you're always in jeopardy! (Which is a good thing.) It can be really hard to work out what other players are trying to do, and what's going to happen when the actions are resolved. A very 'thinky' game, for sure.

One of the best (if not THE best) strategy games out there. It may look like an innocent animals game but be warned: it is made by a company that usually makes tactical war board games and this is exactly what Dominant Species is at its core.

Only problem? It's a long ride (easily 3 hours), and exhausting to play because of its complexity, but it is a really rewarding experience.

Have now played twice and just scratching the surface on this game. However I really like the decision making process, the high interaction level, and the theme. It keeps everyone engaged and each decision is important. There is a definite learning curve, and it can be a bit long, but if you are into this type of game (which I am) the time is not an issue.

RATING: 7
Interesting game with some unique features and mechanics that can be a fun and enjoyable experience (if you are thick-skinned,) but a game that you can't take the results seriously.

Extremely chaotic and from the very first move your fate is at the whim of other players. Most of the event cards (Domination cards) are so powerful that leave little room for any meaningful long term strategy. Also, there are bound to be lots of player influencing attempts in the game, and leader bashing, "See, I'm in the second to last place, destroy that other player's species".

Good stuff! Highly thematic, deep, tightly intertwined mechanics of action planning and two different overlapping area majority objectives. Brain burn! Throw in variable but open power cards and variable animal class abilities and you've got a recipe for a hugely replayable and immersive experience. Rating based on extensive rules & forum research, iPad app experience, and physical copy bits fondling. Rating may rise with additional plays against actual humans, which I hope to do very soon!

Fantastic worker placement game where hexes are scored using area majority and points defined by type of terrain. When a player chooses to score an area, the person with the most cubes gets the points, BUT the player who's animals can eat the most effectively gets the opportunity to play a powerful and sometimes harsh action card.

One of the charms of this game is that even in a turn where you get wiped from the board, you can bounce right back on the next turn, so long as players know to not kick you when you are down.

The severity of these effects can be off-putting for new players, and bad or inexperienced players can choose to victimize the same player over and over again with the powerful card effects, ruining everyone's good time.

RATING: 6.5
The first turn is daunting (and would probably be a nightmare if you were going to try to walk through the rules), but the pieces fall into place quickly with someone familiar with the rules.  A combination of a number of genres: worker placement, area control, tile placement, bit of resource management...it works well.  The theme is fun; one or two of the species seem to be at a slight disadvantage, but I'm sure there is some undiscovered strategy that could capitalize on their abilities. Not sure I'd recommend it to a Catan fan, who might be fooled by the mere appearance of hexes...Dominant Species is a good deal meatier, to the point of being a bit of a brain burner. Game time is longish, but totally manageable.  

Update: Played again.  Hasn't aged well.  Not great for larger groups as it absolutely drags.  Can think of many other games that last 2+ hours I'd rather play.

A nearly perfect game.

Worker placement meshed seamlessly with territory control, with a lot of flexibility and player interaction.

Dominance scoring isn't exactly difficult, but it's the one part of the game that doesn't feel streamlined.

Two other complaints: 1) the victory points feel a bit too weighted towards the last turn 2) regression impacts adaption strategy a bit too much when not all species are being played

I have never seen so many different mechanics combined into a game that still work so well.  I'm also so impressed with how well the theme fits with what you do throughout the game.  The only thing that keeps this from being a 10 is the fact that those cards can end up being really over-powered sometimes.

Not a bad game but, like Agricola, it gives me more stress than pleasure. There are just too many subsystems to integrate into a functioning plan. Experience really matters and, like Agricola and Puerto Rico, I'm unlikely ever to gain that requisite experience.

As I wargamer I'm not intimidated by the volume of rules, rather these rules feel like the player is fighting the system more so than the other players. All these wheels-within-wheels subsystem do not, in my opinion, make for an elegant design.

Personal desire to play: 3.

A lot going on here, a real brain burner. It is a deep game with lots of small decisions to make. Beside the area control, (majority scores bonus), there is domination which is the cross reference of your race's attributes to the terrain, as long as you have one piece. It is domination that let's you take the bonus cards. Domination changes with each placement and become tedious to calculate. You select the scoring region which can be come difficult as the games progresses.

Ultimately a game that I have little desire to own, and would only play occasionally.

Such a heavy game! In terms of its physical weight and the level of its complexity. So many things to look out for and things to juggle and do in this game.

I am surprised I got through more than one playthrough aside from playing it wrong the first 3 times and playing it right the last time it was a beast to teach and to play.

I'm giving it a low score because of its complexity. I think it can be very fun if you don't let yourself get into AP and just let the game flow.

Try not to control everything and just go with your gut feeling and it won't last 4-6 hours, maybe 2-3 tops!

Személyes kedvenc, de még nem volt idő, és kedv nagy társaságban kipróbálni. Az értékelés két személyes játéknak szól. 
Több személlyel a játékélmény egyenesen arányban van. Végre sikerült 5-n kipróbálni. Nagyon-nagyon élvezetes volt, de a szabályokban voltak szürke zónák így az egyes taktikák véletlenül, vagy sorsszerűen alakultak illetve ebből a  pontozás - amolyan - nem tudatos játékból adódót. Vagyis én nem ez alapján játszottam
Ezt legközelebb orvosoljuk.:)

The game is not as complex at people have you think, at least the rules are not. The most complex issue with this game is the fact that all actions are available from the very beginning. Of course, some of them do not make a whole of sense at first and chosing them as your action might be quite foolish, but it is a long and winding road until you figure that out for yourself. The game is quite abstract and so are the 'depictions' of the species, dominance and so forth (cubes, cones), but the flow of the game and the dynamic of conflicting species is very on theme and has been a surprisingly involving experience even if compared with games which are actually trying to be thematic (and are not). The final scoring is kind of overpowered in my opinion but that is not too bad. The game takes a long time and really melts your brain, I wonder if you could play it with less cards (12 and the Ice Age card) ? Anyhow, a good game and if it was not for the time and effort it takes to play this, I would have rated it much higher.

EDIT: Played again and the same thing happened AGAIN. Rush for empty tiles at the end and too much chaos that really unbalanced the game. Rating slipped down. For a game that takes this long and feels so intricate, there are too many things and special abilities that throw the balance.

RATING: 9
A top game for me. I wasn't expecting to like this based on what other people have told me about it. But, played as a six-player game, it was one of the most amazing experiences. From the start, it's a slugfest, and you're messing with each other. Allies don't emerge and grudges don't really form because you're opportunistically impacting the map and messing with the leader. Well-balanced, hard choices. The game is intimidating at first, but a good tutorial really can make the difference.

I think my first play through we missed a few small details related to the rules but overall we played as we should have. You have to really think before making game decisions.

Dominant species is all about survival of the fittest. You control a group of animals there tries to adapt and survive just before the ice age sets in. It’s a Euro style game but a very aggressive one, so if you aren’t into cutthroat games this is definitely not a game for you.  If you on the other hand like games where you try to survive under harsh conditions and fierce competition, then you should give this game a try. It’s fairly easy to learn but hard to master, there is a lot to keep track of and at times can become pretty fiddly.

Love this game, but I have some issues.  I played once so far.  5 players.  2 had severe AP.  Game took 6 hours to play.  I had alot of fun, but the last two hours were a bit daunting.  I need to play with faster players.  Calculating dominance also becomes a bit of a chore after a while.  One of the guys in the group suggested placing a dice on the spot with the number of the current highest dominance on there, so when you place, you can see if you beat it or not, without having to recheck dominance.  It may help a little, but when elements change, you still need to recalculate dominance for each player.

I admit that I wouldn't even look over this game because I was so turned off by the title and theme, but once I got over that...

A fantastic worker-placement game with a bit of a war game feel.  I am a big fan!  At this point I only rated it a nine because I've only played it once; however, I expect my rating will be going up.

Each species has a slight difference to each other which should increase replay ability a ton.  The down side is that a good chunk of time is going to need to be committed to getting it on the table.  Our first game ran about five hours, but I hadn't even finished reading the rule book by the time we started playing our first game - and I needed to teach the other two players.  If you can tolerate a longer game or two in your collection and you don't mind aggressive worker-placement games get it before it's out of print!  You'll be happy you did.

This game probably deserves a higher rating. I have a lot of respect for the design, but not that much desire to play it. I find it to be too long and chaotic. Possibly if I got more familiar with it, it would seem less chaotic because I'd know how to prepare for some of the game's apparently-unpredictable swings. (Later—nope. I just don't like it, and have drastically lowered my rating.)

Amazing euro-styled game with much more player interaction than what most euro's offer. The sheer amount of choices and interactions that players can make to benefit themselves and hinder others is designed nicely. In addition, a very cleverly placed clock in the form of chosen card-events makes the game go as quickly or as slowly as the players choose. 

If you like euro-games but want more direct confrontation and interaction, Dominant Species is for you.

Brilliant design with a lot to sink your teeth into. Very deep game with intense brain-burnage throughout.

Having to track the dominance cones was a bit tricky and time-consuming, especially when something happened that affected multiple animals on multiple tiles.

The game is wonderful and fun though, and I feel very much worth the extra effort.

** Rating upgraded from 9.1 to 9.6 after three plays. The only thing keeping it from a 10 is that it is too math heavy for almost half the people I game with. To me the constant fun is worth the constant math, but unfortunately the intensity keeps it off the table for all but a select few of the groups I game with.

One of the best area control Euro game with an interesting theme. While plenty is happening which could be difficult for you to keep up, it still all comes together smoothly and in a thematically sound manner. 

Can be a brain burner, tense with lots of direct take-that bashing/slapping of opponents but extremely satisfying till the end.

I was hugely exited to play this game. However it turned out extremely AP prone ; Doing two times the action pawn thing is just ??? mechanic for this game (I mean first placing & then resolving). The animals don't evolve enough for my taste. I didn't like the scoring mechanism. Checking the dominance constantly is also quite annoying. Art is bad & not so clear, although I wouldn't mind, if the game was otherwise OK. Tried to like it with different groups, but its just more horrible each play.

Epic area control game with so much to track and so many ways to win. Tile placement, pawn distribution, action selection, movement, decay, opponent blocking, turn order, varying powers (advantages), and game changing cards (I wish there was more variety here). Amazing production quality. Will take multiple plays to appreciate, but surprisingly easy to learn and teach. Requires thinking a few rounds in advance. Many ways to play and win. Phenomenal theme integration. This game resets the bar for excellence in area control

TRULY EXCELLENT GAME OF ICEAGE SURVIVAL
I purchased this on a GMT sale based on the notion that I would get it to the table much faster than yet another 2-P wargame.  The reviews I read led me to expect a deep and lengthy game - which for the most part it is.  What the reviews in no way led me to expect that Dominant Species is an OUTSTANDING FAMILY GAME!  My first play was a learning game with my 9 and 12 YO sons.  They both quickly grasped the mechanics and at the end of play declared the game to be a GREAT game (of course they did join forces to pound Dad).  My 14 YO daughter watched the first game and insisted on joining us the next morning.  It was a school holiday an no-one asked for the TV/XBox/DS/PC/etc - we finished breakfast and there they were at the gaming table, ready to go!  How's THAT for GAMING GOODNESS!  Dominant Species is definitely a GMT HOME RUN.

I like everything about this game. For me the graphics are just right, not overwhelming and yet aesthetically pleasing. The rule book id one of the best that I have ever read.

Some complain about the length, but with practice 3 to 4 hour games are possible.

The game itself has very high re-playability. There are many strategies. One tip is to not beat the leader down too hard as yesterdays enemy is todays ally. You never really want to be too far ahead or behind in victory points, so there is a bit of tight to walk.

The game experience is better with experienced players.

RATING: 5.6
This is a crazy insane analytical game.  There is tons going on but it is really hard to keep track of where your place is compared to your opponents.  This is truly as euro-y a game as you can get and a very good design.  however, for me, it just isn't that fun.  It's a epic type game that just really doesn't feel all that epic.   The dynamics of the board are way to fluid.  Thus, it really hard to plan a strategy on others turn because the board is so different by the time it's your turn to do something.  In turn, this creates long down time and heavy analysis paralysis.  On top of all this, it was way way to long.  Our three player game took 9 hours which is way to long for what it is. If the game could be refined to a real 90-120 minute then this could be a fine game but as it is, I would rather play 3 or 4 shorter Euros in the time I could play this, save the constant frustration and happily scratch the same itch.

RATING: 6
Rating after one play. 

This is one of those games where you spend most of the first session just pulling the levers to see the myriad of cause and effect. Reminds me a lot of Age of Empires III, but about 30 per cent more complex and 30 per cent longer. Whether it's 30 per cent deeper remains to be seen.

It's transparent enough once you see a couple rounds of scoring. And there are many trade-offs in efficiency, long-term potential, and scoring. 

It is quite swingy. Dominance cards can open enormous opportunities, depending on the timing. And scoring is heavily weighted to the final turn, which feels a bit wonky in such a long game. However, it does seem that with experience, the swinginess would be mitigated. So my rating may rise.

Marvellous, just marvellous.  3 tight tense games so far.  A bit swingy perhaps, but the chaotic nature of the game is a big part of its appeal, as is its sheer brutality.  Tough decisions throughout with player turns generally followed in short order by a curse as they realise they've done something stupid.  The only thing preventing this from getting more plays is of course the time factor - we have so far clocked in at anywhere between 4 to 5 hours.

RATING: 7.9
Its a while since I've rated a game quite high but I think this game probably deserves it. It is a worker placement/area control game, very much like Age of Empires III, but here the area control feeds into a system of wild cards which create quite dramatic effects across the board. The game is a little wild and it has to be played somewhat frenetically (don't let anyone who suffers from analysis paralysis play).

I've only played this game 5 or 6 times, despite having owned it since August 2012 (the most recent play in March 2015). I think it's a very good game, bordering on excellent - yet I feel no desparation to play it, and no "that was great, I should play it again soon" feeling after the game is over. For me it's a once-or-twice-a-year sort of game - it's very intense, and always seems to go very slowly even when there doesn't seem to be excessive AP (my most recent game, with 4, took around 4 hours, and yes we were using 4 or 5 domination actions each turn, although I was struggling early on and deliberately chose tiles no-one was dominant on a few times). It's a great design - worker placement and area control with an awful lot of "take that" - and a very intense play experience, and I can well see why many people love this game. Yet I don't personally, even though I do admire it and am glad to have it in my collection.

RATING: 7.5
I really wanted to love this game but can't. There is clearly a lot to it - great theme, interesting mechanics, lots of choices, probably too many choices. Even that's fine, the problem is tension. You don't really feel the tension of doing one choice over the other because whatever choice you make, you still feel like you are just "shooting in the dark" - at least that's how it felt to me. It's just very hard to tell how any combination of decisions are better than another combination of decisions. I mean you can head in a general direction but can't really tell most times how much more or less one set of choices versus another is getting you. 

I know games that give you fewer choices but you feel much more tension in those choices and you really "feel" the effect of one choice over the long run versus another.

Moreover, games takes a long time, to me there are games that scratch the similar itch of this one but in a shorter time frame - Automobile, for example.

UPDATE
Based on second play, I am going to bump to 6.9 rating but contradictorily say it has an appeal that's higher than that rating. I would love to be able to play this more and would play this almost any time [maybe not 3 in a row]. 

If this could be played in under 2 hours with 3, I'd give it a 9 plus. If it could be done in 1.5 hours, it would be my first perfect score.

Dominant Species is an epic area control and worker placement game. It's very tactical as you don't know what elements and cards will be coming next turn which I suspect may be its downfall. 

The game is quite long and bad for players with AP. The randomness of the card and chit draws and lack of ability to forward-plan is a major drawback. However, the game is engaging and there is high player interaction.

Awesome game. The rules are very simple to learn and explain but making the best use of the different actions in combination with each other is what's difficult. The game length will likely keep it from being played more often but it is a great experience when it does hit the table.

(-) Sometimes the final scoring tends to "wipe out" all effords made in the first couple of rounds of the game

Although my first Impression was absolutely positive, a few games later, I am not that much enthusiastic about it. The game is long... very long : if you want to play smartly, you have to spend a lot of time thinking about your planification. If you don't, it's just a luck-based game... 
But the worst aspect is that you actually cannot really plan long scope strategy because every time I played, the last turn was the only one that really did matter. 
I really would like to love this game, since I love the way you plan your actions... but it is still a few steps far from being a game I wanna play during the required 7h...

I just don't get this game... I'm all for stretching my brain muscles but there is just too much going on here. Length is also an issue, can people really spare that much time playing a game as draining as this? (looking at the ranking I guess they can).

Add to this the extreme changes in board situation, thanks in great part to the domination cards, and I would rather play Terra Mystica. That said, there is no denying that Dominant Species is a clever design, but too close to a wargame for my taste.

update after 2nd play - 5 - much of what i wrote below is true - its a bit like power grid in that the flow is appealing but it is not well designed. it is also gonna feel v samey v quickly i think - sure things chg from game to game but what u do is exactly the same - simple area majority. oh and its also MASSIVELY calculational and very prone to king making

rating after 1 play (4pl) - 6

some nice ideas but too fiddly, too much AP, too random, too long. would play again but doubt rating will rise - it's just a ineleganty extravaganted area-majarity game and not my cup of tea

also i dont like the unthematicness of it - for example deserts can contain more water than wetlands!! the only diff between the 'terrain tiles' is the scoring and that feels v clunky

A rather easy to learn game with endless amounts of strategies that will constantly change throughout the game. One of the frustrating aspects to this game happens after the planning phase: players place their action pawns amongst 12 or so possible actions with a strategy in mind. By the time the actions toward the end of the execution phase are taken, the game board has completely changed. Regardless, Dominant Species is a fantastic game with infinite replayability. The game mechanics, in my opinion, are perfectly designed and flawless. This game is complete from beginning to end and provides everyone a great experience. Probably my favorite board game.

RATING: 3.9
I feel like I should rank this game higher than what I do, because I think this is a genuinely good, clever and well designed game *system*. However, after two games a few major issues have surfaced. For the positives: I absolutely love the basic game mechanics and the way they implement and complement the theme. The dual area control mechanisms, worker placement, the conflict, the glaciation, etc... all work in a fluid and intuitive system with layers of strategy and tactics, with plenty of randomness to keep you on your toes.

That said, the game is just too chaotic and fiddly. That isn't so bad, but it's compounded by having a lot of downtime. It's an AP players nightmare, which makes a long game drag even more. I have two major issues that smite my rating even further: a few of the special cards and the balance of the different racial powers.

For the special cards... the same issue popped up in both games I played. How often this will pop up is probably rare, but the fact that it's happened in both of my games left a sour taste in my mouth. In worker placement games, one of the keys is getting an advantage over the other players in the number of workers you have to place. How that is done in this game is through the special cards. That's fine, except for the fact that there are very few cards that actually do this. I'm guessing that to counter this, when a card is triggered it can give multiple players an extra worker. In both games (one lasting 6 hours and the second 4 hrs) only ONE player was excluded from the extra action card in the very first first turn. Also in both games: another card that would reward an extra action didn't get revealed until the last and then second-to-last turn. This meant that one player was basically playing the entire 5ish hours with fewer actions than everyone else. Both players in this situation finished dead last. That is a substantial issue, and at least in one of those situations there was nothing that player could have done to prevent it (In the other case, the player hadn't played before and didn't realize it was such an issue to look out for).  

As for the special powers on the races- in my limited exposure to the game, it's felt as if a few of the races have decidedly more useful/powerful abilities. I know this is a source of debate, but the amphibian's special powers have the ability to be extremely powerful in ways that a few of the other races can. When you compare the insect's and Spider's powers which influence one hex at a time to the amphibians, whose power helps in every hex there is water (and the birds power, which can affect nearly the entire board). On top of the range of usefulness you also have random elements that can supercharge the amphibians. While it doesn't happen every game, if the random filling on adaption, abundance and wanderlust makes it so that plenty of water is able to hit the board the amphibians become superpowered, easily winning dominance throughout the game. That is compounded when water isn't available in adaption. In a long game, having a random draw determine if a race is superpowered or just average seems unacceptable. 

Overall, I'd say that I like the ideas in this game. But I will probably turn down playing it again. I really dislike that a random drawing of a special card can give one player a huge disadvantage for nearly the entire game, and random drawing of chits can give one race a substantial advantage. Will those situations come up every game? No. But they have come up in both games I played. I'm sure in games where a random element doesn't cause an decided advantage or disadvantage for one player, it is a game that belongs in the top 20 (though probably not my personal top 20). I've seen the other side if it, though, and I'd rather play a game where everyone competes on even ground.

 Only one play with four players. Wonderful and original theme, nice mechanics, but just too many of them. So many choices leads to a weird first game with a steep learning curve.
 Some dominance cards seem completely broken (and others completely mediocre), especially in six player games, where you start with only 3 actions and getting an additional one early is crucial. In a 4 player game every player gets five from the beginning so thats not so a big deal.
 But my biggest grip is the length. It took us about 3 and half hours to complete the game. It adds up with the fact that some players will probably get out of the competition barely passed the first half of the game.
 Waiting for a second game, because i really liked worker placement mechanics and elements influence along the game.
 ----------
 Update after another play, this time with six players. I really wanted to like this game, but unfortunately its way too long for me. I have no problem with a 4+ hours game, but this one gets repetitive after the first half. With six players there is a bit too much downtime and, given the length is easy that one or two players will get out of victory race with an hour or so remaining to the end. Some factors will influence the length to a great extent, specially the sorting of the dominance cards. If some of the worst cards came out early, they are probably going to be hanging a lot of time waiting to be picked, which results in a longer game, specially in a six player game, when you do not have actions "to spare".
 The game definitely plays very different with 4 or 6 players. But i think the biggest issues arouse with six players. The unbalance between the dominance cards is a joke. Really. As i thought, the additional actions cards change the game when shown early. When you have 3 actions per turn, gain another in the first turn (not very rare) gives you a boost to do 33% more every turn, or a 66% more if you get a second in the next few turns, much more difficult but still posible (it happened to us...). Some of the cards are good, but only in a very specific situation. Others are simply broken in some scenarios. And a bunch are really worthless to pick if you cant get a pack of VPs when scoring before choosing the card.
 Still i think the base game is very thematic, has some wonderful mechanics (abundance, adaption, regression,...) which require to plan in advance and a deeper strategic play than most of similar euros. Unfortunately the length and balance issues kill the game for me.

This game just gets better each time I play it.  Very deep, strategic but filled with heaps of interaction.

Can be prone to AP, but seems to flow well once everyone is up to play on the rules.  

My first game was a wash, kind of left me feeling meh.

But I am happy to say that after my third game within the same group this game is great.

So to potential buyers, don't give up on the game just after one go, to get the feel you must give it at least 4 games to really understand the mechanics.

This game in my book is an excellent game, well done Chad Jenson!

RATING: 7.25
23-04-2015. Rated after 1 play. Dominant Species is a 'heavy' euro. It's like El Grande x2, with worker placement to get your influence on the board. In the game you try to gain VPs, 'obviously' for controlling areas.  There are two types of 'control', one based on the amount of cubes you have (scores you VPs, depending on area number 2 and 3 in influence can also get VPs), and one based on the 'adaptedness' of your animal to the area you are trying to score. If you match most resource types in the hex you are trying to score you are 'dominant', resulting in you getting a special 'dominance' card.

You get more influence, move influence and score areas based on a worker placement mechanism. In addition, you can use a glacier to basically 'ruin' areas. 

I like it quite a bit. It's complicated, but fun.

Choose a type of animal (Mammal, reptile, amphibian, insect, arachnid or bird) and then try to evolve and adapt better than the other players to your constantly changing environment. 

This is a heavy, brutal worker placement game with a ton of choices for you to make each turn. You will need to perform many calculations over the course of the game which might wear players out who are not used to heavy board games. Also, there is a lot of take that between players. Now if those two points don't discourage you, please give this game a try. It is simply excellent. No two plays will ever be the same.

I don't really see the attraction of this game.  This may partly because I am a biologist, but the theme just feels totally pasted on to an abstract area-control game - El Grande, not known for having a strong theme, feels much more thematic. The only real benefit I see is that is a playable 2-3 player area majority game, which is rare, but the fun factor:game length ratio on this one is very low.

Deep, nuanced, interactive, strategic, immersive.  

What a wonderful game.  I'm not a huge worker placement fan, so DS is a bit of an aberration for me, perhaps because the worker placement mechanism supports a dynamic, interactive area control core rather than a creation of a standard VP-engine.  

I love the story arc that is created as I watch the world and its creatures change.  Deeply thematic and engrossing. Brain melting. Challenging. Rich.

This is my #2 game.

But, to be fair, we were calculating dominance when it didn't really matter - and so our game dragged on a bit: 5.5h with 5p.  If I could play this in 3-4 hours it'd be enjoyable (so I'm very interested in trying a reduced deck of dominance cards on a future outing.)
--Sept2010-- Second play was ~3h with 3p.  But had a runaway leader.  Not sure if the runaway leader is an inherent problem with the 3p configuration, or whether it was just a symptom of the fact that we're not very good yet with the game system.  Still very glad to have ordered the game.
--Oct2010-- Third game was 6.3 hours with 4p.  Yeah, one of the players consumed the majority (yes: more than the other three summed together!) of that time - but, still, that's too long for comfort.  I like the game in the 3-4h range.  By 5h, I'm beginning to care very little who wins.
--Jan2017-- Sold.  Not missed yet.  (Though I expect I could play a friend's copy if I really wanted to reprise it.)

I don't think I'll play this again.  As the game progressed it became apparent to me again why I dislike worker placement so much -- there were so many selections (6 players/four tokens each) that there was a lot of garbage that needed to be selected and that part of the game just became interminable.  Actions on the board weren't any better.  There is just too much to count and calculate before taking your actions.  If you and your buddies give a damn about winning this game is going to take hours and hours to play with six players.

I did well in my final game, but frankly not through my efforts.  As in real evolution my species were largely at the whims of fate and got breaks due to pretty arbitrary reasons that I had no control over.  Given their entire primary food source was wiped off the board it made no sense I was even in the hunt.  The guy that had never played before ran away with it and admitted he had no idea why.

Crazy chaotic board by the end of the game.  Very difficult to assess game state.

I wanted to like this one but it just didn't turn out.

One play. two-players with each controlling three animal families. I can see stuff in there I like, but I don't think I like it as a two-player game. Way too many things to keep track of with three animals controlled. Probably best with three or four. The cards seem very powerful.

7 -> 4  Finally got another play in. 4p game. Halfway through I decided to sell this game. I was not having fun. I still love the theme and a lot of the mechanisms, but there is way too much conflict for me. Direct and indirect conflict.

This game feels like a masterful design from the moment you begin to learn to play.  Consistently, players learning the game feel the weight of the game, and yet have few or no questions to ask for clarification, due to the unambiguousness and concise rules.

Here again we have one of the mechanics I enjoy: area control in which you coexist, most of the time, in the same areas as your opponents.  But in addition to that, we have two types of area control going on.  The typical competition to have the most units in an area earns points for the winners in that regard, but simultaneously there is the competition for dominance by being the species most suited to the environmental elements present, for the prize of being able to execute a powerful action card.  The latter system, in which you compete by manipulating both the elements your species prefers and the elements present on the board, is immensely satisfying.

It should be noted that this is a long game, and extremely long when analysis paralysis comes into play; there is much to consider, from very early in the game and only increasing.

I think this game is a perfect blend of theme and mechanics.  It is fun, challenging and there is always plenty to keep you thinking about your next decision.  I found myself very engaged even when it was not my turn.  The biggest draw back for my friend group is how long the game takes.  When you play with a group of people that all like to make sure they are making the most of every action available, this game really drags out.  None the less, this is the best game I have bought in quite awhile and I am thoroughly pleased with it.

The end conditions is annoying as it can really drag if you can't dominant anywhere.  The survivor scoring is huge and can let someone run away with it if they are not stopped.

I have a bit of mixed feelings toward this one, but with a definitely positive result overall. It's extremely susceptible to analysis paralysis with a huge amount of options and requires constant weighing of available choices, and yet all our plans can be easily thwarted by enemy action. Has very high - maybe too high - interaction and dynamics, and ultimately not being attacked too much is as important as good play. If you manage not too look like a threat, in consequence gaining points from other people's domination, and pull a strong ending, you are likely to win. It's a bit too long for me, with 4 player games in experienced (but somewhat thinking oriented) gamers lasting just over 4 hours.

RATING: 8
A very solid game, with the somewhat admirable yet curious feature of being almost dangerously long for modern board gaming. I like the aesthetic and the cover art, on the whole in this category (of sneaky/combative area majority scoring games) I think I prefer Age of Empires III (more fun) and Confucious (more interesting). Does kind of surprise me how highly rated it is here on BGG, which I would choose to take as a positive sign that long, serious games are by no means out of fashion. Stiff competition, I would have thought though, from faster playing weighty games, such as Hansa Teutonica.

RATING: 7
Rated if I've got the time to invest in a long game. It's an engrossing ride that keeps you engaged throughout.  That said, I'm probably inflating the rating somewhat due to the lovely production, how well developed the game is and because of how simply it plays. At it's heart it's an area majority game driven by a worker placement mechanism. So... worker placement cube pushing. Nothing really new here apart maybe for the scoring - which is... involved and will have you counting cubes on tundra tiles like crazy as the game nears its end. With domination rewarded throughout the game by powerful cards the game sometimes develops into a crazy unpredictable almost mess. Keep your eye on the theme and you'll be okay with it. Don't covet your cubes... sorry... species too much, because at the whim of another player they could very well be gone in the blink of an eye. In fact, players will be performing a great deal of hitting or scoring other players based on the perceived leader. If you're thinking about your move for more than a few seconds then you're thinking you've got more control than you really do.

One thing I really like about this one is the excellent rulebook and really easy rules that make this easy to pick up after a long break between plays.

On the downside it's long - about an hour long to make it to the table regularly. I wonder if removing five dominance cards and 20% of the species cubes would just bring it down to comfortably under three hours. Another option is to remove one card and clear the dominance cards not taken at the end of each turn (plus remove 20% of the cubes) - turning the game into a five turn game. All this might be unnecessary for me if reports prove correct that the game time can drop to under two hours with experienced players.

Additionally there's an awful lot of counting and bookkeeping throughout. These are moderate distractions in what is otherwise a fine game. Players need to balance each other out, but beware of the table talk - it slows down a slow game even more. Players will hopefully balance out players dominating - there's plenty of scope for communal whacking. Which is why the game can't be taken very seriously. There's big points swings in the cards and the placement of a cube here or there.

The closest game I can come up with that's similar is El Grande. You push cubes around and score areas. Cards influence stuff. Except El Grande takes about half the time and involves much less counting. Dominant Species has this double counting aspect - the number of species is easy, and then there's the dominance determined by multiplying the number of counters around a hex by the number of counters of that type on a player's board. It's constantly changing. It works, but it works like an old Citroen 2CV works as a car. It's clunky and after a while it becomes annoying.

Dominant Species could almost be a civilization game in a way and I am looking forward to exploring further. Speaking of civilization games - Sid Meir's new civ game came out the same year as this, is about as fiddly and runs about the same length. It's tricky to decide which I'd rather play. In fact, with all the choices I have for a long game - Struggle for Empires, Through the Ages, etc, Dominant Species has a lot of competition. The easy rulebook and ease of picking it up after a long break might be what ends up making it the game of choice to bring off the shelf.

Worker placement with area control, as in [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=105&Itemid=1]Age of Empires III[/url][/i], but different in feel and in almost everything else. Formally this is a good game: It works properly, the mechanics integrate very good with the theme, and there are a lot of meaty decisions for the players to take. Besides, its rulebook is easily the best written one that I've ever seen: Concise, clear, well presented and explained and full of examples. What a pleasure was to read it! All these elements would normally be enough for me to give it a high rating, maybe an eight. That's right, if the game is good, it wouldn't matter for me that there is nothing really new in the design, with the exception, perhaps, of the the double majority aspect (species and dominance) that gives so much to think to the players. Nevertheless, the playing time exceeds by a mile the limit in which I would never turn down a game, at least for one of this kind. Maybe it is just that our gaming group meets on working days after work, when attitude for long games is not at its best, but a time comes when you start to feel like that the game should have ended a while ago. So even when the game is very good and engaging, it is probably the one among my favorites that I rate the lowest, cause I like it and enjoy playing it, but just not for that long . That having been said, I'm sure that trying a variant that reduces the playing time will catapult this game for me to a  very high rating. Perhaps even experience alone would be enough to solve this problem, but in the meantime I probably establish a time limit or remove randomly ten cards in my next games to shorten them. This would not only consume less playing time, but also would introduce an element of incertainty, since not all the cards would come into play, giving the game more replayability, expectation and tactical feel.

Dominant Species is actually a highly tactical game which doesn't easily forgive stupid mistakes. There are so many approaches to the game – be it actively killing your rivals through competition, undermining them to extinction by desolating their natural resources or just continually displacing them through glaciation – and a range of different species with different perks that the resulting game is a great experience. My friends have commented on the lack of 'active screwing-over' in the game despite half of everything you do resulting in your opponents' species being displaced/killed. I also love the feeling of the box - 2kg in such a compact box screams quality to me!

Bought from BGG auction in like new condition.  Really enjoy this game.  Feels epic like TI3 but with worker placement.  I love all the options you have when it's your turn to place and how you can compound various actions to have a productive turn. A very cutthroat game, and I love the cards that can change things on a dime.  This is not a game I will win often, but I look forward to the experience and challenge of building up my species.

Played the nearly final version at GMT East.  This is an absolutely great game - not only is there planning and strategy, it is an incredible amount of fun.  First time play for me - 2nd for most of the rest - easy to pick up the rules and get into the game.  And FUN!  There were times we laughed so hard we couldn't breathe.

Area control, resource management - and awesome bits.   Although I realize what I saw was a final "test copy" the potential is there for a game that rocks, rolls and looks good.

4-12 Back to the table with this after a long hiatus - and I enjoyed it even more than before.  I felt like I was really struggling with what I wanted to do, I was definitely lagging way behind, but was able to do enough with the final scoring that I moved up to second.  More importantly than that was the fact of how much fun I had playing.

FUN ★★★★✰
A lot of decisions to make at each turn. Also, a lot of changes in the situation. It's sort of a big mess full of coloured pawns. Time goes very fast and all players had fun.

RULES ★★★✰✰
The rules are well writeen without any issue to understand. The choices make the game a bit tricky, but not the rules. One or two rounds are needed to have a grasp on each possible action.

IMMERSION ★★✰✰✰
I understand it's a Euro-type game. Howevers, moving cubes and cones is not really immersive. Nor are the choice of animals. The theme is almost not present in my taste. I prefer some kind of minis that at least reminds you that you are playing a game taking place 90000 years ago!

DEPTH ★★★★✰
I played only one time and I am sure there are lots of possibilities and strategies. We'll see over time though. After the second play, I find the game a bit random in the sense that it's a huge chaos where it's quite hard to plan anything. I decrese the overall score by 0.5, but it's still for sure a very solid game.

RATING: 8
Nothing particularly innovative, but the cornucopia of mechanisms is blended together beautifully, creating a stirring narrative of rise and fall. Species arise organically, migrate away from glaciation, explore for better opportunities, and struggle to adapt to the elements and avoid extinction. Half the game is watching your animal, adapting appropriately, plus getting the majorities and dominance cones, and half of it is placing the tiles, glaciating and seeding/maintaining the board with resources appropriately to make it more hospitable for you.

People like to compare this to [i]El Grande[/i], and that is there with the 5-card display and the importance of managing and timing your cube reserve. But the biggest analogue is [i]Age of Empires[/i], which just comes off as a wannabe filler next to this tour de force. AoE has half the action choices (turn order = initiative, token draft = Abundant + Adaptation, shipping = Speciation, discovery = Wanderlust, merchant ship = Glaciation, warfare = Competition) with little interaction between them, whereas in DS, every single thing messes with the board and the other actions in a complex and subtle manner. Shades of [i]Mammoth Hunters[/i] too with the glaciation action and take-that cards.

I normally wouldn't bother with such a complex inter-mingling and relentless layering of mechanisms, but there is purpose and an evocative dynamism behind them, instead of only dryness in others (Caylus, anything from Chvatil). I enjoy seeing the board morph and develop (in 3 ways: tiles, resources and glaciation), animals rise and fall, and every thing in the game thoughtfully furthers the theme and gives your actions meaning. The components might be Euro-austere, but such rich meaning is infused into the game that they do not need to be figurines or animeeples.

What also impressed me was how 1 single point of difference between the animals creates meaningful asymmetry throughout the game by changing how players value different action spaces, and enabling subtle combos, which I still haven't completely figured out yet (Birds = Initiative + Migration; Mammals = Glaciation, then tie-break majority). Again, so much more meaning than games that slap 1-5 "variable player powers" rules that give little payoff for tacked-on rules complexity (AoE expansion).

Worth at least one play to check out the subdued but tight marriage between theme and mechanisms, feeling almost like a history lesson. Wouldn't play this on a dime as I do with nearly any other game due to the sheer decision complexity, but I can get warmed up every once in a while.

Update: more of an experience game, because as a leader-bashing game, the stakes can get too complicated. Hence, would remove the AP-gaining cards to shorten the experience.

4+4

I almost want to give this a 9 considering how much I enjoyed it, despite area control being one of my least favorite mechanics.  You can't have thin skin to play it as there is some meanness, but with the right people, you don't even notice the time melting away.  It says something to the game's design that even a bad early blow - such as being knocked down to 1 cube on the board - doesn't doom you to a game-long torture session with no chance to win.  Love the mechanics for dominance as well as the scoring, especially the end-game scoring for dominance, which you are building towards all game.  The production values of the later printing are an improvement over the original ones.  The board and cards aren't going to blow you away, but they're pleasant to look at.  Really good stuff.

Game is very fun, very strategic, even girlfriend for some reason enjoys this game (which I did not expect).

Would rate this higher but it does take a long time to play, also does not scale well for more players, I only recommend this with three.  More players introduces too much chaos and reduces the amount of strategy involved.

After a few more plays I find the king making aspect of the game ruins it for me.  There is also a huge luck factor on which types of element tokens show up.  This can completely ruin someone's game if the right/wrong tokens show up or too many of them show up, etc.

1 play:
I liked the theme implementation and the slow pace of the game, which nevertheless is not so big on downtime. I liked that not every decision is crucial, it can be, but... you mostly can do something about it with the overall butterfly effect feel of the game. I liked graphic design in live much more than I though I would. Clean and bright. Also, the rules are so clearly written this doesn't feel like such a heavy game (FFG this is your obligatory reading assignment).

What I'm not sure about:
It's an area control with added stuff hence - it's both interactive, highly tactical, but also opaque. 
Maybe one reason I enjoyed the game is because with winning strategies so blurry, your position opaque and really no real clue except what happens this and next turn, I could relax and just take it as a ride. So I hope it will stay as a ride with further plays and not some VP tweaks engine. 

3 games in: 
I've explained the game on the 2nd and 3rd game and my head hurt. Too fricking demanding. Won't teach again. The rules are so well written, one should be able to learn from reading and they will. 

EDIT: Lowered game for 0.5. On repeated play the theme hid itself in the background, also 5 player game was a bit too stressful (less actions, more screwage). There's a funny thing with the cards - some are made to better in the start game and some in the end game, if you get theme in opposite parts of the game, they are less of an impact on the game, which feels like they weren't played. 

EDIT 2: played once more after a while. Lowered rating by 1.0. We tried some table talk and you can't do it in this game - too much overhead, too much thinky stuff that buries the game (probably group's fault). Anyhow, while I like it better than El Grande and is an euro with actual interaction I'm unlikely to play this in near or intermediate future. 

EDIT 3: new graphic design is hideous and so so so average and common. This game has a ton of stuff going on so functionality of visual design is a necessity - game state must be easy to read. Original art had this.

Great game, but it never hits the table due to the game length and always having to bring in new players. Now a days, I am torn between decent 90 minute games and intricate brain burners. I love the deep decisions and mechanisms in this game, but I am not sure if that outweighs the other factors?

First time play with 6.. it went for over 4 hours.  One person scored 40 plus points at the end with Ice Age card...  Knowing the game now and how each card works.. I think we'll definitely play quite differently. 

Rating likely to rise depends on how much quicker this game be with less and more experience players.  I think 6 is probably bit too many.. love to try it with 4 or 5.

A heavier game, although it doesn't take forever to play. I love the theme, I love how dominance and adaptation are handled within the game.... my only complaint is how mean it is (and I love mean games, but some folks I play with don't).

RATING: 9
A great match of chaos and strategy.  You never have enough action points to realize your plan and the player competition for action positions and the world map is a wonderful interaction of pure forward thinking strategy.  A great game between 3 to 5 but with 6 you better have very experienced players as the game can slow to a point of losing a touch of the fun but otherwise a very enjoyable game.

RATING: 8
Worker Placement, Area Control. Initial rating based on an incomplete play; I think the rating will go up with a full play, but I think I'd avoid 6p again -- probably 3p or 4p is the sweet spot for this game, for me.

Lots of moving parts in this system and it seems like there are many strategies to pursue.

Not sure I need it. Evolution covers this genre very well with a fraction of the time and complexity, despite how good this game is.

Big meaty game, elegant and eventually simple mechanics, cut throat, fun. Sounds perfect? It is a length that makes it touch and go for an after work evening if anyone gets AP.

Talán megtaláltam azt a játékot, amit eddig kerestem. A legjobb és legélvezetesebb eurogame-t. A játékkal játszva ugyanolyan érzés fogott el, mint a Battlestar Galacticával töltött idő alatt. Fantasztikus játék a Dominant Species. A játékosok hat állatosztály közül választhatnak és azok fajait próbálják dominánssá tenni a játék közben többfajta területből épülő térképen. Akcióválasztó a játék. A sokfajta akció nagyon jól ki van dolgozva, mind nagyon hasznos és nagyon fontos. A hatszögletű területekből felépülő térképen egy ötletes megoldás adja, hogy ki a domináns az adott részen. De közel sem egy egyszerű többségi játék. A játék tökéletesen működött ketten is és a játékidő sem volt túl hosszú. A játék legnagyobb erénye a dinamikája. Hihetetlen érdekesen alakul a fajok jelenléte a területen. A dominanciák fázisonként is nagyon változhatnak. Nem érzek visszahozhatatlan hátrányt. Hihetetlen izgalmas, fantasztikusan jó játék a Dominant Species. Több játékossal szerintem még érdekesebben alakulhat a sokszínűség és ha sikerül kipróbálnom és jól gondolom nagyon érik az első 10 pontos eurogame.

[2011-12-29]
Négyen kipróbálva is nagyon jó, ugyanolyan hihetetlenül dinamikus és tényleg nincs reménytelen helyzet, ez szuper benne. Egyedül a hossza durvulhat el sok személynél. Megadom neki a 10-est, mert megérdemli.

A véletlenszerű föld változatot nem ajánlom, mert kevés egyeddel kezdve nem érzem elég kompenzációnak azt a pár győzelmi pontot.

I'm not convinced (yet) that this is a game of skill. The elements outside of the individual's control seem to overwhelm those that aren't.

If you play this game in a fairly regular group, and keep records of the game results, I'd be interested to look at it. Are there players who are simply better at it, and finish high consistently? Or are the results all over the place, with the same individual finishing 1st/2nd half the time and 5th/6th in the rest?

A lab mate had us play this to see if it would be useful as a teaching tool for evolution. It would definitely not be. Apart from that: the play was a bit fussy and unintuitive, but we got the hang of it and had fun. Would play again, though it wouldn't be my first choice.

I didn't expect this game to be as good as it is.  I have not played any games previous to this with this type of mechanic and really enjoyed a war game where you are planning ahead but many things don't go as planned so you have to do your best to adapt.  Works great with just 2 players too!

[i]Game of Games, for Euro Gamers[/i]

Challenging, deep, and well designed.

[b]Length[/b]: Justified. To shorten this game would probably be to cheapen the experience.

[b]Flavor[/b]: Fitting. Adapt or die.

[b]Strategy[/b]: It seems you must respect both strategy and tactics in this game. Go in with a strategy but be prepared to change it as you adapt or die.

[b]Components:[/b] 2nd edition is minimal but stylistic. I like the "art project" look and the cartoony artwork on the domination cards.

3rd edition appears to take itself a little more seriously. The styles of the cards etc seem more like a hodgepodge in the 3rd edition rather than stylized around a certain theme, so not sure I prefer them, but the terrains etc definitely "pop" more and are pleasing to look at. Overall 3rd edition looks more polished despite (IMO) sacrificing a bit of style

But either way this game is about the gameplay first. The components do their job and then step back and let the gameplay shine.

[hr]Still a great game, but it isn't getting played that much for one reason: Chaos in the Old World Horned Rat expansion. Everytime I'm taking a game to game night and look at my shelf and consider Dominant Species, I see the faster, sexier area domination game that is also less taxing on the brain and body and grab that instead. That's a shame, because Dominant Species is more than satisfying.

Overly long and repetitive with huge swings based more on what chits, tiles, and cards get flipped up over most of anything else you do.  The worker placement section is nice, but there are too many better games that do this kind of thing.  The main board is a more complicated less fulfilling El Grande.  The cards can be ridiculous.  Thematically, it has all the language, but ultimately it is pretty abstract, so if I want a random sim I'd rather play American Megafauna and if I want an abstract representation I'll play Trias.  As for any kind of growth of your species it doesn't have anything on Evo, and if you just want an awesome dinosaur game play Tyranno Ex.

It is long, and slow, with mostly tactical, reactive decisions.  There is no middle or end game, you just do the same thing over and over again.

Played on iPad with AI only. AI is quite dumb, looking forward to 2018 q1 reprint and play with human. Will adjust rating after playing with human intelligence.

The Good:
- Indirect player interaction (by worker placement and area influence, my favourite mechanics)
- Direct player interaction and conflict
- Easily understood theme and doesn't feel pasted on.
- Can play up to 6 players
- Asymmetric player power that feels well balanced.
- Kingmaking usually doesn't happen in this game (Compare to say El Grande, which you can see happen from time to time) because the scoring track is not a good representation of the final standing.
- Low luck.
- Meaning decisions to be made every pawn.

The Bad:
- Will find out when I get a chance to play with human.

One of the few heavier games that I've played that I've enjoyed.  Of course, being worker placement and area control does influence my rating quite a bit.  It's fun and very combative, but in the end, it's quite long (4 hours for three players) and there are some REALLY powerful cards in there.  Solid game though.  And oh yeah, I won my first play, so that helps too!  But really, quite thematic for this type of game and although I was spent at the end, I had fun.

Tentative score. I don't usually like complex games because: 1. newcomers can't win; 2. it takes long to teach; 3. it is hard on the brain; and 4. players don't get it fully, and don't feel in control, and have less fun. Played it once, did well.
Did the extra complexity add to a better experience in the end? To be honest, no. Evo is just as much fun.

RATING: 7
This is a beautiful game. And the rulebook is excellent, one of the best I've seen. I only have two problems with the game:

(1) Trying to figure out how all the different phases of the game interact, and what you should actually be trying to achieve, is very complicated. I expect a person would have to play the game half a dozen times to get a good feel for this. Helpful would be a one-pager discussing basic strategy for newbies: half of it pointing out important interactions, and half of it suggesting 2 or 3 basic strategies that a player might want to adopt.

(2) Tracking Domination is a big pain, especially once players get 4 or 5 elements on their displays. It made my head spin as I have to glance at the board, and at every player's player sheet and then do the math. And this calculation can change many, many times during a single turn. Yikes.

RATING: 8
Dominant Species is a fantastic worker placement and area control game. The area control aspect consists of two layers: the first layer is just a numerical majority and will score you some VP's. The second layer consists of dominance: the species who is best adapted to a certain area is dominant and doesn't score VP's but gets to pick a card with mostly very strong effects that affect the board state. A great aspect of the game is that scoring an area costs an action: you might score an area where you're both dominant and have the majority but that will not always be the case. The worker placement aspect consists of about twelve different actions that affect the board state: as all placements are made before any actions resolve there is a lot of ambiguity about what the board state will be when you get to resolve your actions. This gives the game a very thematic feel of adaptability and flexibility. This is often perceived as chaotic, but I think that's overstated; there is definitely room for planning. Although, someone with AP and who has to be in control, will have a really bad time as the gameplay isn't really suited to their play style.
The game can be very cutthroath, there is an abundunce of both indirect and direct interaction. Especially the card effects can be brutal, to a point where some players are no longer in contention, although there is no player elimination.
The rulebook is one of the best I've ever come across. While not the most rules-heavy game, it's certainly a deep game with a lot of moving parts. The rules are very clear and consise which is quite the feat. A single read-through was enough to get started and we barely had to reference them whilst playing.
The components are wonderful and truly functional. I think it's great how the information that the game board has to convey is always clear, no matter how complex the board state. The 3rd edition might look a bit better, but I think will not be as clear whilst playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Really interesting area-control game, so much so that my buddy said it was three-dimensional.  The interplay among elements and area control with the animals is interesting as is the cascading effects of the actions, but I don't know if the cards cause too much randomness.  I played this with 6 and it dragged; I would like to play this again at some point with just 3  or 4 to see if it would be better, but I don't know if I'll ever get the opportunity.

UPDATE: Finally got to play this again... I think that 4 is where it really shines, and unfortunately I've now played it with 5 and 3. Still, over the full game, the cards are not random, the cascading of the actions is brillant, and the game is just solid. Also, a game with 6 is a little slow and more chaotic, but still fun once you know what you are doing.

Revised rating from 8 (2010) to 9 (2011) to 10 (2013).

Yup, this game certainly has continued to live long and prosper in my gaming circles. It is a deep thinking game with many tough decisions to be made along the way. I continue to thoroughly enjoy it after all this time.

New players will often feel miserable as they appear to lose but there are always outs and ways to claw back in and even move into pole position. Definitely not a game to judge on a first play basis.

----------------------------------------

This game has only gotten better with more plays. I enjoy the deep strategy and the heart wrenching decisions. The mechanics marry well with the theme. Prospective buyers/players should be warned that this is a long game, and it is a cruel one.

I can't believe how well CJ managed to incorporate a really vivid theme into what amounts to a cube-pushing worker placement game. You really do feel like you're fleeing from a glacier as you play this. I get right into it and even start naming my cubes. And I hate cubes! So amazing.

Love the theme of the game!

Interesting area control with a worker placement mechanic.  It's like a war game gone euro, except instead of attacks being the main answer (which it may be), usually depriving someone of their food source while beefing up yours in a specific hex is a more effective strategy.

1 play, 2er, 2 animals each.

Wow! I FINALLY got to play this, and it is pure awesome! Looking forward to trying it in other configurations:
- 2er, 1 animal each (2 each worked, but it's hard! I'm glad we didn't try 3 animals each!)
- 3er, 1 and 2 animals each
- 4er
I doubt, though, that I'll want to play it with 5 or 6 any time soon -- seems like that would last too long and have too much time between turns to be as much fun!

This is a deep worker placement (action selection), area control game with an evolutionary theme and a bunch of very tightly integrated mechanisms. It's sort of like Die Macher: long play time, a LOT going on at the same time, and all that stuff interacts with everything else in interesting ways that actually make sense!

Players represent families of animals, and each starts the game with the same number of cubes -- each cube representing a different species -- in a "gene pool", really the potential for your type of animal. Your goal is to have been the most dominant family of animal (not species) prior to the end of the world (the Ice Age). It's as if we, the dominant survivors of the Ice Age, are looking back to see what was most important prior to the Ice Age. Importance is, of course, measured by victory points (VP). You earn VP, from the start of the world (game) through the Ice Age, by having more species in more important landscapes. There's also a nice reward, slow to earn but steady, for being able to adapt to the ice itself. At the end of the Ice Age, every terrain scores (thematically, I guess, we the survivors are looking back at all of history) but prior to that, only specific terrain hexes chosen by the players will score (thematically: umm ... yeah, I can't come up with a thematic justification for this one!).

From a mechanism viewpoint:
- Players are unique animals, adapted to different environments. The game has 6 elements (represented by discs for sun, water, grub, meat, grass, seed) which are placed on the corners of terrain hexes, defining the environment in that terrain. Animals start with different mixes of elements to which they are adapted, and can further adapt during the game.
- Each player has a number of cylinders (AP's) used to select actions
- The actions are chosen first, in any order of the players' choosing, but resolve in order on the board -- top to bottom, left to right
- Actions do a variety of things such as: gain adaptation, modify the environment (add element to a hex corner on the board), place species (cubes) on the board, move cubes, kill other players' cubes, score a hex, advance the ice (place tundra), etc.
- Players compete in each hex in 2 ways: 
... Presence: based on the number of species (cubes); earn VP according to rank and area type
... Dominance: based on how well you're adapted to that environment (match elements on the hex with those to which you are adapted); leader chooses and plays a Dominance Card, which can have huge impacts on the game
- The evolutionary theme is represented (quite well!) by the constantly changing environment; the ability of animals to adapt over time; the rise, movement and fall of populations over time; and the constant advance of tundra as the Ice Age approaches

Very Good Game. Lots of meaty rules - several layers in fact. However, the rules are very well flushed out and all work well together. The mechanics are balanced, and the outcome of the player choices have very interesting re-percussive results that reverberate across the board. Very well thought out & fun.

RATING: 5
This is a very good, very well-designed game.  The worker placement, area control, and other mechanics all fit together nicely and it makes for a very deep and interesting strategic experience.  For me though the game is just missing that spark that makes it fun for me.

Perhaps it is the themeless coating the game has.  Placing different wooden shapes hardly feels like maneuvering an animal species to thrive and survive (this certainly does make it feel more like an abstract strategy game, something I'm not typically a fan of).  Perhaps it is that even if it were more thematic it isn't very interesting of a theme (to me).  Perhaps it's that all the games feel very same-y without much diversity in the actions and game events except for the domination cards.  Or perhaps it is that the domination cards themselves aren't very interesting and feel a little too easy to use when they are the most interesting and impactful elements of the game.

More than likely it is a combination of all of the above.  It is just such a well-made game that I can't hate on it too much, but not going to be one I'm that excited about playing.

Quite a good game, and lots of stuff going on here. Not at all complex in terms of play, only in terms of the  number of options. Still think it runs a bit too long, but with the right group, this is a very pleasant way to spend some time.

Edit: Again, on about our fifth play, I just can't get over that the game still seems just a bit too long. There may, in fact, be too much going on, which may add to the feel of the length of the game. Don't how to explain it otherwise. I want this to work with our group, but I just don't know.

RATING: N/A
Not my kind of game. I like the theme which I think is well integrated but the gameplay is at least a big clumsy sort of random events. Catching everything that's happening on the board is an exercise as its own. What a mess! Too much small things to get and the species versus animals with the matching elements and all it's just too much for me.

The game has an important learning curve of course but the way the elements are drawn, the way players compete with you and mainly the crazy events that can occur at some level, make me not wanting to learn more than what I know for now. Because I have the feeling that even though I can play better in the next time I play I may also make an even worse result!

Also on the dark side is the price of the game! Wow!

I think this might be the best 'gamer's game' since Le Havre.  I absolutely loved it; there are so many layers to this game and so many areas that knit  together seamlessly. The rules, for 20 pages, are quite straightforward, the way to play is not. There seems to be the perfect blend of strategy and tactics as neither can be ignored and putting one above the other punishes a player. The first game was one of complete joy as interactions between the action choices revealed themselves.

I'd be delighted is anything at Essen 10 is as good as this let alone better.

Props to wargame designer Chad Jensen - its as if a Classical musician had decided to make a rock album and it was the best of the year. Trad and boring Euro designers beware - this is the new standard

I have been eagerly awaiting this game for a while now.  As an enthusiast in evolution this game had obvious appeal.  

Let me say just a few words about it.  It is easier to pick up, learn and teach than you would think, but it can be overwhelming and daunting in the choices available and the repercussions of those actions.  The choices are savory, delicious, and frustrating all at the same time.  The placement of each action pawn can leave your palms sweating and you second guessing.  But is it is also engaging, enlightening, and immersive.  I look forward to many future plays.

And now for a rant:  Many have said the theme is "pasted on" I wholly disagree.  Sure, if you change the terms it could have been about colonizing Mars; but the theme fits, the idea of adapting regressing, colonizing, and competing all work together.  Because the game is you being an animal, it may be said that actions like abundance and depletion don’t really fit as those are just manipulating the board and have little to do with actions that animals actually do.  However, animals DO change their environment, and not just by accident.  Animals have forever adjusted their environment to suit their needs.  Humans are the best example, (if you are cold; build a house, you want food plant a garden), but many other species do that same thing to a lesser extent.  Birds eat berries and as the seeds pass through the birds, the seeds not only get dispersed, they get dropped in a nice little pile of fertilizer, increasing the amount of that type of berry in existence.    Beavers dam rivers, massively changing ecosystems to better suit them. There are thousands of similar instances where animals alter the environment.

This game seems very daunting, but is actually beautifully balanced and streamlines once you understand what you are doing.  In a game that has so many variables for scoring, it was incredible for me to see that in the last game I played,  there were three players and in the penultimate turn, all three players were tied at 99 points.  That to me really speaks to incredible game balance.

Very interesting game, which would even be good if it were either (a) less chaotic or (b) much shorter (but preferably both).

The combination of chaos and a playing time of 3-4 hours is an absolute no-no in my book. Fortunately, the game itself was good enough to provide enough compensation. But really, this would have benefitted from some professional German-style editing.

Wouldn't mind playing again, but probably not more than once a year.

Really enjoyable worker placement/area control game that actually fits the theme in a really subtle way, as players, much like the creatures presented within the game, have to constantly adapt to a changing game board, whether that's the terrain present, elements available, or species distribution.  My only complaints (after an initial play) is the length of the game and the swinginess caused by the Dominance cards.  There might also be a bit of a kingmaker aspect to it, mostly through the "competition" action, but I'll have to play more to confirm.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Who knew? It turns out that all you need to do to make a light area majority game I really like is to make it a small component of a heavy worker placement engine. :D

I do have some serious reservations, so let's get those over with first: most importantly, while I've grown to appreciate the typeface on the cover even though it looks like it was ripped from the opening titles of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was that really Comic Sans on the player aids? For shame.

There are issues with the design that less vicious players might care about, but things like potential player elimination and the "bash the leader" problem shouldn't trouble the target audience.

The only real problem is that the random effects are so significant, and even that is only a problem because the game is so long. It's particularly pronounced with the Dominance cards, which are very unbalanced, and reward the player(s) lucky enough to have the correct turn order position to take advantage. But it is also true of the other game elements: the luck of the element draw has a significant impact.

I'm having trouble articulating this right, but I want to stress that I think appreciating the strategy in this game means adopting more of a wargamer's mindset -- because the designer, Chad Jensen, has a background in wargames. They rarely involve perfect information and almost always include random elements, so "strategy" is more than just increasing the ply depth on your tactical minimax. Strategy is about creating situations with favourable probabilities -- and part of the fun is in dealing with unexpected windfalls and unexpected disasters.

The thing is, it's just tremendously fun, and feels much lighter to me than it actually is -- in part, I think, because it's not just calculating how much money you will need for your action in eight turns time. It's very fluid and your strategy has to be the same. 

At three hours, is it worth it? I think so, because it felt like half that time.

An interesting area-majority sort of game that gets a bit bogged down in its own mechanisms.  I think that having my first game be 6-player kind of skews my view of the game, but while I like the combination of Caylus-esque worker placement with a sort of El Grande type of area majority, the constant need to recalculate who is dominant, and the poor choice in vocabulary (dominant vs. dominance, the choice of the word "species" to mean a single cube, which is awfully counter-intuitive) cause some problems that bog the game down.  Games have to be [b]awfully[/b] interesting and strong to keep me engaged for 3+ hours, and I wasn't feeling that here.  I think with the correct group of people and a smaller size--4 seems about right for this--I could enjoy DS, but I don't really feel the need to try it again.

At first this game seems to be chaotic, but after dozens of plays it intricacy reveals a masterpiece. I have played this game about 50 times with the same two other players. This is the first board game I can say brings me back to the focus and planning I needed in chess. I found myself thinking 10 moves ahead and planning counters for every move my two opponents could make. Its like a 3 player chess game for us. Many of our games end with the point spread extremely close. Many people in my gaming circle could not handle all that was going on, it was too much for them. Others felt the game was too confrontational. I recommend finding players who can think ahead multiples moves, are extremely strategic, and can take a hit and come right back. If you find players like that you will have battles of wit that can rarely be achieved in other games.

I wish I liked this game better.  I love the concept and the mechanics are well thought out.  What I don't like is the huge downtime between turns, and the game is way too long for what it is.  Part of my problem may have been the number of players; we had six, at least half of them the type to analyze every possible outcome before making their move.  This may be better with fewer players and/or more familiarity with the rules.

RATING: 7.5
Very heavy and in-depth hybridization of a Euro and War game. There are so many factors and variables to consider that it is almost impossible to determine the best viable move in any situation -- something a lot of players complained about -- but I find that as a strength of the game.

The only major problem I have with the game, besides the heavy weight of the game, is some of the Dominance Cards.

Some cards are horribly imbalanced compared to others, and if you're in a good Dominance position when they come up it can really turn the game into a run away leader. Additionally, there is a problem with the whole "King Maker" problem -- one player can really give another player a huge lead -- especially if not all the players are on the same skill level.

I suggest some house variant that gives bonus VP for taking a subpar card, like between 2 and 4 VP to make the choice more interesting (similar to how the game rewards conflict by giving bonus VP for placing tiles near other tiles).

Despite its flaws, the game is very good and fills a very unique and different niche. A must play for any Euro fan who enjoys conflict!

EDIT: I decreased my rating from a 7.75 to a 7.5 because of the sheer analysis paralysis that can occur. If you get slow players the game to crawl to a stand still. Plus, the game feels a little too abstract for my changing tastes. Still a great game though!

Brilliant area-control/worker-placement game. The theme, which has you controlling a specific class of animal such as mammals, birds, reptiles etc, in an attempt to attain dominance across a variety of habitats is exceptionally well done. It feels a bit like playing a wargame although you have to consider elements such as having to be able to feed your species in order to 'migrate' and then 'dominate' a particular habitat and this ensures that the game also feels truly original. Each class of animal has their own unique skill, which means that players will adopt different strategies and will play quite differently depending on who they control. There are so many options to choose from on each turn and this means that a great deal of thought has to go into planning your moves but the gameplay is also simple and easy to understand. The result of this is that 'Dominant Species' is one of the deepest, strategic and most original games ever created. I can't fault it.

It's an animals' struggle in the ice age, modelled using board game rules. The final effect is extremely interesting: we can say it's a euro (very well written simple rules), but with some strong negative interaction and variable player powers (animal special abilities). I'm really amazed how the phenomena and evolution mechanisms were put into the game actions: the animals can reproduce, adapt to new kinds of food, migrate and fight with each other. Moreover, the environment is also changing: new areas are being discovered by animals, food is (dis)appearing and finally the ice is coming...
At the same time, it is a very meaty game for real gamers. It's mainly tactical, as the players should adapt and change their plans according to the situation on the board that is constantly changing. Still, some general strategy is also appreciated, especially taking into account the animal special abilities, the order of crucial special cards, tundra occupancy and possibility of acquiring final points. The game cons are: (a) it is AP prone, (b) it's really long (4-5 hours) (c) with 6 players you'll probably have too little influence on the game (similarly like in Imperial 2030) and (d) there is a significant random factor as the elements (food) are appearing randomly. However, the weaknesses fade comparing with the game taste. An outstanding design.

Probably one of, if not, my favourite game. It's a brain burner, and mentally exhausting, but extremely satisfying. Very deep strategy with an awesome theme and surprisingly smooth gameplay. The rulebook is very clear and well-laid out. The only downside is that it's too long for my game group so we don't get it to the table as often as I'd like.

Fantastic but flawed. I put it in my top 10 but it would be top 5 were it not for the constant mental arithmetic to determine dominance, which gets worse as the game goes on. It's not difficult but it's unrelenting, and adds a lot of time that could be better spent playing.

Clearly there is audience for this game. I played in a game with six players, if the game can not handle six players then it should not include that on the box. Exaggeration like that will only lead to 6 people walking away from a table thinking your game is bad.

lacks the solid narrative of an american 4+ hour wargame, but it also lacked the snappy thought/reward cycle  appreciate in euro games.

First impression... very good!
Usually I try to catch something from past games to define a new one, and this for me is "similar" to Primordial Soup and Caylus. With "similar" I mean that could you recall it, anyway is a different game.
A solid german game from the USA, with a tons of things to look at.
Played three times in 6 players and one in 5, it gives you a lot of tension trying to catch the best way to maximize your score and reducing the opponents, but often the high interaction change a lot of thing during the turns.
I have to try it in four players to understand if it works better with lower interaction.

I have mixed feelings about this.  It is very nicely produced, with an interesting mix of components.  It is a very clever design, and gets in a lot of science in a mostly painless way.  It is an engaging multiplayer game.  However, it is extremely fiddly, with a lot of un-engaged downtime.  It feels like an ambitious undertaking that wasn't...quite...completed.

All that said, I probably would not buy it, but I would probably play it again.

RATING: 4.5
If migration wasn't part of the game, this would probably be 0.5 higher. It makes sense and is probably necessary, but just adds an hour to the game which IMO just isn't needed.

Update: The time this game takes vs. the pleasure I derive from it has destroyed my rating for this game. TBF, it's probably not a bad game, just completely not my type of thing.

For a 4 hour game, there is far too much chaos and unpredictability, making it basically impossible to plan more than a few minutes ahead. It is also far too easy to have one player (or more) all but wiped out with no chance of winning and still having three hours to go.

In summary, it is a clever game (though heavily influenced by Age of Empires), but just completely not my kind of thing.

RATING: 9
I really really enjoyed this game.  Even if it is quite long.  At this time, I see no reason not to shorten the game a tad bit by removing a few cards.  Perhaps that changes the balance a bit, but it doesn't seem to matter at this time.

Still, I think that this one is definitely worth the time and effort.  With different numbers of people, I'd almost rather play other games, but I think this one might scale fairly well.

Reminds me heavily of Age of Empires III, with the 'action placement' mechanic.  Since I already own AoE3, I can't picture picking this one up.

That aside, it's an enjoyable game. I think it's a little more fun that AoE3, but at the same time, it feels more obtuse.  It's not terribly clear what the best strategy is.  I played the Insects in the one game of this that I've played, and ended up in 2nd place. (Or as Hunter J. refers to it: 1st loser.  Heh.)

The production quality is fairly high, at least by GMT standards.  I was surprised by the mounted board, but visually the game still looks a little bland.

RATING: 9
You see the cover and think Evo, but for gamers. You see the board and think El Grande. But Dominant Species is neither Evo than El Grande.

In this game you have 2 levels of area control and worker placement. One level is the same like in all area control games - you have the most cubes on a tile, so you will score the most points. But the`re also the dominantion. Every animal needs some food. There`re several food tokens adjecent to a tile of a board. You multiple the number of this tiles with the number of the food tile of your animal. The animal who has the most point dominate on this tile. You need only one cube, to have domination. 

When a tile is scored (when a player goes to an action field domination), the player with the most cubes scores the most points, than the second etc. The player who has domination scores no aditional points, but takes a card. The cards are very strong (but not too strong), and can change much. Soyou have to decide, is it good for you, to score a field, where you become much points, but another player a card.

In every game every card comes into play. You see the cards, that can influence the game in this round, so you have time to minimalize their bad effect, when another player will take them, or decide, to catch the card. 

To place a tundra tile is another powerfull action. The tile loses his funcion and is now a tundra. In tundra you have not much food, and can earn not many points, but someone who have the most cubes in a tundra will score (the more points, there more cubes on diferent tundra tiles).

Each animal has a diferent ability. When there is a tie, the food change shows who will be better. The better your ability, the lower you are in the food change. But i don`t like the food change.

The`re different ways to score - put a tundra tile on the board, put a new tile on the board, score a tile where you you have majority (on the most tiles not only one player will score), the most cubes on all tundra tiles.

The game is very long, but you have many choices. The domination really changes the standard area control. It`s not two area control in one game, it`s two levels of area control in one game. Great game, want to play more!

EDIT: Great game, my rating would be 10, but the games is too long. 1st 3 players game (easy mode - 1 animal/player) - 4,5h, 2nd game (easy mode, for 2 of 3 players played for the 2nd time) - 6h.

I want to LOVE this game. It looks great and the theme is right up my alley. Everything is as it should be - except:

COMPLEXITY thy name is death - or should that be the other way round... :)

We have played it twice with 2 players. It is chaotic to say the least. You try to plan ahead. You try to see what possible advantages you could gain. You try to mitigate those as best you can.

Yet, often it feels like I am being played. You can predict to a certain degree what the other will do, but there are so many different variables that you cannot see them all and I just feel lost.

I want to feel in control. I want to feel like the master plan I have is working because of what I do - not because someone missed a step - or because it all fell down around you, because you could not oversee everything.

Is the game at fault because I cannot comprehend it? Or because I have expectations it cannot live up to? Perhaps not, but that said, if the game removed a few levels of complexity - like the dominance cards - perhaps it would all be easier.

Well, I am not going to tinker with it... on the trade pile it goes. :)

Played once at 5P and once at 4P. Too many options to evaluate at a reasonable pace without practice; even players of several games can take quite a long time to place or execute an action. Thematically: not much evolving; unthematic direct, specific interaction; and too much terraforming. Initiative is far too strong. The initiative leader only really needs to worry about his closest competition, while the player at the bottom needs to worry about everyone; this makes things simpler for the person in the easy position, and harder for the person in the hard position.

A bit fiddly, and while the cones are a pleasing shape abstractly, they are difficult to handle and have no redeeming value (for instance, helices would be thematic). They get easier to handle as they get older (and dirtier?)

Enthralling!  Really love the thematic treatment.  But game length is a bit of a bummer.  Also, it has a slightly wonky midgame during which it sometimes doesn't pay to play optimally, i.e., the tallest flower is the one that gets snipped.  For now, the meta-strategizing feels slightly out-of-theme to me. Or is it? I can't decide.  This rating is in flux and may settle +/- a point in the future.

Great look/style to the game. I do enjoy it but I do think the game has some issues.  I dislike the constant counting for dominance, also, it is pretty long with a good chunk of randomness.

Slightly long, but super engaging. Really an interesting playing experience. The sides are asymmetrical enough to make a unique experience for the player while not being so radically different that the player has to understand that animal's strategies. The bonus points and cards make this a game of position and timing.

I think I prefer the game without the 4 cards that affect the action pawns. It speeds up the game and keeps that imbalance out.

Wow. This is, hands down, my favorite board game ever! It is certainly a LONG game which can make it hard to get to the table. The rules are relatively straightforward but combine in a really cool way to create an interesting dynamic system on the board that makes this a real brain burner. I love the kind of thinking this game requires. However, this can lead to quite a bit of AP with some players. This does not bother me, however, since I am constantly engaged with the game trying to plan my strategy (or at least my next moves) even when it isn't my turn.

Reduced down from 8, since I feel the length deters this game from being played more often.  Would like to try playing it next time with a smaller number of cards, to see if that helps.  A shorter, more intense game, would be more enjoyable.  Too much downtime, due to mechanics of the game.

Although I generally enjoy this type of game in which everyone is fighting for survival and expansion in tight quarters, there were a couple of things that made this game slightly suboptimal to me.  Mainly the bookkeeping of keeping the Dominance markers correct is annoying at best, and completely disrupting at times.  They can change hands with almost every little change on the board.  Nevertheless, the worker placement along with conflict and area control will definitely appeal to many.

Wow, I have been wanting to play this for yonks, bu slightly put off by it's length. However when I did play it, those 5 hours (4 newbies) went very quickly, as althugh it's a big game, it is not prone to AP except for the most ardent of sufferers!
Some very nice mechanisms that have that good feeling of "aargh I wish I had just one more action", coupled no unaway leader syndrome as the game can flip in a couple of turns with th eright play, and because there is varied scoring that can really ramp up in the 2nd half of the game. Overall a delight, and one to purchase as I can see this coimng out 2 or 3 times a year.

RATING: 5
On the plus side, players have a ton of options for each action, which is nice. On the negative side of the ledger, the game is pure tactics, with the board and situations changing so frequently that long-term strategy is difficult if not impossible. The real downside here is game length. Three hours is probably optimistic in terms of game length, and while this is a solid worker-placement and area-control game there's just nothing that's innovative or interesting enough to justify that kind of time investment. The theme is paper-thin, which left me feeling like I was playing an abstract game for endless hours rather than building a world and guiding a species in its quest for survival. I was a bit bored and ready for the game to end about an hour before it did (despite playing a strong final two turns and locking up the win). Dominant Species is not awful, but I'm puzzled by all the praise and high ratings ...

Take El Grande, add a bunch of new game mechanics, and put 4-5 times as many regions on the board. That's Dominant Species. 

The game sucks because it has lots of down time. The game board changes frequently, so it's difficult to form a long-term strategy. As a result, players will AP (analysis paralysis) as they adapt their plans to changes on the board. Because the game is so overloaded with game mechanics, there are long waits between turns. 

Because you have to adapt your strategy at every turn, the game is more about reacting than planning. So not only are there long waits, but there is little to think about during the down time. There aren't any battles, or anything that would make the wait more interesting. 

This is what happens when game designers overload a game with game mechanics. Don't buy this game. It is tedious.

I've played a 4 player game and half a 2 player game with my wife.  The 4 player game was fun, but we picked up all the extra Action Pawn cards on the first turn which made the game last very long. This game is not for the feint of heart.  You WILL be combative with your fellow players, and you need to take i with a grain of salt.  My wife liked it okay, but I don't know that she would ever play it again.  When I play it again I will play it with fewer cards, to speed the game length up.

Played with fewer cards, which did speed it up considerably.  We removed all the extra Action Pawn cards (3) and two other cards, resulting in a game that is at least 1, and possibly two turns shorter.  Also fewer Action Pawns leads to shorter turns on top of that.  Might make it to the table more due to this.

This is a great game that I'd like to get some more experience with.  It might be the mind-meltingest game I've ever played.  The consequences of decisions can be profound and unpredictable, especially with a high player count.  And the game can be extremely unforgiving to mistakes.

Both the worker placement and area control aspects are expertly designed.

My biggest complaint is related to constantly re-assessing dominance, which can be difficult to do without frequent "I have 2 + 2 + 1 to your 2 + 1 + 1 and he has 2 + ..." conversations.  So that's a bit awkward and can be an easy source for honest mistakes.

The asymmetrical sides seem well balanced.  The differentiation between animals, though fitting, could have perhaps been pushed a little bit further to better accentuate the theme.  Playing as insects isn't really that appreciably different than playing as mammals, for example.  Then again, greater differentiation could mess up the balance, so maybe I shouldn't look at this gift horse in the mouth too closely.

RATING: 8
Preliminary rating. High player interaction, prone to AP, which effectively isn't that bad since lots of mechanics are intertwined and actions taken(especially those of your opponents) do affect your play vastly more than they do in tons of other games. 

I think this game ranks high on a tactical scale. Sure, regression, wasteland and depletion are things than can be be planned ahead but overall I think to pursue a long-term-strategy won't get you far or as far as short-term tactical decisions adapting to specific game situations will get you.

Highly confrontational direct competition with a variety of actions for creating and maintaining numerical superiority on the board. Multiple ways to score points mean there are important decisions to make every time you take a turn.

RATING: 9
Agricola introduces additional tension to the worker placement genre by letting you slowly starve to death unless you take measures to prevent this. Dominant Species introduces additional tension to the worker placement genre by allowing you to tear each others throats out. 

Trying to build a planet, adapt your class of animals to that planet and put them in a position to score points is a lot to juggle when fighting over actions. Add in direct combats, the swing of the cards, losing ground both in the form of regression and wasteland and you've got quite a puzzle. Oh yeah, and there's the entire glaciation sub-game which doubles as both a devastating, if slow moving, weapon of mass destruction and a clever way to introduce a second major source of points. 

This game is intense, due to the length, the depth and the level of aggression. That is why you will love it. It's why I do.

Edit: This gets a ten from me.  I just adore everything about this game and wish I could play it more.  It is not a game that is gentle to one's brain, as you're 100% on for the entire multi-hour length.  But oh, what a ride.  And also, best rulebook ever, possibly.

I really enjoyed this game a lot but for some reason my gaming group hated it. Maybe it was the instructions but it rubbed them the wrong way. Granted we only played once but I would really like to get it back to the table if I could manage to bribe my friends. I think it will have a high ranking but it's difficult based on that one experience.

Now, don't get me wrong, the mechanics to this game are pretty sound and straight forward (as much as a 5 hour game can be), but I think it's more an exercise in diplomacy over strategy.  Especially during the end-game, I really felt like there was nothing to do but give the seemingly 1st place player the middle finger since I was so trampled and weak.

Andy explained it pretty well when we started by saying that the board changes so much per round that it's hard to have a strategy that lasts for more than two turns at most.  Plus, there are spite cards to acquire and players can gang up pretty easily on another player.  

But, the worst thing about this game is that I feel it's relegated to "heavy gamers" alone.  I had fun, but the arguing in-game left a sour taste in my mouth.  I really can't imagine how a game can be completed without at least one shouting match going down.

This game is brilliant, but completely brutal. I don't think I could play it more than once a month or so. Finishing a game of this, all I am capable of is sitting on the couch and staring off into space for a little while.

I'm not sure whether or not I really enjoy the "each player takes two animals" variant for three players. I'd like to try this game with four.

EDIT: Yup, better with four. Now I'm mostly concerned about the swinginess of the endgame.

I LOVE this game. It's everything that makes a game great for me. I can't wait to own the second printing with the thicker tiles.

I now own the second printing with the thicker tiles. In all honesty, there is very minimal difference between the two versions. So if you can get the first printing for cheaper, go for it.

Even though I only have a few games under my belt, this game is getting better and better with each play. I'm starting to wrap my head around the complexity of the whole system and I'm loving the way a small change from a seemingly insignificant action can result in large-scale, game-changing affects. 

The game is looooong. But I've had no problem removing certain cards that lengthen the game (i.e., all cards that add APs) and it still comes out nicely. If the game played a bit more quickly, and if it wasn't such a beast to teach, it would be a 10. For now it will sit at a 9.

It's just so dang hard to get to the table that for lack of its replayability, I'm lowering its rating to an 8.

02-2013 The second experience was smoother and a relatively brisk 3 hours, but I can't say I'm going to adjust my rating. On the surface this seems to be a well designed game, where the many mechanics match the theme, but the amount of chaos, really just makes this a game of hot potato, where you beat each other up and just hope you have the high score when the bell rings.

I would agree with the house rules that removes the cards that grant extra action pawns.

06-2012 Wow, what a disappointment. This game is way too chaotic for how long it is. Or it's way too long for how chaotic it is.

Or whatever. Don't particularly want to play again.

RATING: 6.3
I've given this game maybe 4 or 5 plays, and while it's a fine game I'm not a huge fan. For starters, it plays a bit too long, even with 5 games experience under our belts our group struggled to finish a game in less than 2.5 hours, with the first plays dragging out to 4 hours or so. There are just too many opportunities to AP in this game, and so few of your decisions can be made until the previous decisions resolve. Turns really start to drag.
Second, for a euro game with very minimum theme (all cubes and cones here) this game is especially pvp oriented. Not only that though, but the pvp feels exceptionally mean spirited. Single actions can essentially take players out of the game (which generally leads to king making later in the game). I think the problem with the pvp in this game (and I'm not talking about the competition action) is that it takes so long to set things up that when someone goes after your elements, or glaciers your dense population center off the board it just feels horribly demoralizing. More than one play of this game ended with people having ruffled feathers by the end. 

The game is not so bad I wouldn't play it, but there are many other games I'd rather play for the same time commitment, like Eclipse, or Dungeon Lords.

I have read the comparisons to El Grande and I see that, but I compare this to San Marco, a game that I love.

I make the comparison because it has helped me to better figure out why I don't love DS. (Note:  I have played DS 3 times and SM over 20 times.)

Both games are area control and both have huge decision trees and both games have thin margins so that the scoring is very swingy.  

My main problem with DS is that the decision tree is so much larger than San Marco that it feels overwhelming.  

My second problem is that the play time for DS is 3 hours while SM clocks in at about an hour.  

Finally, the cut-the-pie mechanic in SM is more unique - and I find it be more fun - than the action drafting mechanic in DS.

So what I get with DS is a 3-hour, tactical brain-burner that feels like winning has as much to do with accidentally being in the right place at the right time.

What I get with SM is a 1-hour, tactical brain-burner that feels somewhat like winning has as much to do with accidentally being in the right place at the right time and has a very fun mechanic that I have seen in only one other game (Piece O' Cake).

I actually love DS's theme and the theme shines in the gameplay.  This is the chief reason that I am willing to give this another couple of plays.  I am actually going to try and play this one without the cards (just track whenever the "Domination" action is taken by flipping a card as a method for counting down game end and still doing the dominance bonuses of Ice Age).

I feel this may cut a half-an-hour off of the time and keep the swingy-ness of scoring from adding chaos to the game.

RATING: 8
This game didn't impress me as much as I thought it would. I found the theme (if you can call it that) almost entirely non existent. In fact, I struggle to map the actions with anything thematic at all. That cubes are supposed to represent individual species is just plain terrible design. They really should have pasted a different theme on it.

Mechanically the game is actually well designed. It is sufficiently complex to challenge deep strategy players with very little randomness. It can seem chaotic because of the effects of choices made by other players, but when the game is well understood most of this can be controlled to some extent and it is definately possible to establish strategic lines to carry through most of the game.

I wouldn't turn down a game of this, but I'd prefer to play a few others if given the choice.

My pick for top worker-placement game.

It's area control driven by the hot mechanic of the day. Vastly more enjoyable to me than another economic engine game.

It helps this is a fairly unique topic that's interesting, it is mechanically rock solid, has virtually limitless variation due to the draw of the elements/tiles/cards but remains at all times a perfect information game. The game will never screw you, and it will never hold your hand. You're rewarded for strong play and punished for foolish or weak plays.

Damned excellent and I want to play this more!

First Impression:

ULTRA heavy eurogame. The are many options and though they're manageable after you get used to them (unlike late game in Le Havre), they are all available from the start and that makes the game quite intimidating. The game is prone to analysis paralysis but I think it was designed this way - downtime is not an issue as you have A LOT to think about while your opponents play, and their moves force you to constantly adapt. 

The theme is very well intergrated (even though uninteresting imo) and the subtle species differences work well. Cards range from broken to average and their appearence order significantly diversifies games. Luck is not a factor, this is a classic euro. Interaction is on the extreme level, you never feel alone on the planet.

It's an open information game, but the information available is just too much for me. It's also too easy to lose track of something (f.e. dominance) and make a scoring mistake. Both of these "problems" are actually design decisions: This game is a dedicated heavy gamers game, and will appeal to those who like to exhaust themselves in one multihour (~3-4h) eurogame. For this category of gamers, this game is paradise and they will never lose track of anything or find any amount of information intimidating. The game also has strong "take that" and "kingmaking" elements that I never like in multiplayer games, but good players can plan to avoid them so it's not a gamebreaking element for most, just really bad for me. Finally, Dominant Species has both in game scoring and late game scoring which are roughly equally important, with the late game scoring however being almost impossible to calculate in game in normal play times. This creates the problem that whenever you have to bash someone (every round many times) you can't really know who is really leading, and even worse the game gives a false impression with the in game scoring which can easily guide your hand very wrongly.

I prefer eurogames that last up to two hours. I can enjoy a really good game if it lasts an hour more (say, 5p agricola or terra mystica), but really these are my eurolimits. If I'm to play ONE game for 3-4h hours, then it will be a wargame, preferably a global domination/diplomacy one. So Dominant Species is just too much for me.

This is unlikely to ever ascend to a spot among my very favorite games, but I do both appreciate the design and enjoy the gameplay. And I say this as someone who came to the game with a fair amount of trepidation -- not because of the length or complexity (I play enough 18xx and wargames that are at least a match for this), but because I often have problems with games that are tactical bash-the-leader affairs (El Grande being the poster child for games of this style that I strongly dislike). This, combined with mixed-to-negative opinions from others in my game group (which were though counterbalanced by rave reviews by others on BGG with similar tastes to mine), meant that it took a long time for me to even get this ame played. And I liked it. Didn't fall instantly in love as others have, but genuinely liked it. I'm not sure I can fully explain why the tactical nature and bash the leader mentality of this game didn't bother me as much as I thought they might (or as the same characteristics of other games do), but I will put forth a few thoughts. First, DS has an epic feel and strong story arc. This can't fully explain my positive reaction as I usually dislike and therefore avoid purely "experience"/narrative games, but it does help that the theme of DS comes through so strongly. Second, there are enough dimensions on which there is a leader (current score, dominance markers, board position for final majorities) that it is not always apparent who to bash -- or different players will have different incentives on who to bash depending on where and how they are competing. Third, there is just so much chaos anyway that leadership in general or on any tile in particular is very transitory.

The best game of 2010 hands down. This game has it all. Tight area control, worker placement tension...ahhhh you just need to give this game a try.

Tried this one exactly twice with 2 players. Once with each of us playing 2 animals and once with us each playing 1. Both were unsatisfying experiences. Both games had some elements go dead and drop off of the earth. Ugh this needs to be a 5 or 6 player game.

Heavy duty! This game has such strategic depth it hurts. Very well designed, as all of the actions blend together well and make a complex game simple to play. However, the strategy is anything but simple. There is a lot of player conflict in this one, as animals battle for supremacy. I really like the theme, the cards really help it come through. It hurts my head... but it's a good hurt.

Best game of 2010. The diversity of options and depth of game play cannot be found easily in other games. Some people may talk about chaos, but this is exactly the opposite of what this game offers. Another important feature that makes this game really interesting, is that players adapt to new strategies each time they play the game again. Not only you have to manage how your species adapt, but the player as well adapts his overall strategy and understanding of the game each time he will play this game again. Do not play with players of "analysis-paralysis". You will spend 4 intensive hours with 5 players! It is time well spend!

We played it tonight with three newbies and one who has played before – it went long but once we got the hang of it it's seemed to be pretty fun.

I don't think I would ever want to play with more than four and three would probably be a good number also – it has to be played with the right people or it won't be a very good slog.

Definitely not one I would pull out every night but I think it's a lot of fun and look forward to pulling it out again 

I rated it below a lot of others even though I may like it more because it is long to play – especially with new players – and it started to wear out his welcome. Next time we play I think it would go a lot better

I like the theme of the game. The actions are very thematic and add to the flavor of the game. This is a heavy Euro game that seemed to play well with fewer players. There are many issues to think about before making decision on the moves. This is suitable for one who enjoy more strategic gameplay instead of a more luck based game play.

The cards can have huge impact on the game and it is important that players always take note of the cards available. Some can have very devastating effect that can cripple a player badly if one is not careful.

RATING: 5
Is this game brilliant? Maybe. I don't know, and I frankly don't give a shit. Clearly you have to fight for turn order, but you can't keep first player for two turns in a row if others players are competent. the cards come out randomly, so you never know when a game changing card will come out. You spend 4 hours playing a game, and, at some point in the game a card will come out that blows up the whole map. Assuming you're competent, maybe you're in a position to take advantage of it or just survive it. Maybe you're not. If you're not competent, maybe you're in a position to take advantage of it or survive it. Maybe you're not. Sure the factions feel very different and require very different strategy. But it feels like the beautiful strategy was layered on top of mind-fucking chaos, instead of a bit of chaos being layered on top of beautiful strategy. I give it a 5, because I see why others might like it, but I didn't enjoy it. I don't need to invest my time into this madness.

Update June 2014. Bumped back to an 8. Such a crazy & unique game, and beautiful too. Somehow the thee & its crazy permutations save it from dull WP constraints. 

Update Jan 2013
My tastes have shifted toward less overhead related to programming churn & a growing worker placement distaste. I need another play from my new point of view to find out if the thinking is so much about the other players as it's about tracking what the game kicks at you. My reduction to a '7' is provisional, I'll re-evaluate with the next time it comes around for play.

Even if it remains a '7,' it is an expression of my personal gaming desires. The theme & design ambition remain very worthy, and if it's context appeals to you, it's an exceptional game.

- - - - -

Play ripples across the board, the butterfly effect. So you get screwed by butterflies repeatedly in this game. That can't be bad, right? They're pretty little things.
...

Strong recommendation to play without the cards associated with extra workers, a variant approved by the designer.

[b]On perceived chaos in some threads:[/b] My thought here is that the unpredictableness in this game is due to the way the game systems do not protect you from other players. And given that there are many choices in this game, it's challenge is managing three or more other player's many unexpected stunts & machinations.

The overturn of cards and elements is predictable... these things become static once they occur, and can be taken into account with your worker placement programming. But since you place all your action pawns first in turn order and then execute them all, you can't churn through all those iterations layered with some 20 human choices. It's those [i]people[/i] getting into your face.
...

Multi-layered area control, totally absorbing as the earth grows, elements differentiate the various environments (tiles), and your animal speciates, competes, ebbs, adapts, thrives again. Glaciation provides pressures to population, but is also something to be controlled and scored in multiple ways. The game state changes constantly, and it is a pleasure to plan each turn with your worker placement & then have so many tactical opportunities when you do execute your action. Especially with up to 5 others messing with your species & your environs.

Theme & mechanics are indivisible; in their efforts, both cooperative & aggressive, a "great chain of being" is in constant motion rather than a static built thing. The asymetrical "powers" for each animal and card effects aren't so much balanced as feeding a dynamic you must survive.

The rules & gameplay are exceptionally clear & the game runs smoothly. So the how to do things doesn't dominate, but there is a permutation cliff one can fall off.

The bits & board are very pleasing too. This game looks good on the table, but has just the right understatement to support ease of reading the board & doing things like scanning/calculating for dominance. 

Brain fart warning. Maintaining a strategy in such a dense, changing & opportunistic environ rewards tactical oppertunism with a bit of loose, sneaky strategy. The first couple of plays this will feel like permutation churn, or foggy, but it settles out with familiarity.

Brilliant game narrative.

This is a great game though, don't let my comments dissuade you, you need to play this! And I can't wait to get this back to the table.

Updated comment: Looking back, this game isn't that particularly heavy. The first play is definitely overwhelming, but each subsequent play becomes far simpler and easier. People have called this a war game disguised in Euro clothing and that's definitely the case. Playing face-to-face is the best way to play even though I quite enjoy the IOS app. 

This game ended up firing Caylus for me. The play is just a lot more tense. 

9/5/15 - Updated rating from a 8 to a 9.

4/6/17 - Updated rating from a 9 to a 8. Doesn't play well with 3 at all.

Solid game.  DO NOT PLAY WITH LESS THAN 4 PLAYERS.  There's a lot of "screw someone else" effects, which are only survivable if you're not the sole target of someone's wrath.

That said, it's one of my favorites, and given the choice, I'd play this much more often than I normally would.  It's only dropped in rating because of the inability to play with fewer than 4 players and the significant length of play.

Damn. This game is phenomenal. After one two-player game my mind is blown. Four tension-packed, engaging, brain burning hours passed in what seemed like 90 minutes. After I finished playing, I would have been willing to immediately play again. The design of this game is amazing, as everything fits together so well. I love games that let you plan out your moves in advance, but require flexibility as well. I am a huge fan of area control, as long as players can plan to defend against attacks and to conquer regions, as opposed to having to rely on luck. I love games with a combination of strategy, tactics, and tense decisions, and Dominant Species delivers. Outstanding game.

fun but stressful; you are constantly engaging in correct placement for maximum points/survival and in defense against the other players' placements;  working toward maximum points through area control to get most endgame points as well;  very hard to keep control of areas -- many factors can shift points at any given play;  this is a VERY competitive game scenario

Update 2017: After not playing for six years, I sold it. There was very little chance it got on my table ever again. Too bad though.

____________________

Second play, 5p.
Lots of chaos and and hefty dose of bad luck, combined with suboptimal makes for a looong sitting... I prefer 4p over 5p and won't try 6p.

[q="Tsaar"]Great game, great session. The scores were pretty close during the whole game, except for the two last rounds when James first got away with three Wanderlusts and a fistfull of bonuspoints, and Audrey who went on a killing spree in the last round which made up for some points she was lagging behind. The cards work in a way that reminds me of [thing=12333][/thing]. You know things are bound to happen and you know that they cannot be stopped, so you have to keep controlling the imminent damage but you can only win the game by taking some risks and expanding your species over the board.

A typical 'if I had done that' and 'I should have noticed' discussion was held afterwards, and if it weren't for the long time to play I would have liked to start a new game immediately.[/q]

RATING: 8
A largely abstract Euro game with the theme of surviving an Ice Age with a broad "class" of animals, such as birds, insects, or mammals. Gameplay is a mixture of worker placement to choose your action and area control to help your species become dominant. As you desperately search for new terrain to expand to, snowy tundra spreads over once verdant land.

2 plays.  Really enjoy this game  There's a lot to take in, and each action taken will have an effect on how most things after it happen, so you really have to pay attention to what everyone else is doing just as much as what you are doing.  The special species abilities make each player start out with a different approach going in and would seem to have a decent balance at first look.  The learning curve and time it takes to play could restrict its appeal depending on the group, and it could be prone to AP, but our group doesn't have that problem.  

My second play I didn't pay enough attention to what others could do to harm me and after being in fairly good position one turn, I was nearly removed from the board the next turn (late in the game).  It's still a fairly long game, but I think it's worth it.

Was my game of the year in 2011.  Several plays later the excitement has cooled off for me as the best strategy seems to be turtling and flying under all the other player's radar.

I would eventually update this ranking I'm sure as I get more play throughs of this game and actually start to get decent at it. It's a pretty hardcore worker placement game where every decision you make is extremely important. I love the theme which is actually incorporated pretty well into the mechanics and the components are quality as well. Definitely not a beginners game though and I'd recommend other more basic worker placement games to most of my friends. However, when I'm with some dedicated gamers I can see having a lot of fun with this one.

A true gem of a game! The variable powers of the different species are subtle, and there are immense amounts of strategy involved.

The game can get chaotic quite quickly, but managing the chaos will be the key to victory. Absolutely fantastic from start to finish!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
I'm definitely not sold after one play. However I can see how the game rewards multiple plays (simply going in from the start understanding how all the various mechanisms will interact would be a very large boon).

On the other hand, I don't like the fact that you're often at the mercy of collateral damage from other people's decisions. This is randomness just as much as rolling dice is (perhaps a skilled enough player could anticipate everyone's optimal plays...). Some of the cards are quite powerful (although having majority control and scoring points is really where the game is won, so I'm not sure this is a big deal).

It's also very long, which makes it difficult to get to the table.

Anyway, I really need to play it again in order to rate it (and that's unlikely to happen since I won't be buying it).

Edit: improved impression of the game after second play. The length is still a serious problem (would almost always play the shortened variant with 4 cards removed -- and perhaps with a timer device of some kind).

Edit: even more improved impression after two more games. The length is perfect with the short variant (4 dominance cards removed).

You can make a game come out from GMT, you can make it themed around competing for area, and you can make it take four hours, but if the main mechanics are area majority and worker placement, it's still a Euro that I don't have much interest in.  Because I'm a fan of GMT, I'm glad to see this game succeed, but it's too abstract and separated from the theme for me to get into it.

Played a 4p game, my first and the others had experience, in just under 3 hours with rules explanantion.   It can be done.  I can see the complaints about fiddleyness and could see some AP problems with certain players, but it was enjoyable.

Will play again.   We sped through the deck, or so it seemed to me, so the game might have gone quicker than normal.   I see some areas where I need to do more long term planning - a sign of a good game for me.  It also had my mind going as I went to bed, another good sign.

I don't even like worker placement that much, but this game shows that it can be a great mechanic when it's supporting other stuff. Not for everyone, as it can be hard to understand and causes AP with even the best of players. Still - try it out, it's well worth it!

El Grande for two... Love this. It's a modern version of one of the proper old euros: games where players played against each other instead of solving puzzles in the same room.

Not sure how I'll feel about it if Jon starts beating me though. I've slaughtered him (almost literally) both times we've played... Last time, he only managed to hang on because he knew the tundra-penguin rule and I didn't.

area control through worker placement with a neat theme. mostly area control, though. not at all what i thought it would be. all the fun that could have been had with this theme! also a lot of incremental push and pull. the feeling is reminiscent of twilight struggle and el grande (both play faster) but with different mechanics. ultimately, a very long game with 5 players, even if people take their turns relatively quickly. a game would have to be more tense, outside of small pushes and pulls, or have more interesting mechanics for me to want to play it for 4 hours. in the end, you didn't build an empire or a neat engine and your species didn't mutate or proliferate in an imaginative way outside of basic area control of the map. would have to be in a special mood to play this again, and definitely not on a work weekday.

 Dominant Species does everything that I like in games- a strong spatial element, an incredibly tense worker placement phase, heavy player interaction, shared development on a map that is constantly changing based on player decisions, asymmetrical powers, etc.

The two different area majority battles that occur simultaneously on the board is perhaps the standout mechanic here- it is a brilliant idea and works beautifully to create angst and brain burn. Dominant Species perfects many of the old paradigms of gamers games and adds some truly innovative ideas of its own to make it a unique and incredibly compelling experience.

RATING: 6
Man, is there a lot going on in this game each turn.  It's almost impossible to do everything you want to do on any given turn, and understanding how one action will affect a future one is critical in really getting the best out of the design.  Am I the right person for this sort of game?  It's hard to say.  I mean, I could look at all aspects of the game and figure out what I need to do at any given time, but it will take me a long time, at other players' expense.

The game has an area control aspect to it, and those types of games elude me to a large degree.  I feel at a disadvantage when playing these games, and while there are other things going on in DS, the bulk of the game lies in holding majority in areas.  The separation of majority and dominance is an interesting point of the game, but that just creates yet another thing to keep up with during the game!  I like the game, and I really respect the design.  But I have to wonder if it crosses the fun/work threshold with me.

Despite saying that, though, I'm interested in playing again.

I just love this game to bits. The depth is incredible and even the kingmaking aspect hasn't managed to put me off. With 11 games behind us, my group can nail this game in 3 hours flat, which is perfect timing, in my opinion.

Edit: After 23 plays, we have now pushed play time below 2 hours!

Edit 2: To avoid kingmaking, do not invite married (or otherwise) couples. One half of a couple is ok, both are not!

Edit 3: I realised that most of the people who dislike this game have played with a large number of players: 5 or 6. A few nights ago I played a 6-player game and it was awful! Total randomness. 2-player vanilla games are pure skill. 3-player is great and 4-player is acceptable. Warning! Avoid 5 or 6-player games because skill has very little to do with them!

Thank you Chad Jensen for this sparkling gem!

RATING: 8.5
A heavy game. The third edition is aesthetically better looking than the previous editions. Not sure if everybody would be into the theme and its abstract appearence may be off-putting to some. Have not played enough times as is very difficult to draft people into this game.

It sometimes boils down to negotiating your way with the other players. It's a game that is hard to plan anything concrete as the board conditions are ever-shifting, leading to a need to be highly tactical.  

Most of the people with short attention spans would end up annoying you by expecting you to do the house keeping for them. Be sure that you know how to score tiles during domination phase, as mistakenly misinterpreting the rules could result in a "broken" game. Factions are quite well balanced in my opinion. Not advised to play with people who frequently change their minds as is very difficult to roll back the turns. Only fun with 4 players and up, but be warned games can get very cut-throat.

Suggested to play without the cards that grant AP for a faster more intense game.

Based on two half games, both of which ended because people got fucked over and didn't want to play anymore. There are lots of easy ways to make mistakes, and the penalties are so devastating that they can knock you out of the game permanently. (and the game is LONG)

I also don't like how severe the interaction is. Being able to mildly mess with people's plans is good, but targeted glaciation can take beginners out of the game in a single move. This seems way too harsh.

Overall, with careful play players could avoid getting blown out by targeted glaciation while still doing efficient actions. This would probably result in a 6 hour game though, and if you try to play reasonably there's something you inevitably miss that fucks you.

Dominant Species is the best game I have played in years. Although many parts of it are very abstract in nature, the game does a tremendous job of creating an atmosphere of constant adaptation and struggle for survival. At times, just trying to move into a habitable set of tiles can get so competitive it feels like a knife fight in a phone booth. The Domination cards really intensify the effect, because being able to control them is often times more important than expanding your species or scoring. People will fight for them, intensely.

All of this drives the game to very competitive place. Feelings are going to get hurt, people are going to get angry. I have played with a number of different groups and I have seen it play out time and time again. You are actively driving other players to extinction and silly as it may be, you will take it personally when someone pops a volcanic eruption under your population center and instantly removes half of your species from the game. You don't get them back, so you WILL want revenge. It drives the game, so even if it makes the group uncomfortable at times, it is necessary in creating the game's undeniably intense experience. This is one of those titles that keeps you talking about a particular session for weeks after you actually played it. It's a hall of fame game, one that will stay in my collection even if I decide to someday get out of the hobby.

On this website, it suggests that the game will take up 2 hours to play; and they are not kidding.  If you love boardgames, playing with others, and have a passion for strategy, this is the game for you. 

Dominate Species may be comparable to Settlers of Catan or Risk, for players are bent on expansion and having certain resources available on territories.  

The thing that sets this game apart from the rest is that it does NOT have any dice rolling.  This allows players to be more serious when scheming, as the element of luck is minimized to cards (a selection that the players see, and so it is not a shot in the dark when thinking about them), and how other players are going to act/play.  So in this way, Dominate Species is like a chess or checkers type game, and both my friends and I found this to be rather refreshing.

The price tag on Dominate Species is a rather hefty one: I got it for 70$ from a store, and I am sure buying it online will not be any better with S&H.  So if you do not think that you can attend to a 2 hour+ game, you do not like strategy, or you are unlikely to have 2+ other people (though this game is really better with 4-6 players), then I would recommend either getting it used from someone, or not bothering to purchase it at all.  I personally thought it was a good buy, plan on playing it frequently, and thought it was worth the price.

In any case, I would recommend at least giving the game a try if given the chance.  This game is not for everyone, but in the realm of strategy games, Dominate Species has "dominated" my own like list!

The game has a lot of stuff going on. However, there is still a lot of powerful events that can happen due to chance or another player's whim -- the game is definitely not very nice. Also, I didn't feel like my cubes were really species -- they didn't have enough unique characteristics that differentiated them from others.

Mega worker placement with added area control. Agricola eat your heart out!

Trouble is there is lots of down time and the intentional and unintentional screwage can make the game feel very random.

I liked it, but it is very long and very procedural. It's hard to translate your planning actions directly into board/scoring implications. Part of that is just unfamiliarity, but part is also the chaos/unpredictability of opponent actions.

Anyway, worth playing, but have to set aside a chunk of time.  I'm not sure it adds all that much to El Grande (for instance) to justify the 3x time.

Harkens back to the AH days of Tyrano Ex.  A long but solid Euro game of area majority in a world being covered slowly by ice.  A good "decision management" game. I have to give this game my "gamer's game" of the year award.  There's enough going on and calculate to make your head hurt.  The final scoring can be huge and needs to factor into your strategy.  I've upped my rating to a 9 for this game.  I don't give it a 10 due to the length of time it takes to play, even with 4 players.  It's about one turn or 30 minutes too long for me and for what it is, but still an excellent game.  Maybe if the Ice Age card were shuffled into the last 10 cards or so might shorten the game as well as add variability to the end game planning.

RATING: 3.5
Life in Dominant Species is nasty, brutish, but far from short, it stretches on for what seems like 3.6 billion years. The poorly thought out drafting mechanism delivers stupidly unbalanced cards that will either obliterate someone or do something entirely meaningless. A lot of player interaction focuses on TAKE THAT / SCREW YOU mechanisms. Unfortunately this isn’t used to keep front runners in check because the environment you are competing in shifted and it no longer makes sense to do so at that particular moment.

Thematically this game fits very well, competition for survival along with drastic environmental changes mean you will likely go extinct due to some arbitrary misfortune. Too bad you can’t gracefully die off and play something else that packs more fun into it. (Play Evolution or Primordial Soup instead, you will still get eaten, suffer a catastrophe or starve to death but you'll have a lot more fun while doing so.)

I've only played this game once so far, but boy what a first play. The theme gripped me from the start, and the gameplay didn't disappoint. We played with 4 players, and it went something like 4.5 hours, but it remained engaging. I had heard some complaints about constantly having to recalculate dominance, but it seemed to become fairly intuitive to us pretty quickly. We had to look up a few rules here and there, but we had a great time, and I look forward to playing again.

This was a very kind gift from an Elf in Thrifty Secret Santa 2016.

This is the foursome love child of Die Macher/El Grande/Agricola/Primordial Soup.  You have the tight multiple interactions of Die Macher with the scoring and card selection of El Grande with the worker placement of Agricola with the evolution of Primordial Soup.  

The result is an absolute gem.  There are strategic aspects in the speciation/wanderlust/glaciation/adaption roles, combined with the tactical considerations of speciation/dominance/migration actions.  Add in assymmetric powers, which are always fun if properly, and you have a great game.

What a delightfully vicious game! This is one of the most amazing euros I've ever played (albeit it can be mentally exhausting). A few hours of ultra brain-burning decisions and constant rivalry between you and your opponents. Fantastic combination of worker placement, area control/majority and special card powers. It's thematic, deep, rewarding and extremely interactive. And despite its complexity it's one of the most elegant heavy games I've ever seen.  Too bad it takes so long to play (that's the only major drawback) - it will hit the table once every few months at best (unless you play using an offical short variant - it works really well)...  Still, I'm blown away. Outstanding game.

Amazing game.  It deserves the praise its getting.  Simple rules with many agonizing choices each turn as you decide where to place your action pawns and which dominance card to select and play.

This game is too long.  I would have liked it much more if it were about 2 hours shorter--at 3 hours.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
For the first two hours, I would have rated it a 9, for the next hour a 7, and by the end, the 5.5 I gave it.

It is a really well designed game, in that all of its mechanics work together very well.  But, two weaknesses for me that drop the rating significantly.  First, it's just too long.  Taking out 5-10 cards and shortening the game by a round or two would be a phenomenal addition (subtraction?) to the game.  Second, there is a bash the leader problem here at the same level as the original Vinci.  Since scoring is open (albeit not quite as transparent as Vinci), you can see who is winning and who you need to bash in order to win.  And, of course, it is the right strategy in this game to bash them.  But, having one player get bashed for the last 90 minutes of the game so that he doesn't win and someone else does isn't really all that much fun.  

There is one more weakness that didn't change the rating for me, but probably should - the graphic design/bits.  Come on GMT - can't you enter the 21st century in game design?  Make the game look really nice; print on higher quality card stock, make the bits bigger; etc.

Like Vinci turned into Smallworld, maybe Days of Wonder can redo this game with really nice art design, cool bits and hidden scoring.

A nice mix of different mechanics and direct competition. Provides a lot of things to consider and track and while the game might take some time it does not feel overly long to play (mostly because the players are busy thinking about their strategy most of the time). There is a danger of some AP setting in during the endgame.

RATING: 7.8
All in all, a very good game with the only problem that it is too long. Our first play lasted 4 hours. We really enjoyed it but if it had been just 3 hours it would have been a great game, a 9 !
It's a worker placement, nothing terribly new but everything is mixed up in a very deep, vast experience , with many things to take into account, many ways to win, many tricks to play, many really tough and interesting choices The animals are really well balanced, actions are strong but not too much, the game flows easily: it just flows for too much time and the last turns drag slowly toward the end. We actually had the third player who won at the last turn so there was also a lot of emotions till the end.
If i had time and energy i would play another time soon.

Material is adequate. nothing incredible. Unfortunately in the migration phase, when you can move little cubes around, it's hard to keep track of all the movements.
During the first play it is not easy to remember the difference between two similar actions (depletion and waste land, maybe, not sure).

[EDIT]: after second play, years after, i found it still very long, still good, but I have a lot of doubts about cards and Domination action. Maybe it's just lack of experience but Domination seems a forced move and i dont like forced moves in games with several paths to victory.

I love the theme of this game. However, it has two major aspects that make it unsuitable for my gaming purposes. For one thing, it is much too cutthroat and mean for my circle of friends.

If I ever do get to play it multiplayer, I suspect I will remove a number of the dominance cards, both to reduce the meanness and to cut the playing time.

Deep thinking strategy game for area control that is heavily confrontational. Many actions to choose by worker placement that can cause a chain of cause and effect. Up to six species fight extinction from glacial expansion using abundance, regression, speciation, adaptation, migration, wanderlust, dominance, and depletion. Seeds, grubs, sun, and other needs come and go on the terrain tile intersections. So many options to consider...brain hurt. Card drafts from dominance phase can create huge swings. I am blown away by the depth and the interaction of the game elements. The sequential and cascading progression of the action board is amazing.

Thematically sound and mechanically resolute, [i]Dominant Species[/i] is a schizophrenic arrangement of scoring opportunities that is capsized (and sunk) by overpowered card effects.

It's also long.  Like, really and truly long.  Not engaging. Not captivating. Just long. As in, "I'd like to use an Action Point to rewind time and choose another game" long.  Or, "I'm not having fun, but I guess I'll keep playing" long.

To shorten the game, my group uses a variant where 5 cards are randomly removed from the deck, but even with this "fix" DS still overstays its welcome by at least an hour.

I'd rather play any other (shorter) area control game than [i]Species[/i]: El Grande, Cave Troll, Kreta, whatever.  Area control games aren't my thing anyway, so I suppose the point is officially moot.

I don't like [i]Evo[/i], either, but I'd rather curl up inside [i]Evo[/i]'s box and play the game from inside than sit through [i]Dominant Species[/i] again.  If DS played in 75-90 minutes, I might give it another go.  But since it can't, I won't.

RATING: 8
The game is surprisingly easy to play from a mechanics standpoint, but is brain-melting in trying to decide what to do.  I like the interlocking cube majority versus best adapted ways of benefiting from a space.

Even though the game has a lot of possible choices, the overall game makes sense.  Migration does what you think it should, adaptation does what you think it should, etc.  That makes it much easier to handle the wide array of choices that you have compared to other games with a bunch of choices that are just a pile of arbitrary ways of gathering victory points.

The only caveat is that you can't play this with the AP-prone.  It becomes torturous.  The game tempts you to do a lot of calculation, but the play is dynamic enough that it won't succumb to sheer calculation.  You need to play more by the seat of your pants.  In that setting, it's wonderful.

Had to downgrade this game from a perfect 10 to a 9.5 after playing Birds for the first time. The birds' special ability makes perfect sense thematically (easier migration) but does nothing for you in the actual game unless the right food can be found on the board. Which is something you can't control all by yourself. Especially if you have to give up an AP each rond to use on migration. Edit; I've since read on several threads that some groups give the birds a free migration action. This seems to make perfect sense and I'll probably play it that way next time.

I like it a lot but its length is a bit old school (making it a rough time to play with folks spoiled on leaner meaner current games)  and yet to shorten the game isnt necessarily the answer either as the randomness of cards and elements needs some time to mitigate.

Great game. As good as Through the Ages. Not too complicated if someone teaches it to you. The artwork is quite nice and everything works together well in the game.

I would rate it a 9, except that it takes a long time. Except when an opponent is really dragging out a decision (especially when they are choosing where to place an Action Pawn! and I've already decided where to place mine), I don't feel the time dragging. Even so, the length prevents it from reaching the "always want to play" threshold of a 9 rating.

A pretty long game. Presentation is a bit weak, but very functional. Evidently, it is a cause of debate here on BGG. Don't think I'd like to play this with more than four. Just like Puerto Rico and Caylus, it straddles that line between simple and complex that I like to occupy. It's certainly not all there, though. Don't really like most of the Dominance cards. I think I might like it more if it were replaced with some sort of Caylus-like privilege chart (could easily be labeled Evolution or Mutation), allowing players to pick and choose small improvements for their animal class.

I'm not usually a big fan of hugely long games and complex mechanics, but this one is a lot of fun. You need a pretty hardcore group if you're going to find anyone to play it with, though. Definitely not girlfriend/parent/kid-friendly.

Some will also be bothered by the extent to which the game is likely to be decided in the last few turns due to some combination of kingmaking and/or tragic oversight. It's very easy to screw other players over entirely, and equally easy to miss a crucial detail amidst the myriad options available.

This is a beast of a game that has so much going on yet really isn't overly complicated once you get the hang of the steps and how everything plays out. That being said... you'll inevitably forget something along the way and get totally destroyed... or that might just be me.

For a game that I'm generally pretty horrible at, and given the amount of time it take to play, that combination would seem like (at face value) to set up for failure, however, it's quite the opposite as it is a game that I really enjoy.

I really like the player interaction, strategy, and asymmetry of the species. What I have found to date is that that I generally don't play to my species strengths or play too much in to what I perceive to be its strength that I leave myself vulnerable in other areas.

As a war game that masquerades as worker placement, it is hard to beat on many levels. Its main drawbacks are the amount of time that it takes to play a full game and the number of people required for it to truly shine.

As it currently stands, it's really hard to give this game an accurate rating because of the infrequency that I have played it and the inability to fully explore its potential. However, from what I have seen so far, it's a game in my collection that I will never mind bringing to the table regardless if that means a 3+ hour beat-down.

This is a cool area control game with a worker placement mechanism for determining actions. This game is hard, the board changes drastically from when you choose your actions to when you complete them and for someone who doesn't play very often, it can be quite frustrating. That being said I enjoy the cut-throat attitude in the game and the theme of out competing your rivals.

RATING: 9.5
Very originally themed worker placement. The theme of representing a family of species adapting to a changing environment kind of falls apart under close scrutiny (mainly because, more often than not, you're adapting the environment to meet the needs of your species, rather than the other way around), but as this supports a more dynamic gameplay in which you can really screw other players over, I can't in all honesty say it bothers me that much.

This game has a very high level of interaction, which, to my experience, is unusual for a worker placement game. Rather than being limited to blocking actions for other players, you can actively seek to wipe them off the board. This creates a far more dynamic game, in which players who are behind can significantly impact those who are dominating the board.

Despite that, and perhaps because of the theme, which avoids words like "combat", people in my playgroup who are not in general fans of cutthroat games enjoy this as well. You can blow others out of the water, but you don't have to. Balance seems pretty good as well. The cards are very powerful, and as getting them is linked to scoring, players in can snowball quickly, but there's generally always a way back into the game.

There are lots and lots of actions you can take, and there seems to be a huge variation in the strategies that lead to victory. I loved this game. Ok, so I was biased - I had to wait 4 months for the copy I ordered to arrive, so I might've hyped it a little in my head. But it certainly lived up to expectations and I have to call it one of my absolute favorite games.

Having watched many a nature documentary and being a David Attenborough fan, the theme of evolution and supremacy really shone through in Dominant Species. 

Dominant Species is definitely a heavy Euro game, with knowledge of the 25 domination cards playing a critical role during play. Implication is some time has to be spent understanding and remembering the cards. Fortunately, there are "only" 25 of them.

The final round of the game is also particularly important, with as much as 50% of your VPs coming from the Ice Age and Survival cards, as well as the final scoring of every tile.

The game feels more suited for fewer players, and is more chaotic with more players. Downtime is also an issue with more players. The artwork (3rd edition) is fantastic and enhances the theme.

Intimidating at first but very intuitive and quick to teach. It certainly isn't for everyone though - one of my friends into lighter games hated this one and it really dragged the experience down for us all.

The play time and slightly dry procedural aspects of this held it back and I got rid of it since it didn't hit the table.

Too long and AP, but very interesting even with these minuses.

RATING: 10
Great theme, good designer, tons and tons of hype, and I'm glad I fell for it. This game is all that and a bag of chips. I love it! The worker placement mechanism is very cleverly implemented, and the way the timing of the actions work out will make you curse in frustration, or snicker with glee. The fact that the area control features 2 different metrics of resolution going on simultaneously in each area makes ones brain hurt, but it certainly is well designed and evocative of the theme. The elements work in a great way to tie the entire package together.

I upgraded to the 3rd edition board, cards and tiles, and must say that I like them a whole lot better than the 1st edition. It made it much simpler for me and my buddies to keep an overview of the game state.

Dominant Species is easily the most epic game in my collection, not only in theme, but implementation and game length. This is one heavy and very long game. The rules are fantastically well written and easy to understand, but in execution the worker placement mechanism becomes too difficult to manage, as you cannot hold all the permutations in your head. I've learned that one can keep 7 things actively in ones short term memory, but this drives past that at 65 mph and leaves it in the dust. You are faced with so many if-then statements that you are forced to play more by gut and instinct. Sure, you can have some sort of strategy from the start, but this is definitely a highly tactical game, sadly all those actions are already locked in and in many ways the game starts feeling like a programming game ala Space Alert.

This is my game of choice for gaming weekends, vacations or long conventions, but it will probably not come out at our regular gaming nights at all again.

Enjoy the ride, it's epic!


[b]Ideas for a shorter game:[/b]
1) Give everyone 1 extra AP. (Not sure if this won't have the opposite effect, as we already tend to take all the Domination Cards each round.)
2) Remove 5-6 of each Element from the bag, to even out the draws a bit.
3) Remove some cards, the consencus (even included in the rules) state to remove Immigrants, Intelligence, Omnivore, and Parasitism. Many add Blight to that list. I am of the opinion that removing the AP modifiers will handicap the animals at the bottom of the food chain. The Insects advantage is the initiative to grab Parasitism or Omnivore before anyone else can react.
4) Play with fewer Species cubes per player (say 5 less).

The drawbacks of a shortened game of Dominant Species seem to be that the last couple of turns are the most exciting, as players are running out of Species cubes, the Tundra is most valuable, and the Earth has grown so large that migrating across it is difficult at best. Missing out on this doesn't sound like much fun.

[b]Cardless Variant:[/b]
The "cardless variant" by the designer is interesting though. All cards except for Ice Age are put on the board face down, and when taken by the Dominant player, kept in front of them until the End Game. They score Bonus VP as normal for how many Domination Cards they have in front of them at the end of the game.

Too much going on here to make it really fun.

lets see, I can speciate, and add 3 pieces here, 4 pieces there, and 3 pieces over there.

Then they can fight, and kill 1 of my units here.

But then the third player can glaciate, and kill off all but 1 on this tile.

etc,etc.

Too large a permutation tree to feel like you can make good choices, and everything hinges on this decision tree.

An interesting game, but since this decision tree is so large and out of your control it is not as fun as it should be.

I played this with 5 and everyone liked it, but I regret purchasing it. If you figure a 4 hour base time, an hour to learn the rules, and an hour being slow due to not playing it recently, it totals 6 hours. Realistically, it's never going to hit my table again.

DS has a very slick design. A cascading worker placement system with area control. Each Species has its own unique feel and style of play. If you like brain burners this is it.

RATING: 7
A worker placement/qwirky area control game with a big splash of mean.  You get quite a good story out of this as species rise and fall on the map... but it is quite a brain burner and the swingy nature of the cards could turn some people off.  There is also not much in the way of those relax and breath moments like the dice rolling in Eclipse so a game of this leaves me more tired than my other epic games... or maybe it was the constant recalculating of dominance every time there was the slightest change of a species or on the board.  After a few games this ended up feeling more like work than fun... so I didn't need to keep a copy in my collection though I might still play every so often if offered.

This is a fantastic game,  though I find it is a bit of a long haul when played with the full 6 people.  I think that the sweet spot for this one is in the 4 player game.  I have not played it with 3 yet.

RATING: 8
UPDATE: Definitely better the second play, even though I came in dead last, due to my underestimation of the importance of endgame scoring.  Game flowed much better upon second play.  DS still seems one turn too long but captivating (for me) from start to finish.  Glad I played again, and would be glad to make it a regular in our circle's gaming stable.

I'm not exactly sure how to rate Dominant Species.  On one hand, it's got a lot of things going for it that I like - a strong theme, area majority, multiple ways to score, etc.  On the other hand, it feels overly long and chaotic.  My first game I shot out to an early lead after a couple of turns, then spent the next 3/4 of the game seemingly so far behind that I didn't see any way I could catch up to the leader.  I was some 20+ points behind the leader (5-player game) at game end.

That said, now that I know how the game works I would like to play again to see if it's just my perception that there's not enough ways to gain ground if you're behind, or if it was just my sub-standard play. ;)

In any event, the fact that I wrote this much about it and I would like to play again soon is pretty promising; I'll change my rating accordingly after my next play.

I think this must be a game for geniuses. It's incredibly complex, at least when you're first learning. I can't say I'm at all well versed in the mechanics, but altogether, the ideas are simple. The complexity comes from the sheer number of options you're presented with. Honestly, not my kind of game, and games like these make me realize I'm not so much of a eurogamer. Still, I think this game has to be great. At least, overwhelming.

RATING: 5
There are a great many excellent elements to this game.  The different animal powers are wonderfully balanced and flavorful.  The encroaching ice age works great (Settlers of the Stone Age-style).  Species competition, food chain order, adaptation, resource scarcity, all very cool.  

What ruins this game for me are the counter-intuitive dominance calculations.  There are two kinds of dominance, confusingly unrelated to one another.  One of them has to be tediously recalculated over and over and over.  Every time one of us got a token, lost a token, or added or removed a token from the board.  This could happen like 8 or 10 times PER TURN.

Another relatively minor complaint is that the domination card powers seem to be very unbalanced.  Like they got tacked onto the game at the last minute without being playtested.

I could not wait for my first game to end.  We wound up quitting after four hours.

I gave Dominant Species a 5, which was a composite of 8(I admire most of the game design) and 2(which is how much I want to play this game again).

I think this would be better with 4 players than 6...though then you lose some of the "food-chain order" coolness because the food chain gets so much shorter.

A nice brainburner with not too much randomness or hidden information. Looks quite abstract but contains more thematic elements than first appears. Longish but equally playable with almost any number of players. I'd like the animals to somehow differ from each other a bit more. Not recommended with 3 players: it's all too easy for them to keep scoring points for each other while ruining hours of the third player's life.

I will always play this game when it is offered. The mechanics are rock solid and the game has multiple paths to victory. It only ever seems long to me when I'm playing with AP prone players. My favorite animal group to play is mammals.

RATING: 6
Crunchy, extremely tactical worker-placement game with an awkward theme of intelligent design. A buffet-feast of interlocking game mechanics. Well-constructed as always with Mr. Jensen, but also per usual rides an uncomfortable line between abstraction and "realism". Good, but too long and with an unpleasantly mathy endgame.

RATING: 10
Simply brilliant.  If there's a complaint, it's that the components are a bit spartan.  The final scoring can be a bit fiddly as well, but if you're willing to invest in a three hour game as I regularly am, taking an extra 5 minutes on final scoring isn't a big deal.  This is the best worker placement game out there.

Az egyik legjobb játéknak tartom. ;) Nagyon mély, gondolkodós játék, végig feszült a helyzet, ami szerintem nagyban növeli a játékélményt. Lehet hogy jól állsz, de egyszer csak valaki elront mindent, vagyis nem elég a tudás, az előretervezés, a stratégia, a szerencse is szerepet játszik. Ádáz küzdelem folyik a fennmaradásért végig. Sokféleképpen alakulhat a helyzeted ebben kell megtalálni a legjobb utat. Sajnos túl sokan nem jó játszani max 4-en, mert nagyon elnyúlik a játékidő. Ajánlom mindenkinek aki szereti a mély összetett stratégiát.

our 4 player game took 4.5 HOURS from set-up finish. definitely too long for what it is. But on repeat plays its one of my favorite worker placement games, definitely best game of the genre in the last 3 years. But it could be short

RATING: 7
After 1 Play: It's bordering on too much chaos for its length, but in the end I think it succeeds.  I won my first game though, and it's much easier to accept chaos when it goes in your favor, so I'll have to play again to know for sure.

Only play this game if you are ready to hate everyone you are playing with. The direct conflict in Dominant Species is intense, and the opportunity for king-making is enormous. I like the mechanics a lot, but you certainly need to be ready to be annoyed if someone is playing 'sub-optimally' by targeting you, or to suddenly be hit in the face with a volcano and lose a dozen of your precious units.

Dość późno odkryłem tą grę bo dopiero w 2017r. Jednak ta gra zawiera wszystko co kocham w grach planszowych. Strategię, mocną interakcję, niesamowitą grywalność itd. Jedyny minus to "czasożerność". Dobre rozgrywki zwłaszcza w większej grupie potrafią trwać kilka godzin.  Gra z mojego TOP.

Devastador, donde todos los esfuerzos de tu especie se vuelcan en una cruda y violenta carrera por sobrevivir a costa de los demás. Pura guerra. Mil maneras de actuar en el tablero. Un juego que compré por el entusiasmo que se desató por él en el foro y que para mí es todo un 10. Juégalo a dos con una especie por jugador y sabrás lo que es tener más peones que usar en un turno que en cualquier otro juego. Cuando lo catas sabes enseguida que es uno de los one's.

A dos o tres jugadores maravilloso. Pero qué placer tener tanto peón para poner cada turno. Chulo de verdad.

Update 21/01/2018
I dropped its rating because it's hard to get it to the table
----------------------------------------------------------------
One of my all time favourites, 

I've owned it for so many years and yet i've only played it 10 times. It's long. Very long. Most games take us 3+ hours because there are always at least 1-2 players new to the game. Area control is my favourite mechanic and the combination of scoring and domination is excellent. So many decisions with every single action you take.

Domination cards can be devastating depending on the timing they are played. There are so many variables that it's impossible to make any sort of mental calculations, at least beyond the current round. That's the kind of game i adore. Brain burner but not in terms of accounting and maths.

Thematically it feels so right. For example two animals sharing the same elements are always at each other's throats because they are forced to share the same spaces and are fighting for majority and domination. 

It can be chaotic and players' decisions determine the balance in the game. If players are left alone they can thrive. On other hand if you are an early leader or you are the one who owns and explains the game you can be targeted.Which is usually what happens to me. it's a mean game but it rarely feels personal if players are making logical decisions. That's a sign of a great game.

A unique themed game with a lot of depth. The rules are very clearly written and the game is well balanced. There is a perfect integration of theme and gameplay. Generally there is a lot to think about during play, there are many moving parts. 
The endgame scoring is massive and that means the game stays exciting until the last round. 
The different species play different and have general strategies. 

Some minor quirks : 
A few unpredictable factors are in the game: which elements will come out of the bag each round and what cards will come out the following round. There's a lot of mitigation of it by good play, but once in a while a combination can come out that you can't really do anything about. 

The card that gives an Action pawn might be a little too strong, especially if it's out in the first round. 


edit : I now have the upgraded components and the game looks a lot more beautiful and more attractive to play.

Intensely tactical, mostly short term planning, but full of options. You can get wiped out and come back, but your prospects probably aren't good. Some of the cards score a *lot* of points; player order and grabbing the first dominate seems important for these when they pop up.

游戏体裁别处新颖，作为战棋大厂的版图试水作品，其严谨度和平衡性得到一定的保障，唯一缺点是游戏设计出的卡牌效果大小不一，对游戏的结果影响较大。这感觉好比在围棋中加入骰子，孰好孰劣留给大众来评价了。

I'll always suggest this game - although I'm often the only one. It is such a clever theme and so cleverly entangled with the mechanics. Not great for those with analysis paralysis but great fun in my book

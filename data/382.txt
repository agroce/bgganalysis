Brilliantly simple game of secret identities and deduction.  Plays quickly, and good with a lot of players, and has potential both as a family game or a start- or end-of-night filler.

I own the reprint of this one - did it just re-release in 2017? In any event, I like it. It is a hidden pawn game - similar to Quicksand and even Mr. Jack. Your color is only known to you and figuring out everyone else gains you extra points. I played all 3 versions of this: simple, adding cards then adding the full 'guess identity' rules. Very enjoyable and exceedingly simple. It's good to watch folks move around, get somewhat ahead but not too far to give away your role. The cards add some strategy moments. Good game, happy to now own it.

Enjoyable family game to play with the kids.  It's a good introduction to bluffing.

The components in the under cover version are quite nice.  The spies are large wooden pieces - good for kids to handle.

the game can be fun with lots or few people. With fewer people, you can just leave your guy on the 6(or above) space, and never touch him. No one else sees him move, so they assume his a dead player, so you get lots of points every time you score, so the game has its flaws

Read somewhere this shouldn't be played with 6 people and as all the games I played were with that number it is probably reflected in the rating.

Played the basic Heimlich and Co. Not really impressed - it seems to be a rather tiresome jockeying for position until someone finds themselves in an unstoppable position.  I would probably only play again with the 'guess your opponents' colour' variant.

From the historical perspective, the first score track around the outside of a board is credited to this game.  That said, the game is remarkable simple.  Game design has come a long way since its initial release.  Players are all trying to ensure that their secret spy is the one who advances to the finish line, but all the pieces can be moved by any player.  Depending on how movement scores are played out, it can be an easy task to deduce who has which spy or not.  Played quickly, the game is light fun entertainment.  There isn't a whole lot to the game, so don't enter it expecting deep game play.  Its basically a roll and move game with a nifty twist.

Beautiful bits, but that's the best thing about this game.  I really want to believe that there is more to this game than I've been able to find so far, but if you play with tricky players it is all but impossible to guess their identities,  Would like to try this with kids.  I've played with large number of players, I'd like to try with 4 or 5, and I think that then it would be a better game.

While this game may appear to be a roll-and-move game, the mechanic simply facilitates the deduction elements in the game. And as players attempt to hide their intentions, a strong meta-game evolves as players attempt to out-smart and manipulate each other. It all comes together in a fun, elegant, and entertaining way. And most gamers seem to enjoy it as it doesn't overstay its welcome and there is still plenty of useful information for players to work with.

I'm not quite sure which version or number of players is best... but this is a great game to start/end a gaming session.

Box bottom has a crease and a carefully repaired split corner.  Box top has a nicely repaired split corner.  Some shelf wear apparent.  Cards and rule set look a bit handled, but all agents, scoring markers and board look great.  Die is not original to the game if that matters to you.  If it does, let me know, and I'll replace the die in this set with the one from my personal copy.

[b]Spiel des Jahres 1986[/b]

[i]Posted: 5/18/06, Rated: 7[/i]

A seemingly simple game, that becomes more fun after repeated plays with the same group.  It's the [i]metagaming[/i] that really enhances the experience.

[i]Top Secret Spies[/i] (the title of the version which I own) is a roll-and-move game with a twist: anyone can move any of the wooden "spies."  Roll the die, and then use the number of pips showing as "movement points," which can be distributed however you see fit among all of the spies in play.  Some of those spies will secretly belong to a player.  Some will not.

The key then is to help your spy to earn the most points without being overt about it.  [i][GAMEID=4636][/i] has a similar "hide your side" mechanism.  It is a fun idea in theory, and enjoys a little novelty the first few times playing.  That novelty wears out.

This is the point where playing with the same people can make [i]Top Secret Spies[/i] that much more interesting: you start trying to second-guess your opponents based upon their behavior in previous games.  Has she been avoiding her real agent all this time?  Red seems to be creeping up the board, but not being pushed ahead too fast.  Maybe that's a clue.

Playing with the cards adds a bit more chaos and interest.  The theme is well-suited to the game, and earns an extra point for being engaging and fun.  An easy game to teach, and one that my entire family enjoys playing.  We prefer playing without the cards, but with the bonus points for correctly guessing the "controller" for each of the agents.

A very easy to pick up and play secret role game. Roll the die, move any piece to a numbered space. One a certain space on the board is landed on, those colored pieces will score points based on where they stand. I enjoyed this, but it fell sort of flat with the GF and her son, which is my main family style game audience. So, trade pile...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I'm terrible at this but that is in no relation to how much I like it. Absolutely wonderful. 
 
p: I have had great fun playing the basic game in the original Perlhuhn edition. It has no action cards, nor has it a second scoring round for correctly identifying agents. Still, I never even considered 'improving' the game with variations, the basic game was a rock-solid 8 to me. Until...
 
variant: After examening the Amigo edition I was shocked to discover action cards. They seem to add an element to the game that weakens its intriguing movement mechanism. However, and to my delight, the variation where you can earn extra points for correctly identifying who's behind which colour agent is a genuine improvement. No bluff can completely counter-act the illogical, inept and unwelcome way fellow players move your dobber about (my excuse at least). Even the most skillful player can sometimes score terrible simply because an agent gets used to trigger scoring, etc. So the option to earn bonus points for correctly identifying other players agents makes complete sense: it is at the heart of the game, and it also keeps players involved even if their agent 'is out of it'. Now I have found out about this optional rule, we will never play it any other way. 
 
I'm still doing terrible though, maybe I was born to play "Das Letzte Kamel" instead.

RATING: 7
I love hidden role/goal games, and apparently this is a classic in that genre. The rules are so ridiculously simple that it seems like it could almost be a kids game, but the strategy is just deep enough that kids might struggle to compete. I like trying to balance moving my piece just enough to get in position for points, but not so much that I give away my identity. It does seem that it can get tough if you get stuck and no one will help you move your piece out of the low numbers, but that's where a good bluff becomes necessary. I actually like playing with some non-player characters, because it adds the potential that you could move a piece other than your own to convince others it belonged to you, then they might move your actual color for you. I'm kind of excited, because this appears to be one of the few hidden goal games that Rikki actually enjoyed playing. I hope that means I can play it much more often. I am also extremely anxious to try the variant where you guess other player's color. It seems that would add one more layer of fun and intrigue to this already enjoyable game.

A rather bland bluffing & deduction game.  The basic game is okay.  The advanced game with the "Top Secret" cards is just painful... it just drags as people play and pick up cards to deny points to opponents.  The game is probably best played with the secret dossier variant where everyone can get bonus points for correctly guessing the identity of opponents and the unused spies.

I think the thing that turns me off about this game is the bluffing because the game is simplistic and hiding your identity (color) requires you to make counter-productive moves frequently/consistently.

Juego para grupos de cierto tamaño (me lo dió a conocer Gixmo en el CiberChigre de Gijón en Feb 2010 y eramos 8 jugadores). 

Se trata de un juego de deducción y despiste.. puesto que todos los jugadores pueden manejar todas las fichas y repatir los puntos de movimiento como crea conveniente.. Cuando se cae en la casilla ocupada por una especie de ataud, se procede a la puntuación y cada ficha puntúa según donde se encuentre en ese momento. No se averigua quién es quién, hasta que alguno llega al final (40 puntos).

Reglas muy, muy sencillas y facil de explicar y jugar para cualquiera. Ideal para comenzar jornadas o compartir con no jugones.

I don't really like this game, but my kids enjoy it, so we end up playing it a lot more than I care for.  It's fun watching the kids try to score points without tipping everyone off as to who they are (it's fun to watch because they are so bad at it!).  I like it better with fewer players (4 is perfect) because there seems to be enough time and moves to potentially figure out who is which color.  With 7 players it is really difficult to make those calls unless someone is obvious with their moves.

Gack! This is a Kramer? I guess it just shows how far the gaming scene has progressed in 20 years. The problem here is that like so many roll-n-move games, it seems like you're just a slave to the dice. Roll big numbers and you've got some options and some interesting decisions. Roll low numbers and you're a spectator. The dice games that succeed are the ones that allow the dice to vary the game and keep things fresh (Settlers, Can't Stop, To Crown a King) without railroading you. Here, I felt railroaded. Maybe next time I'll roll 6s all the time and it'll be an OK game ... but I doubt it. Regardless, I doubt I'll play again.

This is another game that might be OK for families or gaming groups with adults and younger kids. But hobby gamers are likely to be frustrated and/or annoyed.

Okay (because it's short) hidden identity game. Must be played with the objective of trying to identify the other players colour. The cards used for the advanced game on the other hand make things way too chaotic and are best left in the box.

Okey tryed it yesterday 2 times and didnt liked it all, now this version (Scandinavian edition 1986) was without the "spy cards" that i have read some about. But the basic didnt feel that great... 

Both me and my wife got bored really quickly, and didnt feel it was that much bluffing involved (we usually love those bluffing games), sure you move some characters and you are only one of them, but in my opionion "Quicksand" is so much better than this game!

Im gonna give it a try with the "spy cards" and see if it helps. I cant really put my finger on what it is that this game is missing. Maybe its just TOO light? 

I also have some own variants working in my head to maybe increase the rating..? 
But for the basic game i can only give it 3.5

A game for non-gamer families and a winner for people who like Clue.  With the mystry of not knowning whose spy is whose, makes the game very interesting as the winner is the first spy to reach the end (generally).  However, you can't just move your spy forward or everyone will know which spy is yours.  So the delima - how to get your spy to the lead and not let everyone know which spy is yours.

We have the Under Cover version where you only use 2 more pawns than the number of players, rather than all 7 pawns.  We play with 2 players, which works fine.  This fast-paced game is also very easy to learn.  Thinking that others change their strategies from game to game adds a good deal of second-guessing.  The board and components are both nice-looking.

RATING: 2
Kramer's homage to Sartre. Players are thrust into a dark world with no exits. They are forced to run in circles, simultaneously pursuing and being pursued, but never finding fulfillment. The church offers no help.

In all seriousness, I don't really get this game. You have to hide your identity, but you also seemingly have to move your own piece quite a bit because relying on the benevolence of the other players probably won't get you very far.

In our game, it seemed as though the best scorings happened through good tactical use of the board positions that the other players leave behind...lie low, and then strike when you see an opportunity. The thing is, that that opportunity is almost completely up to what the other players are doing and also depends heavily on getting a decent roll on the die. 

I don't think the "advanced" rules really do much to help, because the players seem to want to lie low until they can get a very significant score from revealing themselves...and that didn't seem to occur very early in the game.

I think it's odd that the game simultaneously encourages effective bluffing and punishes it. You have to move your piece unless the other players are completely crazy, but you can't move it too much. A conflicted game.

Not one of Kramer's finer hours.

Not a bad game at all, in fact it would probably be a great game for families with kids.  It's one of those things where you're going to have as much fun as you and your group bring to the table.  It's a pretty harmless secret identity/deduction game with a couple of interesting decision points throughout a typical game but is it something to play with any frequency?  Probably not.

I forgot to enter my detailed comments when I played (only once). I recall that the device to determine your move options was pretty nifty, but it was also annoying to get the "you can't do anything" this turn color (white?). I think it was actually somewhat fun to play, but not a game I would ever suggest or seek to play. I'm also somewhat biased against deduction games.

Played with the cards for the first time tonight and I can't say that I recomend them.  If you like randomness do it, otherwise stick with the base rules.

It's impressive to see how well the SdJ winner from 1986 still holds up today.  The game is based on such a simple concept, and it would work great with families.

This is a simple bluffing game with an ounce of deduction thrown in.  Players roll a die and split the movement between the 7 detectives.  Once a detective lands on the house with the secret file in it, all detectives advance the number of spaces for the house number they are in - but watch out for the Ruin, which gives negative points!  The twist is each player is secretly playing a detective, so you have to be careful who you move to throw others off the scent.

For an advanced game you can have players write down each others' identities at the halfway point.  Nice if you're into deduction, but I like the simple core of this game.  A fast, pleasant filler for groups of 4 or more.

Components: Typical Amigo production quality: perfect.

Experience: So much chaos, as my pawn is at the mercy of my opponents, but there is so much wonderful tension, as I triy to maneuver my pawn without giving away my allegiance to it, and at the same time trash everyone else's pawns, and hopefully cause someone to reveal their own identity. A simple, psychological game.

Playing with Gary, Linda and Stuart this was a real blast. 

I think that bluff games are best served by simpler rules with a clearly superior 'mathematically perfect' play but with real potential for screwage if you follow that 'perfect' play.

Then comes all the psychology - knowing that you'll be scuppered if you reveal your hand, how do you balance furthering your own agenda with hiding it.

Heimlich and Co is definitely simple enough to allow the bluffing to be focused on but whether it's perfectly balanced or not will only be revealed after a lot more play. It definitely held up for the first 2 games I played.

Scuppering someone should maybe be easier. As is, it takes a concerted effort from at least 2, maybe 3 opponents to actually screw a character over. Maybe a '-7' before the '-3' would help here, at least allowing the 3 players to do some serious damage.

I'm not sure there's enough here to actually make staying undercover the best strategy. Having read reviews just now promoted this idea, given that we were playing without the cards.

The dice rolling and bluffing keep it light.

Feels very fast. I'd play this anytime.

RATING: 5
Formally published as Heimlich &amp; Co./Undercover. Players take on the role of a secret agent, who&#039;s identity is hidden. The agents are moved en masse around the board. If an agent reaches the safe space then a scoring round is triggered. Each agent scores points for the space the reside on, which varies from -3 to 10. The idea is to keep your identity hidden, while still scoring handy points. There are a few variants included in this new edition of the game - action cards, and guessing the identity of the other players for more points. Nice and light bluffing game.

Kind of an advanced version of Midnight Party: you move people around the circular track to score, but instead of a push-your-luck ghost chasing you [kicking you negative points and ending the game] you just play until someone scores a lot of points. 
 
I like the silly action of Midnight Party more.

I tend to like Kramer's games and this being a SdJ, I figure you can't go wrong.  Well, it's alright.  Trying to obfuscate your moves as much as possible seems an easy task, but the real key here is to have a good tracking system.  One game I played a first time player just ticked off the number of times each player played each color and guess what?  He was 100% correct on all of his declarations at game's end.  Don't know about you, but if a game as one specific trick that works almost all the time, then the magic just isn't there for me anymore.

It's an okay game in my book but does suffer from that sort of "secret role" mechanism where it's quite clear by the end who is who. The manipulation of the detectives also can't escape the rather luck-driven system of die rolling. Still, there's few games that play well with 6 people and can be enjoyed by all ages. So for that, I still show mad respect.

An underrated early masterpiece by Kramer.  This one has quickly become the most played in our group.  Full of bluffing, psychology, and tactical decisions. Great fun!  Prefer the edition with the top secret spy cards, but prefer the look of the original Heimlich.

UPDATE:  I have changed my mind in respect to the top secret cards.  I believe I prefer the streamlined simplicity of playing without them.  Although the card play can offer some more depth, more often than not the cards are played by someone not evaluating the status of the game and inadvertently handing victory to another player.  When the cards are used according to the rules set, seating position in respect to fellow players becomes as important as good bluffing, which hurts the classic game Heimlich is.  In ways, it brings the same discontent from players as having a poor player next to you in Puerto Rico.

This has stood the test of time with me, and is always fun.

Third play caused a significant rating drop.  The card play seems way too chaotic, and rewards you for having the perfect combination of cards at game's end.  I want to read the rules to make sure we're not doing something incorrectly, because something just doesn't seem right.

Our family of 4 played this once so far.  I can see the kids will need practice hiding which color they are.  After my daughter's first move I knew which color she was.  (I would imagine the better you know a player the easier it is to figure out their "tells".  My husband was a bit obvious too, my 8 year old leaned over & asked me if I thought Daddy was blue (she was correct)! Will be interesting to see how this game evolves.  
I must say I'm a bit surprised it won awards, seems a bit simple to me.  Maybe I'll uncover more "content" as time passes.

I am completely at a loss as to why this game is often held in such high regard.  It's supposed to be a bluffing game, but successfully bluffing does not put you in a position to win.  A totally banal game, at least among adults.  Kramer himself in 1989 singled out Heimlich & Co as a game that wasn't really one of his favorites, despite its commercial success.

This might be the very first game that exposed me and my brothers to German games. Not quite classically Euro, but it was still sui generis to us when we were kids, and we enjoyed the bluffing inherent in moving detectives and the safe around. I always found it entertaining when my brothers could figure out who I was even though I had tried my darndest not to move my color too much.

Probably my first exposure to a German style game.  My sister brought this back from a trip to Germany, and we muddled through the rules (remember this is before the internet, so there was no handy vast database of knowledge from which we could download an English translation, video example of play, and hundreds of player aids/game pimps/tuckboxes etc. -- it was a dark time and I honestly don't know how humanity survived).  A family favorite still.

What impressed me about this game, and it's still a mark of a great game, is that the game engine does what it needs to do and then gets out of the way.  The players play, threaten, guess, even bribe, and the game itself sits nicely in the background letting everybody have a good time around it.

The base game is, well, basic.
Must be played with the cards (but without the card allowing you to have a second spy) and the optional rule where you must discover the agents' indentity.
This last rule makes bluffing much more important.

A very nice tactical movement game where you will need to guess who the other players are about 3/4 of the way into the game. You are trying to "deduce" who is who by how people move all the men around and there is a lot of bluffing around this movement.  

Very simple to teach (1 minute) and easy to play. I'm not sure adding the cards will make a better game as the simple elegance is a big plus without them and this makes it good family fare, will try it and comment later. 

Name of the Rose is a nice updating of this however this is the simpler and faster game to play with about the same end results (NOTR is like a meatier version). A great pure fun type game with a little skill that plays in about 25 - 30 minutes, usually a second round is requested right after first play. Makes a great gateway or family game that can still be enjoyed by a gamier crowd.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (January 2011)

When I played Heimlich & Co. I found it to be a very novel game. It was the only game I knew at the time who had a secret identity mechanism (perhaps my favorite game mechanic). Since its been years since I last played it, I don’t remember much about the game.

I’m downgrading its rating to one I feel match my feelings for the game with BGG´s recommended rating system.

I want to play it again, and when I do, I will come back to write my impressions. Perhaps it is too light for my current tastes.

RATING: 6
The secret-player-colour idea is the game's major feature, and an element of if-you-push-the-limit-you-get-nothing. Which is to say there aren't many features of this game.  But the balance is ok.  If you have enough players you lose the "secret identity" element since you'll win if you shamelessly favour yourself from the start while others mess about trying to stay secret.

seems to lack any reason to be played - I'm guessing that it is actually playable with only 3 or 4 players - not 6 or 7 - as the more players the fewer non-player pieces - perhaps you should play with twice the number of tokens as the number of players (so with a 6 player game, you would have 12 tokens to be moved on the board)>>

My rating is for the basic version.  I'm not big into the secret roles type of games, and so the simpler the better when it comes down to playing them.  This really is about as simple as it can get.  I like that players who just come out and show who they are can really get punished for doing so, while players who tend to hide their identity can do quite well.  I wish to try it again with the new rules, but I need to get some translations going due to having a German version.

Great game, Clans older cuz. The more players the better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There are 7 pawns which are secretly assigned to each player. The board is a circular track of buildings with point values from 1-10 with also a (-3) ruin and a zero-point church. On a turn, a player rolls a die and moves any combination of pawns up to the total number rolled. Players try to position themselves on good point buildings without revealing their identity. All buildings score when a pawn lands on the scoring marker, which a player moves to a new building after scoring. Three-quarters of the way through, players then have to secretly guess the identities of all the pawns. At the end of the game, each correct guess gives 5 bonus points. If you play with less than 7 players, then there always one or two "unaffiliated" pawns that can complicate the guessing. 5 players is probably best, since players are less motivated to hide if EVERY pawn represents a player.

There's a lot to think about in this simple little game, making it one of the better "family" games I've played. It combines bluffing and deduction in a way I haven't seen. It reminds me a little bit of Liar's Dice, where your deductions are based on the behavior and actions of the other players - but I like this game far more, probably because there is more here that is under your control. Lots of great table talk. Very social.

RATING: 6
I like the simplicity of the game mechanics. Without the action cards, the game boils down to bluffing. There is little control from a tactical or strategic level. If you can get your character within 10 points of the end, you can make a gambit for a win. The rest of the time, you hope someone brings up your character.

The action cards add an interesting twist; although, with them, the game suffers the same issue as Munchkin or Kill Doctor Lucky. The game can drag because players continually inhibit someone from winning by playing take-that cards.

The optional deducing player characters for victory points sounds like a great addition. We didn't play that variant though.

A game that was way ahead of its time, and in some ways, has never been improved upon.  I'm thinking specifically of games like In the Name of the Rose, which only add length and added mechanics that don't increase the fun.

The main advantage this has over all the other "conceal your identity" games is the short playing time.  If people aren't taking too long there's no reason why this shouldn't wrap up in about 20 minutes, which is about right.  It handles a large group well, though it can be chaotic.

I've only played the original Heimlich & Co. version, without the special cards.  I think it's just fine like that.  I would be open to playing the newer version, though I can't help but think that the new cards wouldn't add that much.

RATING: 5
The ideas behind that game is interesting, but the game is based around 1 mechanic and I think I would have wanted more.

I don't like the guessing part because I don't have a good memory enough to remember what people have done. I would have needed to keep track of it for the whole game.

Once you are uncovered, it's almost over for you. You don't have and optional path to victory and that's annoys me. So you must make sure that you are not uncovered until the end.

The card which allow you to own 2 colors is pretty much powerful and unbalancing on my point of view. I think eveybody should have had 2 colors or maybe have a chance to switch their color in the middle of the game if they get uncovered.

Anfangs erhält jeder Spieler verdeckt seine Spielerfarbe ausgeteilt (geheim). Wer an der Reihe ist würfelt und verteilt die Würfelaugen auf die 6 Agenten im Spiel. Falls ein Agent auf den Tresor zieht erhalten alle Agenten so viele Punkte, wie auf dem Ort angegeben auf dem sie stehen.
Sobald ein Agent mit seinem Punktemarker die 42 erreicht oder überschreitet, endet das Spiel und es gewinnt der Spieler, dessen Agent am meissten Punkte hat.
In der Mitte des Spiels war mir schon klar dass einem Spieler "gelb" gehören muss. 2 Runden vor dem Ende wusste ich dass ein Spieler blau und ein anderer gelb sein muss. Ich konnte meine graue Figur aber nur bis zur 41 pushen, da der Tresor auf der 10 stand und grau 31 Punkte hatte. Damit hatte ich mich verraten und grau wurde 2x auf die -3 gesetzt und gepunktet ;(
Nettes Spiel, aber lieber mit 8-10 jährigen Kindern. :)

A simple but original bluffing/deduction game. Pretty much optimal for introducing primary/middle school aged kids to the genre. As is usually the case with Ravensburger, the board, cards, and components get top marks for artistic flair and unity of vision. I think some kids might be distracted, though, by how little the point-scoring mechanism has to do with the game's ostensible "theme."

A great game, players always trying to disguise their real identities. Also very simple, but not that quick (usually takes around 45 minutes). I don't like too much the endgame, when several players are close to win but need a lucky throw of the die to do it. But is very enjoyable, specially with non-gamers. Having one or more pawns that belong to nobody also add a lot of options to the game.

[Ravensburger] This is a fun filler although it's not too interactive.  I highly recommend you play with the advanced rules (where you get points for guessing the secret identities of your opponents at the end of the game).  Without the advanced rules the game would be one-dimensional and many of the movement choices would be obvious (when you're not trying throw off your opponent's guesses).

aka-Heimlich & Co.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In Heimlich & Co. players are spies running around a block of houses trying to score points. There is a safe that represents the trigger for scoring. When a pawn stops at a location with the safe scoring is triggered and all the paws score depending on the number value of the house that they’re on. The catch is that players do not know which color belongs to which player and must then guess at the end of the game what color belongs to whom. A deductive type game that plays up to 7 players. It’s very simple and easy to explain, light and plays relatively fast

I found Heimlich & Co. to be a little too random. It was hard to deduce who the players were as movement can be played fairly obtusely without tipping your hand away too much each turn. A Charming and a clever mechanic but it seems to fall more on luck than strategy.

The deduction game of Heimlich & Co must have been ground-breaking when it came and I really like the freedom of moving all pieces in a way that benefit your secret color without revealing it. However, there is no subtle way of improving your color's position so your destiny is in the hands of the other players. I've won thanks to one player promoting color to divert the other players' attention and I've seen colors being randomly selected for bashing, making it impossible for a player of that color to win. Still, a good mechanism that has been developed into perfection in games like Clans.

We played this game in it's latest reincarnation as Top Secret Spies. There are 7 spies on the board, roll dice and move any of them. Score points for spies at certain intervals, but the trick is that the owner of each spy is kept secret. Earn points if you correctly guess the identities of the spies. This game really needs the Heimlich manouevre to save it. Sure, the aspect of trying to guess who owns which piece has some tension, but the points awarded for that are not worth the points one earns during the game for being in certain buildings. Strategy wise, it doesn't much make sense not to get 7 or 8 pts and let everyone know your color. A Wolfgang Kramer game, but this game is bad.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
Played this hidden role-esque came a while ago, once at a meetup. I really like that ALL players control everyone else's player and the scoring is simple, yet gives room for intrigue.

Issues: Kind of luck based sometimes whether players will move your color or not, colorblind people have trouble (I certainly did - I wish they had symbols/numbers as well), and one player pulling ahead blantantly isn't unheard of either. Its also a little hard to remember who and what moved sometimes when you're trying to deduce a character.

Possible improvements: Some versions I think give bonuses for players who can deduce others' identities. One alternative I can think of is that if anyone can deduce your identity, you lose even if you're in first place. This keeps going until there's a player who remains unknown and has highest points wins. I also think something like a two page white board (like in Telestrations) could've been a nice addition. One side to keep track of notes, and the other side could be used when everyone simultaneously guesses the character's player controller.

Overall, still a neat game with a cool concept for its age (I believe this was pre 2000)

One of the very first German-style game I have encountered. Used to play this a lot using handmade board (using Monopoly board as a score track) and pieces. It was very fun as I had never seen anything like this. After I got the real copy (Undercover) as a gift, I didn't play this much anymore. The problem is there is no real strategy/tactics that which piece to move as you want to be as random as possible (to hide your identity) but you want to be ahead is two contradicting objectives. So people just play very defensively to make sure everyone's scores are about same, and just pure guessing who is who after 3rd corner.

In this very refined bluffing race game players have got to keep their identities hidden while making sure they score enough to reach the goal first. This makes the gameplay rather tense but also means that it's mainly the end that matters, and that players can actually win by doing nearly nothing throughout a round. Still, Heimlich & Co remains a cunning, perfidious double guessing feast. A classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Playing with the deduction rules is really the only way to treat this game, but there's a narrow width of player count that means this option is really only accessible with 6P. And it's kinda slow to get started. It's certainly not just a family game, but there are a few flaws for gamers too.

Heimlich & Co. was an auction purchase from Prezcon last weekend for $4. It was new in shrink, so I felt I got a pretty good deal. Anyway, Heimlich was a game I'd been interested in but had never really pursued. However, it's the sort of secret victory condition games that are great for families. I was surprised at how starkly simple this game is, and how great it is for a roll and move game. The kids LOVED it. Wanted to play again and again. Brought in some of the neighbor kids who are my kids' friends and THEY loved it too. They were all talking about wanting to come in and play more games. Always a good sign!

Someday I'm going to write an article on why 90% of bluffing games are crap. Bluffing games need to give you two things:

A.) Enough information to make good guesses at the bluffed or hidden information.
B.) Powerful enough resources to act on your deductions and stop your opponents' plan.

Heimlich has a decent amount of A, but not enough of B. I think I could play with my role exposed and still win in some cases.

No great shakes from a contemporary point of view, but it's easy to see how this game began to pave the way for Euro-style games. That is, it plays fast, is easy to learn, offers a number of choices along the way, doesn't eliminate players but participants aim to achieve the highest score to win, and it's fairly abstract but enjoyable overall. 

I guess I hoped for more to it than there is, plus it didn't get much of a reaction from my family. I can see how in context it was a significant forerunner of a Euro-style game, but on the other hand, so many games that perhaps can be traced, in part, to this one have surpassed it.

It is a fine game.  And that's just it, it's just fine.  Not knowing who's which color is a great idea, but I don't believe that it makes for much of a great game.  It lacks something.  One eventually ends up moving his own piece just to make sure that he doesn't lag behind, pretty much leaving his identity obvious to anyone who's half paying attention.  There just isn't enough for me to like it.  It should really be printed in a smaller box format and sold for much less, because that's exactly what it is... much less than I expected.  A children's game, of course.  The pieces are of good quality.

Inventive roll and move game with a bluffing element. The original board is a thing of beauty compared to the newer version but a pity the zero and minus three spots were neglected. The game has lots of reskinning potential too.

As a friend of mine said "we may as well just play the game without looking which character we are, then when a color finishes, flip over the cards to see who won".

I feel as though this game may be better with 2-3 players where each player has more control of the game.  Playing with 5 is a crap shoot and not even remotely fun, other than complaining obviously.

RATING: 5
Each player is assigned a secret agent of a particular colour. Roll a die. Move any agents any combination around a circular track. Trigger occasional scorings by landing an agent on the secret(s) safe. Whoever owns the agent with the most points at the end is the winner. ‘Advanced’ rules give you an extra 5 points for correctly guessing at the three-quarter mark the colour agent that each player owns. I really don't see the point of hidden colour games - you might be, you might not be, are you bluffing, are you not. Impossible to know to start with so keep everything bunched, throw a few red herrings and get lucky towards the end because people believed otherwise - or not. In the end, who cares. You didn't get to do anything cunning, clever, strategic or fun. At least it's only 20 minutes.

Awsome. Such easy and simple rules, yet tricky. With the standart rules you point the fingers at each other and do false accusations and speculate loud out trying to influence the way your opponents play.

This is such a strange game-for me-it is one of the most mood and group relevant game I know.  It can be a really, really fun experience or something the table just wants to end. 

I like it, though.  I've thought it a great game for end of the night relaxation.  Cool mechanic of trying to guess who your opponents are.

Make sure you play advanced version where you need to try and pick who is who when someone passes that last point on the scoreboard.

A game of deception. Very simple; all you do is move one of seven spies, in which one is you and you try to be as high up on the track as possible when you score. But if you let others know too early who you are, your chances of winning are reduced as about half way through, everyone guesses which player is which color and the more you get correct, the more points you get. The problem is that the game is very repetitive and can get very long as there is a negative point space and the game end is triggered by reaching 41 points. After about 30 minutes, it just gets dull.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I never know what strategy to use in this game.  Do I move my own piece, risking that everyone will realize which one I am?  Or do I move only other people's pieces, hoping that they'll gang up on one of those?  The game is interesting and plays well with larger groups.

A game by Kramer + winner of the Spiel des Jahres 1986 + deduction, CIA was a game I just added to my collection because of that, but strayed unopened for 4 years in my collection. Finally got to play this, immediately with both variants, as all players are experienced players. Were I thought it had a deduction element in it, I seemed to be wrong. It's more an outguessing game, were it's helpful to know who has which secret colour. 

It's not a bad game, but you sort of feel that this is an 'old' game of almost 20 years old. Those games have some advantages though: easy rules and a thin rulebook and quite straightforward play.

I might try this again, but we couldn't figure out how to make it fun. Too much roll and move. It was pretty easy to figure out who everyone was. The game could be prolonged forever once everyone was near the end. Needs an alternative end of game condition.

Used to play this with my Dad and brother. Pretty much a game in the style of 'identity disguise', such as Mr.Jack or 13 Dead End Drive. While the playing pieces are not very nice to look at, the board and cards are quite neat. A simple game which nicely balances random elements (dice) and bluffing.

EDIT I: The game can really become surprisingly tense during the last stretch on the score track, when it is all about preventing others from winning while making sure your guy stays close enough for the snipe victory 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game has been published in 1984! The version I played had impressive components including massive wooden figures about 5 cms tall.
In this game you try to fool other players. You draw a card so you are one of the six figures on the board. You throw a dice and then you move some figures and if a figure lands on a house with the safe, scoring occurs.
A fast paced fun game! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Quick bluffing and deduction game. Very abstract and dry, but the quickness of this game (especially with seven players) makes up for this.

UPDATE: Raised this from a 7 to a 9. This is a surprisingly well balanced take-that game! The take-that cards, the Top Secret cards, actually *add* to the strategy of the game, rather than adding chaos (as you would expect from take-that cards).

Typically, in a take-that game, players can, right from the start, attack opponents with little effort. Players attack each other at basically the same rate, which makes a repetitive game, or more accurately, a game without a story arc and no rising tension.

In Top Secret Spies, you simply can't attack your opponents right from the start -- the starting position prevents that, and you don't know who your opponents are. You can't even help yourself early in the game either because you don't want to give away your identity. As the game progresses, players slowly deduce who's who, attacks become more and more directed, and players take more and more risks helping themselves out.

Near the end of the game, it is a pure take-that game since everyone by now *should* know each player's identity. But to get to this point, it takes a lot of thoughtfulness. So when you, for example, prevent a specific opponent from scoring ten points and instead make him lose three, it simply feels so good because you weren't able to do it at the start of the game. Basically, you earned the right to totally screw someone over, which is way more satisfying than a take-that game, in which you can screw people effortlessly.

I typically hate games with random, special action cards, but in this case, whenever a player uses one of them, he typically gives away a lot of information about his identity, since some of them can be quite powerful.

Bluffing and deduction. Each player knows only their own color, rolling dice and moving any pieces along an oval track, aiming to have their piece furthest along when the game ends.

Update1: Elolvasva az angol szabalyt mar talaltam egy hibat amit rosszul jatszottunk, kartyak a jatekos csak a sajat koreben huzhat (azaz elotte van a kocka). Ha masnak a kore van es valami miatt egy ugynokot a romokba mozgat, nem huzhat kartyat.
Update2: Az otletem az, hogy a handlimit legyen lecsokkentve 3-ra es egy Top Secret korben csak egy kartyat jatszhasson ki egy jatekos. Azaz barmikor a rendes szabalyok szerint, de ha mar kijatszott akkor abba a fazisba mar nem szolhat bele, igy egy erdekes taktikai csata is valhat belole. A masik szabaly, hogy ha egy pontjelzo athalad a 29-es mezon es a jatekosok feljegyezhetik, hogy szerintuk ki-melyik ugynokkel van es a jatek vegen ezek + vagy tevedes eseten - pont is lehet, szerintem nagyon otletes.

This was a decent diversion. Bluffing games are okay, but this one seems hard to keep your identity a secret. Or you can try to count on others moving you, which isn't a very good option either. The cards make it interesting, but very chaotic. I'd play, but wouldn't suggest it.

Wow, this is a fun little filler. It probably has the simplest ruleset ever, but it works so unbelievably well.

Under Cover version.

This game probably works best for two to five players using the basic rules.

Each player is assigned a secret colour. Players then move their pieces of choice based on a roll on D6. Scoring is triggered when a piece steps into the location of the 'safe'. All pieces score VPs based on their current location at time of scoring. First piece to 42 VPs wins! 

Famous for the VP-track (Kramerleiste) that we is so common in Eurogames.

There are several other variants I haven't tried. Good fun and has been replicated in games such as Quicksand.

A simple deduction game that excels because of it's simplicity. Roll a die, move the pawns and try to deduce whom is what color based on their pattern of choices (if there is one).

A két első játék alkalmával csak az alapjátékot próbáltuk ki, így ez alapján értékeltem 6-osra a játékot. A másik két verzió biztos több érdekességet visz a játékba.
Igazi következtetős játék, az alapjátékban nem túl nehéz kikövetkeztetni ki melyik ügynökkel lehet, szerintem a kártyás verzióval lesz igazán jó a játék.

This is a simple party game.  Nothing all that exciting, but it plays quick and when you are in the right mood it can a bunch of fun.  I would definately recommend playing this with the advanced rules, otherwise there really isn't much of a game here.

This is more of a social experience than a game, but a relatively fun experience.

Or is it, rather this is an existential journey round and around.  Who are we?  Am I blue?  No secrets are revealed in church.  The road to ruin is minus three points...

Bought really cheaply from eBay, but unplayed. I'm not a great bluffer, so I can see how I might lose a lot at this game since it's pretty much all bluff. EDIT: I think the dice help mitigate the fact that I'm not a great bluffer and since there are nonplayer pieces on the board, the uncertainty is pretty high.

It's like The Name of the Rose, but much simpler and less interesting. In fact, it was kind of boring. Just one play, but I'm not likely to play it again!

--- Summary ---
Each player is secretly assigned one of the detective meeples, all of which start on the 0 space of the track. The circular track goes 0-->10, -3, back to 0. The safe starts out on the 7. On your turn, roll the d6 (1-3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = movement points; spend these to move any tokens clockwise. If playing with the cards, players then have the opportunity (once-around, starting with whoever wants to play first) to play as many cards as they want (start game with 2; draw 1 extra each time you roll "1-3" and decided to skip moving). The cards move the safe, or move meeples. After all the dice/card movement, if a meeple has been moved to the safe's location, scoring occurs: move score markers according to the meeple locations on the track. The game ends when any color scores > 42 (?) points; the player whose color is furthest ahead wins.

The whole point is to move your color ahead without anyone knowing it's your color. But to keep the mystery alive, we kept all the colors relatively close to each other until they approached the end of the track. It all seemed kinda pointless!

RATING: 5
I can see where this was fun back in the day, but it's one title that I don't think has held up that well and I'm not usually one to knock older games.  I think it would work better as a children's game, although my own were never interested in playing.  As an adult game, though, it's too easy to conceal your identity and ultimately becomes a game of luck.  Too random.

[Ravensburger 'Heimlich & Co.' 86 Edition] {Agent, filler; secret identity, roll-and-move; optimal 4-5p} {6 basic game, 6 advanced rules} Interesting family game about bluffing and deduction. Welcome by my friends. It is suitable for both adults and kids.

However, gamers may find this game hard to control and luck-driven. Players can't form a very good strategy due to the chaos. One strategy is very obvious - hide one's identity well in early game and grab points in late game. 

The advanced rule is not a must. Since the game is short, players usually have not enough information (esp. all experienced players) to guess who's who.

[New edition] The new action cards seem fun but it somehow destroys the simplicity and elegancy of the original game.

Similar to Clans in that you are trying to score for your color without the other players knowing which color is really yours.  Game of deduction by Kramer, but how well does it play with 2?  Consider the variant where you only play with 2 more spies than players -- does this make it work better with 2 players?  Recommended for people who like Clue.

Players take the role of spies (sort of). Waaaaay tacked on theme. Let me take off the theme and explain. Everyone is secretly a colored pawn. On your turn you will move any of the players around the point track. When a pawn hits the scoring box, everyone score. When enough points have been accumulated, everyone writes down a guess as to which player is what color. When enough more points have been scored, the game ends and players score bonuses for correct answers. Sounds ok, but in execution, its too easy for gamers to make the guess phase a total - guess.

RATING: 8.6
Attractive, quick-playing game.  Interaction galore.

As soon as the agent cards are dealt out it goes a lot like this:

"Daddy's green!"
"Daddy's purple."
"You're red!"
"Daddy's red!"

and so on and so on until...

"Daddy's [i]SO[/i] orange!!"

Excellent bluffing game, great family fun.  Children will enjoy it even if they don't 'get it'.  

Have only played with three & four, but I believe the game would lose some of its flavor with any more than five playing.  The two neutral agents are crucial.

I was pleasantly surprised by this old gem.  It takes the secret color allocation mechanic from Clans (or I suppose which Clans takes from it based on their release dates) and applies it to a better game that doesn't have the same sort of arbitrary spatial decision-making.  The dice rolling in Heimlich makes it very luck heavy, but the game is quick and light-hearted enough to make it work well.  So well that I happily played it back-to-back, which is a rare thing for me.

RATING: 5
I'd heard Heimlich & Co. (or this version "Top Secret Spies") was a quicker alternative to The Name of the Rose. I love NotR because of the theme, but it does sometimes feel long.


In TSS you're rolling a die and moving Agents around a track where all the buildings have increasing values. There's one building that has a value of -3. There's a bank safe that will be moved around the board. Whenever an agent ends their movement at the safe there is a scoring round and every agent gets points according the value of the building they are in. Then the person who triggered the scoring round puts the safe at a new location.

You want your agent to be near the end of the track to score lots of points, but that also puts them close to the -3 building and means they'll have to spend points to get back to the better buildings... and if you try to push them there, you could reveal that that's your agent.

There's an advanced game with some cards that do stuff, but I haven't tried those yet. I'll have to see if they add value to the game or just make things more chaotic.

While both NotR and TSS are social deduction races in which you're trying to promote your color... Top Secret Spies is a quicker and slightly more family-ish. There's not nearly as much of a penalty to revealing your color, mostly that it guarantees that people will try and stop your color from winning. It hits a lot of the same notes as NotR, without taking as long or being as "gamer-y". Which is both a positive and a negative. It's definitely a game I could play with my family (which I could never do with NotR) but still works with gamers fairly well.

A good fun wholesome family game that plays 7. Really just an activity where players move pawns around with secret identities, scoring point as they go along. The advanced version allows players to guess secret identities. It is tough to guess the identities correctly unless someone deliberately reveals their pawns by constantly positioning their pawn in a good position.

Clean wholesome filler Kramer style

I don't know if I would want a version of this game with more chrome. Simple enough that I don't understand why this game has not found a foothold in the family game market. Not something I would play ever day or pay alot of cash for but, a nice enough diversion which could make to the table once and a while. Play with the "advanced" rules for maximum bliss.

Try to cross the finish without exposing your agent. With 4 players you have 6 agents. Throw the dice and move the agents. You can spread the result of your dice over as many agents as you want. When a agent goes to the house with the safe, then points are given.  If you are in the church the agent gets 0 points, in the ruin -3, the other house get the points marked on it.

Wolfgang Kramer; While this game appears to be very simple, that isn't necessarily the case. The board is a oval movement track, with points allocated to the various spaces. Seven different colored 'spies' are placed on the board. When it's a player's turn, he rolls a die and then moves any combination of characters forward that number of spaces. The newly moved spies then score points based on the their new location. However, the trick here is that each player's color isn't known until the end of the game, so players are encouraged to deduce which color belongs to whom. In addition, there are some advanced rules which allow players to score more points at the end of the game for correctly guessing everyone's identity.

Eh, my experience with Top Secret Spies was anything but quick.  Nor was it very strategic when compared with other deduction type games like Black Vienna or even the original Clue.  Maybe we were just bad players but there was hardly any subtlety involved.  To disguise your true intention, one would often move several pawns together.  However, as a scoring round approaches, it becomes obvious as people scramble to save themselves if their investigator is too far behind or happens to be in the ruins.  I suppose one could conceivably disguise himself by delibrately ignoring his own piece until the very end, since others are more likely to overlook giving points to the color that's in last place.  Even so, I doubt it is a strategy you can employ again and again.

The rules for the top secret cards were horribly written and poorly implemented.  It also took forever for the phase to resolve every single time.  I can see it being a decent game for families with children to play occasionally, albeit with the basic setup.  As for me, never again.

10/1/07:  Heimlich & Co is a really great game that probably goes under-appreciated by the denizens of this site.  We've historically used the "guess who the other players are" optional rule, which gets my recommendation.  Lastly, it's important for me to note that a very large factor in my enjoyment of this game is the mood created by the art.  If someone asked me to play "Top Secret Spies", or whatever it's called, I can see myself replying with "No", but I don't think I'd turn down a game of (the original) Heimlich & Co.

Say Anything is a great party game where each player asks a question and people have to be creative by writing an answer they think the asking player will choose over the others.  Beware that depending on who you are playing with some of the answers might be R rated. ;)

Party games are generally not my favorite, but this one is alright with the right crowd. Fun people will have fun, dull people will be rather dull. It does have party game magic: explainable in 30 seconds, involves everyone and has room for plenty of laughs. I'll recommend it when we have 6 or more people in the room.

This game is a riot of a party game, it's like apples to apples minus all the suck. With quiet people it will not be so much fun. But with a group that is extroverted, not afraid to make fools of themselves and say anything, this is the best party game out there.

Without a doubt, say anything is THE party game around here. There is no other game that comes close for wide appeal and guaranteed fun. We have literally played this at every family gathering in the past several years, from Christmas to camping. Very accessible, non-gamers find the premise original but non-threatening.

Love it.

While the game is all in good fun, you must keep the maturity of your group in mind before you play. I can play this game fine with groups of children, teenagers, adults, and elderly people. Mixing these groups, however, can often yield unsavory results. After many uses, the chits and board will begin to show many signs of wear-and-tear. It doesn't keep well. Nonetheless, the game is very entertaining and rules-light.

I played this game only three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

As someone who doesn't usually enjoy party games very much, I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this one. For its mechanisms it's surely nothing innovative and it reminds me a lot of Dixit or Wits and Wagers, but even with all that Say Anything manages somehow to be a great party game.

Its components are extremely simple and really not that impressive, but it's a game that's actually able to be fun. It's true that that fun depends largely on the people you're playing with and their creativity to come up with silly answers, but it allows at the same time all kinds of humor and therefore it's a game that basically everyone could enjoy. Someone likes the obvious kind of jokes, others the gross kind and others like the silly one. This game will be able to entertain all of them.

Finally a party game that I actually like. I admire how a simple concept like this can make such a great game for party situations. Big thumbs up!

RATING: 8
Similar to Balderdash, only better! You pick a question from a card along the impossible-to-prove opinion lines (i.e. the most overrated band of all time, the best Pizza Topping) all the other players have to write down what they think your favourite answer to the question will be. Any duplicates are eliminated and have to be rewritten, and the real clever bit is that rather than living or dying by your own response, you bet on what you think is the right answer (or at least, the questioner's favourite answer) is. To do this you have two tokens with your colour (and symbol for the colourblind) on it. You get one point for each of your tokens on the chosen answer and one for being the one who wrote the right answer down (first, since duplicates are rewritten by the last person to put them down). This means players can get a maximum of three points each. The questioner gets a point for every token on the answer he chose (obviously he did this before betting, using the hitech "selectomatic 5000") up to a maximum of three points as well. I hope you can see that this means everyone has an incentive to play the game properly. Another improvement over Balderdash is in the bits, which consist of, instead of paper and pencils, dry-wipe markers and boards, so you can use the same bits over and over again. Very neat.

Say Anything is a light-hearted game about what you and your friends think. It gives you the chance to settle questions that have been hotly debated for centuries. For instance, "What is the most overrated band of all time?" or "Which celebrity would be the most fun to hang out with for a day?" So dig deep into your heart or just come up with something witty - this is your chance to Say Anything!

RATING: 7
This is a very enjoyable game but it needs to be with the right group of friends. I have played this game with a group of friends that I know very well and see regularly and it was great fun and we played again straight away. Then on another occasion I played with one or two close friends and what essentially amounted to acquaintences (or friends of friends) and it had the opposite outcome. Only those people that actually knew one another really well had any clue how to answer the questions so it kind of fell flat.

One other comment is that it helps to play with people who have a sense of humour as often what really gets the points and makes this game so much fun is the funniest answer.

Way more fun than apples to apples with much more interaction. Has a similar style of game play but you don't have to worry about getting stuck with dumb cards because with each question you can come up with your own answer. You also get points for picking the same answer as the person whose turn it is.

The one advantage this has over Wits and Wagers is that it works in a variety of places, as the questions are less culture-specific.  If you're in North America, or have access to a localized version of Wits and Wagers, then I'd recomment that instead.  This is still a very good party game, but it depends quite strongly on the group of people playing it.

A great party game that can be learnt in 30 seconds and played by everyone. Very movie and TV focused which could be a problem for some people but it is not about trivia so everyone has a chance providing they know the people they are playing with.

Go-to game for this style of party game. Tailor-made jokes. Tests and rewards creativity. Can play this with anyone, and absolutely hilarious when played with the right people.

RATING: 6
I think the best way to play this would be with user-generated questions.  I also think that Celebrities - also user-generated - is theoretically better than Time's Up with is canned cards.  But even among creative types, there's a real value to hitting the ground running.  Maybe a Mad-Lib kind of fill in the blank thing would be a more practical ideal?  Anyway, I think this is a fine and simple family game engine, probably with more legs than Apples to Apples.  Not particularly my thing, though.  Time's Up: Title Recall is still my weapon of choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Now, this is a fun party game.  It takes the best part of Apples to Apples (the arguing) and applies it to the best part of Wits & Wagers (the betting on other people's answers) and makes a great game.  Four players seems too few for the game, and eight seems like a bit too many.  I think six would be perfect.

This is a great party game for creating some interesting conversation given the possible range of topics, and on occasion it can be extremely funny.

Party games are a tough lot.  So much depends on the players.  This game plays to that very well since the game is ultimately about the players involved.

A really enjoyable party game that gets players talking about some of the strangest things.  The strategic aspect of the game is very thin, and if you care too much about winning you will be disappointed.  This works great with non-gamers and seems to be a wonderful family game.  Non-gamers love it, and it has a decent amount of fun for gamers too.

It will probably hit the table a lot when I have larger groups.  Everyone from youth to seniors seem to have some fun with the game because of its simplicity.  It's hard to count the number of people I've played the game with that have asked where they can get their own copy.  Laughter and conversation...exactly what you want from a party game.

It's unfair to say this game is like apples to apples but you can Say Anything. Say Anything has that one tiny change that changes everything. We've laughed and enjoyed this game so much.

This is Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity with a twist. Each person is given a dry erase board and two betting markers. One play reads a question, all the other players then write what they think the best answer is on their boards. Each player then reveals what they have written on their boards and places them onto the table. The player that reads the question selects their favorite answer. The other players then get to place their betting markers on whoever has the answer they think is the winner. The writer of the chosen board gets 1 point, everyone else gets one point for each of their betting chips on the winning board.

This game is a significant upgrade from Cards Against Humanity and Apples to Apples. First off, you can set the level of horribleness yourself. In the other two you either have to go adult or child like. This leaves it up to your imagination/creativity so you can dial it in yourself. Secondly, sometimes in Cards or Apples you'll have your card read and just know it's not the winner. In this, if there is an answer way better then yours then you can still get two points by betting on the clear cut winner. No dead man walking. Thirdly, the whole problem of repetitive answers in the past games is cured because your answers are literally fill in the blanks that you get to do yourself.

This game is really way more fun then the other card games. It's like playing the card version style, but having your answer be Madlibs answers. Also, the betting feature pretty much guarantees you'll not have a runaway leader.

I think this is basically a better version of Apples to Apples.

You are trying to guess the judge's response, but you're not limited to matching adjectives to nouns, you get a wide variety of questions that might prompt interesting responses or might tell you something about your friends.

Rules are designed to be less rigid, and more to just facilitate a good party game (you get all these questions to choose from as a player, just pick the fun one...).

Lots of cards, little artifice, great party game for any group of gamers or non-gamers.

I just use Wits and Wagers components to play Say Anything.  We just make up our own questions, which seems like fun.  Not sure if Say Anything's built in questions would make the game better or not.

Not quite as good as I thought it would be.

Surprisingly I think Apples to Apples is better because it forces you to be creative with what you have. Say Anything just turned into a 'who can write down the most ridiculous thing' contest...but maybe that just says more about my group then the game :)

Marked down from 7 to 5. You really need the right group for this to be fun. With the right group it is probably the best party game out there, but with the wrong group it easily falls flat (to the point that I would almost rather be playing Cards Against Humanity). I'll still keep it in my collection but it isn't going to be my go to party game anymore.

While this could be an enjoyable party game, it usually quickly devolves into a series of adult rated answers about sex and bodily functions.  That's too bad, because on those occasions when it has stayed "G" rated (or at least "PG"), it has been much more fun.

Another big hit from Norh Star Games.  A combination of 'apples to apples', 'wits and wagers' and 'things', three frequent games at our games group.  A lot of laughter once the games gets going.  One of those games where the score doesn't really matter - it's all about the experience.  Excellent party game that can be played with any group.  The game does get a little bogged down when playing with people of radically different ages.

After reading the rules, I wasn't really expecting to like this as much as either Wits & Wagers or Apples to Apples, as I like the structure of both of those games.  I thought this game would be too wide open for my tastes.  However, I ended up really enjoying the game!  The open-ended nature allows players to play however they'd like, whether it be silly, serious, crazy, or whatever else they'd like to do.  I also like that the judge gets a choice of questions, so they can pick the question they're most interested in.  Overall, another great party game to bring out in lieu of my other shortlist of party games.

Good game for a couples game night.  We played with T&D, and W&J.  Guess who wrote the best answer to a person's question.  Can be quite racy, but you can avoid this if you are smart enough to play to the group you are playing with.  Read it well enough and know what to avoid.  We had a lot of fun with this, and I can see it coming out a lot more.  Scored higher for Heather than Wits and Wagers does.  She isn't a fan of trivia style games, but the social aspect of this game definitely pushes it up.

Wits & Wagers meets Imaginiff? This is a decent followup to W&W. That said, it is not as accessible or unique. It's fun, and very streamlined, but this game does NOT tread any sort of new ground.

RATING: 5
Being a big fan of Cluzzle and Wits and Wagers, this game was a disappointment for me. It's just a hodgepodge of other better party games. The mechanics blunt any potential discussion. Since the selector can't tip his hand as to his favorite answer, he can't really discuss them. That's my favorite part of apples to apples. Most of the questions are too straightforward and don't allow for a lot of creativity. Plus, half of the pens in mine didn't work and rest of the production seemed flimsy.

Lots of fun crammed into 20 minutes.  With the right group of people, this is one of the best out there.
I think you definitely need to spend some time discussing why you chose what you chose.  That's where all of the fun is.

I actually prefer Wits and Wagers to this one.  SA is so dependent on the group.  You can also run into the problem of some groups trying to be as funny as possible all of the time.

I never seem to do that well with party games, I always wish we were playing something more complicated. There's nothing wrong with Say Anything, but I'd rather put my creative juices towards a storytelling game like Dixit or Once Upon a Time. Besides, sometimes my brain is well attuned to wordplay and sometimes I'm spent and it's just too much pressure, especially when a timer is involved.

I find Wits and Wagers relatively painful to play.  I had hoped that things might be better with this one, but I think these games just fill a genre that is not my thing.

RATING: 6
I'm not normally the type of person who goes in for party games, but given the right crowd and the right mood I can have a good time with them and Say Anything is certainly a worthy title in the genre and reminds me a lot of the way we effectively used to play (Beyond) Balderdash, but with a much better scoring system.

One player draws a card, chooses one of the 7 questions on it, and then asks the group. The group responds as they like. The asker chooses the answer they like best secretly and the group then places their 2 betting chips on the answer or answers they think the chooser liked best. Points are scored: 1 for each correct chip, 1 for the person who wrote that answer, and up to 3 for the chooser based on how many people correctly bet which answer they would choose.

The concept is simple and the play is fast-paced. This is a fun one for the players who enjoy writing off-the-wall responses, but you can also definitely win without having a great ability to write good answers due to the betting system. It also scales pretty well at 5+, which is nice for larger groups. You could definitely play in couples or even larger teams if you really needed to go beyond the 8 that it natively scales to. The game defaults to 12 rounds, but I prefer to play once or twice around the table instead so that each person has an equal number of chances to be the chooser.

Not something that I would always be in the mood for, but with a good group and a bit of alcohol it's hard to go wrong with this one.

My family loves this game. It quickly became one of the favorites for the family, especially my two daughters. Has basically replaced Apples-to-Apples and Wits and Wagers as our go-to game for an evening of fun and laughs. Being able to respond with anything you can think of works much better than being restricted to the cards in your hands (Apples-to-Apples). Can choose to go for the best answer or the funniest answer.

Unoriginal but fun party game -- basically the same gestalt as Apples to Apples, except the judge here draws a card and picks which of the five "green-apple questions" he wants to play, and then the players all create and submit their own red apples, instead of being compelled to play cards from their (limited) hand. So a nice opportunity for more humor and creativity.

Like Wits & Wagers, what's in the box is fun, but the rules v1.0 were not well thought-through, and you can make a better game out of the parts by coming up with your own variant. 

Very popular with my children.

Say Anything has become arguably my favorite party game. If you know a lot of people who enjoy Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity, this is definitely a game you're going to want to check out. Instead of being restricted a hand of cards to choose from (and hoping that the judge will find your card the funniest), this game creates a good opportunity for creativity as you get to write your own answer to the judge's question. That aspect mixed with the fact that you get to vote on which response the judge will like the most makes the game way more re-playable and interesting, in my opinion, than the previously mentioned games.

I don't think I'm really the target demographic for this game so my comments should be taken with a grain of salt.
Its a fairly typical party game with simultaneous play by everyone, a chance for some creativity and nothing which should be taken too seriously. It does also have that slightly distasteful element (to me) of artificially "getting to know people". That is, that the question/answers are about what the questioner thinks/like/etc. I'm not against that perse, but it seems a little forced into this game.
Reasonable party game, just not for me. (I'd rather be playing something like Times Up.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The judge scores based on the number of players who correctly predict his choice, so you avoid most of the off-the-wall judging that makes Apples to Apples either so annoying or, some players believe, so charming. Still, knowing which player wrote which answer can introduce some unsavory elements into the game and make it somewhat competitive for a party game.

I rate Apples to Apples a 3. Imaginiff I hate even more and give it a 1. This game takes A2A, mixes it with Imaginiff (and sprinkles some Wits & Wagers in for good measure) and somehow, inexplicably, comes out with a GREAT party game. I love this one and would pull it out with ANYBODY, gamer or no. North Star Games' masterpiece IMO.

One of the best party games going, zips along fast, has great incentives, and can cause side-splitting laughter. Doesn't require too much intensity or thought, and people can casually join or leave, so it's pretty much perfect.

RATING: 7
It's like Apples to Apples (or CaH) but you actually get to be creative/funny rather than relying on the cards to do it for you. And you can get points even if your answer wasn't chosen. Fun party game.

RATING: 7
Another great little party game which has us in hysterics whenever it gets played. Its not too long and some of the answers we get when playing are brilliant. Only complaint is that once it has been played a few times it loses its immediate appeal and can get repetative once the cards have been used a few times. Thats why its a once or twice a year game IMO.

50% Apples To Apples, and 50% Wits & Wagers.   But for me, the experience is very much the same as A2A and less like W&W, and I really don't like that kind of party game at all.  It's a great social activity, and it requires that you play with people you know well, or else the game won't work.   I sort of see why people love it so much, but it really isn't my cup of tea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Maybe it's a limitation of the people I game with (myself included,) but we're pretty useless when it comes to coming up with answers of the top of our heads. Games tend to fall flat with us.

I'd always take Balderdash over this one. The structure of Balderdash helps you construct answers, and you're not just trying to appeal to a particular person, but to the group on the whole.

Unlike Concept [thing=33604][/thing] was a "Party" Game which was a lot of fun.   Read out a question ("Best Invention of the last century", "Worst thing to say on your first date" etc) and each player other that you writes down an answer.   You choose your favourite.  Simple and good fun.  My only criticism is that it does need some form of creativity from the players else it can be a little dull if the answers are completely unimaginative.

It's ok, But I thought it would be more funny, and some of the time it's a good response but doesn't fit the person choosing so it's a waste of a guess or you can't make the joke..Idk might be better games out there for this stuff. I'd play again though to give it a bit more chance

RATING: 7
Played once. 

My wife actually doesn't like Wits and Wagers because of the betting element. She says it's less about knowing the answers and more about betting the spread, which I suppose is true. So I was curious to see how she'd enjoy Say Anything. She enjoyed it much more, and it's certainly got a real Apples to Apples element to it. Questions seem diverse enough to stimulate good answers. A potential downside is the group-dependency, so it might go over better with family members than your Euro gaming group.

Fast. Enjoyable, will play again.

A great game for family, but falls flat when people involved aren't willing to have a bit of fun. Trying to gauge someone's favourite response from those available is fun, but I don't think there's much replay value with the same players involved.

Sort of like Wits and Wagers (same designer), but freeform. As in Apples to Apples, requires rotating judge to decide on favorite answer. Unlike A2A, answers are not anonymous so there's pressure to pick favorites. Didn't work for me.

RATING: 7
This is one of the best party game that I've played.  I haven't actually played many of them (at the time of writing this), but the first time we played this we played it three times in a row which should say something about the games quality.  I will admit though this game brings out the naughtiness in people, especially if there is alcohol involved.  Best of all, you can scale how much time it takes to play this one by adjusting how many questions you want each player to ask.  Fantastic game, and the company has excellent customer service if you happen to get some dud dry wipe markers in your copy. I like Dixit more so I got rid of this, but I still yearn for it occasionally.

RATING: 7
A solid party game.  Betting doesn't feature as much here as it does in Wits & Wagers, which I actually like; it keeps players from "betting the farm" on a single question.  It helps if you know the people you're playing with, but that's not necessary to enjoy the game.  Two of the dry erase pens in my copy were "DOA", but that's not a big deal as they're easily replaced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Much more appealing party game than things like CAH or Apples to Apples since you actually have to put thought into what you write and since it doesn't have the shock factor your responses actually have to make sense. It always bothered me in CAH when a card that made no sense or wasn't actually funny in the context of the prompt won simply because the card itself was funny independently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Takes off the Wits and Wagers engine and improves it. Now, instead of esoteric numerical values, you're betting on what you think your friends will find best. It's a really good party game for 5+ players. Also, it handles yer odd player, which a fair amount of party games cannot do. Fun game.

I only enjoy very few party game. This is not one of them because most of the categories that were chosen during our play completely eluded me. (I am not from the US and not familiar with most of the common popular culture knowledge. Also some of the words/terms that the questions were targeting are not part of my active vocabulary.) Most folks in our party seems to enjoy the game though and it went by fast.

Fantastic party game.  Apples to Apples meets Wits & Wagers.   I love party games like this, because of the social aspect, and it gets people talking about themselves, their preferences and experiences!  One player asks a question, others come up with answers, and then for points try to guess which answer the person asking the question would choose.  Best with people who do know each other.  Would like to see more questions, and with less pop culture references. See my pictorial review here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/468223

A little apples to apples, a little wits and wagers, and a little balderdash.  My favorite party game to date.  I feel a party game needs to have a lot of laughing and after reading the questions, I felt like too many of them were rather bland.  It turns out this isn't a problem, though.  People get pretty creative and even when presented with straight-edge answers, it usually triggers a discussion of the topic.  Excellent! (for a party game, meaning my rating really reflects the specific situations in which it would be in use)

Good group/party game, particularly with creative/storytelling types who can come up with fun, interesting answers. I wish the questions that came with the game were more interesting, so when we play we allow the players to come up with their own questions if they don't like any of the ones on the cards.

Scoring is a little annoying/convoluted, for a social game where people may be expected to be a bit inebriated.

Can be easily adapted to CAH white cards, and have people come up with their own answers/fill in the blanks.

Slightly better than Apples to Apples in similar "player judge" games.  Works best with groups of people who are somewhat familiar with each other.  Seems to play a bit shorter and is more even and less random (compared to A2A.)

If playing with a mix of acquaintances or strangers A2A is the right pick.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As one of the non-gamers playing with us tonight said, "This is like Apples to Apples but so much better!" She's right - it takes the "match the judge" part of A2A, adds in some free-form creativity, and tops it all off with a bit of Wits & Wagers-ish wagering... the result is a delight to play.

So far, we've got two games under our belts - the 7 player game was a lot more fun than the 5 player game... the difference, I think, between a 6 experience & an 8 experience. I think the sweet spot for this will be 6-8 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tons of fun, so far. Almost like a conversation starter in game form.
And you do not need to know all of the people playing.

UPDATE - The open-ended nature of the game is actually it's undoing. It lacks the structure of a Wits and Wagers or an Apples to Apples, and that makes it stupidly wacky in a non-sequitur way that isn't much fun.

Update (3/31/13): I bumped the rating up from a 6 to a 7 because I realized this game really depends on your group. A game full of in-jokes isn't much fun, but a game full of truly creative answers can be great. This should have been obvious, but I had to be reminded of it by a fun experience. I honestly have to say that this game is much better as an ice-breaker/getting to know you game. When players aren't trying to appease each other, the more outlandish and fun answers come out.

Read aloud a (fairly bland) question and then turn it around, make it interesting! One player reads a question and everyone else writes an answer on a card. Then, that player picks his favorite in secret and everyone votes on what they think is that player's favorite answer.
Whoever got it right gets a point.

It can be as clean or as offensive as your group wants, it's really up to the players.

Fun party game that requires creativity but doesn't put players on the spot. Some of the questions were kind of duds, others aren't really funny but serve as decent conversation starters, but most will get laughs.

Nice mix of elements from various party games (Wits and Wagers, Boxers or Briefs, Apples to Apples, Things).  It helps to be good at determining what the Selector (judge) will pick (I am not), but having that secondary opportunity to vote for the final answer means it doesn't matter that your answer was lame (mine always are) like in Apples to Apples.  Becoming well liked in my gaming group.

This game is a cross between Apples-to-Apples and Balderdash with a bit more back-bone. Overall, it's a good party game which benefits from a simple structure and a solid scoring system. However, with Dixit also being in the creative jamming and collective voting/judging category, it somewhat pales in comparison. This is not that it is a bad game in any way, simply that I'd rather be playing Dixit. In its defense, the components that come in the box (e,g., dry-erase markers and boards) are top-notch.

Reasonably fun for a party game. Largely vacuous in that you don't actually have to know anything, just anticipate which suggested answer the "decider" with choose. Doesn't seem to have as much potential for truly hilarious and memorable situations as some other party games.

Say Anything is a fantastic game to play with family and close friends. Since players make the answers every time, it definitely has a longevity that Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity just doesn't. Also, the scoring system makes a lot of sense even though most people just want to have fun. My main complaint about Say Anything is that it just works so much better with groups who know each other well. Maybe it would work well with groups who don't know each other at all, but it doesn't seem to work as well in the in-between situation. Couples and close friends will have extreme advantages over acquaintances. This makes the game super fun when everyone's on similar footing, but I'd probably rather play the formerly mentioned games with casual friends to avoid too many inside jokes and "unfair" answers.

Bought this after winning some promo bucks at GenCon. Fun party game. I would describe this as Apples to Apples meets Wits and Wagers. Plays fast and can be really fun with the right group. You really need at least 5+ to make it work. The game has one weakness: if you play with someone who puts answers down they think the moderator would put down themselves because they know them well, that is an immediate fun-killer. Encourage people to answer for themselves and you have a good party game.

Recipe:

Take Dixit
Add cards that remind you of Pictionary, Balderdash, trivial persuit
Add awkwardness that means you actually have to know (and probably like) the people you're playing with
Remove the sensible scoring system in Dixit and replace with one which gives no reward for good answers
Bake for 45 minutes and you may get one or two laughs

Even as a party game it's crap. The white boards are the only half decent thing about the game

This is a very good, hysterically funny party game for up to 8 players. Mind you, check your sensibilities at the door, as people who are easily offended may squash the fun factor. With the right mix of people, it can be the best laughs you have all night. It requires a bit of creativity in the writing department, but beyond that, it's up there with Eat Poop You Cat!

An infinitely better version of Apples to Apples, and in a sense, Cards Against Humanity. Can be as family-friendly or "dirty" or just outright silly, as you want depending on who you're playing with, which is one of Say Anything's major strengths.

Even with 5 questions per card, I can see it running it's course(after a long time) after seeing similar questions after many plays. This can be simply remedied with an expansion or heck even writing your own questions. I'm sure people on BGG have already posted some files one can use to add more replayability to your game.

RATING: 5
This is a great game for outgoing people who enjoy spending social time with their friends, laughing, and arguing lightheartedly about trivial matters. In other words, the opposite of me.

It's a good game and I want to give it its due; I think the problem here is with me rather than with the game.  I am rather shy and often dislike expressing or committing to opinions, and I am not good at performing on demand.  So, this is a perfect game for its target audience. I'm just not part of that audience.

EDIT: Every time I play this game I am convinced that the next time, it won't be fun.  I have tried playing with people I know and have less trouble putting down answers, but on the other hand it seems like a great opportunity to get into a fight. Eh.  I've laughed while playing it but I have this sort of distaste for it that it probably doesn't deserve.

This is the perfect party game. Phrase matching games such as Apples to Apples (which is fun up to a point) are rendered obsolete thanks to this gem. The best part of this game is the freedom to be as creative (or not) as one wishes in their answers. Being hamstrung by drawing bad cards will never be a dilemma, and the game caters itself to any group and any individual play style. You like shock humor a la Cards Against Humanity? Write down your own holocaust jokes! You like tailoring your answers unfairly to the judge's personal bias because you know them better than anyone else? ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE! Do you like non sequitur humor? MONKEY PINEAPPLE. 

I've never had a bad game of Say Anything, and I've played it in very different groups almost every time.

While I found Wits and Wagers neither fish nor foul (too heavy for closer fun, too light to be played as a game), I think Say Anything is a real winner.  

Its got the charm of Apples to Apples with just a drop or two more elements of game.  It hits the party game genre at just about the level I want it to.

RATING: 7.5
Like most party games, VERY group dependant.  After looking at some of the questions before playing I took Morgan D’s suggestion and spun it off somewhat.  What we did was hand everyone 2 cards, and let them choose a question from those two cards OR just make up their own question, their choice.  

Well in our two games with this variant, we had some very good answers come out from card questions AND made up questions so this worked out really well and we had some good laughs.

VERY easy to teach, and just a lot of fun if playing with the right group. Of course, the dirtiest answers were the ones getting the most laughs, so again with the wrong group and a bunch of boring answers, the game could be much less enjoyable, this was not the case at all with our group.  We played with 2 non-gaming couples who have played Time’s Up and Telestrations before and they seemed to like this just as much, and a couple of them commented the next day how sore their Stomach’s were from laughing.  I thought the betting aspect (tweaked from W&W) was well done, its very light and just adds just enough interest to the actual game, of course its not needed if you don’t want it, just nice if you do. 

Would like to see a card expansion with some more interesting questions. My rating likely would likely be a full point lower without the "creativity variant".

Say Anything is a fun party game with the right crowd - namely one that loves making jokes and silly musings. In kind of group, this game is an absolute riot.

On top of that, the point scoring system is actually very well put-together. It's one of the rare games that emphasizes players having a good time that might actually get a bit competitive.

Be warned that it could fall flat with a more serious group (it has happened to me). Otherwise, this game is a strong party game recommendation.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2011)

Say anything is a good party game. Still many times I don’t want to play it so I’m downgrading its rating accordingly. I want to play it from time to time.

I have to recognize it is the perfect game to play with non-gamers and family (easy rules, short playtime, lots of fun). It is very easy to explain and it always makes us laugh every time. It can also handle 8 players without adding much playtime or downtime but I think it is best with 6 players. Very group dependent.

It’s been awhile since I last played it. I will try to correct this and then I will come back and re-comment

This is a very fun party game where you get to write your own answers to Judge's questions - this brings out so much creative answers from your friends, and much laughter would ensue.

But as with most party games, you have to enter this with the right mind set. Some people may find awkward to play this where they just cannot think of funny things to write down and feel left out. So, the judges will have to be careful choosing the question where everyone in your group will get it.

Very simple, yet fun. If only pens were working, it would have been my friends' number one party game to play.

I can't honestly tell if the game is good.  What I mean to say is, I enjoyed myself (the whole group did) but, I think it was just because we were enjoying each others' company.  There's not a lot of game here but, it's still fun.  Of course, most games can be measured by the people you play with.  I'm sorta wishy-washy on my definition, I suppose.  So again, I enjoyed it but, I don't know if the game is good.

I'm not a party game sort of guy, but within that framework this is fine. I prefer trivia games, and would choose Wits & Wagers over this. Basically, this is Apple to Apples with open ended answers. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun party game. Players take turns being 'judge' for a turn; the judge will read a question regarding the judge's movie preferences, favorite car etc... and the rest of the players will all write their best guess. Once all have writing their answer, the judge will secretly make his pick, and the players will each cast their vote on which answer they think the judge picked. If they are right, they get points. 
The concept is great, and if you have the right group of people, it can be great fun. It does seem like the cards with the questions become repetitive after a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Perfect party game to play with people you know well, gamers or not. The questions provide plenty of opportunities for stupid answers, joking, bringing people out of their shells. Like wits and wagers, it is great for casual play, and also playing tactically by playing the scoring system to your advantage. Highly recommended.

A surprisingly fun little party game.  Not being a fan of Apples to Apples, I was a little wary at first, but the betting portion (borrowed from Wits & Wagers) improves the problem of not really having anything to do after having provided your answer, greatly improving the game.  It seems like Say Anything also does a good job at adapting itself to both the players and mood, suited for both a "getting to know you" hug session as well as general goofiness.

For a party game, it's pretty darn fun.  I hesitated to give it a ten only because so far I haven't given one out, but it is a great party game. Easy to learn, fun to play and quick.  Even with strangers it's not bad.  

Only issue?  Had quite a few duds of the dry erase markers that came with it.  Thankfully someone had a copy of wits and wagers and had some good ones that came with that.  (Notice that I decided not to factor that into the score, the game mechanic itself is great.  I'll just have to go get some fine-tip dry erase markers.  Been meaning to do that anyhow for some other games.)

After playing this a few more time I have to say it needs more than 8 players. I'm tempted to try to get some dry erase boards and make a version that goes to 12 or 14.  Otherwise teams/couples can work, but I'd suggest having only one person ask the question/judge in the "team" but they can collaborate on answers.

The description that best captures this game is "the love child of Apples to Apples and Wits & Wagers".  You've got the element of trying to play to the likes and dislikes of the judge for the turn, but also a well-balanced, double-blind scoring system (the hallmark of North Star games) as well.  And then on top of that, you also have the ability to impress the judge with your creativity and humor (which reminds me a little of Balderdash).  It is incredibly fun, and I was impressed by the range of questions that you could ask, which went from rather cerebral opinion questions all the way to absolute sillyness (such as "What would be the best thing to teach a monkey to do?").  I can see this being a big hit in whatever group plays it!

The scoring system for Say Anything seems to even the game out way too much.  We had a four way tie for first place in our game.  In a mixed group, gamers/non-gamers not a single person wanted to play it again.  Even had the comment that the game wasn't very good and compared to Wits & Wagers (which most of these people had played) it wasn't.

Markers also did not work out of the box, same as what happened with Wits and Wagers.  Northstar needs to make the markers higher quality.

Fun party game that can be used as an icebreaker to get to know more about your fellow board gamers. Game is easy to learn and plays fairly quickly. Good laughs can be had from this one.

RATING: 9
Party game where a judge chooses a statement from a card (something like "Who's the most underrated actor?") and the players rush to write in their choices.  The trick is that you're trying to guess the answer that the judge would pick.  After all the write-in votes are cast, each player gets to place bets on which one the judge will choose.  Points are tallied for correct guesses and/or being the person who wrote the correct answer.  

Pros:  Fast-paced and humorous.  Hard to go wrong with a game where the answer is revealed using something called the "Select-o-matic 5000"

Cons:  Spouses have an advantage.  A minor problem, really.  This game is so simple, there's very little to complain about.

Say Anything is a light-hearted game about what you and your friends think. It gives you the chance to settle questions that have been hotly debated for centuries. For instance, "What is the most overrated band of all time?" or "Which celebrity would be the most fun to hang out with for a day?" So dig deep into your heart or just come up with something witty - this is your chance to Say Anything!

RATING: 6
Solid, enjoyable party game from the makers of Wits & Wagers.  Make sure to play the game for fun and leave strategy behind as it can impede game play when "selecting" your favorite answer (basically, whomever you select will earn at least one point, maybe more if they put one of their chips on their own answer because they think you will select it).

RATING: 5.5
Light party game in the Apples to Apples tradition of trying to come up with answers to appeal to the judge.  As with all games of this sort, it can be a lot of laughs with the right crowd.  In terms of game design though, this is no Wits and Wagers.

This is my favorite "how well do you know each other" party game. I can play it with friends and family without getting weirded out by TMI. Plus, it usually leads to a good story with at least one of the answers (did you know that Kristen is weird about people using the backdoor?)

In this game, one person is the round leader, and everyone else focuses on them. A question is asked, and each other player writes down how they think the main player would answer that question. Then, everyone reveals, and the main player picks the answer they like best secretly. Finally, everyone bets on which answer they think the person picked and points are assigned by how right you were.

RATING: 9.5
Type: 3-8 player light party game where players provide open-ended responses written on a small tablet, and then try to guess which one the lead player will prefer.

Best with: 4-8
Weight: Light
Duration: 45-60 minutes
Group Notes:
Game is as raunchy or clean as the players choosing answers.
Very little chance of fixing the scores or screwing someone, unlike other party games like CAH.
Does require open-ended answers, so someone who is out of it or not very creative may struggle

Say Anything is a party game where one player asks a question, the other players provide answers, and then they try to predict which answer the asking player will pick. Points accrue until a winner emerges.

This is a fun game that you can play with friends and family, either those you know really well, or even those you've just met and are getting to know in front of this game.

One nice thing about this game is the huge variety of cards and questions that can be asked, providing nearly limitless replayability over time. The game really is limited only by the creativity and humor of the players. Get a good group that has a good collective sense of humor, and you have a really fun evening ahead.

One potential downside is the need to have at least 4 players to make this game worth setting up. Anything less than 4 players, and you just don't have enough options to choose from to make things interesting. I'd say the sweet spot is to have 4-6 players before things drag down. Still, you can probably go even higher and be just fine.

This game is excellent, and if I'm ever in a group that wants to play some games, but not in a mood or group make-up to break out heavier games, Say Anything is a go-to game for me.

Similar games in my collection: I really don't have anything else in my collection that gets close to the level of varied fun in a group setting for a light game.

If you had told me what my new games of December would be, I would not have predicted my favorite of them would be Say Anything. No knock on the game, but I am not usually a party game fan and when playing a party game, I like a little more ability to play a game rather than have a laugh - I expect that part to come out anyway. But we played this with another couple and had an absolute blast - if you have ever played Apples to Apples and thought it was barely a game then Say Anything might appeal. A similar way of scoring really - if your answer gets picked you score - but also the other players get to bet on which answer will be picked so they can score too. Plus (and this is a big part of it for me) the answer you give is limited only by imagination and quick-wittedness, not the random deal of cards you are dealt. Big laughs, good game.

Good party game, one player chooses a topic, then everyone else has to write down what they think that player's opinion of that topic is (e.g. favourite cartoon). Then the one player secretly chooses the one he likes the best, and the other have to bet on which one he will choose. Great fun with the right crowd, requires a bit of creativity, lateral thinking and humour.

RATING: 7
Apples to Apples with just the right amount of added depth, and Wits & Wagers without the runaway leader issue (as the number of points you can earn is capped).

Say Anything is near the top of my party game list. I still prefer W&W, and I definitely prefer Time's Up! Deluxe (and in the right mood, Pass the Bomb). But it's an all-around fun game, with plenty of appeal.

The markers it comes with are wretched; they only last a couple of months sitting in the box.

As much as I hate this expression, it really does depend on your group. Some folks just aren't creative enough to make it interesting and enjoyable. However, as this has been a rare experience for me personally, I call this one a hit. It is normally a great way to spend a half hour.

My house rule? Make up your own questions! "What is Taylor Swift's deal?" "What's the worst thing Dad does during board games?" "Who would be voted off first if our board game group was on Survivor?"

The little brother of Wits and Wagers.  I like this game, but it isn't as good as Telestrations, Wits and Wagers or Codenames so it never comes out.

The scoring mechanic is a little weird.  Also, a game should be two rounds (everyone is the "judger" twice) and not limited to 12 rounds.  I always play two rounds, but the scorecard they provide only goes 12 rounds.

This would also benefit from more interesting questions.  Some are great, but most are boring.

RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell:  Each round a "judge" asks a question, players write in ANY answer, judge secretly picks the best answer, players place bets, and the answer is revealed in order to pay out points.

Played as:  6,7,8 players

Pros:  Possibly the best mechanics of any party game I’ve ever played. Simple, effective, appropriate, with no bloat. Keeps the focus on the players rather than the game. Can be full of laughs, fun discussion, with a dash of mind reading.

Cons:  Takes a certain amount of creativity to make the game work. Don't believe me? Play a game with creative people then a second game with those who aren't. The questions seemingly try to cover a broad range of what might interest different people, this means that you may only find one or two questions on any card that appeal to your group. After enough plays, the good questions will likely repeat themselves or you'll need to ask the "lame" questions to mix it up. Or...

Other:  After a while, I started making up my own questions. Now I encourage others to do the same and use the cards as a backup if the brain-well runs dry. I didn’t think the game worked as well with more than 6 players as it either limits people to one question (per the rules) or people will most likely feel compelled to fill in the scoreboard resulting in some people getting to ask an extra question (an advantage due to points more easily gained as the judge).

Best Use: The best pure party game that will appeal to gamers.

A popular pickup game in my old FLGS when we had visitors who defined themselves as "non-gamers." I would often run games of this to help break the ice. This game is particularly good for that but lacks replay value and strategy. It's a nice party game and helps people socialize a bit, just not something I'd play given the choice. (My new favorite ice breaker for non-gamers is Fluxx)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A nice and simple party game, where the active player chooses a question from a card and the others give answers according to what they think applies to the active player. You write your answer on a speech bubble, so you are free to write anything you like, the answers are laid out in the open, so everyone knows who gave which answer. The active player secretly chooses their favourite and people vote on which they think it is and score accordingly.

I like it just fine, though I'm a bit tired of it now. I will play occasionally, but mostly when someone else really wants to.

RATING: 7
A fun game (caveat: with the right crowd).   It's has questions similar to Apples to Apples but the questioner can pick which one s/he likes best.  Players write their answers on individual white boards and keep them hidden.  The questioner then uses a dial to choose the answer s/he liked best, reads the answers and places them on the table.  Similar to Wits & Wagers everyone has two poker chips and can now bet on which question(s) they think will be picked by the questioner.  The questioner reveals the answer and players receive a point for each of their poker chips on the correctly submitted answer.  The questioner gets points for the other player's poker chips on that answer (up to 3).  

With certain groups the answers can be quite creative, nasty and or funny.  Usually the funniest answer was chosen.  I don't think the game would be that fun if the other players didn't share your sense of humor.

I enjoy this game a lot. The point system is interesting, but honestly, I play this game without the point system, with a large group of friends and we're rather....dirty in our humor. So, while the rules and point system make sense, playing without them is just as fun. Also, the boards are too small and the white board markers tend to suck. My only complaint, really. So my friends and I just bought a bunch of cheap whiteboards and our own white board markers and everything was fine.

I just don't believe in games that basically invite judgemental attitudes to the board. It is a "Dixit-looking" game and like Dixit, you sit around the table and choose an answer hoping to both choose the main players answer and get other people to choose yours. 

I just don't understand why people warn against games that encourages lying but praise games where everybody can sit around and hurt each other with bad comments on your choices of answer.

Maybe some of you, like me, once played role playing games in the 80s, and you know that every single game you'd buy had the obligatory "What is a role playing game?" chapter.  As if someone who had never played a role-playing game would just randomly pick up Star Frontiers off the shelf and start playing.  Well, I suppose it happened, but not too often.  So Dominic and the gang have revived this tradition by including a "What is a Designer Game?" explanation inside the box.  I guess they figure when this game hits Target (you know it will) maybe it'll direct the Monopoly and Life crowd to head down to the FLGS or Boardgame Geek or whatever and discover this world of games.  More power to them, I hope it works.  Oh, and by the way, this is a pretty good game.

The Cards Against Humanity killer for sure - the fact that it is a custom, create your own answer to questions really makes this game near infinite replayability.

The components are OK quality, as the question cards are a bit flimsy and as an avid sleeper, are difficult to find something suitable to fit them.

RATING: N/A
Say Anything is what Cards Against Humanity could have been.  CAH is limited in audience and forces you down a certain road in the types of answers you need to give to score points.  Say Anything is better at least to me in that it can be accessible to wide variety of audiences with different thresholds as to what they will tolerate in terms of taste.  Plus, it lets you be creative in your answers rather than limiting you to a hand of cards.

I just bought this game and have only played it with 3 players. I know it plays up to 8 and I expected a weaker game and yet it was still fun, fast-paced, accessible and interesting with 3. Games like these tend to get better with more players: think balderdash or telestrations in terms of light fun party games of that nature. More players don't slow down the game so if anything I thought this one would suffer with less but it was still great. I can't wait to try it with even more players. It seems like it has the fast paced fun of telestrations that has everyone involved each turn along with the writing aspect of balderdash and some elements of imaginiff but all stripped down to their bare bones and very distilled. A very pure and crisp party game.

At first, I thought you would give your best answer. So the guessers would have to guess the best answer for the answerer. But the answerer is trying to get the most points, so might not give an honest answer. So the guessers have to guess what the answerer will say, not what the answerer believes. 

I haven't played it yet, but it sounds like a second-guessing mind game. Hopefully it will be fun.

RATING: 7
This party game can really shine under the right circumstances.  If you have creative and engaged players, having people come up with their own answers to somewhat personal questions about the judge can be both fun and hilarious.  However, less creative people will struggle to come up with good answers, making them feel less included in the game, even if they can get points.  And some players will just pick the zaniest or most obscene (etc.) answer no matter the question, which is less fun that it sounds.  Revealing answers before everyone comes up with their own does lead to some one-upsmanship, which yields less variety in answers.

RATING: 5
I don't generally like party games, but I see Say Anything's appeal as a simple, quick, social and open party activity.

The problem is that it plays best with a group of people who know each other well, and are comfortable enough to be creative and witty and open with each other.

And with that group of people I'd rather do something else.

A party game I'd want to play as an ice breaker at a party with a bunch of people who don't know each other yet, who aren't gamers and who might not be completely comfortable yet. Although it does have that 'get to know each other' element, I feel Say Anthing relies too much on the players' input to be the right game for that situation. The questions are pretty boring and it requires the players' effort to make the answers interesting and fun.

So, not a bad game, possibly even a very good party game, but there's no situation in my life where I'd want to have this.

RATING: 6
13+ (10+) 3-8 (6-8) , 30min

A recent play has revealed issues compared to other party games so I've knocked Say Anything down a notch.

It requires several elements to evoke the fun, the main factor being familiarity with the "history" of the players involved: if you want to win you need this knowledge of the judge to get the vote; likewise you need this background to milk it for the laughs. 

However, the last statement isn't always the case, as some comedy is achieved by being crude, creative or resoureful (with coincidental answers not allowed), as well as talking your answers up, so the game is dependent on coming up with the material so not ideal game if you're having an "off" moment.

But even if familiarity, creativity and resourcefulness  are present, it requires the judge to pick a suitable question to get the best out of these factors.

Obviously the flaws rest with the players but I prefer party designs that can still overide shortfalls (i.e Title Recall, Pit), so Say Anything with the variables mentioned- coupled with chaotic chip placement and what initiallly feels like a less than straight forward scoring method- means I can't use it as an icebreaker (like Apples to Apples or Gambit 7). 

One by-product from playing that I really enjoy are the  the opinions and feelings the questions and answers provoke.

Otherwise the visitors/new people won't score any points.

Like most party games - you have to be in the mood and with the right group. It is a experience game - ie not so much to play but to have some fun socializing and making amusing commentary - and has to be approached in that vein. Fortunately most of the questions fall into light fun category.

It seems like a more free-form version of Apples to Apples with the judging component.

Fine little twist on Balderdash/Apples to Apples.  Some interesting questions and the players have to come up with answers for the judge to measure.  Very good. Update: upon further review, this game suffers from two fatal flaws of Apples to Apples.  1) Know Thy Judge.  The judge can screw everyone over by simply selecting something unrelated to their true desires.  It's worse in this game, because the judge can play the system and say, "I know green is ahead, so I won't pick his answer regardless." and 2) People like to throw in silly answers for the "humor" (if you can call it that) effect.  Too bad these two drawbacks can't be eliminated.

Almost as funny and interesting as party games yet. This is more of a get-to-know / partygame that is good for groups of friends and schools etc. (or maybe even dates) but it is great fun and creates a hilarious atmosphere when played with the right people who are into it and have the right sense of humour. Not much of a game in here in terms of mechanic but a simple idea that brings people together around a table and makes them laugh with each other.

Thanks, Dominic! This is goofy fun, and the gameplay is similar to Dixit and Wise or Otherwise. I see these games more as activities and don't really care about the scoring. Like the game show Whose Line Is It Anyway, the points don't really matter. There were a few questions where the answers got us all to laugh, and for me that's the fun of this, to share things and laugh at our own silliness.

Not quite the "god" party game I expected it to be after extensive research and TableTop, but is still pretty darn enjoyable. This game shines with 5-7, and has a lot more sexual suggestions than I expected. I remember playing with family friends and my Uncle erasing his answer after some thought because it was too inappropriate :)

Gameplay feels like a conversation starter and filer-esque, which I guess it is. The "game" in this is not very strong, and if you treat it like a cutthroat game, which people have done in the past, you're not gonna have a good time.

Wonderful little party game. Very simple rules and everyone gets their own dry erase board to write on!!!!

Encourages creativity (not my strong suit but I enjoy it nonetheless) and can cause a lot of laughs and silly arguments.

My only problem with the game is that the scoring system does not seem intuitive. Sometimes players would think they had scored when they really hadn't. Would make for some sad faces.

Also, it seemed like the judge would score 3 points every round.

Light-hearted party game where a players asks a question and everyone else has a whiteboard to write down their answer. The player chooses their favorite response and points are given out accordingly. It's simple and a familiar mechanic found in most party games but instead of choosing from cards in hand you can, well, say anything. The markers do not last long so they will need replacing after just a few games. Best if played with people you know pretty well or at least familiar with everyone as inside jokes may sway an answer (if you care about scoring). Decent replayability; when cards get drawn multiple times simply choose a different question. Can play up to eight and anything over five is a good player count.

Players: 3-8
Time: 30-40 minutes

Players take turns reading questions like "What is the best TV comedy of all time?" The other players write down the answer they think the reader will choose. The reader secretly chooses the best answer. The others choose which answer they think the reader chose. The game is more for fun, than competition, but unlike some party games, the final scores seem to be earned fairly.

This a social party game that is like a combo of wits and wagers and apples to apples.  Good laughs with the right group.  However, it is a little limiting in that you need a group that all knows each other or as an ice breakers for a group that knows little of each other.  Not a lot of middle ground there.

We enjoy Say Anything but in many cases the questions can lead humorous answers to slide towards less tasteful responses especially among adults. The Family version eliminates that.

RATING: 6
The game mechanics work smoothly and the simpleness is inviting to even the grouchiest of party guests. My problem is that the many of the questions are too silly or obvious. A possible variant is to have guests write their own questions, then tossed them into a hat (if you get your own question, you toss it back).

Another great fast lightweight party game from Northstar.

I was able to play this with a mix group of people in both age and background and it went over very well. Super simple to teach that even non gamers can get the hang of it rather quickly.

If your looking for a game that supports 8 people well and is fun to play, this is a good bet.

12.15.13 This game supports up to 8 which is hard to find. A good middle weight game that works well with a mixed group. What I said above still stands true.

RATING: 4
Combines Apples to Apples with Wits & Wagers, but the combination isn't nearly as enjoyable as either of the source games. With Wits & Wagers, even if you have no idea you can still write down a random number fairly quickly and the catch up element of the last turn makes for a lot of fun. Apples to Apples provides immediate answers that are often hilarious... but always in reasonable time. 

In the Say Anything sessions I've played, there seems to be a lot of down time due to people racking their brains to come up with something clever or trying to remember the name of that one person or trying to write an essay to describe something they can't think of the actual name for. Quick witted and funny people are a must for this game to work- neither of which are required for Wits & Wagers or Apples to Apples- and if one person isn't having fun it drags the whole game down.

With the right crowd, this game could be a lot of fun. However, it seems to require the "right" group more than either Wits & Wagers or Apples to Apples and the down time can suck all the fun out of it.

For my money, there are two types of party games: those that are actually competitive (like Werewolf or Time's Up) and those that are just for goofy fun. Say Anything might be one of the best goofy party games ever created. Every group will end up with a different game, and that makes for some really hilarious sessions. This is one game that could end up being an Apples to Apples-style hit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Vaguely like Apples-to-Apples except you get to write whatever you want instead of having a set of cards.  I was unimpressed.  The questions were mostly lame and the answers were too open-ended, so people would sit there thinking for a long time, and the rule in the book that you can't duplicate someone else's answer was annoying, because that happened a lot.  Restrictions breed creativity, and having to pick from a set of suboptimal answers is what makes this sort of game fast and fun.

Got this as part of a combo deal with Evolution in the latter's first kickstarter campaign. I had heard people calling it a great alternative to CAH, but it kinda flopped with my group.

Great family game, ideal for creative people or for those who like to write funny things for everyone to have a pleasant time. It looks like [i]Wits & Wagers[/i], but plays completely different. [i]Wits & Wagers[/i] is more serious, [i]Say Anything[/i] is sillier and funnier, so it fits better in family and friend reunions. Besides, it works perfectly as a social lubricant, as Scott Nicholson once said, and helps to know better those who are around you.

Played once with 4P. I'm not a fan of of games where one player arbitrarily judges which answer is best. There are just too many opportunities for players to weasel their way out of satisfactorily explaining their choice of answer. I guess this game helps you get to know the other players better, but that's kind of what conversations are for anyway. 

This isn't a game I'd play with people I barely know, but it works decently with a group you're familiar with. I like the clean betting system, although it was better implemented in [thing=20100][/thing].

Say Anything is a party game that plays like Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity, but players get to write their own answers instead. As opposed to Wits and Wagers, I find that this game works better with a more intimate group; it definitely helps if you know the people you are playing with and what their tastes are. Overall, it's a pretty fun game and I definitely prefer to dreck like Cards Against Humanity.

"Most overrated hip-hop band?". "Best soap opera from the 80s?". "Most fun sport to watch on TV?". Well how about "One of the worst party games I've ever played?". My answer is "Say Anything" and my fellow gamers vote in agreement. What a flop this one was. I love party games in general and was eager to try it out, only to be disappointed by the bland, boring and extremely US-centric questions (sports, TV and pop culture), which simply don't lend themselves to any creative answers for anyone outside the US and with half a brain. Although the game allows each player to pick any question from a list of six on each card to ask the crowd, we constantly found ourselves tossing away the cards, since NONE of those questions were worth asking. With a bland list of questions, you are bound to get a bland group of answers and a miserable way to spend time. The annoying downtime waiting for the last player to scribble his answer and the arbitrary scoring only added insult to injury. I can't wait to get rid of my copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
If you like Apples to Apples and Wits and Wagers, then you will have already played most of this game.  

As a base system it is fine, but my real beef with the game is that the questions are uninteresting.  Some stuff was so specific that it just made for some really boring answers or so general that answers felt arbitrary.  Too many TV questions and questions about pop culture.  There are too many times where we had to explain our answers, it bogged the game down.

We had to resort to dick jokes just to liven the thing up.

Honestly, just throw away the cards and make up your own question on your turn. With this change, the game would be much more intriguing.

This was a fun party game.  Your goal is to give an answer to a question that one player will choose, and then predict which answer the player will actually choose.  The game is as naughty or nice as you want to make it.  It's easy to teach it, but gave a lot of fun with a few rules.  Unlike Wits and Wagers, you do need to know the people you are playing with to really enjoy the game, as you are trying to predict what someone will say.  A solid party game.

It's like free-form Apples to Apples / Wits and Wagers. Rules have already been uploaded here, but in brief: one player (the judge) picks a question/theme from a card, then everyone else races to write a response on their dry-erase boards. Then, the judge uses a selector to secretly select one of the responses. Finally, players place their 2 betting chips on the answer(s) they think the judge will pick. Award 1 VP to the player whose answer was chosen, to each betting chip on the chosen answer, and 1VP/chip on the answer to the judge (max 3VP). Rotate the Judge-ship, and play once around ... most VP wins.

If you like AtA/WaW, this should be a lot of fun for you. Like Attribute, the open-endedness of responses means that at least some groups will move towards the more risque (or downright filthy!) end. Which may, of course, be a good thing depending on your group! But this seems to be another game best played with people you already know well, and I'm a bit weary of Apples to Apples anyway.

One of the better party style games I have played in a while.  Ranks up there with Why Did The Chicken? and Wits and Wagers.  It is a fun combination of the latter and Apples To Apples, perhaps because of the interesting questions the judge gets to choose from.  I wish it offered more deeper, thought-provoking questions.  Maybe they can release a "deep thoughts" expansion :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like this party game with a larger group of friends.  Every round the reader reads a question, the other players all write down an answer, and then the players bet on which answer they think the reader will choose as his favorite.

I like this so much because it is a game of "how well do you know your friends" and even if you can't think of the answer during the first phase of a turn you have the opportunity to still bet on the right answer after.  And if you don't know your friends that well this is a great opportunity to learn more about them.  Which also makes this a great ice-breaker game.

Playing with people you do know really well though can turn this game stale.  With really good friends it is common to see 3+ copies of the same answer pop up.

Soured by a few bad plays of this game. Had people join in and play with a group of people that they don't know and keep picking questions that are more suited for people who know them better (eg: "What do you think I ________?"). Also all the collusion and politics that come with people who REALLY want to win at the game just suck all the fun out of it. Still better than Cards Against Humanity/Apples to Apples.

Edit: Took out all the cards that have questions with personal pronouns on them (I, etc.). I decided that I'm not even going to give people the option to make games awkward with that nonsense, especially since I generally bring this out with people who don't know each other that well.

Anything?  Fine, I'll say it - there are better party games out there.  Not that this one is that bad.  I mean, it DOES give me the opportunity to say "anything"!  And I am certainly partial to the party games that allow me to do a bit of creative writing, such as "Beyond Balderdash", "Quip It!", "Why Did the Chicken...?", etc.  At least with this game, if you're not so good at this sort of improvisational writing, you can still earn points with the betting aspect.  That being said, I like the betting system of "Wits & Wagers" better, and I've never even played that game (which is hardly fair).  So this is definitely a big step above "Apples to Apples", but it would certainly not be my first choice in a party pinch.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6.5/10

Nice party game where you can literally think and write  any answer you think is best to a given question. Then after seeing all people's responses you must guess which of them best fits the active player.

Very nice if the group is funny and creative.

One of my favourite party games.  Surprised this isnt more popular, as it supports up to 8 players, is easy to learn, and the results are hilarious.  Player One reads a card and the rest write answers to what they think Player One will choose.  Player One then secretly selects what he thinks is the best answer.  They everyone else has two tokens to vote the answer they think Player One chose. (So it doesnt matter what you wrote, but how you vote.)  Highly recommended.

RATING: 5
Just like Apples to Apples in that it's a "play the judge" game.  Who cares if your answer is right by group consensus, just play what the judge will like.  It's a bit flawed in that regard.  Also, the scoring mechanics are a bit convoluted and not as straightforward as A2A.

Dom is a great guy, but this isn't one I want to play again.

Great party game. Read over the rules: if you like them, you'll like the game. It has a good mix of humor and discovery, but I keep the rating at 7 because, like many party games, a success depends upon the cooperation of most people at the table. (Technically, this is true of most every game, but most games never get shared with NGFs--who are far more likely to consent to playing a game for social reasons without actually willing to cooperate.)

On the face of it this is just a 'typical party game', hilarious but just an activity devoid of depth. But I see a lot more here than just a Cards Against Humanity re-skin. It promotes insightful thinking, conversation and a means to communicate with and learn from one another. It's funny, prompting humour, tricky choices and discussion but without pigeon holing players into specific choices and topics of conversation. It's easy to learn and teach and great with people you know well as well as new acquaintances (also a great way to slowly push boundaries and break the ice!) 

For me this is a go to party game that will continue to see play.

The guess-and-bid mechanism (and components!) of Wits and Wagers has been recycled into a party game via Say Anything, and the results are okay.

In order for this game to be as enjoyable as it should be, you have to have one of two groups:

1.  Everyone playing is loud and tends toward strong persuasion of the often ridiculous.

or

2.  Everyone is in the same basic age group.  I have never felt so alienated from people that were only 15 years younger than me than playing this game.  Because most of the questions involve culture, the eras that players are from come through clearly during the game.

It is a tremendous party game though.  I have loved playing it so far, and really enjoy it as much if not more than Wits and Wagers.

I need to play this more, but I think for me it suffers from my having high expectations.  Plus, that same old song - it depends on who you play with.  I think it is especially true for party games.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 3

It's fun, but I expected more. Some of the questions and answers were too basic and obvious. I think with the right group, it would be better.

Far better than Wits and Wagers and a party game that I'm willing to break out at nearly any time. It's also nice to have a game that can be played with multiple groups of people -- unlike CAH, this is totally appropriate for church youth groups (and actually has been one of my biggest hits) -- while, yeah, it definitely can work with a more risque crowd. One of the best activities for a group of people who you like/think you want to like.

By the makers of Wits & Wagers, this is maybe my favorite party game. This is like the popular Apples to Apples game except a much better version, so much so that I would never play Apples to Apples again if this game were also on hand to play. One player, the judge, is asked a question; all the other players write down what they think is the best answer. The judge secretly decides the best answer, then everyone places betting chips on which answer they think the judge picked (they can choose their own answer or someone else's). Always a lot of fun.

RATING: 5
One of the things I like about the party games that I like is that they make a group experience that much more fun.  In Wits & Wagers, the enjoyment comes from the betting, but it also comes from the group interaction that develops when answering questions and talking about the answers.  The game creates the situations that get people talking, so even people who don't know each other can start getting to know other people just from playing the game.

Say Anything sort of does this, but so much of the game depends on what the players put into it.  Sure, you can learn a lot about each other and get a lot of laughs from the answers, but if the players aren't getting in to the experience of it, and are just looking to win, then the game will fall flat.  For creative types who are already the kinds of people to interact with others, the game will be a hit; for people who don't belong to those groups, then it won't.

Say Anything is a light-hearted game about what you and your friends think. It gives you the chance to settle questions that have been hotly debated for centuries. For instance, "What is the most overrated band of all time?" or "Which celebrity would be the most fun to hang out with for a day?" So dig deep into your heart or just come up with something witty - this is your chance to Say Anything!

Hmmm...I definitely preferred playing [i]Wits and Wages[/i] instead of this one.  There's a similar betting mechanic in both games, but you're working at a disadvantage if you don't know the people you're playing with very well in [i]Say Anything [/i] but everyone else does.  There seemed to be quite a few questions about people's likes/dislikes, habits, hobbies, etc. for which you can make a pretty accurate guess if you know the person well. There were some open-ended questions in the mix that were more fun and seemed to even the playing field for everyone, but I wish there had been more of these questions in the box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun party game.  A blend of Wits & Wagers and Apples to Apples.  My only gripe is that many of the questions are rather pedestrian / boring, and it often degenerates into writing overly elaborate responses.  Update 9/11/17: the "overly elaborate" responses issue has sorta sunk this game for me.  It also doesn't help that the pens included with the game no longer work.  Will likely get rid of this -- for the previous reasons and the fact that it has been superseded by Codenames.

Every game of Say Anything that I've played has devolved into a series of answering questions with crude insults and references to acts that wouldn't be out of place in Cards Against Humanity.

And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. This game is great. The only downside is that, since this is a "party game," other games in my collection get played far more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Winning is largely beside the point in [i]Say Anything[/i] because the fun comes from creating a good answer and seeing how people react to it. Sure, you can try to guess what answer a judge might want to see, but getting a laugh from the group is far more satisfying, at least for the people I've been playing with.

It's fun, but the scoring is off. If A is leading, then no one will pick their answer (either as the active player, or the bettors).  And so on, so it degenerates into a second-order "guess who the active player will avoid" sort of thing, which is not what this game should be about.

I began by really liking this game- in fact, having it as one of my top favorites. But the people I play with do not enjoy it as much as I do and their lack of enthusiasm has influenced my opinion. Really though, I think they are right in saying that this game is best played as a completely silly, wacky, off the wall, not at all serious game. Unfortunately, I am far too self-conscious to do so and would much prefer to use this game as a Getting to Know You (Icebreaker) device or conversation starter. The game itself is great, I just play it for the wrong reasons.

Solid little party game that has Dixit-style "vote" scoring. Some raunchy answers definitely help things out =) Could fall flat with certain folks, though.

It has moments of fun but it relies too much on the people you are playing with to actually succeed in entertaining.

I think my friends would have a GREAT time with this... although it might get a little rude.  Need more party type games too.

Apples to Apples but where you write your own cards. I combined this set with the family edition.

Saying Anything is a good way to get arrested or assaulted, which is hardly an activity suitable for families.

If you are a biker family, forget everything I just said.

Another fun party game from North Star. Ask a question. Everyone writes anything they want as an answer. Everyone laughs. The judge uses a fancy choose-o-matic do-hickey to pick their fav answer. Everyone bets on the favorite. score points if you are right. Plays great.

Our favorite party game!  This one is a big hit with our families.  Even my mom loves this one, and she does not enjoy board games in general.  Even though the prompt questions are in English, my parents can write their responses in Chinese, which is great for our family games.

It is a cross between Apples to Apples and Wits and Wagers. It is easy for folks to pick up easily. It fun both to learn what people pick as their favorite answer and to see the weird answers people write to the questions. The only draw back is some people really struggle coming up with answers.

Party game from the makers of Wits & Wagers?  Yes please!  Wits & Wagers is one of my top games and I'm not really a party gamer.  I do need more Party games in my collection that I will enjoy playing and others will actually play.  I need an second game other than Wits & Wagers.

Just finished with a game that lasted over 3 hours..! This game is great for creating a setting to learn about people (icebreaker) and enjoy some time together!

This is a decent party game, and beats 'Apples to Apples' by a wide margin.  

In A2A both the question and answers are provided for you, thus little creativity is used. In this game only the question is provided, but players provide answers, thus there is more creativity, and you get to know the participates much better.

RATING: 6.5
Good and colourful components (though 1 of the purple chips missed).
The questions vary in quality. There are awesome questions of which the answers result in huge laughter ('What's the worst thing about being a woman?'; 'What's the weirdest thing that could happen right now?') and very boring and limited ones ('What's the best Julia Roberts movie?'; I had to go to the internet to figure out in which movies she's ever played, only to find out that I've seen only one of her movies).

RATING: 6
A 3-8 player party game. Players take turns being the judge and asking a question from a card. Other plays write down their answers, reveal them, and the judge secretly selects their favorite answer. Everyone then bets on which answer they think is correct, scoring points for being right.

A party game that does not descend into crude jokes all the time and actually allow players to get to know one another better. Gameplay and scoring are simple. A well-designed party game.

RATING: 7.5
A very good party game with lot's of fun that is upon various thematic questions that one player makes a question and the other have to answer what is the right answer according to the persion who made the question. Good 1 hour fun and recomended to people who gathered with friends frequently.

This is a fun party game, but it fits into the Apples to Apples/Cards Against Humanity mold for me. I don't enjoy those types of games for very long.

A gift from Gina and Chris Christmas 2010. Thanks guys!

I like creative thinking games and as this is less limiting I find it even more fun than Apples to Apples.  A better scoring system and cards that allow you to pick the most interesting topic for your group make this far and away the better game (though I'm torn between this and Wits & Wagers if I want a night full of laughs...)

Like most party games, Say Anything just isn't as fun when you play with people that know each other well.  The scoring is rather superfluous.  I'm just as happy to participate in answering the questions and guessing the correct response without it.  Good for the occasional laughs.

This just didn't work for me. With strangers, you just have to write clever answers. With family, you are going to have cliques of people who know the "right answer."

Traded for Aquaduct.

Good party game.  It takes the functional parts from Loaded Questions and Apples to Apples (2 games that I dislike) and makes them work.  Elegant.

Not really to my tastes.  It combines the betting of Wits & Wagers and the icky, icky arbitrary judging of Apples to Apples.  This is probably a great party game for most people, though!  Just not me.  :^/  (Sorry, Dom!  I think you're the bees knees!)

After 5+ Plays: The game is silly and fun, but there is an inherent problem with the scoring.  Unlike Apples to Apples you can see who submitted each answer, so it is easy to avoid giving those in the lead points.  This isn't a big deal with non-gamers who won't consider the scoring much, but as a party game for gamers I think Wits & Wagers works better.

A breezy party game that can be both silly and chaotic or interesting and thought-provoking, depending on the group and the dynamics. Easy to recommend.

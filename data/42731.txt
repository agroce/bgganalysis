Another outstanding addition to the Lock n Load system! Another great game from Mark Walker!

RATING: 8
I'm pretty sure my rating will go up since this is a game that explores different strategical options and offers a very impressive variety of scenarios. The map is one of the best designed maps in the latest released games. Not just aesthetically speaking, but in its concept. Open fields and cities are disposed in a very interesting way. 
Units have reacher options of fire. Tanks' ranges are huge and this makes the battlefield a constant crossing of fire from almost every corner of the map. You mustn't be afraid to risk units in this game, you must play boldly. For all the LnL system fans this is a great new installment.

High production quality.
Tight scenarios, either side could win, usually on the last turn.

Great fun.

And one more great game from Lock'n Load Publishing! Thanks to Mark Walker and L'nL Publishing Team!

Most of the scenarios are too big to manage - especially because of the high number of vehicles.
Somehow LnL feels and plays better with smaller scenarios.

Lock N Load meets the Cold War!  This would be my favorite game module in the LNLT system, along with all relevant expansions.  The modern battlefield is deadly this game demonstrates that quite nicely.

RATING: 6
Generally a great system.  This module misses on the adaptation to modern, high-intersity warfare; it still remains a dismounted-infantry focused system.  The map lacks the ranges and elevation deferences found in former US sector of West Germany.  They should have gone with large poster size maps in order to fit even the most modest of real valleys, and finally renovated the terrible elevations sub-system.

Initial rating based on a read through the rules and the quite frankly amazing production value. Simply the most attractive wargame I own.

RATING: 8
Very good game with a great atmosphere. My only minor issue is the 'historical' map which kind of limits the number of scenarios you can play on (and I won't elaborate too much on the map itself with 'towns' being composed of only a few buildings'). I'm looking forward to seeing expansions published for this game (with french, german, polish troops etc...).

The Lock 'n Load series is getting alot of table time for me, quick scenarios, relatively simple rules, but very fun little tactical problems.  This is the '85 war in europe that didn't happen...fun to play with those toys

UP in shrink copy available also
surprise win. I bought it just for the WaW tie in. My first LnL title.
Immersive squad combat. 
Pretty straight forward rules, if not a bit verbose.
Fire and Melee are interesting. Melee is innovative for sure.
The ability to 'sneak, low crawl' os freaking cool.

Really amazingly good counters and maps.
LOVE the photos on counters for leader/hero traits.
Really like the tank and helo elements.

Like to see more on Arty. Smoke needs to be one hex and easier to do.

About the same complexity as basic SL; about the same detail as COI. The game I've been waiting for since I got interested in late cold war armour over 30 years ago.

The idea of WWIII has always interested me. I was a M1 tank gunner in the 80's and I like wargames that are on the individual tank scale. This game fits the bill perfectly (WWIII tank/squad level). I have several of the other LNL games so getting started with this one was a snap.

The quality of the game is excellent. The map and counters are truely state of the art. The scenarios are awesome. Just reading through the scenarios is pretty fun because they tell the story of what might have happened. I really like the way the rules have progressed. The core rules give everything you need to know to play any of the LNL games. Then there are module specific rules that are just for that specific game. For example, you don't need to learn about ATGMs if you are playing WWII. 

LNL Frogotten Heroes: Vietnam is my favorite game of all but this one is going to give it a run for it's money.

hmmmmmmm, I am not convinced. Somebody said that Lock n' Load is about infantry. This module is a deviation of the real spirit of this system.

And I don't like the map. It is not small yet not big enough for the range of some weapons. I don't think that LnL is for WWIII as it is not for WWI.

Something about Korea would have been more interesting to me. Chinese, Koreans, Cold War, the fifties...

Love the system, love the setting. Great art, jam packed with content. Can only really fault the board for not including quite enough variety of terrain, but it's gorgeous to look at.

I had the pleasure of playtesting this module, and was able to play 1/2 of the scenarios.  They were all very good and creative.  

I always like to see a game that I playtested in it's printed form.  This one is AWESOME!!!  I think this may be the best LnL game to date (and maybe the best wargame that I have ever seen.).  Graphics are great, and the print quality is very good.  Well worth the wait in print time.

Now off to finish the remainder of the scenarios that I didn't playtest.

WW3 Squad Leader...I hope it can become so.  House to house, infantry tactics with combined arms from tanks and the air assets set in the hypthetical world war during the initial Soviet onslaughts into the town of Eisenbach, a designer made-up city on the border of the Cold War frontier.  An interesting design utilizing the WW2 squad level system for a WW3.  

P.S. I should buy and read the designer's own created world novel - "World at War Revelation" later.

Note to self and others on spotting rules by SJ:

"Being Spotted is status-driven, so in order to be Spotted, a hex must contain a Fire counter, a Move counter, an Assault Move counter, a Spotted counter, be adjacent to a good-order enemy, or be in Open terrain.

If none of these things are true, the hex is not Spotted.

Note: Spotted counters are removed if a hex is ever empty."

By far, the most clear explanation to the spotting rules for the Lock n' Load series.

This is my second LnL-series game and has further enamored me toward the series (after Heroes of the Blitzkrieg).  The artwork throughout is gorgeous, components are absolute top-quality, and the system is a great blend of simplicity and depth.

After making it over the hurdle of the rules (which really are simple but the rulebook does not make them seem simple), there is an awesome game under there. It just plays right. 

Moves quickly, things happen, feels logical, plenty of chrome, lavish components...

Not sure what else you could look for in a tactical game. A wonderful system.

And it's in the World at War fiction!

I always love Lock N Load squad games and have practically everything. this is up to standard and interesting with a superb map. My one complaint is that the smaller counters are a bit cardboardy and lacking the gloss of most others in the series and the portraits for leaders are a little cartoonish. I'll let it pass though as I think I have been spoilt by LnL's excellent standards throughout my time spent getting to know the series.

 My first entry into the LnL series. I learnt to love squad-level tactical games with Combat Commander, so I tried this game for its original theater of war, and for the openness of its game system. The ruleset is not as streamlined and as refined as CC's one, but it is more of a sandbox, which means the system can be easily expanded (ie : you can have tanks... Heck, you even get helis and bombers !!) After my first play, I think this could be the ideal balance between playability and theme/realism for me (since I don't have the time to learn the ASL ruleset, and I'm not that fond of WWII). Can't wait for the french expansion, Honneur et Patrie.

Amen to a non-WW2 squad level game.  The overall package may be the best set of components in a LnL series game so far.  Scenarios seem far different than previous as the use of SSRs is at its best, IMO.  They add detail without the rules for setups, random events, or some sort of battlefield extras / fog of war.

Balance seems pretty tight although initially I think they favor the Soviets.  The scenarios also give a great mix or infantry pure, infantry heavy (with a few supporting vehicles), and vehicle heavy.

The rules are the series rules with the updates and additions for modern arms.

The map is fantastic, but I wish it had geomorphic edges for future add-ons.  And the box could be a bit bigger so you could store the punched counters in the box with the rest of the components.  If I was to complain about one thing : the range of modern weapons makes the map a crowded place to fight and shows its heaviest impact on ATGMs which will have minimal standoff distance when firing (i.e. you are going to be close to lots of enemy units).

Initially picked this up to satisfy the completist in me, but there's a lot to like. Tons of armor and combined arms engagements plus unique setting that reminds me of Ralph Peters's Red Army. Prefer geomorphic maps to the single large one, but it works fine for these scenarios.

Neither complex enough or simple enough. Rules sit in an awkward middle ground for me. I like the subject matter, however.

RATING: 4
probably the most unintuitive set of rules i came accross this far....what this series desperately needs is continuity. Sometimes the counters are glossy sometimes not, they vary in thickness, the board (geo) are 5mm wider in one of the games wich makes it hard to use with others...

This has been getting some great reviews so hope it is awesome.

It is loosely based on the World at War series time line.

I am highly impressed with the quality of the game components of this game.

Great map board, the chits fall off the boards so no tearing at corners, game cards are a little thin but still look very nice but not sure how long they will last with play. I'm sure my concern is unfounded.

The only complaint I do have is the dice.  The box and all the components that came in it didn't fit perfect. SO what ended up happening one portion of the counter sheet (specifically my BDRM vehicle for the Soviets) has indention's where the dice were as well as one corner of the box.

Except for that one thing it looks extremely well done. Scenario's are on a nice color (like a good photo paper type quality) card stock. 

Comes with version 3.1 of the Lock N Load rules.  What is different from the 3.0 version? Haven't had a chance to take a close look.

Then of course it comes with the Module Specific rules as well.

Looks to be another great game from Lock N Load. Looking forward to giving it a shot.

The LnL Tactical system plays very quickly and certainly tells a action movie type story.  

I do like the you go/I go impulse structure - does allow for a more dynamic ebb and flow.

However, I disliked the spotting rules (understand why they are there) and I dislike the small maps.   Everything felt very constricted.

Further, for the Modern games, I felt the maps artificially made ATGM less effective.  With scenarios that use 20-30 hexes wide maps - and ATGMs are innefective at less than 10 - there are limited uses for them.

Further, it reduces the viability of modern armor who are designed to stand off at 1000+ meters but the scenarios start at less than 1/2 that.  Just felt off.

Want to stress there is nothing wrong with the system per-se, it is simply not for me.

This one is great too. You will see that each side have their on strength and weaknesses. The lethality could be important, like all tactical with modern warfare weapons. The mobility has increased dramatically, so take care of all these helicopters, tanks and light armored vehicles, they can wreck havoc on your flank very quickly or take benefit of a hole in your defense.

Beautiful map and counters (what I wish ASL aspired to). A good system that creates a plausible play experience, but marred by poorly-written, poorly-organized rules. 

On revisiting the game, found it was more trouble than it's worth.

Nice simple game. Very nicely made (black series) and fun to play, especially for Star Wars fans of course. But pretty imbalanced, the Rebels tend to win more easily. And very dependable on luck! Regardless of any strategy, the winning side can suddenly change with one unlucky throw of dice...
Next time we will try to see if any rules adaptation might bring more balance. Although playing time is quite short we didn't want to start a new game right after the first...

It's slightly annoying that this game has "RISK" in the title, because it's not really like RISK at all. This is really a light little wargame with card-based actions and several different battles going on that is a reimplementation of the older game Star Wars: The Queen's Gambit. It is quite good, easy to teach and play, and doesn't actually take much time, typically taking only 30-45 minutes. One of the best Star Wars board games out there, in my opinion.

Quite a fun game, although it has really almost nothing to do with Risk at all.  Someone skewed towards the Rebels winning, but both sides have fun playing regardless.  Fun to play.

I just cannot find the balance.  Tried many variants and no matter which I use, or not use, one side is clearly at the advantage.  Plus, the closest to parity the game gets the more the Luke-Vader battle has to be ultimately ignored.

Shame, because before my son and I uncovered the imbalance, we had a lot of fun playing.

RATING: 8
What a game, again the stigma of a mass produced game by Hasbro meant expectations were not high to begin with but by the end I was enthralled with the game. 

It felt exactly like the original trilogy's 2nd movie and literally each  reveal of a card or dice roll had my heart beating. I truly felt immersed into the world of Star Wars from the gameplay and everything made sense thematically. Also the game plays within less than an hour and has very easy to learn rules, a great bang for your buck. I also played the black edition and the quality of the game is fine but I can't comment on the quality of the 'lesser' edition. 

Downsides are that the game is very much a luck based game. There is strategic value of the order you play your cards and which actions hedge against another but in the end if you can't roll well, it is all for naught as there are no way to change or mitigate bad dice rolls. Also, it seems that the rebel player has a small edge although it feels very close. As once the Rebels bring the Deathstar's shields down. All they need is a ship to hit the Deathstar with a 6 and wins while the Empire needs to destroy every rebel ship on the board. 

That being said, I must admit I am more of a theme player and to me this game was quick, very thematic, gave me the good stress and many a story to tell afterwards. Cant recommend it enough.

RATING: 7
1st play: This game is a good time. The bits all over the board, the golden Millennium Falcon, the Death Star and the Executor. Ships everywhere and dice galore make this an enjoyable dice chucker. The name says Risk but that just makes me wish Risk were as much fun to play. My main concern with the game is that it may not be balanced between the two sides. As a plus, the game limits decisions such that it allows two people of different gamer cred to play on fair footing. 

2nd play: Played again, this time with my 7 year old. He had a blast and barely eeked out a win, although I might have been able to beat him if I had killed Luke one turn sooner I decided him having fun was more important than winning. I'll have to play a few more times to get a feel for balance, because Empire seems stronger.

RATING: 7
This game does have a slight feel of the older Queens Gambit, but it plays more quickly and has a different tactics to it.

I do feel that the battle with Darth Vader, the Emperor and Luke Skywalker seem to be slightly undermined. The extra cards received after defeating Vader or Luke does help the other sector get a quick boost. In such, it could be overpowering or completely useless depending on the current situation.

The shield generator sector is like a Yahtzee game for the rebellion. 

The space battle is slightly more interesting, but a single 6 to destroy the Death Star is both gamey as well as a saving grace for a badly battered rebellion. 

Take it as a light game for all ages. Nothing too In-depth, nothing too serious. In this point of view, it is a RISK game.

Overall, fun to play and easy to learn. A reasonable game for your collection.

A quite enjoyable version of risk. Yes, it is quite a dice fest and thus a bit random, however there is enough decision making to make it interesting. If you focus in an area you can win that area, even with marginal rolling. The game pieces are very attractive and I'd even consider getting the game and making up different rules to make it even more strategic. The theme is immersive.

Star Wars : Queen's Gambit for those who don't have the $$ to shell out or get lucky enough to get one in trade. We did so this went on the trade pile.

Black edition - great components, and a fun game if you love the movies and don't mind a luck driven card/dice game. Some house rules make it a bit more challenging/balanced IMO.

RATING: 8
A fun Risk variant in which you are competing on three fronts, an Endor track, a Luke vs. Vader/Emperor track, and then the central space battle area. The Rebel player must win the Endor battle to destroy the Death Star, and accomplishing goals on either of the side battles grants a player a small stack of bonus actions. I also like the Order cards, they each feature multiple choices you can make, some pertaining to the different battles. Moving and rolling ships is still pretty easy, and the fights seem tight and relatively well balanced.

This is my nephew, a nine year old star wars fan's favorite board game.  What I don't like a) its hard to remember all the fiddly rules such as what you need to roll for success on different situations - a table would have been nice in the rule book, b) not enough effort went on balancing different strategies in the rules so whilst there are lots of choices a lot of the time the rebel player will rush endor and then destroy the death star whilst the empire player will spam death star attacks to eliminate groups and ships and get exta plays in the round. c) The Rebels have a much easier time of this ohh and d) too much die rolling for my taste.  Still a great game to play with the nephew and people have come up with player aides and rule tweaks to enhance the game.

Great little game. STUPID marketing name from Hasbro as this is NOT Risk (thankfully). 

It is an excellent Star Wars themed game with good mechanics to simulate the pinacle of the battle between the Dark side and the Good side.

As the Rebels you have to destroy the Death Star and as the Empire you need to kill all rebellion Fighters...

30-45 minutes of great tense playing time. Not a "wargame" but a good theme anyway.

Go for the (limited?) Black edition as the components and box are great.

I think it is better than most "heavier" Star War games because it comes down to the essential thing about games: FUN.

Although it is rolling a lot of dice: luck tends to even out with lots of them and in the end management of luck counts and, yes, a few tactics make the difference.

In most of the games I played it comes down to these last few draws and rolls.

---------------

About balance: 16 games tracked: 8/8 wins for both sides. 4 players involved. 2 sessions with 4 player game.

Using the official rules with the clarifications published on BGG. No need to tweak anything really. Just adapt your strategy according to the other player's kind of play.

Great game and with a 30 minute playing time perfect for anyone who wants some fun..

Excellent 2p light strategy space battle game. The rules as-is seem to heavily favor the Rebels so if you're looking to balance things there are some house rules you should adopt. If you just are looking for a fun and fairly quick dice-chucking combat game set in the Star Wars universe, then look no further.

We really enjoyed our play of this. Sander was able to beat me using the Rebel forces, but it was very tense. He did the "redeem Vader" action, which gave him a whopping 5 bonus orders. He was then able to knock down the shield generator and blow up the Death Star later the same turn. The order system makes this game fun. There are enough tough decisions to really make me want to get it back to the table ASAP. Components are OK for a mass market game. This was a winner!

Fun game that has got absolutely nothing to do with original Risk. Based on The Queen's Gambit grail game, though thankfully it's Return of the Jedi and not the boring Phantom Menace.

Simple combat and rules. Plays quick, and I like that you have three different things going on at the same time. Taking down the shield on Endor, Luke vs Darth Vader, and the attack on the Death Star. Not very deep, but I like that your decisions are quick to make. If flows nice and quickly.

Nice to get a blast of Star Wars. Well-written rules.

Black Series has actually been selling for less lately than the standard version. But standard version is okay, the board is not as bad as some folks say. Cards are a little thin. It's passable.

The tiny minis are fun as is the tie-fighter shaped board.

This is essentially a fine tuned revamp of the Star Wars' grail Game, Queen's Gambit.  The game takes place during the conclusion of Return of the Jedi and focuses on the three concurrent battles in the film.  You take turns playing cards which lets you participate in one of the battles.  You chuck dice for everything.  Both sides feel pretty balanced with just enough strategies to make it all interesting.  The whole ordeal is over in 45 mins tops.  It's a tight and clean design.  The game is just fun.  Pure and simple.  If this came out during the theatrical run of RotJ and it was now OOP, it would be a grail game. THIS IS PURE, MASS MARKET, CLASSIC, AMERITRASH GOODNESS!  They don't make em like this anymore folks.  Buy it while it's available.

A super light/simplified take on Queen's Gambit.  Unfortunately it's too simplified.  Especially the two "side" battles.  Even with the quick playtime there's not much game here.  Play it once and you're done.  It's a shame too, the fancy edition is nicely done.

Tense, fast, and dripping with theme.  Rebels have a hell of a time surviving in space against the fleet/Death Star, and need to hold out for a squeaker win; Imperials need to crush the fleet fast before the Death Star is exposed.  After a few plays to learn rules, this can be set up in 5 minutes and played in another 20.  Black Edition worth extra cash for the box/insert and nicer board/cards, but wait for an Amazon sale to drop it to around $30.

A great light game. It's hard to tell how often this will come out now that I have Star Wars: Rebellion as well, but this is a more reliable 4 player experience, AND it's like 40 minutes, so I think it fills a good niche... just one that may only come out with star wars fans that are non-gamers. Overall though, this is just a dice chucking, space ship blasting great time, and it does have a good amount of theme. A great one, I'm just not sure I would go for it over some of the other star wars games, but as an "almost" Queen's Gambit, I'm glad to have it, and it does create those excitingly random moments that in a light game, I can't help but love.

RATING: 8
9/14/2015 - I've played this game over half a dozen times now, and I'm positive that the rebel player has a strong advantage. This game SYSTEM is really cool, but the balance sucks. Some variants are going to be needed to bring things back into balance. I'm still rating this an 8 for now though. For what this game is (an ameritrash filler) it's really neat. Once the balance issues are worked out, it'll be fantastic.

9/16/2015 - I think we've worked out the right combo of variants now, to keep this an even matchup. I'm recording the 3 changes here for posterity sake:

1) When the Death Star destroys a Rebel fleet marker, the Empire player gains a bonus card whether there were ships on that fleet marker or not (as if the Empire player had cleared a normal space sector).

2) When the Empire player plays an Endor action, the Rebel Endor token is moved backward 1 space before the 3 Stormtrooper tokens are added. The Rebel marker is moved backward regardless of whether the Empire player has any Stormtrooper tokens remaining. Once the shield has been destroyed by the Rebel player, the Empire player can no longer perform this action.

3) During an Empire player's Endor action, Stormtrooper tokens are added to the 3 spaces in front of the rebel Endor marker (after it has been moved 1 space backward), even if this causes stacks of multiple Stormtrooper tokens in some spaces. The +1 tokens are cumulative, though a roll of "6" always succeeds for the Rebel player.

Fast streamlined version of Queen's Gambit with less visual flair.  It doesn't come close to replacing Queen's Gambit but it's a fine proxy if you don't own the better version.  It's also likely worth having in addition to QG if you're a huge Star Wars fan, and it has the nice benefit of playing much quicker.

The only thing causing me concern right now is that it appears the Luke/Vader battle is kind of pointless.  It seems like a huge card sink for a reward that does not total up to the effort.  The game also seems slanted towards the Empire with the rule clarifications posted on the forums.

Black edition. 

Lots of fun. The balance was bad until I found the clarifications and applied them carefully:

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1447610/some-rules-clarifications

Now I'm not 100% sure that it doesn't imbalance the game in the opposite direction, but it feels more like the movie: the Rebels are in more desperate straights and, possibly, need to consider going after Vader to avoid stalemate situations, depending on the cards (though this may just waste temp for consecutive turns that don't add up to much, since you're effectively giving your opponent consecutive non-random turns).

it's a nice tight little game that needed a slightly better rulebook. Time well tell if the Tie-figher spam strategy is beatable; definitely need to keep the Falcon alive and ready to pounce when an opening arrives. It's one of those games where it is easy to fall into a steady strategy when it might actually be better to diversify and try different options. Some commenters imply that it's almost broken, but I'm not so sure that they aren't just playing the same person and not being imaginative. We'll see....

A fun, fast reinterpretation of the Queen's Gambit system.  Less lavish, less choices, less dice, less playing time, less fun, but fun none-the-less.  Seriously, this has so much less than Gambit that it's even a bit of a stretch to call it "Queen's Gambit Light".  "Extremely Light" might be better.  I've heard it called Ameritrash Filler, and that's a fair comment.

If I had the time, I'd probably prefer to play the Queen's Gambit, but I'd have to have _a lot_ more time.  Risk: Star Wars Edition can be played on a weeknight between dinner and homework ... Gambit is a weekend only, half day affair.  

I do worry that after a couple games, the Empire's strategy has become clear and they are unbeatable.

It is sad to see how much less you get in the Black Box edition than you did for less money in Queen's Gambit 15 years ago.

Components (0.5/2.0)  Ugh!  Production values were cheap on this one and it shows.  Cardboard chits for everything and a very flimsy game board.  I bought this game for cheap however, so I can't complain but if you bought this for retail, you are probably not going to be happy.  Did use the MicroMachines add on suggested by Pair of Dice Paradise and it works well.  The plastic models for this game though are excellent!
Gameplay (1.5/2.0)  The rulebook needs work as many questions concerning bonus card mechanics needs to be formally corrected.  Otherwise, very fun game play and quick!!!  Definitely not playing Risk here.
Theme (1.0/1.0) Theme works nicely with the game play. No comments to be made otherwise.
Replayability (1.0/1.0) Definitely there.  Gameplay is simple but you will develop a variety of strategies and ideas you want to carry out in future games.  
Enjoyment (3.0/4.0) Personally, I like the game and will replay it.  Not my favorite game but enjoyable none the less.  The gaming group showed doubt at first, but got into the game and was willing to play again.

It's NOT Risk. At all.

It's a streamlined version of Queen's Gambit, with just 3 battlefield areas instead of 4, just one deck of cards per player instead of two and set around the Battle of Endor instead of the Battle of Naboo.

It's light, it's fun, it's got a lot of dice-rolling...
And it's Star Wars.

After playing Queen's gambit, I dropped my opinion of this game. You can churn out a good few rounds and the game doesn't overstay its welcome, but I just don't find it's balanced enough and the only battle that means anything is the space battle. Not sure whether I'll keep this or not.

RATING: 7
Don't know why they called it Risk -- it's got nothing in common with Risk, but it's still a lot of fun.  The miniatures look excellent too.  Both sides war and compete to achieve their own objectives and games always seem to end close, coming down to the wire.  After a few playthroughs I could see the lack of variety and same objectives wearing thin, but it's a solid 2 player dueling game from a major developer and publisher with a huge license.

"Emperor's Gambit"  Ha, I love it!  Funny, but true.  I've only seen Queen's Gambit playthrough videos, but the gameplay seems quite similar.  Seems to be a slight advantage for the Rebels in this game.  Han Solo moves too quickly in the beginning, even with Stormtroopers in the way.  It pays to kill Luke/Vader right away, as that influx of command cards is a HUGE boost.  The redeem itself seems broken.  House ruled that one too = Roll 3 D6 and you need one 6.  Nothing that can't be "fixed".

Where Queen's Gambit is plastic overload, this one has bits that are just okay.  I've already upgraded my Millennium Falcon and Star Destroyer tokens with Micro Machines.  I may just have to borrow the Han Solo and Storm Trooper minis from Epic Duels if I can't find other bits.  This game is quite fun and a decent value even at $30 MSRP!

Very FUN game to play!

I love how this game just feels like the movie: Return of the Jedi.  The theme of fighting Darth Vader, racing to shut off the shield to the Death Star on planet Endor, and fighting tie fighters, really comes through in this game.  The game is surprisingly a lot of fun. I want to play this again!

Positives: good theme, and fun to play.
Negative: Imperials seem to be at a bigger disadvantage - the Rebels seem to win every game we play.  
Also, there is a little too much luck in the die rolls, and somewhat with the card draws.

Interesting recreation of both final scenes of Star Wars IV and VII.
The gameplay runs fairly simple and with a strong appeal for the theme. It can be played in half an hour and the reprodution of combats between ships (fueled by a card draft) is well concieved.
However, the game has some serious downsides:
- Is too much "light" (almost no strategic decisions), is enormous inbanlanced in favour of the rebels, the sabre laser duel is pointless and the battle of Endor is no more than a formality in gameplay (it is only a question of brief time for the rebels to easily take it down).  
Have serious doubts if these problems can be dealt through home rules only.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Surprisingly fun.
However, it feels like there are distinct "optimal" strategies for both sides. The dark side should concentrate on getting the Death Star ready, and the light side should focus on anything that gives you extra actions.

There's been a long time since I was amazed so much by a game. I love Star Wars but I was never keen on Risk, not even as a kid. So I passed it wen I saw it at a toy store. A couple of hours later I saw a review of the game. Wow! I still prefer The Queen's Gambit, but Risk: Star Wars Edition makes two things better. Each battle matters (I never gave much atention to the battleield in the first game) and secondly it's about a better movie! Shitty name, great game! Hey, it rhymes!

I never played the Queen's Gambit and have only played this a couple of times, so this is a quick impression. This is a fast playing game where you have to balance competing priorities. Pretty good balance between strategy and luck and major events can swing the game. Have to say the components are pretty sad, with cheap plastic miniatures and really poor quality cards.

Simpler than Queen's Gambit and perhaps slightly better because it is more focused and represents a movie that is just more interesting in the series.

Wow, when someone brought this out to the game table, I rolled my eyes and thought oh great, themed Risk... What's next, Simpson's Monopoly? But wow, it was a Surprise hit for me. It plays very quickly and effortlessly, with some interesting decisions to make. I only played it with 2 people and can't see playing with more people.

Not sure why they labled it Risk, since it has almost noing to do with it. I suppose it draws in the mass market, but may turn away the hardcore board gamer.

In the end, I don't give two squirts about the Star Wars craze, but I still got something out of is game.

So glad I finally got to try this! Yeah- it's pretty much a dice-chucker, but the Star Wars theme makes it extremely palatable. The semi-programmed action card mechanic works well too. I found the two side battles (Endor and Luke vs. Vader) a little too basic and I wish there was something extra going on rather than more dice chucking. The real fun is with the central space attack. Doesn't overstay its welcome and enjoyable for all ages and all fans. Nothing with any real depth, but as Hasbro Star Wars-tie in games go, this probably is the best they've done. (And given it's a reskin of one of the more popular SW games to come out - The Queen's Gambit - I guess it's no surprise.

"The Endor Gambit" for anyone who has played Queens Gambit

The system is very similar with 3 battlefield fronts but untimately the rebels are trying to take down the shield generator in 1 part and then fire into the death star to blow it up. The empire just needs to secure victory in space to prevent the death star from blowing up

I thought the game was decent but overall a little shallow for my liking, especially since I've played Queens Gambit and other 1v1 battle games. The different areas seemed very 1 dimensional except maybe the Space battle. I wish there was a bit more tactical card play for each section

I'm looking for a bit more depth in my 1v1 games as there are a lot of 2p games now that offer good depth and replayability in a short time span.

Queen's Gambit light. A good two player game with a decent amount of theme. Given the choice between this and Queen's Gambit, I would probably play Queen's Gambit, but that's not a choice many are going to have.

If you love star wars, you  will probably love this game. The theme is used well, for it takes place at the end of Return of the Jedi with the 3 fronts of fighting(Luke VS. Vadar, Battle on Endor, and the space battle above Endor) I really like that there are three battles going on at once which makes a deeper, more strategic game. Although it is strategic, it is very easy to learn and play. It is best for just 2 players and may takes about 30 minutes. I do like the painted miniatures... they are not the best quality, but you get what you pay for. Other than that, there are great mechanics involved.

This is very, very good.  I was impressed.  Card based commands add a lot.  Not like regular Risk at all. 

Also, after playing my copy of the Queen's Gambit, this is  distillation of that game.  It is, in some ways, better, as it it is more streamlined and the end game isn't a cumbersome.  Plus it's real Star Wars and not George Lucas's screw up...

RATING: 8
Only played as a 2 player.  I'll admit it scores big points for me for being set on the final scenes of Return of the Jedi, including the Fleet battle around the death star, assault on Endor, and the Duel between Vader and Luke.  Handfuls of little space ships also don't hurt my rating.  :)

  Game seems difficult for the Empire player, so this really needs to played with that in mind. Great for kid vs dad, if Dad is the Empire.  Some house ruling could be played with, if you're unhappy with the balance.  As is, we haven't tinkered yet.  Still enjoyable play, probably much more so if you like the original trilogy setting.

While other than ship components seem cheap, I've already replaced the Destroyer and Falcon chits with plastic minis from a 90's Star Wars Monopoly, and a "Titanium" branded metal Death Star sits over the DS graphic on the space board.  Minis of Han, Chewie, Stormtroopers, Luke, Vader, Empire Officer, Emperor, & Emperor's Guards replace the other card board chits on the count trackers.  Got most of the minis from my copy of Star Wars Epic Duels, and the others from the SW minis game.  All were things I had at the house.  Self pimping could get expensive if you were to track all these models down.  With that in mind a "black series" release is coming to Amazon with minis for the Destroyer, Falcon, and Death Star, if you want to wait for that edition.

This   game will be attractive to young fans of the theme. The card are cool but the board is gimmicky and with low durability. The game is imbalanced heavily towards the rebel alliance. Even with a huge lead the empire could not finish the deal. This is understandable with very young  Star Wars fans as not many may wish to root for the Empire. The battle between Luke and Darth is very simplistic and can really tilt the game. The mechanics are akward here.

This game really surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. As a big fan of The Queen's Gambit, I thought that this extremely stripped-down version might not be able to offer a similar experience. And yet, it does. In only about 30 minutes, it distills the essence of one of my favorite games into a still quite enjoyable experience. There is far less to manage, no reading to do (kids can handle this), and it still looks great on the table, especially the black box version. It's not as deep (and thus really not as appealing as a 2v2 team game) and it's more prone to swings due to there being fewer die rolls throughout the course of the game, but it is generally a very exciting finish. It still retains the same unique Queen's Gambit feel of "I need to do everything at once" and also "I need to only do this one thing" simultaneously while swaths of figures die with each roll of the dice. I love you, Craig Van Ness. "I know."

Between the standard game that give an edge to the rebels and the revised rules which push the empire toward a TIE fighters spam strategy, I find that no set of rules reach the balance that would be needed to have each of the 3 battles equally interesting.

RATING: 4
Having a hard time seeing the appeal in this one. It's a very light game, and might appeal to children, but it's not light or quick enough to be a filler, and not nearly meaty enough to be a satisfying weightier game. Some of the flaws: 
1. It seems unbalanced towards the rebels. 
2. The Luke/Vader track appears nearly useless. In our first game it didn't get used at all. It would take at least 3 or 4 plays - if you roll perfectly - to win that fight and the reward is what? A few more cards in hand, which doesn't help as I always seemed to have plenty of cards to do what I wanted. And yet that doesn't change the biggest flaw in this game:
3. Lack of meaningful decisions. There really isn't a lot to it. There's no real room for brilliant maneuvers or evasive strategies. There's no surprises. It's pretty obvious that the Rebs are going to run the shields down, and the Emps are gonna spawn Tie Fighters and Death Ray stuff. It's like a dry chicken wing with no meat and no flavor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Don't underestimate this game. This is Star Wars VI in the box. This realy gives the feeling of Star Wars VI last battle. If you don't reach the shield generator - you can't attack Death star. Side battle between Luke and Vader - not that it matters for winning the game, but it gives slight advantage, so can't ignore that. And epic space battle - a couple of games have ended with single ship attacking Death star and rolling 6.

THIS GAME IS NOT RISK!
This game is THE EMPEROR'S GAMBIT!
Now that that's taken care of...I love this game! It is so simple and fast playing, very thematic, has strong replay value, cool little ships, and just plain fun. I'm really glad I picked it up. It's a great game to teach someone to play and could be an excellent gateway game. I can easily see moving someone from this to Memoir 44 and then to maybe Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles. Or maybe War of the Ring. Regardless, a lot of fun in a compact game that can play in under 30 minutes.

There are complaints about the components and about balance. I personally think the components are fine, and while the Empire has the harder path to victory, with experience (about 20 games and counting)we are finding the game to be pretty balanced. When first starting, let the stronger player be the Empire.

Update - with just around 30 plays, I think the game is pretty balanced for both players. The space battle is where both sides need to focus, while making advances on the other tracks when time and cards permit. The bonus cards from the duel can be huge, but if you don't win the duel, those actions are essentially wasted. Still a great game though I've decided to bring the rating to a more reasonable 8.

RATING: 4.1
I was quite excited when I read that this was a reworking of Queen's Gambit(QG), re-themed to Return of the Jedi! I own Queen's Gambit and I love it, so I was excited not just because I enjoy Return of The Jedi much more than Phantom Menace but also for the many people that can't/won't pay the outrageous second market prices for QG. However, I was bitterly disappointed at a number of things. For main-stream purposes I guess this is a step in the right direction as it's probably better than most games currently on the TRU and Walmart shelves. Still, this version is watered down so much that I can't help but shake my head.

At first glance you'll see that the production value took a huge downward turn. They replaced the diverse and very nice miniatures with small bland unappealing game pieces. I can't even call them miniatures. Not only do they look and feel cheap but they've excluded anything unique.  B-Wings, Y-Wings, X-Wings, and a ton of TIEs, may be cool but they used cardboard to represent the Millenium Falcon and the Executor! They also chose to exclude Vader and Luke figures whereas QG had Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul. I understand that miniatures cost a lot and this is aimed squarely at the mass market as opposed to QG but this was a big miss for me. At $20 less retail, I guess it's justified but still... 

The game board design is cute, even my daughter liked how it was shaped like a TIE fighter. However, compared to Queen's Gambit it's pretty bad. You have the main board (TIE cockpit) where the ships battle and the two side boards (TIE wings) which are only for tracking the progress of the other two parts of the game, the battle between Luke and Vader/Emperor and the progress of the rebel squad taking down the shields on Endor.


Finally, they streamlined the number of things going on from four (space battle, Jedi Battle, ground battle, Anakin's journey) to just three (Luke/Vader battle, space battle, shield mission). Frankly, all three are much worse than the original four. The cards are simplistic and therefore less strategic and the space battle has been convoluted (IMO). I guess the shield mission and Anakin's journey aren't THAT much different but the shield mission just seems to fall flat.

All-in-all, if you missed out on Queen's Gambit than I'm quite sad to tell you that this is a nothing but a shadow of it's prior self and it's not worth your time or money. It wouldn't register a blip on the BGG radar if it wasn't being compared to QG. Sadly, I fell prey. Luckily I got it cheap ($10) and I hope you find it some day at a thrift store if you're desperate to give it a try. (I'll also trade you my copy, if you still want to play it after reading this)

Nice design. In isolation each of the three sub-games would fall flat, but taken together under the umbrella of the card activation system they provide a decent, lightweight strategy game.

Prioritising which of the three sub-games you want to fight - always assuming you have the cards to do so - can be pretty challenging.

The game gets leaner in the end game, when some cards are of limited or no value as sub-games close out and the action focuses on the main battle on the central board.

Strategy for the rebel player is probably more obvious than that for the empire player, which even with the designer's rules clarifications is probably the tougher side to play.

Blast for star wars fans and I'm a little biased because I love any game that I can play with my son and have a good time.

Risk: Star Wars Edition is an extremely thematic reenactment of the final events of "Return of the Jedi." The various elements blend together smoothly, making for an integrated experience. The space battle is certainly the centerpiece strategically and where victory will be determined, but the side conflicts play their respective parts. The various options on the cards provide you with the ability to plan ahead while offering some degree of flexibility. The simplicity of combat makes for quick, exciting gameplay. The game feels slightly imbalanced in favor of the Rebels, but not so much that it breaks the game. The high quality components add the finishing touches for a very enjoyable Star Wars gaming experience!

Short but sweet board game version of the Battle of Endor.  Though it may have Risk on the box, this game plays nothing like traditional Risk in that it entirely revolves around the Battle of Endor as seen in Return of the Jedi.  The game features three different aspects: the Rebels on the forest moon trying to destroy the shield generator, the battle between Luke and Vader on the Death Star, and the space battle itself.  The combat is fun but doesn't require a great deal of strategy; essentially the Empire wants to put up a defensive ring around the Death Star when the shield generator is inevitably destroyed while the Rebels want to punch a hole in the Imperial fleet so that Lando can go "yeehaw!" and blow up the station.  The only thing that brings this game down really is that it seems heavily favored towards the Rebellion winning the battle.  In the six or so games (which have never lasted longer than 45 minutes) I've played with my friend, the Rebels have won every time no matter which of us is playing as either side.  So while it is cool to recreate the movie, after a few times, the charm starts to wear off as you wonder whether it's possible for the Empire to win at all.  That being said, it's still a very fun time and a solid introduction to strategic board games in general.

So definitely nothing remotely like Risk here. Its a watered down Queens Gambit, themed instead on ROTJ. The game is really too simple and can probably be played with kids. Players use cards to pick between 3 types of actions. And then roll dice to resolve those actions.

Whichever rules clarification you choose to play with (Hasbros or designers FAQ), it doesn't change the fact that the game is a pretty random dicefest and therefore should probably not be treated too seriously. A game takes around 30 minutes.

Surprisingly good game, may even bump this up to an 8 if I have more plays under my belt. But then again, I'm a sucker for everything Star Wars.

It is definitely not Risk - this is a re-skin so it seems from an old Avalon Hill game "Queen's Gambit" from what I've read. Mechanics are solid, game is straightforward and provides interesting options while still being a dice game. Activation via the cards is a nice take/twist on strategic planning, since you can't activate whatever you want on a given turn, so you have to plan carefully and see what your opponent is up to. Looking forward to play this with my kids once they are old enough to grasp the rules.

Risk: Star Wars Edition was heralded as a successor to Queen's Gambit. It is. Kind of...

It's not as lavishly overproduced, it's in many regards simplified and the duel has a smaller impact on the game.

BUT... on the other hand it is WAY cheaper and the game can be played in a much shorter time than Queen's Gambit. And most people probably prefer the setting of Return of the Jedi to the setting of Episode 1 for a game.

So does it replace Queen's Gambit? No, not for me. But it is a very worthy alternative for everybody who is unable or unwilling to shell out the cash to acquire a copy of Queen's Gambit.

RATING: 3
Great kids game.  Harder to play the empire, but the balance is not bad.  Putting stormtroopers on Endor is a mathematically unsound move however and limits the variability of strategy for the empire.

Edit: Broken no matter where you fall on the rule debates with the designers.  Either the rebels walk over the empire every single game or if you play with the rules that allow deploy+attack the same turn as well as tie destruction of capital ships then it is a timed empire win with optimal play.

There is no point in playing empire cards for the lightsaber duel (you WILL lose) or Endor (Throw away 2 cards to delay them by at most one card?  Whaaaat??). 

The black edition is my prettiest paperweight and while I love the insert, the board and the minis, the game is sorely lacking even for my kids. 

Played a couple more times.  Empire cannot win without exploiting tie swarms-- even then the timing is iffy.  My kids are done with this game-- sad state for a Star Wars game full of plastic.

First let me say, yes I know it's risk. But it's not the risk you might remember. The game is just flat out fun. My wife and I play 2 player games alot and this game is a great mix for us and the our first 2 games have been so close, in one game all I had left was the Death Star, with no shields. and pulled out 2 sector destruction's on 2 straight turns. 

Strategy isn't to heavy but it is there, luck certainly plays a roll as it's based on dice rolling. I will say the Darth V Luke stuff feels like an add on and not all that useful, but the amount of fun we had, in little over an hour of gameplay (and that was our first play having to learn the game and all) was just off the charts. can't recommend this game enough for those who like star wars.

Rated as a filler, 30-45 minutes of chucking a truckload of dice and a few actual decisions on top. Works great for what it is. I need a few more games down to be able to say anything about balance, seems ok so far.
The gameplay is borrowed from Queens Gambit, not Risk (wouldn't rate it a 7 if it was so). Apparently Hasbro just wanted to market it to the family gaming crowd under a widely known brand.

This Risk: Star Wars Edition game lets players re-create the dramatic final moments of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. Featuring gameplay for 2 or 4 players across a TIE fighter-shaped gameboard, players can determine the fate of the Star Wars universe through 3 concurrent (yet distinct) battles. Choose to play as either the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire, and use the classic Risk dice to control characters and ships. The object of the game is to defend or destroy the Death Star. Which side will win: the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance?

I played and enjoyed Queen's Gambit several years ago and would love to have that in my collection if the price weren't exorbitant. The game clearly was inspired by Queen's Gambit but is a good deal more simplistic.  I particularly feel that the Darth Vade  and Luke Skywalker tracks are nearly useless.  It is still a decent game with a little Star Wars feel but this seems like it could have been a bit better.

I can definitely see that Hasbro tried hard to make Risk what would be considered a "good game" in board gamer eyes. The game doesn't overstay its welcome, there is simultaneous action selection/hand management, there aren't any real choke points on the map that could make the game sloggy, there's some tactical positioning on the map, and there's multiple things to do. 

However, to me it still felt like a mediocre combat game. For one, the game felt like just a constant stream of rolling dice. I don't think it's even the luck factor that bothers me about that though, it's more that all the actions kind of blur together when you're doing the same thing to resolve them every time. Secondly, while there is some hand management of which cards you play and also timing of when you do what matters somewhat, it felt like you almost always had something good you could do when it came to each of your action cards, which really lowers the stakes and makes optimal hand management/timing less important. Thirdly, the side boards. Defending the Death Star shield seems really not worth it for the Imperials until the Rebel has progressed pretty far on the track. Also, both side boards are pretty abstracted due to being just back and forth die rolls. The Luke vs. Darth Vader also just felt so disjointed from the game. It is definitely potentially important: I used my 5 bonus action cards for redeeming Darth Vader to rush dismantling the Death Star shields before my opponent could place Stormtroopers on the last few spaces, but it really feels like a tangential side quest rather than well integrated into the game.

Note that there is an errata so that TIE fighters can attack immediately upon deployment.

Surprisingly good game for something produced by Hasbro and a license property.  Simple card play where you try to advance on the battle of Endor track, Vader vs Luke track or attacking ships on the board.  

It seems the Rebels have an easier time of it than the Empire.  Goal is to wipe out the alliance for the empire or destroy the Deathstar for the Alliance.

Game is good and plays quickly in 30-45 minutes.

RATING: 7
This isn't really risk so much as another Queen's Gambit.  It has the card-order of Command and Colors.   It has the same problem of QG that only one track matters for each player, so you just use all possible orders to that--limits strategy.  Still it's got a high toy and fun factor and plays well with kids.  

It is imperative to look up the rules clarifications/changes.  The rules as written are very misleading on several important points.

There are some variants which may kick it up a notch.  I like it better than QG, since it is shorter and the theme is from the first trilogy.

RATING: 8
Similar to Queen's gambit but much easier to setup. While dice resolve the actions there are decisions to make as to which actions to pick.

Wondered if you could actually pick the cards for the other side and then they get to choose the action on them. Would soon develop a hand of cards that you don't want to give them.

First solo game ended with 3 B-Wings attacking death star and needed one 6 from 3 dice. Rolled 6 6 6.

Simple dice chucker with a Star Wars theme. Seems like the balance is in the advantage of the Rebels who have no reason to do anything other than kill the shield and end the game quickly.

Even though this game has Risk in its title, it isn't like Risk at all. As many other people have commented, it's more like the spiritual successor to Star Wars: Queen's Gambit. 

It's a lot of fun (and family-friendly), the pieces in the Black Edition are amazing, the game plays very fast, and does a great job at creating tension as you're torn between focusing on the battle on Endor, the space battle around the Death Star II, and the duel between Luke and Vader.

RATING: 6.5
Enjoyable dice roller. 

Seems to be a bit too unfairly balanced in favour of the Rebels. Options on your turn as the Empire seem limited and Rebel players will try to destroy the shield generator whenever it appears on a command card, which is quite often.

-----------

After reading the rule clarifications it is much more balanced. Having TIE fighters reinforce and instantly attack makes the Empire much more powerful.

A fun, light, asymmetrical battle game.  The battle of Endor is relived as each side is working to meet their win condition.  Components are decent, the fighters as miniatures are great.

Can be played in 30 minutes and is unlike any Risk game I've played.

It has nothing to do with Risk. It's a light wargame that features the final battle in Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. It's quite good for a game with the word "Risk" on the title.

From Risk this only has the name and some dice rolling... It's much more interesting than risk... the action selection mechanism is very good and the 3 "battle" fronts keep you engaged.
Obviously there are still huge amounts of luck involved in the game because you have no way to mitigate the dice, so there's that!
Production wise, the Black Box is fantastic... the ships are great, the foamcore insert on top is impressive... the only thing I'm not so impressed with is the card quality, despite being thick and glossy with indentations on the letters (I don't know how to say this), they seem that they can be easily marked by shuffling for example

Star Wars Risk is Star Wars but it isn't Risk but it is a lot of fun. Using card with 2 or three choices on you set up your plans hoping to maintain control over three simultaneous battles - The battle of the death star, Luke v Darth, and the shield generator on Endor. You can only affect one battle with a card, but you always have more than one choice while the three battles are raging. This allows you to hopefully react to the other player. 

Battles are resolved by dice. This brings me to a kind of neutral point. Often when I have played this the Rebels have won by rolling a six, even when for the rest of the game they have been getting pummelled by the Empire. This could be seen as thematic - an unlikely Rebel victory, good planning on the Rebel's side - you need to take down the shield generator before you can do that, or just play old luck. Truth be told it's probably a bit of all three but some will not like this luck element.

Lastly a word on the Black Edition - the quality is not what I would expect from a £50 game. (I got it half price) Although certainly better than the standard edition there are some strange choices and already some wear on some pieces.

This is a great game. It's not Risk in anything except name. It's a great, tactical 2 player game which ANYONE can learn easily. It has a combination of different areas to compete in and re-create the Return of the Jedi perfectly. The black edition is also beautifully presented.

This is actually pretty fun. Hands down the fastest game with the Risk moniker that I've come across. It's weighted a bit towards the Rebel side, but that's fine. An Empire player who strategizes well and gets some decent rolls has just as good a chance of winning. The game is still mass market though, so don't expect anything completely mind-blowing.

More fun than it has any right to be. Relatively well balanced (check the forums for official rule corrections, ignore the people who insist you need other variants). Plays quickly. Thematic, although the Vader/Luke duel isn't given appropriate weight in my opinion.

Queen's Gambit is often compared because of the similarities. That is a better game, but is also longer and more complex and more fiddly and MUCH more expensive. Risk: Star Wars Edition echoes many of the strong points from Queen's Gambit, but at a fraction of the time/money investment.

One of the best family-level Star Wars games that I've played, although still behind Epic Duels. (The FFG beasts are a different category all together.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is probably a game I would have loved as a kid. There's not all that much strategy involved, since as written, it's mainly a win for the rebels every time. The Jedi battle is pointless, as you invest at least as many cards to win that you will receive, so there's literally no reason to do it. The rebels just need to spam the generator and then spam the death star.

However, if you're a kid and really into the theme, I'm sure it could be loads of fun. For me, I'll stick with Queen's Gambit, which at least has some level of strategy.

Initially rated this a 7.5 - I loved playing it but the first 3 games ended with very easy rebel wins. The Endor track just seemed too simple to traverse and then it is just 6-hunting from then on.

However, I was taught it in a board game cafe and the game guru specifically said that the Death Star did not earn imperial reward when it destroyed a fleet token. This is wrong and this one change really impacts the game - balancing back in favour of Empire.

The games I have played since have been wonderfully balanced - yes it often comes down to die rolls,  but isn't that the best bit about gaming? Every game has been down to the wire, with each playing inching ahead and then behind, ahead and behind up to a fascinatingly rich denoument. Can't not score this a 10.

RATING: 8
Short light space shooter that combines simplification with thematic immersion. Pretty cool for what it is, but 50 EUR is too much for that thing. The material is okay but poor (thin paperback, first of all to mention), and it is tactically rather shallow. But still, it is a game I enjoy a lot these days.

There are of couple of other deficits, but for what I can say to this date (after 3 plays, 2*2p, 1*4p), I think(!) they can easily be dealt with house ruling. My main complaints: The Empire is in advantage. The Endor track is too easy. Turns out its better to simply ignore the duel Vader vs. Luke. There are a couple of very cool and thematically awesome ideas...

House rules that proved to work:
- apply semi official rules variant as described in the BGG rules section
- Duel: Each 3 or 4 hit attack gets you a bonus card
- Endor: 4d6 instead of 5d6
- Look at bonus cards before placing them, change the run order if desired

(5+ plays)  

For a fan of Star Wars : The Queen's Gambit this one has impressive visuals, and it's pretty fun.  It's nowhere near the strategy/tactics, but the risk-benefit decisions to choose the different play areas is just as compelling.  After a few plays, I enjoyed the game more and more.  In the early game, the empire is trying to decide whether to quickly annihilate as many rebel ships as possible or try to get those bonus cards from Luke Skywalker.  The rebel player has to decide if it's worth quickly launching rebel ships to keep the fleet strong, pound away at those shields to make some quick progress, or try to get those bonus cards from Darth Vader.  In the mid-game, the Empire has to gamble using turns to protect the shields or just hammer away at rebel ships, while the rebels debate the opposite.  Usually the battle between Luke and Vader is decided here as well.  The end game almost always comes down to a dice fest, but your early decisions have usually set you up for a powerful push or a high risk long shot.

The conclusion of each game board is dramatic enough to keep it fun throughout, and the trade-offs in your early decisions feel impactful - even if it's all dice chucking anyway.  With few words on any components and a simple rule set, it's really set up to play with young ones easily.

Note that the RISK name is a little confusing here.  I guess it refers to the fact that you roll d6 in combat... but no defense dice.  This game really has nothing to do with Risk.

RATING: 7
Played 3 games so far, all were super close! 

(That said, we made 2 mistakes: (i) TIEs could deploy & attack, and (ii) the empire got +1 card when destroying a fleet. Nevertheless, quite fun! And, if these make the game close and tense, then they should be house rules. Next time: I think (ii) is worth incorporating, (i) might not.) 

----

This is not a Risk game, and shouldn't have been branded as a Risk game (doesn't play anything like Risk -- plays much better!). For an asymmetric light space combat game, it's pretty good. Really does present to tense game play. Pretty quick to play and is easy to learn. components are OK quality. Out of the box it might favor the rebels, but obvious rule tweaks can balance that out.

This is a very entertaining dice-based filler game, that actually gives you interesting choices to make on your turns. The general idea is that the rebel player(s) need to destroy the shield generator and then blow up the death star. The imperial player(s) need to destroy all the rebel ships. Meanwhile, Vader and Luke are over there in the corner having a duel, and if one of them wins that duel it means the winning side gets a major advantage in the game. Each player gets a hand of 6 cards, then chooses three and puts them in a pile. The the cards are resolved one player at a time from the top to the bottom. Each card has two or three action options on it, and there are ways to score bonus cards to the bottom of your stack netting you free actions. The game is very tight, and although success and failure ultimately come down to die luck, the game feels very satisfying. Especially for such a game with such short playtime.

A decent light game that does a pretty good job of making you feel like you're acting out the three-part climax of Return of the Jedi. The gameplay bears no resemblance to Risk at all. The two sides are satisfyingly different in their goals and mechanics. However, it's very dependent on unmitigated dice rolls, so it can be frustrating and swingy, and it is easy to get into an end-game situation where most of your cards do literally nothing but you have to play them anyway. Ultimately, it's a fine game to play with kids or people who just want a very light, largely chance-based game.

[Bleack Series Edition] Good components for a fast and simple game, a perfect filler. I like it very much. Highly thematic.
Out of the box Rebels have some advantage in my opinion, but the official 'rules clarifications' on the forum helped a lot. Anyway I don't apply the 'TIE deploy & attack' rule, because after many games me and my group found it too broken for the Empire; instead, I apply a little house rule: Emperor's Force Lightnings deals 3 damage to Luke instead of 2. In this way the Luke/Vader Duel board rebalances well and Empire has more playing choices during play.

Don't know why they put the 'Risk' word on the box, because this game has nothing to do with the Risk serie. It's Queen's Gambit light, instead! It was for sure a marketing strategy.

RATING: 6
Despite the name, this doesn't play like traditional Risk at all!  Instead, the gameplay is like a cut-down version of the Queen's Gambit, moved to the battle of Endor.  However, it's missing the exciting ground battles of QG, not to mention that gorgeous multi-tier board.  And gameplay seems badly tilted to the Rebels, at least as the rulebook is written.  Despite everything, I still like the game, but I'd like it a lot more if it were better balanced.

Firstly--this is NOT RISK. Fast, fun, chaotic and just enough theme to make you want to set it up again for a rematch. It's a solid game without pretense--good filler(as good as it gets!) in between plays of REBELLION or War of the Ring.  Recommended as an introductory-level game for new recruits, or to play with the g-friend or spouse. Black Edition has a great looking box and minis--nice but not necessary to enjoy the game.  Be sure to look for rules clarifications before your first play--not errata, just clarifications to balance the game.

My wife was the rebellion and I was the empire.  She thought it was pretty fun.  I didn't like it.  I felt like the game is heavily favored to the rebellion.  As the empire I suspect you could do a lot better if you use ALL of your actions at space combat.

Too random for me.

3. (good) Play something else which has been better tested before unleashed to the audience.

Return of the Jedi in a game.  Has card play mechanic that are similar to Queen Gambit but plays quick and to the point.  Not quite as thematic as Gambit nor as grandious but it a good 1hour game to get you Return of the Jedi fill.  Heavy on the die roll and no real heavy tactics but it just tense light Star Wars fun.  The black series is beautiful and adds a little more thematic feel.  Very good game that has nothing to do with risk and should have at least had a subtitle after risk (i.e.  Star Wars Risk: the Brink of the Empire)

Que no os engañe este Risk, porque no lo es. Se trata de un juego totalmente diferente, que ni siquiera conserva la esencia de las tiradas de comparación de dados que tienen en común todas las demás versiones de Risk. Es un buen juego que recrea la batalla final del capítulo 6; destrucción del escudo de la Estrella de la Muerte en el planeta de los Ewoks, la lucha de Dar Wader con Skywalker, la batalla de naves en el espacio, y la destrucción de la Estrella. El objetivo de los rebeldes es destruir la Estrella antes de que el Imperio aniquile todas sus naves. El motor de cartas funciona realmente bien, dando una flexibilidad máxima a la hora de tomar decisiones, pero la ventaja de los rebeldes es descarada. Necesarias normas de la casa para equilibrar la balanza. ¡Ah! y se juega en menos de media hora.

05-12-2015. Rated after 3 plays. Risk: Star Wars edition boils down to a lighter version of Queen's Gambit. Both players play different sides of good versus evil, light versus dark side of the force.

The game plays over 3 battles, in one Luke tries to kill/convert Vader, vader tries to kill Luke. In the other, rebel attack the shield generator on Endor, against defense from the Imperial. The last battle is space, where the rebels try to kill the death star.

Each turn, you proram 3 cards that each allows you actions one several battlefields of which you pick one. I like this game quite a bit. The downside is mostly that this game is like QG, but worse. It's more dice rolling, less difference between the combats. It's a lot lighter and quicker though.. also less setup.

BB has decent components.

RATING: 8
Queen's Gambit is a great game, but part of its appeal is in its rarity rather than its actual quality. This reimplementation manages to retain about 80% of the charm, but for about 10% of the cost. It's a great 30-minute recreation of the battle of Endor, something that can be explained and played through in a very short amount of time. The production isn't the highest quality, but it's extremely affordable. That is, it will be until this game goes out of print and fetches over $100 on the secondary market in five years. Consider yourselves warned.

The balance feels a little iffy in places. The Rebels probably have the overall advantage, but the Imperials aren't as hopeless as they appear. I also contend that the duel section of the board is more important than people let on, but it doesn't feel very well-integrated with everything else. But balance doesn't worry me too much, as this is clearly a mainstream style game, one that can be played by anyone. As such it's a definite hit.

A very clever reimplementation of Star Wars: the Queen's Gambit. Plays really fast but still captures the excitement of the three-way battle from the end of Return of the Jedi. I own the slightly more expensive upgraded "Black Series" version, which has some nice upgraded bits and embossed cards but if you already own Star Wars micro-machines and minis, you might want to consider pimping out the cheaper retail version with those bits instead. Either way, if you are a Star Wars fan, I highly recommend it!

Not a bad little game, but not great.  Doesn't seem to have as much skill as I was hoping it would have, most of the skill is just in trying to manage your cards and play them at the right time.  I think the dice have far more sway over any in-game tactics.  I will play this with my kids or if I just want something light, but it's not as deep as I was hoping to get from what looked like it would be a "Queens Gambit" of today.  Perhaps it is, to some degree, but it doesn't seem to have the same level of "awesome".

RATING: 7
"Risk" in name only. Stronger player should never play the Rebels, real balance issues. Empire MUST deploy all Storm Troopers and kill Luke to have a chance. Interdicting Rebel fleet to slow down attack opportunity on Death Star also a goal. 

House rule: once a fleet marker is empty, it is removed from the board. Otherwise, Rebels move fleets to "safety" before Death Star can take out all the empty slots. 

All in all, a good gateway game that plays quickly. Not enough meat to attract gamers for more than a game or three, but interesting enough that one would be happy enough to play it with a youngster or a newbie to the hobby.

Adding the Risk title to this game does not do it justice. An asymetrical battle royale across three different terrains (The Emperor's Throne Room, Endor and the Death Star) that plays in about 30 minutes and is super fun. Really encapsulates the tension of the last third of RotJ. But get the Black Series version. The extra $ is more than worth it.

Still exploring this one, but so far it seems pretty tough on the Empire, even with the designer's rule clarifications. Yet to see any interesting use of the lightsaber duel track either. I think the cards have almost too many options - it is almost impossible to have a hand of 6 cards and not have the 3 cards you'd most want to play. Having said all this though, this is a great 45 minute fight for 2 players.

A quick, simple, and fun two-player game that recreates scenes from "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi."  Borrowing streamlined mechanics from a previous game release, "Star Wars: Queen's Gambit," game play here has nothing to do with its "Risk" label other than marketing--this isn't "Risk."  Though the Rebel side experiences a huge advantage and will likely win most of the games played, you can use "house rules" to feed bonus cards/orders to the Imperials to give them an increased chance at victory.

Like just about everyone, I'd heard about Queen's Gambit, but never really expected to be able to play it. So, upon hearing that it had been reprinted (with a RotJ theme), I was intrigued.

Even playing the non deluxe edition it seemed very nicely put together, albeit with a slightly cheap feeling to the board. The plastic TIE fighters are nice and the Rebel ships perfectly adequate.

As for the game play; it works really well with the three areas to focus on all having some significance (even if the central battle is perhaps key). A remarkably solid design that has held up well over the past 15 years.

It's a streamlined, faster, and more abstracted version of The Queen's Gambit.  There are some things I prefer about this one (the setting, how quickly it plays) and some things I prefer about QG (the toy factor, the greater emphasis on tactical battles, better written rules).  

I do wonder if the game was properly playtested after a few sessions.  It seems that both players can completely ignore Luke/Darth, for example. QG does a better job of giving players choices that are equally viable.

Own the Black Edition.

Wow, what a game! Easy setup, fast play time (seems like games will be under an hour consistently), simple to explain and understand, enough tactical decisions to stay interesting throughout.

On top of that, the game has a nice arc to it. By the end, the rebels will usually just have a few ships left and the Imperial side will usually be largely decimated, so it can come down to one or two final turns to determine who wins.

The best mechanic is the bonus cards. When you do certain tasks (clear all ships from a sector, destroying the Millennium Falcon, etc) you take a card from the top of your deck and add it to your cards that are in play without looking at it until it's time to activate it. This bonus action is incredibly helpful and the surprise of it is great. Is it the exact card you were hoping for, or is it something else? Love it.

It is necessary, however, to read the clarifications thread here on BGG. It contains (semi?) official rules updates that the game needs.

My only possible concern is how the balance will hold up. I've read various things about one side or the other being stronger depending on whether or not the rules updates are applied. I've seen both sides win but I've only played a couple of times so far.

Overall, an excellent light game. If you want a simple game with dice-rolling that isn't completely mindless, give it a shot.

I have never played Star Wars queens gambit and will probably never get my hands on it so having a spiritual successor is never a bad thing. The game is very light but fun none the less, and uses the star wars licence well although the release alongside episode 7 without any characters from the new film probably contributed to it not finding mainstream success (that and the fact this is not risk at all!). I would bust this out in a heartbeat to play with any Star Wars fan.

I know this is a bit of a re-implementation of The Queen's Gambit, but I was still impressed with the amount of game here, especially considering the price point and the Risk misnomer. 

I'm looking forward to another play.

When I first saw this at TRU, I thought it was a joke, but once it was explained to me that it's a Queen's Gambit clone based on the end of ROTJ, then I was instantly sold. The game depth and length are very even for a quick and very thematic two player experience. Highly recommended.

This game shall not be called Risk.
It is a completely different game from the series. The similarities are the area control mechanic and dice rolling in battles. It is a two player game and it simulates the Battle of Endor in Episode VI. In the game you can almost feel the movie as the players use their powers.

Lots of dice rolling, which I usually avoid, but there is a fun mixture of tactics and strategies, all in a quick play time. The only criticism is that two of the three battles are mostly ignored unless variants are used.

Rules can be a bit ambiguous (check FAQs in the forum). Replayability is low once you figure out the optimal strategy for each side - then it comes down to luck. Still, a fun way to spend an hour in the star wars universe if that is your thing - far more enjoyable if you play theme music in the background!

It's more fun than the Risk name may imply, with the only similarity being the dudes on a map. There are 3 different missions each player must manage, and the different victory conditions for each player are thematically appropriate. 

The game does a nice job of capturing the final battle of Return of the Jedi in a light, quick strategy game. The dice rule the game, so don't expect a tight strategic experience. It's certainly fun for what it is, though.

I want to like this more than I do, because it's a distilled-down version of The Queen's Gambit, but it was distilled down so much that there's very little strategy left. Gone are the defenses against attacks, along with any real way to defend against the Shield Generator attack. It takes less time to set up, and less time to play, so I'll hang on to it for when I want a quick Star Wars fix, but I won't be selling off my Queen's Gambit just yet.

Fast game, can easily be finished in 30 minutes, and fun! It is very thematic, and captures the feel of the movie. Basically, the rebels hang back with their fleet until the shields are downed at Endor. The Empire will try to take out the rebel fleet while this is going on, having two major assets at their disposal - the executor and the death star attacks. The fight between Darth and Luke is a sideline, but can tip the game if some attention is paid to it.

A card-driven wargame whose only ties to the original Risk are area movement and the dice.  Layers of chrome (Luke v. Vader, Death Star targeted destruction, sabotaging Death Star shields, etc) bring a simple wargame to life.  The Millennium Falcon, Executor, and Death Star miniatures coupled with the fistfuls of plastic ships of all types adds even more life to the game.  Tension builds as the game swings on pivotal moments.  A fun dice-chucker with multiple angles of attack.

A good solid dice fest.

Very simple reimplementation of Queen's Gambit.  (With the added bonus of being in the Episode IV-VI setting.)  I never played the original, so it is hard for me to compare.  This one plays in 30 minutes and works well for kids.

Played at BGG Con 2015. I played the rebels and it felt way too easy to just run up the shield gen track and then blow up the death star. Perhaps with more strategy and forethought by the Imperials it may be more balanced. I didn't find it nearly as fun as Queen's Gambit that it has been compared to so I will continue to wish for Queen's Gambit instead.

This was the last game of the night and it was perfect for that. Risk: Star Wars Edition is basically a dice-fest, but it’s not quite what you’re expecting when you hear Risk. Instead of just tromping over a map of Earth, you’re looking at a three sectioned board:

- On your left you have the Battle of Endor, where the Imperials will be defending their shield generator and the Rebels will be pushing further and further in, in order to destroy the generator.
- On your right you have the battle between Darth Vader and Luke, as you both struggle to destroy (or redeem) the other.
- In the center, you have a map of space with the Death Star in the middle surrounded by sectors containing TIE fighters, X-Wings, Y-Wings, and B-Wings.

At the beginning of each round you’re going to pick three of six cards in hand and play them into a stack. These cards show 2-3 symbols: ships (move and then attack), a lightsaber for the fight between Vader and Luke, a symbol representing the fight for Endor, a Death Star (which can destroy entire sectors containing ships), force lightning (which just damages Luke), and Darth Vader (which can be used to redeem Vader if he’s hurt enough). From there, players will alternate and reveal cards, playing one of the available actions.

The Rebels want to take down the shield generator and attack the Death Star, destroying it on a roll of 6. The Imperials want to destroy every ship the Rebels have available to them.

I think this is a solid game, nothing heavy, just a simple dice-chucking game that’s over in 45 minutes or less. It’s almost filler weight in it’s mechanics, but you do feel some meaning in your decisions.

Recommend.

Family ameritrash filler. Rebels against the Empire to destroy the Death Star in a 'loose' adaptation of the Risk dice system without a defense roll. Use cards to initiate actions and activate units. TIE fighter shaped board manages the miniature play and sub game tracks for the battle of Endor and the key characters.

[rated as a 2-player family game, or a game for adults with Star Wars in their hearts]

Had this been released in 1983, it would have been the Emperor's knees.  It's still dice-chucking fun 30 years later, as long you're even remotely interested in the franchise.

We played with the designer-approved [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1447610/some-rules-clarifications]rules clarifications[/url] from the get-go, and the balance seems reasonable.

This is really a fun little game.  It departs heavily from what classic Risk is.  Even though it is a bit scripted (not a lot of options) it still gives you the chance to pursue a couple of different strategies.  The depth of this game is not typical of a mass market Hasbro game.  The components, which seem a bit cheap, are actually not bad quality and the artwork is pretty good.  In short, they suffice.

The real redeeming quality of the game is the very short play time (unlike most Risk games).  The length of the game works very well for what it is, perhaps about 30 minutes (even first time play will be quick).  Some wild luck swings can occur, which should not be a surprise for the genre.  But with a short play time, that doesn't matter as much.  And you can come back from even bleak circumstances with clever play.  The game rewards good play, which is a mark of a decent game.  But don't look for a deep game here, just a quick slugfest.  Perfect for a quick AT fix.  This one will get played lots.

Quick (45m) and dirty fun. Doesn't seem super replayable due to straightforward optimum strategies emerging rather quickly. Definitely play with the clarifications (once you find the right ones...).

I wouldn't mind seeing some tweaks that force a more balanced Empire strategy (or a less scripted Rebel one). Although there is a impressively grim brutality to it.

Pretty balanced once the clarifications and strategies are figured out, but then there's not many choices left, just roll those dice and hope for the best.

Black edition looks pretty, made me wish there was more to the gameplay.

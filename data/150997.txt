There aren't enough choices in this game. Gameplay is: Rol dice, roll dice, move one space, roll dice. Not my style. I'll take the mediocre Descent Solo packs over this anytime.

So I gave in to the amazing deals with the Kickstarter campaign and bought this - and it was worth every penny!  I bought both base boxes plus a lot of nice shiny perks that come with being an Outlaw.  

My husband loves the game, and is pretty attached to his character - Wally the Outlaw.  All our friends love the game too.

We've printed off the fan-made character sheets and have most of our characters at level 2, if not level 3!  

Yes, a lot of the game is fighting, but there is exploration, and of course, loot!  Oh, the loot is awesome!  

We have played all the base characters, and have played various scenarios from the game, and are eagerly awaiting all the other Kickstarter goodies to arrive!

Loved playing this game.  Took a lot of time to assemble, punch and sort.  Map tiles are tough to store though.  Everything fit in the box, but one of the map tiles did not fit in the insert and had to be stored beneath the insert.

Shadows of Brimstone represents everything I thought an RPG should be when I was young; character sheets with stats, going down tunnels and killing monsters, picking up loot, improving your stats, killing bigger monsters, manuals with lots of pages.  These days I am much more interested in playing a role, which is something that adventure board games, with their linear story lines and fixation on stats, killing and loot all fail to let me do. 

In terms of mechanics, this game strikes me as essentially Last Night on Earth with added character stats.  Viewed alongside Last Night and the many dungeon crawlers, there is really nothing new here.

Thematically Brimstone cludges together the Old West, zombies and some nods to Cthulhu, so it will surely be a huge hit.  Production quality is to the standard you would expect from Flying Frog.  It is a very good looking game.  The rules are not well written.

RATING: 7
Very cool western meets horror dungeon-crawly RPG adventure game. Campaign system works great. Just wish they'd have actually included character sheets with the game instead of relying on player-created ones as the game REALLY needs it. We both really enjoy this game but feel that it's something we'll never play again; it's great but you need to play it often to remember the rules and keep your campaign going but is not something that we want to play often enough. As a result, we keep having to re-learn the rules and restarting a campaign each time we play which just makes us play even less. Sold as it just wasn't working for us.

Juegazo!! Tras varias partidas se ha convertido en mi dungeoncrawler favorito y, de hecho, ha pasado a ser, también, mi juego favorito.

The worst game I have ever played in my life, repetitive, expensive, boring, so much boring .... The AI is very poor, the characters don't have many options or decisions to make, the tiles only changes the shape but they dont have any interest (including Other worlds tiles), upgrading is very limited and random, there is only one strategy against the monsters, the town phase is the worst part of the game (throwing dice again to see a chart and see what the fuck happens with your character, repetitive, boring, very long), the exploring system of tiles is awful: take a card and search the fucking tile with nothing special, to much cards in the game, too much overproduced, too much of everything and nothing, expensive, ... 

I have played this game 10 times, only in the first game I enjoyed some, bout nothing later... Don't buy this game, if only you want to waste your money....

RATING: 1
This is the ultimate dungeon crawl. 

Things that I really love:

1.) Level up system. Best in a board game yet.
2.) Wonderful exploration in the dungeon with darkness cards, growing dread cards, the exploration tokens...perfect.
3.) Combat system - the combination of defense and armor is great.
4.) The town visits are fantastic - encounters in the city, thousand of things you have to buy or spend your dark stones/money for. Wonderful.
5.) The whole campaign system - aborted or failed missions affect the town visit.
6.) Hadrcore mode is there. Fantastic!

The only down side:
- Maybe there are not enough cards for 100+ hours to play. We need more heroes. Four heroes are not enough for 75$.

Nonetheless I was very sceptical that this game could deliver. But man - it is a blast. This is the best dungeon crawl out there easily. Descent (2.0) - pff...no comparison by any means, the D&D games as well. Even the second best Machina Arcana will have a tough time against it.

This is the biggest game FFP have produced yet. It is a classic. Right now.

BUT: FFP´s KS service is horrific. Retail customers get stuff before the backers do. An absolute NO-GO!!! Shame on you, Frogs!

EDIT Feb. 2018: Still no info when EU backers will receive their pledges...my worst KS experience so far. Time to rate this!

Kickstarter has created an environment where game designers can express their visionary games, free of publishers, distributors, and their restraints. However, restraint isn't a bad thing in a board game. Shadows of Brimstone has a hundred things going on, dozens of monsters available, a detailed system for spending time in town and leveling up, and just a fascinating number of ways that your character could grow. But it also has so many things that don't need to be there, and should have been eliminated in playtesting. There are three or four different dice systems; you might be rolling a die pool looking for a target number, rolling a single die to generate a number, rolling the number of successes that a monster rolled to eliminate those successes, rolling the number of dice that the non-eliminated successes produced to eliminate those successes, rolling two or three dice against a target number, rolling to determine a random character, rolling on a chart...it would be effortless to condense all these die mechanics into a single system, but because of Kickstarter, there was no pressure on them to do so.
These big boxes are very exciting, and the toy factor is significantly high, but I really don't expect Shadows of Brimstone to be of any significance in 2015.

Dungeon Crawler with a RPG-system of character development, set in the wild west combined with horror elements.

Pick a character, get some special abilities, weapons and items and get ready to enter the mines.
Delve through the rooms and hallways added, until you find a mission relevant thing, an otherworld portal or enemies, resolve what needs to be resolved or die trying. 
If you happen to live to tell the tales, you can go back to town, buy new stuff and upgrade your character.
Some people are bored by this, but then again, this is what dungeon crawlers are generally about, I think.

A mission takes approximately 3 hours to finish or much shorter if the posse finds a gruesome death.
The first few missions play in the mines, later you get to explore strange otherworlds of which there will be modules to be added as expansions are released.

Played the first missions with 3-4 Characters and it was mostly a walk in the park. However a few bad dice roles can make things easily going south.

I’d recommend this game to anyone who likes deadlands or call of cuthulu and generally H.P Lovecraft-Fans.
You might want to give the game a couple of run-throughs to unravel its beauty, but keep in mind that a couple of bad experiences might ruin it forever.

For a dungeon crawler, it's freakin awesome. It's kind of like a faster DnD; as events, injury, mutations, and gear affect your character's play style. The game is really tough though if you don't lose to dying or madness, the darkness track has a good chance of getting your posse. The new big negatives are set-up plus put-away and it will not fit back into its box.

See City of the Ancients (above) for general impressions of the game.

Unlike City of the Ancients, which features aliens, whizz-bang high-technology, and a wintery plateau, Swamps of death feels much more earthly.  It's got beasts, a giant demon of some sort, and lots of undead.  It's a much more traditional-feeling horror-western mashup.

Cooperative Dungeon Crawl RPG style boardgame with Old West setting mixed with C'thulu horror theme.

 +++ Great components (except Miniatures)
 +++ Campaign
 +++ Hero leveling
 +++ Good scaling amongst player count
 +++ Fun, Fun, Fun
 +++ Very thematic
 ++ Many RGP Elements
 ++ Characters with different feel 
 ++ Great AI logic for enemies
 ++ Playable Solo (and it is fun though)
 ++ Stunning artwork 

 --- Inconsistent Keyword usage on some cards
 -- Rules are somtimes not 100% clear.
 - Miniatures delivered unassambles and not that detailed
 - duration of one adventure differs much

 o Very luck dependent 
 o Feels like "analog diablo"
 o Tons of components 

A game I always want to play - even with it's few flaws it is still an outstanding game for me

Kickstarter Impressions:

I have played Flying Frog Productions games before and even own Last Night on Earth and have not been very impressed. Decent games but I felt their rules and production quality was a bit shoddy.

I went into the Kickstarter skeptical, but in the end the setting really drew me in. So unique and interesting. I backed it and backed enough to get just about everything they offered.

Initial Impressions:

The two starter boxes were huge! Everything seemed fairly good quality and well packaged. No damages and no immediate quality issues.

The Components:

Models - The models were plentiful but a bit low quality compared to what I'm used to. I would say they are higher quality than the average board game but lower quality than the average miniatures game. The decisions for the sprues and how models were cut were pretty amateur. Many places are difficult to clean and the models require a lot of extra work as multiple pieces must be glued at the same time because many limbs need to be placed inside the joining torso. The models once built have many gaps that require filling and sometimes don't even fit together right. Very frustrating.

Tokens and map tiles - Excellent! All tiles and tokens feel good in your hand and appear that they can be used without fear of utter destruction.

Cards - A little thin (similar to their other cards in games) with a coating that leaves a bit of texture, but overall very usable. The art is all nicely done and cards convey theme and information without issue.

Odds and ends - Rulebooks are paper books and work just fine. The dice are very average as well. The character boards are a little lack luster, but they get the job done.

Da Rulez - Pretty good. I would say 90% of the game is accounted for with very little question. A couple clear ups here and there would have been nice and some term consistency would have gone a long way, but I do think the game can be learned, played and taught using only the rulebook.

Gameplay - Very impressive. They managed to create a dungeon crawler that works with the Old American West setting and the Cthulhu Mythos feel. The game is not only about combat (while it is a large component) and a lot of memorable scenes come from the non-combat encounters.

As long as one person has read the rulebook thoroughly, up to five (with both sets) others can sit down fairly ignorant to the game and pick it up fast. A lot of team work is involved and there is a bit of a learning curve that can punish a team that doesn't take the game at the right pace.

Bottom Line - This is an impressive game that, while not perfect, shows that with a good idea, passionate, skilled people and the drive to make it fun, any idea can be a great board game.

One of the best “dungeon crawler” games, the rules are quite easy to learn even for 10 years old kids. If you like cooperative game, you will really enjoy this one. The campaign mode will give you a good idea of how you can improve the capacity of your hero. This game scales very well between 2 and 4 players, but solo game is also available. The pace is good and you never face the same enemies and encounters. You also have many add-on available (cards, enemy-packs) to enhance the game, but the core game content is really sufficient for outstanding time of mines and “other worlds” investigations.
The mixture of cowboys with monster/demon and travel to other worlds through portals is a really good mixture! Multiple missions are available (12 in one core game) and with the addition of other world, the game possibilities seem limitless.
I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes action cooperative game!

Here in Swamp of death core set, you have 4 different classes of hero with their own assets and specialties. All classes enable a very interesting game and can be played without being dependent on another one. This core set includes a world that looks like a deadly swamp with deadly traps and creatures with 3 specific missions. This word is stressful as half of the enemy encounter made in this world will be ambush… The quality of the figurines are really good and you will enjoy painting them if this is one of your hobby (all mine are now painted and this really improve the game play).

Another originality is the hero you play can improve with the experience you get from your adventure and becomes stronger with time, but the good point is that characteristics of the enemies evaluate also depending on the level of your hero posse! So you never become too strong and you can also get some injuries or madness that you will keep if you do not heal them between each mission. In fact the system introduces rules for sanity loss if you encounter horrors and your hero may also may suffer of mutations due to corruption damage (I will let you the surprise). A “time counter” is also introduced to keep you hero posse under stress with possible failure if you take too much time to visit and scavenge instead of focusing on your goals! The only problem you may face is that this game need a lot of space to set up an play and it is good to have a dedicated place for playing this game.

All in all, this is of the greatest game I ever played.

I primarily play solo.  This was my first ever miniature game, and let me tell you it threw me into assembly and painting head first.  I spent quite a bit of money just to assemble and paint my miniatures ($40) on paints, wire clippers, super glue, etc...  With that said, I love this game and love running a campaign solo with 2-3 characters.  If you like video games like Diablo or even MMORPGs like Everquest this has the same feel of leveling up/finding loot/ and battling groups of monsters.  As a new gamer, the rules can seem overwhelming, but once you jump in and start playing using the rulebook as a reference you get the hang of it.  The rulebooks aren't always the most user friendly, make sure you put sticky notes on important pages!

This game is fun, but it is not a good game. The design is all over the place, it feels like everything was tacked on at the last second, and it's just piles of dice chucking. Also, the components are terrible.

That being said, I did have a fun time playing it. It's fun. It's such a dumb, bad game that is somehow fun to play.

The core gameplay is quite similar to other dungeon crawlers such as descent. What makes this game rise above the others is the character progression. I love the aspect of building up your character over multiple missions. 

There is a lot of opportunity for role playing and your characters really have character development throughout the campaign. Visiting the town is fun and is a great part of the game.

The game is created with love and it definitely shows! It's dripping with theme, the artwork is evocative, the flavor text is rich and well written. It's not a very tight design though. It's rather fiddly, not very tactical and it requires time, table space and involvement to be enjoyed thoroughly. If you let go though, prepare for quite a ride! Even thinking about it makes me giddy!

Way, way too much model assembly required. I expected to see the "Testors" logo on the box. Attention Flying Frog: Not all serious board gamers have the time or enjoy modelling and painting. 
The base set has a very limited monster and character selection. I expected more from such a large box game.
As far as game play, the game is a luck-driven dungeon crawl with lots of dice chucking. Just go into the game expecting as much. On the positive side, I do like the character development and campaign play very much.
In the end, play seems rote and limited to a very light experience.

RATING: 9.5
A really addictive and gorgeous dungeon crawl with fantastic theme. Any individual game can swing a little bit one way or the other as far as difficulty, but the campaign structure is a blast and it all evens out over time. It's also surprisingly fast (and reasonably simple) for a game this epic.

Outlaw Pledge + Everything that goes with targa & jargano, minus the xxl figure, plus all the coolest extra hero minis

Think the Swamps box edges it over the City set, but only by a gnats cock, and only through personal preference.

The game is a carbon copy of warhammer quest, but with more fun, theme and randomness added. Thinking the other worlds and levelling, will lift it to another level. Won't be long now, as I have managed to get some old westerners through the first few missions! Theme comes over in spades. Not enough ranged beasts, and being tied to moving before attacking means fights are too static, otherwise an awesome game

City of the Ancients mixed in. All the other bits coming in wave 2.

Really liked this dungeon-crawler and it fulfilled my expectations for a dungeon crawler quite well (skill trees, unexplored maps, unknown monster locations, etc.). For me and my group it's a plus that it plays without a keeper. It really has (almost) all of those RPG-elements that I hoped to see in Descent 2nd edition, didn't find them there and was badly disappointed. Right now, this is my favorite dungeon-crawler and atm I don't see any contender for this spot. I am also a fan of the Cthulhu mythos and cthulhuesque settings, so that hepls. =)

This is as good as dungeon crawls get. The theme is refreshing. The dungeon generation is unique and varied. The character growth is rewarding. The components are of the finest quality. The mechanics of the game are well thought out and suit the situations. My group did make a lot of silly mistakes the first few times we played, but on my third play through the rules are becoming intuitive. Some members of my group didn't like SOB as much as other games, but in hindsight I think that came down to misktakes we made regarding the rules. Be warned, the figures take ages to glue together.

Like the dungeon crawl. Very much dislike the campaign system, particularly the frontier town visit, which is a bit of dice chucking that will likely leave you with nothing to show for the two hours spent playing a campaign scenario.

I really love this game.  It first of all is a blast, any way you play it (whether you mod the game or play it as directed).  

I was afraid that this might be a game that I would like less and less the more I played it.  However, quite the opposite has proven true.  The more I have gotten this game to the table, the more it has sparked my imagination and left me wanting to play more. 

The story it tells is fantastic. The characters, components, artifacts, encounters and items drive the story to endless and interesting places.  This is especially true if you take a time to elaborate, develop and make connections with the ongoing story being told by your party throughout your adventures!  

If you are a more "euro" gamer looking for depth, I can admittedly say the design of this game really isn't much to celebrate.  That said, if you want a meatier experience, this game easily integrates whatever mods you want to make.  Our group shamelessly has and ultimately we have designed a smoother, more "choosier" gaming experience. And dang is it fun!

If you will allow me, as a fellow gamer and friend I must endearingly say this--get over the "I have to put these minis together" complaint/excuse and buy this excellent game! :-D.  IT IS WORTH IT.

I recently was informed that when we played Shadows of Brimstone: City of the Ancients, we also played with some aspects of this game, but I don’t have enough information to comment on them.

Love it, very thematic. However, far to much bits and pieces: it takes forever to set up and break down, so it will only ever hit the table when we play at my place, and I'll only solo-play when I have lots of free time.
After two plays, I'd say the City of Ancients heroes are slightly more interesting than the Swamps of Death ones.
The Artifacts from Targa Plateau however, are much, much more interesting than those of the Swamps.
EDIT: Thanks to a bit of organising, setup- and breakdown time have been reduced to more manageable levels.

Shadows of Brimstone: Swamps of Death is a fast-paced, fully cooperative, dungeon-crawl board game set in the Old West, with a heavy dose of unspeakable horror! Players create characters, taking on the role of a classic Western Hero Archetype, such as the Law Man, Gunslinger, or Saloon Girl. Forming an adventuring posse, the Heroes venture down into the dark mines, overrun with all manner of ancient demons and foul creatures from another world. With tactical gameplay, lots of dice, and a robust card-driven exploration system, no two games are ever the same as the heroes explore the mines finding new enemies to fight, new loot to collect, and new dangers to overcome. Players can even find portals to other worlds, stepping through to continue their adventures on the other side!

Great mechanics. I love the amount of chance in this game. Very Ameritrash dicey... If the dice are hot, you're going to rcok. If the dice are cold, you'll likely die.

The art is top notch and the theme is extremely strong. I love the Weird West flavor!

Let's just start off by saying that Flying Frog is terrible at writing rule books. If only they would just include an appendix, or a glossary in this game it would have made the whole experience much easier. Things only got slightly better from there. Basically Shadows of Brimstone is the love child of [gameid=129459] and [gameid=10640], that has a kick ass outfit on. I really really dug the weird western theme of the game, and I was really excited to find out I could play a shotgun wielding, whiskey drinking, bear claw owning, vengeful nun. That is some awesome character development right there. The game plays well enough, although just like its forefather Duel of Ages the game suffers from too many stats that they used so that they could make so many different individualized characters in the game. Terms throughout the cards and rule book are vague enough that they will leave you scratching your head. Let's not even go into what a fucking mess of an experience it is going into town to upgrade items. One of the most uselessly complex systems ever tacked onto a game for absolutely no reason. 

Theme was great, but the rule and game play left a lot of room for improvement.

This is a "dungeon crawl" set in the US Midwest with Cthullu overtones and monsters. I played the lawman and by the end had two six shooters - that only had three shots each (go figure?). The game plays nearly the same as Ravenloft... Reach edge of current room, pull a new room tile and resolve exploration/combat etc. Production quality, apart from rule book, is high but really offers nothing over Ravenloft and takes at least 3+ times as long. Descent is far superior in gameplay as you are not just following pre-programmed game system.

Assembling the minis was a pain in the ass. Then, the quality of the figures is quite hit and miss. Some good, others very poor. Looking at the representations of the minis by Flying Frog, I feel that the level of detail is not the same as depicted! Therefore, they didn't paint up as well as advertised. I was planning to get City of Ancients but taking the overlap of cards and map tiles etc. into account with this, probably won't bother now...

Set up time required is pretty serious, meaning this is one for weekends only. And it took up 2 tables!

BUT - it is a lovely game to play. Combat is great - mechanics for things like scavenging is great. I love the XP and character development too. Very good, and I was playing it solo. My only fear is that the combat will go a bit flat, but I hope the power ups etc. will offset that. (A few missions in and combat is still holding up well).

Perhaps the ultimate sandbox game in my collection.  I have always enjoyed the games FFP has put out in the past.  In fact, Last Night on Earth is one of my favorite games, period.  That said, their rulebooks have always been poorly written, and their game systems too simple and/or mired in older conventions like using a D6 to determine everything from movement to combat.  Brimstone fixes none of those issues, but I love it despite them.

The reason for this is because the theme is SO strong, and stories the game tells SO immersive, that any negative aspects can be overlooked with ease.  This is a co-op RPG board game.  Taking your characters from level 1, and scraping through a series of fairly randomized missions, gaining experience, gear, mutations, madness, and injuries, is just an incredible experience.  

The miniatures are awful (though they get better as expansions come out and FFP learns how to make decent ones), the rules are awful and will almost certainly require you to house rule the inevitable questions that arise, and the game systems revolve around rolling a billion D6's each turn.  And it doesn't matter.  None of that matters in the face of the excellent stories and endless replayability the game provides.

For those who have played Warhammer Quest, this is a re-skinned version with a hundred little improvements.  If you haven't, once you have the mechanics down smooth, this game is a wagonload of fun.  Campaigns are great, because players can come in and out and the monsters level-set.  The different growth paths and the Other Worlds give this game immense replayability. 

However, if you don't want to assemble models, you might have an issue with this out of the box.

I wonder why it took so long for a board game to deliver a DnD-ish experience that's all about exploring dungeons, killing monsters, getting loot and xp.

It's been done a lot, but always felt more board game'ish. This one really feels like GM-less combat oriented pnp roleplaying game.

I'm not usually into theme-heavy cooperative fiddly dice fests with huge setup time and high production value.  But something about this game clicked.  So my rating for this game is actually pretty high, given my disposition.  Partly, I just liked the theme of supernatural westerns -- it is a less common theme and is executed in a very immersion manner.

update:  The game scales very poorly with different player counts.  With 3-4, it is pretty well balanced, and the theme shines.  It's (usually) tense, but it's definitely winnable and losses usually feel close.  With 1-2, it is extremely hard, and feel very frustrating because you often lose due to obvious bad luck with no possibility of having won no matter what you had done.

As printed, with 1-2 players: 3/10
As printed, with 3-4 players: 6/10

I suspect some simple house rules will bring the game up to a 7/10 for all player counts.  It's annoying to have to house rule a game just to make it function, but the bits and theme are so nice that it feels worth it in this case.

08-12-2014. Rated after 1 play. Dungeon crawler in which you are a cowboy fighing cthulhu-like weirdness in caves. Basically the game is a cooperative dungeon crawler. 

It's not bad, many people like it a lot. I have several issues with the game so far that annoy me a little bit, call me petty but unfortunately that's what I am.

I do not fully enjoy the setting. I think the spawning rules, in which the baddies start in a chess-like grid formation and the d6 for movement annoying. Also, beware of guns. Choose something with high chance of hitting because it'll be annoying if you don't.

So, while I do like the game to play it more, several small things change it from a great game to an 'ok' game for me. One I'll play, but certainly do not have to own.

Also, the miniatures are kind of subpar I think. They have to be assembled but are not that much better than those of say, Descent.

1 of 50 Kickstarter backers who was able to pick it up at Gen Con. They thought of everything when making this game, and you can tell the amount of effort needed from FFG to complete it.  Kudos Flying Frog, you have an excellent game here and I am excited to see where you will go with expansions for it.

RATING: 10
A fantastic dungeoncrawler with near perfect RPG-like boardgaming rules. The best campaign crawl I've played. It's hard, unforgiving, random, with lots of atmosphere and many tense moments in which each hero will contribute significantly. The box comes packed with beautiful goodies and the minis are very well sculpted in a rough way that makes them very nice to paint. The epic feel and continuity of The full game can't be beaten. You'll have to fight every meter of the way to your goal.

Sure, there are weaknesses too. It's rules heavy with lots of exceptions, especially if you mix in enemy expansions for a starting posse. Character cards immediately go invalid and there should have been blank sheets included in the box. There are counters for everything except money, which you'll need for campaign play - and if you're not going for a campaign, get another, less deep dungeoncrawler. You have to assemble the minis - but a blind monkey could do it and you'll want to paint them anyway. Also, if you're not a western fan the theme might be a little offputting until you experience how well cowboys and horror mix.

Nah, nevermind. It's a given hit for anyone looking for an immersive, rich and complex campaign with growth and tense tactical choices.

Love this game, it has  a bit of a set up time and requires some space, but the game is amazing.  You get to select from a several character classes that each have their own benefits to the group.  The length of the game is really determined by the mission and in some cases the die rolls.  I like the ability to improve my character after each mission and keep track of those improvements the next time we play.  The game characters are fully compatible with the City of Ancients game as well.  Now to be honest the game does have some limitations.  There are limited items to buy and improve and if played enough you may run out of material.  That said it leaves it open for expansions.  The western/demon theme is well executed and the pacing of the game is great.  

One big negative is putting together the miniatures.  Absolutely ridiculous, no reason for so many pieces to have to be glued together like that.  I took me hours to do and I am not into miniatures at all.

The finished product of the miniatures is great, I just personally hated gluing them together.

Great game

Neat looking game. Fun to play, but balance is awful and it needs a ton of home-made components (on the scale or practically remaking the entire game) to be playable.

The balance is truly awful; its quite easy to wind up with a party where one or two characters never even get turns in fights.

Not at all happy with how FFP is handling their KS and treating their backers.

It was just too much "meh".  It felt like I was playing a much less fun of dungeons and dragons.  I kept on feeling that I wish we were just playing that instead of this.  

I cannot quite understand why it was boring, but it just didn't click with me.  Possibly because it felt very similar to D&D, but then the character selection and customization was extremely limited compared to what you can do in an RPG.  I understand that they were trying to make a board game and selection must be limited, but I kept thinking "Well, why am I playing this then?"

RATING: 6.75
The physical necessities of Shadows of Brimstone keep this game from being the top shelf contender, but I had a pretty good time when I played.

I like the diabolic oater theme, and the two dimensional artwork is quite appealing as are the cards for the monsters. The Depth Track and Darkness events were cool features that enriched the atmosphere. I also like the way in which the asymmetrical tiles fit together and the manner in which the exits are determined.

But these gargantuan tiles--and some of these figures--are better suited for a Texan than a New York apartment dweller, and the number of card decks in play--about 15--and varied tokens and figures also require lots of space. The end result is that I felt like I spent a lot of the game setting things up and taking things down and looking for pieces, rather than just playing the game. Mage Knight certainly has lots of bits, but that game is deeper than Brimstone, where the playing (in this admittedly more novel world) is mainly straight forward moving and combat. And since most of the valuables (money & shards & XPs) are geared toward campaigning rather than one shot games, which I often prefer, this elements adds little to the adventure. I bought my copy second hand, since I am not a miniature builder, and the fragility of these figures inhibits play to some degree for me as well.

Overall, the exploratory aspect (eg. tile laying), the theme, and the two dimensional paintings make this an appealing presentation of gargantuan game that is a bit too ponderous for me to regularly play, especially now after also acquiring better-suited games like 'Perdition's Mouth Abyssal Rift' and 'Runebound Third', but I intend to try it again.

This game has a rich setting and an interesting story.  The mechanics are typical Flying Frog, which means that there is a lot of dice rolling.  There are a lot of ways to mitigate the luck of the roll though.  I'd be willing to try it again.

A great quasi-RPG that I'm having a blast soloing.  Really could use an official FAQ and some character sheets, though.  And as awesome as the Harbinger is, it sucks to have a mini that doesn't fit in the box when assembled!
I suspect eventually this'll get to be too much of the same, and the balance could probably be tweaked, but for now, I'm hooked.  Hooked enough to invest in another core set or some expansions?  Time will tell.

KS Backer - First stage reward arrived October 2014 - picked up from Essen by the wonderful Nige and Paul Matthews from Games Quest
First Wave also included [GAMEID=164292] and [GAMEID=164293]

Initially, I was a little disappointed with the quality of the miniatures, but that was looking at SoB as a miniatures game. With the "board game" head on, they're pretty good as markers, and much better and more thematic than chits

The game itself is pretty good - solo can get a little overwhelming, but i was forgetting the Revive token that i should have used. 

With five players, we had a couple of quite large rooms full of monsters on out first play-through (including seven threat cards pulled for our epic threat(!)) but we handled it and came out smiling. There's a plan for putting a campaign together, and calls for it to become a regular play, so can't be bad :)

Fast forward two years and I've just included two expansions, one of which is not part of my Kickstarter Soldier pledge:

[GAMEID=181104]
[GAMEID=196942] - additional pack

More recently I succumbed to temptation and added...
[GAMEID=181561] and 
2x [GAMEID=213560]

This is very close in spirit to the old Warhammer Quest. I enjoy bashing through this one. Sometimes the games can get a little long-winded and the exploration side of the game feels like it could do with fleshing out a little to give it slightly more RPG story telling aspects because the combat can get tiresome during long games. Overall it's pretty bloated.

I had much higher hopes, but then I am usually disappointed with Flying Frog games. 
Assembling the miniatures is a royal pain - I would have been happy with FFG quality minis without all the cutting and gluing.  
The game seems to be an OK dungeon crawl, but pales in comparison to several FFG games.  The narrative was minimal and the rooms are generic.  Mostly just seemed to be fighting random monsters until found enough clues.  Very limited tactical decisions as compared to first edition Descent.  Lots of dice rolling since you get a save roll for every hit.  
It would have been much nicer if they gave you something to track XP, gold, upgrades, stuff you bought in town, and permanent adjustments to stats - FFG routinely finds an easy way to do all of this.
AI is moronic - mostly ends up bunching monsters so you can throw dynamite.
I like the permanent injuries and madness, town encounters, etc.  It's ironic, while there are lots of rules, I found the game surprisingly shallow.

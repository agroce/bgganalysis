I really want to like this series.  Great graphics and an interesting time period.  I know I just need to be more patient, but I find the mechanics too plodding.  I believe one would have to play this game several times to appreciate the nueances.  I fear I sufer from attention deficient on this one.  I will hang on to the game for the day I retire and can dedicate more time to this type of game.  There is much to like about the game, just for another time and place..

Appreciate the research, and interesting situations.

It all works, but it's a lot of work.  I cannot put this much effort into a battle game.

The reports of the learning curve being pretty steep in this game are very true.  After two games I have been throughly beaten down.  Both scenarios were short, smaller battles, but both also contained some terrain elements.  I do not like several things about this series.  The first is counter clutter.  Almost every counter on the map seems to have two status counters on top of it by the second turn of the game--formation status, morale status, ammo status, etc.--it is so much crap that the map doesn't look appealing and it sort of spoils the imagination of the battlefield.  Second problem for me are the terrain rules.  The terrain rules are so draconian to the assaulting side that it is neigh impossible to drive enemy units from their positions.  Still, I do believe this series is very well designed for realism, I just think it might be too much for my tastes.  From what I have read on BGG about this series it DOES get better with time, and the game DOES open up once you've given it a sufficient chance.  I may come back to this series later, but not anytime soon.

03/12/11 - Update.  I came back to the system, and I am liking it much more.  See my comments under Nothing Gained But Glory for more information.

RATING: 9.5
Third installment in the "Musket and Pike" series, focusing on the french intervention of the 30 years war. Amazing series that offers really tense and exciting gameplay, with armies that degrade on cohesion and morale as the battle goes on and need to be reformed and rallied. Managing to do this while keeping pressure on the enemy and exploiting whatever opportunity arises is key to victory. Rules are intermediate complex, but very tight. Once mastered they flow naturally, no gazillion little rules and exceptions here. Some clutter on counters, but nothing too cumbersome.

Add to this tons of historical info and beautiful counters and maps and you have a winner. ULB is specially good to learn the system because of the Mergentheim scenario, a tutorial that shows you how to play. You also get three big battles (Rocroi, Alerheim and Lens) plus a grueling assault on heavily defended positions (Freiburg) that feels like World War One in the Seventeenth Century.

My favourite series in wargames, by far. It has a dedicated following, and with good reason.

Played the Mergentheim scenario as the Bavarians.  This was supposed to be a walk-over, but was anything but.  It was a tense game -- which I lost -- but the balance shifted several times over the course of the game's ten turns.  I'd play this scenario again.

Good game, very chaotic but possibly the best representation of its subject matter I have seen in a tactical battle game. The CRT/combat die rolls are very swingy as they should be for the period, command and control breaks down quickly once combat is joined too. There's a bit of maneuver and deep decision making early put quite quickly you are along for the ride with key decisions to make at certain points. Whether this appeals will vary with tastes. It feels about the same complexity as GBOH with a simpler combat system but more complex command proceedure and I like it about the same.

RATING: 8
Huge fan of the Musket and Pike Battle System.  Rocroi is the best battle in the box, and can be won by either side though the winning army will be in terrible shape at the end.  In Rocroi, either flank or the center, can decide the battle so you are actually fighting three desperate battles at once.  I enjoy the challenges posed by the terrain and fortifications in Freiburg, but I may be unique in the hobby in that regard.  Lens isn't nearly so balanced or interesting as Rocroi.  Mergentheim is ultra small, highly imbalanced, and intended as a training scenario.  I once used Mergentheim to teach the system to another wargamer with the admonition "if you lose, you have to give up the hobby."  He lost, but the cad continues to play other games.

Third installment of the Musket and Pike series, this volume centers on the french intervention in the final stages of the thirty years wars and their battles against the spanish and bavarians. This volume is one of the best ones to learn the sistem thanks to a playthrough of the Mergentheim scenario it carries in the final pages of the scenario book.
This sistem is one of the brightest gems in the GMT catalog. Very complex and prone to counter cluttering once the fighting starts, but it captures the nuances of the period brilliantly.

A very interesting game on the battles of 30 years war.

What I liked:

1. Excellent graphics

2. Very fast play when the players get comfy with the game.

3. Nice system which well simulates the battles of the 17th century.

4. Excellent rulebook. Clear and well written.

5. Excellent scenarios, one or two are unbalanced namely the intro scenario which heavilly favours the Bavarians and the chance of the French winning is very low to nil but it says that this is so in the rules but a good training scenario nonetheless. Rocroi is quite interesting with both sides having a good chance to win(the French having slightly better leaders and the Spanish having slightly more artillery).

What I did not like:

1. Steep learning curve. Beginners or non grognards can be having a hell of a time learning the game.

2. Somewhat chart heavy with a lot of modifiers. 

3. The command rules can be complicated but managable.

I find this one difficult to rate. For research, simulating this type of warfare and components it deserves a 9+. 
The only issue I personally have is that the game has a lot of 'administration and tables' while playing. Quite a steep learning curve and is not put on the table just like that. It has many different phases with action and reaction. It makes the game waht it is but is therefore quite complicated; not that I mind complexity but somehow it does not hit the table as often as I would like and I can't put my finger on it.
  
With all the status markers things get messy and annoying at first but after a while but it is clear why this is necessary and in the end contribute to the excitement and realism.

This game that needs investment and it is rewarding nevertheless this is what prevents me often to get it from the shelves again. 
 
Despite this, I think it is a wonderful experience and game series where the game flow is really giving an insight in the battles that were fought those days. 

Revisited: too many games, too little time.

Fantastic system. VERY innovative combat control system. One of the few tactical systems that plays like tactical system should:

1) Chaos; you sort of have control of your troops

2) Story: system produces a great storyline

3) Decision making: Generates decisions at the command level - you feel like you are giving orders and hoping they are carried out. Great trade-offs in the decision making - what risk/reward level do you accept and what point in the battle.

4) Drama: dramatic swings in the battle

Can't say enough good about the system (and I'm not a tactical fan...and the period is not one of my favorites). Game is on v6.0 now of Musket & Pike rules - it's done with its shakedown cruise. Hats off to the designer and developer. Outstanding.

Downside, as with anything that is meaty, the learning curve. Get someone to show the game or watch one of the many youtube videos: problem solved.

The combination of: (1) the Command/Order rules; (2) tracking morale, formation and casualties separaely and (3) the reaction rules, cause the battles in the games to play out in historically plausible ways.  Unlike in most tactical wargames, even good units can wear down after combat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played all the scenarios once each. The Musket & Pike Battles Series is a highly realistic portrayal of warfare in the mid-17th Century. The rules require a numer of plays to fully digest, but once they are mastered the game flows well. No scenario should take more than 6-7 hours even if all turns are played. The only clearly negative point is the use of large amounts of supplementary counters to indicate unit status, which does slow down the game a little. The role of chance in determining order changes and continuation attempts can be frustrating; with only 3 or 4 wings on each side an unlucky roll resulting in a failure to change orders can make a significant difference to the battle. On the other hand, this randomness succeeds in introducing a necessary element of uncertainty. 

Under the Lily Banners contains a good mix of scenarios and the attention to historical detail is impressive. Mergentheim is perfect as a learning scenario, for which purpose it was designed. Lens and Rocroi, as typical field battles with terrain playing only a minor role, are also good for novice players. Freiburg is a very different type of scenario, with terrain playing a major role and objective hexes adding to the victory conditions. Alerheim is, in my opinion, the most difficult scenario to play but also the most interesting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Best volume for learning the Musket & Pike system. Playbook contains very few extra rules and appears to be the only one in the series to include an extended example of play. The Rocroi scenario features a slug fest between two hex heavy infantry units in the center wing and calvary on the right and left. It's fairly balanced. Historically, the French won, but I find the Spanish to be stronger. 

Musket & Pike Series: In general, the rules are written clearly. There is a bit of a learning curve, but for me, most of that involved being sure that the intuitive logic behind how I would play a tactical level Musket and Pike game matched what the rules said. Any attempt to simplify the system would result in an unacceptable loss of detail crucial to capturing the flavor of 17th Century European combat. It's well worth the effort. Lots of action and reaction, musket fire and pike stabbing. Forces are divided into three or more wings. Each wing must operate within the parameters of four possible orders: Charge, Make Ready, Receive Charge, and Rally. Changing orders is a matter of modified luck, reflecting the difficulty of directing troops through the haze of black powder smoke and charging cavalry. The activation mechanics work well. Maneuvering the two hex heavy infantry units adds an interesting dimension to the hex and counter format.

This is an excellent game system which I have had a lot of fun playing.  The activation/orders method works very well in conjunction with the system's triplet of morale, formation and casualty.

Third game in the series. A nice mix of battles, with Freiburg  a bloody slugfest to the sweeping manuevers in Rocroi... 

Meanwhile my SFO comments...still apply... 

Best mix of tactical detail, command and control and simplicity I have seen. The simple command chit system forces you to plan ahead.  The game rewards the proper use of reserves. Timing is also an important skill in this game. A line of fresh troops charging into the enemy's tired and worn out formations will often  bring victory to your side.

See my comments under This Accursed Civil War (TACW) for my thoughts on the basic system.  I still prefer the battles in TACW, but Under the Lily Banners (ULB) offers a good mix of small and large engagements.  The primary factor influencing my preference for TACW is the presence of more entrenchments in the battles in ULB (unavoidable, given the situations), along with a general tendency towards more special rules, though there are never so many that the rulebook is rewritten or anything like that.

Raised my rating a point after a recent playing of Rocroi, which reminded me what a joy the Musket & Pike system is for playing out the more straightforward linear battles of the period.

Very interactive grand-tactical combat system.  The orders system and pre-emption are very well done.  Units tend to fall apart if moved too rapidly or fought too much, requiring judicious use of rally orders and actions.  The reactions and interceptions available to the non-phasing player results in little downtime.

Hull himself details where he decided not to add complexity to the system, and they could have gone further.  Yes, one can play the games a good bit and digest the rules still further, but it's the getting there.  Can we get a Simple M&P series rules, please?

I dunno...I find this cluttered and over-complicated; the problem is excacerbated by the multiple counter system to mark unit status. It is probably a fine game if you decide to invest a few months or years and focus on this series alone. Fans of the era will do this and that is fair enough. For me though, I don't have sufficient interest to take the time. The components and research are of a very high standard and I want to like this and all the others in the series. I fully understand other players giving this a good mark. For me though it is a 6.

The good :

Amazing ruleset here, clear, dynamic, really clever and polished. I love the reaction rules and the way they integrate themselves with the formation and the order systems. It creates a set of battles full of impetus and inertia, really chaotic and brutal. 

The bad :

The rules although very interesting are not easy to grasp. Often there is not much room to maneuver. The battles can degenerate into a confused slugfest that is not very exciting.

My favorite of the series, despite an affection for the Nordic wars. No salvos, I like that. Room for maneuver, I like that too. 

Played Mergentheim to a bloody draw. I as the French lost less than the Bavarians, but had to withdraw before complete destruction.

In the midst of Lens as the Spanish and am finding it a blast. Turned out to be one-sided, but still a blast for both!

I'm still learning this system--the ASL of the M&P era--but I want to comment that upon opening this box I have never been more impressed with GMT. The player aids, counters, maps, rulebook, and lovingly-crafted, historically-deep playbook are as fine as I've seen from any publisher. 

Due to the fragility of units, you really get a feel for the value of each as you maneuver it into position for its one (or two) big chance(s) to make a difference in a battle. I'm a light troop aficionado, so I'm a little saddened at the relatively minor impact they have here (dragoon and musketeer), but there is enough variety of units to keep things interesting. 

I also wish the leaders had a bit more personality, either in the form of special abilities or other powers on the field--but so be it.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] From Ben Hull (Fields of Fire). Got it, checked it out, ended up trading it. Now I kind of regret it since I think I should have a musket-and-pike game, and this one is recommended well for beginners.

New to this one. Struggling to learn it. Seems complex and really good.

Slightly difficult to master but now in my third game, i really enjoy it. It gives a good feeling about war in that era, has beautiful counters, varied scenarii.

3rd in the Musket and Pike series.  Great stuff!

A great series of tactical battles.  Tense and lots of fun to play, with a great period feel.  The rules are a little fiddly to read, but turn out to run very smoothly in play, and the complexity seems both necessary and worthwhile.

This set's a good one to start with, as it contains an introductory scenario and a couple of smaller battles.  Plus, it comes with a great set of designer's notes.

The best place to start for the Musket and Pike system. The Mergentheim scenario is great for beginners and has a valuable walkthrough in the playbook. Rocroi is one of the more managable of the larger battles. This series has a steep learning curve, but once you play a couple of  games, the lightbulb switches on and you thank yourself for investing the time it takes to get this down. Once you know the rules, you can play any of the scenarios in the series.

Rating based on a solo play-through of a scenario. I have a couple of people willing to play this game and I keenly await doing that. I really want to see how the process unfolds between two players where I believe it'll be a lot more entertaining.

I really enjoyed this game. Rules didn't seem that complex and the game flows rather smoothly. Highly interactive game turn creates a permanent tension. The topic is also rarely seen on our tables, give it a try if you can.

My first try with the MPBS series : not a bad experience but not the one I expected either, based on the very good comments here.
First of all, the system is rather cumbersome with 4 different states for each unit plus the hit markers & the casualty treshold. Even if I understand the intention of trying to simulate reality I had the feeling that it was often a burden.
Second, the interaction produces some strange situations on the board : you may charge a cavalry unit by going adjacent to it but that cavalry unit may suddenly disappear by intercepting another unit leaving your charging unit without a target.
Thirdly, the combat system is very chaotic and if can't manage to roll at least some good results it is impossible to win as the attacker. Be prepared for some hard-to-swallow-results.
Once you know all of the above (and you've integrated the system), the game is fast playing & tense. The scenarios are numerous and the developer's & designer's support on CSW is admirable.

First play with this serie. It's quite tiresome...for a final close combat very, very hazardous. Some good things, I'll see with a next play...

This is the first, and thusfar only, game I've played in the Musket and Pike series.  My commentary on this game can be applied to the rest of the series, as the games are so similar that they even share a rulebook.  I'm not nuts about tactical games, and this isn't really an exception, but it is well-engineered, dynamic, and encourages you to play historically without taking away any meaningful decisions.  I'm unlikely to become a devotee of this series, but I'm content to admire it from a distance as one of the best tactical pre-Napoleonic systems out there.

As far as this iteration specifically, there's nothing that makes it stand out particularly.  There's clearly a lot of care taken in map design and unit placement, and the scenarios seem balanced. I know next to nothing about the period, and I didn't recognize any of the battles.  I'm no Francophile, so seeing these battles played out doesn't have any particular allure.  But if you are into the subject matter, this is probably as good a starting point as any.

6/28: Played through the Mergentheim scenario since it's listed as a good one to learn the system. Next up is one with the double-counter heavy infantry. Gotta get those guys slamming away!

This Musket and Pike series gives you a really good feel for the period. I think it the finest game system GMT has. There is a good learning scenario that comes along with this game, smallish and helps you to grasp the concepts.

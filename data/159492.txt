[b]Connect 4[/b] with auctions.  A very clever mix, but it almost seems a little imbalanced with a runaway leader problem.  Decent production quality, but I hate paper money.  Glad though to see a new take on classic mechanics.

RATING: 7
Good mechanism but the theme is a bit too abstract to my taste.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My expectations of this were beyond low between the production values and actual lack of theme. Looked like something just cobbled together from spare parts. Thought it was an actual and fun game, though! Connect 4, start with money, bid to place on randomly-drawn numbers, some wild cards in the deck which also trigger payouts for your chips. No risk in trying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Very neat, it's a Connect 4 killer, the murder weapon being the auction mechanic used to add an economy into the process, with players outbidding each other over spaces and several 'wild card' types that can give you options and pay off all the players to ensure they refresh their personal banks. Great idea, this new edition looks nice and polished, I'm not a fan of paper money but it's somehow fitting to a game like this which for all purposes is a paean to the classic family board games of previous decades. Don't be fooled, though, this is tricky enough for the modern gamer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Overall, a very light auction game that combines an abstract element with an economic element.  That being said, this game is more appropriate for families/casual-gamers than me.  I find the randomness too influential.  And I don't like how players can pass the buck onto others when another player is about to win.

Takes the bidding from games like For Sale and projects it over a Connect Four board. Makes the original game just thinky enough to be its own enjoyable idea. Still manages to be rather light and breezy. Good stuff.

RATING: 8
My family likes heavy interaction And betting /bluffing games. This has a very simple mechanic and rewards patience and self - control. It was rare that the perceived leader won ; the board keeps people close. You can lose by failing to engage early. Would perhaps recommend a way to remove tiles other than 49 because you can be boxed out of winning. This is a great crossover for traditional game players (cards). It was constantly in play at the Holiday, and this from a game savvy family. 

The money is cheap, and the Banker is active. Coins or tokens would make it faster. No objections though because it added to the money feel and thus engagement.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
The auction mechanism in the game was not as interesting as I thought it would be.  The bingo aspect of it was actually kind of neat, and there were some choices to make to try to setup chances to win, along with income.  Probably a little too much on the family side of gaming to be a keeper, but am glad I got to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Auction game mixed with a connection game.  Just not that good.  I won as  my square came up and I had the most money.  If I had lost that bid, then I wait for another spot, with more money.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Has the potential to be a classic but there's a lot of snags here and there that prevented it from rising to a family staple, notably - runaway leader problem and someone has to take one for the team, lose money and drop their chances of winning just to stop someone from winning themselves, leaving other players the only ones who will benefit going forward.

2014, 2-5p, 45 min.  Bidding, bluffing and speculation game, but it has a major flaw according to some folks.  See the following forum thread: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1349447/one-problem-game

BGG user 3wGames cites the forum above and says: I cannot recommend the game.  It is fun until you get to the end and realize all the fun you had is wasted because it has a Munckin-Like end game that basically makes the entire rest of the game completely irrelevant and the winner is resolved by a simple game of "eenie, meenie, minie, mo"

I found it difficult to properly valuate the auctions.  It's definitely worth overpaying early to get pieces on the board, because the payoffs over the course of the game will add up.  And getting ejected from a space is devastating.  But overall it just felt too random for me - a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.

RATING: N/A
The game as published is much more random than I like my games - you constantly make bidding decisions which end up good or bad based purely on the ordering of subsequent draws(*) - but I knew that when I bought it. The core concept of the game is really interesting, so I'm tinkering with house rules to make it more to my tastes.

One much-liked thus far: the next 7 upcoming cards are known. This allows semi-informed decisions re: upcoming spaces-for-auction and payout frequency.

(*) = The same could be said of, say, Ra. But the hedging / risk-taking in Ra is some combination of more obvious, less swingy, and/or more interesting to me. Or perhaps it's Ra's very different bidding system.

There's not much to say about The Game of 49 - fun idea for an excuse to bid, but ultimately just another auctioning game.

While game's can be ruined by players being too focused on their own work (thus spending all their money and not being able to block a sneakier player,) I still feel there's some value to the core idea behind the game.

RATING: 3
The problem with this game is the endgame. If a winning spot for someone comes out, then they just bid all their money.  If they have the most, they win (very anti-climatic).  BUT, if someone else has more money, they are forced to jump on the grenade for everyone else to stop the win, taking themselves out, but not hurting the person who was just about to win.  The game simply breaks down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I love me a good auction game with a simple elegant system. 49 couples one with some push your luck tension. Everything is in place here for the perfect recipe. The problem however, is the game grinds out into a tactical stalemate where all players can earn equal money and a standoff occurs where the richest player waits to win. another less wealthy player is about to win, then someone else must effectively bid them out, consequently losing their own game. It just isn't satisfying to go through the whole game to play kingmaker in the final showdown.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Who'd've thought that an auction-based take on the classic connect-four would be so fun? Each token on the board yields $7 during each 'payout' so every player can benefit from acquiring any given space, keeping all players engaged. Additionally, this payout mechanic forces players to balance strategic placement, with economic growth. If you focus to much on placement, you'll be left with smaller payouts, but if you focus too strongly on pure acquisition, you'll find yourself waiting for payout cards to replenish your wealth, while watching your opponents win spaces on the cheap. As the 2017 Michigan State Champion, I certainly have a level of bias regarding this game, but this is a ridiculously inexpensive can so just go and try it yourself.

RATING: 5.5
There's no catch-up mechanism for those who don't win sufficient auctions in the first few auctions.  As a result, it's quite possible to end up with some players having no agency for the latter two thirds of the game.  That can be partly remedied by warning new players of the pitfall, at the start of the game.

RATING: 4
Didn't seem to be more than an elaborate Bingo because somebody will have to spend all their money at some point to stop somebody else and the domino player elimination will begin. That process will depend on the flip of the cards.

This is an odd duck. In theory, this is something I'd really like, as I am fond of auctions. My rating is possibly a little high, based on my feeling that this game could be a lot better than my first play indicated. We played with 6, and it ended rather abruptly. I wonder if we got any rules wrong.

After one game, my impression of this is is that it reminds of both bingo (of course, and with all the luck/lightness that adds) but also Chicago Express, the latter because there's a big element of valuing things in the auction, but how much money your opponents' have is a huge part of that calculation. Looking forward to playing again.

The Game of 49 is an enjoyable but shallow experience. It always provides an amusing moment or two as at least one player will have the burden of preventing a winner, but it can be frustrating to play thanks to the unpredictability of the cards. It's almost completely random as to whether it is a good idea to win many auctions early to build up income or to wait and save money for the more important auctions.

The whole experience is a bit of a novelty, so while I don't mind it, I don't love it either.

This was on my Essen watch list and I was excited to see it at BGG Con 2014.  I was fortunate enough to be taught by the designer himself.  I describe it as "like connect four except you bid for the spaces", in order to attract new players.  In reality it's an area control game with a smart, clean, design.  

It's very addicting and I love it.

Best way to describe this game is if Bingo and Monopoly had a baby.  I enjoy it as a fun, somewhat quick auction/bidding game.  It has easy rules and offers some good strategic gameplay.  As soon as we finished the group wanted to play it again.  That's a clear indicator of a good game.  Highly recommend as a light auction/bidding family game.  I do wish a theme was given to it rather than just an abstract bidding game.  Doesn't detract from the fun though.

Thought about going to a 9, but there really isn't anything that keeps this game from being a 10. Very fast to learn/teach, playable by a broad group of people, and the fun starts very quickly. It' s a light, fun quick game that I truly think should be on every shelf. It's not a 10 in the same way that other games are (evolving depth over 50 plays, a hundred different strategies to explore, etc...), but it does what it set out to do perfectly. As a designer, I have immense respect for that.

Wow...a deceptively simple game with some nice bluffing and mindgame layers to it.  On the outset, it seems like bingo with bidding, but it's way more than that.  Love the element of driving up a price to force an opponent to empty his pockets for a number he really needs.  And especially like the gang-up mentality that can happen as a player closes in on getting four-in-a-row.   It felt like getting a bunch of numbers first gives that player an advantage as it relates to those first payoffs, but will be curious if this is the case with future playings.

Interesting game that's more than the sum of its parts. For a game that seems to simply combine classic bidding mechanisms with Bingo, this is a pretty solid title. It has a feel to it that is similar to Monopoly, Acquire, For Sale, and a little bit of High Society. It's a nice combination, and it works well as a game for casual players. I can see why this has been picked up in a mass market capacity, as I think this is a great game for bridging that gap between modern board gamers and those who have only played Risk and the like.

[b]The Game of 49[/b] was sold via auction 3/25/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]The Game of 49 is the only game I haven't played again since last December that I really want to play again. Unfortunately this one fell through the cracks, I would have loved to play it more, but the opportunity hasn't arisen. However; after writing up this entry it put 49 back on my radar and may end up being one of my first 2016 purchases. I still really think my family would dig it and we could even play with extended family.- The perfect introductory auction game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Excellent family game that you can teach to anyone.
- Everything about the game feels familiar, so it is very easy to teach/learn.

I love auction games [i](Medici, Modern Art and Ra being my favorites)[/i] but they are not always easy to grasp for kids. I would recommend either this game or For Sale as the best introductory auction game for families.[/i]

RATING: 5
Best with 4, I think its not quite as good with 5 due to only connect 3 instead of 4. Also seems to have balance issue with regards to income from special cards.

This game was on clearance at Target for ten bucks (9.50 with the Red Card!) so I figured I'd give it a shot. I. Am. Psyched! for the first chance to bring this to a party! Darling wife indulged in 2 plays last night and tonight, and she's not a fan of money-based games...

Auction after auction after auction after just stop it already. You want to win as many auctions as possible to maximise the payoffs that come around every few turns. Of the auctions you win, hope they're vaguely close enough to each other to obtain three in a row. Then hope that a card comes out to enable you to get four in a row at the exact time you have more money than each other player - because they're forced to spend the lot to stop you winning. And if you're forced to be the stopper, then that takes you out of the running for a while, buying a dead spot to stop someone else winning, so what's the point. Not much. Auctions are intrinsically unfun - there's little cheer or groan factor, or match to theme. To have a game be nothing but auction after auction provides proof in the pudding.

4-in-a-row games:

1) Connect 4.  2P only.  Take turns to place pieces.  Can only play from the bottom up.

2) Sequence. either 2 teams or 3 teams.  Have a hand of cards. Can only play on space if you have that card.

3) The Game of 49.  A card is flipped up indicating the space(s) where you can place a chip.  Bid for the right to place a chip.  If you have more cast than anyone else, you can't be stopped when your card comes up.

simply rules that make auctions simple and put the real pressure on the players to bid wisely and bend the board to your favor while trying to secure income.  Know when to hold and know when to fold.  Game is so simple but rewards with a deep out think your opponent and then throws in an area control aspect.  Plays better with more people though as it promotes conflict. 3 might be the worst number as the 2 player uses 4 colors.

RATING: 8
Surprisingly fun given the randomness.  There is luck in when the next payoff comes, but the game feels tense regardless and stays fun.  Also good with families or mixed groups.

I like the house rule of having a 7-card preview of the upcoming.  I've heard 2 different people independently suggest it, and I agree.  It greatly improves an already fun game.

for gamers:  6/10, 7/10 with 7 card preview
for families:  8/10 (with or without 7 card preview)

Really stripped down version of "my kind of game." An auction where you are bidding for dominance on a bingo board. Neat. Too spare to ever be a favorite, but another nice filler.

Picked this up super cheap and was worth what I paid.  It is fun for one or two rounds (it plays much more quickly than the 45 minutes listed) but we tire of it quickly too.  It is only a now and again game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Light, fun, easy to teach game that blends auction and connection games together nicely. The game suffers only in the end-game - the winner is determined usually by luck of the draw when everyone has three-in-a-row and they're simply waiting for the right card.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
This game was deceivingly good as it didn't look like much.  Bidding for the opportunity to control spots on the board and get four in a row.  Very fun and strategic as to how to allocate your money and when to block other players bids.  I bought it right after playing it the first time.

RATING: 7.5
Very similar to another game in my collection (The Game of 99/5 Straight) yet the idea of auctioning off each drawn card adds tension not present in the above mentioned game. These drawn cards correspond to a space on the board, in which you must occupy 4 in a row. So, deciding when and where to bid based on your money supply and your opponents positions makes for an entertaining family or party game. A Spiel Des Jahers game it's not...but it's a well designed game with a simple concept that works extremely well.

BINGO with an auction! interesting concept. very quick abstract.

RATING: 3
This game is simply auction Bingo.

Each turn a new card comes out representing one of the 49 spaces on the board or a range of spaces where the winner can pick which one to claim.  Players will bid money on this card and the winner gets to put their color token on that space.  4 in a row wins.

There is no real strategy or thought required for this game.  In fact, about halfway through when everyone has one or two spots where a certain number will give them the win the winner is simply the person who has the most money when that card is drawn.  Complete luck of the draw, do something better with your time.

RATING: 4
An auction game where you are trying to bid on spaces on a map with the goal of getting three (or four?) in a row. I would prefer to play other auction games like Ra, which offer a bit more strategy.

RATING: 9
This is an auction stripped down to a simple "bid for placement" element, and it's a lot of fun. It's got a classic feel to it, like "For Sale," and like that game, it is easy to learn and teach. Recommended to play with non-gamers! 
Would love it if they came out with a small travel edition as it is perfectly suited for that.

It's four-in-a-row on a 7x7 board, but the fact of having to manage income and actually bid for piece placement provides enough meat so that it's not just another m,n,k game.

RATING: 5
I only have enough tolerance for the occasional filler, and Game of 49 didn't do anything special.  The bidding and "engine building" are kind of cool I guess, but there is so much randomness with the cards.  I would always rather play No Thanks and probably rather play For Sale.

This game initially looked to be right up my alley: simple, elegant mechanics, fast play time. But after watching some gameplay videos I don't see how the game isn't broken. If one person is about to win he can just bid all of his money. Another player will have to outbid him just to keep the game from ending, while getting a suboptimal spot and losing all/most of his money. Repeat.

Would still like to play this at some point, but hopefully someone will come up with a way to fix the game.

Update: Got for $6 at Target so finally decided to give it a try.

Have played a couple of times now and I have to say that the issue above is present but may not be as much of an issue. A part of the game is managing your money so that when the fourth spot comes up you have more money than anybody else and can win. The game itself is just okay. The game seems to be made for four players. With five players the game can drag and with three players there's not enough competition and the luck of the draw is more of an issue. So overall it's not bad, will have to play more to see if it will be a keeper.

Game never feels like it is taking too long, the bidding remains fast paced and pleasant. It can be fun using a pile of cash to surprise your opponent, blocking their victory. Success depends heavily on the luck of the draw, and holding the most cash at the right moments.

RATING: 7
Really easy and simple bidding game. Players bid on cards as the flip over to place their chip on the board corresponding to the card they win. First one with 4 in a row wins. This is a really good game, and has a sweet spot with 4-5 players.

This game feels like a lost Sid Sackson design. The last couple auctions can lead to a less severe Kill Dr. Lucky syndrome, but that's not a dealbreaker in any way.

I wasn't expecting much from this game when I got this from Target but this game was fun. I do have to say I wouldn't play this with less than 4 players as the two player games I played weren't as good imho. My only major gripe would be with the chips as some of them felt cheap and brittle but if you can find this on sale I'd grab a copy.

Glad I went to Target and bought this. Fun bidding game. The only down side was the paper money. Hate paper money. The new board really helps you see the spaces better. Great family fun game night game. played 3 times in a row the first night. For the price at Target it's a must buy.

The whole time I wished I was playing [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37372/game-49]this 49 game[/url] instead.

Prairie beef? Golden nuggets? Sign me up.

To be fair, though, this is far better than most mass market-y games (Sequence, Phase 10, etc.). It's just not my thing.

This is my first introduction to an auction game and I find it very enjoyable. It's very simple and easy to teach. 1 flaw is that it often comes down to having to spend all your money on a worthless spot just to stop someone else from winning.

Looks like a great holiday family game to bring out with non-gamers. Rules are very easy to learn. Dull board and components turn out to make surprisingly fun game play, but ending feels weak. We'll see after repeated playings if it improves.

Note to self: Try the High Society variant where person with least money CAN'T win. Tie breaker - win goes to person with most chips on board, followed by money.

Contains Paper money.  Connect 4 meets bingo?  Played 3 times in one day.  Once with 3 players, and twice with 5 players.  5 players takes a long time and certainly overstays its welcome pretty quickly.

Players bid on numbers. These numbers can pay out cash.  Players are attempting to get 4-in-a-row similar to connect 4, however in a 5 player game its 3-in-a-row.

Bidding is round-robin; whilst I liked the bidding and value of card placement there are really big problems.  The cards are very luck orientated.  There is no planning.  There is a rich get richer problem in the game.  It feels one player can be kingmaker. 

There is some strategy; try to get the other player to bid more and burn their cash.

I think its an alright game, but I certainly will not play it 3 times in one day again; I think its good enough as a filler only.

5.7/10

I thought this game was incredible. I was a bit skeptical at first because it looked a bit like BINGO; however, the auction mechanic adds complexity to the game. I learned how to play from the designer at Euroquest and he was wonderful.

Terrace is one of my top favorite abstract strategy games. It's really unfortunate that this game has pretty much disappeared. I love the play, I love the look, this game is awesome. I'm all for kickstarting it back up! Buzz?

Very unique looking abstract strategy game. I had the older 8x8 version with the grey board. Seen on Star Trek: TNG, no doubt for it's interesting appearance. It also plays well although with 4 players things can get a bit chaotic.

RATING: 7
The quick version is the most fun in my opinion. This was my first experience with games that look cool in progress, but not very cool if you just put some pieces on the board. There's a subtle balance that the rules impose on the positional relationships of the pieces. Go has this property as well.

RATING: 7.5
After several plays, have been having fun with this. Much more engrossing than checkers but not actually much like chess at all, as some comparisons have been drawn.  Very simple rules and some nice variants suggested here as well.  A well designed game here with robust minimalism applied to good effect.

Good game, simple rules but seems difficult to master and lots to think about. I recommend that players be of similar experience. We enjoy it very much. Its abstract nature sometimes makes it hard to find players but most come back for another game. I find it helps to think of each quarter of the board as distinct regions.

Lots of things appeared in ST:TNG that would make terrible games. Terrace has the dubious distinction of supposedly being a game. Actually, it's mediocre, not terrible.

Could very well be one of my favorite abstract strategy games.  And to think, this game wasn't even on my radar until I discovered it in a thrift store, still sealed in its original plastic wrap.  I appreciate how many possble moves there can be.  Just when you've given up the ghost, you can discover a move to get you out of trouble and make your opponent start to sweat.  Wasn't even aware of the Star Trek connection.

I give this game an 8 instead of a seven simply because my wife is willing to play this abstract game. It's underrated. It's simple to learn and the level of depth is surprising in this balanced abstract.

I would imagine four players could be confusing, but with two players I definitely like Terrace.  This one is never over in the blink of an eye, at least not when I'm playing, and I like that.  I owned an earlier edition but it was giant, so I purchased one of the later editions with the gray board.  I've never tried the 6x6 edition.

The two player game is drawish. In fact, keeping your 't' piece on the high ground prevents one of your opponent's two winning conditions: the piece's capture. Your opponent's only alternative is to try to move his 't' to the low spot, and I'll bet that's also preventable. With more players, an opponent may be able to slip the 't' behind several blockading pieces for the win.

RATING: 5.5
A nice idea in that capture is by a higher piece moving diagonally down onto a lower piece. Other than that, there's not a lot here. It is too hard for a single piece to threaten more than one other, so the game doesn't progress very well.

RATING: 8
Rating is for the 2 player game. With more players, it shines a lot less. The game is a solid abstract. With all pieces having the exact same movement it's quite easy to read-ahead, so this game will appeal to fans of chess or checkers. At the same time it's quite difference since your pieces gain in power as they climb up the terraces. This is another great example of a "few minutes to learn, years to master" game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Didn't actually remember how intriguing this abstract is. A real good offense / defense system whereby you must constantly try to keep on the offensive to keep the upper hand (much like chess). Seems easy right from the beginning but slowly evolves into a real challenging abstract. I'd say this is up there with some of my favourite abstracts. It's obvious the rules weren't just written for the sake of a game; they were carefully thought out to make a solid abstract. Only four moves can be made, but two ways to win help keep the tug-of-war consistent throughout.  Plus, its futurism look just adds to the whole experience. GIPF series games might be purer, but rarely does a 3D game like this (that uses the elements of 3D in a brilliant way) come out so well.

I've owned 2 copies of Terrace.  The first one I traded (unopened) to a fellow BGG and the 2nd I just picked up for a couple of bucks from a fellow I occasionally game with.  I'll keep this one awhile.  My game group on Mondays are a bunch of (mostly) chess players who enjoy abstracts...we've delved into Blokus and Ringzz.  This is another neat abstract that plays 4 players that we could explore.

I don't remember how we got into it, but a friend and I played the hell out of this game sometime in high school. We signed up for the "Terrace Times" newsletter and even came up with varriants of the game and sent them in to the creators/publishers. To this day I have a hand-written letter from one of the game's designers where he responded enthusiastically to our variants.

There is a version of this game floating around out there somewhere with black and white pieces (and maybe a different sized board?) that I would LOVE to get my hands on.

RATING: 4
I read the rules and did some play testing. The game seemed like it could bog down if you play it to seriously. You try to challenge a player, but they can often counter the move. There was some trapping possible so maybe a more complex build up is necessary. It also seemed easy to protect your T piece initially, but then at some point you would need to try to get it to the other side which would be challenging. It also seems like this game could easily end in a stalemate. It seemed to work best if you mostly ignored each other and tried to get your T to the other side. I would rather play chess.

RATING: 7
I own both the original (larger, plastic) board and the updated (smaller, foam) versions of Terrace. They're both good as two-player games: the larger board makes for deeper game play but longer (sometimes unpleasantly drawn out) games. The smaller board makes for quicker game play; I usually prefer the small board. Four player is humorously chaotic on the small board but still a respectable strategy game on the large board.

RATING: 7
Eccentric abstract in which a small stone needs to cross a saddle-like board to its opposite corner without being swallowed up by bigger ones. Terrace is quirky but only relatively deep, and after a couple of rounds the player's already assimilated the movement of the pieces and the way the board conditions the strategy to follow; planning some moves ahead isn't tiresome at all. Unfortunately there seems to be no rule against stalemates, which can obviously happen...

For two players it's funny and rather replayable - and overall very pleasing to the eye.

So far really fun with the guys at work.  It's the type of game that leaves you thinking about different strategies, and what you could have/should have done to influence the outcome.  For some reason, I have an aversion to chess, but this game is nicely designed and has a cool feel to it as you climb up the terraces to gain higher ground on an opponent, or decened in an effort to get your "T" to the other side.  My rating will most likely go up unless I burn my brain out on this game and can't post anymore. :P

It's a pretty good abstract game of position, and looks pretty cool, though dated now.

This is a provisional rating based on my vague memories of playing my friend's copy back in high school. I recently purchased my own copy, but have yet to try it out again.

I found this to be a solid abstract strategy game.  I haven't encountered the stalemate issue that others speak of, but I've probably only played this about 15 times.

A 2 or 4 player apstract on a tiered 3D board.  Not especially engrossing.

I think I've played this once or twice. Nice board though. On the box they call it "the purest strategy game"--they must not have run into anything more pure than, say, chess.

RATING: 7
Nice abstract. Simple rules, but terraced board and subsequent movement rules make for unique gameplay. So far I've only played the short game...

Used but playable condition.  Box is indented on top due to poor Goodwill shelving.

Only played once, but I loved it.  Lots of strategy here.  Has one of those things I love when I play a game.  Sounds easy and like it won't be much fun, and then turns out to be more of a challenge than it sounds.  Elegant!

My wife likes the board and pieces and has expressed interest in learning to play, I enjoy it alright.

I'm sure there's a game here but one play didn't grab me enough to get a second play.

a fun light abstract with interesting movement and capture rules.  Slightly broken with 3 players.

Interesting for a few plays, but for the past ten years or so: just taking up space.

Pure abstract strategy for when you're tired of Chess or Khet.  Hey, this game was featured on the original Star Trek program.

Very close to the perfect "heavy" abstract game. There's just a slight problem of stalemate near the end.

Nice strategy game.  Causes some cool thinking.  Not very exciting.

RATING: 3
Interesting abstract game with a great 3-D formed plastic board and pieces.  The rules for movement and capturing are really unique, but games with 3-4 players can lock-up with a lot of cat and mouse chasing.  Only play this with 2 players.

fun abstract game for two - a little chaotic with 4.

A game titled "Terrace" should be packaged with plants, a watering can, and an HD video of a hot neighbor who likes to undress in front of an open window.

Please understand that this comment has been carefully structured so that either male or female undressing might be inferred. No neighborly sexism is intended or implied.

Don't even bring up [i]Body Double[/i].  I wasn't thinking of that movie at all.

Ok, maybe a little bit.  And now I can't get that Frankie Goes to Hollywood song out of my head.

I'm fairly certain the ward supervisor is coming, so I'm logging off now.  Just as soon as

Fun abstract.

The extra dimension really does mess with your head. I've found that typically the newbies almost always win against the people who have played a few times and think they know what is going on. 

The initial instincts that an experienced gamer may have for this game are probably wrong.

After 1 Play: Interesting game, looks great.  Games seem to stretch a litle too long, and I find the endgame rather anticlimactic.

Fun game but it is to easy to play a stalling game and realy drag things out.

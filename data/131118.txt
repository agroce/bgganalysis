This game is quite complex, with a lot of rules.  This tends to make it feel a bit dry and fiddly.  It feels like something is there, I'm hoping further plays will show what I'm missing.

RATING: 7
Enjoy this game but it's a real bear to teach, and the rules overhead is pretty rough for something that doesn't hit the table very often. We basically have to relearn the game every time, and thus we never play it. But the game is a ton of fun once you get past that. Very tense and interactive worker placement with a great theme. The head to head nature of the battles makes for some really interesting stuff.

RATING: 5
Rated 6 based on initial play. Game is beautiful, but the game itself felt pretty anticlimactic. 5 rounds passed very quickly (nearly quicker than setup:P). I think we messed up a couple of rules (there are updated rules on BGG which I need to dl and read). We will fix these and try again.

Note: this is based on a 2 player rating (and I seemed to be interrupted every 5 minutes during game so was hard to get into it). Once I iron out the rules I will try to get this played with 3 or 4 and see if it improves.

RATING: 6
This is actually a very solid worker placement with some cool unique mechanisms -- you can get a ton of workers but there are multiple actions that lock them up permanently, for one.

Biggest complaint is the art for the Norse Gods: it's a very strange and offputting cartoon style. The rest of the art on the board is quite good, though.

RATING: 6
1st play: Like many 'What's your game' titles, this one is a heavy, complicated game.  Tons of moving pieces and interconnected mechanisms made it hard to see the path to what the end of the game looked like.  I really enjoy the theme, and I think that with a couple of plays it could really come alive.  As it stands now though, a lot will depend on how smoothly it plays on the second try.

2nd play: The second play was much smoother and much quicker than the first. Ragnarok was cool and tense, with high stakes reveals. There are a ton of moving pieces and I'm still not sure I figured them all out. The theme might be enough to get this to the table again soon, but time will tell.

I was heavily involved in play-testing Asgard, after being slightly involved in OddVille and Vinhos as well. By now, I love this game, its exciting anew every time. I love how you can really turn the tide in every game again, and are not fixed on 'one way wins everything'. I would recommend this game to everyone who wants a fast and challenging game which is not won by pre-defined strategies but keeps you busy adjusting to the other players as well.

Ενδιαφέρον eurogame βασισμένο στην σκανδιναβική μυθολογία. Υπάρχουν καμιά δεκαριά θεοί (Θορ, Όντιν, Λόκι, κτλ) από τους οποίους μαζεύουμε runes χρησιμοποιούμε τα abilities τους, συγκεντρώνουμε στρατό και τέλος χτίζουμε ναούς δηλώνοντας έτσι ποιους θεούς υποστηρίζουμε.

Υπάρχουν στο παιχνίδι και καμιά δεκαριά θέσεις/πλανήτες στους οποίους πηγαίνουν και μάχονται οι θεοί μεταξύ τους. Σκοπός μας είναι να κερδίσουν την τελική μάχη(Ragnarok) οι θεοί που υποστηρίζουμε. Για να τους βοηθήσουμε μπορούμε να τους δώσουμε artifacts μου βρήκαμε κατά την διάρκεια του παιχνιδιού αλλά και να παίξουμε κάποια spells στην μάχη.

To παιχνίδι έχει πολύ σφιχτό gameplay και τα actions δεν σου φτάνουν ποτέ. Ο κεντρικός μηχανισμός είναι ένα κάπως περίεργο μείγμα από worker placement και ταυτόχρονο action selection. Ουσιαστικά ο κάθε παίκτης επιλέγει ταυτόχρονα και κρυφά (διαλέγοντας κάρτες) σε ποιους θεούς θέλει να κάνει action και μετά βάση turn order ανοίγουμε τις κάρτες (μια την φορά) και τοποθετούμε τα δισκάκια μας.

Να σημειώσω πως οι θέσεις σε κάθε θεό δεν είναι ισάξιες. Υπάρχει μια θέση για resources + abilty δώρο, μια θέση με σκέτα resources και μια θέση για κατασκευή ναού. Συνεπώς δεν φτάνει μόνο να επιλέξεις τους θεούς που σε ενδιαφέρουν αλλά πρέπει να ανοίξεις και τις κάρτες σου με τη σωστή σειρά για να πάρεις όσο το δυνατό περισσότερες καλές θέσεις. 

Το artwork είναι καρτουνίστικο και θα το χαρακτήριζα απλά συμπαθητικό, τίποτα το ιδιαίτερο. Κανένα παράπονο από την ποιότητα παραγωγής, κλασσικό παιχνίδι της What's Your Game. Μας πήρε 2,5 ώρες για μια πρώτη παρτίδα με 4 άτομα.

Γεμάτο παιχνίδι. Μου άρεσε που στο τέλος που γίνονται οι μάχες και στη μια μάχη μπορείς να είσαι σύμμαχος με τον Χ παίκτη εναντίων του Ζ και Υ παίκτη και στην αμέσως επόμενη είσαι παρέα με τον Υ εναντίων των Χ,Ζ και πρέπει να αποφασίσεις που θα παίξεις τα spells και τα artifacts σου

I really like this game. On the first play through you only really focus on the special powers of the gods as individuals. However after several play throughs you start to see the push and pull between the light and dark gods and how they affect the battle of Ragnarok.

No rating here because it never got played. We picked this one up for next to nothing from the virtual flea market at Dice Tower Con 2015. But after getting out ALL those components and trying to go over ALL those rules we quickly realized that this Euro is way too heavy for us. Probably should have known when we saw that the publisher was "What's Your Game?" They make nothing but heavy Euros. Nice art style at least.

I had high hopes for this game.  Vasco da Gama was excellent and Vinhos were very good.  WYG produce games at the heavy end of the Euro-scale, are well developed and Mariano Iannelli's artwork on the game pieces is as good as it gets.  I expected a relatively complex game and am happy with that.  The rules took a good 90 minutes to absorb and explain.  The relationship between the various pieces took a little absorbing, but all made sense.  However there were two big negatives for me.  Firstly, if there are no enchanted stones left then you take one from the opponent with the most.  However on most occasions there was more than one equal, so you had to choose.  Direct negative player interaction as its worst.  As your opponents are likely to have required the stone to purchase a temple and you will likely to be scuppering their chance of doing this.  Add that to the frustration that the temples are quickly bought, you are constantly being frustrated and needing to change your plans.  Both these negatives could have been addressed in the design process.  Maybe the stones could just be retained for a limited period, or indeed more stones included removing their limited nature.  The temple types could have been more limited to allow tiles with the same costs in different piles, with maybe some variations or bonuses thrown in.  It feels like a 3 to me at the moment, but I really want to reward the production and positive aspects more.  But sadly I'm not expecting any of my regular group to want to try this again.

This is a brain burner! I found the first play through quite hard, so many inter connected actions leading to the final scoring round, nicely themed as Ragnarock. This is another classy game from WYG and one I want to play several more times to delve deeper into the strategies.

Essen 2012: First play. I watched the demo video and read through the rules pre-play. The structure seemed simple enough but the complication of the Gods various actions (10!) and the three sub-sections of choice for each God and a couple of pages explaining tile and bonus effects had my head spinning.

This wasn't the easiest game to explain seeing how I hadn't played before and my three other players were groaning before the game started. 

The game has some moments where the lights go on and you appreciate there is alot more to consider than the rules prepare you for. Turn order is crucial and the need for fluid options sometimes leaves you in the lurch. There are plenty of oportunities for screwage.

All builds to the last big battle for Ragnarok and its then you appreciate that this is the main event to have been planned for, and none of us had properly. Some of the tiles have fiddly rules and we all made silly mistakes.

This is definitely a game where the first game must be written off as a learning experience. One of our group swore never to play again (and she won), three of us really liked it, and two are keen to play again soon. This is a game where experience will count for alot. It will be interesting to see how the second game pans out.

Second Game: It all makes sense now. A really clever game and a definite keeper.

The rules are a bit clunky and not that easy to grasp but the gameplay is quite original. It is a fusion between action selection, worker placement and a sort of market shares management (supporting gods is quite like buying shares of a company you think will be more valuable), with the main scoring path quite balanced.

Area control games are not my favorite, but I like this one because your area control decisions are also heavily influenced by the special powers of the god spaces, the set collection required for building temples, and the sheer availability of each spot. It makes for a tense, if a little long and repetitive, game.

I have never tried this with only two players, but it seems like it wouldn't work well with less than three considering you sometimes have to "team up" to stop someone who is dominating in some areas. Cool art, cool theme. Very confusing scoring, particularly at endgame.

While the game is actually not that hard to understand, we had a hard time learning the game (I normally explain the rules to my gaming groups as that’s the way I prefer to learn rules; by reading them myself instead of being taught). This meant that it was a little hard to understand what to do in the beginning, and at the end game scoring we still missed a couple of rules (well, we did play by the correct rules, the players except the game owner just forgot about them). 

Despite of this I still enjoyed the game a lot and am seriously considering purchasing the game. I liked the mechanics a lot! There is a little meta game going on as you need to figure out which cards the other players are going to play. There are a couple of very different ways to score victory points which is a big plus (I cannot comment on the balance of these as I have only played the game once). I liked how the gods had to fight in the end game scoring and how you should place tiles to support them.

*6* (3+ Plays)
Unlike anything I have played for a Euro type game. Very difficult game to learn from the rulebook with some overly complicated gameplay. Quite aggressive game, and very engaging with amazingly hard choices with which gods to influence, and when. I definitely think this is a better 3 or 4 player game, 2 player is kind of predictable and doesn't have the same level of engagement. It is a heavier game that is prone to some AP and runs too long. There's a  large swing of points at Ragnarok that most likely will dictate the winner.

Update: tentative 8 --> strong 9
This game seriously rocks. It's a bit on the long side (for me), and does have a bit of AP (or AP folks experience a bit of AP, depending on how you look at it), including me, but there is such a nice multi-dimensional path to VP (without feeling like a Feldian VP salad), with actions that result in lots of indirect pressure being applied to other players, without devolving into direct conflict between players. But most of all, simply very unique in both theme and mechanics. The [i]only[/i] caveat that I can think of is that there is a bit of randomness in the combats, but it's [i]easy[/i] to mitigate with even moderate preparation. And the other thing is that players select the set of actions they will take for the round simultaneously. This can and does result in a game of chicken, with people often colliding. But it's not a complete bust when that happens, and again there are ways to mitigate. Ok, one more: the final battle of Ragnarok has a bit more randomness, and it's the final result, so way to react to it. It's a question of how much risk one is willing to take in spreading themselves thin vs hunkering down to more securely win fewer battles. Can the randomness of the final battle determine the winner? I think so--not often, but occasionally. But I don't care; it still feels epic.
--------------
Very surprised. I got this on a whim. Fantastic game. Why is this not more popular? This seems to have everything going for it, including fabulous production. There's a moderate dose of randomness at the battle stage, which may turn some people off, and there is simultaneous action selection, but it's with a very nice twist. You have workers, and all players have a small deck of cards that correspond to each place you can put a worker. Then each round all players simultaneously select a set of cards (equal to the number of available workers) which corresponds to the actions that they [i]want[/i] to take. But then in turn order each player only plays one of their selected cards, and puts a worked on the appropriate spot. Each spot has room for a few workers, but there are important differences between the workers spaces at a single location. After all workers have been placed, again in turn order players take turns resolving one worker. After each round there is a battle sequence that players are jockeying for during each round, but then at the end of the game there's an uberbattle, nay, Ragnarök!!! I need to write a review. This game deserves more attention.

After 1 play, I'll give it an '8', but that could easily go up or down.

Asgard is a difficult game. Even after grasping all the rules, it was not at all immediately clear what sort of strategy to pursue... or even what moves to try for the first turn of the game. (I view this as a positive thing.)

The brain-burn on this one is pretty steep and the game is very tight, with limited time (only 5 rounds) and resources. There are many interlocking mechanisms and a significant need to plan from the beginning for the final scoring (the great battle of Ragnarok). Trying to get all these things to work together is a real challenge... sort of like the way I felt after my first game of Agricola (which I now love).

My brain hurts, but I'm eager to try this one again.

EDIT: Played again... definitely a gamer's game and I think I'll stick with the '8'. Asgard was a bit better with 4 players, but the 2 player game worked really well, too. Quite a lot of setup to this one.

I'd have to play it again to see if it improves, but first play felt extremely chaotic.  Stuff getting swapped around during mid round.  Some take that stuff going on.  And how you fare in the final battle is very deciding in overall points.  The final battle may improve with more plays, but the first play was random and chaotic.  It did have some good theme as the board and cards were illustrated nicely.

I think the game was clunky but fun. I think this game could be smoothed out. Drop phase one. The art was wonky and the component feel kind of cheap. 

There is a decent game underneath the rough edges. The whole game builds up to an epic finale, Ragnarok.  My girlfriend really enjoyed it (that's why I am rating at a 6 instead of a 5).

I would not recommend this at 2 players.  I think Ragnarok would be more interesting at 4 players.

Ein Spiel, das ein wenig an sich selbst scheitert. Oder ich an ihm. Leider. Thema nordische Mythologie ist prima, die Gestaltung üppig, doch ASGARD verzettelt sich. Vor allem in der überbordenden Schlussabrechnung. Hier hat der Autor die Kontrolle über sein Werk verloren und ist ihm über die Birne gewachsen. Rauch steigt auf. Dabei ist der Aufbau sehr strukturiert, fast schon schubladenkastenartig. ASGARD bekommt dennoch meine Sympathie, obwohl ich es gerne lieber gemocht hätte.

Intricate rules. Complex gameplay with a lot of choices, but also lots of untypical situations to handle. Thus, the game is hard to learn and to teach to new players. Besides, it is very hard to learn from reading the rulebook only. You will usually  have to play several sessions before being able to play Asgard fluently. That is the main drawback of the game.

Many components to sort before playing. As a consequence, the set up can take a long time.

Asgard would have been a interesting and valuable challenger to Agricola... but the big drawbacks listed above are too much to handle for my gaming group.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Solid action selection with a very fun theme. The artwork is gorgeous, though I would've preferred the gods being slightly less cartoony. The game itself is packed with hard decisions and interesting effects, but for a game that's centered around 'combat' there's actually very little direct player confrontation - a 2 player game may not even involve much blocking. I'd say it's probably better with more players. The game feels just a tad too short - even without player interaction, it seems like five rounds doesn't quite give me the amount of time I'd really like for a good build-up. Also, the rulebook is sadly very poorly formatted and strangely written, which considering the complexity of the game, makes rules questions a constant plague.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Surprisingly good game with somewhat weird but pleasant art. It is basically worker placement (preceeded by a simultaneous action selection step), and the actions are quite simple, but there are many, many things to consider.

Building temples and participating in battles are the means to gain victory points during the game, and they prepare you for the Ragnarok in different ways, but they also cost you valuable influence discs (your "workers"). I like how the battle resolution that happens each round is different from the Ragnarok at the end, but the points from the latter are decisive and there may be a bit too much hidden information in it. However, that and the out-of-place negotiation that is tacked to one of the actions are the only criticisms I have to the gameplay.

This is undoubtly a gamer's game, very brainy and engaging, with just the right amount of theme for a Euro. There are various strategies and they seem pretty well balanced.

I am not sure why the BGG rating of this game is so low. I do like other games that have a low rating but I usually understand why they are rated so.  Here, we've got a solid euro design, on the heavy side, with a theme that does not feel too pasted on.  The kind of game you would expect to reach the top 50 at least and then slowly sink but stay in the top 200.
The only problems I have with this game :
- it is not suitable to play with the AP-prone...  like most thinky games really
- newbies get crushed because playing suboptimally, even in the first round, is fatal
but these problems are not specific to Asgard.
- rules are poorly written and formatted: this is the most probable cause for that low BGG rating.
So to me, Asgard is a very good, heavy euro game with some interesting and interlocking gears.

Well at the rules explanation which was so long i got bored of it already. I tought this will be one hell of a complicated game but for my surprise it's not. I don't say that the actions makes sense but they are bordered well to about three main categories as the followings are gaining resources, building a temple, gaining meeple and more workers. You are trying to build up a small empire to score points in numerous tracks by sending people to the main tree and make a fight, or to buy buildings which also scores every turn. The game somewhat feels chaotic and hard to follow the components are a bit lower quality like the tokens in Castles Of Burgundy. There is a big element of luck in the main tree fighting zone. However on the other hand the theme and gameplay is original while there is big player interaction which is also a big plus. Im pretty sure i won't buy it but i would play it again if im asked to. There are a lot of better games than this but to play it occasionally it is enjoyable.

A somewhat unusual action selection/stock game.  Players enlist the aid of the gods in order to prepare for the final battle.  The game isn't actually very complicated, but it's a bit tricky to pick up at first. The way the tokens are used is intriguing. (1 play)

Really fun and unique game, and one that more people should be aware of. Although since it's not so in demand it's unbelievably cheap on Amazon, I paid around $20. The core is sort of worker placement, but with a twist. You pick out all of your cards simultaneously in secret and then in turn order reveal one and place your worker in one of the spots that card corresponds to. All the cards correspond to three different spots on the board plus they can all be used to go to Asgard, so you can adjust on the fly if someone does something to get in your way. The best part is how every action does multiple things and so you have to balance what's most important. You can take the better resource for which temple you're trying to build, but that comes with a special bonus power that maybe won't help you as much as some others this turn. And similarly when you build a temple to a god you get to commit it to a battle. You want to pick a battle you can win and get good end game points for, but you also want to get a good immediate bonus. These kinds of multifaceted decisions are my favorite. And the end game scoring of Ragnarok is really unique. You can collect weapon and sorcery tiles all game and at the end you go around committing them to gods you've backed, but you put them face down. And then they all get revealed and the end game battles get resolved for some big points. Really fun game.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2016)

What's Your Game? Is the only publisher that hasn’t let me down with any of its games (yet), so I was very keen to play Asgard and I’m glad to report it is a good game.

The rules are more involved than the average game, but they aren’t complex because they are hard to grasp, they are complex because 1. There are many rules and 2. They could be a lot clearer in the rulebook, but when you begin playing, they make sense and the game flows easily. Asgard is a medium weight game.

The game components and art are ok.

The theme is enjoyable and, more important, you do feel it through the game. The game mechanisms support it and that’s a weird thing to have in an Euro Game.

The game decisions aren’t obvious in any way (which gods to activate each turn?, do you get the resources?, do you build a temple?, do you participate in a battle? where to fight?, which card to play if your opponents play X, Y, Z?). So far, it seems it has many paths to victory.

Asgard is one of those games in which you wish you have more turns to play so you can accomplish more, that is, you have to do a lot with very limited resources.

It has a single element of negotiation that seems weird (perhaps out of place?) but I kind of like it. When you play a particular god, you  can re arrange the player order and other players can give you warriors to convince you to give them the tile they want.

On the bad side, I’m worried about the luck factor in the battles. There is some luck here but I feel you can mitigate it with proper planning, however sometimes it can help you or hinder you no matter what. On the other hand, I’m much more worried about possibly "king making" situations. The game lends itself to attack the current leader (a thing I’m disliking more and more over time), but as there are hidden VPs, players can’t gauge who is winning accurately, besides a lot of VPs are awarded in Ragnarok, so if a player attacks/blocks another player (by building a temple and choosing a god to play in the same world), he could give the game to a third player who never encountered this kind of resistance, perhaps it is best with 4 players to avoid unbalances (I have only played it with 3). I’m not sure if this happen a lot but it was the case in our game. However these are minor issues for me, I enjoyed the game a lot and it is an unique euro game.

Bottom line, Asgard is a true gamer's game and an underrated one. I´m not sure why this didn’t get more publicity/attention, but it is a good game. It has a high probability of getting an upgraded rating from me. I want to play it again soon as I feel there is a lot to explore.

I still haven’t played Asgard again, yet, I’m upgrading its rating because I’m thinking about the game often and my desire to play it again has increased a bit over the last couple of months. I need to lay Asgard soon!

Now, I've only played the game once, but it feels like 90% of the game is build-up to the über-scoring of the Ragnarok, which would be fine if it wasn't so (1) random, and (2) unexciting. Some really cool concepts, both mechanically and thematically, but overall, feels like a long walk for a short drink of water.

A pretty good worker placement game. I like the subject matter but am not so fond of the graphic design and art style.
Worker placement is a mechanic that creates tension and meaningful decisions through properly evaluating timing. Asgard takes this up to eleven. There are so many things to go for that you have to choose a target and stick with it. In the latter rounds you might pick up some random leftovers but going for a general approach... very ill-advised.

Played once, 4p. I hated this during the game, as I could not grasp the strategy and all the rules. After I lost, and I started to piece the ending together, I could see how we wound up where we did, and a better idea of my mistakes. So this is probably worth a look, but the rules are VERY dense.

RATING: 5
Sold my copy. I can appreciate WYG titles and their mashups of mechanics but I tire of relearning a game and the challenge of teaching many of their games. This is a fine game, but I sold my copy. 

FIRST IMRESSION: 

This is a typical What's Your Game production in that there is a significant mish-mash of mechanics which makes the game feel far more complex than it really is.  This means the game is difficult to teach/play that first attempt.  There is significant player interaction and screwage that can and likely will occur in this game both in timing and battles.  To make things both more interesting and challenging, there is a final battle (Ragnarok) where significant end game scoring can occur and player conflict can abound.  One must invest in building temples in order to compete in the final battles in Ragnarok (temples also score you points during the game each turn).  Futhermore, workers used to build temples or fight in the skirmishes during the game are unavailable for use the rest of the game so you must hire additional workers from Asgard.  There is some randomness and chaos in this game which can and will frustrate people.

RATING: 5
Draft and use actions and resources to end up on the winning side of Ragnarök.

Plays: 1.
Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most).
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Competition for resources, some scarce and some unlimited. Some cooperation in Ragnarök. Some actions and tiles that target other players directly. Some trading.
Randomness: Low – tile drafting and some tile draw.

Replayability: Pretty high. This feels like it has depth. I’d want to play again now that I understand the interlocking mechanisms.
Fun: Good fun. Hidden simultaneous role selection at the start of each turn is fun.The decision making of board management is pretty fun. Ragnarök felt like a fun and epic conclusion to the game.
Memorability: Not so high, it’s a VP race that doesn’t create stories. This is better than most though. The theme works pretty well in this regard.

Thematic integration: Good. You remember that your action and tile drafting represents offerings to the gods. You call the gods by their names and not just “red resource god”. I probably enjoy the theme more because I’m Swedish. The Ragnarök conclusion feels very thematic.
Components: Mostly good. A well produced game. The cartoonish art is odd though. The art says “this is a game for kids”, but it’s much too complex for kids. Seems like a mismatch.

Who will like this: Gamers who enjoy dealing with uncertainty.

RATING: 7.6
This is a real gamer's game:  it's for people who play a lot of different games and want something new & unique. Asgard is a bit fiddly and the systems in the game are hard to figure out, but it is a fast and confrontational game which creates a sense of urgency and immediacy.  Despite this, it is hard to grasp the implications of your choices - so the game feels more complex than I think it is.   More plays needed.

Possibly my favorite worker placement game. The combination of extremely limited spaces, epic endgame battles, and streamlined gameplay result in a very enjoyable experience.

A game of redounding complexity, at least in the explanation, as some actions have four or more consequences; seeming sometimes to be willfully obtuse (e.g., rules around god vs population tiles that flip in regular vs final battle). What I'm so taken by is the constantly in-flux arc, the near-continuous recalculation and repositioning based upon every single move in each phase, although it takes one play through to see how it mostly fits together (and more than that to see how it all fits together)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game has a lot going for it:

- lots of interaction between players (for a Euro) which means you really have to watch what others are doing (this is not multi-player solitaire)
- plays very quickly (once you understand the rules)
- makes sense thematically (more than most Euros I would say)
- medium-ish brain power, but no brain-burner
- colourful, interesting art


Downsides:

- rules were a headache to figure out (took more effort to read than a lot of Euros I've played)
- rules take a long time to explain to new players
- set up is a little longer and more fiddly than I like, but that's a minor complaint

Rules were a bit of torture to get through but the game play was very quick.  The game felt a lot lighter than it looked on paper.  I've played five times, twice with two players and thrice with three.  We all agreed it was very good.  I can't understand why this one isn't ranked higher.

RATING: 7.5
Fantastic role-selection, worker placement game set using Norse mythology as a backdrop. The board is pretty and the complementing artwork is fun and colorful. It's a Euro but with war elements where players build up the forces for either good or bad for victory points. The game's six rounds are to set you up for the final round of Ragnorak where the Gods fight each other using armies and magic. The game play is not intuitive but players will understand the rounds after round two. There are lots of moving parts and mechanics with lots of cardboard chits and tiles and I'm not sure if they mesh well together. It's a very jarring, but ultimately satisfying experience. Fair warning; the game eats up a lot of table space and all the cardboard is really confusing at first. But I liked it.

Asgard is a somewhat convoluted game about investing in various Norse gods and benefiting when those gods win battles in Ragnarok.  The game provides a lot of avenues, such as building temples to the gods to give you points every turn, or getting special abilities that will help your favored gods in the final battle.  Eventually, players will be invested in the same or opposing gods, so there's a lot riding on who will emerge victorious.  It's an interesting concept, but as I said, a little rules-heavy for what it is.

It's a euro game with worker placement and such, but it has an incredible theme that makes sense with the whole purpose of the game: Defeat Ragnarok !!

One point that might scare some players: This game is complex !! It has a tons of components and some small details that you need to learn in order to succeed. But once everyone learned the rules, it is a blast to play !! 

Go grab a copy while you still can !!

This is my discovery of the year !!

(+) Nice artwork

(+) Some clever mechanics (the price of getting extra action disks depends on the amount of action disks of the oppenent who performs the least in this area, some engine building aspects with 'picking sides' during battles and building temples, 'sacrificing' action disks on actions like supporting gods or picking sides during battles, ...).

(+) In general the mechanic with battles at the end of every round is actually more enjoyable than I thought when I first read the rules. I'm not a big fan of chaotic randomness in games and while this sure is present in this mechanic, enough control is offered by sending extra soldiers when necessary and assessing de state of the board correctly. This aspect feels like the fun aspects of colorfully gambling 'Las Vegas' style with enough control to keep things interesting.

(-) The theme is largely disconnected from the gameplay, making certain game-elements and their explanation a bit dry.

(-) The game induces too much chaos: I *hate* the mechanic in which players can steal away resources from others. It is nearly impossible to read others when deciding which god cards to pick at the start of each round - but this can have a huge impact, especially when you are late in turn order. A small detail you can not foresee can catastrophically ruin your greater plan and lose you some precious actions. This is not my definition of fun.

(-) This game with a ton of similarly looking tiles is a pain to set up.

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) Action disks are hard to come by: use them wisely. Sacrificing one to support a god early in game might not be the best course of action. However, building a big temple (5 or 7 points) in the first/second round can get you 25 - 28 points + potentially extra points when the god you support performs well in the final battle. The price of this strategy is losing one of your 3 precious action disks early on.
(*) At first we thought 'betting' on the end of round battles was a waste of action disks. However, if few players use this mechanic, this can be an important en reliable point generator: with 5 disks there by round 4, you will have scored way over 30 points and will posess 'final battle tiles' which you can use during the final battle (given you have managed to support at least one god).
(*) Turn order is important to reduce the effect of 'random chaos' in your game
(*) When collecting special stones, be mindful that when having more than one of each type makes you a good victim for stealing opponents.

Seems like a good heavy euro but there are just so many fidgety little rules and things going on that make this game not so great.  Also in a 3 player game, it could easily end up being 2 players vs. 1 player which is not very balanced. Not much the 3rd player can do.

This is the type of board game I enjoy the most. It has several interlocking mechanisms that allow players and turns to interact and cascade in interesting ways. It all adds up to a final climactic end-game battle between the different gods and populations of Norse mythology. 

The game has great components and looks good on the table. The theme is interesting and well-implemented. 

As noted by others, the game thrives on player interaction and unfortunately does not scale well. It is by far best played with the maximum number of 4 players (if not for this my rating would be at least one higher).

Asgard is good. Not excitingly or surprisingly good. Kind of methodically good. The kind of good where you are done and you're, like, "Yeah, that was good."

Asgard is also really complicated and heavy. If you like reading rules, as I do, then it's almost a game itself to figure out how to play. And when you get it right, it is satisfying. I feel like it took us a game and a half to get it to click together and start fitting in my head. Some summary sheets or turn order cards for everyone would have been nice in the box, particularly if there was a good Ragnarok summary for the end. There might be some good files here on BGG, but I didn't look yet.

Because you have to do a lot of planning about which gods to support and which to use when requesting help, there's some excellent long-term strategies to consider. The action selection/worker placement is great. And the resources are scarce in a unique way; if you need X resources, and not enough is available, you take from whoever has the most.

I'm not especially keen on the mythological theme of the game, but it works fine; I feel like if this were a mob boss game or science fiction I might have enjoyed it even more.

I'm glad I have it, especially since it seems to be cheap everywhere. And I'm even more satisfied that I took the time to learn it and will play it more in the future.

Played once with 3P. The gist of Asgard's convoluted gameplay is as follows: Collect stones and seals. Then build temples from stones, and incite gods to meddle in worldly affairs. Then use seals to unlock discs, and use [i]those[/i] discs to wager on the outcome of worldly battles. Trigger special effects and pick up power tiles along the way. After repeating this process for five rounds, go out in the blaze of glory that is Ragnarök. Capisce?

There are other aspects which do the game no favours – the rulebook doesn't provide a satisfactory overview, tiles have similar appearances and terminology, and there is the usual surfeit of icons. If you're willing to iron the wrinkles out after a learning game, you will be rewarded with glimpses of modestly interesting design underneath. The secret pre-selection of action spaces is rather clever, as is the appropriately thematic buildup towards the Ragnarök.

In the end though, it doesn't pay to slog through the more banal elements just to experience a sprinkling of semi-interesting mechanisms and thematic interludes.

RATING: 5
The idea of this game really intrigued me.  Norse mythology, special god powers, worker placement.  It sounded like a winner.  It doesn't exactly play out like it sounds though.

In this game each player is "backing" certain gods.  Using their powers to collect resources and using those resources to build temples to that god and gain his favor for points in the final battle, Ragnarok.  You also have the option to place your workers in a common area to get more workers and fight little skirmish battles for early points before the final battle.  This game does have a decent amount of strategy to it and is all about right decisions and timing.  The reason is each round consists of 4 phases.  First you choose which gods you want to influence simultaneously, then you reveal those gods one at a time in turn order placing your worker on one of his available spaces, then when that is done you actually remove those disks one at a time in turn order to take action.  This offers a lot of opportunity for timing to really mess up a strategy so careful planning is key.

That's the one part I actually like, it is very engaging and challenging and rewards careful play and forward thinking.  Saying "that's the one part I actually like" though gives  away that I didn't care for the rest of the game.  This actually reminded me a lot of Yggdrasil, a game I did not care for.  Not just because of the theme of Norse mythology but both games just boil down to very abstract experiences of collecting numbers and adding them together hoping your numbers are the highest.

On top of that the game is incredibly fiddly and unnecessarily convoluted.  For it to be worth dealing with that a game needs to really impress and make it worth your while.  This one certainly didn't.

A tree of Nordic Gods. Players fight in several worlds, supporting dark or light sides waiting for the final (finalissima) grand battle of the Gods, with all and each of the worlds inploding in great wars.

The mechanic is simple: Worker placement with cards. Funky but it works. Players have 10 cards, each one representing one God. Players also have discs with each representing one action. Starting each round, players choose one card to each disc. This means that with 4 discs I can activate 4 Gods, with 5 discs, 5 Gods. Simple. The more actions you have, the more you play on the board.

And then you have some 'carrots' to run for on the board and these carrots mean VP. But if you get them, then you have to leave your disc on the board for the rest of the game. What does this mean?! It means that you now have one disc on the board (which is GREAT because you get VP) but it also means that you don't have that disc with you to activate a God in the next round. Decisions, decisions. Get more actions OR get those VP's. Interesting mechanic concerning number of actions that increase and decrease with the game flow.

The artwork is amazing. One of the most beautiful boards out there. Time of play gets over 2 hours and easilly, with the first play, being over 3!!! 
A solid game, very well structured, with lots of difficult decisions. A brain burner for sure, especially for first plays. Several paths for victory. Very recomendable if one likes heavy, meaty games. For non-fans of this kind of heavy game, please keep away from it. Too much going on for a player who wishes an easy plan.

Essen 12 is rolling well, again!

Reasons I like this game:
-Beautiful board and art; high quality production.
-Managing your # of actions and the timing of those actions is very strategic.
-The end game scoring (Ragnarok) is highly competitive and thematic.
-The game flow is varied and interesting; it rewards strategic and tactical thinking.

Reasons I hate this game:
-The rules are rather long and it can be challenging to teach to new players.
-The downtime between moves can be a little long; players that have AP can really make the game drag.

TL;DR: Excellent production, deep strategy and fun endgame scoring.

RATING: 5
Oddly chaotic euro themed after Ragnarok. Players A) simultaneously reveal which gods they will worship, B) take turns placing workers on thos gods, then C) take turns activate them. This structure is important because turn order can change any time in B) or C). There's an advantage to early placement, but also one to activate.

Further frustrating matters is that dedicating workers to any of the persistent scoring opportunities (temples/battles) requires a permanent sacrifice of a worker, so constant recruitment is necessary -- but ability to recruit depends on timing.

In case it weren't already hard enough to plan, most components are limited and, if required to be taken, are stolen from the player(s) with the most.

Battle resolution involves significant hidden information, so there's also a degree of bluffing.

I have softened a little on this one in hindsight, now that I know what it is and what it is trying to be, but I'm not particularly fond of this level of complexity mixed with this degree of chaos. If the focus is the bluffing of the final battles for the realms then it would be better to dispense with all of the tile-collection frou-frou. Like most WYG? titles it's packed with extraneous mechanisms adding complexity for its own sake.

Specific annoyances are the hidden information in the temple draw and the battle scoring that only seems worth the effort if uncontested. The weird turn-order mechanism is complex and it contributes very little other than to drastically decrease control.

The good: Fun theme, nice art, interesting choices.  It's basically a worker placement game where you narrow down where your workers might go, then you place them in order, and then you take them off in order.  I'm not sure any game has done it in this way, and it creates some compelling problems to solve.

The bad: that much complication in order to simply grab the items from a worker placement spot makes for a lot of AP and a much longer playing time than is justified.  The end of the game is extremely swingy, and will often determine the game, but I think the average first time group will take three hours to get there (counting setup and rules explanation), and a normal game will take at least two.  If I'm going to spend that much time, I'd rather play a less swingy game with more depth.

One half-played game at Essen after a weak rules explanation (if you have tried to play games in the Essen halls after verbal rules explanations, you know what I mean).
Naturally, this can only be a first impression, but to me the game feels a lot like Vinhos - lots of small tactical decision points while at the same time losing the "big picture" of what to aim for strategically.
Another case of "too much".

RATING: 5
Kind of strange. Worker placement, with a lot of indirect interactions. Much of the game is spent preparing for the final battle. This isn't a bad game, but it doesn't really seem worth the overal "messiness" of the game when there are a lot of other fantastic worker placement games coming out.
Side note: The artwork is just downright odd. Freya wearing a bikini riding a giant cat? Huh?

RATING: 3.5
Game looks gorgeous! Sadly, that is the only redeeming quality it has. Rulebook is terrible, gameplay is boring, and all in all the best thing about the 1.5 hour game we played is that we all agreed to walk away from it before we got to the end. And that it was a demo so no money was burnt on it.

Truly disappointing game.

Lots going on and all building towards Ragnarok at the end of 5 rounds of play.  Unfortunately, it isn't intuitively clear how the actions in the first part of game lead up to Ragnarok, until you see it in action for the first time. By that time you have already played at least 90 minutes.  I'm sure it greatly improves with repeated plays, but I'm not I have the energy to try it again with another new group.

Asgard is a game I picked up because it was supercheap, got me free shipping, and looked somewhat interesting. After I read the rules I was really intrigued to play the game.

In the game, you're supporting various Norse Gods by building temples to them, calling on them for favors (building materials and special abilities), and fighting in battles. The game revolves around playing cards matching the various gods. Playing a god's card lets you visit that god, to beg favors or build a temple to them, or to visit Asgard (where you can participate in battles). Having built temples or having warriors won battles will score you points every round (the game is only 5 rounds) and at the end of the game Ragnarok happens. All the players who have built temples will have chosen which battle their god will fight in at Ragnarok. If the god you support wins a battle you get points depending on where they fought.

There's a good bit going on in this game. And it's a little overwhelming at first, but its one of those games where the rules seem confusing when you're learning them the first time, but once you figure them out they're not nearly as complicated as they seemed.

Asgard has confrontation. If any supplies ever run short, you steal them from whoever has the most. Also, you secretly choose cards at the beginning of the round and then play them one at a time... so you can be blocked out of an action you had chosen to do that turn. There's usually a consolation action that you can do, but still. Someone else can steal turn order or build the only thing you're able to build before you get a chance. And at Ragnarok, when your god goes up against someone else's, only one side can win and get points. Direct player confrontation isn't something I always care for, but it wasn't an issue for me in this game. There are usually ways to compensate or ameliorate what happens.

I liked the game a good bit. I spent some of the first play double checking rules, as there are a lot of them to keep track of, and I didn't really grok some of the situations mentioned by the rules until we played the game. So I want to go back and play again now that I think I have the rules pretty much down.

Why is this game so under-rated here on the geek?  Compared to other WYG titles, like Nippon, Zhanguo, Signorie and Railroad Revolution (all of which I also own and love) this is rated so low.  Asgard has all the WYG hallmarks - clever, interwined mechanisms, tension, tough decisions, etc.  In addition, there's a side-offering of trying to guess-timate what other players will be up: will they choose that God you want to select, or take those tiles or that action you need?  

There's a nice tension not just in the action selection phase, but also in the action execution phase, where player order can change dynamically if a player has chosen Odin to visit. I also like the way that players have to be careful not to hoard 'resources', since unlike most other games, if a plkayer needs something from the supply and it isn't there, they get to take them from the player who currently has most!  So many other good things to say, but this remark would be too long!

So glad I took a chance and bought this.

Excellent euro with emergent alliances and euro-style combat. Tension builds toward the final battle of Ragnarok which I find quite fulfilling. This game has a bit of a meta-problem in that if a euro that needed exactly 4 players to be good were on the cards I'd likely lobby for Tigris & Euphrates instead.

Wow.  What a unique game.  More than any other I've recently played, however, you have to see how the end game is scored before you can develop a good strategy to play.  I'd suggest the teacher set up a sample Ragnarok and play through it so players can see the relative values of things.

We are mortals able to somehow wield tremendous influence to effect the ultimate destruction of the Norse Gods come Ragnarok. This influence is accomplished by building temples, influencing the battles of good and evil upon the yggdrasil tree of the nine realms, giving glory to select Gods for the favor of a seal and special powers. When our influence wanes it can be replenished in Asgard. In the comiing of Ragnarok we can only hope that we have placed our loyalty on the winning God. It took me four times to figure out this game and I'm still not sure I'm ready to teach it to the game group. I love the limiting mechanic that prevents players from loading up on extra workers. This game also has a terrific mechanic to prevent stock piling of very limited resources...if supply runs out, take from a player that has it--awesome. The variable phase aspect makes each turn very different and a major part of the game is bluffing and anticipating which Gods will be visited by the other players in which order. This hugely changes best laid plans into a series of consolation tactics. First player is huge in this game.

My strong suggestion is to watch the gameplay video because the basic mechanics are not that difficult and the video makes it much easier to understand what is going on.  All of these options allow many different strategies and options which make this a very deep game.  Has a lot more theme than most Euros.

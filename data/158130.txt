Instructions unclear on the addition of the beer cards and how they function. As with most games another play and some player aids will be a huge help in teaching in the future.

Oddly fun deckbuilding game that has similar mechanics to Dominion but uses them in a more agreeable way. Maids with victory points still take up space in your deck, but there are universal ways to cull them and keep deck composition in check; there are other noncompeting methods to gain victory points that do not mess with deck composition as well. The theme is absolutely ridiculous and I love it.

Got this mainly because i'm German and from Munich and wanted to see a japanese take on the Oktoberfest.

Pretty much Dominion with more coherent theme and artwork. Some light PvP options sprinkled in but overall it's your baseline Deckbuilder without bells and whistles.

Set up can be a bit annoying but other than that a great game! Deck building at its purest.  The art is not to be overlooked as well.

What I liked:
* Scoring was easier than I thought it would be
* lots of options to experiment with playstyle
* Fairly meldable with the other sets

What I didn't like:
* While there is lots of scoring options, I'm adamant some pathways are better than others
* Text on cards is very inconsistent

While I like the cards in the base game, the interactions of the cards in Oktoberfest are much more interesting.  Hence the higher score.

This is pretty much Dominion rip-off with different theme and art. I can imagine much better card design (larger letters etc.), but as a such, I can enjoy the game. Beer concept cards in this expansion are quite interesting, but I cannot compare with other expansions at this moment.

I'm not sure who this game is for. If you like Dominion, just play Dominion. If you like looking at provocative anime girls, there are plenty of places online to do that. This game brings absolutely nothing to the table, and the fact that it relies so heavily on using cards you can normally only use one of each turn is a really bad choice.

(Review based on first play with suggested card set)

Surprisingly, we did not enjoy this set as much as the base set or 'Expanding the House'.  It felt really unbalanced and unpleasantly annoying and confusing. We'll need to play a few more times before I am convinced this is better than a 6. :( 

[b]Issues we experienced:[/b]
1) Inconsistent language on the cards caused some confusion.  Several of the maids have abilities that activate when they are employed.  Some of the cards clearly say that in the text whereas others only use a symbol.

2) Many of the cards required a lot of seemingly unnecessary extra steps to use their abilities to the extent that we could rarely use them even when they were in our hands.

3) Chaining cards was WAY more difficult than in other sets.  Most of the time, I could only play one card out of my hand each turn.  Entire turns were often wasted on a single action.

4) Most of the purchasable maids were worth no points, could not be chambered, and were worth no love to the point where deck balancing was very hard.  The winner won the game by spending most of their time buying love cards and the one maid that actually gave points when chambered.

5) Most of the maids no one wanted to buy because they would just fill our decks full of clutter and limit what we could do.  We of course realized this a bit too late and were hampered by the cards we should not have bought.  And, each time I wanted to get rid of a bad card, I had to wait until I had 2 servings to spend at the same time as I had a Chief Maid so that I could chamber her.  Then wait until the undesired cards came up again to remove one.  It was WAY more bothersome that I thought it should be. 

6) Getting victory points at all was super difficult.  I'm pretty sure we had the lowest scores we've ever seen in this series.

7) The second Chief Maid relied on another specific maid which the starting setup did not say to use ... since the Chief Maids need to be in every setup, it seems odd to me to have one rely on a non-Chief Maid that may not be in the setup.

RATING: 8
Jak na razie chyba najsłabsza część. Głównie ze względu na trochę przekombinowane pokojówki. Mechanika z piwem jest całkiem fajna, aleee... Wymaga obecności na stole jednej z dwóch specjalnych pokojówek - a to nie pozwala np. na całkowcie losowy wybór kart do rozgrywki.

A decent re-entry to a rather indecently-themed deckbuilding series. Beer is the obvious centrepiece of Oktoberfest, and can provide a lot of VP if you're willing to take a gamble. If you choose not to play with Events (as my group does), then getting Beer is a strong strategy which can't be ignored. Unlike the other signature mechanisms of previous sets though, Beer doesn't quite seamlessly integrate into the overall game because there are only two maids who can actually [i]get[/i] Beer into play.

The set also includes some fresh support for older mechanisms. There is a new Building (yay!) and 3 new Events (ugh!), although Private Maids are conspicuously absent.

The biggest drawback of Oktoberfest is that it tends to drag due to the inclusion of the costliest Maid Chief yet and a maid who serves to clutter opponents' decks. For this reason, it makes for a weak standalone game. It does work wonderfully when paired with another set though, because beer makes everything better (gameplay-wise, that is).

I don't think much of Tanto Cuore, but I play it on iOS every so often. One of my ho-hums about the game, though, is its French maid theme. German beermaids are way hotter! And since my wife and I enjoy celebrating Oktoberfest yearly, this would see regular (if infrequent) gameplay.

I'm not a huge anime fan, the art style can be off-putting to me, so I was skeptical to play this at first. After I learned the game play, I was addicted and now I don't want to stop playing. I love that the maid options available can change up each game. This being an expansion, the Oktoberfest event cards are fun (set collecting bonuses). I want more Tanto Cuore!

The least successful of the Tanto mechanics:  
Beer cards seem like a great idea, but w/ only 2 Bar Maids (expensive ones at that!),
and a relatively cheap Event card to mess w/ those,
it simply doesn't stack up against, say: the Reminisce cards from Vacation.
~~Seriously: when an expensive yet successful  'Beer' strategy only nets 1/2 the points of chambering the cheapest maid, what can you say?

adding the beer cards to the game and the events really made the game feel different from the Doki Doki Vacation version.

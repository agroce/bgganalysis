Just not as good at Titan and no where near as good as Colossal Arena. The attacking aspect was good in theory but just made the game too much for what it is. It should be more of a bluffing game than a strategy game. 1 "Dragon/Wyrm" is good but not 8 of them.

This game is fun.  Good balance, short length, backstabbing, and alliances.  My gamer and nongamer friends all like this one.  Rules are a bit of a pain to read, but worth the effort.

RATING: 9
An excellent game, with plenty of good strategy and a theme I love.  The main reason this game loses a point, though, is the difficult to understand rulebook - seems to explain the rules backwards and doesn't flow well.  Apart from that, one of my faves!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
R Knizia, Space theme, cool cards with spaceships on them. This seems like a good game, although the plastic markers gives it a cheap feeling. This game needs a new rule book, with a good getting started guide. I've read the rules several times but never managed to understand the gameplay. After Race for the Galaxy came out, I put this in a drawer, and I'm probably not going to take it out again.

Titan the Arena on steroids.

If you liked Titan the Arena (or Colossal Arena) you'll probably like this too. Underlying game is the same (bid on 8 different races, 3 survive at the end to pay out), but lots of extra stuff added, which increases interaction at the cost of adding more randomness and complexity.

Rethemed to space - which I quite like, and you can attack other cards (ships) and bids (called bases), and cards all have special powers 

Overall, like it - but for newbies I'd play Colossal Arena first ...

GMT took a relatively simple game, Titan: The Arena, and turned it into a more complex and random affair.  The theme gets in the way of learning the game.  Avoid.  Play T:tA instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not a great game - less control than Titan: the Arena, I think - but a lot of fun to play and always something to do. Complex, sometimes gratuitously so (it's from GMT, after all), and definitely nothing on the cleaner-playing and superior Titan: The Arean. If you have a gut-level aversion to fiddlyness, avoid like the plague; but the underlying game is still Knizia (even if barely recognizable), and all the chaos does add a fun factor, so the game is still recommended to folks who are fans of both euros and GMT's stuff.

RATING: 4
A lot of added details from the Titan base, and I don't care for the overall effect. The combat seems like a neat idea, but it ends up being a serious wildcard based on how good you can roll where the traditional Titan framework makes luck as such a much smaller part of the game because every card (low, middle, high value) has a use. I also vehemently dislike the way hands can be extremely variable in size and how hard it is to get rid of the drek that is clogging up your hand. All of the new chrome seems like a good idea in concept, but it makes the game much harder to teach and also makes the length of the game drag out much longer than it should. I already thought that Titan was on the edge of being too long, and this absolutely decimates that game in length due to the combat and other factors. This is an interesting variant on the Titan engine, but I still prefer the original and would generally only be willing to play Galaxy with people who are already at least familiar with Titan because otherwise there is just way too much to take in for first-timers.

I see no reason to play this now that Colossal Arena is available, and the gameplay in that is cleaner. Some government powers can be used in non-predictable ways, which can be surprising, or imbalancing, depending on your perspective.

GMT Games.  Neat game in which players place bets on alien races and do "their best" to eliminate the races they are not betting on and keep the races alive that they are betting on.  This multi-player game is a thinker's game and can almost be classified as a heavy euro style game.  Galaxy The Dark Ages is a solid game and the game mechanic system is based on the Avalon Hill title Titan The Arena.

More chaotic than Titan the Arena, but I like the choices you have here that you don't have in TtA.  Attacking to remove ships or move bases actually seemed like it gave me more control, despite the added layer of chrome (or chaos, whatever you want to call it).  After playing both TtA and Galexy in the past week, I'm glad I've got Galaxy and will gladly play it, all chrome included.  (For reference purposes, I rated TtA an 8 on the Geek, simply because this is harder to figure out than TtA was).

Ok game, but I still think Titan is way better. All the abilities on the cards combined with all shooting makes the first hidden bid VERY important to the point where people without it surviving the game can't really win.

RATING: 6
A ramped up version of Titan: The Arena, set in space.  Originally slated for Avalon Hill, it ended up at GMT.  More options lessens the luck factor, but not sure if the game needs it.  Hardly recognise a Knizia design in there now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm not sure who would ever have thought Titan: the Arena needed dice, but this is actually a pretty decent reworking.  I like that bets-- er, bases-- can be moved up and down; this definitely adds something to the strategy, and it means it's harder to be mathematically eliminated.  The "spoils of victory" rule also adds some twists to the decision about when to end a round.

RATING: 6
Good game with nice interaction.  Can be quite random, and often has an endgame problem (some players know they cannot win, or run out of cards and just watch).  Galaxy is more random than Titan:the Arena, since it allows less card discards and draws, and can reduce playersâ€™ hand sizes via special cards.  Galaxy allows attacks on cards and bases (bets), and moving bases, which is fun and adds variety, but is also randomly based.  It also has more destruction of played cards via ship attacks and provides more options for players each turn, increasing game time, which is not compatible with its increased level of randomness over Titan the Arena, and thus is inferior to the earlier game.

The extra layer of complexity compared with Titan:The Arena doesn't improve the game significantly, so in a way the latter is a better, cleaner design. However, this does make a nice change occasionally. Now given away as we would never play this in preference to Titan: The Arena

RATING: 1
Now, is this a really terrible game? No. It is, however far far worse than Titan: The Arena. The rules additions in Galaxy takes the game from a fast moving betting game to a plodding pseudo combat game. The art is fairly poor too. 

With these factors considered, and taking into account how much better Titan: The Arena is I'd be really hard pressed to play this game ever again.

It says it all on the box: Designed by Reiner Knizia and Don Greenwood.  My two favorite designers under one lid, and from different poles of game design as well.  Deeper and more tense than colossal arena with great artwork, solid theme and great quality cards.  Yes there are more rules but there are also more options as you play.  One time through and you'll have it down.  The rule book is excellent with a good play example to help.  I like the bluff, hidden information and all around sneakiness of this game.  One of the few space themed games I love (along with Race for the Galaxy).  I'd always be up for a game!

Worse in every possible way than it's "father", the much better Titan: The Arena/Colossal Arena. Longer, more random, more rules, more chrome that is difficult to remember... yuch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
After many plays, I'm still hooked. Like any card game, luck of the draw figures significantly, but the game is all about hedging your bets and making good tactical decisions.  Don't be too serious and you'll enjoy it.  

The greater simplicity of [b]Colossal Arena[/b] makes it a better choice for new gamers. However, the ability to raise and lower bases (bets) and the overall feeling of conflict in [b]Galaxy[/b] make for a stronger, tenser game.  I am tempted to tinker with the combat rules, but they work reasonably well as is.

RATING: N/A
Having only played Titan: The Arena, I am very curious to play this.  People complain about the chrome and complexity of the rules, but it doesn't seem all that bad.  You can attack other ships and promote/demote people's bets, and low playing cards grant you a power for that turn, but that seems to be it.

Galaxy: the Dark Ages has been widely panned as an inferior chrome-laden version of Titan: the Arena.  I like both.  I would rate TtA ahead of GtDA because it's cleaner, easier to teach and remember the rules, and for that reason more likely to come off the shelf.  But the extra elements added in Galaxy give the game some interesting variety and create a more complex decision space.  Although Galaxy is more interesting tactically, it lacks strategic clarity because of the chaos and unpredictability that the changes introduce.  There's so much happening that the game state is very wild and dynamic compared to TtA.

A reworking of Colossal Arena with yet more chaos added in the form of special abilities on the cards to compensate for lower values. Two things kill it for me: die rolling for combat (you can bet that was GMT's idea) and the fact that you can't discard cards for abandoned worlds as well as play a ship card. Luck and chaos together do not make for a thought-provoking experience.

RATING: 8
Obviously similar to Colossal Arena - they're in the same game "family tree".  The movement of bases up and down adds some complexity, as does the hand management rules (i.e., take an action to discard a "dead" card); however, these features actually make this game a bit deeper than the others in this genre.  [I consider this a "gamer's" version of Colossal Arena.]

Whether one prefers the additional complexities here or the more smooth Colossal Arena would seem to be personal preference.  I like both.

I like this game but its complexity and length make it difficult to introduce to casual players. Making it more like [I]Titan: the Arena[/I] by stripping away a lot of the chrome (especially combat) might be an introductory way in. [8 plays]

Long awaited sequel to Titan the Arena that disappoints. Theme is races in space forming bases. The dice off of powers, getting exposed bases knocked down added extra elements of luck to the original game of Titan.

This isn&#039;t a bad game, but it loses in comparison to its predecessor -- Titan: the Arena.  That game had everything that&#039;s good about Galaxy, without the useless chrome that did nothing but complicate the rules, add chaos, and lengthen the playing time.  Unfortunately, T:tA is a collectible now, so Galaxy is a reasonable substitute if you can&#039;t find a copy of that better game.

A great game where you need to be very focused on your goals and make wise bets. A more advanced version of Titan: The arena and Collosal Arena, but unfortunately only has 8 races, where the others had twelve and 8 were chosen for each game. 4 more races would add more variety to the game.

Simile a Colossal Arena ma con alcune carte speciali in piÃ¹ che lo rendono piÃ¹ complesso. L'ambientazione nello spazio Ã¨ un po' meno bella e il fatto che non esista una versione italiana lo rendono complesso specie nelle prime partite. 
Le carte di valore piÃ¹ basso hanno dei poteri speciali e quindi risulta spesso utile poterle giocare, nell'insieme piÃ¹ curato e complesso di Colossal Arena, ma se vi Ã¨ piaciuto non potete perdervelo.

This game is a Titan the arena knockoff with enough rules and exceptions to make player aid cards a necessity (which, btw aren't included). I much prefer Titan the Arena which is a much cleaner version without all the twitchy rules.

RATING: 6
Your VPs come from bets on which colours / races are going to survive, the earlier the bet the more VPs you make but the bigger target it is for players to kill it. Having a race survive is a matter of making sure that when every colour has a card (valued 1-10) below it, your colour isn't lowest. Playing cards in your colour give you a power ability to mix things up, which means some colours are more targeted than others. It eventually comes down to a meta-game of semi-alliances in an attempt to keep your strongest cards until later when alliances crumble. And that's the game - bet in colours others want to keep, play as low as possible as long as you can and table-talk it like crazy, hope that others get ganged up on rather than you. Although the tech tree abilities provide some chrome that makes it more interesting than its ancestors, playing the player isn't a favourite genre of mine, and there's not much else to offer here, so it's a game I now pass on.

RATING: 5
This is an expanded version of Colossal Arena that has more card texts and special abilities.  In that way, it's a better game, but it is still a betting game where you have a minimal amount of control over what happens.  It's still pretty dull, and you still have a good chance of being out of the running early on.

Okay game, but a little too much chrome.  A little too "American-ish" for me these days.. but it is playable once you get over the illusionary learning curve.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Actually I think this theme works better. Two complaints: The "Troll" has become even more powerful now with upgradeable bases. It is a very slow process getting rid of unplayable cards, something that lessens the control over the endgame.

A bit too complex for the play value. 
With all the special powers, and the card deals it seems to be quite random. 
The strategy seems to be related to the placement of bases. 
Don't see it getting to the table much.

A good game.  I prefer it to Titan: the Arena as it allows more opportunity for clever play and provides a chance to get back into the game in the late stages by attacking an opponent&#039;s bases (bets).  I am not keen on the wacky power cards (equipment?) so we leave them out.  Very good with three players.

RATING: 5
Why is Colossal Arena rated higher than this game even though they are essentially the same? This game adds an utterly ridiculous combat mechanism and has individual special powers for cards which adds too much complexity and length to an otherwise elegant game. I bet someone was playing Titan: The Arena and said, "You know what would be cool? If the people could attack each other!" Other guy: "ZOMG! That would be the bomb diggity!" Thus, this game was born. Now, let it die.

This game is basically Colossal Arena with a bunch of needless mechanics. I suppose it might be alright for introducing Risk/Axis&Allies gamers to boardgames, since the extra mechanics are usually combat oriented, but really its just an inferior game next to Colossal Arena.

Galaxy is a good and challenging game, though much more fiddly and cutthroat than its predecessor. Competition can be fierce and you can get practically eliminated from the game fairly easily, sometimes through no fault of your own. A slightly heavier game than your typical euro.

This sequel to Titan: The Arena isn't an improvement. The new rules don't add enough to the game to justify losing the simplicity that makes Titan an outstanding game. Plus, while I'm an unabashed fan of sci-fi, the theme in Titan: The Arena works better. The one thing this has going for it over the original incarnation of the game is that it's in print and available. The added chrome isn't an improvement, but this is still a solid game and well worth picking up for those for whom Titan is no longer an option.

Galaxy is a more advanced version of Colossal Arena / Titan: The Arena, with sci-fi trappings. It's a bit awkward, as it's too complicated for a card game, but too simple for a full-on boardgame.

Good game, but there's so much going on I fear it will never come out with my casual gaming friends. Not so tough to play really, but it does take some time to explain.

The game design is fantastic, though the rulebook comes as close to hiding the genius of it as possible ;) Seriously, the rules appear ponderous and overwritten, but they quickly melt into comprehension.

Essentially, this game is a spreadsheet - it could have had a stock-trading theme. Yet, the graphics and SF theme work nicely. 

Definitely one of the most intriguing mechanics I've experienced in a long time. I teach it to people just to show them the mechanic.

it is really not 90 minutes, at least first time you play it, even after playing TitanArena. BUT:
This game is really EPIC !! it is an overwhelming experience, even played in two. I liked it sooo much ! you have a lot of possible things to do (and unfortunately a lot of things to learn before starting to play) but the experience is totally rewarding. loads of ships with different powers, loads of different and PERFECTLY balanced special powers. I am sure tests where amazingly thorough to reach such a result.  a great game !

Update: much time later my second game was pretty disappointing: probably the first time we got a rule wrong but this time it seems so strange to have to draw only one card per turn. 2 out of 4 players ended with 3/4 cards among which to choose one and it was terribly frustrating. I am perplexed

A good example of having more doesn't necessarily mean it is for the better.  Galaxy the Dark Ages took the easily understood rules of Colossal Arena and went several steps further by adding a handful of new gameplays such as giving individual cards their own ability, special technologies, combat and dice rolling.  The end result was a clunkier game that increased the duration of each turn and its resolution.  Not to mention allowing it to be more susceptible to AP.  An unwelcomed and undesirable update to the original.

RATING: 6
An interesting evolution of the Titan/Colossal Arena card game. Unfortunately, it can become a little too fiddly for its own good, which drags out the game since the outcome can come down to the fiddling. Colossal Arena is a breezier, more fun game.

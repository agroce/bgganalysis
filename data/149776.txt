Ainda não jogado. A versão PTBR veio com alguns problemas no manual (mas contornáveis e a empresa já se manifestou na solução do caso), mas o jogo é TÃO bonito que chega a impressionar...

Update: o jogo tem mecânicas legais e interessantes, mas tem muitos erros na produção, o que desabona o lançamento. Jogo interessante, mas nada além disso: interessante. Já foi embora da coleção...

This game has some great interactions in a co-op. My only concern is the replayability. After playing a mission it might not be as fun to play the same mission over and over. I do feel like something is missing. Like you want your character to get better over a mission.

Only played one scenario while at a con:
The sum was greater than all the parts. The hand management system was pretty good, but the bad guys seemed basic and repetitive, the story was meh, and the map movement was okay. But my overall impression was very good! All the heroes felt powerful in their own right and really contributed to the team. Had a lot of fun and would play again if I had the chance.

Kickstarted.
Really nice components, the tiles are really well done and the miniatures are amazing.
Simple rule set.
Each character plays slightly differently because of how each deck is constructed. 
Each mission has a different feel to it even though you are doing the same actions.
Very much a co-op, if you fail to work together and help each other out you won't survive.

RATING: 8
This game, in my opinion, makes the best use of the "hand-management" card-driven combat mechanic to date.  (Actually it is a blend of this and die-rolling, because the cards tell you how many dice to roll in an attack -brilliant!). Alternately, cards can be used for a secondary ability which usually supports other players.  The game is very well-developed,  both mechanically and thematically.  

I like it far better than Mistfall and Myth, and find it at least equal to the Warhammer Quest Adventure Card Game.  Without the upcoming expansions, it does not have items or leveling mechanics, but it makes up for this in providing a board for full 3-dimensional combat.  

The AI is smart enough and the rules are clean and simple. There are several mechanics that ensure that each game will be significantly different, even when playing the same scenario.   The game is manageable solo as well as co-op.  The components are of very high quality.

Perfectly streamlined miniatures story driven skirmish game. Very cooperative, love the "Gears of war" hand-management system. Lots of choices to make. Great production value. I like the improvement that every player has its own action cards deck and can chose from individual class based focus cards. You can play your own role-style that way. The twist cards are great and give the monster different boosts and the shuffled recon deck with objective based encounters gives the game a nice narrative touch. 

It is a bit light for my own personal taste (in comparison to GD f.e.) but all in all an excellent game with tough choices to make.

We only played the first operation (3 missions), but so far I´m very excited about this game. So simple, yet the decisions you take matter a lot. It is very easy to get started and it works really well.
The flavor text on most items in the game is brief but very fitting and the introductions and after mission texts adds a nice atmosphere to the game.

WWII and supernatural things are both themes that interest me so those combined sounds to me like a nice thing. Co-op helps for solo-gaming and campaign-based for long time play also sounds like a plus. 
Art and miniatures looks good.
Rules seems to be easy and the game run smoothly. Not to deep with story but tough choices and hard to beat.

RATING: 10
Simple, fast and brutal with a ton of tactical decisions. Teamplay is absolutely vital if you wanna survive a few turns. The mixture of World War II and Horror is really cool. The excellent dark artwork captures the atmosphere perfectly. Components are excellent. People may complain about the extreme high luck factor, but the game is short, so if you´re unlucky, simply start again.
With the expansions, replay value is massive and it´s easy to create random missions. They´ve actually announced a card based random mission generator.

Rating adjusted a bit. I really like the combat and the tactical nature. I don't mind that the game can feel a bit "on rails", like an old arcade game, but movement is a little bland. Still waiting for expansions, but more importantly I'm excited about them.

RATING: 6.75
Fun, light miniature skirmish/dungeon crawlish game.  It's a blend of Gears of War and Zombicide.  Think the Gears of War hand management with reactions/cards as health but only basic actions against waves of respawning enemies.

The map is very open too, much more like a miniature skirmish game and not at all claustrophobic.

I think it's a solid game but it won't unseat Gears of War for sure.  It's much lighter and more repetitive as you push forward through waves of respawning enemies that function under very simple AI of repeatedly attack.  The action cards aren't quite as nuanced as Gears either.

What you have here is something that's easier to get into and carries a bit more narrative, but becomes more repetitive due to lack of variety in actions.

Simple rules don't get in the war of playing the game. Reminiscent of Gears of War but different. Basic AI with just the right touch of unpredictability. You know more or less what they are going to do... but it's not 100% mechanistic or predictable. The AI can still throw you a curve ball and you better be prepared.

It works fine - but there isn't much excitement in killing monsters when they just respawn all the time.  You can plan out a decent strategy, but random elements can throw that all haywire easily enough that you really just need to rely on tactics and let the game play you sometimes.

[u]Thoughts[/u]: A tough, tactical skirmish game very reminiscent of Gears of War. Forgoes an AI deck which presents the player with a solvable puzzle and allows her to plan turns ahead, akin to Mage Knight.

Doesn't have that kind of depth of cards, though. Each class has a set of 5 or so unique upgrade cards that they can add to their deck, specified by mission setup -- and sadly, that's it.

Hopefully the two upcoming expansions not only add more cards, but also I would love to see cards that the players can acquire [I]during the game[/I] through some sort of loot or xp system.

Predictable AI and limited card depth might make for eventual familiarity with the game, but it's quite fun for now.

RATING: 7
Well the b/f has been incredibly excited by this one, spending his day off this week reading the rules and then the following evening we gave it a go 3 player. 

its interesting, It had the card driven hand management system reminiscent of mage knight, the kill everything that moves feel similar to galaxy defenders and the health/card system very similar to gears of war but the rules are actually pretty simple and streamlined. 

I like that thee is a trait deck for each scenario whereby the 'artifacts' grow and change throughout the game providing different strategies you need to adopt in order to be successful in your mission, and as it is a deck of cards different ones will be used in each game therefore the 'artifacts' should never evolve the same way twice, ensuring great replayability regardless of mission.

the monster die seems quite heavily weighted in the monsters favour with the majority moving twice each turn resulting in them being able to move the length of the board (as they ignore difficult terrain as well).... but that does ensure you remain in the fight all the time.

Looking forward to playing again... and I doubt the b/f will be able to wait long befroe this hits the table again

RATING: 5
Could be fun with expansions, but they don't really correct the repetetive gameplay itself, just give more stuff to fight and toss onto characters. Everything seems pretty slick until I step away and realize I'm just throwing a few cards down every turn, rolling a couple dice, and in basically every mission, trying to find X object from the 12 locations monsters are coming from. Satisfying at first, mind numbingly dull quickly after.

RATING: 8
Easy ruleset which provides a nice amount of tactical decisions. A miniatures game that is explained in less than 10 minutes, has quick setup time and is not overloaded with tokens etc.!  It is a dungeon crawler simiar game that you can pick up and remember the rules even if you havent played it for months. And thats why I truly love it.

Also, the activation via cards of individual players is fantastic and very streamlined and makes Fire Team Zero much less prone to Alpha Player syndrome and a "real" team battle than other co-op games. try to not communicate too much about your cads on the hands and be ready for some truly team chalenge. 

Minis are okay but not spectacular, but the art is awesome. 

Sweetspot is 3 Players, not sure if it scales well with 2 or 4 players. Gameplay needs lots of communication and probability vs risk analysis to beat but this often ends in very satisfying spectacular moves. People who think the game is too random probably do not give their decisions enough thought: This game is quite hard and takes a lot of anticipiation of moves and options, as well as calculation of dice probability ratio, and deciding where to take a risk and with whom. Also: The theme is incredibly well implemented. It really feels like you are a team that constantly gets attacked by otherworldy demons who never stop spawning!

My only negative: Yes, I think replayability, as it is, is a bit limited once you whent trhough the missions of the core box and expansions. As it is, it will will need new elements & mechanics to keep it interesting long-term. At the same I do think it has all the potenital to do so.

I love this game. Give this one a try - for a first time game by the designers, this is a very impressing product top to bottom!

PS: If you buy an expansion, I recommend to take the europe cycle first as it adds the more interesting new elements to the game.

One of the best Kickstarter Campaigns I backed.  The designers created an outstanding game!  A lot of careful thought and planning was well spent.  The game is actually difficult!  Which is good (to me at least).  This gives it some longevity (in addition to the plethora of extra goodies the Kickstarter Campaign came with - I backed the "Warchest" option).  However, the game plays and unfolds very handsomely as you proceed through the missions.  The art is superb; the designs for the cards, minis, rules layout, and other components are excellent; the narrative is creative; and the timeline is one of the most revered and enjoyable (the game takes place during World War 2).  Hats off and a great load of thanks to the creators of this magnificent game!  This game is one of the few examples of the perfect balance between WW2 action and monster mayhem.  It truly is a lot of fun and very enjoyable!

normally I dont like dice fest games, but this ill make an exception. Why you ask? because of all the amazing tactics cards! I love the tactics cards and battle system! There is  little bit of randomness but I don't mind that to much. 

Some problems, you live and die depending on your teamwork. If you are a player that likes to run around solo, you are going to lose your time the game. This also means you cant really play with people that dont understand a bad move. 

Another problem I have is with ambushes. You know it'll happen when you try to complete an ojective, but there is nothing you can do about it, and usually its going to hit you hard. Possible cost you the game, and that always bothered me.

Besides that, beautiful figures and I love the flavor text and the good ol fighting nazi monster story. Definitley reccomend if you like coops, teamwork, and push your luck type games

Yeah, it's a simplified Gears of War, all right. Make no mistake, they're awfully similar, so I'll just compare them. 

Pluses:
-Better character differentiation.
-More variety in card effects.

Minuses:
-Scenarios are all very samey.
-Health is all very binary, both for monsters and heroes--you're fine or you're dead.
-Components not as good as Gears.

Personally, I prefer Gears.

RATING: 9.3
Pulled out of the Kickstarter as a few alarm bells were ringing, not least, as the outdoor game boards looked like they used my 8 yr old as the art director. But there are rumblings that the game is very fun. £70 is a big gamble. OK, so I've bought it, and although all of the other game art got cleaned up very nicely, those boards still do look awful. There is some big warp-age with them too. One other gripe, card-stock is really quite poor for this day and age, and price point.

The game itself? Well, basically, its brilliant. 
Survival horror, with the emphasis very very firmly on survival. 
You are really hanging on by your fingernails every single round right from the off. And just when you feel you are royally butt f~~ked, another mutated beastie will spawn in, with some nail clippers to make sure.
3 games in, and only once did we just about have the exit in sight, before total inglorious slaughterer reigned down on us once more, big time. But the theme, feel, and gameplay, makes you want to come back for more. Lots more.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The components are good, as you would expect from a Kickstarter minis game. I really enjoyed the fluff and flavor provided by the cards; some really creepy moments worthy of Betrayal at House on the Hill. The dice system gives a unique feel to each type of attack and the cards as health mechanic can lead to tough decisions.

Unfortunately, the rest of the game seems mired in mediocrity to me. Several times we carefully planned our movements and tactically positioned ourselves only to have a random event completely undo the minutes of planning we spent. You lose the scenario if you die two times, but the game will often do an event that effectively gives you an automatic death, no matter how well you plan. Killing monsters is very unsatisfying since they are all guaranteed to be back the next turn. Scenarios are repetitive (search these 12 locations) and swingy (the first three or the last three you search might be what you need). Players are often left feeling like they have no options and the game is jerking them around. At times this is both dull and frustrating.

All that said, it’s an experience. A difficult one, but one that will encourage teamwork among the players leading to good group dynamics. Even if you hate the randomness, at least you can all hate it together. Personally, I just don’t see pulling this out over Zombicide, The Others, the D&D Board Games, etc. As one other commenter so aptly put it, this game is “a one trick pony in a stable with too many other interesting horses.”

Like a blend of Gears of War board game and Shadows of Brimstone. Great miniatures and tiles.  Very challenging, but fun!!  Nice production quality!  If I was to pay this much for a board game, all board games should contain miniatures of this quality.  Sadly, this is not the case.

Awesome co-op game, really well balanced. Simple mechanics yet you can take up to half an hour to plan the next rounds.
The fireteam zero is insanely well equipped for the mission, but the creatures never stops spawning, so it's just a matter of repelling endless waves of attack while trying to complete the objectives as fast as you can and get the hell out of there.

After failing the same scenario 2 times in a row because of bad dice rolls, I had to update my review from 10 to 9.

Watched the rules video, looks good overall, similar idea to Defenders of the Realm or Ravenloft (and a bunch of others - co-op vs. monsters game on a map) but done quite differently and probably better than both for different reasons. Not sure if there is anything to really explore so to speak though, but like the cardplay aspect.  

Edit - watched some of the gameplay video, seems a lot like Ravenloft with an added hand management aspect, not sure there is enough added on to make it worth adventuring into (doesn't look to be for me).

Definitely difficult (almost absurdly so).

As a result, I didn't care for the game very much, although I would play it again if asked.  Played a full 3 mission campaign, so this is not a one-off opinion.

Top notch components, and a lot of them. Great artwork, clear symbols, especially the map tiles. I'm very pleasantly surprised by this.
Clever mechanics and combat. First mission wasn't all too difficult, but it escalates quite quickly after that.
A bit disappointed by the lack of progression though. 1 tactic and 1 upgrade per mission isn't really that exciting, especially since there are so many different cards to choose from. I understand we're not meant to feel like overpowered badasses, since the game is more about survival. But now the players feel very underpowered.
EDIT: I was mistaken. There might not be a lot of progression, but the choices are meaningful, and your power does increase noticably.

This game is quite fun the first three missions you play. The atmosphere the game creates with the encounter cards that you reveal are really almost as good as the events in Betrayal at the House on the Hill. The gameplay is smooth and challenging for the a coop. Unfortunately, after the 3 game you start getting a feeling that all the missions are pretty much the same with small changes here and there. it even usually plays out the same. While I enjoyed the concept, the mechanisms in the game, and the theme of the game there just wasn't enough to keep my interest through a whole campaign. If they start putting something new out for it I might take a second look but right now Fireteam Zero you are almost a one trick pony in stable with too many other interesting horses.

Tough to beat for sure, I was a little worried about the lack of scenarios, but we have yet to beat the first one 3 players yet. The theme is enjoyable but doesn't really feel like Weird War 2, it could truly be any sort of folks fighting monsters. Not sure how to make it feel more WWII like. 

Quicker to play than Imperial Assault and fully co-op probably means it will hang around for those nights when Imperial Assault might be too much.

After 10 plays, I don't know what to think of this game.  It is repetitive and can be a bit of a slog at times.  There seems to be so much potential in the card play and can be really satisfying to work with your teammates.  I think the game would be way more exciting if it was more than just searching locations over and over.  I can't see this ever being one of my favorites games, but I feel like somebody could take some of the ideas from this game and make something great.  

Will not be a game that's pulled out often, but the rules are so simple that it should be perfect for occasional play.  It's just a tad bit too light for me to enjoy playing more frequently.  Definitely not a long term keeper.

So far, everybody I've played this with greatly prefers the Gears of War board game over Fireteam Zero.  The new Doom board game also has really great card play, but you have to enjoy 1 vs many games and not just coop.

The multiple use of the cards is good and the miniatures are nice, but the coin flip mechanic isn't all that great or fun. I really liked the limited monsters and monster placement.

RATING: 8
Incredible game. My wife and I love Zombicide and Dungeon crawlers, and this was an instant hit in our house. The precision and tactics offered by the card combat are a welcome addition. Will update when the expansion come in from the Kickstarter. One thing I can tell you from the core set is if you don't stick together/work together actively the game is brutally difficult. Players truly looking to cooperate will find the experience rewarding, Players that like to lone wolf will find things remarkably difficult for themselves and their team.

I played two games using the preproduction copy.  The game really promotes cooperation which is needed to complete each mission. The components look great and the gameplay is solid.  Each character has their own deck of cards that can be played for combat or react to situations including helping other players.  Hand management is important though because the number of cards in your hand also represent your hit points.

This game feels like Gears of War 2.0.  It has a lot of mechanisms I love from GoW, but takes them in a fresh new direction (alternative WW2 history).  The part that may make this game push Gears to the background is that there are big box expansions coming, something GoW never had.

RATING: N/A
Amazing components!! Miniatures are beautiful, highly detailed and robust. The box is huge but pratical to store (the same format as Zombicide but a bit higher). The quality of cards and tokens is very good. And you have a CD to run to give the atmosphere to your mission. I can't wait to play the game!

I want this game. I want it for the streamlined mechanics and quick gameplay, and for its fantastic, meaty background. But I hate the fact it uses large miniatures instead of small ones (or better yet, tokens) and the associated enormous cost bump and hand-painting requirement. I also detest the default KS approach of splitting all the content into bite-sized portions to purchase separately. Finally, at some point during development they dumped the excellent, unique stylized artwork they had originally, replacing it with the one they released it with which is incredibly generic and forgettable.

+ Great minis, cool tiles
+ Relatively simple rules that can easily be memorized
+ A solid theme; all missions have their own unique feel to them

- Replayability remains to be seen...
- Sudden deaths (though maybe I've just been too careless!)

Works well in solo, but I'd recommend to control 3 heroes rather than only 2...
3 can be a handful, but it gives better game balance than 2.

Tolles unverbrauchtes Thema und grandiose Miniaturen. Der kooperative Aspekt ist höher als in anderen Spielen und es benötigt tadellose Kommunikation, das Szenario zu überstehen.

This is a first rating for it after 4 plays. I saw the worst and medium way of the game. I still hope to see the thing where your on your edge of wits as a team and then bring up a trump card and safe the day and everybode is releasing the adrenalin and be happy to safe the world.

Until then it is a standard good game. Nothing special but solid. The Cards and dice add a lot of random bad luck to the game but the THEME is sooo good and thats why i dont understand this is not delivered with the mechanics.

This game is like the Lucky Coin 1 -> 1 Side is good / the other is the bad one!

RATING: 8
A constant barrage of baddies makes this game very stressful at times. Team cooperation is necessary to balance who is attacking and who is going to take damage when the enemy inevitably breaks the line of defense.

All of the different enemy types and hero upgrade cards help keep this an unpredictable and exciting game. The expansions add a whole lot more.  Only wish there were a couple more heroes to choose from.

Excellent tactical game, one of the best of its type. Pure cooperative (possibly the most cooperative game I've ever played), and with constant strong tactical choices. It requests from players a constant evaluation of the game, and forces them to collaborate in order to succeed each turn. Musn't be misunderstoond and played as if it's another Gears of War. It must be played differently. I also think it's a much better game than GoW. I've read some complains about a supposed lack of variety of weapons, enemies, or the constant re-spawn of the monsters. I think all of this makes the game even better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
If I could rate this higher I would... If you are looking for a true coop experience where you REALLY REALLY have to work together, than this is it... An extremely visceral, heart pounding thematic ride!

It certainly fills my void since GOW!

RATING: 6.75
the first game was lost in less than 2 turns. The second game dragged on for too long... there was some interesting aspects and it is somewhat polished  but there is also a feeling something is missing. I certainly did not have a feeling that it as world war II. The deck does not refresh fast enough and if your special ability is used in the first turn you are left hanging dry, passively reacting rather than positively engaging.

For trade - set of miniatures (and stat cards) for all 5 standard monster sets (3 from base game and 2 from the Africa and a Europe cycle expansions)

Please note, the base game and other game content are not available for trade, just the sets of monster minis (I have two sets but will never play a two squad game and will therefore not need these!)

Bit on the fiddly side and a pain to set-up but nice and tactical given it's relatively simple mechanics. Fan of the card = health mechanic (similar to Gears of War). Don't think I've managed to get all of the rules right in any playthrough yet! Expansions add some needed diversity I think. Two squad game strikes me as overly long and fiddly so no intersect in trying out that variant!

Any game where at the end of a mission, I actually do a fistpump is a good game in my book. It can be tough an unforgiving, but the rules are easy to learn and teach, and the gameplay is tactical enough. Better than Zombicide, not quite up to GoW (but very close).

Plays very much like a video game. Fast, tense and each game manages to tell a good story despite there being only a paragraph of narrative on each event card.

I play primarily solo, and I really enjoy FTZ. If you are into the hobby aspect the miniatures paint up nicely too.

Another Kickstarter squad game with minis.

This one required some thought and co-operation between players, but I can't say that I was deeply impressed. As with just about every Kickstarter game, this felt as though it was lacking some polish. Random rolls for respawning (and teleport spots etc) adds replayability, but doesn't do anything for balance.

Better than most, but that isn't saying a whole lot.

Awesome if you have the Kickstarter Warchest Edition. The game gets much more flexibility and variety with the new add ons.
The core game itself is good, but just nine missions and a limited card pool do not make for a high replay value. With expansions the game really shines. 
The one criticism I have is that - if you focus on your play and think your moves through - you'll win 99 % of the time. But it's hard work ;)

[thing=149776][/thing] is an odd game to me: it lacks originality, and not even its setting, which is unsual for board games, is truly original as it very similar to the origin and comics of Hellboy. And, yet, I liked it.

The way the game works is simple and direct: each character has an unique (well, almost) deck. Cards are used to attack, to react against threats and also serves as health: when taking damage, the player discards a number of cards equal to the damage dealt - if the damage is higher than the what the person can discard, the character is knocked down - and if this happens twice in a scenario (before completing a goal or other situation that allows an extra life to be gained), the mission is lost. Players win by fufilling the specific conditions of each scenario. 

In her turn, the player can move her pc up to two spaces (the type of terrain can reduce this), and do one action, usually attack or explore, but there are other kinds of special actions (from cards, goals, focus, etc) that eventually the person can do. Overall, [thing=149776][/thing] is pretty clean and neat, fast to learn and easy enough to play.

The biggest difficulty is the hand management - both because of the timming and the way (for the effect or the dice to attack) to use them, and also how many to use - the more cards played in an attack, better are the odds, and since the enemies must be killed promptly (there is no damage that stays on them), you want to have the better odds. Yet, this makes the character more vulnerable to attacks (cards are their life). It is a thin line between attacking and defending, and the players must walk above it the whole time.

[thing=149776][/thing] has a great production regarding the miniatures, art and markers; and the theme is well applied, with the written parts being competent and allowing for a good mood.

In spite of being a scenario and minis game, a combo that normally leads to long and boring set ups, everything is done in [thing=149776][/thing] surprisingly fast, as it is just a matter of putting a few map tiles together, taking the character decks, adding a few more cards and markers, and we are ready to go. All takes around 15 to 20 minutes - and is very appreciated.

In the end, although [thing=149776][/thing] truly lacks a point that takes it out of the curve - there is little to no innovation or a sensational part -, the whole is bigger than the sum of its parts: the play is easy going (in pacing, not difficulty), the actions are clear cut, as well as the use of the cards. The enemies don't even have an AI: all they want (at least the most common) is fight, and there is always more of them coming. It is mayhem and destruction, a total war. The gameplay has complexity (in the hand management, positioning, coordinating actions); however, it doesn't bog down the play, and the end result is everyone having fun. Approved.

Rated a 9 after first game; nicely streamlined rules and thematic event cards. Looking forward to next play! Oh and we lost! (2 player)

Increased to a 10 by our third game. The different missions and event cards produce an incredibly thematic game with lots of tactical decisions to be made. Superb!

Dropped back down to a 9 after 6 plays as it does get a bit samey if you play it too often. Suspecting the expansions may change this?

This is a great game for gamers who like area control. I find area control to be frustrating. I do appreciate the excellent production and the game play mechanisms although I’d have to agree with another comment that said the quests do not seem to offer enough reward.

Abstract:
Area control, dudes on the map game with stellar, high quality minis which is a mix of sci-fi-look and greek mythology.

Pros:
+ Great components and artwork
+ Different win conditions (not only area-control, no victory points)
+ Different factions (but not asymmetric)
+ Special actions board like in Kemet (forces to do diverse actions)
+ Faction upgrade-tracks like in Blood Rage
+ Drafting for blessing cards to specialized your faction (asymmetric factions over the course of the game)
+ NPC monsters
+ Randomize monsters, quests on game set-up makes each game feel differently.
+ Combat via cards
+ Conquered ares are prone to sneak attacks behind the enemy line which shakes up stalemates.

Neutrals:
# Not sure about the balance
# Combat against NPC monsters is quite random, but has tension in it
# After one has failed to defeat a monster, other players can easily defeat it

Cons:
- A bit fiddly due to a lot of mechanics and components 
- Rules are sometimes confusing (e. g., colors)

Thoughts:
This one reminds me to Kemet (blessings, special actions, card driven combat, tempels) - Lords of Hellas is not as elegant because it has more mechanics and takes twice as long. What I especially like here is the different win conditions and the randomized game set-up.

Similar to:
* Kemet (more elegant and balanced)

Player: 2-4 (up to 6 with expansions) | Time: 60-240m

I understand all the fuss around this game, with Kickstarter and huge awesome miniatures involved.
It was a pretty big disappointment, though.

RULES: they’re quite well written, with a few unclear spots (but nothing too worrying: it will probably get FAQed very soon). They’re however, a mash up of many smaller sub-systems, with lots of lesser things to remember that didn’t seem to add anything to gameplay.

AESTHETICS: the monuments and monsters are quite beautiful. The rest of the miniatures are a bit meh. The map is large and pleasant. The rest of the components feel very lacking in this regard, with sub-par artwork on many cards and no artwork on many other cards!

GRAPHIC DESIGN AND ERGONOMICS: this is probably the major drawback... almost no game information is conveyed by the components! The grey miniatures are too big for the (very large map), cards and monster sheets are not easily readable or understandable from afar (and you need a very big table for this game!).

GAMEPLAY: like many dudes on a map games, there seems to be quite a bit of kingmaking involved. The many subsystems feel sparse, collated from different games and put together without too much polishing or external play testing.
Quests seem underwhelming and completely removable from the game. The combat system is actually two different systems (one against monsters and one different against other players) and both don’t offer any great decision point. Heroes powers feel drastically unbalanced (Helena?!?) and tend to dictate your strategy...

Lords of Hellas IMHO is the quintessential Kickstarter product: much chrome in the minis, underdeveloped ruleset, a bitter taste in the mouth...

Will gladly play again just to see what I missed there, and the avanche of players giving this a 10 sees...

Absolutely garbage business practices. I’m one of many Retailer backers in the US that didn’t receive their shipment. Now the game is shipping worldwide and multiple customers cancelled orders due to the fact that I cannot provide the game in a timely fashion. When I contacted the backer page I was told to wait longer. When I demanded a refund magically my order was moved to “ready to ship” status and I was informed that once it’s ready to ship it can’t be cancelled. This is the last time I’ll ever back Awaken Realms.

First play, great! Second and third plays, game started to feel samey, and the flaws were showing through.

First up, the good points. The three win conditions fighting over the map in different ways is a neat spatial abstract puzzle. Building the statues is also a neat timer, reminding me a it of Argent and Lacerta games.

The monsters and quests, easily the most fun thematic parts of the game on paper, are pretty lazy mechanical tack-ons. They don't feel thematic at all, and mechanically - the monsters in particular - are pretty clunky.

The variable player powers are boring. +1 Power, +1 Speed. It's uninteresting and lazy. Ditto for the special power drafting. Clearly the powers aren't balanced, which is why you have a draft (to let player interaction fix the balance, ala Cosmic Encounter). End result, some powers are great, others are highly situational.

Overall, the game's dominated by random draws, the theme feels pasted on, and the best parts would fit better in an abstract game. Which sounds scathing - it's not. It's just in an unfortunate position of being yet another area control game in a genre full of them.

If you want mythology and combat, get Kemet. It's cheaper, and just way better game overall. If you want lots of cool mythological minis with an alright game attached, get this game, I guess.

(Note: Also, as with most area control games, the 2p variant is mediocre at best. Don't bother with it unless you're playing with 4.)

This is the definition of gamers' game. It is a nice mixture of good area control games' mechanics. Including Kemet, Inis, Cry Havoc etc. This means it is more complex than those.

Not quite pre-ordered but backed on Kickstarter.
Because copy/paste:
Kickstarting, and feel compelled to offset unfair 1 ratings by people who don't seem to understand the difference between ethics and marketing. Using child labor to manufacture your product is unethical; using kickstarter exclusives to promote engagement with your KS is marketing. It's okay if you don't like KS exclusives as a marketing strategy, and you should feel free to shout from the mountain tops about that. Giving a game a 1 rating just because you don't like kickstarter exclusives and you know it will hurt the perception of the actual gameplay on BGG actually IS unethical, based on the standard definition of the word.

Pleasantly surprised by this one.  The theme is unique and interesting.  Game play goes quite quickly with plenty of meaningful decisions.  The ability to potentially control the monsters on the board places a nice twist on things by adding a small degree of randomness.  Components are excellent.  Some rules are not clear.  Quests, thus far, have been underwhelming, some even confusing as to their requirements.  Still, very excited for the rest of the Kickstarter stretch goals to arrive.  The replayability, which already seems good, should be incredibly bolstered with the introduction of new characters, Gods, and boards.

Ciężka sprawa... Na pewno, co się rzuca w oczy, to wykonanie. Monumenty są zdecydowanie przesadzone, a służą właściwie po nic, podczas gdy figurki hoplitów są średnie, a żetony świątyń w porównaniu do reszty wręcz rażą.
Mechanicznie jest całkiem dobrze, różne warunki wygranej. Ale na minus boląca czasem losowość w kartach walki oraz efekt kuli śnieżnej i możliwość wyeliminowanie kogoś doszczętnie.
Blood Rage, Kemet czy Inis to gry jednak lepsze.

Figurki. Cybernetyczni herosi/kosmici budują równie cybernetycznym bogom/kosmitom pomniki walcząc przy pomocy troszkę mniej cybernetycznych żołnierzy (chyba nie kosmitów) o panowanie nad jak największą ilością terenów, napotykając przy tym mitologiczno-cybernetyczno-kosmiczne potwory. Figurki. Dwa pudła komponentów za 370zł + dwie przesyłki (w sześciopakach taniej). Jedni uważają że funta kłaków nie warta, a inni dali 1,7M funta w ciemno. Figurki. Polska wersja (pierwsze pudło) jak dobrze pójdzie, będzie na walentynki, sg też w języku polskim (drugie pudło), może w wakacje 2018r. Choć nie można wykluczyć że wszystko na raz będzie w wakacje - ot ks. Warto wspomnieć o figurkach! ;) Podobno uniwersum kosmicznych bogów to pomysł M.Oracza.
23.01.2018 chyba raczej nie będzie na walentynki, rozsyłają już wersję ang ale tłumaczenia niby już zrobione teraz produkcja i wysyłka więc coraz bardziej realny dzień kobiet, a i wiosna możliwa. Drugie pudło raczej jesień, jak dojdzie na gwiazdkę, to też się nie zdziwię.

A very good game, smartly combining area control strategy with a light adventure aspect.
Gameplay becomes deeper and more enjoyable each time.

Please keep in mind two important things with this review:
1 – We were not able to complete an entire game (yet)
2 – I Kickstarted this game and am very excited about it, so my impression may be slightly biased

Review

Packaging 
1 – The box is sturdy
2 – The components to the game fit nicely, and are protected from damage while transporting the game
3 – It is sized similar to many FFG games, which will fit many gamers game section perfectly
4 – It has great artwork on the top and all the side facings which is good for merchandising
5 – The back of the box is very attractive and informative

Components
1 – The plastic player piece sculpts are impressive for Board Game miniatures
2 – The monument sculpts are fantastic, there are a few imperfections, but multi-part resin models are difficult to create and they’ve done a great job
3 – The monster sculpts are amazing, I’ve seen miniature companies produce models of lesser detail and quality
4 – The player boards and tokens are high quality, printed in vivid colour with incredible art
5 – The Rulebook(s) are well printed, clear, artful, and not too many pages, so they shouldn’t intimidate first time players
6 – The game board is sturdy, well illustrated, and very well laid out. I love double sided game boards.

Terrain Pack
Fantastic! This really adds to the feel of the game, and brings more 3D to the board

Game Play
I really enjoyed playing this game. The multiple victory conditions and different character abilities make the game interesting and challenging.
There are too many strategies to metagame right away, which is fantastic in my opinion.
I’m looking forward to playing again.

Summary
Great looking figures and artwork.
Not complicated to learn, but will take a long time to master.

Played, there were a lot of good systems here, but nothing super in-depth. It felt formulaic, but not necessarily in a bad way. Above average for sure but I'm not sure I would buy it.

Still really getting the feel for the game, but positive about it so far. Less complicated than it first appears and I like the monster hunt and combat mechanics. The hoplite and priest models are a little disappointing in scale and mold. but larger models are very good.

Very well made area control/war game with a great theme. After a few plays, the game starts to show its true depth...highly recommended.

RATING: 8
The gameplay is very nice, lots of ways to win the game and many opportunities for players to stop others winning so fast. There are so many things to do that trying to do everything will set you back quite a bit (unless everyone lese does it too). Interaction between players is required especially  with 4 players (I feel that with 3 players there might be too much space ...). Spamming with a single action is usually not that easy which is great. I like the idea that heroes can move regardless of other heroes/monsters/hoplites and only hoplites clash.

The characters feel unbalanced though, I'm almost sure that Heracles is better than Helena (not certain about others but Achilles feels weak too).

The graphical design and symbols are good and quite clear, it's easy to remember what does what after one game, and edge cases are addressed in the rulebook reasonably well.

Unfortunately the quality of miniatures is very poor (compared to e.g. Bloodrage, Warhammer, Warmachine, Pandemic Cthulu or even Scythe). The monuments are better but different parts don't fit very well (e.g. 0.5cm gaps ...). Even the bottoms of bases look like they were made in someone's basement. Exected something much better, I am really disappointed.

And sundrop ... it's really bad too. It's perhaps better than nothing (perhaps). I suppose it's white spray and some black wash. It seems like it was done in batches with not much regard for quality control. Just sprayed white under some angle and diped in the wash, voila . On many minis (like all red priests/hoplites) the black wash substance is so dense that it hasn't dried fully ( I guess). It looks obnoxious and minis are sticky ... The white spray was also applied en masse and not very carefully. As for hoplites, blue and yellow ones look decent with white spray, greens are not bad but .... red ones are just pink.... Additionally the sundrop highlights all imperfections of minis (like excess plastic where moulds were joined) ... and you cannot clean them after cause itll look even worse. I know that they couldn't afford to pay much attention to every single mini but the process they designed gives very shitty results ... I am quite sure that I'd make it look much better with two afternoons and an airbrush.

The box is also too small and not really ergonomic. Cards with sleeves do not fit and miniatures are very likely to collide and break/bend when the box is move.

Still, it's a great game, pleasing to eye and seems highly replayable. One of my favourites recently.

The sculpts in this game are absolutely amazing. I love the monuments, and that each faction's units and hero are unique sculpts. The game play is streamlined and the multiple paths to victory make this game a favourite.

Kickstarter exclusives for boardgames are unethical: they push you to buy the game, by taking advantage of your fear to not get them. This behaviour makes me lose every interest for such games, and makes me dislike them. That's why I rate them 1 and explain the reasons in the comments. If it happens the same to you, rate 1 such games (including this one) and paste this comment.

I like the Shadow of the Colossus-style game play, but the winning conditions seem to be a bit unfocused and at odds with each other. Granted this keeps anyone from doubling down on any one condition, but it does require you to cover all your bases. Overall I thought it was fine, but not quite on the level of a Blood Rage or Chaos in the Old World.

I will not rate the game until i get my copy and play it,
but it is annoying to see people rating 1 and crying that KS are unethical.

KS gives u the option to buy something with less money than the retail price and with more components.
KS helps people to create games they dreamed.
KS are an option that no1 forces u to take, u can go and buy it later if u want.

The minis, especially the multi-piece monuments (that are constructed during the game) are what drew me to the game, but the game play is very good as well. Multiple paths to victory (kill 3 monsters, control 2 different color region, control a territory of a completed monument, etc.) and a built in timer once any monument is built (game ends in 3 turns after). The card combat is interesting, not what I typically like to play but it works well. Having a chance to roll the die to determine what each monster does was fun!

Because copy/paste:
Kickstarting, and feel compelled to offset unfair 1 ratings by people who don't seem to understand the difference between ethics and marketing. Using child labor to manufacture your product is unethical; using kickstarter exclusives to promote engagement with your KS is marketing. It's okay if you don't like KS exclusives as a marketing strategy, and you should feel free to shout from the mountain tops about that. Giving a game a 1 rating just because you don't like kickstarter exclusives and you know it will hurt the perception of the actual gameplay on BGG actually IS unethical, based on the standard definition of the word.

:):) Fantastic production and theme

:):) Hunting monsters is fun
:) Three ways to win is exciting and tense as game goes on
:) Interesting and clean action selection
:) Epic feel in 2 hours or less
:) Lots of special powers given out at a steady pace
:) Heroes are a very fun twist to area control
:) You have different reasons for wanting to control different parts of the map

:soblue: Unsure how 2p and 3p will play
:soblue: Downtime can be an issue if lots of hunts are happening
:soblue: Poor male to female ratio in every aspect of the game
:soblue: Bad rulebook (we had to majority vote some minor things)
:soblue: Sparta shouldn't have been at the bottom of the map
:soblue: Late game it can be hard to remember everyone's special abilities
:soblue: Lack of tracking how close players are to winning (will have to make one for temples)

I don't like the artworks and visuals of this game! Why is there a Spacemarine on the front of the box??
Standees as temples

The Greek mythology theme is in general interesting for me, but the gameplay doesn't seem appealing so far. Sure, fighting monsters is a nice idea but the rest ... I don't know. It seems more like Kickstarter cash grabbing than a real game.

A lot of "moving parts" with rules but once you learn it, you'll find the synergy of the mechanics flow rather smoothly. You need to be aware of what the other players are doing as one might sneak up and win one of the four victory conditions. Excellent game. Cool minis.

PnP, played just once.

What I see I would rate as a 8, similar to Cyclades. There are strengths in each of them, but I'm not fully satisfied. Hopefully LoH will be significally improved before release.

The main issues of LoH:

- incredibly unthematic quests
- so-so monsters (on how they are [un]thematic)
- strange usage of temples, priests, monuments and hero advancement

Examples:

- "strong defense", "scouting" etc etc - are these all God's blessings??
- why blessings come from building temples rather than by priests prey?
- why hero stats advance when priests do pray?
- why building Zeus monument in my region gives me nothing?

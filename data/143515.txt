This game on the first play hooked me. The game is real easy to teach. The part I like the best is in this work placement game you don't get locked out of places. All you need to do is spend one more woker that is on the current space.

Your average cube pusher. Not particularly good nor bad. Just average. 

I actually like the mechanics how all players are given the same number of action points. Quite easy to teach and fast to play. However, it's weird how the 4th player in a 4-player game doesn't get to be the starting player.

One of the better worker placement games in a while.  Had a great time!  Order fulfillment is usually a cool thing for me anyway.  Lots of interesting choices, but planning a little will help.  Only negative is the cardboard components are warped a bit, right out of the box...it mars an otherwise top-notch production.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple play.

Coal Baron is yet another elegant, simple but deep Kramer&Kiesling game. I don't really care about the theme, but that's not such a huge deal in my book. I like instead the take the designers took on the worker placement mechanism, where the placement part has been combined with a sort of auction... and I like even more the fact that you get A TON of workers with it. This is might not be something genius, but it for sure feels fresh. This two mechanisms together create a very simple, streamlined and yet deep action selection system, in which your "work-force" really feels like a resource more than in any other game I played so far.

Yet, even if there's nothing to dislike about this game, I don't find myself particularly enjoying it... which sadly it's something that I can say about many Kramer&Kiesling games at this point. Their designs are usually so elegant, deep and perfectly well-balanced... but they also miss that spark, that exciting element that brings the game to the next level for me. It's almost like if I enjoy the singular mechanisms more than the sum of the parts.

Another lesson on board-game design by this highly praised German duo, but also another of their games that fails excite me. Such a pity... again!

This is a light to medium complexity eurogame where you have to mine coal and transport it to fulfill contracts. It has a fairly basic action selection system, with little twist and turns. The scoring system is very nice: each round you score a multitude of things so it does not penalize you that much if you miss out on things. The visuals are a little dark, but what else to exepct when this is a mining themed game.

RATING: 6
A thoroughly well crafted game, as you would expect from Kramer and Kiesling. Indeed, Gluck Auf is reminiscent of the golden age of German games that were mechanically simple, yet offered gamers plenty to chew on.  It only falls short in presenting the players with too few real dilemmas.  The most challenging decisions are about how much can be accomplished before the end of a round.  Beyond that, what needs to be done next and what can be delayed is reasonably clear.  

The production quality of my Pegasus edition is good, except for the paper money.  I was quickly reaching for the poker chips.  The artwork is good by Pegasus standards and evocative of the theme.  The English rules are well written.

Estupendo juego ligero de mineria. No solo hay que sacar minerales de las entrañas de la tierra, sino estar pendiente del numero de galerias que se excavan, el tipo de materiales , el modo de distribucion de los pedidos..

Se juega rápido y se le pilla el tranquillo en pocos turnos.

RATING: 6.5
A very interactive Euro, with opportunity for blocking, and a need to be aware of what everyone else is doing to maximise scoring. Despite the interaction, it feels fairly dry, although the excitement does ramp up towards the end as you start to compete for final scoring bonuses. 

A few things I didn't like: As fulfilled cards are turned face down there is a memory element to this (which cost me dear!) In effect it's something of an area control game where the populations in each area are hidden-- I'd rather they were visible. The blocking (actually increasing the price of actions out of reach) means that you are basically calculating a risk-- do I try to do a lot this turn, and hope the actions are all still cheap enough, or do a bit less knowing I'll be able to afford it come what may? There is the mechanism where you re-arrange four unwanted cards and put them at the top or bottom of the deck: this mechanism usually lengthens games for marginal benefit, and I think it does so here.

So I like the quick playtime and the very interactive nature of the scoring but those other problems just brought the game down a little for me.

A brief worker placement game wherein each player has their very own coal mine. And with different grades of coal!  

Players selectively use action points to place coal cubes on a mine elevator (which is neat), bring the cubes up to the surface, and place them on contract fulfillment cards, which curiously, though significantly, have different modes of transportation associated with them.  Thematically, I did not quite understand why transportation majorities are scored in the game.

Overall, I found Coal Baron quite dry, and the worker placement choices only slightly pleasant to "get."  In this sense, this game reinforces my belief that theme and "fun choices" do matter in a worker placement game.  From a game design point of view, ideally, every single worker placement should be for something that is wanted.  (See, for example, the game design of Agricola or Caverna.)

In this game, because the appropriate coal carts and coal contracts frequently did not arise on the board (or through the "pick from the stack" mechanic) I found myself frequently taking carts and contracts I REALLY did NOT want.  In general, I greatly prefer a game design that avoids such "take your unlucky medicine" results.  Every play should be at least moderately desirable.

If I recall correctly, a famous game designer (I believe it was Wolfgang Kramer) once noted in an interview that a good game design ideally places the players in a place they want to be.  In particular, the art and mechanics should combine to create a place that players want to visit, and spend time within, again and again.  

The task of the game designer is to create such a "gaming world," then ask players to spend time within that world, and ideally, have fun within that world.  Trying to make a coal mine such a place, I admit, is quite a game design challenge, which I think in this case, was (perhaps predictably) not met.

Very light and simple worker placement game. Nothing here is really going to tax your brain but is a neat little optimization and planning game. Can be easily taught to new players and could make a nice gateway game. Unfortunately it wasn't really enough to keep us interested, so we traded it away.

RATING: 8
This reminds us quite a bit of another Kramer and Kiesling game we love; Tikal. Similar but not the same. You assign workers (not really workers in a sense but more like the time each worker uses in the day) to spots to gather coal, distribute that coal, fulfill contracts or just get income. The intriguing part is how you'll use those "workers." The 1st person in a spot gets it for 1 worker. The next players can use that space but they must use 1 more worker than the previously player who placed there. If it was 1 you must use 2. If it was 2 you must use 3 and so on. It makes you think ahead for your moves in a very strategic manner. Plus after each shift you score for certain elements of the game. But you must keep those elements in mind for the future because at the end of each shift you score not just for the current elements but for past elements as well. So you have to plan well and use your workers wisely.

Middleweight, well-designed worker placement game with a modicum of integrated theming.  After a couple of plays, there wasn't anything close to a "best" scoring path that I could see, and the general strategy of "do what the others aren't" is a little opaque to execute too - both good things.  Still, not exciting for me.  But you can probably bang it out in 60 minutes, from memory.

Jópofa, könnyen átlátható, egyszerű kis munkáslehelyezős játék. Tetszik a lehelyezés mechanikája (eggyel több ember kitúrhat), és a liftezés is. Így hogy összesen 3 kör van, kifejezetten rövidnek számít a játék ebben a műfajban. Nálunk volt aki úgy vélte, nehéz behozni azt, aki az elején elhúz, de a részeredményeink nem ezt mutatják. A pontozás elég szélsőséges dolgokat tud produkálni, nagyon lesni kell, mit csinálnak a többiek. Az első parti alapján úgy tűnik, 1-2 szerencsésen megválasztott dologra kell rámenni minden téren, és azokból minél többet megnyerni csont nélkül.

Played as a prototype in the Cordoba International Boardgame Festival, October'12.  I just loved it.  It mixes a kind of worker placement or investment with majority-collection for scoring.  The worker placement has a nice twist: to use a place, you have to put one more worker than the previous one did at that place.  So there's no blocking, but a time decision about where to put your workers, and WHEN.  The lift used to go up and down the mine is just great, and the game overall seemed really great fun for me.  
Final product really nice, although tiles could be a bith thicker.
It works perfectly for 2 players, being really fast.

Kiesling & Kramer are back, with another polished, smooth and clever game!

The "elevator game", as one of my friends dubbed it, is about mining and fulfilling contracts.
It apparently has worker placement as a central mechanic, but the real core is action points and majorities.

A great "old school" game by the wonder-duo. Kramer is definitely one of my favorite designers!

Another elegantly designed game by Kramer and Kiesling that brings nothing innovative or exciting to the table, but nonetheless plays smooth, intuitive and is enjoyable. It has a gatewayish feel about it while still maintaining interesting decisions.

 The game draws you in with the integrated theme, nice art and appropriate components. Another plus is that it plays quick enough that it doesn't become redundant or overstay it's welcome. 

 Coal Baron is good for families and non gamers while still giving gamers food for thought. With the plethora of games in this category, it is still a nice piece to have in your collection.

Good, but unremarkable, worker placement game.  Had it come out in the mid to late 00's it might have been great, but today it is just retreading ground laid by games before it.  I would not choose to play it over Stone Age, Caylus, or even Lords of Waterdeep, so I won't be keeping it.  

The components are of poor quality, and frankly, R&R should be ashamed.  The tiles are thin and warped.  The paper money is all the same size and color regardless of denomination.  It feels like you are playing a prototype, or maybe a $25 FFG Silver Line game - certainly not a $45 production piece.

Players are deploying workers in order to obtain carts full of coal, bring the coal from the carts up to the surface, obtain contracts to deliver that coal to, and finally transportation to fulfill the contracts.  As with any worker placement game, sometimes the actions of your opponents will interfere and cause you to have to play less optimally.

Points are scored for making deliveries, and also for aspects of your mine vs. other players at the end of each round.  Most points after three rounds wins!

A good, light worker placement/optimization game, but nothing that made me too excited or anything very unique.

RATING: 7
The major thing I dislike about Coal Baron is the memorization aspect regarding the points: how many points you score feels a little random as you need to remember what type of cards (goods, wagon) the other players have played… Sure, it’s not “random” in its purest form, but I heavily dislike the memory aspect and there is no doubt it will favor some players. Also, another thing I disliked was how important the last scoring seemed to be, i.e. the empty wagons – further plays will tell.

Now for the good parts: the lift mechanic is very unique (although not quite the “pick up and deliver” mechanic which it states on BGG). It is also a clever idea that the price of the actions increase once players have put meeples on them; you can still get the same action, but it will cost you additional meeples. And, of course, the whole thing about getting the right coal wagons and the right means of transport etc. was what made the game interesting. Although I have to say that the way you need to balance your coal wagons (regarding the light) seemed like an afterthought – it was okay, but not really an element in the game which could not be left out. It did mean that you had to think a lot more to get the right wagons, and you could probably block even more with them which is always something I like.

The game is quite fast with 4 - it took about an hour with 4 new players which is very positive. It’s not a game I need to own, though; it’s not a bad game, but yet one of those fairly good games which gets a rating of 6-7. Nothing spectacular, but I would play it from time to time.

Rated 7 after one play. I've been in pursuit of a family-friendly worker placement game. All the worker placement games I own are relatively complex and not exactly geared to the lighter gamer.

After one play, I'd say I really enjoyed this game. It plays smoothly, the rules are relatively straightforward, there's plenty to think about, etc. The only thing remaining is that I need to actually play it with casual gamers to see how approachable it really is.

One knock on the components--those player boards and inserts really due warp. Ugh. It's pretty pronounced and disappointing.

Update: traded this one away for Edo. My wife was ambivalent about this game, and that sealed the deal. It's pleasant enough to play, but not good enough for me to campaign to get it to the table. And man... those components. The bland paper money, the warped boards, the thin tiles... the game deserves better treatment than this first printing. It's outclassed component-wise by most games getting published now.

I thought the game was pretty interesting and wouldn't mind playing it again, but ultimately thought it was only okay and rather dry. All the scoring in the 3 shifts felt like work and didn't enjoy how it was all majority based. Over two-thirds of our scores were based on the majorities as opposed to completed contracts. I think a more even split would have been better. The coal shaft mechanic is definitely neat and I enjoyed it, but that really was about it.

The simplicity of this game might turn some people off, but for me it's a great introduction to the worker placement genre. Flows very smoothly, plays well with 3-4, and can easily be taught in 5-10 minutes. Not too deep, but there is definitely some strategy there. I recommend it.

Glück Auf can profit from the facts that I like mining themes as well as worker placement games. Glück Auf has both but unfortunately the game's mechanism is more lightweigt and the theme is more superficial than I had hoped for. Nonetheless I have fun playing it and the light worker placement mechanism especially works great for occasional gamers. Glück Auf is explained quickly and the combination of game mechanisms and production chain theme makes the rules easy to grasp. Still despite being beautifully illustrated, the theme is arbitrary and crude in many details. For example, there is a bank that hands out money just for showing up early. And a weird "lorry factory" seems to have specialized in producing non-refillable lorries already loaded with coal wich it then buries deep below the surface for you to hoist. However, the one big issue of the game is its runaway leader problem: Basically you score points for fulfilling order cards which you then collect to score even more bonus points three times during a game. So by tendency, whoever has the most fulfilled orders will have the most points and will also score the most bonus points. A bad start will ruin your score. (This is for the eggertspiele / Pegasus Spiele German edition (2013).)

Pretty decent light-ish game by the masters K&K. And fo rme I think I have a soft spot for them. 20+ years of cranking out the hits. Ridiculous. And staying true to themselves, rather than going the Knizia route of money grab for mass market (read: dumbed down) games. What's interesting here is that there are only three rounds, and there's a scoring after each round, but after 1 you only score category A, round 2, A+B, and round 3 A+B+C. The actual gameplay of each round is pretty straight-forward. It's worker placement, and your worker pool is non-growable. Other players don't block action spaces per se, but they make them more expensive. Every action space requires 1 more worker than the number already there (which if any, get bumped to a holding bin until end of round). The only thing I'm not too sure about is the money spaces, which I think are a little too differentiated. It makes it the automatic go-to first action by at least the first two players--at least in rounds 1&2. The mineshaft spaces spaces are also highly differentiated, but at least players may or may not be ready to use it at the same time, so there's not a simultaneous rush to it. The money thing makes turn order pretty important, but the turn order system is fairly hard to control. Anyway, overall it flows really well. And of course like most games with hidden/trackable information, I ignore that rule. I play with completed order face up. Critics of open cards will say that the game takes longer, which is true, but there's just not enough game there if you don't know who has what majorities for scoring; and if it's hidden it's too much for me to remember.

Glück Auf was not a game I [i]needed[/i] to play: what Kramer & Kiesling produce these days (at the time of writing) is not really anymore an instant auto-try, let alone an auto-buy. But if the opportunity presents itself, I'm not going to pass it up.

Physically the game reminded me much of the earlier Magnum Sal: the similarities of mine tunnels extending sideways from a central shaft, and transporting mined minerals to the surface, are hard to miss. But the games play out very differently, a Good Thing. Magnum Sal is a mean game of timing and making good use of another's hard work in clearing a tunnel; Glück Auf lets you mine on your own in your own tunnel system and relegates the interaction to the surface activities. The idea in Glück Auf is that by placing workers on an action space (hello worker placement) you get to do one of several things, such as 'discovering' new ore veins, movement points to haul ore to the surface, and selling these off using a variety of transport means. The twist in the WP is that you can reuse an action space by placing one more worker on it, creating a competitive but still quite friendly game of timing exortion. If you wait too long you might not have sufficient workers to pay for an action. If you wait too short you are likely not going to be all that efficient in converting stuff to VP. Experienced gamers will hardly require a lengthy explanation here. VP are eventually obtained by determining several majorities (type of coal sold, type of transport used, and number of mine carriages), which get added as well as added [i]to[/i] over the course of the three major game phases. 

The game itself is... not particularly remarkable. It is, however, well-developed, and plays out very quickly and smoothly. Everything you expect to be in there is there; everything you do not need has been taken out. There is one 'but', though: The timing of hauling up coal and delivering it can require an exceedingly fine nose as the end approaches, something I'm not sure is in harmony with the game's apparently carefree attitude which gets you by for at least the first two-and-a-half part out of three. You don't get to make mistakes at this point, in any case. Perhaps that is as intended, and perhaps it isn't. You'll have to be your on judge.

For me personally Glück Auf is another example of a NFOEW title. Not bad in any way, but not sufficiently  memorable or challenging to lay out on the table time after time again too. It will probably be a long time since I play this game anew.

RATING: 7
Streamlined, non-complex introduction to worker-placement games. Coal Baron does not reinvent or innovate on any tried and true mechanics in the genre, but delivers pleasant and satisfying quick gameplay with easily grasped but non-trivial decisions. Shifts (=rounds) start at a leasurely pace then ramp up the tension and (indirect) player-interaction as actions spaces become increasingly expensive. The theme is quite fresh and fits the mechanics nicely. Zipping around in the mine-lift never gets old.

Played a prototype in Festival Internacional de Juegos de Cordoba 2012 and later the Spanish version october 2013. Really nice eurogame. It takes about an hour. Is not a worker placement game, more of an investment/drafting game. 

Each turn the players get a fixed ammount of workers (which is the most important currency) to carry out actions, which mix both drafting resources (mining licenses and contracts) and executing actions (moving coal, getting money and delibering contracts). You have to invest your workes to maximize profit. One important difference with respect to other investment games such as Hawaii of Saint Petersburg, is that you don't get more workers in any action, so everybody has the same capital each turn. This moves the objective of the game from an economic engine building, to profit estimation, taking into account that the value of the investment is decided by mayorities, and hence highly depends on the rest of the players investments.

High interaction, fast and really fun game.

In Coal baron gaat u proberen om punten te scoren door contracten te vervullen. De contracten wensen van u een bepaalde samenstelling van kolen die u uit uw mijnschacht gaat halen. U gaat moeten graven, kolen naar bovenhalen en op een contract plaatsen, alles uitleveren en als het even kan nog snel langs de bank lopen om wat geld binnen te krijgen.

Op het speelbord zijn er vijf verschillende acties beschikbaar. Je gaat kunnen delven in je mijn en nieuwe kolenblokjes krijgen. Je kan in je mijn gaan werken, kolen bovenhalen en contracten vervullen. Je kan contracten gaan uitleveren. Je kan geld gaan afhalen in de bank en tenslotte kan u ook nieuwe contracten binnen gaan halen. Indien u een actie wenst uit te voeren, plaatst u een arbeider bij het overeenkomstige vakje. Het leuke aan dit spel is dat de acties niet verdwijnen als iemand anders deze reeds heeft uitgevoerd. Ook volgende spelers kunnen de actie uitvoeren, ze betalen gewoon één arbeider meer om dit te doen.

Nation, I'm here to give a Coal Baron report, and the word of the day is "solid".  Nothing really spectacular here, but I did enjoy trying to plan ahead to be in on the end of round points.  I didn't realize during the first play just how powerful second places would be.  I'll have to pay attention to that when I play again, which I'm hoping I get to do.  I also really enjoyed the action selection mechanism, which felt like a logical successor to Diamonds Club.

Coal Baron is a good solid elegant Worker Placement from Kramer and Keisling. The interesting mechanism is that you can use the same action as another player but you have to place one extra worker than is already present on the spot. Whilst Kramer and Keisling don't get me fired up in wide-eyed awe and anticipation as I do with a Feld game, there is no doubt that they are consistently putting out Top quality, very elegantly designed games which play quickly and smoothly. And common to all their recent games (Coal Baron, Palaces of Carrera and Nauticus) are continual tough and interesting decisions.

 Most impressive and plays in an hour or so.

A téma nagyon jól fel van építve. Átélhető a xx. század eleji bányászat, ahogy az volt, logikusan jól felépítve.
H is müxiket már leírtam anno az esseni listán itt:
www.boardgamegeek.com/listitem/2685362?commentid=4014025#comment4014025

Ami akkor nem volt feltűnő, játszva már igen:
Az értékelés vhogy mindig ugyanazokat értékeli, azaz a 3 műszak alatt bejövő új értékelések is ugyanazt értékelik, de máshogy. Vagyis ez látszott a szabályból, de hogy ez mennyire jól van egymásra építve az nem. Nagyon jól.
Nekem teszik a munkásoknál 1-gyel többért ugyanoda, különösen, h el kell dönteni, h mi mennyire fontos, hisz egyre drágább lesz minden. És hát ugye fix a munkás szám(4 főnél 13). Itt nagyobb az interaktivás, a "kitolás faktor", nagyon nem mindegy, h mikor mit csinál az ember, h mennyi munkás szán rá, és h tudja véghez vinni azt amit akar.

sok féle út lehet, h ki merre és hogy, és mi messze nem próbáltunk ki minden útirányt.
Nekem nagyon bejött. Különösen h gyönyörű a játék.
És külön zseniális a Kas mozgatásának a megoldása: a saját tábla (a bánya) közepét kiszed, helyette egy tök ugyanolyan alakú, de vékonyabb liftakna betét kerül oda, amiben a Kas vidáman megy le s fel, anélkül, h kisiklana belőle.

Közben persze figyelést is igényel, mert h kinek miből s mennyi (milyen s mennyi szén, milyen jármű, éés melyik járműn mennyi) teljesített rendelése van az nem mindegy, de az a teljesítés után már nem látszik, csak az aktuális műszak végi értékeléskor, igaz akkor jól meg lehet nézni és fel lehet készülni a többiekéből.

Én szerettem, nagyon.
Szerintem Asara szintű az összes kieggel, illetve a tavalyi Carrara a kieggel együtt kb.
Sokszor van a döntés kényszer h mit előbb, milyen ütembe, és legyen is elég, és haladjak, vagy gyűjtsek, vajon a másik erre megy, azt szerzi meg, vagy ráérek és inkább azt, mert az kell mindenkinek....

Én megint látok esélyt rá, h ez a játék fel-fel fog tűnni listákon, logikus jól összeszedett, érthető szabály, gyönyörű, családbarát, de gémereknek is tökéletes.

En este juego es importante asegurarte los monopolios del tipo de transporte o del tipo de carbón que vas a extraer. Pero tampoco se puede descuidar las vagonetas que dejas vacías ni el desequilibrio del pozo minero.
Es un juego que engaña, ya que parece que no tiene mucha interacción entre jugadores. Mentira. El puteo que puede haber en la colocación de trabajadores es bestial. Y luego hay que estar muy atento a qué van los demás jugadores.
La elección inicial de los tres encargos puede ser definitoria.

RATING: 5
This game is about as straightforward a euro as you could expect. You use a set amount of action points each round to acquire coal mines+pieces of coal, acquire contracts to ship those pieces of coal, move the coal to those contracts, and finally take the ship coal action for VPs. 

The things you want to acquire cost money (which is very tight) and/or action points (which increase in cost). The only rather interesting part of the affair is that players can choose to take an action previously taken but must pay +1 action point. Consequently, a lot of times you can't afford to go after something because you lack the money or the action point cost is prohibitively high and you won't be able to do the other things you need to do. 

Scoring happens in three rounds and is cumulative, so the things you collected in round 1 will still score in round 3. Therein lies the ostensible fun of the game, trying to collect things that will score repeatedly well over the course of the game given the limitations. 

This is not a bad game other than it's perfectly mediocre. There's nothing to inspire much love or hate for it. It all hangs together as you would expect from designers of this pedigree, but lacks the spark of, say, Palaces of Carrara to inspire me to want to play again.

Spiele des Traditions-Tandems Kramer/Kiesling sind die geborene Mitte der Qualität: nie schlecht, aber auch nie wirklich überragend. Die Amplitude führt ein ruhiges Leben am Erfindertisch der verdienten Altherren. In diese mediokre Qualität lässt sich auch GLÜCK AUF einordnen. Die im verklärten Bergbau angesiedelte Spielidee könnte unverschämt simpler nicht sein: GLÜCK AUF ist ein Spiel für einfache Arbeiter, die hier hauptsächlich Kohle aus dem Stollen fördern und ihn auf Auftragskarten hieven, die Punkte bringen. Der Förderschacht ist dabei ein Gimmick nahe Yps, das Känguru. GLÜCK AUF erhebt keinerlei akademische Spieldesignansprüche und will nicht mehr sein, als es ist. In seiner Einfachheit ist es der Mentalität der kumpelhaften Zeche näher als z.B. die komplexe Ruhrkohle-Trilogie von Thomas Spitzer. Bei mir punktet GLÜCK AUF als subjektives Liebhaberspiel, das die Qualitätsamplitude jenseits der soliden, verlässlichen Durchschnittlichkeit von Kramer/Kiesling diesmal Richtung Herz ausschlagen lässt. Das Pappmaterial könnte besser sein, Steiger von Pegasus/eggert.

One of the highlights of my 2014.

The game has no radical innovation:
- The balancing of the mine is just a modified form of a Knizia scoring.
- The "get an occupied space by spending more" reminds me of Lancaster or, more recently, Bruxelles.
- The elevator mechanism is nothing more than a cost, cleverly implemented.

However, the mechanisms serve the theme wonderfully, the game runs smoothly and offers deep and complex choices, which combined with the interesting majority-scoring creates a very different experience.

It is not a breakthrough by any means, but it is a wonderfully neat and enjoyable game!

After 2 plays, I very much like this game. A high amount of fun for the duration, provided you like competitive worker placement and efficiency management.

The cardboard components in this game are amazingly BAD, everything warps to the point of being unusable.

Coal Baron uses Kramer and Kiesling's action point system and hides it behind a worker placement game. Because of this, it feels very fast and all players are interested in where "action workers" are placed. If the spot you want is full, you can still use that action at the cost of one additional worker. Fulfilling, this is wrapped in a set collection delivery game with quality and unique components. Very little to complain about, Coal Baron is enjoyable.

Old-school feel to this Euro game: worker placement, pick up and deliver, and action point allocation when working in the pit. It all flows very well and theme ties it together. Avoids a flashy gimmick like turning wheels, etc. (although the pit cage is fun to slide around!)

Nice worker placement game from the best duo in gaming (Kramer/Kiesling), where you have to plan carefully. There are enough things to do and to plan ahead to have an interesting game.

The theme is there and the game reminds me of the good old days that brought us Tikal and others.

(05/15/2014) Comment based on 1 play.

This is a light-medium weight, linear, worker placement, resource collection game, that blends elements of [thing=34635][/thing] and [thing=12477][/thing] with a unique coal mining theme.

At first glance, this does not feel anything like a Kiesling & Kramer design, although it has a very clean, Euro feel to it. Players are given a large number of workers, which they can place on the various action spaces on the board. Although only one player can occupy an action space with a worker, the novelty is that another player can occupy the same action space, albeit more expensively, needing to allocate two workers. The player after that must allocate three workers, and so forth. So, players are not locked out of action spaces as in other worker placement games, but must allocate more workers at a linear rate.

I suppose the allocation of a bunch of workers reminds me of Stone Age, but the processing of resources into VP is a five-step/action process, similar in feel to Bootleggers. The player must execute the following actions in this sequence: 1) Collect $X money (if they don't have enough), 2) Buy coal rail cars (which have X resources on them for $Y), 3) Select coal "contracts" (which gives you X VP for delivering Y resources), 4) Expend N-action points to harvest/transport/allocate coal onto the contracts, and 5) Select transportation mode (1 of 4) to deliver coal/contracts for VP. Rinse and repeat. The tension comes from selecting action spaces first, for the fewest allocation of workers, as well as grabbing the most abundant coal rail cars and most lucrative contracts. The another source of novelty is the coal "elevator" that allows players to harvest the coal resource cubes from the rail cars, onto the elevator, which is then transported to the surface, and then deposited to the various contracts. Each player has their own tableau, complete with their own elevator that moves up and down the shaft; the shaft connects the various tunnels that lead to the various coal rail cars that are purchased.

The only random elements are the order and type of contracts and the variety of the coal rail cars. The amount of coal collected is deterministic, where more money simply buys higher value coal rail cars. Players need to monitor each others' tableaus, predicting what action spaces are needed to complete and deliver contracts, and preempting those spaces first, so as to expend the fewest workers per action. This is an interesting twist to Kiesling & Kramer's classic "Action Point" mechanism, where each player is given a fixed number of APs, and a menu of possible actions, each with a different action point cost. However, this method does not allow any interaction, so it was sort of a multi-player solitaire, except for the gameboard state. Instead, they have done away with APs, giving everybody a bank of "worker points", so to speak, and forcing players to compete for action spaces and unique tiles/cards. If the space is important enough, a player need only expend more worker points than the previous player. However, they must budget their worker points wisely, since those points must be economically allocated to the various action spaces described above. Thus, this has plenty of interaction in terms of action spaces, but is multi-player solitaire as far as the players' tableaus are concerned.

The components are decent, and the rules seemed to be straightforward, with rules explanation only taking about 15 minutes.  There's very little downtime, since the players' actions are interwoven. There's a lot of play given that the game only takes about an hour. However, the actions are somewhat repetitive.

There are some interesting ideas here, but nothing ground-breaking. It seems like another borderline "just another soulless Euro", and I don't see much replay value. Every game will be about fighting over the action spaces, while the coal mining aspect is comparatively trivial and will become same-y after a number of games. I can see what Kiesling & Kramer were trying to do here, but compared to their classics, such as [thing=54][/thing], this is spatially uninteresting. It's a solid "7", but I can't see it going any higher.

My comment for this game is very similar to what I said about Nauticus -- this has the elegant rule set I associate with Kramer and Kiesling, but gameplay is a very dry optimization exercise.

2016-05-03 - I think I may have had this rated a little higher than it should have been. Still a really good game, but there's not quite enough tension, even with 4 players, for it to be truly great. The mechanisms still work really well, though, and the movement puzzle is awesome. I'm lowering it from an 8 to a 7.

2014-07-06 - This is a great, light-medium worker placement game from Kramer and Kiesling. Like other games of theirs (that I've played), the crux of this game is an efficiency puzzle. The theme isn't terribly interesting, but the game play is solid. The elevator is fun, and the interaction is light, but still interesting.

I liked this a little less than I expected. It is a worker placement where you bring different types of coal to your mine and then use this to fulfill orders. It has a nice mine cart that you can move up and down the mine. The game goes pretty quick and in some ways feels light except for the complicated scoring. Each of the three rounds adds more scoring options. The scoring seems like a burden for what can feel like a light game. I suppose in a way the complex scoring is what adds some depth. I would play it again, but am not adding it to my wishlist yet.

Worker placement to gain majorities in three scorings. The complexity is ok for advanced families, not enough for heavy gamers who don't enjoy lighter fare. Except for the three intermediate majority scorings, the game's theme is well integrated and its fun to play with the cool mining elevator.
The worker placement is only a mean to an end. As in any majority game, the key is to win where you invest heavily and to make easy second places with low invest. One of the better outings in this genre which isn't among my favourites. Two of my co-players found it a bit too calculational although I don't share this impression.

This is simply a fun game.  It's worker placement, but it seems more appropriate to call it "time spent" placement or maybe "human resources" placement.
Don't let the dry sounding theme turn you away.  You could just as easily be producing butter scotch candies for your chain of candy stores.  (Probably a bad example) 
Turns should be relatively quick, but your decisions are very meaningful in the results.  There is definite player interaction when you make an action more expensive or less productive for your opponents by beating them to the action they need.

Mediocre worker placement game. Don't really understand the love this game gets. Yes, it's short. So are many other games.

Some components aren't really good. For example, the tiles and shaft inlay really could've used some extra thickness.

Worker placement game where you can go in the same spot as another player but you just have to pay 1 worker more (similar to the worker mechanism in Keyflower). Each round goes until everyone uses up all their workers so trying to make the most of your worker pool is key. The turns are snappy and the pace of the game is quite quick. The scoring that ramps up over the course of the 3 rounds is an interesting race to hold the majority in the three scoring categories.

Kellemes hangulatú munkáslehelyezős játék a könnyedebb fajtából. A tematika és a mechanika összefonódása átlagos szintű, teljesen rendben van. Az interakció alapvetően a szokásos, bár itt nem foglalnak le egy helyet teljesen előled, csak nehezebb használni, mert +1 munkás kell a lent lévőkhöz képest. Ez mindenféleképpen érdekes megoldás. A további interakciót az adja, hogy figyelni kell a többieket mit tevékenykednek, ugyanis 3 pontozós forduló van, és mindig a többségeket kell figyelni. A körítés (szénbányászat) érdekes, a liftezős megoldás kimondottan tetszik (mondjuk ha úgy vesszük szokásos pick  up and deliver akciópontból), szóval remekül összerakott játék a családi kategória környékén (felső határán?).

[b]Coal Baron[/b] - Its classical worker placement game, where at the end most points wins. 

There is one main board with different actions and once player put his worker (every player starts with n workers, depending on the player count) on some action, same player or other can use the same action by putting one more worker on it. [i]So you can't block other players directly[/i]. 

Every player is owner of its own mine. 

What you are trying to do is really straight forward. Most of the stuff is on the main board. Take contracts (which you try to fulfill), get money from the bank (you don't sell anything in this game, but rather try to take the spot on game board that gives you money), buy tunnel tiles with lorries and put them in your mine with coal cubes on them, than use actions to get the coal from your pit onto those contracts and at the end you deliver those contracts based on the type of the vehicles on them, which gives you points. 

There are 3 shifts in the game and after every one there is scoring of those fulfilled contracts based on some majorities (by type of coal, or by which type of vehicle contract is delivered or number of empty lorries in your mine). 

In the nutshell: Get money, get contracts, take lorries and add them to the mine with coal, "mine" your coal (and put them onto contracts), deliver contracts, get points.

While reading the rules, I was surprised how light this game really is. I was reminded of Stone Age, because the order cards (which give you points if you put just the right types of cubes on them) are very similar to the huts in Stone Age, so let's compare it to that. In Gluck auf there are only five things you do, and you practically have to do them in the right order: get money, buy lorries with coal cubes with that money, use the mining action to transfer the coal cubes from the lorries to your order card (this is the fun part where you move the cabin up and down to load and unload cubes), deliver the order cards, get new order cards. After each of the three rounds you score points for having majorities in a certain colour of cube or a certain type of order cards (distinguished by the means of transport - train, horse etc - that part of the theme is really pasted on badly). There is no engine building, there's just this progression of money > cubes > order cards, and that is the problem with this game. In Stone Age with its simpler rules you still have to choose between investing in current output and  future capability (with the love hut / tool cabin / field actions); in Gluck Auf you're just always grinding the wheels that will get you points. The strategy is supposed to come from aiming for certain majorities, but tracking what colours of cubes and types of transport other players are scoring is not much fun. Still a mechanically sound game with beautiful components though.

It’s a worker placement game from master designers Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling. Have they ever designed any worker placement games? Oh yes, they did, that was Asara, and that is my only problem with this game –although it’s not obvious at first sight, this is about 60% the same game as Asara (even though it’s a bit more complex and it even incorporates some action point allowance like the games in their famous Mask trilogy). Glück Auf is a game about mining and it features a worker placement mechanism that might have seemed a novel idea when they started to develop the game but after games like Lancaster, Vanuatu and Keyflower it isn’t very new anymore: in order to use an action space that someone else has already used, you have to kick them from there – with more workers than what they have there. Otherwise it’s a pretty standard worker placement where you collect tiles, deliver cubes, go to bank etc. It works fine but it just didn’t feel very new. Quite interestingly, while it’s a game from this strong designer duo, the saving grace of the game is the components and especially the graphic/production design which is detailed, clear but still captures the theme perfectly.

You must be the most affluent Coal Baron at games end to win.  Coal Baron is a wonderfully composed worker placement game.  The mechanics are very tight, and the managing aspects of materials to market are well done.  Coal Baron can be played in under an hour with 4 players.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of worker placement.

Played once, 4p.  Quite good, though nothing we haven't seen before.  Pretty standard set collection, multiple scoring option game.  The mechanism I liked in particular, though, was that you were rarely totally locked out of an option... if it was worth enough to you.  This set up plenty of push your luck options.

I was really excited by a new Kramer game, but this is a let down.  The game is mechanically sound but so simple there's barely anything to think about.  It plays fine, the components are a bit flimsy, the theme is reasonably well integrated.  A group able to play this could play Asara, Alhambra or a number of other games to better effect.  I would say pass.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This made a solid first impression for most of us.  Found the worker placement mechanism really interesting as everyone has 18 workers for each of the three rounds and must place one more worker than the previous player to go in an action space.  Money is tight.  

Be sure to value coal and transportation in correct ratios.  Don't over pursue a majority - doing so will cost you points earning second in other areas.  

The scoring mechanism was interesting - not the majority scoring aspect, but the fact that there are three different scorings and some aspects score 1,2 or 3 times.  

I did find the quality of the cardboard in the R&R version very low as it is very thin and tends towards warping.

A great worker-placement game that is not difficult to learn but has some layers to it that add depth of strategy.  I finished dead last the only time I played this (out of 3 people) but still had a good time.  I think the theme and everything works extremely well here, from the quality of coal you're mining to the method of transportation you use to get it to market, it all comes together very nicely.

If you like multiple layers of set collection without much thematic justification that is tied with worker placement and a small amount of pick up and deliver you will like Coal Baron. However, if you're like me and you are not a fan of set collection for nothing but the sake of creating different scoring objectives Coal Baron is your run of the mill worker placement to fulfill orders, just like Lords of Waterdeep or Stone Age, despite being soli mechanically. Sure it has its pick up and deliver aspect too, but I prefer LoW's intrigue cards, plot quests, and buildings, and slightly prefer Stone Age's food mechanism and card powers.

I also am not a fan of the theme, but not to the point that I lowered the rating in this case (it went from about a 5.3 to a 4.7 due to the theme).

Die Spieler fahren mit Aufzügen in ihren jeweiligen Schacht ein, um die in vier Etagen produzierte Kohle nach oben ans Tageslicht zu bringen und schließlich abzutransportieren. Je tiefer die Kohle liegt, desto teurer ist deren Abbau. Die geförderte Kohle wird auf Aufträge verteilt, die man sich besorgen muss und für die man, je nach Umfang und Art der Kohle, Siegpunkte erhält. Dazu braucht es am Schluss aber noch ein geeignetes Transportmittel.
Man setzt Arbeiter ein, die einem Aufträge, Transportmittel, Aktionspunkte oder Tunnelplättchen liefern. Für die Tunnelplättchen braucht’s Geld, was man gleichermaßen mit Arbeitereinsatz erhält. Immer wenn alle ihre Arbeiter eingesetzt haben, endet eine Schicht, an deren Ende es jeweils eine Wertung gibt.

(Too?) Simple action point driven game, wonderfully themed.

Shipping your order on the right time is crucial. Interesting gameplay. More plays needed. I have a feeling that it may be overly balanced. You always score in some category. Of course you need to score in the best categories.

Playtime was 1,5 hours, for 3 players. That felt a bit too long for what the game really is. But maybe there is more to discover. To be continued.

The system where you can push workers off a space (meaning that unlike most worker placement games it is less likely that you will be locked out of an essential space) and the micromanagement of getting coal out of you mine (almost a mini game within the game) sets it apart from other worker placement games I've played recently. Kramer and Kiesling have still got it!

Schönes Workerplacement Spiel mit einem stimmig umgesetzten Thema. Da durch den Einsatz zusätzlicher Arbeiter auch bereits belegte Felder noch genutzt werden können, ist es besser möglich auf die Mitspieler zu reagieren und ggf. auftretende "Planungsfehler" wieder zu korrigieren. Dadurch wirkt das Spiel deutlich verzeihlicher und weniger frustrierend als manch anderes Workerplacement-Spiel. 
Das Material ist ordentlich und die Spielmechanismen funktionieren prima. Gutes bis sehr gutes Spieltiefe zu Spielzeit Verhältnis.

Kramer & Kiesling have long been one of my favorite development teams. Here they don't disappoint. Coal Baron is a midweight game that can play within an hour. It mixes a number of popular mechanics with worker placement taking the forefront. Basically, you purchase the rights to mining contracts (with various delivery systems) and rights to open new shafts within your mine. You use action points to move your mine cart/elevator to gather and deliver the raw materials needed to fulfill your contracts.

I like how the worker placement spaces do not block other players. If a place is taken you can still go there by playing down one more worker than already exists on that spot. The efficiency of your worker placements and timing is key here.

Well nothing new. The elevator is only somehow an Action point tracker. Reminded me a lot of Asara. But Asara is much cleaner. Hope I´ll have a chance to play Magnum Sal in the near future to compare those two. The most important rule is at the end of the rules, what happens if a colour runs out, which is the key to play it more strategic

Simple combination of worker placement and that signature Kramer and Kiesling action point system. It's elegant. It's tight and loose at the same time (or perhaps alternating times). Or perhaps it only feels loose at times, when it's really always tight. But it plays fast, teaches fast, and is just plain fun. Lot of game in this box.

A solid worker placement game. I really like how the action point allowance system works here with the mine shaft, which is a mechanic I don't normally enjoy that much. At the same time, it makes me take the recipe-fulfillment mechanism of games like Lords of Waterdeep for granted. Here you have to do multiple actions over multiple turns just to turn in a couple things of coal. I enjoyed this game, but it doesn't really stand out from the pack for me. It's also a little long for what it is with more players. Works really well as a next step game after Lords of Waterdeep or Stone Age though.

Can a game be more Euro than this? The worker you place are just that: workers in a cola mine. There are many actions you can take but not at the same time and the longer you wait (i.e. the more other players that take them before you), the higher the cost. In this context, you need to acquire money, contracts and wagons, move the elevator up and down to bring coal out of the mine and put them on vehicles for delivery. All actions and costs are so clearly marked on the board that the game more or less plays itself. The only objection I have is that it may be a bit too tactical - rather than a long-term strategy, you optimize each turn by checking which actions you need and which of them that other players may want to take.

RATING: 7
[b]Length: 5/5 [/b]: This game is really quick at all player counts and the analysis paralysis is really limited because you are able to take most every action when you want, it's somewhat clear what actions need to be taken in regards to your order cards, blocking isn't quite as devastating in this game as it is in other worker placements because you are able to take an action as long as you can place one additional worker than the amount that were already on the space. Because many people will be using similar spaces, workers will run out somewhat quickly, and there are only three rounds of the game. It really is over quickly.

[b]Components: 3/5 [/b] I love the tunnel, I love the elevator, the coal and workers are pretty easy to handle. But there are a few reasons why the components are just pretty average otherwise.

The board's art isn't bad, but it's not special. This also applies with the art on the mine tiles, order cards, money, box... basically everything. The mine tiles are a pain to shuffle because of how many there are and how many times you have to draw more out. The money is paper, *the ultimate sin*. To be completely honest, it really is fitting to the theme. But it's tough to handle, and isn't very sturdy, just like all paper money. It's just the way it is.

[b]Strategy: 4/5[/b]: Pretty good. You have to think long term and short term, and doing those things simultaneously can be pretty difficult. I have played heavier games and had an easier time coming up with a legitimate plan. Having to constantly decide whether you'll get more points from delivering an order with more victory points on it, or by delivering one with an additional train on it is an important decision. I'll be honest, I'm not actually very good at this game because of this short term/long term disconnect. But that doesn't make it bad, it makes it unique, and very enjoyable.

Light eurogame that takes all the typical mechanisms of this genre, adds memory, and mixes them.

The graphic design, as dark as the coal mines it depicts, its nice. The components are so so, but given its more tan affordable retail price, wwe can't ask for more.

The theme is almost inexistant. It's an abstract game with a superficial theme and some unrelated scoring rules.

Up side:
-> Elegant: few rules, easy to learn, and no need for manual during gameplay.
-> Fast play.
-> Balanced.

Down side:
-> It features my 2 most hated mechanics: majorities and memory.
-> Too many points are assigned by the majorities, and they are way too difficult (if not impossible) to control; you might pursue and win some, but your biggest rival might win more points with 2nd places...

It is a good game, but not for me. I would still like to play it from time to time.

First we have a lot of really good worker placement games and second the component quality is awful.

A very elegant worker placement affair. Not the world's most exciting theme, extracting different types of coal from your mine to fulfil orders for coal, but once you're into the game, it feels right. Available actions are to get money, which is used to dig tunnels to auto-find coal in your mine, obtain order cards, shift the coal from your mine to the order cards, and then transport the order cards to score them. One thing I really liked was that no action was ever shut off ... you can always pay one more worker than what was paid last time, just making it costlier. Because you have lots of workers, there's little races amongst these actions to get the stuff you most want to do as efficiently as you can. Scoring is your usual point salad which gets added to with each round so scoring escalates ... most coal dug out in each colour, most coal transported in each colour, most coal transported by each means of transport (there are 4). On the downside, each round is much the same as the first, meaning you're going to play the same game three times, and this shifts the rating downwards. It does allow each player to assess where they are in terms of each scoring category vis a vis the other players and what they need to do next round to sneak a win in their targeted category, so the "same game" problem isn't as prevalent as it is in Francis Drake say. Rules are easy to teach, everything's straightforward and meshes together nicely. You want to do most actions each turn, but while there's some race tension in most places (especially the "shifting coal out" spots as everyone must go there, whereas not everyone will be going for the same tunnel spots or order spots), you know you can always do what you must. It's a nice easy-level worker placement game that you could play with non-gamers (but it's by no means a gateway game) with the downside of having a non-attractive theme, so it probably won't always work too well in that respect. Just not sure whether subsequent games are going to feel too same-y, given each game means you've effectively played it three times, each round being the same feel as the prior. Probably.

Holy Coal Cube-Pushing Up a Mine Chute, Batman! Yup! Worker placement, set collection, majority scoring, pickup and deliver, tile laying, action point allowance system, Kramer and Kiesling game with coal mining theme! Good gameplay. Takes less than 90 minutes. Theme really works well with the mechanisms. This is my favorite typical Kramer and Kiesling.

This is one of the EuropeMasters 2014 games. Unfortunately you usually get fed up with theese games after practise for the competition, but this I got fed up with already before that. I bought my copy, first English edition at Spiel '13. Unfortunately, since that version have very poor quality components. all tiles are too thin and thus bend. 

Gameplay is quite straight forward and gets boring after only a few plays. Usually it's too rewarding transporting black coal since it gives you top scores in two of three categories.

An interesting aspect due to scoring rules is that there is little gain in trying to be the only leader in scoring each category. make sure you tie the top in as many categories as possible.

My favorite worker placement game!  I like the theme, I like the look of the board and components, I REALLY enjoy the moving coal car and how you have to count your movements carefully.  I like how you can always pick an action that someone has already done that round; you just have to pay "one more" for taking the action.  And I love tiles.  And the scoring systems keep you wondering if you're making the best decisions.  Absolutely great game!!!

One of the better worker placement games out there.  The fact that players can drive up the "cost" for action spaces is a nice twist to the mechanism.  Play is quick, though occasionally slows a bit when a player has to optimize the actions of their mining shaft.  The overall length of the game is perfect for what the game offers.

Coal Baron is definitely too involved to be called a filler, but moves along very well for a game of its depth.  You're using worker placement to buy mine shafts, obtain contracts requiring certain combinations of cubes, and transport the cubes out of the mine shafts and deliver them to the contracts.  Points are awarded depending on how well you've done with your completed contracts compared to others; the number of things you're scored on increases each round, which provides a nice ramp-up in scoring.  Overall, I thought this game was solid and provided a nice fulfillment optimization feel in a short play time.

(01/18) Have a lot of feelings about this game, it was my gateway, I'd played a couple of little fun party games, but this one was the one. I got home and inmediately ordered it. I just wanted to play again and get the most of its dynamic.

It is a really elegant worker placement, contract delivering euro/worker placement game that has really nice mechanics and different things to react to, there's coal, a mine, forms of transportation and it even has great interaction in the form of # of workers I need to use if a place has been taken already. A friend was playing it and as he was low on money and needed some to do something else said "this game is a lot like life". It was fun.

It is a great game that I'd play anytime. Pretty thematic and thinky without being heavy.

I played this a lo before I started logging games, I think I played it 8 times before the ones appearing here.

I got to try this game at my local meetup and I had fun playing it. The rule is simple enough to teach in 10 minutes and the game is engaging but not too overwhelming. I had the most fun with this game since I could grasp medium light games better than medium heavy games. 

The game plays fast and the action allowance system is not too AP inducing. The theme is a bit thin but it doesn't bother me. Would love to play again. It gave me an Alhambra on steroids feel because you have to remember who is keeping what majority instead of knowing it at all times.

Quick and interesting resource efficiency/worker placement game where you farm coal of different qualities from different depths in your mine and move them up to the surface in your elevator. Workers are placed on a central board to execute actions at different levels of effectiveness where the cost of taking the action is 1+ the number of workers already standing on the spot. It's really fun to see how far you can push things to complete all your contracts and still keep a balanced mine.

An overly dry and spreadsheety euro. The gameplay does present a moderately complex efficiency puzzle, but it feels very abstract and there's nothing special in either the mechanics or theme to engage with. There's a bit of a thematic connection, but it's weak and the theme is rather unexciting to start with. The worker placement gameplay feels pretty standard with nothing to really recommend it. In particular, I see no reason to play this game when worker placement games like Viticulture exist, with better gameplay, theme, and aesthetics.

RATING: N/A
A bit dry, but not awful. It's a Kramer/Kiesling production so everything is really smooth and works well. It's not just straight worker placement since you can add workers to spaces to either a.) take something that someone has already claimed, or b.) deliberately raise the cost for others. It's some good sequencing and prioritizing as well -- the pool of workers have to be managed and portioned out appropriately to claim actions (without overpaying) and then you have to use a kind of in-game Action Point Allowance to get your coal out of the ground efficiently. 

It's a weird duck, though, in that it's not light enough for a Family Game and I'm not sure it's deep or mean enough for a gamer's game. But overall, it's not bad. Won't stand up to dozens of plays a year, but it's a simple, straightforward game that's certainly worth a couple plays if you're into this kind of thing.

I absolutely love this game. I think it's great for people of most ages, because it's a somewhat simple game as far as rules are concerned, but there is still a lot of depth in trying to maximize the amount of points you obtain. Your strategy has to evolve somewhat around end game scoring, so even from the start you have an idea of what you need to do.

Most of the opponents hand is in the open, so there are a lot of points, especially near the end of the game, where I'm observing my opponent's board in order to think about what end game scoring I can beat him or her at, and that's what the last shift of the game usually is for me.

This game is very back and fourth. If you aren't careful, your 30 point lead could end up being overrun by someone who happened to have a better end game score than you. I know I keep talking about the end game scoring but it really is a major part of this game and it makes a game that would otherwise just be pretty good into a game that is absolutely amazing. 

As far as the negative points go, the paper money is a hassle. It can be irritating to try and stack or hand out paper money because it tends to get stuck together. Also, since it's paper, it doesn't have the same longevity as cardboard or metal money, so I'd suggest getting something to replace it.

Overall I'd highly suggest this game. It's simple enough for new gamers, but strategic enough for experienced gamers.

RATING: 7
I'm not a fan of pick-up and deliver, and this game takes that concept pretty literally, but Kramer and Kiesling have a knack for making enjoyable games. This one is pretty straight forward in its execution, but there's charm in the way everything is laid out. Players enjoy sliding the elevator up and down to load goods from the mine carts. Racing other players to the actions you need, so you can save your workers and thus get more actions, is where the meat of the game hides. It feels like a lot of other games, but I could see myself adding this to my collection some day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After one play: I didn't enjoy this as much as I expected to, given that these designers are among my very favorites. Much of the scoring relies on hidden-but-trackable information, so either you develop a good memory or you are in the dark about how best to plan for a significant part of your score. (Of course, you could easily house-rule that there is no hidden information; but then—as is often the case in Kramer-Keisling games—that could cause significant "analysis paralysis".)

That said, it's still an interesting game with lots to think about and some tough choices.

Another well designed modern Euro with nice art and good components. The main mechanism is worker placement (with the twist of "outbidding" with more workers to use a field twice) and scoring is for different majorities (type of coals delivered, means of transportation, mined coals). To me most mechanisms feeled pasted on and I disliked the majority scoring. To play this effectively, you would need to remember what majorities your opponents had in the last scoring. The coal elevator is a nice gimmick though.

We really like the simplicity of the rules and yet the fact that the game is not simple. Super quick to learn and play it's a very rewarding hour, especially with a full compliment of players.

Turns fly by and you're constantly adjusting your plans based upon what other players are doing. All the while you're keeping your eye on your main plan. You've got a set number of workers to play on each of the three turns and you're trying to make them stretch just that much more than your opponents whilst you do well in the majority battles you choose to fight out. You can't win them all and so it's about judging which ones you can win (or come in second) cheaply. Not much of a coal mining theme, but the overall presentation is nice anyway. The paper money is appalling bad.

A rewarding light game that doesn't overstay its welcome.

This was another relatively new game at LT17 that I was not going to go out of my way to play.  I'm really glad I did.  There isn't a whole lot of innovation going on here, but it does one of my least favorite elements (area control) in an interesting way.  The worker-placement element is really well done in how you have progressive bids to do the actions.  Money is tight and tightness is something I really like.  I also enjoyed how the scoring works as well.  Plus, it plays pretty quick with limited downtime.  Good stuff.

Könnyed munkáslehelyezős játék kevés újdonsággal. A játékosok saját bányáikat menedzselik, amikbe csilléket vehetnek 3 fajta szenet termelni. Szerződéseket szerezhetnek, amik teljesítéséhez adott számú és fajtájú szénre van szükségük, illetve a végén egy emberükkel az adott fajtájú járművet kell igénybe venniük a táblán. A tárnák bővítése a csillékkel pénzbe kerül, a pénz megszerzése szimpla hely a táblán, nagyon egyszerű megoldás. A játék érdekességét talán a tárnákban való mozgás adja. Ez sima mozgáspont igénybevételével mehet. A 4 szintre lifttel lehet lejutni és egy-egy mozgáspont minden széndarab bepakolás és kivétel és egy-egy liftmozgás. 3 körös játékban még a pontozás ad kis érdekességet. Mindegyik körben 4-el több dolgot pontozunk. Ez egy jó ötletes megoldás, de valahogy szerintem magában hordozza a runaway leader problémát. A játék gyors, egyszerű, könnyen tanítható. Ezek mindenképp előnyei, de nem ájultam el tőle, talán kicsit nekem túl egyszerű volt.

After third game with the girls and Orly:
- As it does not require any reading - all is just colors, tiles and cards with images - Its very approachable for the entire family.
- The game is much better with 4 players than 3.
- Fun, lots of interaction and planning.
- Orly: "I need another game to beat all of you".

After second game (with the girls):
- Better, lots of interaction. Useful game for practicing planning in advance and tradeoff.
- However the scoring at the end makes the end result somewhat unexpected.

After first game:
- Feels like working in a coal mine. You have to compute too much all the time.

1 play, prototype: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/155947/item/2612869#item2612869

1 play, published: I decided to concentrate on the deepest darkest coal types, the most expensive/lucrative transport (trains), and generally high-value contracts. And it worked! I made money in part 1, didn't deliver anything in part 2 (collecting stuff instead), then made good in part 3. Maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much more this time around? Who knows? This time around, though, it was quite enjoyable: quick, but meaty. Still not a lot of fresh mechanisms, but a nice meshing of old faves like majorities, worker placement/action selection, set collection, pick-up-and-deliver ... good stuff!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players each have a personal mine shaft, complete with a working elevator in the center! Also take some money and a bunch of workers, and choose some contracts (reverse turn order?) from an initial display.  The board shows several action spaces where you can take additional cash or transportation cards (cart, buggy, truck, train), acquire more contracts or several types of mines (4 colors of coal, found at different depths; place in your mine immediately), movement points (spent moving your elevator up and down, loading/unloading coal), complete contracts, etc. 

On your turn, take an action by placing workers in a space -- one more than are already present there (except for one space, where you can always place a worker to get $1) -- those get displaced to a waiting area until the end of the turn. 

After every third of the game (4 turns), top 2 players get VP for each of several things: first for each of the 4 types of coal delivered, then for that plus the most delivered with each transport mode, then for those plus the most empty wheelbarrows in each type of mine. 

At game end, there is additional scoring for leftover money and cubes, and penalties for unfulfilled contracts and imbalanced mines (left/right side of elevator). Most VP wins.

Very euro game and with a nice and smooth mechanic that allow players to understand the rules in a couple of minutes.

It has some density when making decisions but the secret to enjoy the game is to think about where aren't the others playing at a certain moment and how can I fill those blanks.
Like in every worker placement game this one too has the 'fill in the blanks' feeling but with an economic structure behind. 

Two main things I want to underline in Coal Baron: The elevator. It's so cool the elevator! And the smoothness of play. Extremely elegant is the best way to put things.

I would risk to say that this is a 4 player game. Not less.

Light/Medium game
So much fun, so smooth and elegantly designed by one of my favourite partnership designers (Kiesling & Kramer).
 
You actually feel like you're mining coal and moving them up the ingenious and "fun to tinker with" mining shaft - each player gets an elevator that slides up and down the elevator shaft!

You feel like you're accomplishing things when you "fill orders" and then have to ship them out. Each of the above actions including obtaining money requires worker placement.

The twist on worker placement for this game is that you may reuse a spot already taken but you must use 1+ additional number of workers than the previous player used on that spot. This means you can't directly be blocked from a spot, however it will get cost incrementally more for you to use a particular spot repeatedly.

Scoring happens over 3 rounds and items that scored for you in the past are re-evaluated and cumulatively scored again. In round 1 one category is scored. In round 2 the category that was scored last round is checked for majorities, scored again, and then a second new category is scored.  The third round the 1st and 2nd categories are scored and then a 3rd is added. It's important that score well early on because it's all cumulative.  Being  well rounded and always watching to score high in as many majorities as you can also helps.

Rated high for the level of depth that this games falls into which is between Light/Medium weight.  Packs a lot for about an hour of play time (approx. 15 min/ player)!

RATING: 8
An excellent mix of theme and euro mechanics. A worker placement/action selection game where you are placing time that cost more if other time units are already in the space. There is always a good place to go to do what you want but timing and the cost is what really makes the game.

Other than scoring phase, the actions and path to victory is easily understood by the players thanks to the theme. This makes the game work great for teaching to new players. While the way the end round scoring can take one game to grock; the way it grows in complexity allows new players to learn it as it goes in that first game. The end game penalty for not completing orders is important but not debilitating. again, good for new players.

This game has great components but is known to commonly have slightly warped boards for the mine shafts and rooms. My version dose have this warping issue.

-------------------------------------------------------

We do use a house rule for the beginning selection of orders. We use a snake draft going last player to first then first to last. This feels like it makes for a more balanced starting setup.

I have recently heard of another house rule I want to try with experienced players where the penalty for unfinished orders are the value of the order.

Solid, straightforward worker placement game. Board spaces provide money, mine tiles (added to player mine boards with coal cubes), order cards (a type of transport shipping a combination of coal colours for points), 4-10 mine action points (one to move the elevator, one to move a coal cube from a mine to the elevator, one to move elevator to an order card), and transport (get points for filled order cards of the space's type).

It's got a nice rhythm to it and enough going on to defy trivial optimization. It's just not particularly interesting -- polished, but absolutely nothing we haven't seen before.

Coal Baron's main problem is that it's a little unspectacular. It feels a lot like Asara in that it is a light/medium-light Euro where a little efficiency goes a long way, there's no engine building to speak of and what you've achieved is scored each round.

It's a shame that we've seen all of these things, not only before, but from the same design team and as such Coal Baron feels perhaps a little less than the sum of its parts.

That's not to say I don't enjoy it; I do but it feels a little gentle and samey. I don't know that, longterm, I'll have room for both Asara and Coal Baron in my collection.

Pull four types of coal out of your mine and ship them four ways. All phases, you get a few points for loads of each color of coal. Phases 2 and 3, you get points for how you ship. Last phase, you get points for areas of your mine empties. Unfilled contracts and an unbalanced mine count against you.

I still like this. It's a little lucky, but mostly the luck can be mitigated by alternative plays.

Despite some of its unique elements and the famous 'action point system' indicative of other Kramer and Kiesling games, it does have the feel of a generic worker placement game. But this is not necessarily a weakness; the heart of the game for me is the strong element of timing, and deciding not only which actions you need, and which you need first, but which ones you think your opponents need. Trying to plan ahead and take actions in the right order adds a depth of strategy, tension and fun.

As you might expect from the veteran design team of Kramer/Kiesling, Coal Baron is a clean, crisp worker-placement game that flows very smoothly. That said, there's not as much decision angst here as there might be, but certainly you do feel the urgency to get your contracts completed before each round ends and scoring occurs. My only real complaint with the game is that, by the end of the game, there are 12 different majorities (both first and second place) being scored, and unless you want to expend a lot of brainpower memorizing every coal contract delivered by every player, it's tough to know exactly where you stand in each category. Nevertheless, Coal Baron is a well-polished offering that's likely to have a place on my game shelf for some time to come.

I consider this a good gateway game; maybe slightly on the deeper end of gateways, but still just easy enough that new gamers can handle it. I like the way scoring works. It adds a solid twist to planning well. I also like counting out my movement points with my elevator. Getting exactly what I need to make the deliveries I planned for is very satisfying. And coming up just short is grueling--in a good way.

Coal Baron is a worker placement game about running a coal mine. There's a bit of wonkiness to the theme. Coal comes in four colors yellow, brown gray and black. And you only get coal into your mine when you buy a coal cart, which can never be reused... and the different types of coal require different coal carts. But the theme is basically just a thin veneer over your standard optimization Euro game. If you're not down for that, then this isn't the game for you.

There are five basic types of worker spots in the game: Get money, get coal, get contracts, move your coal out of your mine onto transport, and deliver the contract. There are multiple spots but some are more desirable than others. You can always play on any spot by spending one more worker than the previous player in that spot. You keep going until everyone has spent all their workers and then you score points. Repeat three times... game over.

What I really liked about this game was the scoring mechanism. So delivering contracts gives you points... but there are also communal goals that everyone is trying to accomplish and they're based off what contracts you've delivered and how you've upgraded your mine. There are three sets of goals. The first set score at the end of every round. The second set score on round two and three. And the last set only score in the third round. The earlier goals don't score as many points, but they score more often. The communal goals reward whoever does best at that goal and generally about half as many points for second place.

Competing for the communal goals is really what makes for an interesting game. You need to take into account not only the points for the contract itself, but how it places you in terms of the communal goals. And just because you were best at some goal in the last round doesn't mean you will be next time. It's the sum total of everything you've done in the game to date, so you don't lose what you've already contributed to a goal, but other people can wrest that category away from you if they do more. It's a game where you need to be keeping an eye out for what other people are doing, remembering what they've done before, and evaluating the ever changing situation. This is a game about evaluation and making the most efficient placements and getting the best return for what you're doing. If you're not into Euros for Euros sake, then you won't enjoy this. If you are, this is a pretty neat little game.

[thing=143515][/thing] is a work placement game, and is filled with good ideas: the mechanics for placement and the varied effects of spots, specially the lift and the possibility of using a space already occupied by paying more workers, used to the gather resources, work very well, provinding opportunities, indirect interaction (non agressive; mainly blocking or raising costs), and different strategies.

Even when allowing for several paths to victory and a good amount of decisions, the pacing of the gameplay is agile: each player only makes one action at a time, and the play itself last for a quite intense three rounds - the room for mistakes and delays is narrow, and there isn't catch up mechanism to help someone that lag behind. [thing=143515][/thing] isn't a punitive game, but won't help you get out of a hole.

Overall, [thing=143515][/thing] is nicely efficient, providing space for different strategies to take place, interaction in the right dose, fast turns making for a speedy play, and little room for blunders - not all plans will work and adjustments must be made quickly. [thing=143515][/thing] has inteligent and effective mechanisms, and goes well recommended.

From the famed duo of Kramer and Kiesling comes Coal Baron, a game of mining, shipping and selling coal in 19th century Germany. This game definitely plays like a classic design from these two old-timers, which means it is a solid, standard Euro. It also distinctly feels like I have been here before. Granted, I already own the top 10 games from K&K, so this comes as no surprise.  The worker replacement mechanism in Coal Baron has been around, most recently in Automania. What is relatively fresh is the scoring track at the end of each shift. Players score specific categories for fulfilled orders, mode of transportation and types of minecarts. However, the  progressive expanded scoring allows certain categories to be scored multiple times over three rounds. Thus, fulfilled orders score three times while types of minecarts will score only once at the end of the game.

There are two modes of scoring for Coal Baron:  Short term, immediate scoring comes from fulfilling orders while long term planning comes from end of round scoring. There is a constant push and pull to quickly fulfill orders to compete for end of round scoring versus hoarding orders that require the same mode of transportation such that you can then deliver these orders in one shot. This makes for quite a compelling decision-making angst during game play.

Like Knizia, I appreciate K&K designed games for the simplicity, taut decision making and low-rules overhead. The game is short with 4 players clocking in at under an hour. While I may have some misgivings about the lack of novelty for a K&K design in Coal Baron, this is certainly more my fault as a veteran gamer rather than anything inherently wrong with the design of Coal Baron.

I'm always surprised when I see discussions on worker placement games and rarely see this one mentioned.  We own quite a few WP games now and this is easily our favorite and most-played.  The theme is great, the mechanics are really interesting, and it has more depth than a basic entry-level WP.  At the same time, we were able to teach it to players that are lighter gamers and they picked it up pretty easily and ended up with competitive scores.  It plays very well at both 2P and 4P.

Pros:
+ Fun theme
+ Buying mine cars and using the elevator add interesting dimensions
+ Scoring is unique and helps balance - a bit of point salad
+ Nice artwork, board is easy to navigate
+ Solid mid-weight - heavier than LoW but not quite up there with Agricola

Cons:
- Paper money...who does that?!  We pull out coins from another game to use with this one.  You could also just use some pennies and nickels.
- Was hard to find when we were looking for it, but it seems to be more readily available now

There's nothing really wrong with the game, but there's nothing terribly exciting about it, either.  The worker placement aspect of the game is OK, but it doesn't create a scarcity of actions so much as it makes future actions more expensive for those taking said actions.  The game feels more like a huge puzzle of taking this, then that, then this over here, and then making sure that you get this before everyone else, etc., than a game where you're interacting.  Don't get me wrong; you can interact pretty heavily, but it feels kind of artificial in the way that it all comes together.  Plus, there's the issue of the cards and carts being replaced randomly, so you can take something that's only marginally beneficial to you, only to see what would have been most beneficial to you following right after, only to see it scooped up by the next player just because he happened to be there.  It's just another "plan your efficiency" sort of game that leaves me cold.

it works very well, it's a very clean game where every move is essential. it seems to be very unforgiving, one error and you are done. the mechanism that penalizes the ties during scorings is maybe a bit ecxessive.
The worst aspect is, probably, the lack of something truly original. A part from this, a very enjoyable game that i would play again.

Smooth, easy to learn game.  Scores sneak up on you, and some great balancing between immediate and end game scoring.

Too light weight for our group and the subject matter isn't compelling as a gateway game

Very easy to pick up and play. Simple worker placement idea, but you also have some pickup and deliver stuff going on. Adding carts to your mine shaft ends up requiring some good balancing, as you'll have to fulfill orders and watch endgame scoring conditions.

Perfectly enjoyable for what it is.

This is a very lovely worker placement game. With only 3 rounds, a lot of workers and no option to really be blocked out - this is a keeper! The theme is very solid too.

Decent worker placement game with a glued on theme.

I like everything about this game except for the scoring. The unique elevator mechanic works very well, and the ability to just place more workers to take an action that has already been used makes the game less cutthroat. Unfortunately! For scoring I'm just trying to efficiently get as many different colored cubes and delivery vehicles as possible, which I find really bland.

The theme doesn't really seem to exist.  I'm forced to deliver goods by horse and buggy, truck, and rail just to get diversification points at the end of the game, and I have to keep exactly half of my mine unlit in order to not be penalized...? The scoring in this game absolutely ruins the theme. I certainly don't feel like I'm mining coal.

Pick up and deliver, kinda, with worker placement. I like the challenge of scoring the right kinds of transportation at the right time.

Solid workerplacement game, gateway game all about mining coals and getting them shipped out.

Not the most exciting game ever. Action Points meets Worker Placement. There's some interest and tension in timing your actions to avoid being blocked by others while simultaneously getting in their way. It's a game where players with good memories can use that to their advantage, tracking who is winning which scoring categories and by how much. Presumably the memory element is there to speed the game up and stop players being quite so analytical.

Up and down goes the elevator.  Haspelknecht is heavier and some better brain burn but Coal Baron still has some fun whimsy.

I was not too attracted to the mining theme at first but the game surprised me! It is a much better game than what I expected. The game play is smooth as silk and I really enjoy it.

I love how you must use 1 additional worker when placing a worker on an area where there is already a worker. It makes for some tough decisions especially since the amount of workers available is always dwindling and there is just so much work to get done before the rounds end and everyone is scored.

The mechanics are rock solid. Great components and love the elevator that slides down the shaft. The only thing I don't like is the money. It's a terrible design and seems out of place compared to the other well designed components.

I was introduced to this at a London Family Games Day a couple of years ago. Going in to it, no one in the group had heard of it, but after playing it, it left the group with a pretty favorable impression.

I very much enjoy it as a light to mid-weight worker placement game with action points, pick-up and deliver, and tile placement. It very much is a family style game that plays quickly and isn't overly complicated, and I think that's what makes it great.

Unlike other worker placement games where after someone places their worker, that space can no longer be used, in Coal Baron, you're able to use spaces that your opponents have used previously (or yourself) but you're required to play an additional number of workers. This mechanic is just enough to make you second guess whether or not to waste one of your precious workers (ultimately limiting the number of things you can do in a round) while still allowing to make a calculated gamble and/or not being shut out from doing something if you really need to.

A very enjoyable game and one that I should really play more often. While "brain-burner" games are enjoyable, this game is truly, fun.

Hay quien lo compara con Stone age, personalmente no me parece una analogía deshacertada... aunque yo me prefiero este antes que el de hans Im gluck. 

A mi pareja le ha gustado y he comprobado que funciona bien a dos y a tres jugadores, se queda en mi colección.

La nota negativa es que viene con billetes... algo muy anacrónico, yo lo juego con monedas.

+ Phase cards.

I enjoy playing Coal Baron; I see it as a lightweight/middleweight game that is a well-priced worker placement game and I can use it to introduce people to worker placement games without complicated rules.  I would play this a lot more as its very interesting and a good game.

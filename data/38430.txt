EXCELLENT !!! Having helped participate in the testing I have played many time. It is a game I now play very much and appreciate the quality. I am also helping Marco doing some French translations so naturally I am biased towards this very original game ;-)

An incredibly gorgeous, self-published game.  I was AWED by the level of effort they put into the production.  Amazing!

The gameplay itself is okay.  Nothing to write home about.  Maybe the expansions (included) would spice up the game a little more.

Probably the best 'board' I own - a 3d wonder. Shame the game will probably never be expanded.  In many ways a very traditional game but looks amazing. Very pleased I got a copy when I did.

RATING: 4
production value great.

But the game would have benefited from a producer-edit. change the movement rules to "up to" and re-check some of the cards. Atleast one card had a faulty YOU instead of a ALL. The cards were too spesific too. I think that out of all the cards that we drew, only one actually affected in a negative way.

What a gorgeous game!  Looks even better in person than in the photos.  Excellent component and production quality.  The board has no folds.  The pieces fit well and the graphics are easy to interpret.  Play balance is tight, although there are periods in the game when the leader cannot be clearly identified.  Often comes down to the last turn's race for camp.  Holds everyone's interest and the strategies are quite variable.  This one's going to get a LOT of play.

A recent acquisition. Sad to know that the designer Marco Bing is missing in action. Wonder where he went but this game is still great as it is with the expansion Wollemi Pines, which is simple to include.

I like the 3D map, only drawback is that the map is fixed and not modular. We have yet to play the full game of collecting all 4 bags of gold from all 4 mountains. Will have to play more times to get a better sense but for now I am very pleased to have this.

RATING: 5
A multi-player abstract race game.  It's okay, but rather bland.  The shorter game (collecting treasure bags from 3 of the 4 corners of the board) feels too easy.  Perhaps it would help to reduce the number of helicopter and walkie-talkie that each player starts with when playing the short game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very pretty game - components, storage tray etc are a work of love, if only all games could look this good!

Saying that - what about actual game play, I'd rather play an ugly game (StarBase Jeff, I mean you) with great gameplay than a lovely game that is pretty dire ...

Timber Tom isn't dire - but it isn't great either. A race game with a fair degree of stop the leader and a large dose of luck with the card. If it was fast enough to be a filler (under an hour) then I'd probably like it, but it isn't.  Probably a game my kids would enjoy, but at the price I can't justify getting it - plenty of other much cheaper games they enjoy available.

All in all - one for the collectors rather than the gamers.

RATING: 7.8
This game looks amazing.  I can't wait to play.  Excellent job Marco!

Update:

Played.  An excellent little family game.  The rules are straightforward and simple. The game flows quickly and pleasantly.  The game feels like a race to get 'there and back again', to this effect I feel that playing to 3 for 4 peaks may be best (especially with 2).  There is a significant 'take that' factor, but there are ways to mitigate this through use of the axes, chainsaws etc.  Still, this could be a turn-off for some players.  The game is an absolute pleasure to play with, and a delight to look at.  I am looking forward to many more adventures on the mountains through Timber Tom!  Marco has done a stand up job in both game-play and production on this little gem.  Well worth a look!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a bit of a strange rating, because I feel the gameplay is pretty mediocre.  There isn't a whole lot of complexity to the game, and the fiddling around with trees is a bit tedious.   It'd normally rate this a 5 or a 6.

However, the production quality is exceptional -- certainly in the running for most meticulously thought out and gorgeous game I've ever played -- and unlike anything you'd normally find in a game.  Incredible detail and innovative board design.  For that alone, this rating gets a huge bump.    This is truly a game that I like to look at (probably more than play).   

Probably won't play this one all that often, but as a work of art alone it definitely has a place in my collection.

Update: Finally played. This is an absolute magnet at the game table. People wer elined up to play before they had any idea about the game. This definitely wins most gratuitously overproduced game, at least in my collection, especially for such a small print run game. But ironically, I hate the outer box. The game doesn't really close on its own, unless you slip the box into the original flimsy sleeve. Very annoying.

The game itself wouldn't be too noteworthy if it weren't for the bits. But then again, I don't really care too much about hiking. It's a little silly that in some regards they emphasize in the rules that certain things are realistic, but then at the same time let you plant a tree which blocks someone on a different mountain from the one you're on.

All in all a fun game, but very tactical, and with bash the leader, and a large dose of randomness. This would be a great game to leave setup on a coffee table.

Nice try, but the board has too many equipment sheds and radio hot-spots. You're never really in any "danger". Players can try to block you in with trees, but honestly, you're usually just one turn away from your goal... then add into the mix that you've got axes and chainsaws, well, still no real danger. This is ripe for house rules... which I've not come up with yet.

UPDATE: I've given this away to a friend.

Here are some TENTATIVE house rules to make the game better:

Draw a bad card when changing elevations or moving over water... Or spend one supply.

Heli-radio only to refuge within one elevation step.

Heli-flight only back to base camp.

If you draw a bad card, roll die - odd means you drop your gold.   Take gold back to base camp for safety.

Always draw card in white zone.

For two players, gold is only available on Wolf and Tin.

This game looks amazing, and mechanically is pretty old school. Despite the luck is is very fun. The main downside and it is a big one to me, the game can really only be played four players.

RATING: 4
Players are racing up 2, 3 or 4 peaks to try and recover lost sacks of gold, hidden by an ... eccentric named Timber Tom.  Players take turns moving their hiker figures over the game board, the distance moved dictated by the terrain where they begin their move.  Then they may place between one to four trees on the board to block their opponents, forcing them into either longer paths or making them use their resources to clear the trees.  The winner is the first back with their required sacks of gold.  A simple game of racing and blocking, very easy to teach and play, and almost instantly dismissed ... but... the game looks totally amazing!  To start with, game board is 3-D, with 5 different terrain levels depicted, from flood plains to snow caps.  On top of that, it's a foam core board, studded with holes that the trees and hikers sit firmly in - you could tip it upside down and nothing will move.  The rest of the components are no less spectacular - gold sacks, supplies, resources - all stored snugly in the box lid.  The accessible game mechanics and fantastic components add up to a very fun gaming experience.  Just an amazing production.

Oh noes, one hippie girl talked me into try this because she wanted to play something colourful and everyone of us found that game is really boring.

Certainly lavishly produced, but that doesn't disguise an old fashioned family game of 'take that'. The main activity is planting or moving trees to block the other players, but the leapfrogging lends itself to players in a group conspiring to attack one player (NOT NECESSARILY THE LEADER). A bit too much luck overall, but still a game requiring optimal efficiant play to succeed. But the bits are excellent, the model terrain very impressive. If you're not bothered about lucky game play, or picking on one person, then go for it. Not on my wishlist though.

Oh, my gosh. I am so, so, so impressed. I got my box today directly from Marco Bing.  A QUALITY game. Fantastic componets, great packaging, AND extra pieces included: 1 die (the game only uses 1, 3 trees, 1 treasure bag, 1 supply pack, 1 game pawn that can be painted any color..oh, and even an extra rubber band :) !)  The frames are well punched and the graphics & colors great.  Not only that, a sturdy, well-done Game Summary Card and a well laid out instruction booklet. In addition, the trees are stored in their own box, and the inside bottom of the box is labeled so you know just where to place all the components. The board is 3-D. This game is a bargain. Wow!

For game play--A different little gateway game that is easy to teach. I like the clever way to burn the opposition--grow trees in their path. This is a winner. 

Game is too long for 3 of us when the goal is all 4 mountain tops--reduce winning to 3 treasures. For 4 people we reduced it to 2 treasures, which is the most we would ever do with 4 people.  I also prefer eliminating the cards as the rules suggest doing, but so far my opponents veto that idea.

May, 2010.  I continue to be so impressed with this company.  Today I received this Wollemi Pine Bonus (free) expansion with very nicely printed rules.  Not only that, it included updated Game Guide & Game Summery Card for Timber Tom--both of which are of high quality printing & paper.  

The Wollemi expansion involving tree planting with potential penalties was a pleasant surprise.  I had thought of several possible and trite expansions, so was pleased to see something unexpected.

This is a wonderfully rendered family game that puts to shame Days of Wonder's fine offerings.  Game play is very light, and a four gold sack game takes far too long for what this game offers -- hence the modest rating.

RATING: 7.5
First off let me start off by saying that Marco really put his heart and soul into this game and covered everything one should when designing/publishing a game.

Everything about this game is just plain beautiful. Nothing was spared in the production of this game. There is just so much to say about this game and the designer that I don't even know where to start. I might actually have to make an attempt at my first board game review for this one.

For now though. The game was VERY well planed out in every aspect possible. From the design to production and then to the final shipping phase. I am still amazed that this is all done by Marco himself.

The game is a lot of fun and can be played by exploring two mountain ranges for a shorter game or three or four ranges for a longer game. I suggest trying the three or four if you have time as it makes for more of a challenge and a lot more fun. There are many different ways to go about planning the routes you want to take and many different ways to go about doing so.

The rules book is excellent and provides some really nice examples and there is also a summary sheet included with the game, so that you don't have to keep looking things up in the rule book. Which is always nice to have.

This game is truely a lot of fun and I am very proud to finally own it. I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone. This is great for families, children and gamers also. There is a ton of fun to be had for everyone with this one.

Played this just once with my wife and daughter.  I would really like to play it again.  I gave it an 8 after one play because it felt like the replayability was endless.  Also, it seems like it will take a few replays to figure out how to really use your tree replants.  I thought the game mechanics were fresh.  It's not for Euro players.

Timber Tom is a fairly strightforward race game, as designed, but with mutliple different terrain features, and the interactive ability to block or delay other players with trees.

The artwork however, is very special- the board is a 3D layered affair with mountains and ridges, and the player markers are molded plastic pegs that look like hikers which fit into holes in the foamcore layers.  Add to this the artwork of Marco Bing, and the game is somewhat lifted beyond it's basic roots.

This doesn't seem to be a thrilling or brain-busting game, but it does offer some interactive strategy, and is in the running for both most overproduced and best-looking board game, which makes it nice in and of itself.

Game is fun, feels fast, and you have a very clear idea of what you're needing to do and how to do it--an excellent gateway or family game. My spouse and I enjoyed a two-player game, and it was a very close game.

I am so glad I bit the bullet before they're all gone!

I didn’t like this game! Maybe with more players? (we were 2 players). I didn’t perceive any fun with this game and the theme doesn´t help it either. The board is gorgeous but the gameplay is very boring and repetitive.

I have to play it again to see if I missed something but I don’t see me playing this in the near future.

I played Timber Tom for the first time on 2010, the year I really got into the hobby. At that time I almost always liked every game I played but I hated Timber Tom right from the very beginning.

The only redeeming factor I can think of is that the game is gorgeous with great components, all else is bad. Boring theme, bad gameplay, too long for what it offers and too boring. One of the worst games I have ever played. 

Current Rating: 2.0

For a while I was wondering why I let this one slip by, as I remember seeing all the buzz for the game, but never was tempted to investigate further.

I must have read something about how the game plays, since after playing, I feel like I've seen enough.  The components are impressive and the amount of effort that went in to constructing the game materials is extraordinary. 

However, the underlying game is not convincing.  The biggest problem is the amount of time it takes.  For this type of game, it should be half as long.  I have no problem with rolling dice and action cards, but the game feels way too drawn out and there is too much "take that" for a game of very little complexity.

RATING: 8
Yes, the game is finely crafted and looks amazing.  
But the game is actually fun, as long as you are in a mood to try and stymie the other players.  Random things do happen.  People pick on each other.  Thats the way it is.  Deal with it and have fun.
Good players will be rewarded.  Sloppy, casual, do-gooders will not be rewarded.

Highly produced race game with some interesting elements and great components. The designer’s enthusiasm for the game ranging from constant rule updates/refinements, responses on the forums and work on different expansions are add to the games likability. Rules can be a bit daunting at first, but after a few plays they seem to be relatively intuitive. I have only played the 3 peak version, which I think it a good balance between time and fun.

RATING: 7
First thing I want to say is that Marco did an OUTSTANDING job at producing a stunning game.the beauty of the box, the insert, the board, the pieces , the player mats,  everything...

the rulebook is a bit long but reason has to be that Marco wanted to cover anything. He could have covered it in a few less pages, You want to play the gam instead of going through all these pages...nontheless the rulebook is outstanding.

Now the game I had to play it on the first occasion I could.. actually it was the second occasion but the first one was reserved for Brass. Played 2 player only and also only two mountains. Which is way too short but gives you a pretty good idea how the game would be with more players.

I rate this game a 6 2 player / 2 mountains as the first player has a rather big advantage over the second one. Its like he is one step ahead all the time.
But it was enjoyable.
And you could see the use of the helicopor, axe, supply  during this game.

I rate it a 7 with more players and mountains. Can't rate it higher as it probably takes a little too long for what it is . Maybe I'm wrong here.

Won't score it lower than 7 because I know that friends who aren't into boardgames would like to play this one if it is setup. Not the best boardgame around. Not the best production quality that has to be the Hilinski board I own. But certainly a very close second to that.

As a familygame worth considering getting but I wouldn't wait too long

This game is visually cool.  3-D!  If there were a deluxe addition in wood, it would be a collector's item and I would buy it just for how pretty the game is at the end.  The play is okay, but nice with kids because there is not tons of reading and the strategy isn't too complicated.  Would like to see a Redwood Forest expansion and a Bigfoot, Yeti, Abominable Snowman expansion.  Also, just forest animals could make it more interesting/fun.

Not thrilling after about 15 minutes of play.  Many of your actions (tree-planting, at least), seem to be pointless.  The map has entire regions for which there is almost no reason to visit.  A little repetive.  So much "Take that!" action has to happen, they no one gets anywhere, and FAST! (I mean sloooooooowwwwwww....)

But, man, this guy deserves a major award for prettiest, most over-produced game in years.  The game even comes with a bag, labelled, "Extra Parts".... now that's a publisher who cares!

WARNING: You'll be instantly screaming gimme gimme gimme after reading about this game and seeing the pictures. 

Well, I did...and I can tell you, the game even looks better on your table.

Initial rating after 1 play with 2 (3 mountains): good mix of tactics, a hint of fate (the cards) and short-term strategy. It's more strategical with 2.

I think it'll be even more fun with 3 or 4 too.

Added half a point because the game looks so inviting to play.

NL: Dit is wellicht het mooist uitgevoerde bordspel in de collectie. Moet je gezien hebben. 

Spel is ook leuk: Soort 3d bergwandelracespel, waarbij je als eerste een aantal goudzakken van verschillende bergtoppen moet zien te krijgen en terug te brengen naar het basiskamp.

Impressive production, but I didn't get anything out of the game. There wasn't much in terms of interesting choices to be made. The event cards seem relatively ineffectual, but when you consider how little randomness there is otherwise, for a race game with mild screwage, the difference between drawing a good card and a bad one can dwarf the impact of any other decisions.

Rating based on one 2-player game.  The rating may well go up with more players and/or repeated play, but in this game, we finished in the same turn, in turn order.  The quality of the components is amazing, though, and the game is worth owning just for that.

Topographic map; very cool components. Good for kids; good family game.

You are moving between 4 peaks and trying to get 1-4 treasures on the peaks. You have helicoptor transport, radio transport and axes/saw to help you cut through the forest.

The confrontation comes when you play trees to mess up other people by making them move around the obstacles.

Looks like a great one!

Beautiful game!!  Awesome components.

It was only meant to be a fun race game with some sweet mechanics built around the fun 3-d board.  It is slightly too long to earn an 8, which is my max for a game that is just for fun.  I like my 2 player fun games to go 30 minutes max.  (This is also fun with 3 or 4, but it gets longer.)

Try the newer expansions suggested by the creator (Marco Bing)in the forums.

A beautiful hike through the mountains! The components, board, cards, etc. are amazing. A well crafted and designed board game...a definite labor of love...and thank you for that! The game is integrated with story, theme, and every component and bit of card text supports the gaming experience! This was a difficult game to find...we were only able to purchase it from the publisher...but it was well worth every bit of searching.

Now, this is not a game we will pull out all of the time...it comes out when we are in the mood like many games we own. The game comes with a small expansion already included...special pine trees with rules for placement! We always play with the expansion...much more fun!

This is a clever game; think of it as the Euro version of Outdoor Survival.  Ok don't as it is FAR better than it.  It has both a screwage factor as well as just a simple puzzle feel in how to best move to your destination.  The more players you have, the more interaction, so try and play with as 3-4.  The rules read a bit more complicated than the game really is (but they are very illustrative).

RATING: 9
After two plays, both with 4 players. Obviously, the compponent quality is mind blowing and the value is incredible. The first time we played to two bags of gold and the resources were not as vital. The second time we played to 3 bags and the game was much better. There was also far more opportunity to gang up on the early leader, who was too efficient for her own good. I look forward to playing this again and think that 3 bags will be the sweet spot.

Beautiful game that reminds me of Quoridor in that you're racing to a position on the board while the other player(s) try to stop you by throwing down obstacles that block your progress. The cards and the die add random elements that keep things interesting. Perhaps a little long for what it is.

The fantastic production values and beautiful artwork belie the complete abstraction of the game mechanics. This is like Quoridor went out and got itself pimped with Ice Flow. I hate Ice Flow's failure to blend theme and abstract gameplay. Strike one. I like Quoridor but Timber Tom takes away the best quality of Quoridor: fast, elegant cutthroat action on a small board in 10 minutes. Strike two.

It's not bad, but it's a game you'd play with kids who are enamored of the bits and pieces in the game.

The cards in the game, representing unpredictable events, could have been better integrated. Right now, they just function like Chance cards in Monopoly or event cards in Um Reifenbreite. Yet taking them out makes the game seem weird and barren.

Enlarge Quoridor by many, many spaces, insert many, many walls, and make random spaces do random things when you land on them, and that's Timber Tom in a nutshell. It's not bad, but it's obsolete next to Quoridor, which offers the same amount of fun, only denser as it's compressed into 10 minutes.

The theme weakens the game, as it has nothing to do at all with the mechanics. A theme revolving around wizards with magic powers, able to sprout and fell trees anywhere on the board, and teleport at different portals on the board, would make more sense.

RATING: 6.5
Too long and repetitive for what it is.  Little significant interaction despite the fact that you are constantly throwing blocks up against other players.  Blocking people with trees is free, so there is no decision not to.  The movement is straightforward with few surprises, so it is a base game of optimization with a metagame of negotiation ("don't block, me block him").  

Three mountains is just too long for what it offers, two mountains make the helipads too powerful.  Perhaps there is a balance, but that's what playtesting should have been for.  

That said it is a joy to play before it outlasts its welcome.  If it weren't so repetitive I'd be more into it.  It could use a story arc (various goals).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Timber Tom is a heavily themed game presented in a sumptuous format.  The board is completely beautiful and unique and evokes old school topographic games like Fireball Island.  Components are of uniform top quality.

While it is roll and move (sort of) at its core, Timber Tom feels like much more due to a wealth of small and subtle ways to gain movement advantage.  There always seems like there is a lot to do, and a lot of decisions to make.  The game play can be brutal in a "take that" fashion as planting trees to hinder your opponents is a key mechanism.

We are very much looking forward to expansions to get some bears roaming the mountainsides.  :)

Really spectacular components in a small publisher, Days of Wonder kind of way.  It is interesting how you plant trees to block your opponents and have supplies that you can replenish at times, but I will say it seems that there isn't quite enough good tension in it, since with decent management, the trees often can have little effect.  The decisions were not terribly enticing as once you embarked on a path, you carried that out for a little while before having to decide on the next one.  Two mountain peaks is a must, as more would really drag the game out.  I do have to admit my bias against race games as well, of which this is one.

RATING: 7
Certainly could be playable as a family game, but the author marketed this as a game for all boardgamers, not just kids, and I think he was correct. Though kids could probably understand some of the basics, true understanding of the game requires spatial reasoning, pre-planning, and careful observation of the play area. So, would it work for kids? Sure. Is it better with adult players? Absolutely. I honestly don't get the "only really good when played with kids" comments you see about it.

Be forewarned - if you have someone in your group prone to Analysis Paralysis, this could certainly be a game that falls prey to that, especially with a full house of four players.

I very much admire the care which went into the design and even more so the production of this game. For a small independent publisher, it's fine work. Game play is on the light side for my personal tastes, and the theme, which is very consistent in components, is a bit hit-or-miss in execution: it's a race game, but you're as much concerned with making trees appear and disappear as you are with selecting a good route. It isn't likely to see the table often when I play with adults, but I think it will serve nicely for play with my grandchildren

[PYXI 08 First-print edition (01-00010)] {Hiking; utility-cards, roll-and-move; optimal 4p} I am glad that I have this game.  It is a decent family game.  It's interactive and fun, though I am concerned about the replayability.  It is very thematic.  The rule is not intuitive enough to explain clearly but players have no difficulty in picking up the rule after a few turns.  For me, Timber Tom is a tactical game - players could make meaningful decisions but it is not easy to define a long-term strategy.

The rulebook is nicely organized and the player aid is handy but there are still some ambiguities.   The examples in the rulebook are very useful.

Timber Tom is an attractive game, very eye-catching.  The look and feel is excellent, which greatly enhances game experiences.  It's also nicely produced.  The component quality is top-class.  However, players need to carefully place their pawn; otherwise it's easy to damage or leave marks near the placeholder.

This is an excellent attempt for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

Gorgeous game that is way over the top in the visual side. Basically, this is the most "pimped" out version of a race/puzzle game you could get.

Played once three player (two mountains). Incredibly beautiful and well-made game. The designer provides great customer support (answering questions quickly and being proactive about contacting new owners). The game itself is an interesting tactical game of trying to maximize one's moves to get an advantage over the other players so you can retrieve treasures and return to the base camp first. Of course, if you do get an advantage, all the other players start trying to block you with trees. There are definitely some ways to slow somebody down, but there really was no way to really hamper somebody significantly, if they had enough resources. I think there is more to the game than I figured out after one playing. There are a few strategies (use resources fast and re-stock at base camp, plod along or somewhere in between) to try and it seems like they are pretty equal and it will come down to a close finish. Definitely interested in trying out the Rogue Bear expansion to see if that adds another element to the game like the Baby Monster in Manhattan does.

Components are absolutely marvelous. The game is very good, you will have fun and excitement with it. The rule book needs some improvement. This is a great game for kids (ages 5 to 10) but not with the rules that the game comes with. You have to make your own rules and your kids will love this game. The rules that the game comes with is for older kids and adults. But spend a little time to make rules for little kids and you have a winner!

Don't let my rating fool you, this game has strategy and no huge flaws ...no heavy exploits, and the random parts aren't cripplingly so- although on the flip side of the coin, the tree planting has less impact on most games than what the effort of implementation would lead you to believe.

As I've said before, I'm totally superficial. Bought this for two reasons, to support an obvious labour of love by the author, and of course, the amazing bits. Yeah, it ended up costing me a ton of money, but when I open the box, I don't mind so much.

And turns out the game is decent too. It's a race game, mostly dependent on your strategy, but just a dash of luck with a deck of random event cards. We didn't care if the events could be bad, we had a ball drawing one every chance we could.

I love this game! At first it seems like a simple walk in the park (get it?), but then it gets mean! Trees start to pop up full grown in your path, and after a while you have to run back to a cabin to get axes to cut them down to clear a path...then a helicopter flies overhead with the grinning face of your opponent leering down as he flies toward another mountain.  Great Fun! Give it try before the limited run sells out!

I'd say as a family style game, the game play is rated at 6 to 7  (closer to 7+ with the expansion pines), but you really don't appreciate the quality of the product until it's in your hands (I didn't anyway).  Great bits push this up to a rating of 8 for me.

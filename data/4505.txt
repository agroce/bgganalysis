I was introduced to this game in France.  I was working on a farm, and I played it with the family and other farmhands every night for sixth months (I'm not exaggerating--we might have missed one or two nights because of livestock issues). It is the most fun I've ever had playing a game.  I know some of that has to do with the people I was with, but really for a game for 4 or 5 people I've yet to play anything better or more enjoyable or with more re-playability.

Tarot (I know it as 'French Tarot') with 5 people is a brilliant game: the bid winner names a card and the holder of that card is then secretly in alliance with the bid winner.

Tarot is easy to learn for players of trick-taking games (spades, bridge, etc.) and unusual that it is a 5 person card game.

RATING: 7
By the number of comments I can tell there are not many players from France that roam BGG's site, because this card game is played a LOT in France. it shares similarities with Bridge and Belotte (another traditional french card game). It's a card counter's dream and is quite enjoyable except when a player takes it too seriously (and somehow there is always at least one at the table). It is an easy game: it demands that you have a grasp of probabilities and that you stay focused on the players' cardplay. It plays differently with 3,4 or 5 players.

Started as a game and should be kept that way. Got many years ago an Aquarian deck and a small stapled book mostly about reading fortunes from the local 'hippie' bookshop in Lismore, Noah's Ark (same place I got my excellent Chess Variations book - they direct imported from the US). Fortunately the book included a 3 player card game in the back to show other uses for the deck - many games played with my cousin.
Recently got a cheap unused copy from an op-shop of the ubiquitous Rider deck - not so good for games as it has poor markings for suit and number.

RATING: 6
I actually like it, but my ambivalence towards trick taking games takes its full measure here : I don't really like counting cards, and there's 21 to count here if you limit yourselves to trumps. For this reason I will always remain very limited in my proficiency with this game. Really, I don't even try. I tend to prefer belote now but it's still a fun and convivial game that most people like and know how to play (at least in France). It's best with five people I think, where we play with the rule that the taker calls out a king, which is his ally for the round. The king is not revealed straight away so that adds a little suspense and suspicion, it's pretty cool.

Probably the most popular card game in France, this picturesque bidding, trick-taking and trumps game plays like a slightly simpler and faster moving version of Bridge.

Yet to play. Denied the opportunity to experience this game with experienced French-taught players and instead was forced to endure a session of "even-less-thinking" ("hee-hee!") Apples to Apples. Viva la LA...

Update: Now played a handful of times with a real live Frenchman. I can sense Tarot hides quite a bit of depth under its simplistic play. But like other traditional cards games, it fails to excite much. Still, perhaps with continued play, I'll fall under its spell.

Although I am an American and have never been to France, this is my favorite trick taking game; superior to Bridge I would say. I would give it a 10 if it were not for the somewhat complex math required for the scoring. Perhaps the most elegant of the Tarot/Tarock/Tarocchi games currently played.

The art in the cards linked is THE BEST ART I have ever seen for a card game, and I really don't care about such things.  Absolutely Beautiful, I will own it. Edit - and Now I do, awesome set. 

EDIT - Have now played one of the many variations for this game. It is hard to give one rating as enjoyment can likely depend on which rules and variant you play, I played the French version I believe which has one person who bids successfully playing against 3 other players and my rating is based on that version. I LARGELY prefer the Slovanian Tarock game to this one for many reasons, see my comments on that page for why. 

I dislike the forced trump play here though the more I play the more I wonder if its actually neccessary in this game versus almost every other game I've seen it in as here you are playing against 3 others and can use the rule to your advantage. Generally though overtrumping team mates, no way to throw off, it just feels terrible after not playing this kind of rule for so many years, its a bg adjustment.  

Bidding is good, declarations bad, random bonus for getting a good hand. Variants would hugely improve the game and there are probably tons, peoples ratings including mine would hugely vary on what rules they are playing with. The thing is with the forced play, it can help the player playing against the field since once he figures out what suit the others are missing, he can keep leading it and the others have to keep wasting their trump trumping over each over, don’t really like it but as I mentioned it could actually be neccessary here. Definetely some neat aspects here but those certain rules ruin for it for me and games coming after this improved on the system IMO. 

There is a fair size memory element here, not just due to the usual card carding but also due to the forced play, if your tracking who is out of which suit it helps you to throw points in the right direction. The scoring system of the fool, 1 and 21 means sometimes you have a good hand you cant play, othertimes your hand is only average and you’ll be able to play it because you have some of those cards, largely like the whole game I am on the fence with this aspect, sometimes you have to chuck a good hand which sucks but worse it is rewarding those who get dealt the right cards and it makes it fairly easy to make your bid as such if you have them instead of rewarding the trick play more it rewards you for getting dealt the right cards.   

[u]Update:[/u] Played more and yeah I typically hate the forced trump play especially if you have to OVER trump your own partner but it kinda works in this game, at least the version I am playing where one person calls it and plays against 3 others.  I still think the over-trumping sucks but you can force them to keep playing their trump thereby depleting them of it, it can also work against you as the caller but more often this rule helps the caller.  Calling it is TOO dependant on the 3 big point cards, you almost have to have 2 to just to be able to call it due to how the scoring works.  Other than that I kinda like the scoring here, the subtraction and then the multiplying seems to work good less the earlier point made.

A virtual unknown in the U.S., this trick-taking game predates the use of the Tarot deck for cartomancy by at least 2 centuries. Unlike many U.S. trick-takers, the "contract" of card points to take is fixed, and instead the bids are "wagers" of game points and handicaps that one player can make contract playing against all others. Players of Spades and Pinochle will recognize elements of both in the gameplay. Most of the complexity is in the scoring.

I've played this quite a bit during summer holidays in France more than fifteen years ago and rediscovered it just recently. The fixed trumps turn some usual strategies of trick taking on their heads, e.g. sometimes its a good tactic to play a suit where you know that you will get trumped by your opponents. Together with the bidding rules, this offers enough interest to make it our current favorite for trick taking, but as with most traditional card games, I guess that it will mostly run on automatic once you've played too many games.

I own several packs: two different packs of French Tarot (French suits, 78 cards, Carta Mundi's Versailles pack is nice), Piemontese Tarocco (Italian suits, 78 cards), Bolognese Tarocchino (Italian suits, 62 cards, my favourite pack) and Sicilian Tarocco (Italian suits, 63 cards, very curious pack).

As a game not worth much, however, I did once in my youth take the time to learn how to read cards and it does entertain a lot of people, not least younger (and older) reps of the fairer sex.

The 5-player version is extremely chaotic and luck driven (I would rate it a 4). The 3-player version is plain boring. On the other hand, there is a lot of strategy in the 4-player version. The bidding process is much simpler than in Bridge, which makes Tarot a superior game in my view because you don't have to memorize pages of information, and the card play is more subtle.

Rating for this entry is a little bit generalized overall opinion of different tarock games. Some notes for specific games below.

Strohmann tarock: Short tarock for two players. There is quite a bit of luck because you only know a little bit over half of your hand when bidding. A good filler for two players.

Rating: 7

French Tarot: Relatively easy tarok for 3-4 players. I like how the 1,21 and excuse/joker lower the amount of points you need to gain. This forces you to try playing with a little bit more risky with lesser hands too. It feels very weird to play as you don't shuffle cards before each deal, only lift the deck once.

RATING: 6.5
I played the French version of Tarot (the based version) and found it kind of strange. There are some subtleties that are opposite that of modern games, such as not sorting your cards at first and not shuffling cards before a deal. The mechanics are similar to most trick taking games, but the scoring is where it gets odd. One player bids themselves in as the leading player and they have a teammate which is chosen at random and not announced until the selected partner card is shown, so part of the turn you are not sure who your teammate is. Then if you win or lose, depending on which cards you were able to collect, the score won or lost is take or paid to each player, causing large swings. Interesting game, especially for the 1400s, but not my preferred trick taking game.

So far I have tried only Slovenian Tarok and Hungarian Tarokk and was truly impressed by the first one.
With 4 players the Slovenian Tarok is an enjoyable festival of negative points - and I like it!

Cego: Feels different. You aren't totally helpless if you happen to receive bad hand cards. In fact, you only need hand cards with good scores in them.

Hungarian Tarokk is a game that needs more tries, eager to play again though. A really complicated one, illustrated or not.

I own a Piatnik's 54-card Austrian Tarock pack and a Carta Mundi's 78-card French Jeu de Tarot pack.
For now that is enough. Even with those two card packs, there are amazingly many gaming options!

The only problem with this magnificent deck is it's card stock quality - could be better. Other than that, it's flawless and once sleeved it's more than ready to play.

Played mostly French tarot with 5 players. With four I prefer Slovenian. The thing that makes this for me is the unknown partners.

Although (French) Tarot doesn't have the complex bidding and communication of Bridge and Mu, the trick playing part is more fascinating than either! Unlike Bridge, it's not about winning the most tricks. It's about winning specific cards, namely the lowest trump and the high cards of the non-trump suit. What makes this especially tricky is:

* the strict trick taking rules (you must trump, and over-trump) 
* the very large trump suit (21 cards out of 78)
* The Excuse (a special card that permits you not to follow suit/trump)

It has unusual scoring, but it quickly makes sense.

An enjoyable card game.  More of a classic card game (Bridge, Pinochle, etc) than the Euros I've been playing of late, but definitely a game I look forward to playing again.

I played my first trick-taking game with the tarot deck last night. The images in the deck were very confusing and the game itself was quite simple and boring. Frankly I don't understand why any game would be better with Tarot deck than with a regular deck.

Especially good at 4 players, and in tournaments (by teams, with identical deals from table to table, which supresses random).

other numbers of players (from 2 to 6) give too much place to random.

But still very good for playing on trains, on the beach, on vacation, and with every kind and age of people. Much fun.

Absolutely my favourite "classic" card game. I've played this game (the 4p version with 54 cards) almost every week during my school years (high-school, university) resulting in 2K+ games. Unfortunately, I do not meet the group any more to play.

RATING: 10
There is almost nothing this game cant do.  Fortune telling, card games, building houses.  I have written stories with the cards and used them to create RPG adventures.  They make excellent conversation pieces.  They change the rules of any card game you know.  I have a custom pack made from multiple decks of playing cards and sharpies which i carry with me constantly.  Try it yourself, maybe youll see what I mean.

French Tarot - a game of forced trumping and sacrificial card play in a bidder vs the rest format which is the main weakness of the game for me. I just don't find it as interesting as games with partnerships and interesting bidding.

Intrigueing trick-taking game with contracts. It's hard for me to find anyone to play this with. That's why I also have a computer edition based on the rules of the Fédération Française du Tarot.

RATING: 7
A traditional trick-taking card game played with the tarot deck. A game of nonverbal communication, it's all about playing around your opponent, figuring out what cards he has, and capturing the most valuable ones. Bidding can actually cchange the rules of the game, leading to good variety. A fun one to introduce to friends who think the tarot deck is just for fortune telling!

**

My rating refers to the family of ingenious trick-taking card games popular across Europe since the renaissance (e.g., French Tarot, Austrian Tarock, Italian Tarocchi) not the relatively modern divinatory hokum.

What intrigues me with the French version is the fact that the defenders also end up placing bids.  I think this is my favorite variation on the Tarot trick taking theme.

Love this card game.  The asymmetrical aspect, and the shifting partnerships are great fun.  The bidding is tense, and the scoring is awesome.  All the players' scores always add up to zero, so someone's gain is another's loss.  Not sure why it isn't more popular here in the US.  For some reason most Americans have no idea it's a card game and think it's just a fortune telling device...

This is actually an odd rating I'm giving this game because we play it with our own set of house rules where the Major Arcana is always trump. You play partners & bid for the right to pick 5 cards in the blind & bury 5 cards that still count for your side. We think it's a great game.

I own several decks of Jeu de Tarot (not the oracle decks), and received my first one during a trip to France in 1994.  Great trick taking game that plays best with four.  I've played hundreds of hands and don't think I'll ever tire of trying to finesse the 1.

RATING: 7
Classic trick taking card game using a specialized deck of 78 cards that includes 14 cards in each of 4 suits (the normal 13 cards from a traditional deck plus a "Cavalier" valued between the jack and queen), non-suited trump cards valued 1 to 21, and an Excuse card. In the normal 4 player game, players bid to obtain control of the hand, get to switch in 6 cards from a kitty, and must cover their contract by going against a team formed of the other 3 players - contracts are easier to complete the most "oudlers" (21 & 1 trump, Excuse) your side collects.

Posséder. De la grande classe. Jeu de levées (mais les contrats sont plus spécifique que le 500). Celui qui mise le plus fort joue contre les autres (on ne joue pas en équipe comme dans beaucoup de jeux de levées).

The [url=http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/shadowscapes/index.shtml]artwork[/url] is very pretty. The five suits will be useful for simulating many other games. I intend to play Zarcana/Gnostica (with Looney pyramids). Am using Fantasy Flight (Orange package) clear 70 x 120 mm sleeves.

Have twenty-three sets. Mostly just for looking at:  Tarot to Go, Miniature Tarot, HP Lovecraft Tarot, Wisdom of the Australian Animals, The Lost Zodiac, Tarot of the Cat People, Rider Deck, Gill Tarot, Crow's Magick, Dragon Tarot, LotR Tarot, Ravenloft Tarokka (1994 version), Mythic Tarot, Healing with the Angels, Linweave Tarot, Tarot of the White Cats, Gypsy Witch Fortune Telling Cards, 1JJ Swiss Tarot, Tarot of the Elves, Cagliostro Tarot, Arthurian Tarot, Pathfinder Harrow, Muroidea Rat Tarot (framed).

Yeah, only  about a half dozen of these are "games," though we sometimes use them within an RPG as, for example, a Deck of Many Things.

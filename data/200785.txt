Ok, will play if in the mood.
I played twice on Board game Arena, I like the area control aspect, I like the theme, (it's kind of funny having Isaac Newton work on the Automobile)

It will probably work well with kids, because of how simple it is to play, but I'm not good at winning (coming in last place both times) so I'd like to try it with kids and give myself a timer to keep from having AP) 

Good Solid game, and if I was willing to get better at it, I might enjoy it more, I just like combat games more I guess.

Very pleasant with 4-5 players. It's fun to piggy-back on other players. However the game does not scale very well: With 2 players, we found the game quite dull and we will not play again with just 2 (and since we mostly play 2 players...). With 3, the game is also different since there are 3 bonus to get on each invention, it seems very important (but also quite easy) to be on each invention card to get a little something.

Speelt minder goed met 2, maar ik geef mijn verwachte mening voor 4 spelersvariant.

Je hebt 4 uitvinders met beperkte kennis, maar je kan deze opwaarderen in het spel.
Je legt je blokjes op uitvindingen, en strijdt om het krijgen van deze kaart of de fiches die erop liggen.
TIP: werk vooral aan het upgraden van de uitvinders met waarde 9 en 6.  Die vragen slechts een beperkte bijkomende inspanning tgo diegene met waarde 3.

good game , puzzle mechanism , the theme is not there.
a little chaotic at 4 players (to difficult to anticipate the strategic options of others players).

RATING: 3
A dull majorities and priorities mechanism gives rise to a very, very repetitive game whose tradeoffs in the beginning are more or less the same as those in the end. Randomness in how the inventions of the various eras fall can have a big say in making or breaking your game: this is not a Good Thing because the placement mechanism itself is very precise (despite its simplicity). Meager production values which at times have to wondering how long the material is going to last (number tiles fit tightly into designated holes, putting stress on the edges where the cardboard was punched through) combined with a high price then finish off what remains. Genuinely a disappointing offering, on several levels.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'd appreciate if the holes in the player boards were slightly larger so that they don't destroy all the tokens that you're supposed to shove in there. :( Also, not great at 2p.

Fred Henry, après un Conan bourré de figurines, revient vers un jeu plus petit, moins volumineux. Oui, bon, sans figurines, quoi... Les inventeurs est un jeu qui se rapproche plus de 'les batisseurs" , du même auteur. Il est de notoriété publique, voir écrit dans les statuts du groupe jeux que je DETESTE les bâtisseurs. Les inventeurs remontent un peu le niveau avec plus d’interactivité. Avec votre équipe de 4 génies, vous allez devoir inventer la roue jusqu'à l’énergie atomique (Je vous rassure, ce n'est pas aussi long que Civilization). Chaque génie a des compétences parmi 4 (les maths, la chimie, la physique, et les jeux...euh la mécanique. Quoi, les jeux ne sont pas une compétence ?) et devront participer ensemble à la réalisation d'inventions. Avec des points de victoire à gagner à la fin. Oui, parce que le but de toute personne sur terre, c'est de gagner des points de victoire.

Pour 2 à 5 inventeurs, pour des parties de 45 minutes environ

The "theme" of the game appealed to me. Picked up via a math trade. A pretty light, simple and fairly quick family game. The kids enjoy this and all of our plays have been as family game. I think that there is a little bit more that can explored in the decision making to add some depth.

Lélegzetelállító kivitelezés, számomra izgalmas téma. Maga a alapmechanika nagyban emlékeztet az építőmesterekre, de szerintem jobb annál, ezzel a többség dologgal megbolondítva. Viszont valahogy mégse kerekedik ki a játék, egyrészt túl hamar vége van, pont amikor kezdene beindulni, bumm, másrészt egy kicsit egyutasnak érzem. Egyértelműen nem annyira éri meg az elején kártyákat vinni, hanem érdemesebb a statokat betolni a célszámra, míg a végén már a kártya a nyerő. Csak így meg a játék kétharmadában, pont a találmányokkal nem foglalkozik senki, amiről pedig a játék szól elvileg, ami fura.
De nem rossz, könnyed, egyszerű darab, amit elő lehet venni bárkivel.

Excellent game. This game feels like what splendor *should* be. It has good decisions, great interaction, enough of a theme, but still simple rules.

It's similar to the other builders games by the same designer, but feels like it has a lot more control. I hated in the builders games having to 'waste' some of the resources on people when building some things, and the game was much more focused on bin packing those resources efficiently.

RATING: 7.5
Components: really good quality, although I'm a bit concerned with the tokens in and out from the Inventors
Complex: easy to teach and learn
Weight: light/ family
Players: 4 or 5 better
Length: 30 to 45 mins
Mechanics: worker placement, area control
Decisions: enough for a family game, should I use this inventor in this invention or should I wait, which reward I am interested in, should I refresh all my inventors now?
Opinion: after reading a lot about the game, I was a bit worried about it. First of all I must say that I found it a bit expensive for this kind of game, but, on the other hand, is a really good family game.
You take control of a group of inventors from five available, and each of them with different capabilities. With that group, you have to work on several inventions through time (is funny to see Newton discovering the fire or Archimedes discovering the revolver).
During each of your turns you can use one of your inventors, or refresh all of them (once you use one, he is tired and is taking a nap). When you use one of them, you place several cubes on one of the inventions available, depending on the knowledge of the one you are using.
And... once an invention is completed, rewards are distributed....you have 3 rewards on each of the inventions: the invention itself (giving points, and more if you get a set) and 2 random tokens, these tokens can be a coffee (to wake up your inventors for free), additional knowledge, a joker for your set of inventions, and the options to increase your knowledge. Because you can increase what your people knows, as each of them have 4 different skills, and they can be improved (following its on order from 1 to 4).
All this is done through 3 eras, and, in the end, you will score for special tokens with points, for the inventions gathered (more if you have sets) and for each inventor reaching the ideal level of knowledge.
In a nutshell, a really good family game, with easy rules, fast play and enough decisions to have fun

Pretty quick set collection with some engine building. Art is lovely and it's fn that the player olours are so assymetrical. Both in characters and ability values.
Played with two and that's... not the best. Too easy to just leech with a single cube. In fact, due to how easy leeching is with three rewards on every card, I'd suggest playing with 4 or 5.

The game is what you'd expect from the designer of Master Builders if he wanted to make a Knizia game. So (instead of dice, see below) you use your Master Builders, I mean inventors, to send cubes to inventions, aim cards that are much like the cards in [geeklist=196880]a bunch of Knizia games[/geeklist] like Age of War, "build" these together like buildings are constructed in Blue Moon City and the three biggest contributors get rewards like in Blue Moon City but also like in a few games from the bunch linked above, you can increase your chances for later cards with some rewards. Also, get rewards for certain sets of cards like in Age of War. Oh, and you don't take the last contested cards, like in another bunch of Knizias, e.g. King Arthur: The Card Game.

Whatever, influences aside, I think there is nothing wrong with the game, and it's easier to enjoy the first play than the first play of Master Builders, probably because it's more interactive and has a clearer arc.

Finally played for the first time and it's a fun game.  I played with two but more people would create a sense of urgency.  The artwork is great but the rulebook was about 99% useful.  That 1% is for a couple things/actions that were left out we didn't realize until late in the game.  I would be cautious of some of the online walk-through's on You Tube.  They say you can place an attribute chip on your character at any time in the game to upgrade them.  This is partially true.  What they don't say is that you need to upgrade one level at a time.  

You can't replace a '1' in mechanics with a '3' or '4'.  It needs to be a '2'.  Also, the reward chips that get placed on an invention were a bit short.  In one breath the rulebook says to remove any unclaimed rewards out of the game.  By the time you get to the third age, however, you will have an empty bag if you don't recycle them.  Anyway, fun game.  Will definitely hang onto and play again in the future.

Met the designer, Frédéric, very nice guy.  

Simple Synopsis:
Gameplay involves each player having a stable of four historical inventors each of which generates resources.  These resources are used to complete recipes on invention cards.  When a recipe/invention is finished, rewards are divided up among players based on area control.  Rewards might be simple VP, the ability to refresh all your inventors without taking an action, or the ability to upgrade one of your inventors' resource production (for example).  Once players have worked through 3 sets (ages) of cards, final scoring takes place including accounting for certain sets of collected inventions. (Yeah, I've left a lot out.)

Quick Review:
I liked it enough that I wished I'd had a chance to play against the designer.  (Apparently he was giving away free copies to anyone who beat him.)  So I'll be looking for this once it's officially released.  A few different ways to work on VP goals means that even if you don't quite get the reward you want, you might be able to focus on a different path,  Beautiful art is always a plus.  Not a monstrous brain burner or big bad euro, but there's plenty to think about and play feels fulfilling.

Nice job, Frédéric!

Using your inventors you are trying to 'invent' different things. It is area control for 1/2/3rd place items and you are trying to collect points and upgrade you inventors in the process.

There's a few too many euro games that you play once or twice and then have little desire to play again - this is one of them. I think it's the "bidding" mechanism of placing cubes on symbols for ownership that makes it a bit bland. It's not quite tactical or sharp enough. Other than that, it's a fairly unremarkable set collection game. My daughter, however, loves it. There's something about collecting sequential cards that appeals to her (and perhaps kids in general).

This is a game that is a bit hard to describe other than it has a bit of set collection.  But that doesn't earn it points for being unique because nothing felt unique or interesting about it.

In this game players each have a set of 4 inventors and each one has a unique set of skills across 4 different categories.  Each round across 3 ages a set of inventions will be placed in a row and players take turns adding cubes to these inventions by using their inventors.  When an invention is filled with cubes the top 3 players based on majority get either the invention itself or one of the two tokens on it which can be either points, special one-time actions, or upgrade the skills of their inventors.

First of all the game is even more horrible with just 2 or 3 players because all players usually get something out of a completed invention for just dropping a cube on any invention being worked on.  Even with playing at 4 or 5 where players actually compete for this control the game just isn't interesting, fun, or long enough to pull any strategy from the mechanics.

A relaxed, easy going filler game. 
Solid mechanism and smooth gameplay makes this a fun experience!
But dont get me wrong, there are some though decisions you have to make. When completing an invention, which is the object of the game, you need to choose from three different rewards, each one with different scoring abilities at the end of the game or short term effects - like giving you an extra action next round for example.

Un bon petit jeu rapide et accessible qui se lance rapidement avec des joueurs pas forcément bien aguerris.

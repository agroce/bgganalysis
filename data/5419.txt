I quite liked this - even though it reminded me slightly of Age of Steam, which I don't like.  But this is much more forgiving and much cleaner.  There's less luck, too.  There's also a bit of Attica, Through the Desert and various other Euros in here (I think this came before Attica), so there's not much new about it.

Aside from the well-know dreadful art, it's main problem is one of speed.  Boy has this got the possibility of AP!  Play with a slow player and they can take 10-15 mins to think out their turn.  Our first game of this took 2 hours and 40 mins.  I know that'll come down, but rather than use the 8 turn rule, I'd sooner give everyone something like a chess clock to make them shift.

RATING: 6
This one bears the hallmarks of both Colovini (a certain dry abstractness) and Schacht (simple yet clever systems; the way in which turn order and available actions are changed is especially neat).  Strategy seems fairly obvious: the oracle bonuses are key, try to get markets into cities that will score highly when it is cheap, don't run out of tiles.  The game resolves into a highly tactical struggle to squeeze the maximum points out of every move.  There is a certain repetitiveness to play and downtime is an issue with four players.

RATING: 5.5
{1 play â€¢ 3 player} I want to like this more, because, as someone else here stated quite elegantly, it nicely balances a 'connection' game with a 'growth' game.  But... the downtime is tough, what with trying to 'see' your best move(s) and the mid-to-end-game market point figuring... it can drag.  And *I* was one of the main culprits!  But when a game has very little luck (or chaos) in it, I think it's okay to take some time with some of your moves - you kind of need to with game like these.  Playing this only proved how amazing Through the Desert is - feels just as meaty, but it *moves*.  However, I really love the turn order mechanic here - brilliant.  Throws in just enough randomness and, best of all, does away with seating order at the table (often a BIG problem with "deep" games).  Ultimately, I think my rating for this will go up after more plays... the problem is, I'm not jonesin' for more plays.

Nice idea, but my brain rebels against having to look at each "location" on the board and counting how many connections it has to other locations. The design of the playing pieces don't make this any easier, either. No desire to ever play again.

Board colour is very poor and has been much commented on.  There is a clash with the yellow tiles.  Game subject to AP, but quite absorbing.  Lost first game due to oversight, that connections to unbuilt city locations still add to valid connections.  Well constructed game that I would be happy to play again, but which could have been so much better with different graphics..

The more I play this the more I like it. Speculative placing of markets on villages seems a weak strategy since it is generally easy for others to avoid converting them to cities and in any case the "direct connection to your city" rule for activating markets will leave many of these stranded and inactive. 
Other than that it supports a wide range of strategies and every tile placement is crucial. Love the turn order selection mechanic that keeps the races for Oracle control tense to the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not a bad game.  I think I'd like with more as it would expand the board.  Needs a second play, tho.  It's tough as you need to build up but also need to get markets on the board so you can sell markets to get points to expand more.

RATING: 7
It's true that in the first play things can be hard to see here but I think this can be a good game after several plays. At least, it's something different apart from the new breed of eurogames.

This is not a family game, it's a hard meaty game only to be played with though guys. But, my gaming group doesn't like this kind of AP prone abstract dryness... That said, Magna Grecia hasn't got any future in my collection. Should I keep it in my shelves only to see how it gets older and dusty finding me unable to play it anymore? or should I have to trade it away and forget it?

What a pity!

On paper, the game is perfect. It's a network building game with shared incentives that plays in 60 - 90 minutes. Actions are simple and limited but create a big sandbox to play in. So why aren't I in love? I'm not sure. Certainly the color scheme is poor. Also, the restrictions on tiles to play feel a bit too constraining. It's certainly a solid 7. Whether it bumps to an 8 with repeated plays, I'm not sure

A few fairly simple rules give rise to a number of options and difficult decisions every turn - which will usually impact on the possibilities open to you next turn - so there is a fair amount to think about. The more we play Magna Grecia the more I enjoy it. It is a fairly deep, multifaceted, game - with each game we've seen new tactics and options opening up (for instance we've still to fully explore the tactics around initial placement of oracles) - and like a bottle of good red wine it improves with each tasting (and, even better, it feels like there's still plenty left before we'll get to the bottom of it).

Apart from our first attempt, our games have been pretty tight (with one 3 player game even ending in a 3-way tie - the winner being decided on the tie-breaker of most tiles left in hand) so each move is crucial. Despite this, we've found that Magna Grecia plays fairly quickly but, like all games of this nature, it could become bogged down by overly serious players attempting to maximise their score every turn by analysing every option. Perhaps there are some who think that is the 'proper' way to play it, but this would make the 'down time' between turns stretch enormously and would likely kill the enjoyment factor by turning it into a purely abstract mental exercise. I would suggest a chorus of loud raspberries should you encounter the problem.  Backed up by stronger measures if necessary,

I liked my one short game of this a lot.  It was like Tigris and Euphrates light.  But getting the concept across to the other first-time players was difficult and I must not have done a very good job.  It was one of those moments as a game explainer which I dread: feeling like I'm explaining too much while at the same time fearing to miss a critical rule and be blamed for it later.

I need to give this a try again, but I'll need to figure out a better way to explain it first.

RATING: 8
A really cool game on a very ugly board. Points come from two sources: markets connected to cities (provided they are either your cities or connected to your cities) or cities connected to oracles (provided your city is the biggest one the oracle is connected to.

Points are also money during the game; they buy city tiles and markets, so it is a bit of a spend-money-to-make-money system. You start with 12 points, but can generate more during the game by selling markets for their current point value.

Simple turns are a hallmark of both Colovini and Schacht. Build or expand cities and build roads. Then pay to place a market. That would be nice, but their is a third option - refresh your supply. The need to sometimes use part of your turn to refresh you supply is an excellent touch. It puts different strains on players and creates different potentials for players' turns.

The turn-order surprise is not ideal. Maybe a one tile lookahead would improve the game.

Lessons learned:
-Buying a market in a central location - either with a city tile or not - is a good thing. Buy 'em while they are cheap
-Fighting for oracles can be distracting. Much better to do what you need for the unassailable ones and don't get into a dogfight for the central ones.
-Road tiles get sparse toward the end. Save points so you have flexibility to use cities like roads.
-Don't be afraid to sell markets, especially if they are maxed out in terms of potential. Late in the game, the flexibility is costless on a maxed out city and the benefits are calculable - at least the downside. And the upside can be significant for placing another city or market.

OK I ADMIT IT! The board is rather unappealing to look at.  The 4 player colors could have been a little less 'dry' looking.  Since the game itself is kind of dry....maybe a bit more color would have been a good idea.

But what a pleasant surprise!  I may not always 'get' a game the first time through, but its rare that it really makes my brain hurt.  Magna Grecia really did that for me.  The economy is tight and I really like the way you have to sacrifice potential future increase to generate more money now.

Clinical, cold, piss-yellow Euro that has a few interesting mechanics slapped onto a basic connection game.  I went through a Colovini "phase" a few years ago and I really liked how this one played...these days, I don't think I could bear either the hideous graphics or the meaningless gameplay.

Got a chance to try this out. I had already played a 4 position solitare test game after which I was thoroughly impressed. The game against real opponents for some reason didn't go quite as well. I enjoyed it but for some reason the others weren't as impressed. Its not as much of a brain burner as I thought it would be. On the positive side I still think the game has some great tactical opportunities and requires some strategy as well. You can make the best short term tactical play every turn but still lose. My test games aren't helping me :)

After one play, I ended up beating two very good gamers (it was the first time for all of us) and I'm not sure how I did it.  There didn't seem to be a lot of interaction, and I just sat there and built cities and roads.  Whatever; I'd like to try it again and see if there was something I missed.

I've played this maybe half a dozen times,  and I LIKE it.  It's been a while since I've played a game this good.  I will be the first to admit that it's abstract and dry and it's got a hell of a learning curve.  BUT, considering the games that I tend to really LOVE (El Caballero anyone?), this shouldn't surprise anyone.  It reminds me of a variable-board version of Medieval Merchant...

RATING: 6
Headache inducing tile laying game.  Road and city tiles are played to the board, along with market cubes.  Players score points for lucrative markets and controlled oracles at the end of the game.  Markets are positioned into cities and are &quot;worth&quot; the number of cities connected to the market city.  Oracles are owned by the player who has a city connected to the oracle that has the most connections to other places - got that?!  Mechanics are elegant, strategy deep.  Interesting mechanic of spending VP&#039;s to deploy more cities, and cashing in markets for VP&#039;s before the game ends (for more cities and markets!).  Colour of the pieces and board causes the eyeballs to spin - it&#039;s all rather yellow.  I enjoyed it and thought it a good game, but it feels like a game that will sit on the shelf like other neglected gems (Tycoon, Loewenherz, etc).

Haven't fully made up my mind after two playings.  It doesn't set my world on fire, but I did find it very absorbing and the seemingly fiddly rules started to jell halfway through the first game so that I could start figuring out strategy.  It's still rather difficult to see at a glance how valuable a city is, but I think this might become easier with experience.  I like the feel of multiple shifting alliances, like Carcassonne, when you have a market in a city with other players' markets.  I also like the tension between placing tiles and taking the resupply action.  I think my rating could go up with more playings.  It's a shame the Rio Grande edition didn't fix the tile colors along with the board color; the examples in the rulebook look so much nicer than the actual game.

RATING: 3
[Schacht / Colovini] Yet another dry Colovini game. All info is public. Markets score points equal to the number of adjacent villages. Mathmatical optimization of the number of connections possible on a hex map. Clever play and opportunities for direct meddleing exist, but really, how many of these games can one play before their mind gets tired of the chore? Perfect information and crawling pace keep this one on my "only if forced to replay at gunpoint" list. Plus, the game does look like a vomit-filled swamp, but I digress.

I really want to like it, and the theme is a perfect fit, but after 4 plays I still can't even begin to wrap my brain around the strategy. I'm just not sure what I'm supposed to be doing on my turn... probably because I can't quite keep all the placement rules and restrictions straight yet. 

As others have pointed out, the color choices aren't the best. The brown cities are the same color as the neutral villages, and yellow roads are hard to see until you lean in close to the board. Still, I can live with the colors. What bugs me a bit more is the busy background texture. With different art, this game could have been stunning.

I'll keep trying to play and learn this one, but I get the feeling that it's slowly losing favor in my household... the strategies required are just too obtuse.

*update*  After a couple more plays, it finally started to click. I like it more than at first, but I still don't think it's quite my thing. I've enjoyed learning this one (struggle though it was) but I still doubt it will return for much table time. Relearning the strategies would be too much of a chore.

Played Magna Grecia for the first time on easter weekend 2009.

Played three games in a row. Magna Grecia is an interesting game with a good learning curve. 

You can play very badly and waste actions easily in Magna Grecia. Game is deeper in strategy than it looks. Game is a bit dry.

Abstract, but simple. Connect roads to cities. Make your cities bigger to maximum possible connection and using as little road tiles as possible.

Speaking of looks, the game itself is ugly. Board and tiles look about the same. Player's colors are almost all the same except for the red player. No help if you are colored blind.

I played badly and wasted a lot of my actions and yet, Magna Grecia failed to spark my enthusiasm. It has similarities to La Strada, which I really liked, but I struggled to grasp the point of Magna Grecia. The turn order randomises for no purpose but the board is fixed. The actions just didn't gel, I really could not get a feel for the game. It came down to calculating optimal moves and slowed down considerably. I'm quite prepared to give it another go, but I think it fails somewhere. The best opening seems to be to charge for the middle, slam down some markets then fight over the Oracles. Heyho. Next.

If the drab look of the components doesn't scare you away, there is a decent game to be found. It's rather dry and a bit mathy so it certainly isn't for everyone, but it's another fine example of how you can make a lot out of very little. The entire game consists of building roads and cities and buying and selling markets but where and when to do what is far from obvious. Keeping all the different building rules in mind can be a bit challenging at first, though.

Another Colovini title that just appeals to me.  Dry? yes it could be called that, but really this game is wet with decision making which far and beyond makes up for the pasted on theme.  Each turn is governed for all players, so it really comes down to who manages their game best as there in no luck here.  Lots of little rules make the learning curve high, meaning this game needs a few play throughs at one sitting for the placing/connecting/scoring rules to all absorb.  Once this is done however, Magna Grecia takes off and you have one of the better connection games out there,  I realize I gave credit to Colovini at first, as this feels more his design to me than Schact, but there is definetly a marriage here, and a good one at that.  Clever game that can leave the brain melting a bit.

UPDATE:  This game is a masterpiece.  Love it.  Route connection with a parasitic/symbiotic relationship between players actions.  The market place mechanic is great and tense.  Beautiful design.

The best big-box game I've seen from either Schacht or Colovini to date.  I've noticed a tendency for the game to bog down in spots while players calculate the number of connections running to their various cities and markets.  But I'm willing to tolerate the uneven pace because the game features such interesting choices on both strategic and tactical levels.  It's one of those gut-wrenching games where there are about five things you know you need to do immediately, but you can only achieve one or two.  A good game, but one that occupies an uncomfortable middle ground: it appeals most to the master strategists among us, yet those are the type of players who can sometimes impede the game with overanalysis.

RATING: 6
The start made me think the game was super, but that feeling faded away towards the end. Most of us ended up with many city tiles in the last 2 rounds, without being able to do anything important. Less analyses than expected. My expectations wasn't met at all.

Tough and very dry game with much analyis paralysis.  The look of the game doesn't help.

RATING: N/A
This one is for those who thought Java was the ultimate analysis-paralysis game. There's no hidden information in M.G. (everyone can even see what options are coming up next turn) and players can put their pieces down just about anywhere so long as they extend the existing network. At least Java has a good theme and a colorful board! Overall, interesting but not much fun.

Good connection game, simpler than it looks and marred by some difficulty in visualization (although I don't find it as bad as some people say). It's better with four players, as there is more competition for space and oracles, and too loose with just two.

The rulebook makes this game seem more confusing than it is. Relatively simple in concept, but quite complex in terms of analytical depth, number of options, and amount of look-ahead possible (this last is especially true with 2 players). I like it and get some satisfaction from it, but it feels more arduous than fun in my few plays so far.

RATING: 7.3
Jun08: Okay, it is dry, but so is TtD, and I love that game.  Magna Grecia (MG) is a very enjoyable experience to me.  I enjoy two main aspects of it:

1. The resource management.  Deciding when to replenish and when to sell markets is enjoyable to me.

2. The balance between markets and oracles seems pretty solid as well.  Gives some long term strategy.

The variable turn order is done very well with pretty much no "whose turn is it" due to the passing of the turn tile.  More games should use this mechanic.

I could imagine recounting the values of cities over and over could get old, but we used dice to mark the cities and it made it very easy actually.

I recommend MG if you are interested in a drier network game.  Trains in Athens should have been the name.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Headache inducing tile laying game. Road and city tiles are played to the board, along with market cubes. Players score points for lucrative markets and controlled oracles at the end of the game. Markets are positioned into cities and are "worth" the number of cities connected to the market city. Oracles are owned by the player who has a city connected to the oracle that has the most connections to other places - got that?! Mechanics are elegant, strategy deep. Interesting mechanic of spending VP's to deploy more cities, and cashing in markets for VP's before the game ends (for more cities and markets!). Colour of the pieces and board causes the eyeballs to spin - it's all rather yellow. I enjoyed it and thought it a good game, but it feels like a game that will sit on the shelf like other neglected gems (Tycoon, Loewenherz, etc).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played once with 3.   I think this game needs 4 players to really shine.  With 3 there was not any real contention for cities or even Oracles.  We each had our own area of the map and did not really grown into each other's roads and cities until the last 2 or 3 turns.

After playing a couple of times the game seems to get more and more tactical.  Because victory points are spent to build your network of roads and cities, the decision to cash in a market early can be a tough one to make.  My rating has actually gone up.  And it's co-designed by Leo Colovini and Michael Schacht... two of my favourite designers.

At first it felt like the game looked really ugly, but soon it began to feel like it is actually quite beautiful. You just need a proper lighting. Other than looks this is also a good game.

The game unfortunately suffers from a heavy AP especially in the end, but I think playing more could solve this problem.

A very basic connection game, but couple of BIG mistakes AND that's the reason why my rating is this low. Fairly easy to learn, but the biggest problem is that its almost impossible to see the overall situation (who is the leader etc.) and the same problem is there with the connections (who has the control of which Oracle). The game looks ugly too - althought not as ugly than Paris Paris is. We didn't had any problems of analysis-paralysis, but I can see, that it MIGHT be a problem, because all the information is visible. 
Summa summarum: nothing special or unique here and there are better games available on this category. A little bit too long (and boring) for my taste.

I wasn't overly stupified by this game.  I was going to give it a 5, but I thought it did have an interesting mechanic with the cards and how the turns worked out.  Board is just WAY too busy.  I know it has been said before, so I will not say much about it except colors.  Also, having no clue who is winning until the points are counted up isn't high on my list of things I like.  Granted, you have an "idea" of who might be winning, but really no clue unless it is painfully obvious.  I'd play again, but there are other games I'd prefer to play.  Just my preference.

An intense and abstract game, which normally would deter me, since the sit-around-the-gameboard-in-utter-silence family of games (exemplified for me by Java) is not my cup of tea. Magna Grecia, however, is so good and full of fresh ideas that I&#039;d rate it an 8 or higher if it were not for the horrible, horrible design, which manages to be ugly as sin AND unfunctional at the same time. Sad.

First impression: 8

It has a steep learning curve until the point where you begin to enjoy the mechanics. But the game is pretty elegant and allows a lot of deep competitive strategic play. On a side note is much better to play it with four players, three is ok, two not so.

If you are looking for light easy to learn mechanics, this is not the game for you. Probably not too friendly with non-gamers. Anyway I would recommend it if you enjoy deep strategy.

---------------------------------------------------------

Update: 6.5 

After another play, and having played other games, I decided to lower the rating from 8 (definitely too high) to 6.5. I think there are some obscure and not totally explained rules (like selling a market and then merging a city to count twice the points), that just doesn't feel right. And additionally the game is highly prone to Analysis Paralisis.

Anyway I will play again, and maybe I will change my current rating.

Update: played it again after many years. It is still a very good game with a unique scoring system. It is a railroad game in disguise, in a very good way. Passing the action card around to the active player is not a very smooth mechanism, it is delaying, but the game itself makes up for that. The looks of the game: enough has been said about that. You get used to it while playing, the game is interesting enough to forget about the bad graphics with too little contrast, "everybody playing with yellow" etc. The game is well worth checking out, it definitely remains in my collection.

A pretty competitive and somewhat difficult control game (you don't want to get too far behind) where players are building markets which are worth the value of the number of routes, connected to cities, which are connected to it.  A good player can forsee which areas are going to be hot commodities.  Players are also vying for control of the Oracles which one gains by connecting to the Oracle from a controlled city that has the most markets connected to it.  Something like that... I may have the cities & markets mixed around.

Magna Grecia is frequently mentioned among Colovini's best titles (and among the ugliest boards ever made).

In ancient Italy, build cities and roads. Object of the game is to place markets on villages or cites. The trick is that the price of the market goes up if the village is occupied with markets of your opponents.  Oracles in the game allow one to link up to them; majority of links allow one to earn money. Only played once in August 2003, seemed like a decent game.

Somewhat dry, but a very engaging connection game nonetheless. The key element is to predict which city will be the concentrated "hub" of the city network. The cost of market building is lower if you get in the city earlier, so the prediction part becomes critical. All the more critical because you have limited resource(which does not increase during the game at all) to build them. Scoring and initial strategies are not so intuitive, but once you get it this game is a solid strategy game.

RATING: 8
First impression: There is just right tension between between being able to do all the things you want. There isn't too much money (points) to spend on all city/market placements you'd like to and therefore you must do some early scorings to get more during the game. Also supply of road/city pieces must be filled eventually but what is right time for it? You can do strategic planning but you also must react and adapt to opponents moves at least as much. I like this combination very much. Definitely want to play again when possible. With 4 players there was times when you have to wait for 6 turns before you get your turn back to you and that feels quite a long time as a lot gets going on map before you get your turn again. That being one of the reasons, I think the game might be best experience with 3 players. Still, it felt a very good game with 4 players.

RATING: 6
A dry, abstract connection game with no hidden information. Has some clever mechanisms but left a pretty bland impression anyway. Prone to heavy AP when played with overanalyzers but plays fast with the right group.

Seriously oversized box, with non-standard dimensions: The box size is somewhere between Power Grid and Tikal, meaning it does not match any of the hundreds of other game boxes in my entire collection.

Magna Grecia ha secondo me una grafica poco invitante e dei colori deprimenti, i giocatori posso scegliere tra giallo, arancio, marroncino e rosso. A parte questo non Ã¨ male, Ã¨ un gioco di piazzamento, si scelgono 2 tra le 3 azioni a disposizione e si continua cosÃ¬. Ho il sospetto che con pensatori troppo fini il gioco rischi di allungarsi molto. Decisamente un gioco astratto che ricorda piÃ¹ un ferroviario rispetto all'ambientazione dettata dal titolo.

Not quite sure about his game. Quite abstract, but we'll need to play this some more and get into the subtle strategies before I am sold. Definitely wins award for ugliest game I've played so far. They could have used better piece colors - who decided on red, yellow, brown and orange?!?

It's a cross between Durch Die Wuste (tile placements in multiple locations over the board, with that feeling that you want to play in 5 places at once each turn), Carcassonne (do I play for city / market points that I can score through the game, or for Oracle / farmer points that score 4 points each at end-game only) and El Grande (managing your flow of roads and cities from the provinces to your court to the board). As I rate all of these games a 9, you can see that Magna Grecia is a likely winner for a gamer like myself.

You have to pace your development through the game - you get 15 vp's (in a 4p game) to build cities and markets and these go much faster than you'd like, at which point you may need to start selling markets back before they've hit their max score potential to get the vp's you need to build more things. Some turns are quick. As the game progresses, you're more likely to suffer analysis paralysis, which is the one downside to the game.

RATING: 7
This connection game seems far more difficult from the rules than it actually plays.  Players are trying to create cities that are connected to the most other things, and score one point per connection.  You're also trying to connect oracles; the city with the most connections that's adjacent to an oracle will get a bonus four points.  There's a bunch of fiddly rules about getting in on someone else's city, building more than one market (which is the part of the city that scores) per turn, etc.  But as difficult as the rules try to make it, it's not that hard really.  It's a fun little connection game, but make sure you understand how things score before you play, or else you'll probably just end up doing random things.

First play with 4 and there was so much confusion. Not only did the lack of strong, defining colours make assessment difficult, but also the alternating rules regarding road and city placements was too much for my little brain. Added to that was the concept of temple ownership, highlighting the problem of weak road colours:as the game progressed it was like looking at a large plate of spaghetti. I even had trouble trying to  implement the tactic of spending effectively to make more money/victory points, though I gradually picked up the tactic of placing markets for free whenever possible.  Tactical road placement reminded me of Durch die Wuste (which despite pastel colours is far less confusing). Like Puerto Rico there is minimum luck, with only the action map tiles flipped in each round providing much needed spice in a rather dull and humourless exercise in who can think more clearly on the night.

First impression of a two player game: Nothing exciting there. The rules are hard to read. The material is barely O.K. At two, the board is to wide and there is not enough interaction between players. With more than two players this game must be a brain burner that can lead to analysis paralysis. It feels like Tigris and Euphrat but less fun. I don't know if I'll keep it. Will surely be better with 3 or 4 players.

PremiÃ¨re impression d'une partie Ã  deux. Rien de particuliÃ¨rement excitant.
Les rÃ¨gles sont pÃ©nibles Ã  lire. Le matÃ©riel est correcte sans plus. Ã€ deux, le plateau est trop vaste ce qui fait qu'il n'y a pas assez d'interactions entre les joueurs. Ã€ plus de deux joueurs, ce jeu doit Ãªtre un vrai casse tÃªte qui doit mener Ã  de sÃ©rieuses paralysies analytiques. Ressemble lÃ©gÃ¨rement Ã  Tigris et Euphrate en moins plaisant. Je ne sais pas si je vais le garder.
Sera surement meilleur Ã  deux ou trois joueurs.

RATING: 3
UPDATE: Downgrade from 7 to 3! My love of connection games clouded my judgment for this game!

This game is dry dry dry due to a huge lack of tension. Your classic connection game involves settling small battles all over the board, then joining up all those battles together. Restrictions on building do not promote this kind of play. Most of the game involves expanding your little area of the map.

Another lack of tension comes from the very opaque scoring. It's too bothersome to calculate who's in the lead.

Someone in my playing group mentioned that you don't do enough on your turn to merit the potentially large amounts of downtime between turns. I blame this on the requirement to resupply yourself with new tiles, and action cards that dictate how many tiles you may place/resupply, which during the game will be abysmally low. So the tension of resource depletion is not coming from players but from a deck of cards -- luck instead of player interaction dominates in this case.

=====

The rules are so difficult to explain! And remember!

Very, very dry game, probably because during your turn your opponents have nothing to do but watch you ponder. That said, turns should go by quickly -- with experienced players. For beginners, game play is slow because of the quite original, yet quite opaque way, you gain points.

It's also dry because player interaction and competition is very subtle. There are two main ways to score points. The most important one is scoring oracles: You look at the cities connected (via a road) to an oracle. Whichever city is directly connected to the most cities/villages scores for the oracle. So in this competition, players are either adding connections to their own cities, or trying to block off the expansion of opponents' cities -- but this second option is typically not possible.

Another source of dryness: Players have their own supply of road tiles and city tiles. However, players cannot directly splurge on these supplies. They have to spend part of their turn to take a limited number from this supply, which players may then use on later turns. This "hindrance" mechanism, although adding a strategic layer, slows the game down -- resupplying is simply not as exciting as building roads/cities.

Criticisms aside, this is one of the most elegant multi-player connections games I know of, with one of the most original scoring mechanisms.

A connection game combined with an investment economic game. It works well and provides an interesting challenge. It has some second-guessing of which cities are going to grow and so should be invested in, as well as positional fighting to either keep others out of your lucrative markets or gain control of oracles. These things make it a fairly deep and challenging game, but as none of the play is very intuitive it doesn't fit well into the "play-once-every-two-years" mould. Played without laggards it goes very fast, and complaints about the colours are a little over-blown. Rating could rise if I played it more often.

--Nov2007-- More than 3 years after buying, I finally take it out for a spin.  The mechanics and scoring are both surprisingly accessible once the game has begun - particularly given how little I thought I understood the cost and objective functions after reading the rules.  It's quite intriguing, and I'd love to play again against more competent opponents!
--Aug2012-- Ok; it took a while.  This is really quite lovely.  Though I need to work on explaining it.

RATING: 4
I have never been so lost on the first playing of a game as I was on this one. There is a lot to learn. It's a challenging game. It's a thinking game. Not as richly themed or fun as Java. Finally, and importantly, the colours used in the game suck big time. It is hard to see your roads if you're playing anything other than red. It easily loses a rating point because of this. I can only hope the next printing sees a colour combo revision.

Not as long as a real game, not as light as a filler.  The game falls in this hard category to rate.  Nevertheless, it can be said for sure that it is a nice quick brain burner connection game with a lot of player interaction and very clever mechanics.  It can be compared with [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9675]La Strada[/url][/i], which has a similar look and I bet provides similar feelings.

[1 play] I had a hard time getting my head around this game in the first play. I think I'll like it better the second time and my rating will go up. That said, it is a train/connection game - or could easily be re-themed to be one - so take that into consideration depending how you feel about those.

I like the game clock, the changing player order, and the combative route blocking aspects. The board graphics and player color choices aren't helping to sell anyone on this game, though. It's an ugly duckling.

A rather abstract strategy game that has two key flaws. First, it has poorly designed components, particularly the board which is very unpleasant to look at. Second, the "ancient colonies" theme doesn't match the economic merging and train mechanics. It's not a terrible game by any means, but it doesn't quite make the cut for me.

This rating is after an initial short (8 turn) game.  I really liked it and I wouldn't be surprised if I like it more after I play the longer (12 turn) game.  Abstract, but not as much as Colovini and Schacht's other designs (which I tend to like, anyway).  On the other side of the coin, it's more fiddly than most (all?) of their other designs.  I had absolutely no problem with the colors of the Rio Grande version...in fact, I quite liked the color scheme.

Man is this game ugly.  I mean really, it looks like someone threw up on the board.  Not just vomit, but that weird fake vomit.  Something that intentionally looks like vomit.  

That said it sure don't stink.  There are so many tough, jucy decisions to make here.  I like to think of this game being a viral stock game.  You want to spread out and infect areas and work your way into other people's systems.  Really this is a lovely system.  

Sadly, the scoring system is tough to wrap your head around, making this a poor game to play with newbies, drunk or tired players. I also wouldn't recommend inviting a serial killer into your home to play this.  

Some people say it is dry and/or a brain burner, I'm not really getting that vibe, but to each their own.

Hmmm. Everything works here, but like many Colovini games, this one is exceptionally dry and abstract. It's also lacking in any sort of fun factor - it's all just cold calculation.

Solid game. The colours are annoying, analysis paralysis, poorly written rules are its three flaws, two of which are easily fixed. The game cries out for a comprehensive easy to understand player aid detailing where, cities, roads and markets can be placed and what they cost. The paralysis problem can be solved with a simple game timer. The colours...well hopefully in the next printing they make them bolder. The scoring is much easier when you realize that "Markets score only when they can connect DIRECTLY (via ANY colour of road) back to a CITY of their OWN colour". Simple eh?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I just played a 3p short game and intend to give it another try, but first impression is not good. It's a game of building roads, cities, and markets within your and others' cities, and scoring primarily due presence in cities that have the most direct connections to other places.

It plays smoothly, little downtime between turns.

But it lacks tension. I think it's caused by a mix of things: Map is too large, too many viable options (wherever people are building is where it's going to be most lucrative), and too much randomness preventing any planning. (Every round the limits to each type of action are drawn from a deck.)

Deep, promising game that gets more than a little lost in the details.  About the most cumbersome scoring of any game I've ever played, it was nevertheless interesting trying to suss out how moves would affect the final score.

A fine game, but too murky.

Tough game. Rating keeps going up. Have finally found my stride in this one, and have started winning. You MUST get others to connect to your cities. It is dry and calculating and very good.

purchased 060305 After two plays have only just started to scratch the surface to the subtleties to this game, which is perhaps why it is a bit of a sleeper this game. It's very strategic, a little bit hard to get your head around some of the more fiddly rules, AND it's really only for gamers. ok, ok the game is ugly, almost Capitol in it's ugliness, but the game angst is there! The sort of game where you need to get 3 or so games in quick succession to get the rules down, but once you do, there's a game  here that's worth it's weight in $$$. UPDATE: board is ugly, rules are a little unclear..lose a point

The "look what's coming" mechanic of divining future actions is nothing that I've seen before, and I lose at least 40,000 brain cells (toasted) every time that I play.

Really, the whole network/market system is rather unique.

One of the very best games ever for ratio of depth to playing time (under 60 minutes).  You need to play this one a bit and download a play aid to get there.

Wow wow wow.  How many times do you play a game, get completely smoked, then immediately want to play it again?  First play was awful for me...and I saw three different strategies I could try next time.  I can't wait for my next playing.  The best of Schacht and Colvini wrapped into a single game!

Play twice so far and I thoroughly enjoyed both plays.  Looking forward to getting this on the table with more people.

Don't even try to explain this totally abstract game â€” just play it and score it.  It's actually pretty simple, and is interesting, challenging fun!

Crokinole with a higher skill requirement.  I really like it, though the games definitely take much longer.  As flicking games go, this is 18xx to TtR.  Both take great skill to play, one just seems more monumental.

I got the Carrom board as a present, but without a manual or any information how to play. Therefore it was stored unplayed for a long time. Then I learned on BGG about Crokinole and saw that Carrom looks similar. I bought a book about Carrom, repaired the board (see some pictures in my gallery) bought new playing stones and special sliding powder. This changed a lot!
I started some training but had to realize that Carrom is not easy to master and it needs a lot of practice to be able to realize controlled shoots.
Finally I decided to buy a Crokinole board, model Wintersonne [url=crokinole.de]Crokinole.de[/url], which is much easier to play even with people who play it for the first time.
With Carrom there is no way to play without serious prcatice. With Crokinole you can enjoy playing right from the start on (but practise will help also for Crokinole...).

\_______GER_______/
Habe das Spiel vor vielen Jahren geschenkt bekommen (keiner wusste was das eigentlich sein sollte, aber es sah irgendwie interessant und vor allem groß aus und auch viel zu Schade um es einfach zu verschrotten; das dachten sich wohl auch die Schenker :-)).
Nach einem ersten erfolglosen Anlauf blieb das Brett dann viele Jahre hinter einem Schrank verstaut. 
Durch die sehr guten Beurteilungen auf BGG von Crokinole habe ich das Carrombrett jetzt wieder belebt:
Neue (Tunier-)Steine gekauft (Philos), die kaputten Auffangsäckchen erneuert, 7cm hohe Gummifüßchen unter das Brett montiert und synthetisches (Plastik?) Gleitpulver (Mespi 100g) gekauft. Jetzt flitzen die Steine über das Brett wie auf einem Luftkissen!
Mit dem Buch (Carrom - Regeln und Training, Uwe Petersen, Verlag Hugenbubel) und [url=http://www.carrombasics.com/]Carrom Tips[/url] aus dem Internet sind die Regeln jetzt deutlich geworden und mit den Schussübungen erreicht man doch schnell eine spürbare Verbesserung bei den Schussergebnissen (aus den anfänglich nur Zufallsschüssen werden langsam gezielte Schüsse dnen aber eine Portion Zufall noch anhängt).
Habe mir jetz auch Crokinole (das Model Wintersonne bei [url=crokinole.de]Crokinole.de[/url] gekauft)und muss gestehen das Crokinole viel direkter zugänglich ist und wahrscheinlich auch viel mehr gespielt werden wir. Aber trotzdem hat Carrom seinen eigenen Charme. Ich werde versuchen auch Carrom weiter zu entwickeln.

crokinole is for playing with anyone enywhere, a fun game you can always take out and be sure of it being a hit.

carrom is a lifestyle game. it won't always be a hit, but if you want to get serious about a dexteriety game, this beats crokinole, or any other dexteriety game I know for that matter, hands down.

crokinole is for gamers, carrom is for carrom-players. much like go or chess isn't for gamers when many abstract strategies are...

both have their uses, so I'm not going to call one better (for now at least).  

edit: ok, so carrom on a pro table is certainly better than crokinole on a selfmade one.

edit2: after getting into carrom I really feel no need to play more crokinole again. it seems so 1 dimensional now...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good flicking game that looks great hung on the wall... can bog down a bit if pieces get stuck in tricky places... at its best with 4 I think. Worth tracking down some proper Carrom powder.

Would prefer a nice Crokinole set but difficult to find / expensive in the UK.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a sport. This is nothing like Crokinole - it's much harder to start playing well and you can play for many years and still learn the game. The better player will usually win. If you don't want to spend many hours playing this I would not recommend buying the game.

+ a game you might want to play all your life and get better and better at it
+ you see your skill growing
+ depending on your time and mood you can play a full game or only one break
+ good with 2 and 4 players. Also fun to practice by yourself

Interesting dexterity game.  Fun to play.  I like the various rules sets - it allows choice and good ways to play for different numbers of people.

Update:  A thoroughly excellent dexterity game.  Frustrating to begin with as your shots can be wildly inaccurate, but as you play more you become more accurate.  The game really shines as a two-player game in my view, with plenty of skill and tactics involved.  Is just as difficult to master asd regular pool, with just as many satisfying moments when you manage to snag that rebound shot, or the gentle angle shot, or move a nearly hidden piece without distrubing the opponents  - a great game.  My favourite dexterity game.

I guess the comparisons to pool are pretty strong.  I've heard many people prefer this to Crokinole, but I just don't see it. Its a fun game, but I find Crokinole a bit more compelling.

I prefer crockinole, because it is easier to achieve acceptable skill levell.

This game is hard to play same as pool, so..
1. you need to spend a lot of time on practice, to play with satisfaction
2. then you will have problems with finding an opponents on your skill level

But if you need a game not for occasional plays, then this one is a good choice.

I played (by finger-flicking Crokinole pieces) Carrom often as a kid-- my parents as well as my grandmother had this game.  I always have thought that Carrom (on the flip side of the Crokinole board) required more skill and was a better game than Crokinole.  

For ease of game play, the Carrom gameboard needs to be placed on a turn-stand, allowing the variant (and even better Carrom game) play in which the the shooter must be flicked from where it rests from the previous shot. One of the old official rule books even has, on its back cover, an ad for such a customized turn-stand, price $3.

My first dexterity game - I got this way before I was interested in boardgames.  There is a basic amount of skill needed to prevent the game going on for far too long, much like snooker for instance, but a timely concession never goes amiss.  As you get better, more advanced rules are available which makes this game appeal to all types.

I made my own maze-style board in 7th grade. It had ramps to jump walls, zones where further actions were required if you landed in them, and a final target of a just-barely-big-enough pocket (inspired by golf carrom). This massive project irritated my shop teacher so much that I was banned from making anything but doorstops for him for the rest of the year. I loved that thing.

This is a delightful game, even despite the low quality of the amateur board I own. It got me interested from the first flick, but I can see yet even bigger potential in this game, as there are many techniques to be mastered and experience to be gained to fully appreciate Carrom.

This is a seriously underrated game.

This game is underrated in BGG.  I prefer Carrom to Crokinole (I own both).  Also official (Indian/Asian) Carrom and American Carrom are mixed up here.  To me American Carrom, which has huge pockets and usually comes with many more classic games (e.g. chess, checker, backgammon, etc.), should be clearly distinguished from official Carrom.  Official Carrom has International rule set and regulations for equipments and is widely played throughout the world (especially in Asia).  Game itself is a finger flicking billiard.  It requires tons of practice for accurate shots.  Maybe its learning curve is bringing the rating down.  But this game grows slowly in you.  When you start feeling comfortable pocketing your carrom men (disks), you get addicted to it guaranteed.

It's not that Carrom is bad, it is that it has a steep learning curve. (Which is probably why it rates so much lower than Crokinole on BGG.) And since you are only likely to play it against someone who is much better than you (because why else are they going to have a carrom board available?), your first dozen games are likely to be fairly un-fun occasions.

It's a bit like pool but felt more inaccessible. If you play pool consistently you will get better. But not everyone is going to want to play pool enough to Get Good At It. I didn't see myself wanting to play carrom enough to put in the necessary practice to become half decent.

If you like Crokinole you will like this game. A game of pool using crokinole pieces. A better game if you get a really good playing board (don't cheap out). Unfortunately you'll need a place to store this big board.

RATING: 8
I know if I ever get to play on a "professional" or just a good decent board, Crokinole will lose a LOT of its appeal...

Oh and why do I never see anyone playing the Striker where it comes to a rest?  Talk about a more strategic and difficult game rather than picking it up everytime and getting to place it on a whole line?  HELLO Houserule, I mean if you like Billards at all that is a no brainer. Maybe its too hard but I don't think so, will find out soon as a nice new board is on the way :) 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] While Good ole' Crok is a fun game, Carrom on a proper board is the better game. More skillful and more to consider on your shots, weight has to be taken more in account most times too. 

I tried playing where the Striker comes to rest and it was good, not as good as I thought for some reason. Maybe I am just not good enough to play that way yet!  

Basically this is just like playing pool/billards but with your finger, excellent game but if you buy a board, try to be sure to either get a cheap one OR a straight one. I looked at about 15 different boards all from India and NONE were straight (they were all cheap though).  Stick to Synco I think from what I seen so far, better quality overall.

Unfortunately I have to rank this only a 6 mostly due to the fact that my Carrom board sucks and the gameplay is slow.  I'm used to the fast action of my good crokinole board. If I had a faster board the rating could easily go higher but as it stands I don't much want to play this game.

Picked up a used Synco board of good quality. The game is most similar to pool, but with pieces that slide as easily as air hockey. I find this game to be pretty amazing. I've only played with my son so far, neither of us very skilled, but we're having a really good time trying out the different ways to flick, finding out which angles seem most effective, discovering ways to block - there really is not only a fair bit of skill required, but also more strategic considerations than in any flicking game I've ever played (well, considerations very similar to pool, actually). I'm not that much of a fan of pool, but I respect it, and I'm not sure exactly why this gives me so much more pleasure. I think I'm just not a big fan of cues.

I expect to continue playing this for a long time to come! I have yet to play Crokinole, but this increases my excitement to try that one as well.

Entry level full sized (huge) board bought because i couldn't afford crokinole and thought this would be better value. I upgraded the Men but boy is this tricky. Lots of practice is definitely a must to make this game more enjoyable since it is just too difficult at first which makes the first games very long.

But worth buying - as skillful as snooker?

Played on "pro" boards at Origins game convention in Columbus, Ohio.  I love the game, but I think it has a much harder learning curve compared to Crokinole.  Also, it's messy with the powder and can go on forever with two or more unskilled players.  I still love it, but I can't see preferring it to Crokinole.

I am the Minnesota Fats of Wandsworth.  Carrom in my opinion stands apart from its peers due to the variety of shots, awareness of angles and control needed over your striker (your cue ball in either pool or snooker).  Often compared to Crockinole I would choose Carrom 9 times out of 10 because it offers a greater challenge, is a more sophisticated game (Carrom is the father of Pool and Snooker while Crockinole appears to be closer to marbles in my opinion) and rewards practice (this is not a game you can play half-heartedly). The only exception when I would choose Crockinole, the easier game, is when the group demands a more accesible game and that your friends have a variety of aptitudes for dexterity games.

I am yet to find a boardgame, since Subbuteo, which requires such precision of touch or speed and awareness of angles.  A great game - perfect for a lads night in and a bet on the winner.

If you are London based it is well worth a trip to Spittalfields Market to test the game out at the Carrom stall in the far corner.

Skill based game. Suited for competitive play. This game was very attractive because it's like pool/snooker, but so small it's easy to bring into you're home. After more than a dozen plays, every game ended with a mild frustration, because consistent aiming is pretty difficult with a finger-flick. Since i have far more played pool/snooker it would be unfair to say it's easier in the beginning, but this game is definitely challenging to play and i believe demands lots of love for it, time, practice and patience to develop enough hand-skills to make it fun. i think new players will always struggle and be frustrated at first. Skilled players will enjoy this game.

I've always liked Snooker, but the skill required, plus the need to go to a club to play it, means that I've never really had the opportunity to be good at it. This can be played at home, is portable and, though discs rather than balls, gives me the same buzz.

My only quibble is that I quite like the play-where-it-lays style of Snooker and Pool, and prefer it to the baseline method of Carrom, but it's still an enjoyable game.

May not be right for everyone due to high difficulty on a real board. 
I have a real board, but I prefer playing on my cheap "American Carrom" board--it enhances the strategic element by reducing the potentially harsh physical demands of "real" Carrom.
I personally can clear a full Carrom board in under two minutes, but everyone I have or will likely play with would really benefit from simplified fun of an American Carrom board.
In any case, Crokinole is just more fun than either of these.

This game is a little like billiards in that you're trying to sink your pieces into pockets on the corners of the board.  That said, instead of hitting balls with long sticks, you're flicking discs with your fingers.  This just isn't my style of game; I'm not good at it, it hurts my fingers, and I don't find it a lot of fun.

A great dexterity game. Like pool, billards, it's about physics and correct striker placement.

There are options galore (including defensive moves where you put opponents seeds behind his line). I've seen many wonderful shots executed by skilful players and it's not an easy game to master.

There's a 'competition' level board where the pockets are recessed (not unlike a billiard table) and increases the difficulty!

I love the game!

There is nothing wrong with the game, but I just don't think it rewards new players.  This is one of those classic games where it is only fun if two highly skilled players are up against each other.  It isn't easy to pick up at all.  Most of the game is spent giving the puck to each other as no one can sink anything.  Most of what you sink ends up being flukish, and to make matters worse, you give up pieces if you scratch.  

Perhaps the end game is the most absurd, as you have to sink red before you can sink one of your own.  Right, I'm lucky if I can get one in.

It ain't no Elchfest.

For those willing to invest the money for a good board, and to invest the time to get beyond the basics, this game (national pasttime of India) can be every bit as engaging and deep as billiards.  Often compared to Crokinole, I find this to be a vastly deeper and more rewarding game. The one 'down side': like billiards there is a certain learning curve before the game becomes truly enjoyable. Unfortunately,  I can't get my wife to invest the time to climb that curve.  So I regrettably sold this great game.

Another flicking game. I played this a bunch as a kid, but none really since then. Unlike Crokinole, you use a striker to hit the targets. The rules are also slightly more complicated than Crokinole, although it's still fairly straightforward. 

We may end up getting this, although it's another big game that'll be hard to store and rarely come out to be played!

Carrom requires enough skill that it can be difficult for beginners to make any headway, and their games will take a long time to complete. They will be entertained nonetheless.

I'd like to get a good set of this today.  It's not nearly as good as Crokinole, but most people won't care.

Singapore Bus Services, in whose offices I used to work, would run tournaments for the bus drivers and office staff.  I never competed, but I used to spare with one of the secretaries who came close to winning the tournament.

Used to have a carrom board. It is loads of fun and requires skills. I still have fond memories of playing carrom with my uncles and my brother.

I played the American version a lot of this as a kid, with cheap plastic rings.  

I've played the new international version once at Gencon (for about 2 hours).  It is  far superior.

Flicking tiles; fun with little kids but the fingernails get sore. Maybe I don't have a proper flicking technique?

= « Crokinole » : autre jeu de "pichenottes" où chaque équipe doit envoyer ses rondelles au plus près de l’espace central du plateau.

The rules make it a very hard game to play (Relaxed rules would be more fun).  Much practice required to play well.  Not much of a game compared to crokinole.

Great great dexterity game. There is some mild strategy to this as well, such as blocking opponent pieces and such. With a nice cup of masala chai, this makes for a great Sunday afternoon.

Want to find a small board with a nice design. The ones at the Oxfam shops seem a bit plain.

Seems to be too much like pool, but with finger-flicking -- not unique enough to own.

Get ready for your flicking finger to hurt for up to two days later! That being said, physics is fun!

The carrom game is a lot like pool. Flick (or use a cue) one piece into another. I grew up with American Carrom which has multiple games associated with it.

An easy to learn dexterity game. Children would probably enjoy this game. Reasonably cheap and does not require a good board for fun play. Just add lots of powder!

Every Swedish child of my generation played Carrom in school. It's a fun game.

Fun dexterity game, for when you don't have room for a pool table.

RATING: 6
Challenging, but like billiards, it can drag on theoretically forever.  Unlike billiards, you don't have a cue stick to aim accurately, so you need to have serious flick-fu.  Fun, but you definitely benefit from practice (as with [gameid=403]).

I don't play regularly enough to properly develop the skill.

Nice finger-flicking game. Requires quite some skill to make good shots. Check out www.carrombasics.com (in german) for flash tutorials.

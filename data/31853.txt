A very enjoyable logic puzzle. Only fun as the human, though.

RATING: 8
I have come to judge [gameid=165] as one of the classic pillars of the competitive puzzle game genre, and for years I thought it would be one of those classic out-of-print designs that would outlast serious challenges from the rear. Well, never underestimate the strength of rejuvenated direct lineage.

A while back I stumbled into the online hexagonal version, by the creator himself, and it became a thorn in my side. I liked it far better, so much so, that the original grid-based one instantly lost some of its sheen. Worse, it was only available online, and I am far less of a DIYer than I'd like to be.

Of all the releases announced for Essen 2007, this was the one surprise that immediately caught my attention, and it was my first pre-order. And still with no regrets.

Is this the perfect incarnation? No, but close.

Firstly, the bijou old Waddingtons version with its heavy metal balls and raised board is as travel and shock proof as it comes. The much larger mat of its sibling, with chuncky wooden pieces is pleasingly functional. On a spacious table. It has failed to sit comfortably on two café tables we have played it on, with cake and cups ending precariously close to the table edges. For a pen-and-pencil game that can be played comfortably on a quarter of the board, its XL presentation  is a bit over the top. At home, the more generous presentation will work a treat, but it is just not where we play this type of 2-player game most. 
 
I am baffled that there are only 6 atoms to hide. I guess it is to stop people falling into that other trap, creating a set-up in which atoms are shielded by other atoms in such a way that their correct position can never be established.

But fewer atoms also means that a lucky guesser can unlock the puzzle you carefully crafted, simply by sending in the golden bullet beam first. It might be my perception only, rather than actual play, but I have the impression that the difference between a stomper of a puzzle, and a doddle, is largely dependant on those early lucky rays that set the scene, more so than in the original. Maybe it's a combination of the hexagonal shape and that there are just those 6 atoms to hide. Enough to create a puzzle from one or two angles, but never enough to leave tell-tale flags exposed. And a lucky first guess can unravel the entire challenge set, simply by approaching the exposed flank first.

Somehow, in the online puzzle generator, which allows you hide up to 8 atoms, this happens far less when you have to find more of them. Having to crack the tricky reflections is what makes this a fun challenge, and a busier arena seems to generate just that with far more regularity. There is a flip-point though. Too many atoms and scores will just about even out, as players will need to use roughly the same amount of rays regardless of the actual placement. The designer's sweet spot is given as 6, but I prefer it between 6 and 7 atoms, and not getting a 7th one, even an 8th one, in a Spartan game with few components that wasn't the cheapest, it is a bit on the lean side.

Still, a treat, and one we enjoy tremendously. Ricochet Robots managed to overcome the limitations that usually come with a 2-player puzzle, by making all players simultaneous code-breakers, and doing away with the code-setter role completely.   If it wasn't for that game, Black Box   would probably be my ideal ray-puzzler. Now it is 'simply' a great one. And a more relaxing, as you are not going head to head simultaneously with players who might well be faster thinkers than you. 

In the original, a lot was made of the 'drawback' that certain configurations can 'hide' atoms from prying rays. It is usually suggested that players agree to avoid this when creating their opponent's task. We have come up with a different solution that hopefully avoids the arguments if one task still slips through. If the task-setter can't conjure up a single ray that disproves the suggested final solution, the solver can take 10 points of their score. It still discourages players to create such a set-up, and rewards a player who no doubt has been sending in extra rays to figure out the impossible. It doesn't invalidate their hard work if the task-setter has goofed. If you happen to guess the "alternative" that was actually set by the creator, no bonus is given.

Unique puzzle/abstract game, that I can only describe as a cross somewhere between classic Battleship and Mastermind. It's definitely not without it's problems- multiple solutions are possible sometimes leading to hypothetically correct guesses which in fact are wrong. The scoring system is also a little goofy when it comes to mistakes the "setter" makes in describing the movement of the rays. Can you purposely give wrong answers to throw the experimenter off or was this added as a way to resolve botched games? I hope the prior, because the latter is definitely not my sort of thing. Especially in combination with the first problem listed. 

I sort of worry about the replayibility of this game, but I think I will keep it around for it's unique concept and play and maybe to show my kids/nieces/nephews someday.

I like black box and the hexagonal board only make it more attractive to me. I just wish they had some reusable, laminated card like in the MB version, instead of the paper ones they have here.

By the time I knew of this new edition of Black Box, it was already out of print and hard to find.  :(

Complete and only slightly played ( a couple of the sheets on the pad used)

Loads of wooden bits and a double sided board, all complete and very nice.

The hexagon grid is a bit mind-bendy, in a good way.  However, the only way to make this really a game, though, is to play face to face, taking turns being the master, and comparing how long it takes to solve each other's grids.  Otherwise, it's just a puzzle.

A very good game that always stretches the mind when playing. Add to the fact that there are two different boards and ways of playing and this one is a two player winner.

Years ago I played Black Box by the hours. I was so excited when I discovered there was an advanced game, Black Box +, and searched for it a long time before I found it.

When I first opened it I was disappointed. My original, square Black Box was a solid, molded plastic box with a top that kept all the pieces inside. It had a definite air of mystery about it.  This new Black Box +, comes in the normal cardboard box with a cardboard game board, That is rather dull looking. The board is reversible; Black Box on one side, Black Box +, on the other.  Despite my initial disappointment with the board, the pieces are an improvement. My original markers were thin, orange, plastic and easy to loose or break, and the "atoms", yellow marbles. The markers now quality--beautifully painted, colorful, large wooden pieces and the atoms are large, red, domes. 

Both are 2-player puzzle games of pure logic and deduction somewhat similar to Battleship. (In Battleship 5 ships are secretly placed and players take turns shooting, only to be told when hits are made) Black Box is a square grid, Black Box +, is hexagonal. In both games 4-6 atoms are secretly placed by the Setter, forming a molecule. The Seeker, shoots imaginary rays into the grid (box) and depending upon what happens to the ray, he deduces the shape of the molecule. The Setter tells the Seeker whether the ray was absorbed, or the point of exit. The ray exits either in a straight line, by reflection, or by deflection. The Black Box has only 90° angles of deflection, while the Black Box + adds 60° and 120° angles.

I loved it then, I love it now. The hexagon is more challenging. And two games in one box, very nice.  Definitely one of my favorite 2-player games.

Facinating deduction game - like a Mastermind extreme! Very enjoyable and a challenging. I've played only the square-side (the easier one) of Black Box and tried couple of hexagon side solos as well. Nice game when you find other player which likes this genre games as well.

OK,, so we have the original game, which we like, plus a hex variant.  What this loses over the original is the ability to play in bed, since the pieces slide around too much!

One of the best Battleship-style games out there.

Several issues though: The rules on how lasers interact with atoms is not that straightforward. As a result new players may screw up clues. Also, unlike Battleship, there are not enough components to play two simultaneous games.

The components are spartan yet functional and chunky; they are a joy to handle. However, it might be convenient to play this as a pencil-and-paper game or with one of the many computer implementations.

Much better and more possibilities than Black Box. Plus it comes with that version too. The only downside is that you have throw away paper sheets instead of the laminated cards. But, it wouldn't be hard to make a card and laminate it yourself.

This is an excellent deduction game with nice components. But it is a brain teaser. There is way too much thinking in this game.

I really like the solitaire puzzles, they're great brain exercises. I don't know how successful I'll be introducing this other people though.

Edit: Got to play this with my good friend who likes abstracts, it was quite a hit! Like Mastermind for spatially aware people.

[b][thing=165]Black Box[/thing][/b]: [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8.5 [/bgcolor][/b] I just love this game.  Simple deduction - most of the time.  There aren't too many games that deliver this much deduction pleasure in so short a time.
[b]Black Box+[/b] solitaire: [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8.5 [/bgcolor][/b] The solitaire puzzles are quite pleasant.

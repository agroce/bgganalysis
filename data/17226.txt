RATING: 7
Rating based on 1 play.
The game took much longer than I expected, although I should know that from Doom, plus none of us had played Descent before.
It was fun though, but the final battle was a bit too easy due to killer magic.
I'd try it again, but I'm not in a rush.  Glad I didn't buy it when I had the chance a while ago.

This is not a good substitute for D&D if you are trying to cut out time, however it is a good RPG to play for only two people.

Really the best dungeon crawl ever. The hours just slip away while playing. It is so interactive at every step, it keeps you intrigued and active. 

I would like to play as a player more often, alas, I am doomed to slaughter them instead!

I would rate this higher if it didn't take so long to play. It just isn't something I could say "I will play right now!" at any time due to the length.

Picked up my copy finally at Buckeye Game Fest.  Now that my dungeon buddy Jeremy is doing Peace Corps in Kenya, I'm not sure it was a necessary purchase, but I've been itching for it forever, so hopefully it will hit the table.  [edit] After DescentCon at Chris's, how can I do anything but raise this to a 9?  What an awesome weekend; what an awesome game.  
One thing that would improve my enjoyment of the game is some kind of timer mechanism so it doesn't drag on and on.  I'm fine with investing a substantial amount of time in a game, but I want to be rewarded for it.  Some games it feels like you're just beating your head against a wall for hours before you finally concede.  This is a downside to the otherwise good house rule where the heroes can have negative conquest tokens.  

My like of this game has decreased somewhat, given that playing 4e DnD has made me realize I actually don't really care for tactical combat all that much.  I'd much rather play Heroquest or Warhammer Quest.

RATING: 7
Very tactical in terms of mini placement and use of hero orders. Has the cooperative aspects of Arkham Horror with even more opportunity for teamwork among the heroes. Elegant dice/combat system. Lots of theme. Negatives: long playing time (4-6 hrs). Game as originally released doesn't scale well for 2 or 4 heroes (treasure rules have since been changed). Too many quirky situations that should have been addressed in the rulebook (comprehensive FAQ is needed).

This is the game I have been waiting for! Descent is everything I wanted when I got Castle Ravenloft. I do still like CR very much, as I have come to appreciate it more over time; but Descent is much more game than CR is. I can't wait to get Road to Legend. I am looking forward to being able to play a longer campaign.

Update: I am now planning on getting the second edition instead of trying to get RTL.

Most played game of 2010. started painting the Figures. Been doing the Roads to Legends campaign as both a player and Overlord. Fantastic and challenging game. Wish I could play it more often.

Why oh why did I try the 2nd edition, that on reflection is awful compared to this

RATING: 5
Very cool concept, theme, and mechanics. A nice and fun authentic fantasy dungeon crawl. It took quite a long time to get through not very much dungeon, though, and the respawning rules seemed really gamey. I also don't care for the way the Overlord is encouraged to just kill the weakest hero over and over again.

Al principio fue un juegazo, en perspectiva, ya no lo es tanto, un buen juego para simular una exploración de mazmorra, pero la segunda versión o los "descent-like" que están saliendo hoy en día los superan. ¡Ah! es un juego que NUNCA estará equilibrado

RATING: 8
Great fantasy game with lovely game components. It is a bit based on luck (for example it happened that one player was cought in the web and stuck there for 10 turns and the OL not killing him off, which ruined the game for the heroes, as this character was the one with the strongest equipment. Also the trade stuff rules are so time consuming that you simply cannot do it...)

If you do not have the right equipment from the chests, it's game over.

So the beginning is hard for the players the end is harder for the overlord, probably strongly depending on the experience and team work of the heroes.

My, what a big box!  I have finally had my first games of this excellent game.  It was really good fun.  I was overlord for the first one, and definitely wasn't hard enough on the heroes, they won pretty easily.  The second two games I played a hero and we got whomped pretty good.  The second quest is very hard with only 2 heroes!  I really enjoyed though, a pity it takes so long.  I have to get both the expansions now!

RATING: 6.5
My play of this game has been more than once, but in general, it's just too over wrought to be the kind of game I want to play and own. As a dungeon romp, it delivers most all that you want: specific 'story' elements, lots of miniatures based combat, load of items. I don't personally like that one player plays the Dungeon Master and is opposed to the others. It feels like lazy design - the DM player just doesn't have as much to do because unlike regular role playing games, this one is pre-fab leaving the DM character just there to wreck havoc. In the end, I don't want a board game of RPGs. I'd much rather play a true RPG and be done with it.

Better gameplay than in its sibling, Doom the Boardgame. Still, I prefer Doom because of the theme and simpler rules. How you experience these two games is highly dependent of the dungeon master. It's on the DM's responsibility to make the theme present. In this way Descent and Doom resemble role playing.

2016-03-03
Descent takes the players for a potentially epic adventure of monster slaying and looting. The game feeds the most basic human cravings for killing your enemies and getting richer. 

Descent is also a very ambitious venture trying to simulate an action role playing game in a boardgame format. It takes quite a lot of effort to manage all the rules, unique items, character builds, spells, events etc. Throw in an expansion or two and you find yourself amidst mountains of plastic and cardboard. All this translates into a very consuming gameplay for something that should be fast and jampacked with action on an instinct.

Here the role of the dungeon master (usually the owner of the game) is crucial. He has to keep the players from analysing their moves too much. He is also the most important person at the table for the story telling and immersion. If you find yourself just pushing plastic and rolling dice instead of imagining yourself running in a dungeon with a sword in your hand, you know that you are missing the best part.

With the right group, Descent can be great fun. Play on a gut feeling and forget analyies. Clinch fists and throw yourself into an adventure.

I wish that descent would have a campaign mode, like Warhammer Quest. I also like the idea that the adventures should be more self-sufficient, not requiring the Overlord to use all those markers and cards of his, that just make the game sometimes too long.

I love the theme, but it feels like you spend hours getting to the final fight.  I've not played 2nd edition enough yet, but it seems that it corrects this problem by having each scenario be more of a final fight without the 90+ minutes of finding a key, wandering back, etc.

After getting a few more plays of 2nd Edition in, it definitely fixes the problem I had with 1st Edition.

RATING: 6.9
For those who have fond memories of HeroQuest from their youth, this game is like HeroQuest on steroids.  Suffers from overly long playtimes (6-8 hours or more, unless you play it all the time and remember all of the rules, official rulings, FAQs, and errata off the top of your head).  Suffers also from FFG's obvious lack of thorough play-testing (particularly when expansions are added on). Suffers also from fairly cheesy storylines. Also anti-climatic in that by the time the heroes reach the end of the quest, they are so buffed as to be able to take out the largest dragon with one swipe. 

The components are awesome, though, and the sheer amount of stuff that the game allows for is great (yes, we've got rules if you are stunned! or dazed! or poisoned! or are walking through mud! or lava! or on ice! or if you are standing on top of some mushrooms!).  I prefer the art direction here to the second edition, where it became a bit too cartoony/anime for my taste (in addition to having some of the cooler elements of the game removed in the dumbing down of it all).

I have hopes that I'll get another chance to play this when my kid is older and when I have a dedicated game room that I can shut the cats out of so that we can play this in little pieces over a number of evenings.

While the premise is enjoyable, the game is muddled and weighed down with things that serve no purpose. Why add loads of rock and hole tokens to the game when they could have been printed on the tiles? Why not give everyone a character sheet that can be written on rather than handing out a token for every stat that is raised? Why not handle money another way besides piles and piles of easy-to-lose chits? On top of all that, the game is slow. It feels unfair when the Overlord gets an advantage and every tiny action you do can be countered with summoning more monsters. This is one game that would benefit from slimming down and being more accessible, the rule book is twice as big as it needs to be. Still fun, but not as much as it could have been.

Beautifully designed game: amazing miniatures, great graphics... But why the hell I had to play for 16 hrs just to loose at the end. Scenario 2 is extremely difficult to finish if you are playing with 2 heroes only. I have played with One Fist and for all the game I did not managed to get any good weapon (one hand only) or armor, so I had to play with the basic Sword and Armor. We have played 26 turns where at the 11th we had have already get to the last room. So my conclusion is that the high amount of randomness in choosing your skills and drawing chest cards is  really spoiling the game. And it does not matter how good is your strategy - you might just not be able to get proper stuff. Frustrating!! Especially that this was third time when we were trying to approach 2nd scenario. More than 24hrs of playing just to discover - it is your luck not strategy which will make you win/loose.

There's a few things that could improve this game greatly. First, the models often come warped, especially the bases. Second, the quests are not at all fleshed out or believable, and are little more stated than, "Go here and kill XXX."

Finally, an option for playing without a GM-type person running the dungeon would have been a nice side addition for those groups of friends that all want to run characters and not play as the enemy.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Descent is the first dungeon crawler I've ever tried. It's a genre that never cought my interest, because I always thought that I would rather play an RPG instead of one of these. I have to say, that I liked it better than I expected. It's an interesting concept, but still not my cup of tea. 

To start, Descent is a game with a LOT of luck and it's also really long... and for me the two things really don't get along very well with each other. I don't want to play for 3-4 hours and depend on card draws and dice rolls so much. Of course there's a lot that a game like this can offer: Campaigns, different missions, scenarios, characters that get stronger and better! This is all interesting, but I think that for all of this a RPG works better. But most of all Descent doesn't give me what I search for in a boardgame. I miss the mechanics, the though choices to make, the planning and the feeling of achievement. Dice can't give you this. I know this game is all about the experience, but I don't like games that are focused on theme so much to forget to put real mechanics in.

It is like the Doom boardgame, but with some probelms fixed and things made cooler, and the theme improved (imo).  The overlord player is much more interesting with costs on the cards, and ways to accumulate more 'threat' tokens, and the balance seems far better.

This game is a whole lot of fun! It's slow - about 4 hours per game, but that doesn't matter - I'm happier playing this than 4 shorter games. 3 heroes seems to bring the right balance to the game. 2 is too hard and 4 is too easy.

This game does need the right group of people, given its length, complexity and strong fantasy theme.

My only complaint is the length makes the game tiring to play.

A good miniature fantasy cum role playing boardgame. Time to complete a game depends very much on the number of players.

The need for a 'dungeon master' to be competent in the scenario will make or break the game.

Due to friends moving away and wife not really enjoying the few games we have played I am putting this up for trade. Due to its size and the fact I really want to offload it with the three expansions all at once an "in person" exchange may be the cheapest option but will consider sending if I can face the effort and cost.

It is in as new condition having been played only three abortive times and much of the pieces have not been used at all.

Edit: This has now gone. Thanks to all who enqired.

I played a lot of D&D back in the days. This does bring back the memory and part of the fun I had playing D&D (at least the dungeon bashing part!).

The games are a bit long (time-wise), but they don't feel that long, we are kept entertained all along. With 5 players, it reaches it's limit, as some players might be bored between their turns. We played a 6 player game at first (one over the 2-5 players the game support) and it was just too many players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very fun dungeon crawl game that's only drawback is playing time. But even playing time can be fairly variable depending on the scenario and the number of players/heroes. The rules aren't overly complicated for a game like this to the extent that it is pretty easy to get a new player up to speed quickly with what they need to know to function at a basic level and then just introduce more specific rules as the situations come up. The stock scenarios have good variety with each tending to introduce something unique (monsters, tactics etc.). There are also a lot of well done, interesting fan created scenarios on the Fantasy Flight website.

While there are a fair amount of rules this is a game that can be picked up quicker than you might expect. I'd recommend the more experienced player play as the overlord if you want the game to flow along at a nice pace. For new overlords out there be sure to play a couple of solo games prior to running a group of heroes through a scenario, especially if they will be new players. This will help you get the rules down well enough that the game shouldn't bog down too much. You'll want to be able to explain each players options for each turn at least for the 1st room or so.  

There are a large number of expansions available for the game including a book of new scenarios. That combined with the fan created scenarios on FFG's website gives the game a huge replay factor. I'd count the Well of Darkness expansion as a must have since it provides several interesting monsters that work well with less experienced players. Weak monsters that still have the ability to hurt you are great for scaling adventures for different numbers of players and for players of varying levels of experience. The addition of expansions that introduce campaign play (Road to Legends and Sea of Blood) takes the game to another level. If you want to play the game a lot then these expansions offer an easy way to accomplish this.

RATING: 8
An enjoyable and well produced dungeon crawl with rules that are a good take off the DOOM system. The problem is that most games tend to play as follows:
-Heroes struggle for hour 1-2
-Heroes get better items and are a good match for the Overlord for hour 2-3
-Heroes get amazing items and the Overlord is outmatched for hours 3-4

Which leads to the next problem: when the Overlord does win, it can be extremely unsatisfying for all players. I've also noticed that all players are very interested and pumped to play for the first 2-3 hours, but after that it just seems like everyone wants to finish the game and push it off the table.

A great game, but not without it's flaws.

RATING: 7
This is the first rating I've ever given a game that's been higher than a 9. I've only played four times, but I'm sure Descent players know that 4 plays is equivalent to several hours of gaming.

I love everything about this game, but that is not to say that it is not with out its flaws. What pushes this game into the 9 and above category for me is that the flaws do not ruin the game for me. I don't get the same feeling when I play this game that I do when I'm playing any other game in my collection. I love playing Le Havre, but it is not as exciting as when I'm rolling to hit at a critical point in the game. I love the action cards in El Grande, but they definitely do not compare to drawing and playing the wonderful Overlord cards.

I love managing my resources in euros, but I never feel as tense as when I am managing the small number of resources that I get in Descent. I don't feel as satisfied in making clever moves in other games than when I make a clever move in a game of Descent. Clever moves come with flash in this game. They come with flash, luck, excitement, theme, and above all else, a wonderful game.

It's the best game I have in my collection. I want to play it all the time.

I could write so much about this game. The pieces and miniatures really appeals to me. And it's a cooperative game when playing with more than 2 players.

Still it's got a few flaws, and it's length makes this a week-end only game. It differs a bit from D&D in the way that the characters does not evolve/level up. It's the gear that makes the difference. That way it's more a strategy game, than an adventure game.

The biggest flaw is the balance when playing the standard missions or the expansion missions. With 2 heroes (2-3 players) it's almost impossible to survive, especially the big red non-named bosses. When playing with 3-4 heroes the game becomes too easy until they meet the big red ones. But then they do them faster than just two. So the 2-3 monster cards should been a bit lowered, and the 4-5 should have been upped.

I quite enjoy a dungeon crawl and there's quite a lot to enjoy about this one.  The Doom system adapts well to a fantasy setting and is easy for new players to pick up.  The plastic figures are really well done. 

There are also some negatives.  Magic isn't well differentiated from physical combat; it is just another way of zapping things.  There is also a lot of down time with a large group. Those are criticisms that can be made of many games in this genre.  My big problem with Descent is that it takes so-o-o-o long.  I'm left thinking that we could have done some actual role-playing instead.

Epic game. Lots and lots of heroes, weapons, skills, treasures, monsters, scenarios, dice etc. Great miniatures. One player has to play the bad guy (overlord) so the game is semi-cooperative. A must have for gamers who like fantasy, adventure, fighting and dice.
Caution: It can easily take 4+ hours to play some of the later scenarios.

RATING: 8.01
My rating after a single play (not the intro scenario)  With 4 adventurers that worked well together, it appeared that the Overlord had a slim chance for sucess.  Since I wasn't the Overlord, it was an enjoyable game for me but likely very frustrating for him.  Nice game, beautiful production values, the balance may favor the adventurers slightly with more players.

Update - played a few games now and despite the difficulty in getting it to the table and the long playing time, I find myself itching to play.

Update2 - increased my rating again clocking it in just over an 8.  Currently moderating this as a PbEm game and loving it more than ever.

I love Dungeon crawlers but I'm dinging this one, and especially my copy because the rules book was utter crap.  After hours spent pouring over the rules, and several plays we had no idea what was going on.  The book was constantly referencing other pages, which in turn referenced a different page and so on and so forth until just to find out how combat works you've got each finger on both hand shoved into the damn rulebook trying to keep your place.  The mini's are beautiful, the art fantastic, and I know FF eventually fixed the rulebook, but the 1st Edition of this game prior to all the errata and revisions was awful.  Skip it and just go get 2nd Edition.

+++ The miniatures are amazing
++  The story and the flavor are nice even for someone like me who does not really care about anything more than the game play 
+   Many options for heroes, you can choose whatever you need for a specific scenario
-   Slow, very slow. Due to the big amount of decisions to make, the game will take many hours  
--  Major dependence on dice - if you roll two consecutive misses it will be the difference between winning a game and losing a game, especially for heroes
--- So unbalanced! In general the game in two player vs overlord is a major kick for the players, you can be a poor overlord and still win and some scenarios are extremely tough (see no 2) and cannot be won even if players make no mistakes

A very enjoyable game. Maybe it takes a bit of a long time but that is not a deterrent as of yet given the excess of time on my hands. All by brothers (except the oldest) love it and this results in it being the ideal game to take out on the lazy Sunday afternoon. I'm hoping to try out some expansions. I imaging also that this will be played quite frequently during the summer.
It's fun being the overlord against dad and my 2 brothers given the strategy suggestions from my brothers, which tend to be amusing, before Dad brings logic back into the mix.

If you like D&D Combat scenes you will love Descent, Descent is like D&D but without the role playing part (You can add that if you like but that is not part of the "original" game).

The game takes a lot of time to play but once the players learn how to do the stuff the turn will be really quick.

RATING: 5
I used to play this game a lot. One of my very first 'bigger' games. It looks cool with a those minis, dungeon map and everything.
The beginning feels good, really thematic. It is a nice dungeon crawl flair with exploration feeling. The heroes are eager to discover new rooms, enemies, treasure.

But it wears off pretty soon (after ~60 minutes of playing, not counting setup). Tasks becomes repetitive: Try and get to the new room, slay monsters, try to be faster than the newly spawned monsters. Dungeon layout is often designed so you have to run back and forth (get key from there, move back etc.). While this might be fun once, twice or thrice is not. There are major turning points whenever the heroes get a new item tier (silver, gold). If the heroes got their gold gear, the dungeon master can pretty much throw away all cards that are not buffed by permanent boosting cards. But you can also decide to play these cards. It will make the game last longer but not more fun (fun in this games depends on the master being not a dick...).
The boss fights are always luck driven. Who rolls better. After hours of playing, this is frustrating.

If you're the one owning the game, you will end up being the master most of the time. Owning the game isn't that much fun.
I would like to test the second edition though.

Great game. Lots of "things" in the box so you feel like you have gotten at least some of that moneys worth. The game mechanics are good and the playing pieces are well made. A good dungeon crawler game. Complicated set up and rules are a little on the heavy side thus making a first time play through a somewhat cumbersome affair.

Fixes (more or less) the balance problems in Doom, but it adds an element of randomness (in the treasure draws) that I don't like.  I would like this a lot if it were a two hour game, but when it takes four or more hours to play, I'd rather have played something with more decisions to make (planning your turn as a hero seems to be a fairly uninteresting optimizatin problem).

If you want a dungeon crawl enough to overlook some warts then this is a good purchase.  You get lots of great components and a flawed but workable system.

If you have no particular attraction to a dungeon crawl then you get a rule book that's too long, a playing time that's too long, and rule system that can too easily become impossible for the heroes or impossible to stop the heroes.

The last part, I think, is the biggest problem.  The game doesn't always scale well.  We've had games where the heroes fell behind the power curve and just got swamped in a horde of enemies that regenerated as fast as we could kill them.  And we've had game were we grabbed a few powerful items and proceeded to kill nearly every enemy before it had a chance to move.

But I gave it an '8' because I have a group that really wants to play a dungeon crawl and is willing to work with the system (house rules) to make an enjoyable experience.

If you don't have that kind of interest, then stay away.

Great hack-n-slash adventure game, with a decent story feel.  Seems very difficult for the overlord to win, but I'm sure that's a side-affect of a few things with our first game, and not a problem with the game.  But really, I loved it, there's a lot of potential for some fun games here.

Descent is definitely not perfect.  Gaming tastes vary, so various bits will cry out for a house rule to each player.  Quests will prove to be unbalanced.  But, at the end of the day, it will provide a ton of dice-rolling, monster and player killing fun.

Played this game as the Overlord and didn't enjoy it at all. The skills and equipment the heroes get are very powerful and makes them almost impossible to kill about halfway through. The game takes a long time to play and yet there isn't much going on and it is very unbalanced. Maybe it is more fun with expansions.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent dungeon crawler.  Ingenious in that the DM has limitations as opposed to the omnipotent DMs in other games of this type.  This means GM is able to "win" by killing the characters without accusations of unfairness!  Seems reasonably balanced to both sides, and the characters have to get a move on to win

Beautiful and sturdy components and a lot of creature models.

Decided to buy this game to celebrate getting a new job after 6 months without work. Went to my FLGS in Reading only to find it was out of stock (and out of stock with FFG).  Aaarggh!  Drove to Oxford, where a friend had spotted a copy for sale, only to find the shop was closed.   Aaargh!  Luckily shop opened at 10.30am (!) and managed to buy the only copy there.  It had in fact been returned after 20hrs play (and apparently too many arguments!) so it was 2nd hand but all nicely bagged up, and was reduced by 33%.  Sweet!

This game was not what I was hoping it would be.  It has the characters and monsters from Runebound and is an ok adventure game but I feel like it should have had more character development like Runebound.  The items and monsters are designed in such a way that you will fight the strongest monster each board you play and have a weapon or item that makes this doable.  This means that the only way to play a campaign or even a small 2 or 3 linked adventures is to discard your items and start over.  You have the same character but you have so little to show for your last adventure.  I have not seen the campaign rules that where recently released but $120 is more than I'm willing to spend to try it out.

I remember when I first saw the enormous box sitting in my local game store "The Gaming Pit" back around 2009 or so. The game looked so intimidating with the dragon hovering over the heroes... I was instantly hooked. Due to the lack of funds, I couldn't purchase the game myself, but the store held nights where we could play the game. We played from 12 AM - 6 AM only to accomplish one quest; sad to say is that the majority of the time resulted in the heroes losing. This game was THAT hard. We didn't mind losing. The game immersed us in its realm, its story, and the fact that the overlord can seem like he is on your team one minute as an aid can backfire the next time you blink. This game felt much more than a game. It felt like a story unraveling without having to read. I highly recommend this game for the 2.0 release with the conversion kit. You are playing as a hero in a party attempting to overthrow the overlord who controls monsters trying to smash your faces in and devour the corpses. Different quests allow for different scenarios, monsters, and events to occur. An active imagination and roleplaying is encouraged while playing. I loved this game.

Descent has a lot of things going for it.  While not really similar to Dungeons and Dragons it's about as close as I will probably get these days.

a tactical miniatures game set in a somewhat generic fantasy world (based on Runebound).  While the fantasy theme seems a little generic it's still a lot of fun.

The two things holding this game back is the playing time, and the fiddly bits.  It's a pretty long game, and getting things set-up takes quite some time...especially to do it right.

a fair dungeon crawl game.Weighted far too heavily in favor of the players vs the overlord.Skills seem to be the broken component (either that or the character special abilities...I'm leaning more towards skills since you can purchase them)Players throw 7 dice by the end of the game while the overlord is still limited to 2-4.Players also tend to have abilities like Blast by then.  Overlord doesn't get the chance to do these.UPDATEThe game is almost playable with the first two expansions.The end game is still an end run for the most part, but there is a lot more tension in the battles from the beginning.

Nem vagyok egy nagy fantasy fanatikus, de ezt a játékot régóta ki akartam próbálni. Nemcsak mint az "egyik legnagyobb játék a boltban":) keltette fel az érdeklődésemet, hanem a fantasy-s ismerősök beszámolói alapján is kíváncsi voltam rá.
A szabályrendszer nem túl bonyolult, ez kellemes meglepetés. A játék maga viszont elég hosszúra sikerült (de nem árultak zsákbamacskát, gyárilag is 4 órát írnak).
Sikerült olyan pályát (5.) kiválasztanunk, amit teljesen esélytelennek éreztem, mégis nagy élmény volt, mert így szinte mindenbe belekóstolhattam, amit az alapjáték nyújthat (nálam tapasztaltabbak megerősítettek ebben). A taktikai elemek (teleport, lépcső, stb.) tetszenek, a szerencse szerepe nem volt bosszantóan nagy. A játék kivitelével is elégedett vagyok: mind mennyiségre, mind minőségre. A kártyák igényesek, a rengeteg táblaelem, és a sok böhöm nagy műanyag bábú alapján nem is tűnik olyan soknak az amúgy elég borsos ár.
Nem gondoltam volna előtte, de ezzel játszanék még szívesen. Annyiszor azért nem, hogy megérje megvenni, de mindenképp örülök, hogy kipróbáltam.

Apparantly the "Best Dungeon Crawl" at the moment.  I don't think I need to have this game in my collection.  I already have Arkham Horror for Coop games.

Descent is much improved over Doom; more options, seemingly better balance with changing number of players, and maybe it even moves a bit quicker.  The teleports and the way equipment is gained/bought are great.  Skills are hit or miss though, as they can easily turn one character into a very interesting one to play while leaving another character boring and ignored.  Still too long for me to play a full game regularly, but I don't think it could be shortened without cutting out what makes the game fun: the painstaking planning of each move.  I wish there were more dice, and I wish the weapons (and monsters) listed their average damage and range (though I could calculate it myself).

The best Dungeaon Crawler so far. Sure, it's still based on dice rolling but FFG has managed to add some healthy complexity to this genre. The possibilities added with scenarios and campaign are great.

For the most part, this is a pretty fun game.  However, the play time is just too much, so after five hours, I don't even care if we finish or not.  Too much investment for the fun that I get out of it.

I really do enjoy this game I just wish the rules was not so fiddly and awkward, yes the newer version as been streamlined as a lot of the mechanics was either broken or too confusing however I feel this has more of an epic feel. Certain aspects are unfortunatly a little too broken as I feel that the overlord can get way too overpowered too easy and make it almost impossible for the player to win. The hellhounds however for the overlord seem terribly bad and are rubbish. Still the game has its own charm

El mejor Dungeon Crawler en mi humilde opinion.
Utiliza las mecanicas del Doom pero dandole una ambientacion de fantasia medieval.
Bastante mas facil que el Doom.
Existe una expansion que crea el modo campaña.

An excellent D&D-type experience compacted into a more manageable time, and overall package. My kids love it. I found it very fun and offered significant improvements over the basic DOOM system it was built on.

RATING: 6
Update: my love affair is essentially over. Imperial Assault highlights every fault the original Descent has; it's such the better game.

----------

Update: Still loving this game but I think at least one rules question crops up every time I play.  And I've played well over 15 games.

Also, I completely gave up on Road to Legend.  The game balance is so out of whack it's almost comical.

----------

Update: This would really be a 10 if I could find a permutation of base game/expansion hero/OL abilities that seems balanced.  I still get a 10's worth of enjoyment out of it though.  =D

----------

I absolutely _adore_ this game.  I usually play with both currently available expansions (WoD, AoD) which seems to provide a nearly hopeless situation for the heroes, but I always enjoy the game nonetheless.

The game has a myriad of "flaws" in my eyes:

1) Game balance is very hard to get "right"
2) Scenarios can take a very long time, way longer than exploring 5-6 areas should
3) The spawning mechanic is cool, but its kind of boring for the heroes to always ensure they're staring into openness.  Also, the nearly infinite spawning capabilities seem to really drag out the game sometimes.

I could go on, but what's the point?  Do any of them detract from my enjoyment of the game?  No.

Best dungeon crawl out there!

Wow!!!!!! Descent ROCKS!! I really enjoyed playing through the scenarios in the base game (played through 1st 4). I will revisit this soon to play the "DescentQuest" solo variant. Everythin about this game, clunkiness and all, are an absolute blast. Getting new treasure, getting extra dice to roll, springing a nasty trap card (as the Overlord), it's all here. FFG hit a homerun on this one. I will not need to get 2nd edition as this box of goodies will keep me busy for years to come.

Loved this, my first sitting of this game, it was a game in progress and is a complete copy with all the expansions to date that exist. there were three regular players and a fiend and I sat in on the start of a session and took over one character each from two of the regulars, it was exhilarating and like no other board game I have played, I wanted it before, I REALLY wanted it after, but I have to weigh the ability to hit the table with this one, which sadly is not high for my regular group. I will try and get in as a regular on this group however as this is superb fun!

Note that one of the plays is an accident, and was not really played, it was a technical gaffe on my part.


04/07/11
Adjusted the score, the truth is I have not been able to play this one since that initial time, and though it left an impression and though I mostly would likely never turn down a game, I have not been able to get in one for some time. The reason I do not own it as well, as I knew games would be few and far between, it is still a wonderful game that I would love to have. But until I can own it or at least play on a semi regular basis, the new score is 100% correct.

RATING: 8
I think of all the adventure games I've played, Descent captures best the feeling of the standard dungeoncrawl.  Not very much in the way of character development (or not at all): the goal is to Kill Stuff, Not Die (much), and Complete a Mission.  This sort of "RPG" was never the kind that needed a GM who was willing to soften some blows, but a sadistic GM who kept everyone on their toes (but stayed within the rules of the system) was great.

As a result, Descent works extremely well for what it is.  Plus there are a lot of minis and a nice dungeon structure, which is a notch better than graph paper and little folded cardboard monsters (though I know that much better dungeon crawl bits are out there in general).

My oldest is interested in D&D (she's 11), but we don't have others to play. This game fits the bill. My only complaint is the time it takes to complete a game. We have yet to do one in a single sitting.

I'm traking down some "real" hallways and rooms from Dwarven Forge as well as minis from Wizards of the Coast to make this more lifelike.

RATING: 7
It is a good game.
It is quite hard to play balanced games, everytime, depending on the quest and the amount of heroes, either the heroes or the overlord will have a clear advantage.
But I think that it still is possible to have a nice time if each side is adapting their game to the strength of the other.
After all, each quest has a story and the heroes can have some fun killing monsters, even if they die in the end :)

RATING: 5
Lowered rating from a 7 to 5 after 4 plays.  I really want to love this game, but it seems that either the Overlord is going to win in the first few turns, or he won't win at all.  Furthermore, if the Overlord doesn't do at least moderately well in the beginning, the game tends to drag as the heroes battle their way to the end encounter even though they have no possibility of losing.  I've heard Road to Legends may help with this, but at this point I'd have to play it before I buy any more expansions.

Our gaming foursome spent many a late night with this game. So many victories, so many heartbreaks. Now that we're out of college, it's hard to commit to setting up and playing a few dungeons. It makes me sad because this is my favorite game. Unfortunately, none of us can stay up until the wee hours of the morning like we once could. We keep talking about dedicating a weekend to Descent, but it hasn't happened yet. We haven't played Sea of Blood or Tomb of Ice, and I stare longingly at the boxes every time we're at Rainy Day Games.

Very solid but I suspect the expansion (Roads to Legend) is required to give it a little more weight - my group transitioned from this into D&D4e and it may be hard to get them to go back without a little more continuity between sessions.

This game is probably the best dungeon crawler boardgame ever designed. It has a lot of depth, replay value and is just good fun. There are some balance issues. When playing with fewer people it's too easy. With a lot of players it tends to overstay it's welcome. And that may be the one major flaw in the game. The playing time is just too long and the game tends to drags on when the outcome is already decided.

One play based on the first scenario: it seemed a little too easy.  No tension.  It felt like a very a very slow version of Diablo II.

Using base and Tomb of Ice, I feel the game favours the heroes, thanks to Feats. It's far too long for me to play often, throwing needless roadblocks at the heroes for many hours until the final room where it's once again possible to kill the hero with 18 armour. I prefer playing hero to Overlord, but I rarely get the chance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is a great dungeon crawl, if you have time and space to spare. The game as written is most suitable for 4 players, one being the overlord, but can be scaled or house-ruled to suit any group or number of players. The replay factor of this game is infinite, as you can make your own designs. The monsters are great, the castings are great, but you may eventually desire to paint the figures. (It makes the experience even better.)
I love the game, but the time to set up and play often gives pause to taking it to the game store.

Mmmm... So this is what a Dungeon Crawl is like. My first endeavor with this game was with my eldest son. We decided that it was okay, but that it was just too long for what it is. I haven't got it to the table since. I guess we are Eurogamers at heart. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My wife is correct - the game is broken, unbalanced, takes too long and just isn't fun if you're the overlord.  Not worth the effort and time commitment.

That being said, the game is gorgeous and classically overproduced in true FF Games fashion, and really feels like an epic dungeon crawl.  With better balance, seems like it would be a real winner.  I ~want~ to like it.  As such, I've picked up the first expansion.  Hope to get it on the table, with expansion, to see if it can be saved.

I have an odd relationship with 1st edition Descent. It was one of my first real hobbyist board game, so it will always have a special place in my heart. It is also not very well designed. There are lots of choices for character customization, but only a few options are worth taking. The story may as well not be there at all, and the game play gets repetitive quickly. The dice were novel, though. Overall, I have fond memories, but the game hasn't aged well.

My favorite RPG.  Its tough and there is no guarentee you will win.  Each game experience is completely different.  You need 3-6 hours to play the scenerios.  You need a good cooperative group.  The length of this game varies depending on the heroes ability to agree.  The overlord will most certainly win if you are to slow to adventure or to cautious.

Since I was raised on fantasy rpgs, dungeoncrawls really appeal to me.  So does the concept of lots of stuff in the box.  THis game however seems a bit. . . off.

THere's a rule that says when one player opens a chest, EVERY player gets treasure regardless of where their character is.  This ok with the bronze treasures, but some of the silver and gold are extremely powerful.  We recently played a scenario where there were only silver and gold treasures.  To compensate, the overlord had an invincible monster that could only be killed by an item later in the dungeon.  Didn't help him.  Players got a gold level ruin that with enough surges, could clear most any room in one shot.  Only the demons took more than one hit to kill with this thing, and we had several similar ruins thanks to the every player drawing treasure rule.  

In the end, every single person at the table agreed the Overlord could not win no matter how well he played.  This was not the first time this has happened, but it's the most extreme.

This could probably be fixed by either limiting treasures to the player that opened the chest or by giving the players a set amount of lives like doom does, rather than a pool of tokens that refreshes everytime they find a town portal or open a chest.

The "killer DM" aspect is well done, and a pretty good variety in hero and monster abilities make replay value very high.  Some hero and item combinations appear unstoppable, but the luck element mitigates that as long as you make players stick to random draw for their heroes and don't let them select a dream team party or something.  Too long to play through a dungeon (4+ hours easily), and set up is a pain.  Greatly improved by the Road to Legend expansion.

RATING: 7
As a solid dungeon crawl, Descent does its best to recreate the atmosphere and feeling of a fantasy roleplaying session while at the same time leaving out all the roleplaying bits: it doesn’t play much different than D&D’s fourth edition but at least Descent doesn’t pretend to be an RPG. 

Fun as far as a boardgame goes, Descent has only a few drawbacks: it’s slow, repetitive and tends to last too long. [i](October 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Over the years I’ve grown tired of most dungeon crawls: I’m still attracted to them by their mere theme - as an old roleplayer, I’m quite fond of dungeoning - but the way they play bothers me, as everything boils down to rolling a few dice and checking whether a special power activates or not. What’s still worse though is, they have the bad habit of crawling way too slow and turning into long, endless sessions of repeating the same few actions over and over.

This is why during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered my rating from 9 to 7: Descent is still better than Heroquest. Well, perhaps it’s one of the best in the whole genre as well.

I enjoy the game, but I think I like Doom more.  I get into fantasy less than science-fiction (and Doom is more horror than sci-fi anyway).  Descent is longer and more involved, though this is an improvement in some ways, and while it is more balanced I find it's also less tense.

I guess "RPG in a board game" isn't fully my cup of tea.  I enjoy the game whenever I play, but I suspect it's more to do with the people I play with than the game itself!

After one play: Players familiar with DOOM will grasp the mechanics immediately. The big change is the introduction and expenditure of Threat tokens to activate cards from the GM's "Overlord" deck.

The chief drawback I see is the time that it takes to run through scenarios: expect to tie down a FULL afternoon or evening.

Love this game right now. Set up is very easy, explaining how to play is easy (with some player aids found here on the Geek) and playing is fun with lots of player talk and evil choices by the overlord. Like that there are plenty of scenarios including shorter starter scenarios available on the Fantasy Flight site and loads of expansions to try out in the future. With the base set alone each game is variable with the amount of different characters to choose, weapons to choose, treasures to find and how the overlord deck will play out. Very excited about this game right now and I don't see this excitement dying down anytime soon.

RATING: 6
One of the better dungeon romp games.  Seems like it's hard to play a melee only character (close combat can be painful & there are many enemy shooters).  Diversity in weapon skills seems important since you get treasure at random and cannot guarantee that you will find the type of weapon you need.  Those gamers that dislike shooting, killing or line-of-sight should avoid this game.  Takes a long time to set up (many pieces).  Also, the dungeon tiles don't fit together well (you have to force them together), which stinks.

Superb game, althought it would be very exausted to play untill finish.
Your teamwork capabilities will be needed in order to find a better strategy either to finish it faster or to play carefully and take step by step unnecessary moves. As for the Overlord you have to have a brilliant strategy to fight the powerful heroes, and during the entire game, you will create a lot of monsters, for that,you will be hated by the rest of the players who play heroes,don't take it personally anyway.

RPG game with the same "engine" as Doom. Based on first 6 plays I gave this one an 8. It went down to 6 at one point because I began to see many flaws into the game. We let this one rest a while and it recently got played again and I'm again addicted to it. I started using the levels created by other players from FFG's website as I feel these are more balanced and the playing time of 2-3 hours is a deciding factor in which ones to play. I think we have played this game so many times that it's safe to say you should own it. It's great and I was wrong in giving it a 6.

Our gaming group has changed so Role playing is off the table. SOLD IT.

Like HeroQuest and Warhammer Quest. Takes a while to play. Especially Road to Legend which is large and complicated. Either keep it simple and get the base set and NOTHING else... OR... go crazy, get it all, and play for six hours every time you bust it out.

RATING: 8
The essence of a dungeon crawl on your table. Good game mechanics and lots of opportunity for both the Overlord and player characters to play strategically and really get a leg up on each other. The mechanics are slightly weighted towards the player, but not by much.

Caveat: Don't make any other plans if you want to play Descent. Average game length is 4 to 6 hours.

RATING: 9
One of the best games I've played, period!  I love the theme, and the mechanics are excellent.  The rules do have some interaction issues at times, but this is something my group has no problem dealing with.  The games can tend to be 4+ hours on many of the quests, which can be an issue at times, but the Road to Legend expansion helps alleviate this to some degree.

The rules can be quite involved, and the game could be quite daunting to new boardgamers.  If you're new to boardgaming, a good game to play before this game is DOOM:the boardgame as it's a somewhat similar implementation of the same base game engine, with some of the complexity removed, and a somewhat faster playtime.

It's pretty rare for the heroes to beat a quest the first time, or even the second time on some of the more involved quests.  We play the same quest until the heroes win, so we're getting plenty of play time out of the official quests.  I can't recommend this game highly enough, it's great.

Older son and nephew drag me into playing this once in a while.  I have to admit it is a decent game it just does not interest me that much.  Almost too much for bits and process to it.  A one versus the party where I just can't get into.  I feel there are better games out there that are similar.  Not sure if the 2nd edition improves it but just can't commit to spending on it to find out.

RATING: 5
Similar in feel to DOOM, but I prefer the latter. Main problem is game length which is much too long, I'd prefer it with less 'restarts' after player death and make the monsters a bit easier to balance, in fact balance is a bit of an issue too - some characters/ability combos seem much much better than others.

I think the 'GM' player is the key here. All the games of Descent I've played the GM seemed to think their role was to be a GM, move the story along and give the players a fun time ... end result, all the players are ubermunkins tooled up for stomping the monsters. Scenarios play like that too, hence the volume/level of the nasties at the end. Better if the scenarios are tougher, the GM plays 'nasty' and the players have to make do with less powerups etc.

Overall I much prefer DOOM and that's probably because a GM in Doom gets the idea 'kill the marines' and the game is better for it.

The real dungeon crawler. I haven't played the 2nd Edition but I hear that version improves upon this great game even more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fantasy Version of the Doom Boardgame. Works surprisingly well. The added crome (tons of characters, treasures etc.) makes the game a bit less balanced (depending on the treasures and skills the characters draw they can stay rather meek or turn into killing machines). On the other hand the game has a great atmosphere.
It takes quite a bit of time to play and normally the Overlord(?) players turn will take quite a bit longer than individual hero player turn. This can be slightly frustrating for the heroes.
Besides these small complaints it´s the best fantasy themed game I know. The "tactical" level of play might not be optimal for players that are mainly interested in leveling up their characters, but I think the progressively better treasures still give a nice feeling of becoming more powerful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The "OG" versions of this game appeal to me as well. I just wish the expansions from these carried over to 2.0. Never got a change to play them and I regret it immensely. 

However, 2.0 simplified soo much I feel its not worth investing in the original versions. I would pass on this in favor of 2.0 unless your a collector and/or need/want the components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game feels like one big three hour tactical battle more than a dungeon crawl.  Since you see the layout before the game, you can mostly guess what your route should be.  I like the "ready" action and basic combat system, but it is somewhat undone by the after the fact combat use of stamina.  Overall, I would rather play Ravenloft with all its' faults in one hour than this slow slugfest.  Ravenloft just has more tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a fun dungeon-crawl.  The biggest problem I have with it is getting it played.  Many of the D&D fans just don't want to play a game like this.  For me, it's different enough to stand on its own.  Though my experience is purely as an overlord, where it becomes a game of looking for situations to take advantage of.

Another concern is the setup and play time.  Playing scenario 2 last night took 3.5 hours to teach and play, and we only got halfway through!  Just adds to the difficulty of getting it to the table.

I keep it because I like it, and it hearkens back to the old dungeon-crawler days of Hero Quest.  Great minis too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun dungeon crawl in the tradition of Warhammer Quest.  The combat mechanics are a lot of fun and, I think, an improvemnt over older games in the genre.  I also think the role of the overloard is a great game mechanic.  No longer are you competing agains a "dumb" game AI but now there's a player acting as a GM that is really trying to kill you.  Makes for a more satisfying game experience.  Components are all top notch and add to the experience.  Only shortfalls of the game are a very weak campaign support and excessive playtime.

Good game but blown away by second edition.  Mostly because this is so bloated and long and doesn't really go anywhere.  Just open the door and slay stuff and repeat.

Este juego lo conocí gracias a Marc y fue un descubrimiento agradable. Me recordó mucho al juego de PC diablo II al que estuve enganchadillo hace muuuuchos, muuuchos años. El jugador dispone de varios personajes (si son varios personajes, todos colaboran contra "el juego" que es llevado por uno de ellos) y te encuentras en unas grutas que se van activando por fases. En cada fase o escenario, pueden aparecer (y lo harán) diversas criaturas que hay que eliminar, a la vez que recoges objetos e items que te servirán de ayuda. Interesante.

[Bought Boston 2006-06-15]
The game that was released after Doom.
It has the same combat system as Doom, with just a slight difference which makes the game work better. The relation otherwise to Doom is in my opinion that Doom is more Go-Go-Go to survive, where as Descent is more tactical when choosing path to travel on.
Descent is a more meatier game compared to Doom and in my opinion slightly better. This mostly because they have added things that makes the game flow easier, but with longer playing time.

Rating based on two plays (one right after the other) of the introductory scenario.  We were having so much fun we probably would've jumped right into the next scenario.

Took over an hour to get everything out the box and check the contents (and then work out how to get it back in - IMHO baggies essential for this one!) Played the intro scenario twice now and have nearly managed to absorb all the nuances (we think!). Enjoyed it immensely! Based on their improvement over the 2 games, I'm sure the heroes will win soon! 
PS. The heroes DID eventually win and we still like it so much I'm even painting the miniatures!

I gave this game an honest try (four multiple hour session) but at the end walked away highly disappointed and disillusioned. The game is sooo imbalanced and just not fun. If I was still 11, I'm sure I would have liked it. Now, given the complete lack of real strategic choices and the monster length of a session, it does absolutely nothing for me. If I have 6 hours I'd rather play a wargame. If I want a light game, I'd play something shorter.  If I wanted to play a story driven dungeon crawl, I'd rather roleplay so that the story was engaging and the challenge balanced. Instead this game forces asymmetrical competition in exchange for fun. Did I mention that I really hate this game?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A frenetic paced monster hacking game that plays similarly to a video game. The coolness factor of this game is through the roof! But the scenarios in the base game go pretty long. (I've not tried any in the expansion yet). And while the game may be better in terms of fairness for the overlord player with three heroes, four heroes actually makes the monster killing go faster and is arguably more fun than three heroes.  Experience speeds up gameplay though making it a better time for all.  Also, bigger monsters are more fun.

Thie game is more Fantasy Flight junk. Which is a shame, because this is yet another game of theirs that should be good; not great perhaps, but at least good. But it's not, and the reason - wait for it - is pacing. You spend *so* much time in this game doing ultimately pointless and meaningless activity, the whole enterprise is compromised. Waste a few Kobolds, waste 15 minutes of my life. Kill some Naga, kill 20 minutes. You spend far, far too much time dealing with monsters who aren't a serious threat and taking a couple points of damage; as a result, the game goes on far past its expiration date. For comparison purposes, I think the combat here is actually significantly more tedious and less interesting than just playing D&D or some other d20 game, and I don't see why you wouldn't just do that instead. Or the vastly superior Battlestations.

Anyway, there is some fun on offer here. Just not enough to fill the box.

I'm a qualified fan of Doom: The Boardgame, and I think what that game has over Descent is the pressure on ammo and somewhat tighter pacing. In Doom, you're always worried about your ammo supply as well as wounds and there is pressure to keep moving, and far more of the monsters are legitimate threats to the players. Plus, the cardplay in Doom for the "invader" player is a lot more interesting and suspenseful for the marines (and more thematic ... too many Overlord cards in Descent have gamey rather than flavorful effects). In Descent, there are too many boring Master cards, too many unthreatening monsters, and too much general screwing around and not enough playing a game.

Now, having just trashed the game, there is one condition in which I would play again: if I could be gaurenteed a game that would complete in 3 hours tops.  Doom was a bad game salvaged by a good expansion, because the scenarios in the expansion seemed  well-designed, which the ones in the basic game were not. If Descent could have a similar tightening of its scenarios, getting rid of a lot of the junk, it could be fun. But as it is now, it's not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
My gaming group absolutely loves this game.  It probably stems from a love of D&D, but never enough time (or consistent show up) to get a real campaign rolling.  This game solves that with all the action, enough theme to tie it all together, and plenty of mayhem in a box.  Character selection can make a big difference in this game, and plenty is left up to chance, but it is usually very intense from start to finish.

My problems with this game:  the single game length can still be several hours, I'd prefer about 2, rather then 3 1/2 to 4.  The other problem is that it can turn really brutal.  For the overlord to win, he needs to hammer the weakest player, repeatedly.  For the players, they really stomp the crap out of the overlord, making him feel powerless when the players are winning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
The only thing I really have to say bad about this game is the length.  If you have half a day (or whole day) to kill and are into the dungeon crawler games then this is for you most definitely.

The miniatures are great (though many of the bases may be warped; to fix that just stick them in boiling water for about 30 seconds and bend them straight and dump them in ice cold water).  I would have liked to see the character sheets a bit more durable (like those in Last Night On Earth).  The combat mechanic is nice.

The first few times of playing you'll most likely find yourself referring to the instructions every 10-15 mins and that can get boring but once everyone knows what they're doing it gets better, runs smoother, and doesn't take as long.

Overall, the game is great.  It's just the length it takes to play that takes a lot out of it for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The run around and chuck some dice to kill things was fun, as was building up my character throughout the game.  However, in both of my playings, this was only fun for the first hour and got pretty boring and repetive for the remaining 2 hours of play.  I'd love it as a 1 hour game, but loathe it as a 3  hour game.  Replay value on this one is pretty low, as every game you chuck the same old dice at pretty much the same old monsters.  You can play as a different character to mix things up, but the differences in the characters are pretty superficial.  Like I said, it was kind of fun at first, but it would be pretty hard to convince me to play it again.

Two things rank this game has 'Heavy' in my mind:
1) It takes some time to play (4  hours)
2) Benchpressing the box (with components in it) will keep provide the daily exercise.

The game itself is not difficult, nor is its objectives, but the rules (at least the first few times) can require some looking up when things "Burn, what poison does, what the actions do, spawning critters, etc."  By itself, no one rule requires a library (think ASL), but they do require going over to make sure you've got them down.

Initially was very fun discovering all the different types of monsters and items.  Quickly degenerated into a grind where players spent tons of time counting squares and it lost its feel of adventure and became more about math.

Also don't dig how fast you burn through items and onto the next.  It feels like a very twitchy, hyper-caffenieted experience where you're racing through dungeons/items/monsters and never get to take a breath.

Road to Legend was very neat but being able to pick your skills lead to broken combos.  It also suffered from a runaway leader problem.

RATING: 7
The first dungeon crawling game I ever truly loved. Honestly in some ways, it's still my favorite.

The Pros:

-Playing just one scenario is truly satisfying and gives you a complete dungeon crawling experience WITH PROGRESSION. This is something no dungeon crawler since, even Descent 2.0, has managed to get right. The escalation as both sides grow in power feels epic. This is what drew me to the game in the first place and what makes it work for those of us who don't have the time to devote to regularly play an RPG.
-Fatigue is an excellent mechanic. Being able to strategically spend some limited resource just to get an extra square of movement or activate a cool ability or add a power die is great.
-Surges are also a cool mechanic. Adds more fun and variation to rolls.
-Playing as the Overlord is fun!
-Characters are varied and interesting.

The Cons:

-Can be lengthy. This is one of the few games I will sit down and devote 2-3 hours to, but now that I've played so many games of it that's less appealing.
-The balance is pretty fucked in the base game. Don't expect to win if you're the Overlord - your monsters suck too much. Except in a couple scenarios where the Heroes don't have a chance. Ugh.
-There's a couple things that are a little fiddly. Things like the different types of actions (move, run, especially readying) are unintuitive.

4 hours of "knock your socks off" dungeoning without having to purchase all those darn D&D rulebooks.  Overall, a well done game, with lots of bits, and great plastic monsters.

Edit:  I upped this to a nine after adding the [gameid=22361] expansion.  The game plays better with more stuff, and the extra ability to craft the overlord deck to your liking adds a lot of value.

Second Edit:  Since I have now added [gameid=29298] to my Descent collection, all of the Descent products that I own have been moved to 10.  This game is now considered complete due to the integration of Road to Legend.  Without a doubt, this game is the cream of the crop among its genre.  One of my favorites, and one of the best.

EDIT: 08/05/16 - I edited this down to an "8".  I love the game, but it has been sold off in a flea market because it sat unplayed for nearly 8 years.  There just wasn't any time to play, I have other games that I want to play, and it was just too big.  But I love the game, and if someone else was wanting to run a "campaign" (as that is really what this game is all about), and I knew I could dedicate the time to it (like a good D&D campaign), then I would jump back in in a heartbeat.  As it is, though, I no longer love the game like I used to because I don't have the time to dedicate to it like I used to.  Otherwise, if I were younger, and had different gaming friend that were more "D&D'ish" and less "Eurogamish", then I would play it more!

EDIT:  08/23/16 - After having talked to a gaming buddy that owns "Second Edition", and realizing that the new ap called "Road to Legend" plays the Overlord for you, I can now play Descent solo!  Woo hoo - probably the best possibility for me to play this game is solo, so now the "Second Edition" is the new kid on the block for me.

I owned this for years before I finally got my wife to play it. We both liked it, but it was hard to ignore the fact that it took ~4 hours to play! Deserves massive kudos for the achievement it represented, but it was made obsolete by the 2nd Edition, which plays much faster.

RATING: 5
Decent dungeon crawl game.  I really enjoy the atmosphere of this one and also how the sides of the dice have multiple purposes.  I don't really enjoy the combat as much as WoW tho, in fact World of Warcraft has better, more open-ended character advancement and a better combat system.  Another big downside is the length to the game. Its OK for what it does in that it provides a fun time and a good dungeon crawl, but I'd rather play WoW.

RATING: 7
Really fun dungeon crawl, although what I'd rather play is Super Dungeon Explore.  I think.  I haven't played it yet, but it appears to be lighter than Descent.  Descent against a very competent dungeon master can be excruciatingly brutal, which sometimes is a drag on the experience.  OtOH this means that any win you get is well earned.  I've seen some balance problems first hand but nothing so egregious as to totally kill the experience.

I've got no problem rating games after one play. For Descent, let's start at a 7. But, admittedly, ratings for this game probably mean more after a few plays to see how different games and scenarios unfold.

For a game that is supposed to last hours, this was less fiddly than I expected. Then again, I was the newbie running a hero, and I didn't have the burden of all the rule subtleties. What do I like? I like the cooperative aspect of working with other heroes. I like that heroes play differently. I like that line of sight matters, and the range/charge/damage dice are pretty cool. 

What don't I like? Any game with a massive rulebook can be a bit clunky. I suspect true Ameritrash fans relish in immersing themselves in rules complexity, whereas I tend to appreciate streamlined rules yet deep play. We got utterly crushed in our first game, but I don't mind... that can happen when you're rolling gobs of dice. Ultimately, I still felt that my choices mattered, and that will certainly keep me open to trying this one again. I'll still choose Heroscape for the wonderful plastic and truly unique and absurd selection of army options, but for exposing me to some good ol' Ameritrash, this ain't half bad. 

Update: Given that there's a new cleaned-up version of the game, I'd be willing to try the new version once again.

RATING: 6
Nice dungeon crawler. Another long but very pretty game from Fantasy Flight. It is like Doom but it seems the tide has turned and probably a little too far. It is now too easy for the players. They fly care free through the dungeons and get all the treasure. I'm not sure about the teleporting back to town to stock up. It seemed a little too convienient. It would fit more with the theme if they could only go back and buy equipment between missions and they kept the items they got for the next dungeon.

This game is a clusterfest. The Rulebook is a bit of a mess if you want to find speciffic answers to some rules questions, some scenarioes are strangely ballanced, the blue dice have purple icons on the cards (wich was VERY confusing in the beginning) and its hard to determine gamelengh. Can go very fast if the Dungeonlord wins, can take ages if the heroes are on the winning side.
But if you get used to all the mess, whats left is a hillarious Diablo III like dungeon crawler of epic proportions!

Fantastic components, the best of any board game I have ever seen.  Good, solid, fun game play.  Feels a bit limited for a experienced D&D player, particularly with randomly picked "feats" (i.e. skills) and pregenerated characters.  EDIT: played more, and increased rating from 8 to 9.  When you just need to kill some monsters, this game can't be beat.  Having the ability to play the Overlord is awesome: I think I like it better than being a hero.

RATING: 8
Better than Doom, but doesn't unseat Warhammer Quest as the ultimate dungeon crawl game (in my estimation).  There is more variety in Warhammer Quest, which I greatly enjoy, though at the cost of slightly higher complexity.  Graduating from Warhammer Quest to role-playing proper is also much more fluid, which I appreciate as a GM.  That being said, Descent is a fun game.  The length is indeed long, but not all that long for the genre it's in.  Familiarity with the game also speeds it up quite a bit.  I found it more enjoyable than doom, which partly has to do with theme, and partly a few improvements in terms of the card management for the "Overlord" player along with more flexibility in how improvements can be garnered for the characters.  If you're into Dungeons & Dragons, it's an even better deal, since all the miniatures and terrain are the correct scale and work very well for said game.  I just finished painting up the Hill Giant and will certainly use it in my D&D games.  Having web tokens, cone flame templates, etc, is also cool.  So, I had fewer reservations buying it because I knew I could get mileage out of the miniatures regardless of gameplay.  But, I find the gameplay fun and engaging.

This is my favorite game. I would rate it higher, but it is just too great of an undertaking to want to play this that often. I'm not in college any more so It's tough finding the time to set aside for this, and that makes me really sad. It takes a long time to play, but I always enjoy it, win or lose. There are some balance issues, especially with the expansions, but I love the challenge. As the Overlord it is fun thinking of new ways to mess with the heroes. The expansions make it more fun to be the Overlord, but I still prefer the challenge of being a hero. (25+ plays)

After first and only play so far, I thought the game took too long.  I don't mind long games, but the last three hours or so dragged.  That was even with obtaining cool weapons and stuff.

This is (so far) the game I have liked leaset. For me there is too much "downtime" in the game for it to be fun. Don't get me wrong, the theme is good, good looking game, easy to understand and play. But each players turn can take 10-15 mins for everyone to agree on what to do and then when the overlord has to set up another room that is another 5mins+. I would still play if others wanted to as it is not horrible but I doubt it would ever be my game of choice.

I have only played this as a somewhat-hobbled Overlord, with my children (ages 9 and 7) playing the heroes.  As such, I doubt I'm getting the full flavor of the game as it was intended to be played, but I *love* the game as we play it.  It can be a bit long, but then, if it were shorter (and the ramping-up quicker, as it would have to be), it would lose something.

Great game. New players can be introduced to the rules easily. The Fantasy theme was done very well and having 20 heroes to choose from can give each game/quest a unique flavor. Also, the gameplay mechanics are a natural evolution from Doom.. and it shows!

Fun game.  

The game is pretty simple but the rulebook is HORRIBLE!!

It's very hard to find the rules you need quickly, some are missing, many of the rules and some of  the cards are not clear and worded very strangely.  Really no excuse for this.

I bought the game to play with my kids (10 and 7), they should have loved it but having to look through the rulebook every two minutes puts a damper on the fun.

Bottom line is that I would rather teach them how to play Dungeons & Dragons instead.

Descent, in my opinion, focuses on the hack and slash while I find the thinking part of D&D much more interesting and fun.

This game is a great game! A nice dungeon crawler!

It brought me back to my days of Heroquest.  But even better.

Anyways, I've had plenty of exciting games with this one.

RATING: 4
Edit- played with the expansions a few times and I'm ready to give this one a two-point bump.  The expansions fill out the game quite a lot (while adding even more bells and whistles, which the game arguable doesn't need), allowing for more variety not only in terms of in-game action but also in terms of potential scenario design.  The new monsters, traps, heroes, and equipment make for a lot of variety and play styles which is a good thing.  I still think the game is too slow and poorly paced- if this could come down to a regular 2 hour game it could be one of the great dungeon crawl/adventure games.

Original comment follows:
A game that wants so badly to be great that it's depressing to watch it fall so short.  It is indeed like a pumped-up, more complex version of Heroscape but with an exaggerated playtime and about 30% too many bells and whistles.  It's probably a better game than DOOM in the long run, but it's functionally the same thing with more window dressing.  I'd rather play the D&D board game or Mutant Chronicles for this sort of the game.  I was disappointed in the overall lack of atmosphere or story and I found that toward the last quarter of every game I've played that everyone's interest and enthusiam tends to wane as it turns into a hack-and-slash slog to finish the scenario.  It isn't bad at all, really, just bloated and more boring than it ought to be given all the awesome components and some neat mechanical ideas.  If you're the overlord, say everything in a Bill Cosby voice and the game is HILARIOUS.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Pretty fun game.  There doesn't seem to be too much to it so far, but it's fun to drop crushing blocks and slay hellhounds.  The long setup time is a downside, but hopefully we'll get this one down to a three hour playing time.  The base game feels like it's missing a component that shakes things up.  Too straightforward at this point.  Maybe an expansion will change the game for the better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A very fun game. Lots of atmosphere. Not the deepest game but the team play adds greatly to the fun. Not sure this has staying power for me at least. Its a cooperative RPG type of game so it has camaraderie and the appeal of leveling up but really there is no deep strategy. This game is better than Doom because it has magic items you collect and overall the character system is better. The game is better balanced as well.

The premium tactical dungeon crawler. It is a bit complex, lots of rules and variations. It also has tons of abilities and combinations for the player characters. Awesome and quality miniatures and dungeon tiles. The best Dungeon crawl availiable. Super bad ass!

RATING: 6
This is the best "dungeon crawl" game I have played. The plastic miniatures are just great and there is a ton of other goodies in the box. The rule book could be set up better and really needs an index. Also, I just hate these over sized rulebooks that FFG puts out. They are too large and unwieldy and even the version they have for download is this ridiculous large size, so printing it is a pain in the ass.

The base games lack of campaign rules really lowers the score for me. The new Road to Legend expansion really added a lot of new dimension to the game, but it took 3 years to come out! There ought to have been a decent set of campaign rules published with the base game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Thoughts: I really enjoy this game and it's complex dungeons. Its always scary to open a new door, not knowing what could be behind it. The decision of returning to town and allowing the Overlord to power-up is always excruciating. The only thing keeping this from being rated higher is the time investment. Our first dungeon, from set-up to tear-down took almost seven hours, though that did include a rules explanation.

RATING: 10
Awesome blend between a tactical game and a [u]dungeon crawler[/u] - one player controls the monsters and the others the heroes. Wonderful miniatures & huge production value (80 minis - half are big size, 500+ tokens, hundreds of cards, modular map, tiles etc.)! Has a free scenarios PC editor. Easy to make custom scenarios for this game.
But it's hard to bring it to the table because the high number of components and finding a group of players can be hard.
Suitable for [color=red]solitaire[/color] games using a variant posted on BGG.
Better than "Descent v2" which is a simplified version of Descent and has only half of minis.

We really like this game, especially considering what it is.  The only real failing is that it is tough to get the balance just right so that the game doesn't feel that one side is too much stronger than another.  Long games are ok by me so long as I'm enjoying every minute of it, and Descent does just that.

RATING: 7
I did not expect to like the game but I do! I was afraid that it would feel like an oversimplified RPG dungeon crawl instead of a boardgame. Well, it does not because one fundamental difference: the overlord is not a neutral arbiter but tries to crush the heroes as best as he/she can. 

The game looks good, especially the miniatures. (rating +1). The length of a full game is an issue: ~5 hours is a bit too much (rating -1). The biggest problem of the game, however, is its "downhill" structure: it is too difficult for the heroes in the beginning but ridiculously easy in the end game (after they have drawn good treasures). In all the games I have played so far the final fight with the boss is not the culmination of the game but a foregone conclusion: the boss is usually killed before it can take a single turn. (rating - 2). Finally, the game has not been sufficiently tested and balanced: for instance, the threat cost of some of the overlord's cards is clearly off (compare Explosive Rune and Beastmen War Party); some characters are much better than others etc. (rating -1) Despite all this, I do enjoy the game both as the overlord and a hero.

RATING: 4
If playing with fewer than 4 heros on the board, it just isn't fun. The heroes and monsters basically walk up to each other and roll dice until one dies. Rinse, repeat. Blah.

With 4 heroes, their various abilities and strengths are able to work together based on positions, enhancing the group in ways that let the player be creative about the battles. Not very creative, but some.

This one's good, it just takes way too long.  If the players are at least mostly focused, turns can move fairly quickly.  But, like any big game like this, distractions can slow it down a LOT and you can easily find yourself in 6+ hour territory.  After that much time, the lack of persistent rewards is especially anti-climactic.

Also, it might be tempting for traditional pen-and-paper DM's to play nice as the Overlord, but it seems like a bad idea with this one.  It's really easy to be too nice, as the player characters are fairly buff or can get that way quickly, and if the players get bored you're in the danger zone for drag again.

Supposedly, the Road to Legend expansion addresses these issues, but I haven't used it yet.

Great design, the only flaw seems to be the inherent snowball-mechanic, when the heroes or the overlord can't really do anything to prevent the other side from winning if a certain critical mass has been reached.

What can I say? It's ambitious, long, and a blast to play. Marta has yet to try it, despite my requests.  The expansions balance things out for the players and with the overlord, and add so much, especially the road to legend. I can now play something akin to D&D and spend all my time actually playing, instead of my whole life designing the damn thing and then the rest of my life playing it. 

F2F trades only on this one for this and all expansions excluding the adventure book and Sea of Blood.

Actually, I don't own the game per se.  The owner left it in my house where a group of friends met to play different games every friday.

A wipeout later, we all agreed I should remain a Nice Overlord.

After demoing this game 3 times over the course of two days this past weekend, I can say that although it is a long game it is always met with enthusiastic response.  This has also been a great board game to introduce to primarily role-players.  I have yet to sit down and have a bad game of Descent.  The length will definitely get to some people.  It would also be nice to get some decent variants or expansions that expand this past a 5 player game.

I've played a few games now with my four boys, ages 8-14 we all simply love this game.  The component and art are wonderful.  My kids have played with friends, too and anyone that plays it enjoys it.  The rules are complex enough that an adult should learn them and teach them to kids if you are planning on having kids play.  Also, don't expect quick games.  Even simple scenarios are several hours long.

RATING: 7
I want to love this game, as I really enjoy dungeon crawlers when done well. But in the admittedly few sessions of this I have played, it is labriously slow and just takes so much effort for so few rooms. I think the nature of a good crawler should be like Nethack -- moving through lots of different rooms/levels/experiences, rather than a long-drawn-out tactical combat scenario that doesn't in the end provide enough variety or enough character development. I'm keeping this one on my shelf, and still hoping to like it more in future. But I haven't been motivated to buy any of the expansions, and I'm not hard to sucker into buying expansions....

(UPDATE 9/2008: I have now bought all the expansions because Road to Legend was so highly praised. I'm getting back into this game, wanting it to be good, but starting really basic at vanilla Descent, again. However, I'm using the user-generated scenarios and looking in particular for the shorter ones like C.R. Kirby's "The Rescue." I'm hoping this will hook us. Raising my rating to a 7 to reflect my reinvigorated desire to like Descent again.)

Fast and fun play - there's a lot of pressure on the heroes. Still, not what I really want out of a dungeon crawl. It feels an awful lot like a hack-n-slash video game. Would prefer more rounded characters that I can play with over multiple game sessions.  (But, that's the never-ending boardgame quest: the RPG-lite boardgame.  Most say it can never happen. Who knows?)

The most requested game by my 10 year old son and 7 year old daughter (when we're in the mood for some good ole dice rolling Ameritrash). We love the theme and gameplay. The only minor downside can be some fiddly rules at times, but this one is always requested and almost always occupying the space on our dining room table. There is no doubt that when we want good ole roll the dice and smash the baddie hack fest that this game is number 1.

Tomb of Ice expansion coming soon? Sheesh...time to open the wallet. My wife just rolls her eyes at the blue boxes I bring in the house....not to mention breaking out the paint set yet again.

RATING: 7.5
A solid game and probably the best value for money I've ever had out of a game in terms of what you get in the box (I bought it before it became a rarity so I'm talking about RRP here). Even if all you do is use this game to flesh out your other games you've still won!

The game pretty much tries to cram in a full adventure, including trips to town and leveling up as part of one session. If you have the time, it's great. But that's the kicker. The game is a real time sink - so much so that you end up playing it less than you'd like. The first time I played this game it took us about 8 hours just to complete the first adventure (over two days). If you can invest the time in this game it's great. If not, forget about it.

My kids love it.  The game favors the heroes as written, but seems this would be easy to modify.  It takes too long to play a full quest.  But it's a lot of fun for this old RPGer to play with the kids.  I could easily make some shorter quests and all would be happy.

I love this game, especially if I play the Overlord, but play time is just a bit too long for my group (three hours would be perfect), which means that it becomes a game we play over beers on our gaming "retreats" in the evenings. However, there are a lot of games that also fit well into that slot and it's hard to drag the game out to wherever the retreat is. That said, I've got nearly every expansion and the scenario book, and even got a Road to Legend campaign going for a few months.

My favourite game of all time, but in particular with the Road to Legend expansion but each one is excellent though Sea of Blood is the only weaker link (but is almost a must have to compliment the Road to Legend expansion). Its a great game to throw every expansion together and just go for it, but the negatives are it can be a long game with an often murky or confusing ruleset. However if you invest some time into learning it you'll be more than well rewarded. I can see playing this for literally years to come.

Just started playing an expansion loaded Descent campaign.

WOW
Great system, bizzarely the campaign can be played in shorter sessions than the vanilla game as dungeons consist of multiple small floors instead of one uber dungeon.

Allows a GM lite roleplay experience (low preparation required) and allows the GM to play competitively vs the players.  Variable overlords and abilities allow future campaigns to play differently.

Fantastic Game.  One of my favorites.  It needs a spare set of dice, but that is the only knock I have on it.  Great adventure experience without overwhelming new players.  Love the dice, the items you can acquire, and the whole framework. 
Update: played DescentQuest & loved it.  The rules are solid and straight forward.  The balance is very good.  The random rolls are great, keeping it from getting too mechanical.  Well worth a $30 order to ArtsCow to pick up the 4 decks required.

RATING: 9
A great translation of Doom: The Boardgame to the fantasy world.  The translation has resolved most of the issues that people had with Doom, though the balance between the Overlord and the heroes can still be off.  The first three scenarios clocked in around the four hour mark, but we had a great time throughout.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Play time is a little on the long side but well worth it.  The cooperative aspect of the heroes against the active role of the overlord is a perfect combination.  Very little downtime keeps everyone involved and a balanced scenario requires skilled play on both sides of the table.  Not the most balanced game around but extremely fun; you just have to accept some gameplay mechanics and roll with them.

The more I play the more I enjoy Descent.  There's enough depth to allow for some good tactical decisions and enough variety that no scenario will ever play out the same twice.

Awesome components. Played it. The shortest mission with 5 players went 6-11pm. Many times the OL would spawn mobs, move them to attack, but get one shotted by a player. Many dice to roll, but most conflicts were instant kills for the monsters -- could have rolled 1d6 and kept  my monster on a 6 to save time. Would greatly prefer a variant where there were fewer mobs, that required coop play to kill, and lasted 3 rounds. 
UPDATE: played with a brilliant OL and game was very fun. OL was a minatures/wargamer and maxed the utility of his creatures. I'm not adjusting my rating due to extreme length and the one-shot aspect of some monsters. Perhaps the expansion will adress this? 6.5

I really wanted to like this but found the background uninteresting and generic, and the game far too long for my tastes. I jumped on the second edition, which was better, but still the Terrinoth world is a bit of a snore, which is a major problem for a game that tries to tell a story.

RATING: 5.5
Fun game of heroes hacking their way through dungeons.  Hero players play vs. the Overlord, who controls the monsters.  Game is tactical, requires cooperation among the hero players, and has excellent replay value, since a defeat by the Overlord will require the players to try that dungeon again.  However, the downsides of this game are the size and number of pieces, setup time, and most of all, the extended length of time to play.

Ultimately traded away for several reasons.
1. I like, but don't love the game.
2. Doesn't scale well, and I don't like the idea of one player playing more than one hero.
3. Lengthy FAQ and rules clarifications (which would make becoming familiar with the game difficult as I couldn't get the game to the table frequently enough).

A fun to play game, but when played with a group used to Dungeons & Dragons the gameplay is a bit too simple, which is a good thing for new players. The game can be terribly hard at some points, yet also blindingly easy at other points, rather than being balanced all through the game, which is unfortunate. However, the game plays nicely and especially the first play when all the item rewards are still unknown, collecting treasure can be loads of fun!

Descent is a game I enjoyed a lot the first few plays, but that quickly changed. I have two main issues with the game after about 10 plays. First, it takes way too long for what it is. Second, there are too many fiddly rules which help contribute to the length. Too much time is spent each game looking up some rule nuance. If the game only took 2 hours, it would be bearable, but at 4 or more hours it is downright tedious. I have played as both the Overlord and a player.

A game of great skill, satisfying teamwork, great components, and tells a unique story each time. Captures about 60% of the RPG experience in a system that has discrete rules and, thus, infuses the competitive element found in board games: excellent game.

I played for the first time last night.  The first mission (which the FAQ warns is really easy).  It was a game where I (as the DM), couldn't do anything to stop the players, in the whole course of the dungeon I probably hit about 25% of the time, and only managed to kill one adventurer.  I felt very powerless, and that's not a fun thing for any player (DM or otherwise).  I'll have to play some other missions in it, and see how they fair.  Hopefully they will be harder on the player characters.  The components are great though!

This is a great dungeon crawling game.  Sometimes the LOS of sight requirements make this play more like a board game than a thematic dungeon crawl.  Your game experience depends heavily upon the Overlord player.  This game is well known to have imbalance issues, but for me it adds to the game.  I recommend playing against the Overlord with at least 3 heroes, especially if you add the expansions into the mix.

4 games, all 2 player.  An interesting take on dungeon crawls.  Character generation is diverse but artificial, the main difference between characters is that some are solid and some are sucky.  Overlord, just keep killing the weakest character.  DOWNGRADE.  I'm pretty bummed out on the weak 2 player scaling right now.  UPGRADE.  Okay way better with 3 heroes but horrendously long, millions of little tokens everywhere, and there was too much arguing.  UPGRADE.  Getting better but still brutally long.

Rating is for base game + all expansions as I play with everything combined, hard to rate the expansion separately.  I've played more Campaign games than regular scenarios now but prefer some things about the regular scenarios.  The big thing I find missing is the tension that the heroes have when worrying about their Conquest tokens, each move seems to be more important and challenging.  On the other hand the Campaign is great because you get to build up your character over time which I really enjoy.

I typically end up playing as the Overlord because it is my game but I have more fun playing as a hero.

I love this game more and more as I play it.  I feel its tough for a party to play through but it makes the win all the more rememberable.  I would rate this game a 9.5 but it's length just does not allow this to be as playable for me.  Desire is there but the ability to take 3-5 hours just to get one scenario or aspect of a campaign done just takes this game out of consistent play for me.  If it was up to me I would bring this up but objectivity lowers the score significantly.  Btw this is my personal #2 game.

You'll hear it a million times in discussions of this game, but it's just too long.  It has a very cool design and I don't find it fiddly or too rules heavy, but I can't budget six hours for clearing four rooms in a dungeon crawl.  I can't imagine getting through the longer scenarios!

It makes me curious about the Second Edition.

RATING: 6
A really fun dungeon bash with the right crowd, but there are some balance issues that keep it from truly being the PvP fest it sells itself as.  Had to reign myself in a bit as the DM to make sure it stayed fun.  Needs some house rules as well to bring it up to D&D level of tactics (attacks of opp., flanking, etc).  I'd like to give it a 7 or 8 for the fun factor, but the game is a 6, and the crowd I played it with was worth 2.

Up to four players take on the role of dungeon explorers, and battle it out against the dungeon master player.  Each turn the players can take two actions, which have to be declared at the beginning of their turn - move, battle, or order.  The dungeon master sits there gurgling and giggling over his deck of evil tricks, controlling the beasts in the dungeon.  There is an objective the explorers have to complete in order to win, while the dungeon master is simply trying to deplete the explorers supply of dungeon "conquest" points.  Fantastic production - miniatures, counters and dungeon map pieces - solid dungeon hack mechanics (see Heroquest, Advanced Heroquest, Dungeons and Dragons Boardgame, etc).  Some good tactical decision making involved by all players.  The down side, and it's a biggie, it takes several (4+) hours to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is fun, but it takes wayyyy too long.  Maybe that's partially because of our careful play nature (clearing every room) and frequent rules questioning due to infrequent play.  I like that the bad guy is less reactive and can take some steps to do things.  The figures and quality of the game is amazing, as one would expect from FFG.  But at some point when playing this, I can't help but feel I'd rather be roleplaying then just plowing through monsters, so I feel less excited about this than I might otherwise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Despite a large amount of initial skepticism, I have to acknowledge this is a well-produced adventure game. The adventures are great and the special powers are well done. 
 
While not innovative, FF did a great job assimilating mechanisms from a bunch of different old Games Workshop games. The GW dice system saves a lot of charts and hassle once you get used to it. The thematically hokey runes or glyphs or whatever allow for mid-game powering up and prevent player elimination. Best of all is the wholesale porting over of the one-vs-many system from Fury of Dracula, in which the 'Overlord' moving the bad guys has his own challenges to face and resources to manage. All of these put Descent head and shoulders above most similar titles. 
 
Alarmingly absent is any form of campaign system, which will be a huge sticking point with most players who are attracted to creating storylines or history and enriching the experience, and I predict some backlash beacause of this.  Errata aside [yet again FF is guilty of a shameful lack of playtesting and pre-press editing], Descent is a worthwhile investment if you want to have one-night-stands of dungeoncrawling.

I honestly do not understand other people's complaints; sure, it IS long, but NEVER in my memory has a game of this length completely held everyone's attention and excitement for the entire length of the game (even Diplomacy, maybe my favorite board game, usually gets tiring and frustrating by the end of a marathon session).  Maybe you need to play with 4 players; I could imagine it being too easy (and therefore not tense or exciting) with 5.  Everyone wanted to play it again.  Don't listen to the haters!

One of my favorite dungeoncrawler games ever. Pretty easy to learn if you don´t try to teach every little detail and every special feature at once. I´m not convinced that 2.0 is a better game than this (although I liked the idea of defensive dice instead of a fixed armor value).

RATING: 8
I feel a game so big requires a lot of words, but don't feel like writing a lot of words right now, so I'll leave you some bullet points:

- It's big, it's long, it's sometimes worth it, and when it's worth it it's really fun
- If the bad guys start winning early they win all game; vice-versa for the heroes.  You really want a game that's pretty balanced to feel that it's close the whole time.
- It's long... did I say that already?  Prepare for a 4-6hr experience if you are playing with people who like to think.
- It's got a lot of replayability.  There are dozens of characters and dozens of character abilities which change every game.

2 on the Cindometer.  Creepy monsters and a game this long would never appeal to her.

RATING: 9
I have all the expansions, but it's hard to bring to the table because it takes soooo long.  Haven't been able to mess with either campaign setting yet, sadly, for similar reasons.  Also the game can easily be shifted in the overlords favor for most maps with the expansions and knowledge of the game, but keeping things more even is entertaining to attempt, anyways.

We went through a full campaign of 1st ed back when.  I've always enjoyed it, but it did have a few rough patches.  

Teleporting back to town and going shopping in the middle of the adventure was king of strange and broke up the flow a bit.
The most bizarre part, though, was the monster spawning system.  As the OL accumulated 'threat', he could use it to bring in reinforcements, which he could then move immediately on his turn.  But, he could only place them in out-of-the-way corners where the heroes had no line-of-sight.  So, you were in constant danger of being ambushed by packs of monsters who would appear out of nowhere.  You might think this would increase tension, and it kind of did, but mostly it lead to this repetitive gaming of the system where you try and position your heroes around the room so that they can see all the nooks and crannies.  And if you ever missed one, boom! a bunch of goblins, or spiders, or blood apes start chewing on you.  This system warped the entire way the game was played.  Instead of sticking together as a team, you were always fanning out to cover all the angles.

1st ed was always a bit too complex for its own good.  It was generally good complexity, but no denying that the deluge of cards, chits, and minis made it tough to manage.  I think things like the hand of hero special power cards (introduced in expansions) were kind of overkill.

Based on 1 - 4 player game and 2 - 2 player games. Best dungeon crawl game I have ever played. I thought Doom was a pretty decent game even with a few problems but this game improves on the system and the variability of the game is much better with all the possible permutations of 20 different characters, skills and items. The first scenario seems a little too easy for the heroes but it is an introductory scenario. We played scenarios 2 ans 3 after that and it was a very close contest each time. The Overlord player has to play a very good game though to hope to defeat the heroes; the game is not very forgiving of bad Overlord play. The componants are all amazing but I really do not understand why FFG never includes separate reference sheets for these games. It is really annoying to have to go in the rules for the rules on abilities and such or to look at the back of the rulebook. All in all, a very good game if you do not mind the 3-4 hours playing time with 4 players.

Hideously, hideously unbalanced, with any number of players. Totally unsuited for campaign play. The included scenarios have a tipping point: before then, you can fail; after that, you are guaranteed to succeed. Poorly organized rulebook.

On the other hand, it does have a nifty dice system. And that's a whole lot of bits for what you pay. But you won't catch me owning this one any time soon.

Fair.  It's pretty fun, but has a lot of stuff to keep track of.  I don't know that all the extra stuff really adds that much more to the game -- I prefer the greater purity of Doom.  Unfortunately more people these days seem to appreciate fantasy themes than SF ones, so it's harder to get people to play Doom.  Personally, I'm burnt out on fantasy and would rather play something a little less cliched.

RATING: 7.5
Hermano de DooM, tiene sus mismas mecánicas básicas. Aunque añade mayor variedad con todo eso de las armas, hechizos y tiene una dificultad más asequible para los héroes. Además hay más material como las ligas de Edge que pintan muy bien ;D

Descent básico te pide a gritos de una expasión, yo os recomiendo el Altar (antes que el Pozo) como primera. Y si sólo puedes/quieres comprar una entonces sin duda la campaña, Camino a la leyenda.

Según comentan el juego básico favorece demasiado a los héroes convirtiéndolo en un paseo. Bueno nosotros con unos personajes cogidos al azar (una maga y otra un poco de todo que se curaba), no hemos pasado de la primera zona XD

Un gran juego algo más dependiente de la suerte que su hermano Runebound, al que debes tenerle en cuenta que te requierirá de 1 hora para la preparación de la partida y de dos a cuatro horas completar la mazmorra a los jugadores (si lo logran, claro).

RATING: 7
Would have given this game an 8 if it weren't for a couple of issues.

1.  The length of the game--4 hours???  Try 8-10 if you pause to think even a little bit about strategy between turns.

2.  The game kind of depends on hit and run tactics, which gets a little repetitive.

3.  The game is all but unplayable for two players unless the rules are modified.  The overlord will ALWAYS win.

4.  Good luck reading the adventure text with a straight face.  It's that bad.

That being said, there are a lot of good things about this game.  The combat system kicks ass, the characters are extremely varied, there are interesting treasures, and the modular dungeon layout destroys any claim to HeroQuest being "customizable."

This is one of those games that I would certainly play if offered, but I probably won't bring it up myself mostly because of the time involved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game can go two ways. Great or poor. The rules are not clear, so if you have a really argumentative player It can really detract from the game, as they are not prepared to compromise. The rules need to cover every situation and be laid out better.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Probably just because it's such a hot item and because I want to feel like I spent my $80 wisely, but man I think this game is fun.  It can be tense and laid back all over the course of a single game.  The heroes might just toe the line when they have 1 conquest token left, then over the next two turns be back up to 7 or 8.

A great crawl game, and the crawls take a long time.  This isn't really an issue for me, as I enjoy this type of game and enjoy the development of a character over the time spent.

I am playing a Road to Legend campaign and the game is good. The major flaw it has, in my eyes, it's the eternal same-iness: we are doing the same stuff all the time. I think I'd rather play Descent 2.0. In any case, with this system I'd always choose Doom because I like the theme way better.

RATING: 4
UPDATE: Now that we’ve seen Descent 2e and Imperial Assault, I can never see playing this game but I appreciate the foundation they laid for later games.

UPDATE: Frankly, the length of Descent has made it hard to get it back to the table. (That plus the fact that someone has to DM the game means that for three players, you only get two adventurers) Castle Ravenloft has pretty much replaced this game for us.

Played twice now and we had a great time. Imagine playing D&D but less "role-playing" and more tactical. It seemed a little long but we had a lot of fun. I am really looking forward to playing again.

I do like this game.  I do not like the crazy amount of time it takes to set up and and to get through a full session.  Should a game's merit be knocked down based on this?  I think so.  I do however like the mechanics seeing as how I love grid based tactical rpg video games such as Shining Force.  My group does like this but I'm getting sick of games that take over 30 mins to set up and over 4 hours to play and another 30 mins to put away.  When I think of the amount of time needed to set up a game, play it and put it away, playing a stratey RPG video game is a far better use of my time.

Hardcore Eurogamers or those with a short attention span need not apply, since the game takes a while to play and moves a bit slowly; they may get bored.  However, if you really like Dungeon Crawl games, or tactical battle games, you'll probably really like this game.  Nice bits.  It feels like a video game to me, with player death not meaning much, and respawn points.  The campaign system is weak, but GREATLY improved by Road to Legend expansion.  Lots of replayability.

A nice dungeon-crawling romp with overly cheesy fantasy language in the quest descriptions. Lots of chrome in the form of cardboard tokens and flavorful rules.

This is probably the most played '7' game I have, mainly because of how much my two sons (10 / 5) like to play it.  After about 30m, however, it devolves into a massive plastic "army man" fight-fest... (ie: mash the plastic figs together while they fight.. slash! slash! wham bam!) however, this suits me just fine as there doesn't seem to be that much depth here.

RATING: 5
Nice premise of having a tactical game of dungeoncrawling. But the execution is a letdown. I can imagine having great fun with this with my old RPG buddies but the game takes way too long. For that length, you might as well run a [i]real[/i] RPG session. And you need to play with the expansion. The expansion makes the Overlord more powerful and makes the mission a more-close-run thing for the heroes. Otherwise, I don't see how the Overlord can win. That's with 4 heroes of course. Can't imagine trying with anything less.

RATING: 6.5
I bought this game because it was on sale and I thought to myself that it would be like DnD but faster and possibly more enjoyable because of all the 3D to it. The first few games were great, but it became tiresome. Too long and too tedious. I think it is the same problem I had with Tide of Iron, in that it is not short and easy enough to do quickly, but not so involved that I would want to play it for 6 or more hours. This middle ground kind of kills it for me.

After 1 (unfinished) play: Just your basic dungeon crawl.  We armed ourselves with spells and weapons, we fought monsters, we explored the dungeon, we found treasure, we repeated until it was time to go home.

It is a big, impressive dungeon crawl and the best fantasy themed game I have ever played (with the exception of Runewars).

Not perfect by any means, but at least you can see that long time ago FFG put a heart in game making process. There, even base set is a huge game with about 80 plastic miniatures (and rightly so; if you pay for a game about 100$ you should take this kind of stuff for granted). Huge replayability and really game enhancing expansions, not some watered down trash in "more of the same" type served for 2nd edition.

Grand, unique game of the past times when FFG actually respected its customers and not treated them like a wallets to milk. If you can get this game, do it. You won't regret.

Very enjoyable dungeon-crawling game.  The competitive aspect of it is great fun.  There are two drawbacks: it's very fiddly, and it's very long.  Neither of these are a problem with the right group and a good long afternoon, but it's too long to be the ideal beer-and-pretzels game it wants to be at heart.

RATING: 6
It's too long, too fiddly, needlessly complex, and little more than a dungeon hackfest.  So why do I enjoy it?  Probably because my 10-year-old daughter adores it.  If you don't have a similar opponent, I would recommend Runebound (which exists in the same fantasy universe) instead.

Haven't played as much as I'd like, but our last game inexplicably ran until three in the morning, which has put me off it a little. Also, I'm playing enough D&D right now that a dungeon crawl isn't usually what I'm looking for when we sit down for board games.

I'm updating my comment after playing Star Wars: Imperial Assault that I consider to be the refinement if not perfection of this system. I rate SW:IA a 10 and Descent a 3. 

The crux of the problem with Descent was how the Overlord would activate all his guys at once and pick off one hero (often strolling by others) until he was knocked out. Then repeat. This was THE way for the OL to play every scenario as it worked. And the downtime waiting for him to maximize his 10+ dudes and cards was annoying. It felt imbalanced in terms of both power and fun.

SW: IA uses group activations that fix that balance of power and downtime beautifully. Now, the Imperial player can only activate a subset of his forces. This may be 1-2 powerful guys or 3-4 Average Joe Stormtroopers. The result is more interesting choices for the Imperial player and a more balanced back-and-forth among all the players. 

To further imbalance the fun factor, the OL gets to level up way more than the heroes. After a session, the OL gets  "experience income" (Conquest points) and purchases upgrades, not the heroes. SW: IA fixes this by both sides getting to purchase skill and/or weapon upgrades after a session but with the winning side getting more. How simple of a fix is that?

The result of all this is the OL and the heroes have very different experiences. The OL gets to play cards, play a wide variety of monsters, and make a lot of different decisions about using them each turn, and generally get to spend more Conquest tokens. The heroes plod along with a few dice rolls and only occasionally have enough Conquest to purchase a skill upgrade (and even here several have been nerf'd for the RTL expansion). 

All in all, I'd much rather have the OL's experience for 6 hours than a hero's.  My prediction was that this was the best of breed for its genre at one point but another game will come along at some point and make this obsolete by addressing the flaws identified above. Little did I know that, per my prediction,  SW: IA would come along and fix the flaws I identified above.

RATING: 9.5
I was deeply, deeply disappointed with Doom, so I was very nervous as I purchased this game on faith, without having played it beforehand.  But everything that failed in Doom has been revitalized in Descent.  Each character is unique and interesting, the tactics dont feel repetitive (yet), the scenarios are entertaining and seem relatively balanced.

So far, each game I've played has ended at the final room, and has been within a die roll or two of going to either side.  Very satisfying, and very different from Doom where it was painfully obviously unbalanced.

The characters become powerhouses by the end of each adventure, which is good because the challenge and resources available to the Overlord player scale at a similar rate.  This makes a single game very satisfying, although those who crave a long character-development pseudo-RPG may be disappointed.  I think the variety of experience each playthrough more than offsets this loss, however.  Each of the hero characters is unique and exciting.  If I wasn't always the Overlord player, I'd want a crack at playing each of them.

Surprisingly, it comes with optional campaign rules which look like they might actually work.  I doubt they'll give the heroquest fans the sense of continuity they crave, as the heros get "reset" between each game, starting out each new adventure better equipped as they continue through consecutive dungeons.

Enjoyable dungeon crawl.  The game has a lot of randomness -- bad dice rolls can set you back or save your neck, and even the ability draw at the start of the game can have a big effect on the game.  Expect your first few plays to take a long time -- but you really don't mind the hours flying by because it's FUN.

I've played it three times now with three different groups and while it's definitely on the long side (7 hours for Scenario 1, 6 hours for Scenario 3 -- I play with a bunch of computer programmers who are always trying to optimize everything) everybody has had a lot of fun and never wants to quit early.

This was my first introduction into dungeon crawl games and I love this game.

The characters are simple, weapons upgrade your stats in a simple and clear way. 

You can see the dungeon set out in front of you and so can cover your corners somewhat. 

Treasures are simple.  

The game master of this felt that our game group was ready for more and so we moved on the actually role-play (D&D 4th ed.) and have never come back to this,  although I did paint one of the dark elves to use as my character for the D&D sessions.

Note: It moves just fine if the heros use speed and mobility instead of trying to kill everything.  This isn't apparent at first and the game can get bogged down if you are overly cautious.  I read some threads on the Geek to get it all to click.

Not as structured as a traditional board games that have a definite play time and set things to do in a certain order, but its a fun sandbox to play in.  It's very wide open and it allows lots of light tactical action and group interaction.  The quality of the Overlord can have a lot to do with play time and difficulty. All I can say is that its a lot of fun.  Great dice system and awesome theme!  Can't wait to play more.  You need a group who enjoys the theme and understands that it's not a traditional board game and the enjoyment will be group dependent and not always balanced.

It brings back some early D&D memories!

I should probably just play the road to legend, as the regular game lasts a bit too long for me. With road to legend, play sessions could be shortened to however long I wanted.  But if it sits for a couple months, I would have forgotten what was happening in the story...  The heroes always seem to lose (which I don't mind, since I play the overlord).

Old-Skool Hero Quest -style monster smashing. Gotta love it. Mechanics are identical to Doom The Boardgame, but Descent has more expansions and thus offers more replayability. Here's a brief list of pros and cons of the vanilla Descent with zero expansions: 

+ Simple rules and mechanics
+ Tons of stuff
+ Easy to learn, especially when teammates help n00bs getting around dungeons
+ Strong theme. Requires an experienced Game Master, though.
+ Adjustable difficulty.
- Setup time from hell. Add the expansions and you'll get storaging from hell too.
- ...And the constant setup & browsing roulette continues during play. The GM has to keep everything close, since one often needs to find proper gear, figure, trap, effect tile. But then again, it's up to the GM to keep the tension high during the dull browsing sessions.

Not entirely sure about this yet. The game is a blast to play with the right people, especially if everyone can get into the spirit of the game. The long play time hasn't yet been an issue to me, the majority of the time everyne has been immersed in the game right until the end. I do think however, that the game is poorly balanced with certain numbers of heroes. I'm working on a few ways to make the game much harder for the heroes, I think that winning should be harder, and therefore heroes should feel a sense of accomplishment if they win.

Similar to Doom: The Boardgame, but the system has been tightened and works much better here. There is dice rolling, and it's a little easy for the players, but with an imaginative master that is not afraid of moving out of the scenario, the game can be made challenging enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really thought that I would enjoy this game more than I ended up doing. The campaign feels drawn out- and min-maxing feels more like a chore rather than an accomplishment. As the "tank" class who chose to go DPS, i feel that my role tends to be very muddy when it comes to actual scenarios- I find myself wanting to do damage since I am not really able to soak the damage for my teammates. (Since the DM is smart enough to not focus me)

I feel that taking the knight class to relieve offensive pressure from the DM would have been more useful for my allies which frustrates me when I play this game (since I am a true min-maxer at heart, I would rather not deal any damage and prevent all damage from my allies as this role if possible) and I think that was a mistake in character class picking. 

The LoS mechanic is confusing at times and can result in ridiculous situations such as blocking yourself from making a shot. I think it needs to be changed.

The rest of the game is very enjoyable and I enjoy the cooperative aspects- I just wish it wasn't at the expense of whoever ended up being DM- seems too much like a one-sided game as soon as one side picks up speed from the first few quests. My experience has been HEAVILY hero-sided, and that can be bland and dull and end up making me feel bad for the DM.

Fun, but a few to many unnecessary pieces.  The game also should have more information on the cards.

This would be ok if there was not enough room on the cards to print the rules you needed.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A dungeon crawler that is much more sophisticated and offers a lot more choices for both the heroes and the overlord than classics such as HeroQuest. It can overstay its welcome a little bit, however.

My first game (with 2 newbies and two players who had played a few times before) ended after 7 (!) hours in the final battle against the boss monster. A good part of those 7 hours was certainly caused by the players being a tad indecisive at times, some of it seemed to be due to the combination of skills that came out (interrupt alert!), and no small part was due to the somewhat ridiculous final battle against a monster the heroes could hardly even pierce the hide of. The rating reflects the hope that most of the scenarios are of a saner variety.

One thing I'm not quite sure of is how I feel about the concept of the city that mainly has two consequences: It's very simple to, in the middle of the quest, teleport back to safety, rest, buy new equipment etc. which seems oddly out of place. Maybe more importantly, though, it means that dying is pretty much inconsequential for the heroes. They do lose a few conquest points, and those are by no means unimportant, but it does weaken the connection to your hero considerably: "Oh well, I just died. Pah, doesn't matter, I'll get you next turn, then!"

RATING: 7
After the letdown that Doom was, I can't explain why we dared to try this one.

One of the best dungeoncrawls ever made.  Set-up time and game length can be an issue; other than that though, this is the premiere dungeon crawl game.

2nd Edition's reduced components show us how spoiled we were in 2005, when plastic, shipping, and bits were cheap.  I'm looking forward to seeing how much cleaner the 2e rules are, and especially how the campaign mode is set up.  If it looks good, I'll take the plunge.  Otherwise, I'll keep the classic.

Good fun, especially with the boys (except the younger one gets a bit bored, which is partly the fault of his brother that tends to make the decisions for him, the curse of coop games). Good diversity and replayability, a certain tactical requirement. Main problems : plays a little too long maybe for what it is, and above all feels a bit too long to set up and take down. The road to legend extension made the game really interesting to me with both sides gaining experience (plus you can actually play the game with less time on hand as you can cut into smaller chunks than the traditional scenarii, although the total campaign is obviously very long and I'm far for certain that we'll ever see the end of it)

[i]When I played the vanilla JITD, I thought that a campaign mode sounded like the greatest thing imaginable.  In reality though, the new mode adds some overhead to rules that are already a bit convoluted in places.  Now there are additional convolutions and areas of ambiguity (and yes, more errata).

On the other hand most of the encounters/dungeons are shorter, which makes it easier to break out and play. Most of the one-off scenarios in the other expansions require blocking out an afternoon while this one can be played in a couple of hours.[/i]

I love this game!  But I hate how long it takes to play!  It's my classic love-hate relationship with 'ameritrash.'  The later scenarios are especially lengthy (one game took 3 sessions and then only because the players decided to give up).  We tried putting time limits on player turns but it still didn't help...the game simply takes a very long time to play.

+++++ 7.5

No way do we have enough time to try this - maybe #2 will be better

I played a few campaigns of D2E (Shadow Rune, Labyrinth of Ruin & Shadow of Nerekhall) prior to playing the original D1E with a campaign (Road to Legend).  While I like both games, at their cores D1E and D2E are fundamentally different games.

D1E plays more like a tactical dungeon crawl with an overarching storyline (i.e. go to a dungeon and get treasure, then go to town to heal and buy stuff, and ultimately go kill the final boss).  D2E is more like a lite role playing game in which completing the objectives often trumps defeating enemies (i.e. go investigate what's going on around the battlefield and fight enemies if need be, but complete your mission before the bad guys complete theirs).  Ironically, D2E is more linear in storyline (the winner of one quest determines which quest will be played next), whereas D1E offers a little more freedom as to where your heroes can go next.

Overall, I like both systems for the unique niches they each offer, but I wouldn't necessarily own both games.  I would recommend a Descent edition based strictly on whether you are looking for a more classic dungeon crawl style game (D1E) or a lite RPG (D2E).  Personally, I already own a few dungeon games, so I'm happy to own D2E vice D1E.

A very good game but has LOTS of rules and those rules change with each expansion. I still think we must be doing something wrong, as everyone says it is so easy for the heros in the first dungeon, but they have yet to win one game yet. The game parts and things you get with the game are terrific. Lots of minis and tiles for making many, many different types of dungeons. I really like this game alot, I just wish I could figure out wth we are doing wrong to make it more balanced.

Quite a few random rules that apply only in certain cases require you to refer to the manual.  I write these on a separate notepad for reference.  Other than that, very solid game with a feeling of advancement.

Would be better with an automatic Overlord, less casual player death, and no "glyph" warp zones.

The ONLY problem with this game is the long playing time - otherwise, it's a wonderful dungeon crawl game with plenty of color & splash & story arc.

Fantastic pieces, great theme game.  Instructions and layout do a great job of carrying the dungeon-crawl feeling.   I like the unique game mechanic of overlord vs. heroes.  Good opportunity for teamwork or opponent minded players.  The quests tend to be relatively balanced between hero or overlord advantage (with exception of the first couple).

The Well of Darkness and the errata online do a good job of clearing up some rules and errors in this original game.  

Numerous quests, different overlords, and monster spawns makes for a game with a ton of replayability.

RATING: 6
Its a straight up dungeon crawl, with no storyline.  The mechanism is simple enough, I just don't think its very tactical.  Even though I am sort of bias towards fantasy theme games, this one just doesn't do it for me.  But with the right group of people that all enjoy dungeon crawls, I think it would be a good game.  From all the reviews, I think the addition of the "The road to legend" expansion will push this game up in terms of my rating for it.  But as it is alone, its just too much setup for little gain.  

If you've read my reviews, I play (or try to play) many games solo, even this monstrosity, there is a solo variant but it just isn't much fun for very long.  The monsters just doesn't appear intelligent, and there is no longer any surprises.  This game is much better with a GM.

Rating after 4 plays. A very enjoyable dungeon crawler with a nice rule-system that allows for meaningful decisions during the game, lots of different combinations of characters, skills and items and a creative freedom for making your own scenarios. The only real drawback of the game (if you don't consider the sheer size of it such) is the rather long playing time, although it seems to depend on players and adventure. With the right combination, you can have a hugely fun dungeon romp in 2-3 hours. Still, even during the longer games the time flew by while playing, so it's not painful... just time resource consuming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
 A good dungeon-crawling with more chips and bits than needed, adding to the downtime. 
Also, magic is used just like a missile weapon. I' d prefer some specific spells or items (staffs - rods - wands), with specific "effects" and consequences.
 
I 'd never say no to a session, but Doom would be my preference.

RATING: 4
I liked it with Road to Legend campaigns but I just don't see any reason to own it.  There's a ton of math to do and lots of fiddling around with stats, bonuses, surges, etc.  It just doesn't play smoothly enough for me.  Tons of accounting to do on every die roll.

Still it has to be *the* tactical miniatures boardgame out right now, the flavor and campaigns are really amazing and cool.  I tried the Seas of Blood expansion.

RATING: 6
I have to admit up front that I've never been all that impressed with dungeon crawl games in the past. The either were too fiddly, trying too hard to be RPGs, or they were just shallow and boring dicefests.

Descent manages to stay in the middle of the range nicely, and ends up being an enjoyable experience.

I like the different characters, and the lack of charts, graphs, and 'development'. I like the bits, and the dice with their various qualities are just brilliant.

I'm worried that the overlord's only real strategy is just to overwhelm the heros with continous spawning, and the more spawning, the longer the game takes to play. I'm not really fond of the playtimes as it is, but the game is easily packed up and resumed later, so its not too oppressive.

Overall, Descent fills the dungeon crawling, monster killing niche quite nicely, even if the gigantic box doesn't fit my shelves the same way.

Update 2013:
After playing more recent dungeon crawls, Super Dungeon Explore, Claustrophobia, etc, this one isn't likely to ever make it on the table again.

I really want to like this game more than I do. But I have a number of issues with it that tells me that Descent is not the dungeon crawler I've been looking for. If I want to spend 4-5 hours hacking monsters in a fantasy setting, I would much rather play D&D (which actually takes less time, and is more interesting). This game plays much more like a first-person-shooter, and I'd rather play Space Hulk or Doom instead of Descent.

Looks fantastic with beautiful miniatures, especially the white monster figures (why FFG use horrible red/green/blue miniatures in their other games is beyond me)... I grew up playing RPGs / Dungeon Crawlers on the SNES as well as the HeroQuest BG so Descent really appealed. Still, I don't think I'll ever get time to play it, and my only real gaming parter is my fiancé who isn't really into this sort of thing. We played once and the game was rather long and hasn't seen play again - now sold.

RATING: 8
With the second edition of this on the way, I figured I'd write out my first review on BGG for one of my favorite games in my collection.

This game looks like a dungeon crawler but plays more like you're manipulating a swords-and-sworcery wielding SWAT team. Running and gunning without a plan will allow the overlord to swat down your group without breaking a sweat. Tactical movement - covering angles, staying close together, planning targets - is essential. Combat is dice-rolling, and with all the randomness that dice entail. The unpredictable element just forces you to play more strategically and throws a monkey wrench into your well-laid-out-plan quite often.

I love the asymmetrical nature of the gameplay. Playing as an adventurer turns the game into a tense race towards the end, as lingering anywhere too long will get you killed as surely as forging ahead too quickly. And in contrast, playing as the overlord is an experience not dissimilar from squashing ants with your thumb. Chipping away at the adventurers, timing your attacks and traps, is excellent fun. Most often, however, it comes down to a single strong attack and some unlucky rolls from the adventurers and it's game over. It's very similar to the Diablo series - the weak monsters will barely scratch you, while the stronger ones will punish you mercilessly, killing you multiple times.

With all the rules-mongering and strategic placement going on, however, the atmosphere of the game suffers somewhat. It feels odd to have traditionally stupid monsters act in perfect harmony to out-flank adventurers. Another problem is that in order for the overlord to win, he has to kill the adventurers - any of them - enough times to deplete their pool of tokens. What this leads to is the optimal strategy for overlord is to simply gun for the weakest character, over and over. Every monster, every trap, every spell will target the same adventurer, and every time that character is brought down the adventurers creep closer to game over. The game then becomes no fun for the adventurers. When the overlord isn't using such cheap tactics, however, and is evenly matched with the players, the balance is generally excellent.

The modular board, while adding plenty of replayability, is same-y enough that you feel like you're running through different variations of the same dungeon. Some more variation in the tiles would be nice - but I believe that the expansions fix this problem.

The length of the game can be somewhat overwhelming, and it is complex enough that you have to refer back to the rules often. I'd call it D&D-lite, but it's really not that much lighter in rules - the experience is just more streamlined. The pacing is good, however, and the constant escalation of both player and overlord abilities makes it so that there's plenty going on to sustain interest. Adventurers are constantly getting better and better loot, and the overlord stockpiles enough tokens to pull more and more dangerous tricks out of his/her hat.

It's such a monstrous game - it requires more table space and time than any other I own. But I've had some spectacular sessions of this game, and when everything clicks it's a great game of combat-heavy strategic dungeon crawling.

For an RPG old-schooler like myself, this is like the 'good ole days'. Fun, hack n' slash dungeon crawling glory. It's on the long side (like 5 hours long side), but a very fun, tactically challenging game. Nice looking bits make this one a must have for any RPG geek like myself.

Don't play this with two players; it sucks.

This is definitely a game you need 5 people for, but expect it to last as long as an RPG session. The shortest game I've played with 4 people took 4 hours. YMMV.

I just got Descent for Christmas from my parents and grandma. It is a fun but VERY VERY long game. The first run through took us over 6 hours and we didn't even get half way through the first quest.

Second run through was quicker and I imagine the last will be even better. I had hoped for a bit more....something. Better than heroscape, but not quite to the level of D&D.

Update 11/2/2012: Lost a lot of interest in this game as well. Time factor is part, but the unbalanced nature of some of the scenarios also doesn't help. I'd like to try the second edition.

Even though D&D board games already exist, this game really FEELS like D&D, so much so that it's really difficult to believe that it wasn't originally conceived as such from the beginning. There is much potential here, though the rules seem overly complicated at times and are not well explained in the manual. If I were rating the manual itself, I would give it a 4 or 5 out of 10. There's a lot of gameplay here for those who want dungeon delving without all the time spent developing characters.

Reminds me of the old GW Heroquest but with much more details.  The fact they include 20 heroes is awesome and adds a ton of replayability to the game.  This is one of the best dungeon crawl, players vs DM style boardgames I have played.  Its the huge amount of small details that make this great.  From randomly determined skills to the number of special abilities, this takes this style of game to the next level.  The one problem though is that due to this complexity it's not a quick game.  That's the one thing keeping this from a 9 or 10, the fact you need an entire evening to play.  It's also not the easiest game to teach a new player.

A tactical dungeon crawler, where one player is the overlord and the other players are heroes trying to solve a quest. It is based on the mechanics of Doom.

I was disappointed at Doom, which is the main reason I haven't looked too closely at this game as they are descendants of each other. Personally I think this game does it right as there are so many frustrating points with Doom.

The game is mostly tactic and there is more strategy in the game than most of its type even if it is resource management. There are several scenarios in the game box and once you have completed them they feel old, but there are expansions and scenarios on the net. The scenarios in the game and expansions seem generally not very balanced and favor either the heroes or the overlord and many are dependent on getting the right heroes and skills. There isn’t much development with the heroes with interesting choices. There will be combos but once they come they will be pretty obvious.

Solid dungeon skirmish game. I wouldn't like it nearly so much if I hadn't tricked out my set with painted figures and dungeon stone floor modules. If you don't take things too seriously and avoid getting bogged down coordinating optimum moves, it can be a fun, old-school dungeoncrawl. I'm not convinced expansions make it any better. I've had he most fun with the smaller, fan-submitted scenarios from the FFG website that play fast and don't overstay their welcome. Even with rules-savvy, shoot-from-the-hip players the first scenario took us five hours to complete ... not a problem in and of itself, as it didn't FEEL like five hours and was a completely rewarding session, but blocks of time that large are hard to come by.

While I've enjoyed my plays of this game, I think that it is more for the dungeon crawling experience than for intellectual experience.  Also, this has played far longer than I would have thought.  Granted that we were playing with a larger group and we were new, but I wasn't expecting a five-hour game.

After several plays, this game just doesn't do anything for me.  I didn't like the one-versus-everybody else aspect, the continual respawn of monsters, and the extremely slow rate of progression and improvement.

RATING: 7
I've played this several times now and have enjoyed it every time. Offers much more than basic heroquest and I also prefer it to advanced heroquest as it's simpler in many ways but without sacrificing anything from the enjoyment of the gameplay.

The miniatures are excellent and there are lots of bits but I think the price reflects that.

Great fun if you enjoy a good dungeoncrawl game. Hopefully there may be some expansions to keep the interest going though, as, with any game of this type, once you've played all the scenarios the desire to play again diminishes.

Edit: With a whole host of fan-created scenarios available I don't think there will be a problem with replayability.

Edit: Length of set up and play are going to prevent me from choosing to play this very often now I suspect.

RATING: 6
This is one of those dungeon crawling games. Yes, I know. Each of "those" games has a different feel to it, some work better, some not so well. What this one has going for itself is that it has really, really nice components, and that rolling the many coloured dice is fun. I also like that the heroes are quite diverse, have quite a few tactical and equipment options, and I like that the dungeon master has quite the selection of mean stuff up his sleeve - which he cannot necessarily play it as he would like it. 

It's a hack-and-slay dungeon crawl. It's far from bad at that, but it's also not the most exciting implementation of it. The rule for (teleporting into town from the dungeon) and buying stuff seems a tad unrealistic. Also, the fact that the dungeon master's best action - respawning monsters in unobserved spots of the dungeon - can be severely restricted by heroes who have famililars (and know how to use them to that end), seems quite unbalanced. 

What always gnaws at me whenever I play one of these games is the question why I don't rather play a real RPG. If the game were real quick, it wouldn't matter that much, but it strives to be as facetted as possible for the hero players, which ends up being quite time consuming, while the pay off is insubstantial. I would recommend this one specifically for people in their early teens who might use it as kick off into playing RPGs.

Excellent dungeon crawl! A bit tough with two heroes versus the overlord (OK, more than a bit tough). It's a time sink though, unless you have a day set aside, you're going to need to leave this set-up (unless of course the heroes get rapidly crushed!)

My rating might be higher if I didn't have to always be the Overlord and always teach the game to new players.  That gets old.  Good game that is a pretty nice offspring of Heroquest and Warhammer Quest.  I'm surprised at how many "lighter" gamers seem to enjoy playing this, even with its long length.  I might personally have more fun if I got to play a hero every once in a while.  :)

RATING: 7
Disappointing (after 3 games).  Basic idea of the game is nice.  Components are great but two things are seriously bugging me: 

First of all, the Overlord seems to have a severe disadvantage if the heroes are played properly.  As soon as the first major treasure is looted, all monsters but the most powerful are simply cannon fodder which makes many Overlord cards more or less worthless.  As the OL you either win in the first half of the game or you lose.  This wouldn't be a problem if the overall game time wouldn't be so long.  Which brings me to the second problem:

The second problem is the playing time.  Descent *needs* a group of players who think and act *fast*.  Otherwise it is a nightmare.  My group plays very slow.  After more than 6 hours of play, the Overlord (me) had about 40 minutes of playtime whereas the heroes had used more than 5 hours (in which I had nothing to do other than stare at the wall and listen to endless discussions).  This is most probably a problem with my group rather than with the game but be warned: if your group is slow, expect a game of Descent to drag and drag and drag ...

Edit: Raised rating from 6 to 7 after a game with my 10 year old nephew which was tremendous fun.  Apparently this game needs a group who doesn't overanalyze everything.

Probably my favorite of the dungeon crawl games (and I have a TON of them!)  The fact that the overlord actually PLAYS the game rather than DMing it is a great idea in my book; and gives it decent replayability.  Lots of user scenarios have been made for it too.  I've even started building some paper terrain for it!

RATING: 10
Tentative rating. It has lots of things that I love in a game: modular board, variable player powers, tons of dice, great figures, and the ability to get cool stuff as the game goes on. It also has some things that I do not like in a game such as 4-hour length and the need for an overlord. I have fun playing, but I'm not sure how much fun I would have being the overlord. It strikes a good balance of chance and strategy for me, but you almost don't notice because you are just having fun killing stuff. More plays will allow me to solidify this a bit more I think. 
UPDATE: I cannot get enough. It's sucking me in. Looks to be a Top 10 contender by year end, but I am withholding judgement in case it's just new game euphoria.
UPDATE: Wouldn't you know it; being the overlord is not only not a drawback, it's actually pretty dang fun. Actually, basically everything about this game is fun. It's still long; a "weekend only" sort of game, but it is just the right length for what it is.

Aah, Descent. If only it didn't take so much time ... but then, if it didn't, it would miss half the chrome that makes it so splendid to look at. All these great monsters and dungeon tiles and floor tiles and tokens and counters and cards and bits and pieces and chits ... it's a great view to behold.

The gameplay is pretty good, too, although meanwhile I'm attracted to ... slightly less over-the-top chrome. The main disadvantage is that setup takes a long while, and then playing the game can take a long while as well due to both AP and the GM (well, OL) having to pick all the right monsters and cards and effect tokens when they're needed. Requires a well-organized game box.

The game does get better with more expansions, the main sad thing about these is that they're all meant to be playable with only the base game and one expansion ... consequently, there are precious few places (even with RtL and SoB) where monsters and pieces from all the expansions are needed together. In fact, bar the Quest Companion, I don't think I recall one official scenario with bits from all the expansions.

Which is a bit of a pity.

Anyway, if you're looking for a dungeon crawl and have plenty of time to spare, this is the game you want. Despite sometimes gaping imbalances (mostly fixed by the various FAQ though) and long playing time, Descent is a very awesome experience overall, with mechanics that exactly match the theme's requirements for furious and savage action.

Play warhammer quest for some fun monster slaying, or if you have time enough to play Descent, then play a full blown fantasy rpg.

DOOM in the RUNEBOUND universe.  It is an interesting tactical combat game in an adventure setting.  The game can take some time to complete (4 - 6 hours) and I don't particularly like the GM drawing cards and "preparing" traps for you by spawning in front and behind your party.  Like DOOM, in that you need to keep pressing forward, else you'll loose.

I would have prefered some sort of event deck which gets triggered randomly, and where all players are playing together.

A faux-RPG version of Doom - what's not to like?  Well, I've only played this game with the Road to Legend expansion in a campaign format so I can't say too much about the base game.

I think I'd like a nice 4-6 hour session that's different each time though rather than a bunch of 2+ hour sessions of slowly trudging through a campaign.  Time will tell as we venture further in.

Two of my pet obessions combined in one monstrous box - dungeon crawling and campaign based gameplay.  How could I resist?

I've been undecided as to whether I want to play this before painting the minis.  I'd usually just paint them but.... the sheer number of them is frankly terrifying.

I'll probably get a few games going and see how popular it proves.  If it seems like I'll be able to get it to the table fairly frequently then I'll buy one of the campaign expansions and dig the paintbrushes out.

For now: unplayed and unrated.

I don't get why Descent is seen as a "heavy" game. I like it but the choices for the heroes aren't hard, as overlord you need to attack often and early. it does take an awful long time to play even 2er but it isn't heavy. and there is the problem that I have with Descent, if I want to play a four to five hour game I much rather play something meatier.

Not a bad dungeon crawl. In typical Fantasy Flight fashion, the game is as carefully balanced as the Tower of Pisa. Fortunately, the game has enough decisions in it to make it entertaining.

The game is more expensive than it seems at first glance: The insert is awful, and there are so many little counters that you might need at any given time that little plastic bags aren't that great an idea. To keep the game even remotely organized, you'll have to buy at least a couple of tackle boxes.

I'd rate it higher if it didn't take an entire evening to finish a game. Even long games like Magic Realm and Die Macher seem short compared to this.

Played half a game once.  For whatever reason it makes everyone's eyes bulge out of their heads when they see the massive spray of bits, cards, dice, minis, markers, chits, placeholders, status indicators, and funny-shaped cardboard nib-nobs.  And then they expect me to know all the rules.  By myself.

"Here's a rule for ya—you're dead!  I win!"

UPDATE:  In the end I'm just not a fan of tactical dungeon combat.  I love dungeon crawls—just with the combat and movement more abstracted.  [i]Descent[/i] goes into a level of detail I find laborious.  It is, by all appearances, a great game, and if I had a rabid group of players who dug it I'd go to the effort of learning and playing it.  With no one clamoring for it, it'll have to anchor my game shelves until such a crowd forms...

First impressions are very postitive.  We played though an introductory custom scenario to get the hang of the game and learn the basic gameflow.  I must say that I already like it much better than Arkham Horror.  I like the way dices are used in Descent -- one roll shows everything you need to know about the battle outcome.  The first game was tense.  We made lots of mistakes on the way and had many questions concerning basic rules, but overall it was a great experience.  The game took 3 hours (for a small 4-room map), but the time flew and we were involved all the time. Once we finished, we could not believe that three hours had passed - it seemed like an hour.  Really engaging game.  

I like the customization factor and the fact that each game is different thanks to different selection of heroes, initial skills, found items, etc.

Ambitious but dissapointing.  Descent was my first taste of FF games that needed you to herd four people together to have any chance at all of winning.  I've never expected an opponent to pull punches until I played Descent.  If you enjoy losing like me and BB King then give this one a few nights.  If you like to exploit the rules to win this one is also for you.  Personaly I like both of these things just ask the Flint Michigan Fire department, if you want balance without having to buy a half dozen folding chairs avoid this one.  -H7

One player is the DM, the others all play heroes, and the DM must try for a TPW. With simple rules for movement, attacking, and items, the party moves through the modular dungeon tiles, set out by the DM as per the scenario, and monster spawn, along with treasures, as the party moves throughout.  The DM gains power with each turn, the heroes with each small victory, and the dungeon's end signals the loss of all items. What?  Until you play the campaign expansion, it's always a one-off adventure, with rules for "leveling" up characters in between (items are still lost, however).

After repeated plays, the game has started to grow on me.  I still have issues with some of the fiddliness...the time it takes to figure out how much damage you have done (dice,hero abilities, character traits, surges), the number of tokens the game can require at different times during the game...as well as the game length of the official scenarios (4 hours or more).  But if you've got the time, and the right group (one who doesn't shy away from tracking several levels of info on a given turn), you've got an enjoyable gaming experience waiting for you.

Great fun!  Definitely the best of the dungeon crawl games that I've played.  While there are a lot of rules, the rule book is fairly well laid out and the rules cover most of the situations that arise.  I think Descent is better as an "experience" game than a competitive game.  I'll admit that I certainly take pleasure in thwarting the players wandering my dungeons, but I care much less whether I win or lose than I do in most games.

This was a good dungeon crawl of a game.  A bit too long, or it'd be a ten.

After playing some other dungeon crawl games, I figure this one just takes to damn long.  And, it really seems to favor the players vs. the overlord.

I had a blast playing this for the first time but it revealed it´s imbalance quiet fast. 
It just takes like forever and there is not much tention.
I have to be really in the right mood to play this.
I would like to try the Legends expansion as lot of people say it makes single games shorter and allows development of heroes.

We play Descent at lunch time when running our school holiday program, Kraftworks for Kids. The program is for kids aged 9 - 14. The kids really enjoy this game. We pair up the beginners with one of the Leaders while those who have played a few games are able to play without assistance. Sometimes we don't finish the game by the end of lunch but it can easily be resumed at the end of the day while waiting for parents to arrive. Lots of fun!

RATING: 8
Excellent core game that launched a franchise and showed a new era gaming market what kind of enormous value and imagination could be packed into one box. Original appeal was a light weight dungeon crawler alternative to a full RPG with lots more visual appeal (and therefore friendlier to a broader audience). This was one game that inspired me to get back into tabletop gaming and illustrated the "across the board" improvements in print quality, 3D components, storytelling in a modern tabletop game.  Fantasy Flight continues Descent's evolution with 2nd Edition which aimed to furnish a cleaner rule system to allow for quicker set up and play vs. 1st Ed. At the same time 2nd Ed broadened possibilities for player choice and customization. Backward compatible conversion kit exists for 1st Ed core and expansions so I always encourage folks to pick up older 1st Ed stuff on the cheap if they can find it (including this core box). Worthwhile purchase. Recommend.

There's fun in this box, but unfortunately somebody has to be the punching bag.  I can't imagine I'd want to play it every week but I'm quite pleased that we have it now and think I'll enjoy it when we do play. Is this a function of theme and atmosphere?  Maybe.  Or maybe I just like gathering stuff and playing around with the minis. Melee seems a bit overpowered, and sometimes the game can take a long time. However, the best way to combat this is with LESS SHOPPING.  Tried it with no shopping and it seriously just pushed the game's rating back up to a seven.

A great dungeion crawl, we (or at least the players have)  have gotten a bit stuck on mission 6. I always end up playing the overlord it would be nice to play as a hero eventually.
update: well 20-30 plays on all I can say is descent is a rare, perhaps flawed masterpiece. It provides the ultimate hack and slash game, combined with RtL it leaves most RPGs to shame in this category, sure it has no roleplaying, but if you want to bash monsters in dungeons look no further.

RATING: N/A
Adventure games are my favorite category (specifically fantasy adventure) and I also love dungeon crawls. I have spent a long time trying to find the perfect game for me in this category and I feel that Descent may be a strong contender, it will take a few plays to find out.I do know for certain that it is going to be a favorite in any case.

RATING: 8
Good fun. The components and dice used for combat are superb.The box size and game length are not. It's a pity magic is just another type of ranged weapon and that characters can die mulitple times. It's a fun weekend game, but not practical for our regular games nights.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I have never yet to play Descent as a hero player and I really don't care. I own every expansion to this lovely piece of bloody hack-and-slash art, and especially with the Road to Legend add-on (it adds a whole another dimension to the game with a world map, more rpg elements, Overlord avatar characters and campaign play) being the bad guy has never been this fun on board (and unlike in Doom:tBG, the heroes do give me a run for my money!). The only negative side of this game is the duration that can easily climb up to six hours and beyond (and this is for one dungeon, not the campaign of course), but other than that, this is the perfect fantasy action board RPG! 

Now, you'll have to excuse me, I have to observe my right hand man sir Alric and his beast-man minions stomp Frostgate to dust... Unless the heroes try to stop them... In which case, I will have a surprice prepared for them... Hahaha...!

Currently painting the minis. Very slowly.

I really enjoy playing as the overlord (much more than I expected to when I bought the game).

Descent is one of my wife's favorite games.  Wahoo!

--update august 15, 2011--

Still painting the minis. Still very slowly.

As I'm coming up on a quarter of games of this, I'm becoming comfortable enough to start removing a few things from skill decks and treasure decks that just aren't fun or at all valuable. I've house ruled a few things here and there, and I've started thinking about a few things that I'd like to change up a bit. With all the changes, I'm not sure exactly how to rate this. Out of the box? With my changes?

I think as long as I'm still playing the core game (that is to say, without any dramatic changes to what a player does in a turn and with the same goals still in mind), I have to rate this as I play it. So here's a 9 for you, Descent (though out of the box, it really wouldn't be too much lower).

First played this on April 25th, 2007.  We didn't get to play too long since we were learning how to play and referring to the rules.  Our game master had played before, however he still had to refer to the manual about every other question.  That should give you some idea of how complex this game was.  It's very difficult to learn and it will take a long time to play.  I heard a rumor that the game itself is $70-80.  Hmmm... If you are lucky enough to know someone that has it and will teach/walk you through it, then go for it.  It does look exciting and fun to play.  Having said that, I don't know when I'll get an opporotunity to play it again and may not ever get to play a full game due to time constraints.

RATING: 8
Basically an advanced Hero Quest with many more variations available. Number of players doesn't affect gameplay too much. Needs more RPG elements and some of the rules/items are a bit broken for game balance, but overall almost always fun if someone else is setting up the board.

Big first edition box.  Played twice.  Very disappointed by this expensive game.  I'm an old school role-player with 30+ years experience with rpgs.  Descent is a pale shadow of the fun rpgs offer.  If I want to dungeon crawl, I'd far sooner role-play in a nice rich flexible campaign world than play this.

Great game that meets role playing and board gaming right in the middle.  The problem is convincing either side to compromise what they love best about their side in order to meet in the middle without being disappointed.  But then there are a few gamers that this is their perfect balance.

RATING: 7
Enjoy playing as the evil guy, but gets old being evil all the time, with no friends... although still love it.  Only complaint about it is, since it's supposed to be like a new Hero Quest, wish the board was solid, a pain having to put every piece every time.

I traded this fpr the lighter Descent 2 experience which fits a bit better into my current gaming group.
I loved this very much but it had some serious rules flaws when combined with some expansions. Also the minis aren't state of the art anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Descent adds a lot to the Doom concept that both help and hinder the design.  I give it a big bonus for player customization and a slight mark off for preset-up dungeons (it tends to drag down the flavor of exploration and adventuring).  I think the main problem I had with the game was the time requirement, which added another two full hours onto a standard Doom fare of three.

Update:  After playing with the horribly implemented expansion Well of Darkness, I realized the specific points in Descent that I feel are inferior to Doom.  First off there's too big a gap between levels of combat.  Basically, you either smash a monster to bits or can't hurt it at all.  Secondly, the traps aren't strategic.  They just rain down wounds from the sky and there's little to nothing you can do about it.  Thirdly, there's no fight or flight decision.  You are basically forced to fight everything since it is as fast or faster than you are which brings me to the last point: too many spawns.  There are just far too many creatures that can spawn which often creates a situation of zero mobility and stalls out the game for long periods of time.  I'd still play the base game if offered even knowing these potentially fatal flaws, but I would hesitate to implement the WoD expansion.

RATING: 8.5
Unlike D&D and other traditional pen and paper RPGs which are primarily story driven, Descent: JitD is a competitive contest between a team of heroes and an evil Overlord controlling the dungeon.  If you try to play Descent like a traditional RPG, you will be disappointed.  In order to get the most enjoyment from the game, each team (heroes vs. Overlord) must be as ruthless as possible.  This keeps games moving quickly and reduces frustration.  No one likes to have their obvious defeat dragged out for another hour.
That said, time consumption is one of the biggest drawbacks of the game.  It takes about 30 minutes to setup if you are super organized and then takes about 4-6 hours to complete a single quest.  It is good fun, but you have to commit an entire evening to one game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I will play this game any day. Adrenaline-pumping quests where monsters spawn constantly and you have to keep moving. You get better with more weapons and loot, and the campaign expansions are epic. I think it can be frustrating as a true competitive game (especially the campaign), so as a "competition game" I give the base set a 7/10 and the expansions a 5/10 or less. But play it a bit more like a GM to give the heroes a chance when they struggle and it can be a lot of fun - a 10/10 "experience." I think the second edition is a better game, if the goal is to play competitively, but this one is a more fun experience for me when the OL is willing to lighten up from time to time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Only downside is that the OL has to prolong the already long game to win.  Otherwise WOW on the bits, scenarios, characters, and FUN

Rasied to a 10 because of Road to Legend.

RATING: 7
Never believe anyone who tells you that it is an adventure game. It is not. It is an uforgiving tactical miniatures game, with a relatively significant luck factor. The first mistake might be your last here. And, in fact, it usually is.

As from now on I have the game for sale. I mean to sell it with the WoD, AoD and RtL expansions and my storing solution (a sturdy case, plastic containers and card sleeves, plus two expansion boxes to store the cards and floors) as a set. The price is close to what you get in a shop but it includes all the high-quality storing stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
i give this game an '8' as playing the Overlord. I think the Overlord has a lot of options and what happens in the game really flows through his turn. His decisions and timing aren't always easy. So far I have enjoyed being the Overlord much more then being the heroes. The heroes' turns seem much more about hack and slash, etc. and aren't as interesting. From the hero's perspective I'd give this game a '6'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The ultimate Dungeon Crawl with additional fun for the DM/Overlord as opposed to being just a facilitor.
I have played it infrequently but I just love it enough to keep buying the expansions regardless.

Rating dropped slightly as I found my recent game to be slow in getting started and fiddly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Ideal Players: 4-5

Description: Dungeons and Dragons style dungeon crawling, minus that annoying talking and traveling in between dungeons.

Pro: Captures the essence of D&D combat. Great if you feel like killing something. Cool dice mechanics with range, hits, and surges in different probability on different color dice. Great cooperative experience.

Con: Random dice rolling largely determines success. Requires one player to be the Dungeon Master, fighting against the other players (could be accomplished through rules for how monsters act). Not much strategic depth or creativity with spells.

Initially rated it about a 5 - i.e. ok but nothing special.  After a few more games I am trading it away.  It's too long and holds no lasting excitement.  I think roleplayers may get more mileage out of it although one of my players was an RPGer and he didn't like it much either.

a somewhat fiddly fantasy adventure game.  it fits the miniture rpgs niche that i want but lacks the finely tune gameplay needed to give the players the feeling of an epic adventure.  too many playing pieces for the players to keep track of and game is heavily in the favor of melee heroes. the game is too easy for the heroes unless they picked out crappy starting heroes or the overlord quickly disposes of them early in the game but that would piss off the gamers who spent the time to setup the game! great mini's but unless you're into games with lots of bits be cautious of this title

Components are marvellous, but.

We found the game-play repetitive and the game itself unbalanced, tedious and too long. I was not disappointed though, for I expected as much from the reviews here on the geek. I bought it together with Road to Legend, because from what I read about the alleged flaws of that expansion, it is probably just right up our alley.

Edit (after playing Road to Legend): Rating not changed for the base game, obviously, but in combination with RtL it IS indeed right up our alley. Marvellous!

I'm split on this one.  First of all, I love the game.  The pieces, the one vs everyone else, the fight together or die alone mentality of it.  The problem is that it is too big for what it is.  Games can easily go 6 hours if it is a bigger board, and it eventually just becomes a grind.  

I think i would enjoy this a little more if there were less monsters in the game, but they were much more powerful.  A dragon that is 15 times the size of the plastic hero should not die before getting an attack.  Every time I've played the heroes just seem over-powered for what they face in the maze.

Edited:  It seems like I am getting what I wanted with the Road to Legend expansion with slightly more powerful foes and weaker beginning heroes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game is *huge* and weighs a ton!  You get an enormous amount of high-quality bits and map parts with this game.  This game is similar to HeroQuest in that there is a "game master" that plays the role of the monsters on the board.  Unlike HeroQuest, the game master could be considered a player; he can purchase and play cards to hurt the the other players, and will lose the game if the other players win.  This would be a great game if the play time was about 1/2 as long; part of the reason why this game is so long is that the game master can annoyingly spawn creatures every two or three turns, slowing down progress for the players.  This game is also a little fiddly as well.  I prefer Doom to Descent because Doom is more streamlined and also has a shorter playing time.

Another good crawl experience like Doom.  However, I don't like the theme as well as doom's, and I thought the additional chrome added on top of that already found in Doom might have been a little too much stuff just for the sake of adding stuff.  I realize that for some people the addition of a myriad of fantasy characters and entire decks of items adds a lot to the game.  However, I am not a role-player, and the decks of equipment seem to add little to my  enjoyment of the game.

However, while not as tense and focused as Doom, this is still a very enjoyable crawl.

I could be convinced to play this if all involved were merciless min-maxers, but far too often the players attracted to this type of game are socialisers, achievers, and explorers; not killers. I prefer first edition for the ability to play a single game without needing to be tied to a campaign

A little hard for me to rate this since the only time I played was with RTL and with it, it was quite good. The main game is mostly the same and I liked it a good bit but rate RTL higher, below are my comments for that game which largely apply here also:

------------------------------------------------------

initial rating 1 play so far

As a long time D&D player I was quite looking forward to just regular Descent for some time and when I read about the RTL expansion I had to try it asap. I never did play the original alone so I won't be able to comment on the improvement that it obviously makes. I also have only played one other real Dungeon crawl boardgame which was Heroquest. No comparison to make there, HQ is very dated and really suited for ages 7 to 12 IMO. End of Disclaimer. 

This was a pretty enjoyable  system to play so far. I really liked how you had one main board as the 'world' you are in and to explore so to speak, and then encounters were fought off that board onto a whole new board which is the same kind of modular type dungeons as the original(so I was told).

I was a little disapointed with the characters limited abilities, attributes etc coming from D&D however there were choices to be made on a starting character and then equipment and also skills as well with more skills being able to be purchased in the future. 

The big appeal to the expansion other than what I think I mentioned above is of course the shorter play time and ability to easily save a game and come back to it later, one of the reasons I never rushed to play the original, if I had 4 or 5 hours to spare I might as well play D&D. Well this is a great feature and they have even included "tuck boxes" for each character and the DM so you can pack away all your currect health, skills, potions, whatever you have and then just easily open it up and dump it out next time ready for play. 

I like the idea of competing against a 'live person' which is obviously more challenging than random encounters or the like however I still really have to play Warhammer Quest as I have read a lot of good things about it and it looks to play well with only 2 players (I beleive you can have a DM or also have the option to NOT have one as well). Could be the only other real competition for this now along with maybe Magic Realm. 

Looking forward to more plays

RATING: 9
Everything I wanted in a dungeon crawl: hero progression, standalone dungeons, loot, actual decisions to be made each round, surprises for the heroes. The one vs. all drags it down a bit but I still prefer the standalone dungeons over the campaign-driven 2nd edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I hate this game with 5 players, and enjoy it thoroughly with 2-3.  With five players, your turns come too slowly, the difficulty is all off, and it was just a dull game.  With two or three, the game is more difficult, you have more to do on your turn, and your turns come a lot faster.  I'd give this a 4 rating with five players, and an 8 or 9 with two or three players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.1
Excellent game. I don't mind the length as some do, it cut too many corners to shorten game play time and I can appreciate that. It's VERY similar to Doom, at least at it's core and I do like this slightly more than Doom. 

I can also see why some people may prefer this dungeon crawl over Runebound. My games of Runebound (and I use all the expansion I can) end of with me having more cards than I know what to do with. I think the basic movement of Descent is just so much better than Runebound lousy movement system, my one major gripe with RB. However I really enjoy the character development of RB.  I would love to try Descent as a campaign even though we couldn't even get though my first game.  

All in all, if I had to choose all over...Runebound and all of it's expansions or Descent and all of it's expansions, I'd have a very difficult time choosing. I also own Doom, which influences my desire to own Descent.  It's worth owning, there's no doubt about that, it's just that owning Doom I have the core mechanics covered and owning Runebound scratches my dungeon crawl itch. 

UPDATE:  Yeah it's a great game but I'm bumping the rating down a bit more.  It's becuase a number of games have come such a Ravenloft and Thunderstone that further scratch the dungeon crawl itch without going on all day.

This looks like a pretty good game, but the first game I played dragged on for hours. We lost and the scenario conditions seemed onerous. The scenario had us carry a Cursed sword that had to be used, wasn't very good in combat (it would get better the further you explored, but we never got far enough to make much difference.), and continually sapped the health of the holder every turn he failed to kill and enemy. Since the DM continually ran off with the weaker mobs this made the game long and wearisome.

Just delivered, still counting/verifying contents (purchased used, but great shape - wow, LOTS of content to inventory!)  Hopefully have a chance to play with it a bit and get an initial rating in here - though I may be somewhat disappointed, as I initially thought the game would have more solo potential.  I think there's some in the variants section though - have to check it out!

Not my type of game in general, but my  one experience with it was reasonably fun. I very much have to be in the right mood to play this again, though, since the fun element is very much the social interaction with the other players, rather than the game itself.

My biggest criticism is the game's focus, which is centered too much on repetitive monster-bashing, and too little on actual exploration and excitement in general (at least the scenario we played - scenario 3). Nice components generally, although with too pulpish artwork for my tastes. The map tiles are pretty garish also.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (January 2012)

I played Descent: Journeys in the Dark a long time ago, so I don’t remember all the game nuances. 

I remember I thought the game´s miniatures were very impressive, along with Doom´s, one of the best I have seen at the time. I also remember I thought the game to be very long for what it offered. I don’t mind long games, but Descent becomes repetitive rather soon. In theory I love that the Overlord has to setup each room when a hero reaches it, but in practice this adds to the playtime and it becomes tedious after doing it a lot of times.

At the time, I thought the game was great, perhaps the best dungeon crawler ever made but I have changed a lot in these four years. I have drifted away from Ameritrash games and now I enjoy more Eurogames, due to this, I’m downgrading Descent’s rating to one that matches my current feelings for the game with BGG´s rating system.

Bottom line, my previous self, loved the game, but my current self don’t want to play Descent: Journeys in the Dark, mainly because it requires a long of time to play it and it is very repetitive. I bought a couple of expansions in the past years, but I already sold them.

Current Rating: 5.0

RATING: 7
In the dungeon crawl, tactical miniature RPG genre, I think its the best.  Somewhere in between RPG and boardgames, it often makes neither side happy.  The role of the Overlord makes the game work but very rarely requested in my group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I can't really decide what to make of this game.  On one hand, it delivers as a dungeon romp.  On the other, it seems to end just as it gets going -- I'd like to do a little more with the treasures once I get them, and a campaign mode would be great.  I'm sure for many the chance to be turned into a monkey is fun, but for me it's frustrating, as are all other turn-loss mechanics in games.  I've only played as a PC, not the overlord.  I probably never will play as overlord, since that's a much sought-after role whose disposition tends to come down to a power struggle among the players before the game.

Edit:  Reminder to self to try out RTL sometime, since I've mused about wanting to play a campaign.

RATING: 8
Damn fun fantasy game. 

Doom was high on my list, but I went with this one instead. Great bits, great production, and a dang good game. 

Plays pretty smooth when you get going and players interested in the genre have a lot of fun working together in their clearly flawed attempts at thwarting my evil intentions; these pathetic, little, dungeeoneers have no chance against my evil genius! *insert evil laugh here*

Very cool. Very happy. Play and go for it.

RATING: 9
A quicker and easier dungeon crawling game than an actual TRPG. It doesn't mean it's a simple game but just when comparing to TRPG. It can be a rich role playing game with lower barriers and more visual. Well-planned team work is necessary in gaming strategy. Plenty of sculpts are worth the spent money. Painting them if you could is even better.

I've rated this game a 6.0 due to always having to be the overlord (it is a difficult role and I get stuck doing it).  Also, the amount of setup time (both pre-game and during) each game takes is tedious.

I play with my 10 year old son - we had wanted to get into roleplaying together, but our schedule doesn't work for keeping a group thing going, and I am a terrible gm.

Love roleplaying. This is a boardgame with a gamemaster. It's a bit like a roleplaying game. Except, there is no roleplaying. It's one looooong battle, and its boooring.

28.10.2009: If the game was shorter I would rate it higher. This is a game I should like, since I'm a D&D player, but it's just too long. Perhaps it's just the players who have analysis paralysis.

I kind of got burnt out on this one, only after purchasing the first 4 expansions and making it 1/2way through two differnt RtL campaigns of course. The tactics with guard orders, special abilities, fatigue mechanic, etc. , the interesting dice and overlord cards are all pretty neat, as are the miniatures, but there is definitely something lacking. The game feels pretty unbalanced most of the time, and in the RtL campaign player deaths don't even seem to matter. I often find myself wishing I could come up with a better set of rules to make this the ultimate adversarial dungeon crawler.

Still, Descent reminds me a lot of playing Heroquest as a kid, and definitely hits a lot of the right notes.

Very solid and fun dungeon crawl game. The play time is a little longer than would be ideal. It seems a bit more complicated than it should be to shuffle items between your characters. As long as new scenarios continue to be published, replayability should not be an issue.

RATING: 7.5
As a big Runebound fan I was familiar with the universe and a lot of the conventions. FFG does a good job distilling D&D into a boardgame experience as they did in Runebound, although here they focus more on the co-op and tactical/spatial combat elements and of course the dungeon crawler theme, whereas RB focused more on the story arc/adventuring/questing/larger world elements. I like the way they've handled Overlord rules, so that it's a battle of wits as he tries to defeat the heroes. The length will keep me from playing this more than a couple times a year, but, it's still nice to be able to get a D&D experience in just a single session.

A great dungeon-crawl game with the feel of an RPG--complete with models.  I remember TSR's DUNGEON boardgame from the 80s & how much my gaming group loved it then.  DESCENT is so much better & exactly the game we dreamed about way back when.  Not only are there pre-set adventures, the game is versatile enough for players to come up with their own.  I'm sure my rating score of "8" will get higher when I play it again with better gamers who appreciate the game's mechanics & want something else than another pencil, paper & dice chucking RPG.

Might fix the balance issues of Doom, but the game is still too long with a paucity of real decisions to make.  Seems to me you could play a dungeoncrawl rpg for the same investment of time and energy - and have a lot more fun doing it.  On the boardgame front, offerings like Siege of the Citadel are more attractive since they play faster and better.

Complete 1st edition Descent up for trade. I want to trade it all as one set. The only box I have is Road to Legend.

I'd probably rate this higher, if I could actually get it on the table more often :) I like D&D a lot and this is a quick game in comparison, but it does take a large time commitment, compared to board games in general.  I still haven't tried out all the characters, but the treasure deck is a known quantity.  I tend to like playing characters over running the adventure, but that can be a lot of fun, too.  I really want to get the expansions, to discover new goodies, and to try out new scenarios.

RATING: 3
My group loves this game. Balance is a little tricky but it plays brilliantly. Game can take a little long to play (3+ hrs) but we don't care. I like being a hero or the Overlord. Being a good Overlord takes a little practice though. The Hero party plays like a Dungeon SWAT team. If you're looking for an RPG/RPG lite you'll be disappointed. Great monsters, plenty of community support, great scenario editor for endless creation of new scenarios. I love this game!
10th Jan 2011 Update - If you're after an RPG lite then buy the Road to Legend expansion. Brilliant!
19 Dec 2012 Update - Unfortunately, this hasn't hit the table in a long time. Road to Legend is way too long. Have upgraded to Descent 2nd Ed. and am much happier

This game severely maims the Dungeon Master (overlord). After all the hard work of putting the game together and setting up the scenario, she/he gets pounded, maimed, and pounded some more. Rules are wacked with 2 or 4+ heroes. Not to mention, "Hello insta-teleport to town and heal to max health for pennies!"

Reminds me of my craving for Dungeon and Dragons, but this game falls way short in excitement, due to its pure and truly mundane hack and slash nature. 

No traits besides "hack" and "slash". [b]Absolutly ZERO character development or negotiations or puzzles. [/b]There's a lot better games out there. This one isn't worth my money or time. And I definitly won't recommend it to you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Love the game, but think it takes too long to play. I do! I really do love the way this game plays! Character management and development is a lot of fun, and playing the Overlord is all about devious ways to destroy the heroes. I love the fantasy setting, and the scope for development and expansions for the game, but I really do think it takes too long to play...

RATING: 5
Too many abilities, too many side-rules, too many tokens, too many things to keep in mind bogs down this otherwise beautiful game. Even the simplest scenario took us 5 odd hours. A pity because I see so much potential in the game. But I find the fantasy aspect is overwhelmed by the bulky ruleset.

Mindless dungeon crawl with no hint of realism. Monsters either too weak or too powerful, magic items often too powerful. Could be fixed.

There's a good game in here I know it, but it needs to be more "Heroquest" adventure (as it stands it's ALL combat) and less "Doom the boardgame" spawn/frag-athon.

RATING: 8
Only played once but I enjoyed it.  Every room felt like the heroes had no chance and every move was desperate and I really enjoyed that aspect.  It did feel like the overlord had to hold back because he could have wiped out the heroes at any time and certainly if he focuses on one hero then that hero will die quickly.  But if you get the right overlord this game would be fun over and over again.

RATING: 7
Excellent game, it brought me back to my beloved Hero Quest.

RATING: 5
Dungeon crawl where player characters better themselves through the acquisition of gear from chests that the monsters have left lying about. Conflict resolution is reasonably quick and gratifying (rolling many dice is fun), but the goal of a fast pace is often undermined through tactical deliberations, the use of Diabloesque town portals and trade, and the critical importance of determining line of sight to every god-forsaken corner. Completing the first scenario with five players (of which only the Overlord was familiar with the game) and minimal spawning took some five hours, which is a bit much for something that, viewing the events from the perspective of the hero players, could have happened in the span of minutes in a computer game, and in an RPG would be looked back on by many as a bad session. Also I can imagine that it would be stunningly anticlimactic if the Overlord ever won, but from what I read that tends to happen early or not at all.

Enjoyable dungeon romp with some absolutely bizarre rules (mass treasure awards, instant repeat resurrections, and it's nearly impossible to miss with a bow unless you're firing from about 12 spaces away). There are a few ugly balance issues with this one (too hard with 2 heroes, not enough challenge with 4... go figure). It's a dungeon crawl filmed in slow-motion. Somebody dropped me a note when the thing is fixed.

RATING: 10
Rated after many plays:
This, for me, is a near perfect adventure game. The "fun-factor" makes it a 10.  Suspense: a real feel of a group trying to accomplish some task, danger, difficulty, great loot, great and endless possibilities.  It has everything.  It feels alot like AD&D to me, without all of the "out of combat" stuff.  I love that stuff and will play D&D for that.  For a dungeon crawl, for combat with some story and flavor, give me Descent! 
It has the unfortunate possibility of being difficult to hit the table...some say "too long"
I personally don't care if it did take 16 hours to play...I enjoy it that much. We have been successful at getting our games in around the 3-4 hour mark..of course, we usually lose as the Hero, so they could go longer if we knew what the hell we were doing!!!  :P
This one has jumped to the very top of my all-time lists at this point.  Only Duel of Ages means more to me in my collection of games.  Would play at ANY given moment.

Best of the dungeon romps. Lots of bits & pieces. I mean a LOT. :D Only problem with these games is the gametime. They just take TOO long to complete. Better with the Road to Legend.

If you are in the mood then it is a funny but a bit long dungeon crawler. But be prepared for that even the nastiest Overlord is handicapped against the heroes. 
There are some gaps and inconsistencies in the design. Though these can be addressed by some houserules with ease.

The texts in the Hungarian edition are suffering badly from the lack of a proper proofreading process!

Good game, but the lack of a campaign option keeps it from being a great game.  Warhammer Quest is still tops for dungeon crawling action.

RATING: 6
Dull game. Mostly just too long. First half of the game session is interesting when you're living on the edge between surviving and perishing. After certain point it becomes clear that barring some really unfortunate luck the game cannot beat you anymore but there is still half of the time remaining when you finish the scenario without even a tiny bit of excitement.

A cooperative dungeon hack. This game has a few balance issues, but can be an intense ride! One player is the overlord and the others are adventurers. Descent runs as if one player is a game master (from role playing games). He controls the traps and monsters, but the scenario and map are pre-set.

RATING: 3
Another Fantasy Flight release crippled by fiddly rules and excessively long play-time.  Like so many of their games, I so very much wanted to enjoy Descent when I first saw it: the myriad characters, the huge plastic minis, the neat magical items.  The glamour wore thin by the three-hour mark (incidentally when our party managed to leave the first room).  Another major problem with the game is the 3 player version.  With just two heroes, the Overlord was spawning enemies as fast as we could kill them (four per turn, if we dedicated every action to that end).  The term 'dungeon crawl' described our progress all too accurately.

I love this game and would play it anytime.... though it does have significant flaws.  You can work around them, and I do because I love the game, but there are some issues.  The three biggest ones I think are:

[b]Not everything is balanced[/b] (in a game with this many different options and cards it's kind of hard not to have some amount of imbalance, though I wish there was a lot less) 

[b]No player scaling[/b] (you just always have to play with 4 heroes or use The Enduring Evil mod)

[b]Terrible rules[/b] (seriously they're a mess, but I'm willing to study to try to get them right)

Not sure I will keep this, a nice game but really doesn't fit the time we have available to game these days. I have no idea how I would trade it though. I think I would have to trade it and both expansions at once as the pieces from them are all mixed up in the boxes.

It has given a lot of play time though, much more than 5 plays suggests as we finished one entire road to legend campaign. that alone must have been way more than 100 hours.

I really, really want to like Descent more than I do. Descent has a lot of things going for it that are peripheral to the mechanics of the game itself - an enveloping mood, interesting characters, and a nice, old-school Dungeon Crawl that invokes some of the best D&D games out there.

The problem, though, is that the mechanics deviate so far from the mood that most games I've played of it end in not a sense of accomplishment (like a good D&D dungeon crawl) but in disappointment. In D&D the game-master isn't inherently antagonistic and is almost unlimited in the toolbox s/he can bring; in Descent the game-master is inherently antagonistic (since there is a winner and loser in Descent, unlike D&D). Because these fundamentals are so very different the game leaves a very bad taste in my mouth nearly every time I play it.

This means that, if the Overlord knows what they're doing and is trying to win the game ends up taking a very different form, focused far more on getting treasure, exiting quickly,  and _not_ fighting than on enjoying the scenery and mood which are the best points of the game.

So the game is more fun if it's played like D&D ... which probably means you should just play D&D instead. On the plus side the Descent tiles work great for 4e!

Based on one-play (but I have played Doom once too).  All I'll say is that Doom is better.  Descent has "gang up on the weak guy" syndrome.

RATING: 9
Between the time investment (slow with more than 3 players including the overlord) and the absolute mess on the table, this one just doesn't do it for me.  I also don't really like the looks of the minis as they come in the box, unpainted.  Maybe with a painted set I would change my mind, but I don't need a dungeon crawler with minis as part of my regular rotation.  This game seems to be a favorite with several of my gamer friends, though, and I may end up trying it again one of these days.
*Edit*
Finally tried it again after 3 years and had an absolute blast.  I increased my rating from 5.5 to a 9!  
The scenario we played was exciting, creative, challenging and pretty fast moving with 3 adventurers and an overlord.  
I got over my dislike of the unpainted minis.  They look pretty good and the huge spiders are especially intimidating.  
I guess the big problem is that now I have to seriously consider investing in this beast.  
I have Heroquest already, so maybe in a few years I'll see how my kids go for that game and then spring Descent on them as the next level.

Tactical, Tense, Cooperative, Old School Feel.

Prepare for pain, cause the Dark is not your friend.   I've saw a low rating comment the game was too easy for the players...that would have been the Overlord's fault for taking it easy.  The game can easily be made hard on the players, and it's up to the Overlord to adjust the difficulty.

Another low rating commented on the verbose names...I love the flavor.  I guess some need to stick to Euros with the name only being Armor  3 vs Golden Armor.

I much prefer the 2nd edition rules and system even if there are a few things I wouldn't personally have left behind.  That leaves me pretty indifferent to this original version.  Road to Legend changed the system so much for the better here as well that the base games and first expansions are almost like 1.0 vs Road to Legend 1.5 to Decent 2.0.  So the base game really did need to be redone either way even if you don't agree with how they chose to do so.  I do.

Descent is in my opinion the best "Dungeon Crawl" boardgame available. As far as I heard it becomes even better with the Roads to Legend expansion, which (finally) introduces a good campaign system.
The only downside of this really great game is the amount of space it uses and the length of a session (so I can't play it on thursday evening with my regular gaming group).

I held off on buying this for a while because I figured that I'd just rather play Dungeons & Dragons if I wanted a "dungeon crawl" experience.  Now that I own it, however, what I like best is that it is a purely competitive game between the Overlord and the players, which is a way different thing from RPG's.  Combat is quick and simple, and the game really is a great tactical challenge.  I can't wait to try out the Road to Legend expansion and start a real campaign!

But it is a GREAT dungeoncrawler (best one there is)!

Much toooo easy for the heroes when playing with larger groups (3 or 4 heroes) especially in the first scenarios, but also in most later scenarios. Perhaps much better with the expansions. While I like the game mechanics (which I love in DOOM) I can´t go above 6 because it can be very frustrating for the overlord-player... (and many character abilities have broken combos like we know them only from M:TG TCG - it can be very unappealing for other players when one has such a combo). Moreover the game is very unbalanced in the development of the character levels - at the start very weak, but with the first silver treasure chest the game totally collapses since the heroes always get superior stuff. Often it isn´t important to count the damage but only look if you have hit - and when, with silver items, the enemy is simply dead... so much damage do most of those items...  It´s a kind of "no item = starting character ; one silver item = god mode" ... if you have your first silver items (which happens early enough) the group improves so much the overlord won´t have a real chance anymore...

Descent is basically Doom in a fantasy setting, with more complicated rules. The rules have their ups and downs compared to Doom, the biggest "up" being more flexibility and the biggest "down" being the effect they have on playing time (120 minutes? Get real!). All things considered, it's a great game. I'm a fan of dungeon crawls, and this would be a solid 10 if the playing time was shorter.

An excellent dungeon crawling game, if it only did not take so long.
There is a lot of rules issues, too.

The plastic minis are simply great for any fantasy geek; the modular board and many different hero/skill combinations allow many strategies.

The learning curve is sometimes steep - take care not to discourage the hero players in the first games if you happen to be an experienced OverLord.

I'm getting burnt on this one... any game system where you can do everything right and still have a character killed off in one round of the Overlord is just not that much fun. Heroes can roll multiple 'X' results, and the bad guys come in and do 20+ damage. Ugh. At least in Heroquest, if you were doing poorly, you had the ability to run away and escape with ease. In the second mission (ONLY THE SECOND) there's a medium boss that a hero has to do more than 6 damage in order to even hit him once. THEN he turns around and does a good 7 damage to EACH hero per swing! That's fair? I'm just tired of starting over and over and over and over...
Great combat system, great design, great bits... great everything! But seriously! I want to have fun when I play games, not be eternally frustrated. I blame the quest book, not the game system itself.

This is my original review, which despite my grumblings, still stands:
This is still the best dungeon crawl, overlord vs. player, scenario driven game I've ever played. Any of you that have read my reviews know that I'm easily swayed by imaginative elements in a game--if it makes me feel like I'm transported and in that environment, I'm  happy. So I guess that is why I was so highly impressed... this game OOZES theme. But even more than that. The combat system is incredible. It uses an alternate die format mixed with a battle-stance concept almost like a Magic Realm junior. And the artwork is, like it's brother Runebound, equally incredible. This game replaces the need for any other dungeon crawl and I'm looking forward to any expansion and other online adventures to come.

Fun tactical combat and exploration game. Pros: Compelling combat, varied heros (~20) and monsters with varied powers, good models, good quests often with unique rules or events, heros are never killed off, Hero advancement is well designed.
Cons: Some potential balance issues (I've only played with 2 heros, which gave the overloard a slight advantage, I've heard otherwise the heros can have the advantage.) High level of luck may turn some off who want more skill based gameplay.

RATING: 6
Rating based on three 2-3 player games, and assumes you're my 7-year-old (in which case I'll suggest it); if you're actually [i]you,[/i] I'd call this an 8 (I'll be happy to play it).  So far all of our games have ended in area 1 or 2 of the first quest, which is fine because the 7-year-old is the Overlord.  I do expect this rating to drop some with more plays (or with more players), but we haven't seen all the monsters or items yet, so things are still exciting and new.

Update: dropping this from 10 to 8, as it's just not hitting the table; if we're going to lay out a several-hour game to play in sessions, currently it's Prophecy or Axis & Allies.

Update: dropping this from 8 to 6 after some plays with adults.

I really like dungeon crawlers and Descent is no exception to this. While I don't like it as much as HeroQuest, it does a lot of things right. I especially liked the many different characters and that the game offers a lot of miniatures for a relatively modest price.
But since I#m more into cooperative games these days, Descent doesn't see a lot of play lately, since it focuses so strongly on the competitive fight between the heroes and the overlord.

The game moves much faster as all the players learn the flow of the game and all of the little counters, chits, and markers involved, but a full game will probably still last a few hours.  There's a good amount of fiddliness involved, but the theme is pretty rich, and the active human opponent for the heroes can keep the game pretty challenging and engaging.  While some have complained about slowdown as creatures build up, it seems that good Overlord play will eventually reduce the dependence on small monsters as the game proceeds.  I'd definitely like to try out further scenarios to see how game balance plays out.

My rating probably reflects the enjoyment of my friends, who are bigger dungeon-crawl fans than I am.  The game certainly requires a hefty investment of time, but that doesn't yet seem to discourage repeated play over a short period of time.  There is a little lack of variety for the Overlord player, but the expansions help clear that up.

This can be a very long and involved game the first few times playing it.  The mechanics and logistics can be a bit overwhelming as it is really an RPG made into a board game.  The pieces are fun and very nicely done...there is the dragon of course, some wolfmen, undead skeletons, and a lot of others we didn't see this time around.  There are also a lot of heroes from which to choose.  Potential for very different adventures each play.  Can be fun but very dependent on the crowd...i.e., RPG players or people willing to spend hours on the same boardgame. A bonus if the heroes and Overlord get into their roles!

Thanks to the GM at Total Con 24 for teaching it!

I enjoy Descent. 

It's a tactical Dungeon Crawl that is now starting to border on the realm of a light RPG.

The game has issues, but they don't detract from the fun. Perhaps the weakest part of the game is scenarios - some are better than others and the difficulty can vary but they're still fun especially if you are in to the theme. 

The components used to make this game are really nice, and the price of the game is well worth the quality inside. 

The rules could be organized better, and I do wish that their was a reference sheet for players detailing special abilities that some monsters have.

Unlike Runebound, for example, Descent seems to lack progress. Heroes do not get stronger and whether they are able to get better weapons is wholly dependent on luck. This makes the game a bit boring. On the other hand, I did like the combat mechanism with the different types (colours) of dice.

An excellent, fun co-operative/team dungeon crawler with various different scenarios (or makeup a balanced one of your own).  Some of the elements in Descent remind me of my RPG days.  Expansions give it even more pizazz.  Descent can be easily tailored to your group's tastes...

RATING: 6.5
In enjoyed the fantasy theme more than Doom and found the gameplay to be very similar.  I think the "threat" token mechanic adds to the game (especially to the strategic decision-making of the Overlord).  I don't love the idea of teleporting by glyphs into town to buy provisions, etc. -- that just seems clunky and detracts from the spirit of the quest.  Playing as the Overlord can feel a little boring.

My friends and I played through the entire campaign in short order. Not because the campaign is particularly short, but rather because once we got started, we were pretty much hooked.

While some may berate this game for being a "dumbed down" and more restrictive version of tabletop RPGing, I'd rather point out that this makes it so much more accessible, and at the same time almost as much fun.

Starting out with Descent was a major factor in getting my wife interested in D&D, so consider this a "gateway game" on the way to heavier stuff. That being said, even though my gaming group now mainly focuses on D&D, we still routinely sit down to play a Descent scenario, because it simply offers us a different experience which we enjoy.

RATING: 5
I really wanted to like this game and have a fun dungeon crawl.  Unfortunately, it takes too long to get things done.  It is somewhat unbalanced for parties of less than three or more than three.  The heroes die, often over and over if the villains are successful and just respawn back in town.  The best strategy for the heroes is to run from monsters and just find treasure and glyphs, not fight toe to toe with nasties.  It's the worst of the video and board game worlds mixed together. 
Update: the campaigns have improved the game by letting you play in a shorter time frame and spend a little more time killing valiantly instead of running.

I LOVE THIS GAME =D.
It reminds me of the ps2 games baldur's gate and Champions of Norath because of the dungeon crawling element. I love the figures and the scenarios. There's a huge list of fan made scenarios on fantasy flight's website, just google it. If you love RPGS, you would love this game.

I didn't think I would like this game at all to be honest. What drew me in was the challenge. For a beginner, it was extremely difficult to win the game especially with an extremely evil and unforgiving overlord. However, I've just won my first quest and am already looking forward to the second. But I'm still not sure if the interest will stay especially when it seems like there will be a lot of repeated inventory items, etc.

at last i have a chance to play this game :>
lots of rules and very long game-play (3+ hours per quest), however finishing the quest gives u great accomplishment. I think D&D is a better game cos you get to see your heros mature and develop over time through gaining exp. The heros here are not the average heros we heard of and this make me a little unsatisfised about the game (i want my ELF!!)
the minitures are v.detailed but the over-lord is a bit too powerful

The Rating is based on the game with all expansions (especially the two campains). This game is just epic. With a very good deal of interaction with the other players, solid mechanizms and a fantastic artwork and a hugh number of components, it is a real experience to play that game.

Comments entered on 23 Dec 2009:

Descent: Journeys in the Dark was released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2005. At the time I was a sales associate at FFG. Descent was one of the first new releases that I coordinated sales to distributors. This was an exciting time because Descent was the second "big box" game released by FFG, and there was huge buzz for its release following its introduction at GenCon.

My rating includes a number times that I demo'd this game for FFG. I have managed to play it many times with friends and with my boys. Despite all the different times I've set it up, I have as of yet to play anything except the first two scenarios and a smattering of the encounters from Road to Legend. Even with this "limited" playing, I find the game to be a fantastic example of a tactical miniatures game.

Overall a good game I enjoy playing. There are however certain aspects that keeps me from rating it higher:

- Monster die to quick, no epic battles.
- Heroes tend to be overpowered and impossible to kill about halfway in a quest, making the rest irrelevant.
- Not too much focus on char. dev., would have liked more options there.
- Too long for what it is.

Playing it with the wife and boy, with me as the bad guy.  They become very frustrated - might start giving them some extra goodies to start with until they get the hang of the game.

Have not played for some time now.  The three or so hours required to play is a LOT.  Arkham Horror provides a better investment for a game of this length.  I'm wondering is I would enjoy more if I could ever play one of the heroes, or if a WarhammerQuest-type game might serve me better.

RATING: 7
Doom given the fantasy treatment, and done right. 

Despite many saying how "easy" this game is, I felt very in control as Overlord, and the game goes down to the bitter end.

Any "imbalances" in difficulty can easily be tweaked.

Another game that has had a map generator created, leaving almost endless play possibilities.

Update:

Years later, and this drops down thanks to so many newer games building so well on this great foundation.

RATING: 7
After having played it a few more times I have revised my rating down a little.  Its still a good game but for me it just takes too darn long to play and unless the Overlord squashes the heroes like a bug in the very beginning, the heros get so powerful that by the end its hopeless for the Overlord - Or maybe I just suck at being the Overlord...

This is  a fun arsed game, i like co-op games like this but it does take a long time to play our last game went for six hours... my only ohter problem with the game is that when you reach the final room the big bad guy is right in the middle of the room and is within walking distance and you have to kill him the same turn you open the door or you will be killed, its always come down to that when we've played (and made it there, often we just die in some random place half way through) But other than that its great fun

I really liked this edition.  It was fun to play but it is very long.  The game is very complex and fiddly like most Kevin Wilson games.  The game has been replaced by Second Edition Descent.  If you can find this version cheap, I would pick it up but realize the game can run 4-5 hours.

RATING: 8
A great recent attempt at creating a dungeon delving board game. This game is very fun to play at first but annoying for hero players who can't keep items and power increases between Quests as the campaign rules are very poor. The expansion Road to Legend fixes this with superior campaign rules for more hardcore players and if you got any expansion get that one it makes this game 10 times better. Still good on its own though and worth a look at if you like the genre of dungeon delving and killing monsters

RATING: 5
There are too many things wrong with this game to give it a higher score.  Nice art and graphics, good minis, but the gameplay is a mess.  The most effetive tactic, always, is to run a character into the middle of each new area to grab the treasure chest before even fighting any of the monsters.  I also don't like how many of the characters have weak or even useless special traits, making the drawn card abilites far more important to the power of a charcter.

The game is also anti-climactic.  If the heroes are going to lose, they will nearly always do so in the first hour of the game.  Past that, they are near garunteed a win, yet the game takes another two hours to finish.  I have never had a game where the named boss monster at the end has survived long enough to even make an attack.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A dungeon crawl game. This is the classic GM vs Players.
The game itself is very balanced and fun, and the level advancing system is just great.
Each player gets to play a unique character of choice (and there are many of them, each with its own statistics), and the GM has a very wide array of monsters at his disposal.
The only flaw in the advancement system is that magic items at higher levels are basically the same as in lower levels, but you get to roll more dice. Not very good.
Very smooth.

As long as you have the time to dedicate to this game then it's a hit. Expansions live up to their name and give you a lot of new experiences; as usual with FFG titles they are worth picking up. With 2 heroes they can find themselves quickly overwhelmed at times. I'd suggest playing with 3 heroes at least.

11-11-10 update: As expansions come into play and time goes on I find that I'm becoming less a fan of the Overlord vs players style dungeon crawl games. I'm leaning more towards the players only style of Dungeon Crawlers PvP or otherwise.

12-12-12 Update - I'm pretty much done with this type of game I think. It's too annoying to be going about my turn and then the "keeper" or "overlord" or whatever yells "STOP!" then I have to face the consequences of simply moving a space, and now my turn is probably over to boot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played a few times.

Too unbalanced.  Playing as a hero was fiddly and over-complicated.  Playing as the DM was painful - either you hold back in the early game to prevent pissing off the other players with an early party wipe, or you let the players cruise on for long enough to become so powerful that its no longer fun for you to play.  That sort of thing is appropriate for more story-based roleplaying games, but doesn't really work for a tactical miniatures dungeon crawl.

Second edition, with its streamlined gameplay and objective-based scenarios, should solve these complaints.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
As a long time D&D, GURPS, V:the Masquerade and Dark Heresy roleplayer, I find this game lacking in every single aspect. It may look pretty, but it's way too clunky (rules-wise) for a board-game and way too soulless for a (wannabe) role-playing game. I can accept why other people adore it, but it just doesn't work for me.

RATING: 2
[Played 48 times]
The core rules (mostly taken from "Doom") are decent, but would have needed a better development and much more playtesting (e.g. costs of the cards, Golden Items, etc.).
The scenarios are not very engaging (unbalanced and lacking any sort of flavour).

Being used to the GW titles (HQ, AHQ and especially WHQ), it lacks more variety of enemies, a "campaign mode" and a "random dungeon generator" (you'll need to design your scenarios, investing time and hoping to make them well).
I also miss a "magic system" worthy of this name (magic is just a different kind of ranged attack; it's as if the only known spell is "Magic Missile"... and ANY character may cast it! Despite the name, they're fireweapons, not magic).
There is a lot of randomness, but also tactical choices.

It has a more "German" approach to the dungeon crawling genre than the GW titles (e.g. optimization, resource management, simple story arc, extremely abstract town, etc.).
It also lacks much of the "dungeon crawling" feeling: you're a commando trying to rush in, grab the goodies and kill the enemies before they can react and crush you; it doesn't feel like exploring, discovering, alternating battles and lulls, etc.

Long.
It'd need too much work even to house rule it into a decent game.
Disappointing.

Un juego que recopila todo lo que Los laberintos y calabozos pueden ser. Con una gran cantidad de monstruos y tesoros. Complejo y divertido, un juego puede durar 3 horas..o 15 minutos, dependiendo que tan buena suerte tiene el Monstruo Máster en sacar sus cartas y súbditos. A medida que se avanza en el juego, los caracteres suben en experiencia y fuerza...al igual que los Monstruos  y los combates avanzan en complejidad.

I played Doom 1st Edtition, then I played Descent 1st Edition, then I thought Descent 2nd edition is better, because it is more streamlined, then Star Wars: Imperial Assault came out and I was hyped like everyone else, but now after so many years, I think this version is oddly still the best. It is not well balanced, which is its major drawback, but then again, none of the other versions is really well balanced either. So since the other version do not really improve upon Descent's weak points and even leave behind many of it's strong points, Descent 1st Edition has a certain charm and really cool mechanics, none of the other versions offer. 

For instance:
- In this version melee Heroes actually have stronger melee attacks with any melee weapon, because they add a certain number of dice to their melee attacks. The same applies to magic or ranged attacks. In the 2nd Edition any Hero can use any weapon with the same efficiency.
- In this version there are magic attacks. In the 2nd edition they left that element.

Played once at a get-together of my former AD&D group, whose members are now scattered all over Europe. For that crowd it's a good game, reminiscent of AD&D but a lot less preparation time and not reliant of all the same people being there.
But being mostly a Euro-gamer these days, I found it lacking in meaningful decisions and too slow. And the theme and storyline were too generic and predictable to save it.

Initially bought it to use the figures for the second edition. The only real downside to this game is the length. Otherwise it really does an amazing job at giving you the feel of leveling up your character in a single "game" or quest.

Descent: Journeys in the Dark is a semi-cooperative game in which two to five players will take on the antagonistic roles of heroes and Overlord. Up to four players will choose characters with a wide assortment of skills and innate abilities to be the heroes who will explore dungeons in search of treasure and adventure. One player will take on the role of the Overlord and will control the dungeon's many traps, puzzles, and monsters.
The heroes' goal will be to cooperatively conquer the dungeon, seize its many treasures, and achieve other objectives as set by the scenario. If the heroes cooperate and achieve their goals, they will all win. The Overlord's objective is simply to use all the means at his or her disposal - from deadly traps and ferocious monsters - to kill the heroes. Each hero has a certain Conquest Point value to the party and if too many Conquest Points are lost through hero death, the party loses and the Overlord wins.

     A great dungeon crawler with loads of monsters, interesting characters, hoards of treasure, solid rules, customizable playfield and high production.  My only real turn off was that characters essentially are reset after each dungeon, limiting development.  For me that was a deal breaker though you can fix this by creating your own rules.  If you can look past or overcome this, I can't think of a better heroquest - type game.

It's DOOM, only with more options and a fantasy theme - I would have been very surprised if I had not enjoyed this tremendously, and I wasn't. Surprised, that is. Might go to a ten with more plays.
For tackling the later (and harder) quests with only two heroes, I definitely recommend drawing only one overlord card per turn.
Played 25+ times.

I really enjoy Descent and think FFG has done a brilliant job. It reminds me of the old Heroquest and Advanced Heroquest games.

Its well worth every penny.

RATING: 8
Without expansions you can only play skirmishes, which are standalone episodes without hero or overlord progression. Very enjoyable but that prevent you from getting any attachment to your character.

Nevertheless, if complemented with Road to Legend or Sea of Blood, the campaign mode is absolute superb! You will be playing long sessions (no less than three hours) for several days.

Just as long as Doom, but better for the heroes.  It's better for 3 out of 4 people to enjoy a game than 1 out of 4 in my opinion.  A definite improvement.  The different scenarios change the difficulty for each side dramatically.  It would probably be in my top 10 if it was consistently in the 3-4 hour range, but at 5-7 hours, it gets docked a bit.

RATING: 9
A superb dungeon crawler game filled with theme. It borrows heavily the elements from the D&D and MMORPGs (such as monster spawns and reviving at town after death). The game has a lot of goodness such as the ability to customize your character's equipments, dungeon exploration, an overlord that makes each game a unique experience for the heroes, and challenging gameplay that results in high replay values. It also sports tons of user-made game scenarios that you can download for free. You can even create your own scenarios. On the downside, you need an overlord to control the monsters, the game does not have a 'healer' (which is crucial in an RPG setting), there isn't much of a story for each scenario, and each game can run between 2 - 6 hours. Despite the shortcomings, Descent is the best dungeon crawler board game out on the market today. Highly recommended.

RATING: 7
I've played this a couple of times. It seemed fun, if not unbelievably slow. Not really a table-top rpg/combat game, as much as a game about line of sight.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good for about 4-5 hours of fun, if you have that amount of time to spare in the first place. More fun for the heroes than the Overlord, but hopefully you have an experienced group of players who can rotate Overlord duty with you. Quests are frequently imbalanced, some seem to be impossible unless you've played before and know where everything is, others are way too forgiving. 

House rules are your friend for this game.

RATING: 4
First coffin-box game I acquired; loved the idea, but in practice couldn't get anyone to play with me. After finally getting a couple of sessions in, I understood why - it wants to be more fun than it can possibly be given that ruleset. Some great ideas here (and obviously a wildly successful game), but it didn't click for me.

I also didn't have the Road to Legend, and I vastly prefer campaign modes (see also: Ambush!).

Thank God I didn't sell it, and so had a bunch of minis available when...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Won my first run-through on this, though I think Ted (the dungeonmaster) may have placed the wrong sorts of treasures in the first area--the setup keys aren't sufficiently distinct between bronze and gold treasures, and it's too easy to confuse the two.  So, I may have had an unanticipated advantage.  Looking forward to playing again.

RATING: 7.5
A very long, engaging game, that I really enjoy when I play with the right people.  The material is top notch and the box is full.  This is the first modern board game I bought in 2007.  I started painting all the figurines and really got into this game with my friends and we played more than 20 adventures in 2 years.  Since they moved after university, the game has collected dust a little (I am still painting the expansions, so it see the light of day once in a while).  For me, it is hard to find people who would dedicate a couple of full evening to play such a long game..  It is also noted that expansions bring the rating up for me as it add so much more stuff and options to an already jam packed game, and address some balance issues.  Speaking of balance, I believe that when the game is played the way it was intended (as a strategic positioning game, not a role playing game) it is rather well balanced (with minor houserules).  I could have won half the games I played as an overlord, but most of the time, because time was running out, I had to cut some slack on the heroes...

If you want to enjoy this game with a little more casual gamers, make sure to visite the FFG website and try some fan created missions.  Some are 2h long and very creative and fun.  I rate the base game a 7.5, but consider the expansions for more options and stuff and an advanced campain, and it's worth a 9 and my favorite game of all time.  Painted miniatures (100% complete)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The dungeon crawler I've been looking for. One where the dungeon master is there to win, That makes it challenging for both the players and the master. Plus there is a lot of "replayability" given the numerous characters in the base game. That's not event considering expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Excellent components and rules (in the main) seem to indicate this will be a good game - however, I must be doing something wrong as the game soon becomes a slog as the dungeonmaster justs keeps generating monster after monster after monster. The initial scenario which I would have thought would have been easyish to break the players in is virtually impossible the way I play it! The others just get worse...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After 5 plays I would say this is the new boardgaming dungeon crawl.  All else is obsolete.  We haven't scratched the service and it is excellent.  Yes, it has scaling issues and that keeps the game not as highly rated as it will go when we add in the expansions (esp RtL).

After completing a RtL campaign, the 8 rating stands.  Lots of good stuff, but _lots_ of rolling and re-calculating bogs down the combat and the game.  It is a classic anyhow.

I may move this down a notch as it hasn't seen play much in the last year or so.

Played only the first scenario with a buddy, and man did it take forever. Not a BAD game, but I'll have to give it a few more whirls to see if it's better than the 7.5 I've given it so far!

"Doom Lite" is the best way to describe it. Same great look as DOOM, but none of the insanity and fear. I thought it was a little TOO easy when compared with DOOM (at least the first adventure at any rate) I'd still play it whenever someone is willing to run it, but I would choose DOOM over this any day.

It is a fun game, just not what I am looking for. The items are highly unbalancing; if the players get to a gold treasure chest they win, if not the overlord wins.

Plenty of errors and balance issues but that goes without saying in an FFG game.
The game is fairly fun for the first hour or two but there it starts to drag. I feel its too long for something that is largely brainless and random.

It's no D&D, thats for sure, but there in one finds what's great about the game; when you just want to mindlessly bash some monsters and wantonly hurl yourself into danger and adventure, this really fits the bill without having many rules to deal with or mental energy drains. Run in, smash stuff till one of you dies, repeat.

It's not Warhammer Quest and there is something I really dislike about the portal mechanic - but still generally a fun dungeon-crawl game. Like most FFG games with multiple expansions - it gets very parts-heavy quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This dungeoncrawler managed to surprise me. It's much more than the simple 'move & roll dice' type of games in this genre. It's also much more fun to play for the 'DM' player than most of its ilk.

Still, I prefer playing one of the heroes, because the downtime can be immense for the Overlord. Couple this with the long playing time and I cannot say that this is the best dungeoncrawler ever, but it's pretty good. It looks great too.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Great dungeon delve in the spirit of D&D and Hero Quest, but better balanced and more fun for all participants. Even more fun if The Road to Legend is added (but playing time and the competitive balance become issues).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
What a waste of a great system.  Descent, on the surface, seems to have everything one could want in a dungeon crawl.  Unfortunately, almost every scenario published for the game is completely busted, with the game quickly degenerating into one bout of toe-to-toe dice pitching after another.  This is tolerable to a point, but in a 3+ hour game, it's tedious in the extreme.  I'm convinced there's a good game hidden in here somewhere, though.  Perhaps this one is in need of a "Designer Series" book of its own. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The setup on this game is killer. We played a campaign of Sea of Blood for a few sessions and it was fun but it take too long to setup and tear-down for the 2-2.5 hour sessions we usually have during the week. This would be a great gaming session marathon game but I can't justify bringing this out on weeknight game nights. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a really fun game.  As the OL, I enjoyed throwing up challenges against the players (while secretly rooting for them, actually: my friend and his 10-year old son).  As the heroes, I enjoyed the traps, surprises and pitfalls while working as part of a team to win.  The only reason it doesn't rate higher is because it's a very long game.  Shame, because it's really LOTS of fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Too long, and too complex, but that's the point of this game, so I don't punish it for that. Too much, anyway.

The one thing this game has going for it is that it embraces the cliches of dungeon crawlers. That means it scratches an itch - for long, drawn out battles in a dark, scary dungeon. There are definite moments of "How the heck will we win?" scattered amongst brutal fights and epic victories. The Overlord doesn't stand a chance in the base game, but that might be ok.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Current favorite in the house with the 8 and 6 year old boys.  They are able to play but do not use 100% of the rules (i.e. not alot of aims, dodges, etc) and the tactics are simple.

Update Aug 2008:  Still the current favorite and the boys tactics and play has improved greatly.  As overlord, I play the game more as a boardgame version of a RPG and try to ensure the boys have fun over crushing them under my Overlordish might!

Interesting fun game.  Plays well with 2-5 players although it seems the overlord wins to often. If you go with this be prepared to spend some money on organizers as they will tremendously speed up set up and play. If you like simple dugeon crawls with lots of tactical style combat this is your game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Good.
1. D&D adventure in 3 hours (or less).
2. Beautiful components.
3. Custom scenarios. Team match is fun (played a 2V2).

Bad
1. Overlord is boring. To make the game a FUN session for everyone, you don't want to kill the heroes early in the game where you're relatively more powerful. However, once the heroes get their silver chest, the game basically goes haywire. When they get the gold chest, there is really nothing the Overlord can do. You see inevitability, but it drags on and on.
2. Pen & Paper D&D using Miniature rules is more fun, more flexible, more free-form, and allows for more creativity. I know they are different things, just cannot help but to compare~^^
3. Fiddly? There are way too many counters. Poison, stun, web, aim, health, fatigue, etc, etc. At that level of detail you wonder why aren't you playing actual D&D.

Update: Dropped 7 Â» 6.5. "Play sporadically" due to set up and game length.

Update: Sold

Update: After playing Descent 2.0, this version officially gets a 1.

RATING: 6
Without a doubt the best RPG style board game I've played. Although I feel the same way about this game as I do every other game in this genre; If your gonna invest five hours playing, why play something like this, when there is always clearly the better game, D&D. It had some cool parts to it, adding little things to it that makes you really get into the action, although the game was definitely a hack n slash, it also had some really annoying things that the GM could do to you. As with every other RPG style game I've played, there is just a painful amount of downtime, while rules are argued over and argued over again, almost feeling like there was 20-30 minutes between my turn. Pretty fun, however very fiddly, you have to have your wits about you to answer some of the rules questions this game produced.

Played it once at Richard and Kelly's apartment.  The campaign expansions were a little much for me but the base game reminds me of the evolution of games like HeroQuest and Dragon Strike from my Youth.  Seems like a good dungeon crawler to spend a rainy night playing.

RATING: 8
Beautiful, although bendy, components.  The game is best with 3-4 players.  While the game is balanced overall, one side will always be getting hammered at any point in the game; many quests will go from very hard to very easy on the players as they gain power quickly.  Also, I don't like the fact that the harder the overlord plays, the longer the game gets.  It seems like the game really stretches (4+ hours) if the overlord brings it and even more if the players aren't willing to push on (e.g. trying to get every treasure, etc).  

Update: While I still like this game, I'm hoping that Road to Legend will shorten the game.  If I don't play frequently enough then games end up taking 8 hours.

New to this game, but it reminds me of HeroQuest, which I spent many hours playing with my friends when I was younger. It's a lot smarter and more in depth, but there's the thrill of discovery and the wonderful notion that there's a group working against an intelligent force in stead of just the rules, chance, board or each other.

Great game, lots of fantasy appeal. Steep learning curve and can be a little unforgiving to the players. Runs the risk of turning away some players after a few failed attempts at the same scenerio.

Introduced after the third straight day/night of gaming.  The game has brilliant components.  It was very beneficial for our characters to get wasted, go to town and re-appear.

I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard due to the lack of sleep and in game comments we made.

Another one I was pleasantly surprised.  I thought that a dungeon would take an eternity to finish but our group did the first mission in around 3 hours top which is very....decent... :-)

The game was enjoyable, the dice throwing was a great variation on our usually very cerebral game night.  I wouldn't play Descent each week, but it's good to play a game where the spirit is as much fun as the goal.

I can see where the game can be a big downer though.  If you have a player or two that takes forever to make a decision, it could become an horrendous experience.  I'm very lucky with my game mates...no worry on this side.

Edit march 2010 : That game grows on me....8 to 8.5

If you like D&D or at least the dungeon fighting you will like this game.  The down fall is that the set up takes a lot of time.  We will be going through the road to legend with the campaign aspect and hopefully that will decrease the set up time.  If you do not mind a long set up I highly recommend it but with the expansions so the Overlord has a shot to kick the hero's butts.

20 years ago I'd have loved this game as thematically it's got all the elements required.

However, World of Warcraft has killed games like this. I'd simply much rather play Warcraft with a good raiding guild than go through another game of Descent.

What kills Descent for me is that there is no "threat meter" like Warcraft, the GM just makes the monsters go for the squishies.

BTW, I gave up playing World of Warcraft once the "Lich King" expansion came out, it was just simply too easy. The original WoW & the Burning Crusade expansion was brilliant, but Blizzard broke WoW.

And FFG broke Descent.

One of my favorite Dungeon Crawls.  Highly entertaining but terribly time consuming and somewhat fiddly with all the setup as new monsters and items are introduced.

While I used to LOVE this game, I now hate it.  It, to me, is completely broken.  I've played with 1 group over and over again and they cannot beat me if I'm the Overlord.  I have also played several times with other groups and they too get totally smashed. The game is so completely imbalanced that it is no fun/unplayable.

Excellent parts and art direction.  Tons of bits and cool-looking pieces.  Good for young teenage boys to hack and slash through waves and waves of baddies.  Lots of variations and things to try out, but I'm just not seeing a huge fun factor.  Maybe because it's all rather ponderous and plodding on the whole.  Plus, it seems to take forever to make much progress.

After more plays, this is a clunky, slow, and tedious event.

RATING: 7.5
Revised rating after some years of playing. As time becomes less sparse, things like playing time, setup time, rules weight and balance become more important, since you really want things to be worth your while when you need to devote considerable effort to a game. Well, Descent falls short in these categories. It's still a fine game, no doubt, but one wonders whether a similar experience couldn't be achieved with somewhat more elegant rules.

(2nd ed. doesn't count, as it does purposely not deliver that same experience.)

RATING: 3.75
Played better than I expected, but primarily because of the fun group of people we got together.  Overall, the effect was too slow in developing: I'd rather play a roleplaying game.  I did not like the fact killed characters just return to the board, or that can run so easily back and forth to town... seemed like cheating.  Great to play once, but that is all I think I need.  Overly lavish for what the game is: for $70, I'd expect more replay value and more creatures and adventures, but I see they are already coming out with $30 expansions: for $70, I can have a complete set of roleplaying books, and an infinite number of adventures.  But if I were 12 and had never roleplayed, this would be a dream come true.  One of the better dungeon crawlers, though, but outclassed by Magic Realm.

The cons are pretty much identical with Doom:

-downtime if Overlord isn't politely hurrying players... 
-when played as a continuing campaign: not much of the gained stuff transfer from the previous missions?
-dice symbols are quite small

Engaging, tactically interesting and fun dungeon crawl.  The permutations of characters, abilities, treasures, scenarios and monsters are distinct feeling and rich in theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros
-I really like the diversity of characters and the way they get customized. 
- Openining treasure chests is a lot more fun than it should be :)
- Cool minis
- Some interesting tactical decisions to be made; I like the semi-cooperation aspect of the game
- This is Doom, moving in the right direction
Cons
- I preferred the Doom theme
- Seems like they overcorrected Doom; Descent felt too easy and lacked any real tension. 
- Those gold treasures are just way too overpowered

Verdict: I'm looking forwward to trying other dungeons and seeing if they get any harder. I like the overall feel of the game and the corrections they made to the spawning process and DM win mechanics, but it feels like this was an overreaction to Doom's impossible scenarios. If the other dungeons are harder than the one I've tried, I'll be happy.

Although I prefer this kind of visual representation of dungeon crawling over tabletop D&D (I come from the computer RPG generation), this genre of boardgaming just doesn't cut it for me.  Doesn't help that the first scenario we tried was CRAZY unbalanced... spent more time thinking of ways to balance it than actually play it.

RATING: 10
Perhaps one of the most visually-pleasing fantasy adventure miniatures games published in recent years, I first saw this game at its release in Essen; and had to have it! The minis alone are worth the price of admission, but it's appeal rates right-up there with my first experiences with the likes of Heroquest and Talisman. Superb game - though not for the faint of heart with playing-times rating in the minimum 3 hour category.

Very fun, but way too long and the swing fights are a little lame.  It's either too easy for the heroes (due to lucky loot) or too easy for the OL.  Fights lack tension because it's usually a wipe/kill for one side back and forth.

RATING: 7
i still have no idea what to think.  fairly gamey at times which does not feel right for a dungeon crawl.  need to play a long scenario if playing on a one-off basis to get to the sweet spot of the system.  probably best played under the Road to Legend format which requires a decent commitment.

i'd like to plow through a real campaign, even if i am required to do it solo.

I want to like this game but every time I play it the Heroes completely obliterate the Overlord.  I'm talking not even close here.  I like to think we're doing something wrong but I have no idea what.  It would hit the table a lot more often if it weren't for this fact.

I don't really like dungeon crawlers, but this one is by far, the worst. Some scenarios take forever to play, the whole deal of using portals to go to a village and buy equipment is ridiculous, and it's just not worth the time and effort of buying and playing the game.

Note: Although I have only recorded one play, I have unfortunately tried this game four times before coming to this conclusion, so yes, I know what I'm talking about.

Descent is a nice game, but its mechanics worked far better in Doom thematic-wise. It just doesn't feel right running around not killing monsters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Descent: Jourineys in the Dark is a top quality game with a plethora of components! The atmosphere of the game is very good, and the rules are of just about the right complexity to allow for many possibilities and replayability, while still allowing a good game flow. I don't like the fact that games last veeery long - I never got it shorter than six hours with various groups! Fact is, we always had at least one new player who didn't know the rules, so it might go down to five with experienced players. The final hour of play can get a bit tiresome as everybody gets low on concentration.
My conclusion is: you can have loads of fun with Descent if you expect to have a group of at least three people who are willing to play for such a long time. And if you also like to paint minis, Descent can keep you supplied for months with decent plastic pieces! :D
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Although I love this kind of Games, I can't rate Descent higher than 6, simply because the game is very unbalanced.

At the Beginnig, a small group of Players may have a hard time, but when the first treasures have been found, the game gets way too easy fast.

Also, it somehow misses the right atmosphere - it just doesn't feel like the careful exploration of an unknown dungeon full of dangers, but more like some kind of special forces covert operation.

Quality adventure / dungeon crawl game. It can take some time but it's mostly well spent. Dice, fights, laughs, moans, the ups the downs, it's all here - the way it oughta be. Made redundant by the 2nd edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Okay dungeon crawl game with beautiful presentation.  I'd rate it higher but for the 'length vs. depth'.  The length is killing the fun.  After all it's just a hack n slash dice fest with an unfortunate video game feel.  That being said, the combat system is fair as is the way player turns and hero orders are resolved.  Having played magic realm and being a long time rpg player I did not find the game to be very deep or difficult to manage.  Much easier to play than even Arkham Horror for example.  I expect this game would be a big hit with younger players looking for that rpg-lite experience who don't know that playing real RPG's is much better.  Good for five players.  It could be that the expansions make this more fun.  I haven't tried them yet.  Frankly, for young people I would much rather just use Heroquest or a game that is an all around better dungeon crawl (which is most of them).  I doubt I'll ever play it as I'd much rather just play AD&D 2e or another RPG.

Come back HeroQuest and Advanced HeroQuest. Poorly written rules and system need to be streamlined. Far too many things to remember and they don't necessarily connect in an intuitive manner.

It always feels like something big is actually at stake as we near the end of the adventure. The OL player needs to be a ruthless bastard, and the Hero players need to understand that the OL is NOT a DM and NOT their friend, but a legitimate opponent whose plans and attempts need to be thwarted. Once that locks into place, this game is an immersive blast.

Note: playing WITHOUT the expansions seems to be my preferred way. The expansions just add too much advantage for the OL.

Great game. If I was only a teenager again, then maybe I would have time for this. Or maybe a basement we could have left it set up in. Everybody liked it, but nobody liked the time it took to play. 1 game night a month and this is the only game you get to play and don't even finish...didn't work for us. 
Also, I would have been fine with the 1 person is the villain thing as a kid, but as an adult...it just wasn't much fun. All just personally preferences, the game itself is awesome for those who have that kind of time, space and don't mind going back to the days of being a dungeonmaster again. :)

descent is FUN. it's almost more of a strategy game taking place in a dungeon rather than a dungeon crawl, but i don't want to get into any sort of argument about what those categories mean (and subsequently how i have miscategorized this game).

RATING: 8
A classic dungeon crawl adventure, Descent is beautiful to look at and great to play. The gameplay offers a meaty fantasy adventure game that is thick with theme. 

It's only real downfalls are that games tend to bog down with more players as analysis paralysis takes hold- hero players can argue over who's moving where and in what order for more then 20 minutes per turn!

It's also unweildly and very fiddley with you constantly having to reveal and add the many, many game components. Can take much longer then even Arkham Horror to play a single game!

The Overlord player is also a little over-powered when it comes to the stand alone missions and can often crush the Heroes in a couple of turns if he puts his will to it! 

These things hold it from being a 9 or 10 for me, but it's still a damn good experience though.

Trouble with regular game group attendance and negative opinions about time/fiddlyness of this one are making it difficult to hit the gaming area. Prepping not one but TWO variants with hope of being able to play it again! Sad but true.

Progressive Rating: 10-9-8-9-8-7-8.

Long! This can take 7 hours or more for what appears to be a fairly straight forward map. The room tiles and some of the cards could perhaps be a little more attractive. Combat machanics are good though, and it benefits from a good mix of RPG and boardgame elements. A little let down by some fairly bland art at times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good dungeon crawler game. Despite being dice-based, the combat system works very well. Plays in 4 or 5 hours which is more than the average german boardgames, but is a lot less than most of the RPG sessions. Great game for those who like the tactical combat aspect of RPGs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Long game but lots of fun. I think the optimal number of players is 4 (ie 3 herois, one overlord). The minis are some of the best I've ever seen and you get a ton of stuff to play with. Descent is a good subsitute for RPG systems, which usually have tedious rule systems with narratives that are easily undone by the players despite hours of planning by the GM.

RATING: 6
Lots of cool bits, and a good dungeon crawl. For some reason, we've never had as much fun with it as we did with Doom: the Boardgame.

(revised after several plays) - As a competitive game - not as good as Doom. After a few more plays, I don't think it's ever been much fun for anyone playing it. I like dungeon crawls as much as the next geek, but there's something about this game that always leaves everyone feeling like there should be more game to it.

It does have great components, no one has really suggested otherwise, but I really wish they were to a different game.

Edit - I have Well of Darkness now, so add the two together and the game becomes an 8 rather than a 6. It's not just more of the same - more treasure cards, overlord cards, monsters, etc.

The expansion makes some simple additions to the system  that do a lot for the fun factor of playing the overlord. Customizing the OL deck is a huge improvement. The bleed and daze status flesh out the system a lot, as does the addition of tactically different monsters like kobolds and ferrox. I'm sold on their ability to improve the game with future expansions, and when the campaign expansion comes out I think I'll have bought Altar of Despair because Well was so effective at improving the base game.

RATING: 9
The closest thing to a dungeon crawl outside the PC. Hell, i'd say it's better then most pc-rpgs anyway.  With AMAZING production values it has perhaps the best collateral material of any game - bar none.

Until rule familiarity sets in expect rather long play times. Accept this, and you'll be treated to an excellent dungeon crawl... and a well deserved '9'

I already liked Doom, and I think this is a logical improvement on that engine, wrapped in a fun fantasy, dungeon crawling RPG style dressing...

Dying three quarters into a scenario however is really not fun, neither for the overlord nor for the players. Basically it's a win for the Overlord (yay!), but it also means you don't get to play the climax encounter (booh!). And because it probably will have taken a few hours to get to that point, it's usually too much for all involved to restart the scenario. Resulting in a somewhat less that satisfactory game session for all...

My biggest caveat is that the setup and tear-down time is really, really long. For us this became an issue. In fact so much so, that we abandoned Descent in favor for actual RPG sessions.

We love Descent. Love, love, love it. I've now bought all the expansions, and am even building new Descent tile pieces out of plaster, using the Hirst Arts molds. But it's so much work and time to set up, that we are playing Ravenloft more often.

I've been gaming for over 25 years and I find that while I started with Squad Leader, now I'm a huge fan of beer and pretzels games.  This is such a game.  There is a time commitment to playing it, and it is great fun to play.  I heartily recommend it to anyone looking for a dungeon-crawl game.

RATING: N/A
Taking the combat system of DOOM, this dungeon crawl game has the familiar dungeon master taking on the role of the evil player, and the other players attempting to complete quests, typically destroying all the monsters in a dungeon. The combat system has been updated to be more favorable towards the players. There are 20 characters to choose from, different abiity cards dealt out at the beginning of the game, and players can spend money to acquire goods. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My first and only RPG type thing.

Surprisingly I really, really enjoyed it. I MUST be the Overlord however, and I WILL be nasty!

Balance is a bit off for 2-players, making it pretty tough for the heros, but just about do-able. ideally there needs to be three heros.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
Single best dungeon-crawl game. This game gets dungeon crawls down to how they should be. Any flaws with the game are only limitations of the genre itself. The game is well crafted in all regards. I've played them and I consider this game better than:
-HeroQuest (all versions)
-DragonStrike
-Dungeons and Dragons

This game should be seen as a superior alternative to any of these games.

Like BSG, Descent, etc. This game doesn't provide a natural incentive to move swiftly and yet, I've discovered that it's MUCH MUCH more fun when it's played quickly since it is an action--real time game simulation after all. I strongly recommend a system using timers where every player has a 1-3 minute timer which doesn't limit their entire turn but how long to take major decisions (they can still execute decisions after timer) this really speeds things up and makes things feel fun, exciting, and tense rather than just stressful, daunting, or overly drawn out. You can impose different reward/punishment incentives with health and ammo in subtle ways from the beginning so that there's incentive to move quickly but your not horribly punished if you occasionally go over.

This game, Battlestar Galactica, and Descent would all get .5 to 1 score higher with me if you use clever streamlined mechanics so that a timer for each turn is actually part of the game and at least one person knows the rules so well that he doesn't have to check rulebook ever and other people know the rules at least fairly well on top of that.

I like it, but games are a bit long, and a bit strange. It's more all-or-nothing in play that I was expecting, or perhaps hoping. Overall, I do like it, but do think that I like the idea more than the actual play.

The expansions do help round it out a lot. After those, I don't really want to play the base game again. And with the second edition, it's hard to see going back.

I really liked this game.  A great Fantasy-Adventure game with mini's that are none other than first rate.  The rule booklet is written in typical Fantasy Flight Games style, which means that it is poorly written, but it still is a fun game.  4 adventurers seems to have things easier than 3 adventurers, which I believe to be the magic number (4) when playing this game.  Highly recommended.  It is a lengthly game though, so do plan several hours for it, especially your first time through.

I simply do not understand how others state that the game is too easy.  The Overlord regularly kicks the snot out of players, and now my gaming groups realize that no fewer than 5 people are required to play this game.  I usually play the GM as I know the rules the best, and no scenario (and I mean none) are easy for them.  I won the first scenario the first 3 times we played it.  People were getting a bit dismayed when the game was being lost by the party so often.  Now, it's about a 50-50 chance of a very experienced party making through a scenario.

I'm not a fan of the "dungeon crawl" genre - I'd rather play a real role-playing game and have a vested interest in the character - so take this into consideration when looking at my rating. As these games go, I did enjoy the 4+ hours of play enough that I would play again. Awesome production, too! I'm really looking forward to the Road To Legend add-on, as it will let my character grow... one of my major complaints about these kinds of games.

RATING: 7.5
I'm not sure why I'm not giving this a score higher than Doom's 8. It may be that we played a 3-player and it was the first time so a lot of rules reading and whatnot was necessary... I imagine a second game with a few more people would quickly bump this to 8, 8.5 or even a...gasp, 9. 

OK - repeat games later - changed rating to reflect cool dungeoning experiences 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The reports that this is Doom, but better, are accurate.  This takes care of many of the problems that kept Doom from shining.  A fun dungeon-crawl and plenty of interesting tactical decisions to make from turn to turn.  I suspect it might be more fun (for me anyway) to play as a Hero rather than as the Overlord as you can grow rather attached to your Hero - much moreso than one did to the Marines in Doom.

---update
After playing the first three quests as the Overlord this game is a bonafide hit.  More interesting decisions to make on both sides and the story telling aspect is much stronger.  Takes a fair amount of time to play, and that goes up with more players, but still recommended.

---update
Upgraded again based on the strength of 2player games.  One OL and one player controlling 3 heroes is a tense romp and relatively quick (3 hrs for a full game - very reasonable).  Have never had a bad game of this.


---update---
Upgraded AGAIN!  This.  Game.  RAWKS!!!

We do not play frequently so a classic role playing game is not the right thing for us. But some of its flavor we can preserve by playing Descent. All the game pieces are of high quality, the game mechanics work very well, and most of the time it is well balanced between the Overlord and the heroes.

The different kinds of quests and expansions render the game even more interesting and funny to play! This is definitely one of my very best games!

Very fun game.  Anyone who likes fantasy games or RPGs will probably like this (at least among my friends who do).  I'd describe it as Hero Quest but more fun and more evolved.  My only complaints, and they are small ones, are that the board pieces don't fit together quite as nicely as they should, and while the box says the games take 2-4 hours, we haven't played a full game yet that took less than 5.  But then again we're always drinking and distracted.  Anyhow, I love this game.  It's spiffy!

Easily my favorite board game.  I fell in love with Heroquest and the dungeon-crawler genre as a kid, I thought of them as lite(er)-RPGs.  I am still striving to find a regular group that will play this with me twice a month so I can unveil Road to Legend.

In the game one player takes the role of Overlord who controls all the monsters and traps the rest of the players will face when they take their role of heroes.

RATING: 8.5
Descent just happens to hit everything I like in a game. Amazing atmosphere, great figures. Why not give it a 10? No pre-painted figures (I know, so needy) and if you play the game straight, without house rules or modifications, the game can be impossibly difficult and frustrating for the hero, as the overlord can virtually spawn new enemies each round, bogging the game down indefinitely.

The best part about the game is that the rules basically create a miniatures/battle system that can then be dropped into a more complex or expansive role-playing type game. It's possible to play any which way you like. For most, it's a straight competitive death match between players. For me, it's more about story and role-playing, switching to the regular battle mode when it's time to confront monsters.

RATING: 8
A fun distillation of the dungeon crawling experience. Some fiddling rules, but it uses the "Doom dice" to tremendous effect. The addition of surges on the dice enrich the experience considerably, and the game is arguably more balanced than Doom. I enjoyed my game tremendously, but it was very long, too long for the mechanics to adequately support it. I'm hoping that future games will be shorter and thus improve my rating - as it stands only Twilight Imperium is longer of the game I've played.

A hell of a lot of fun with the right group. Problem seems to be that it is nearly impossible for the players to beat the overlord once he knows how to work the system. Would receive a perfect 10 due to the great shared experience if an experienced Overlord didn't win nearly every game. 

Update: Score increased due to Road to Legend, which fixes (nearly) every aspect of the game and turns it into the game I've wanted it to be. Still not a perfect 10 all around but it's nearly there.

Average dungeon romp. More "gamey" than old classics such as Advanced Heroquest, which means it delivers more meaningful decisions and tension, but removes a lot of the fun and by the third hour it becomes a slog. The roleplaying element and character development is non-existent in the base game.

RATING: 7
[rating based on just the basic set, the Road to Legend expansion makes the game an ongoing campaign which I prefer]

I have played six sessions.   A good game overall, but it has several problems which keep it off my table.

Does not scale well as you change the number of players; game is much more difficult with 2 heroes and is much easier with 4.  [campaign version fixes this]

A single game can take several hours and I don't usually have that much time to play games. [the sessions are much shorter in the campaign version]

You lose all items, treasure and upgrades at the end of each dungeon so there really isn't any character growth. [the campaign fixes this]

RATING: 8
When I'm in the mood for dungeoncrawl, I'll rather choose Doom instead. 

Why? Although I like its basic design, I think the game has some flaws as well as some aspects I just find disappointing: I don't like the Overlord going after the weakest player(s) all the time. I don't like that magic abilities are useful for combat exclusively, and not for detection of traps, hidden doors, creating darkness, speeding up players etcetc... as we know it from real RPGs. 
Finally, I have to admit that the cheesy cartoonish artwork is an issue for me. I really really don't like it. Sounds stupid, but it's true.

UPDATE May 2013
Just finished an 8h session with Tomb of Ice, and loved it a lot. I wasn't bored for even one minute. Liked it better than Doom (more variability, the scenario felt more balanced). It also looks better, the colours FFG used for the minis don't look as ugly as those of Doom, and it seems to me they hired a better artist for the drawings for the expansion?

 A good dungeon crawler, though its specificities sometimes alienate it from the genre. The definite change of the Overlord from a DM-like entity to an all-out opposing player was an excellent idea, which makes it more of a game than a watered down rpg. Its Doom the boardgame roots can be felt here. The rules are a bit of a mess, though, and lack fluidity and elegance. One major downside : there is no real feeling of exploration, no thrill of discovering what's hidden behind the door, since the entire dungeon is layed out at the beginning. Seems this got even worse with the second edition, were each "encounter" looks more like a tactical scenario.

Too complicated & with a completely broken game mechanic (being and old AD&D player like myself) ... you are expected to die, it is part of the game mechanic, go ahead and die 8 times repeatedly just to defeat the dungeon you are in and the monsters you are fighting. 

You will resurrect instantly in town and can run back and keep fighting over and over and.. I might as well be playing a computer game instead. 

The end justifies the means style of design, I.. Do... Not.. Like!

The game that got me into board gaming still has a ton of appeal to me. While somewhat fiddly in comparison to more modern games it still creates a great sense of challenge and dread as characters charge head long into the abyss of countless hordes of monsters and brutal traps. Great piles of minis, powerful weapons and edge of your seat dice throwing are all such great staples of the genre, and anything else I ever play ends up measured against this coffin boxed beast of game which tells me it did a lot of things right.

A really simple (once you get past the rulebook) dungeon crawler, yet still a decently complex tactical fighting game.  Enough 'build/improvement' during each singular game to be fun every time.  I could use a bit more RPG character development, which is why, someday, I may get that expansion.

After one play, this seems to be a great dungeon crawl with just enough complexity to make it worth repeated plays. You can't just hack and slash - you have to think on your feet and having one player play as Overlord against the heroes means that you aren't restricted to an "AI" like with other games (Castle Ravenloft, etc).  I really like this game and with the Road to Legend expansion am looking forward to seeing how campaigns add to it.

Good dungeon crawl. Needs least 3 adventurers. Gameplay varies from 15 minutes to 5 hours (same scenario, different characters). Replayability is very high and sessions tend to differ from each other.

Do not love this game. It is, imo, the worst of the "one guy runs the show" co-op games. Playing as the Overlord is fun, paticularly once you've added in a bunch of the expansions. This is truly a 2-player game, with the first player being optionally decentralized across many chairs.

Great looking bits and color, though, and I've grown to be a big Terrinoth fan. I think this would be a gorgeous game to bring fully painted, with 3D map pieces, to a convention for the attaboys. However, it has no place at our table. Gave it away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The co-operative element for the adventurers - talking through the tactical options, turn order and then executing - really helps make the theme come alive and that's a big plus over other dungeon crawlers where you're playing solo. On the down side, there aren't that many interesting decisions. Once you're equipped and your character's unique abilities are set, turns pretty much come down to the same decision - move twice, battle twice, move and battle, or be on guard. The game is one mass of fights (a fight being one simple dice roll, so at least they're quick), wading through all the baddies that the DM is setting up to stop you getting through your scenario fast. Meaning the DM arguably has the more interesting decisions - how and when to deploy - but the adventurers have the more interesting thematic ride, not knowing what's coming their way until it's sprung. Pros and cons. I can see why it's successful, and I'd play again to see if different scenarios provide a different experience, but it's way too long and not interesting enough to come out more than occasionally.

Entretenido. Le falta algo que le sobra a su primo RuneBound (este es inmersivo) y a su hermano Doom (este es rápido y al grano). Las cartas de mercado son un poco limitadillas. Con las dos primeras expansiones el despliegue de cosillas por la mesa es un poco confuso (demasiados tokens), me imagino que con RtL será aún peor, pero supongo que esta última expansión le dará ese toque de aventura que echo de menos en el básico.

Con las reglas que me he apañado para hacer automático al Overlord, el juego ha mejorado bastante. Los escenarios son siempre diferentes y, lo mejor, no tengo que hacer siempre de malo... ;-)

This dungeon crawl is the best. A good variety of characters. Nice set of simple yet amazingly good rules. The combat dice are a good invention.
The downside is that the game gets a bit easy after you progressed into the quest.

RATING: 8.5
The introductory adventure was heavily weighted in favour of the adventurers but the others have been much more even. Satisfies that 'rpg urge' without the lengths of a campaign (though on some adventures it's a close run thing!). Quality pieces, entertaining game

The first edition has been supplanted with second edition, however, first edition is still a great delver, and there are now some unofficial second edition variants which allow the use of many of the first edition components, and even the playing of first edition quests using second edition rules.

Regardless, however, first edition is still one of the best delvers, and I have many great memories of getting punished by a ruthless overlord player.

RATING: 7
A fun romp through a dungeon with many interesting things to do and sufficient balance of random actions and strategy to make the game fun.  It's also accessible to just about anyone (my son loves it) and is a good game to introduce newbies with a flair for fantasy to.

Yes, the treasures can be unbalanced.  Yes, with four heroes many of the scenarios can be a bit too much of a cakewalk.  But it's still a very, very fun cakewalk.  About the only real minus I find is the amount of time it takes, with a particular focus on setup and tear-down.  We've actually gotten other games in while one or two other people are getting this one ready.  But it's typically worth the wait.

2/8/11 - My first time playing it with my friends. We played the second mission with the troll brothers and we lost. I knew this game would be a big hit with the guys and I was right. The miniatures are great and the game captures the feel of a good old D&D dungeon crawl. I look forward to trying this game again. I'd rate it a 9 right now.

4/10/11 - Second time around and I am starting to see some of the quirkiness of the rules. This still is the best dungeon crawl game I have played. I think an 8 is a good rating for this game.

RATING: 8
I've played this quite a few times with players aged 7 to 50 and we've always had a great time.  A great value for the price considering the sheer volume of components provided in the game.  This game does a wonderful job of capturing the 'hack and slash' feel of Dungeons and Dragons dungeon crawls from your teen years.  Really great game.  I would venture to say, best in the Fantasy Adventure style map games... I've tried a lot of them as you can see.  This is the only one I liked well enough to paint the set.

RATING: 7.5
Based on one play: This game is quite fun. The theme is well done and the immersion works great. It does not go as far as D&D I am told, but for those who like dungeon crawlers and who just want to play one game at a time, it is a lot of fun and there is a lot of variety.

I am wearing my blown-away face. The figures can hardly be called miniatures cos the monsters are Freakin MASSIVE. Gameplay is well thought out and atmospheric. I can't wait to get Road to Legend to enable proper campaign play, but wow !

Ok dungeon crawling game. Fairly engaging and entertaining for the first hour or so. Has some problems with balance and takes a really long time to play. Half the people I talk to about the game says the balance favors the players and the other half claims weight toward the Overlord. In both my plays the OL killed us half way through the dungeon and we were constantly fighting to stave off defeat. Kind of frustrating at times when it seems as though you are only playing to try and hold off inevitable defeat. NOT AN RPG! Kind of rediculous with some rules like dying, returning to life in town and jumping back into the dungeon in one round, which I'm guessing is about 1 minute in game world time. It is like running through a dungeon killing things as fast as you can. Don't stop or the monsters will just get tougher and there will be more of them! "Hey guys, some more monsters just spontaneously generated in the room we just cleared out and are attacking from behind." I also hate it when it is strategically in your favor to get killed in a game. Healing is too difficult and slow. I could continue to complain about this game. I have played it twice now and could be talked into it again, but definitely not one of my favorite games.

RATING: 8
Excellent! Been waiting for a dungeon crawling game since Warhammer Quest and Descent fills up that gap just nicely. While not as "campaign-y" as Warhammer, the amount of player to Dm interaction is impressive and I especially like the idea of using threat tokens to play Overlord cards. Each scenario is playable in about 3-4 hours which makes it a very manageble to table.

Lots of fun with the right group.  It may tend to drag on with newer or more cautious players though.  Beating up monsters and find sweet loot is fun, but in the games that I've played, stuff just takes too long.  The character classes aren't particularly well-balanced, with the fighter-classes being much more powerful than mages or rogues.  The higher conquest value does not make up for the differences.

2-5. Fantasy Dungeon-Crawl. Moderne versie van HeroQuest. Duurt lang. Duur maar prachtig.

RATING: 6
Pros:
+Amazing amount of miniatures.
+Tons of missions to explore.
+A lot of replay value.
+Theme is well done and the artwork looks nice.
+Modular board.
+Fun to "level up" and gain new equipment/gear.

Cons:
-Long setup time.
-The Overlord can drag this game on for way too long.
-Game can be too long at times. I get bored with it after 4 hours.
-The Overlord is MUCH too powerful with only 2-3 characters (players). You need to play 4 characters every time.
-Players can become overpowered fairly quickly.

Wow got my copy of decent today. Game looks great but there are a few things that spoil it a little bit in my opinion. (1) The horrible plastic door stands look out of place with the rest of the game, did the designers not see warhammer quest? And even heroquest did a better job (2) some of the minis are mounted on massive round bases and some of the bases are warped. Did someone at FFG look at the final game and say “that looks cool” cos if so they need a kick up the bum. Still I should be able to fix it. The game it's self is MAGICAL one of the best dungeon crawls I have ever played.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A combination of Doom and Runebound. Thematically more close to runebound but the mechanics are clearly from Doom: The Boardgame.
I didn't really like Doom but this one was awesome experience. Not as good as some other FFG big box games but still extremely enjoyable. Well, this could be the best of the bigboxes, don't know yet...

The one thing I dislike a bit is the time limit. When the overlord deck exhausts, -3 conquest points, which is sometimes a lot! Well, this is absolutely better than in Doom. Since in Doom, if I remember correctly, it's instant defeat. -3 conquest points is a reasonable solution! Well, at the overlord's point of view, time limit is not so bad after all.

Another debatable issue is that if an attack misses (chances are 1/6) then it's completely missed and no way to reverse it unless attacking again. I began to like that. Because now you can't rely on building up your damage values and always score something. Makes the game a lot more exciting and aim/dodge useful!

A good thing is that there are quests varying from easy to hard, short to long. And anyone can create his own quest too. Some experienced players may even improvise the quest while playing, but that might be off-balanced quite sure... well, at least it is an option!

There is a lot to explore in this game. With all its expansions (so long, money...) it will really be a great experience with replayability rating 99%. At first I didn't appreciate this game too much, but after the second game, I began to understand its beauty and tactical possibilities.

FFG sure is the boardgame world's Blizzard: that company knows how to make a hit game for everyone to enjoy!

Edit: Counting the number of base game quests. Expansion quests / Road to Legend sessions counted in their own sites.

See Road to Legend.  Both sets hold their own merits.  If you want to play for a single evening, just break out the base game.  If you want to follow the adventures as a family or with a gaming group, bust out RtL expansion.

Love this game and would rate it higher except that it takes too long to play.  We have discussed breaking scenarios into chunks, I think that would help.  Our games seem to go 8-10 hours, and that is a bit much for everyone's attention span.  Maybe it will get a bit shorter as we get better at it.  The tension is fun and the "surprises" of traps/monsters/treasure are really exciting.  So far in the early scenarios it seems like the OL doesn't have much chance, but I hear that gets better too.

The mother of all Dungeon Crawlers. This game has a lot of variety and a ton of components. I have had games that ended prematurely, so heroes be advised to play it safe in the first stages, a lucky overlord will crush you should you go into the dungeon too fast. A regular game will go for several hours, so have that in mind. I takes time to get some of the rules down for first time players, but it is not too complex of a game. The combat options may overwhelm some, and the overlord will have some heavy mind work to do to maximize his possibilities. Great game for advanced players or people that really like the fantasy setting.

Ok, I like Descent a lot, but I don't feel it's challenging enough for the heroes.. (unless we're playing it wrong)  A good friend has purchased this game and we have had some good times playing it, but it sure does take a while.  Part of me thinks, "this is probably better as a video game", and the other part thinks, "grinding through dungeons with my buddies is fun!"
Still, this game gets points for being amazingly well produced (as one expects nowadays from a Fantasy Flight game), with great bits, a good system for player-created dungeons, and a great base for adventure.  But, my friends, let me warn you now - this game takes forever and a day to play.  Seriously.  I wish I was 14 again, because that's probably the best age demographic that will have both the time and attention span to truly appreciate this monster.

This game is really pleasant to play, the game system is quite identical to the doom's boardgame so you learn two while playing one, i've played with 8-10 years old children and it seems quite approachable (usually after 4 hours they start to play with miniatures completely ignoring the game), it takes some times to setup and it's better to have a spare table to leave all on.

Other dungeon crawlers do the 1 vs many experience smoother, or more clever, but none capture the epic feeling that Descent 1 delivers. On top of that, oddly, because this came earlier than other dungeon crawlers, the setup for the game is actually a very smooth experience. Character creation is a breeze even compared to Descent 2.

Finally got around to playing it, and yeah, it's long to set up, but it is pretty fun.  I see the compareson to Warhammer Quest, but I think WHQ is a little more fleshed out and role-play-ish.  I've heard Road to Legend adds this element, and I think that'll be our next expansion.  But, as I said, we had a good time with it.  It seems pretty tough for the Overlord to win, at least on the first quest.  Heroes won with like 12 conquest points.  Not much of a penalty for death, but that's cool.  Overall, I like it.  It's pure Ameritrash, but it is what it is.  I prefer something a tiny bit more cerebral, but I'd play again.  Solid.

I think that this will remain one that I enjoy mostly with my kids, although we played with two of my "adult" game groups (with the kids, too) and it went over well.

The modular map is nice.

Very well balanced, considering all the elements. I believe each side has at least the feeling of a chance of winning, if not a real chance for each of the two quests I have played so far. This is with 3 heros.

Overbloated dungeon crawling, with decent mechanics. Good with gamers, but too heavy for casual players, and feels too much like work to set up and play. So all the chrome actually sucks the fun out of game somewhat, and takes way too much time to play through a single scenario for normal gaming night.

RATING: 6
I'm a co-op gamer at heart, which means Descent doesn't hit the table as often as other games. It is quite fun, but it plays up the confrontation between two sides like no other game on my shelf. We did paint some of the minis, which makes it a bit more special.

Automated Overlord variants can be quite entertaining, but they're more like puzzle games at that point. Group puzzle games with fireballs.

18/08/2007: Played this once during my first local boardgaming meetup session. Took a melee character and unleashed a whole lot of destruction! I have purchased a copy for myself, and am enjoying being the Overlord! :D

2/12/2007: Played it many times with 2 groups, and everyone loved this game. Rating upgraded to 9.5 (would have been a 10, if not for the overpowered gold items)

27/03/2013: Downgraded rating to 8, in view of the really overpowered gold items (and no, I don't believe in house ruling or excluding them from the game totally)

10/04/2013: House ruling is probably the only thing that can save this game from the imbalance arising from including the gold treasures. What works to keep the intensity is to totally exclude them from the game -- doing that seems to make a hero win more fulfilling based on experience.

Played this at my local game club and enjoyed it very much. It reminded me of HeroQuest. In my opinion, a few game mechanics too many and not enough random element triggers too make the game more non-tactic dependent. But still, I am looking forward to playing this more and maybe owning at some point.

OK, so I've never played a non-solo game, but even solo I've had a blast. I think there's a solid game in there, I only need the people to play with.    Unfortunately I think the complexity and time factor is a major turn off for most of my gaming victims (I would never impose this on my non-gamer friends, which leaves my family...most of whom do not like complex and overly long games).  Still, my boys love playing with it (by their "rules" of course), which is an added bonus.

This is one of the toughest games I've ever rated.
On the one hand, it's a high-quality fantasy game with different adventures to dungeoncrawl to, on the other hand it is hard to remember all the rules, is too long for what it is, and is unbalanced (heroes spiral up in strength while monsters get left behind).
I will postpone an in-depth comment until my boys grow up and can play the game with me the way it's intended.

My first impression was "action RPG boardgame". Funny I would think that it was an action game when our first session was 6 hours long. But hey, that whole 6 hours saw very little downtime for the heroes. I made sure of that =)

It had good production value in the bits,  Perhaps there was too much to manage.  Turns take far too long.  Could not finish in the time we had.  I have been playing various editions of D&D steadily and regularly since the 90's, often and currently as the DM.  I see no reason to play this game rather than play D&D.  This game limits all the players and the DM far too much.

I enjoy Descent a lot. It has lots of nice looking pieces and quality design. The only downfall I've experienced is the game's balance. The game is almost always a blowout for the heroes or the Overlord. We're still working at finding a middle ground.

The 2nd edition killed our playing of this.

Sold.

RATING: 8
The classic modern Dungeon Crawl. Casting the “Overlord” into a competitive role with the dungeon-delving Heroes was a nice touch that works very well to keep all of the players on their toes. Major flaws are that play length can be 3-4 hours and there are a lot of pieces to track. For anyone not scared off by those, this is worth a look.

I enjoy Descent, but for the amount of time it takes, I'd probably rather play something else.

The problem for me is that the heroes spend their time strategizing for the optimal set of actions and I lack the patience either as a hero or the overlord, so I mentally check out after a bit.

I might enjoy it more with a chess clock to keep the heroes time shorter - and put them under pressure.

It's as close to 'Hero Quest' as you're going to get.  The game adds many few features from it's predecessor, including an interesting range of character classes and abilities.  I  find the snapping board titles to be a little fickle, but that's about the only down side.

RATING: 8
 Finally got my copy and it satifies many of my fantasy, quest and adventure gaming needs. Uses the same game system as Doom the board game but with better elements. So far after 6 plays I have found that the game leans haevily in favour for the Heroes to win, quite opposite to Doom the boardgame which uses a similar game system. I really like the product, minis, and game mechanicis but it needs a lot of tweeking in order for the Overlord to have any chance of winning the game. I as Overlord felt more like I was a spectator, placing minis on the board from turn to turn and throwing a few dice if and when any of the monsters survived the onslaught from the hugely kitted out heroes. So my rating went down to 7 because of some boredom issues for my part in the game. Back upto 8.

Great theme, but balanced on a pin. The first card draws of the game decide if you'll pass this game like a breeze or if you're going to be stuck in the first room and die there. There must be a better way to design games like this. A waste of cardboard and plastic. And, twice, of my time.

(8/26/08) - For the past few weeks I had a weird hankering to try D&D. I knew this had been described as "D&D Lite" so I figured it would be a good starting point. The extremely high price point dissuaded me from buying it at the time. Thankfully Cardhaus was having a massive clearance sale and I was able to get it for ~$40 off of the usual price!

(10/10/08) - Played this for the first time today. Holy hell does this game take a lot of time. The introductory scenario is heavily skewed toward the heroes, so as the Overlord I didn't have much of a chance of winning. I think the rule that allows the heroes to see everything in a room they've just entered ruins the tension. Despite this, I would like to give this another shot at some point.

(04/23/13) - Descent has been sold as part of a generalized liquidation of my collection. I would have liked to play it more with the right group, but was never able to find one.

Excellent value for the price. Like it's precurser DOOM: the board game, Descent has excellent production values.

It's like a D&D campaign light in a board game, espically if you use the Road to Legends expansion which turns it into an ongoing story/game with skys the limit.

Warning!: Do not Approach Descent unless you and your gaming group have about 8 hours to throw away! This game can go on and on, but it's moderately good fun besides that.

As many times as I read and re-read this rulebook, I still feel like I must be missing something.  This game seemed to exist for the MMO player who could never stomach the concept of death or defeat and who needed to be able to beat any challenge as long as they were willing to grind away enough of their time.  Enless respawns just felt cheesy.  I'd rather play new parties in Warhammer Quest on their very first dungeon, wherein there is a 75% of failure IF the party has a wizard and a 90% chance of failure if they don't.  At least that's got some suspense.

The 10 rating is not for vanilla Descent but instead is for what the game has grown into once all the excellent expansions have been bought.

The base game is too long and everyone I've gotten to play the Overlord has had a very poor opinion of that side of the game.

I found a number of things unacceptable:
1.  The Undying characters should have some limit to their life (dying spiral - return with 1 then 2 then 3 damage, or just limit to two resurrections) - after the 6th resurrection of a sorcerer I was ready to go home.
2.  Invalidate the "Characters can't trade card."  All game we had crap for equipment and suddenly we might have gotten useful items if we could trade, but this card was played.  I laughed at all the reviews that talked about how silver and gold items make the characters unstoppable.  We sold practically every item we got.
3.  Corollary to 2:  When allowed to buy items, and buying an item in town the characters should draw two cards and get to choose one.
4.  I think the game takes too long versus the problem of balance.

Analysis Paralysis: the game, it's very tactical but a bit too much luck-based so you always need a plan B when planning & coordinating , which leads to more paralysis, and longer downtime for the overlord. 

Each game is very long by itself, and one of the indirect goals of the Overlord is to make it even longer.

Awesome miniatures, nice illustrations, it's a very well produced Boardgame, but if you want a solid high fantasy experience look for Descent second edition or games like Mageknight the boardgame, or even Super Dungeon Explorer.

25-02-2014. It's a longer version of Descent 2.0. The big question remains if Descent 1.0 is needed after Descent 2.0, and the expansions FFG is pushing out reprinting stuff for 2.0 available in 1.0.

What I love in 1.0, is the epicness of the game and the reminiscence that is stronger to RPGing. 1.0 is larger and more flexible than 2.0. The enemies are tougher and the overlord is able to spawn creatures. I am baffled why FFG decided to replace this. It seems to me an important ability he lost in 2.0, also making that game more easy to figure out. I also like the rules for armor better in 1.0. While I understand that they removed the old armor rules because they made you invincible at times in1.0, making it dice in 2.0 makes Armor very random.

The biggest problem I have with 1.0, is that 1.0 looks incredibly dated. 1.0 uses the old runebound/runewars mini's that have been completely replaced by 2.0, that are way better looking.

Bought it again (+ expansions) after REALLY enjoying Descent 2.0 and DOOM the boardgame.

Instead of erasing what I wrote before I though it would be cool to just keep adding writings to show how my thoughts have changed about this game.  Great game.  Road to Legend is awesome.

Actually, after having played several times and used a few of the variants to speed up play, the game is very enjoyable.  In fact, it has become one of our favorites.

Almost too long to play.  Our games end up taking over 5 hours and then everybody is just drained and doesn't want to play anymore, so it does not see a lot of play time. We do play at least once a month though for our ongoing campaign.  Campaign is a very cool way to play, but it throws the balance a little out of whack once the players get built up.  All the expansions are played every time.

--May2008-- A rather excellent refinement of the Doom mechanics.  After only one game, I don't really have a feel as to the overall balance of the game - but it seems (naively) that it's a bit easier on the good guys.  The increased variability is very nice, and the equipment adds some great color to the proceedings.  Possibly loads of fun; and if it proves to be as good as it could be, I'll need to raise my rating.
--Dec2009-- Several more plays.  It's slow, but engrossing. Quite visually compelling for the youngsters, too.

RATING: 5
A good Dungeon crawl game, but not a 'Pick-up-Game" by any stretch of the imagination.  This is a game that needs to be announced as the main course, and readily approved by all players.  The end game is in need of a large amount of help for the Overlord, as the best way to hurt characters is by charming them.  IMO the Overlord needs 3 cards per turn, and the 'Boss' monster's stats always need to be inflated by at least 50%.  Without these mods, the Overlord is only a watered down GM playing a severely simple RPG.  My frustration eith the game grows as each time the same flaws surface and each time...  experienced players EASILY kill everything in an area.  I SO wanted to love this game.

RATING: 10
This and World of Warcraft: The Board Game are my two ultimate favorite board games. Though, they both take a long time to play. I save these for all day (or all night) gaming sessions with a group of people. Descent does work with only 2 people, but it works so much better with at least 3. Even with the recent announcement of the 2nd edition, I don't plan to sell or trade this since I love it so much. I may have to consider picking up the 2nd edition and the conversion kit when they come out though.

Laying out the dungeon speeds play but here are a few ideas if you want to lay out the board as you play:
* Lay out the dungeon in advance, before the players come. Then put each room in labeled baggies. Label each baggie by Area number. You can include the miniatures and tokens in the baggies.
* Lay out part of the dungeon. Take a break after every two or so battles (they can get long!) and lay out the next two or so areas during the break.

Also:
* Buy a plano box (a plastic box with small areas) to hold the bits. I think a 15-section box works fine.
* Download "The Rescue" from the FFG site. It's a good introductory adventure. The first adventure in the Quest book is long and uses as many miniatures as it can from the set. IMO, You don't need really need to do that in your first game of Descent.

This is a tabletop, map-driven, tactical role playing board-game with miniatures.  One person will take on the role of all the baddies, while the rest play the heroes.  The map is modular and grid based, and the dice mechanic is novel and very quick, one throw of the dice tell you if you hit, and for how much damage.  It's a great hack-and-slash roleplaying came which you can play without any roleplaying, however story does matter in this game as each scenario is backed by some kind of important backstory.

I quite enjoyed the two games I had, but they dragged on endlessly. 5 hours of quarrelling what is the best move and cursing dice rolls is too much for me, I'd much rather play Runewars instead.

Another degree of Evolution from [i]Advanced HeroQuest[/i], FFG takes the [i]Doom[/i] engine and applies it to old skool fantasy to scratch that tactical D&D (or perhaps more appropriately, Final Fantasy) itch.  It does its job admirably well, although I wonder about the wisdom of using the brilliant dice mechanic to "streamline" things, and then gunk it all back up again with enough chrome to choke Lightning McQueen.

RATING: 7
I haven't given this a score, as I have only been the overlord. I have found that this game drags a little tho, even on the first quest, but to be fair, we usually play it til late

EDIT: I have played as a hero since, and do enjoy it. It plays a lot slower than 2nd Edition, but has a more Epic feel.

I like how in this one it's possible (and likely) for the bad guys to win.  So instead of being a DM, you're actually playing against the other players and trying to beat them

I really liked playing this game (3 players and one gm).  The combat system is designed to be fast but dynamic, using different combinations of dice to represent different weapons.  The pieces are outstandanding.  This is the way I wish D&D would play.  

The main drawback I see was the amount of time it took to play, and the cost and size of the game (our game took something like 11 hours).  Setup time is also a drawback.

Make/order extra dice if possible (they are custom for the game).  The game doesn't include enough.

Balance seems completely out of whack, and the game has a tendency to drag if the heroes spend too much time discussing their turn. But it's a fun game that throws tons and tons of interesting tactical decisions and opportunities for creative play at you. Also, the fact that you're actually a player rather than a mere game host as the dungeon master is a plus.

RATING: 9
Cant' get enough of this. The rules work well, and it's fun to be the Overlord or one of the heroes. My one complaint is the artwork on the hero cards which is inappropriate if you play this as a family game with young kids. We cover up the hero portraits with the wound and fatigue markers. The expansion quests get very tough for the heroes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I pretty much managed to avoid this game for a long while because it didn't really appeal to me.  The whole idea of a gamemaster that plays "against" the other players just doesn't seem right to me.  

I am very happy to have finally played the game because it is a very enjoyable experience.  It captures a lot of what I enjoyed about playing D&D/AD&D back in the day.  The whole crawling through a dungeon, killing monsters, and looking for treasure is a lot of fun.  I would be more than happy to play again.

That said, it really is a dicefest.  That's fine, as long as you are not expecting it to be something else.  I'm still not satisfied with the overlord (or whatever) implementation playing to make the players fail as it leads to some rather silly, "gamey" events, which to me detract from the overall experience.  Not sure what to do about that, though.  

Overall, though, I'm happy with the experience.  I wish it were a little cheaper, but I can see as something I would be happy to play when the opportunity presents itself. [02/14/2009]

O jogo é gigante é dá o maior trabalhão.
Montar o cenário demorou quase meia hora. 
Completamente desequilibrado, os heróis matam quase todos os monstros com um acerto. 
Jogar como Overlord é até divertido.
Demora horas, eu dividi a partida em quatro sessões, uma para cada área do mesmo cenário e mesmo assim levei uns dois dias. 
Tudo meio bagunçado, as regras não são muitas mas são difíceis de lembrar.
A nota alta vai pelos componentes e seu pelo potencial criativo.
O sistema parece ser muito bom para ser adaptado e melhorado.
Oferece muitos recursos, parece uma oficina de aventuras. 

The game is huge and gives a lot of work.
Set the scene took me almost half an hour. 
Completely unbalanced, the heroes kill almost all monsters with one hit. 
To play as Overlord is kind of fun. 
It takes hours, I split the match in four sessions, one for each area of the same scenario and still took me a couple of days to complete.
Messy all around, not many rules but they are somehow difficult to remember.
I'm giving a high note by the components and it's creative potential. 
The system seems to be excellent to adapt and improve on your way. Offers many features, like a workshop of adventures.

One of my favorite games, though it's hard to bring to the table sometimes. Lots of replayability, lots of options.

[1 play] This was a fun romp, nostalgic of my days of D&D from the early 80's - but better, since it all took place in one evening instead of consuming days, weeks, and months. This is a well constructed condensation of role playing, character building, and monster slaying. Excellent components . A fun system I would enjoy doing now and then.

Most recent play 7-13-07 with  Michael, Mike, Corey, and Alex.

I uhmmm and ahhh for weeks, stopping each time to drool, trying to think if I'd really play a 4 hour dungeoncrawl. I mean, I've only played Doom once (and I've owned it for 6 months now).

Then comes Christmas and I caved.

UPDATE: The first quest took 5 hours (including rules explanations). Ouch. I think that 2-3 hours would be ideal as players attentions start to wane.

There's a neat system (similar to Doom but not as strealined as people are making it out to be) and alot going in there (perhaps too much?).

FFG should release 'mini-quests'?

I will have a hard time convincing my friends to play the harder scenarios. $130 down the drain?

RATING: 5
This game is tedious to play; hours of play will leave everyone feeling like hardly anything has happened. I think this is probably due to the incesant spawning of monsters; its too bad because I really like the idea of a dungeon-master vs. the players - but this game is too cumbersome to fit that bill. Oh well.

RATING: 5.75
Played once. I appreciate the theme and the quality of the components. I really like the way the dice are used in this game. The tactical decisions can be interesting. But the rules are overly complex, slowing the game down and reducing the excitement factor. Even though everybody else had played several times before, we stopped the game to look up specific rules at least a dozen times during the one game I played. Although I understand it in terms of game balance and design, it bothered me that death in Descent means time to go shopping in town. It would be more exciting if death caused player elimination, or at least character elimination like in Arkham Horror.

A very complex and involved (in a good way) Dungeon Crawl game, with a twist - the player who acts as the "Overlord" (Game Master) is ACTIVELY trying to win and destroy the heroes.

I bought this on recommendation but took an almost instant dislike to it. Although I can tolerate playing the overlord, I find that many of the hero's are unplayable because they're so slow and have too few movement points. Half the time I'm left wondering why I bothered as they move a couple of spaces and my turn ends. I feel this drags things out far too much and slows the game down as you try and strategically spend 19 turns getting ready to open a door. This game sucks.

Életerő és fáradtság. Mágusok, harcosok, íjjászok és ezek keverékei. Különböző fajok, rettentő sok szörny és végtelen sok kazamata, amely több különböző laprészletből építhető. Sok alapkaland, de könnyű újakat találni és kitalálni így az újrajátszhatósági faktora kiemelkedő. Egy játékos a kalandmester, aki a többi játékos alkotta csapatot próbálja legyőzni a szörnyek és csapdák segítségével. Nem igazán az én játékom, ezért a 7-es értékelés, de nagyon jó szórakozás lehet összeszokott csapatnak kiegészítőivel együtt.

I consider it an average dungeon crawl...a good challenge for the heroes and gets even harder with the expansions, which give the game more depth and longer playability. The Overlord spawns enemies all the time, but that's his main strategy. The length of the game goes too long.

Well I was kinda thrown to the wolves in this one. We played two on one vs. a ruthless dungeon master and I gotta say, my butt still hurts from the beating we took that night. The game was really fun but at times kinda seems un-even when you got 12 monsters coming and beating up on your poor little helpless mage. She never stood a chance!

It is difficult for me to give a fair opinion of this game.  Certainly with the right people this can be fun, and the system is strikingly clean and easy to understand.  It really boils down the new style of d20 dungeon crawls into primal elements, and really does a great job of recreating an "adventure".  But as someone that actually plays RPGs this feels like just the framework to a house, a good solid frame, but you don't really want to live there.

The reason that RPG's are fun is that you can do anything creative that you want.  I walk into a room there is a big lizard and I release 5 chickens.  The lizard runs around confused trying to get the chickens now I've got the drop on it, etc.  But in Descent you stock yourself up with whatever would make you get the best rolls on the dice.  Soon you are just munchkining out rolling obscene amounts of damage.  The first thing you do is run to the chest, see if anything in it will help you beat the bad guys then whack 'em.  There are some tactics certainly, but most of the battles come down to:  

I'm going to shoot my bow. 
[Roll] 
Did it get arrowed? 
No.  
I'll try again. 
[Roll]
Yup, you did one heart worth of damage.
I'll use a fatigue.
Ok, roll again.
[Roll]
One more damage, he gets a heart.
One more fatigue.
[Roll]
Nope, didn't work this time. 
Darn, your turn.

Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat. 

To me there is nothing more tedious than listening to a role-player retell their past gaming adventures.  After the first few minutes you realize this is going to be a long "story" that does nothing to add to your life experience.  

The biggest flaw of the game is that you don't really care if your character dies.  Something seems wrong about that to me.

Now that said, because of the downtime, the system is conducive for friends to sit around for 8 hours and just gab, while playing something light and incidental.  If I were to equate this to anything I would say that this is the geek version of sports parties where buddies all go over to watch the game and really just use it as an excuse to hang out with each other while something entertaining occupies the dead space.  There are moments of excitement, and certainly with the right group this can be fun, but if you want something stimulating or short look elsewhere.

I can't imagine wanting to play this more that once or twice.

Being a DnD-player I really, really wanted to like this, but I don't. It's long and tedious and involves lots of "then I go there and use my sword and you drink one potion and give me the other potion..." I'm more of a "Charge! Huzzah!"-person and get very bored if all the moves have to be carefully thought out.

A blast of a game.  Reminds me of the special times in my past where I played D&D with some of my closest friends.  It seems like each adventure lends itself to the fact that characters's decisions (and monsters) develop a story that will differ in each session. Soaked in theme and has awesome components.

A lot of teamwork is required, and it's fun to watch the Overlord conjure up challenges to throw at you!

Played many times and love the games.  
I feel like it is a different game than Descent 2 ,which I slightly prefer, but not different enough to justify buying my own copy.
I prefer campaign style games so I would need to add Road to Legend to get the best of it.
Descent 2 did streamline and change several areas of gameplay that I feel were distinct improvements particularly the class system of D2.

Blatantly unbalanced, repetitive, no strategy or tactics to speak of, and the dungeon itself is not that interesting.  I do love the theme, though.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
After 3-4 plays, I'm just not very impressed. The game always seems to be imbalanced one way or the other, with the losing side having to trudge on for an hour or more after it's obvious who's going to win. The theme is a generic FRP kind of thing, with no real backstory or narrative to it. The gameplay is linear, with the one or two best choices usually fairly obvious to all.

Completely replaced, for my money, by Arkham Horror, which is better in every way (minus the minis, of course).

There are so many things I love about this game. It's just a great game to play with a group of friends who enjoy a good dungeon crawl. Is it perfectly balanced? Should they have added campaign rules? Could it take less time to play? Who cares! It's just amazing fun and for me that's all that matters. I'm a sucker for treasure, leveling up, beating up monsters and any game with a trillion little plastic pieces. :)

RATING: 4
Played 10+  times

The atmosphere is great. The bits are great, the theme is great. Character management is fun. Combat is fine.

Game progression is out of whack. The first part of the game feels just right. The heroes must work together, and there is a real sense of danger. The game tilts as the heroes gain treasures. This is a real problem. The toughest monsters are no match for the toughest treasures. End game often has the heroes waltzing into a room, using an uber-item, and watching dragons and giants disintegrate.

For the overlord to win, he must delay the heroes in order to cycle through the deck and remove conquest tokens. This results in heroes fighting wave after wave of weak spawned monsters. The monsters have no hope of killing the heroes after they obtain silver and gold armor. So, battles become incredibly repetitive and tedious for both the overlord and heroes. 

As overlord, I often find myself NOT spawning creature after hours of repetitive fighting, just to get the game over with. I still must sit through the rest of it just to get to the inevitable ending where the heroes finally reach a room full of dragons and creatures that might actually pose a threat. But alas, they really don't pose a threat because by the time the heroes get that far they have such powerful uber items that they just waltz into the final room, use their, "Rune of immediate disintegration of all creatures ever invented or imagined within three solar systems" and game over.

The 2nd edition totally eliminates all the negatives from this first edition, keeps the good stuff, and adds some pure awesomeness.

RATING: 8
I had never gotten around to opening this until recently and I have to say I was very surprised. The game isn't as difficult to learn as I expected, has great components and is a blast to play. The play time is a tad long (depends on how much "planning" the adventurers do), but doesn't feel any worse than a game of AD&D. In fact, I'd venture to call this "AD&D Lite."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
With the addition of Road to Legends this game goes up significantly in replayability and fun. Now the overlord actually has a goal other than the typical kill the heroes and gives the game a much better feel than a one off dungeon crawl.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
An airing of grievances:

1) Takes 3-4 hours to barrel through a full scenario, not including the time it takes to set up and break down.

2) There's no sense of drama or mounting tension. Adventures always start out tough on the players, and once they grab silver/gold items it's a cakewalk from there on out. The end game seems to drag on endlessly as the mists of story and atmosphere dissipate, revealing a  clunky hack-and-slash dice-off.

3) No control over character advancement. Characters don't actually improve; they just loot more powerful swag. Goodies are drawn randomly from various Treasure Decks which often leads to situations where characters will draw completely useless items (i.e. melee fighters drawing Runes), thereby not advancing their power level and making further reaches of the dungeons even more of a grind.

4) LOS spawning system is very, very irritating. Example: Our party once spent forty-five minutes of real time clearing the baddies out of a room with a single door only to walk through that doorway, lose LOS into that room, and then watch in horror as hordes of skeletons marched out of it the following turn. This makes no sense and guts any sense of accomplishment you might get from smashing bad guys.

For a game that tries to do so much, it's disheartening to see it fall short. I've read that the expansions improve on the base game quite a bit, but until the dude in our group who owns Descents picks any of them up, I've got to stick this rating. For the time you've got to put in to make this work, I'd rather play D&D.

This is a long game, and it takes a while to wrap your head around the dice, but it sped up as we went. It's fun if you're in a hack and slash mood. I'll play it again. I adjusted my rating versus my Runebound rating because I liked this game more.

I love it, and if the playtime was a bit shorter it would probably be my favorite game of all.  Heroquest was my game when I was little, and now HQ grew up and here it is.  My wife and I are in the middle of painting all the minis for this wonderful game.  The campaign rules created with Road to Legend are awesome.  One of my favorite games of all time.  Just wish I could play it more. *update* - I've considered selling this off with all my Imperial Assault stuff to play.  I just don't see myself cracking open Descent again.  Times have changed!

I'm a huge RPG fan and I even love RPG video games so this game is exactly my cup of tea.  The only negative is the play time.

03/21/09: Finally got to play, although only a partial run through of the initial dungeon.  The heroes didn't even get to battle the giant (we started really late in the night on a whim... ha!)

Both of us (bartolbe and I) really dug it -- definitely playing again soon!

Update 04/19/09:  Ok, so three full games in the bag now, me playing overlord each time.  I'm enjoying it a lot, though the downtime while four players figure out their moves can be a bit annoying.  The players, for their part, seem to have really like it a lot.  I've had 8 different people, and everyone gave it thumbs up.

I think it's going to be a pretty firm 7.5 -- I'd rate it higher, but the playing time (and down time) mean it just can't and won't make the table all that often.  There are too many excellent games out there that a four-hour epic just won't see as much play.

Absolutely fantastic game about dungeon crawling. If you like these types of games, but you're tired or too much dice rolling and luck factor (DungeonQuest, Talisman, Runebound...) then DESCENT is your game.

A lot of tactics and strategy with just enough luck. With the Advanced Campaig expansions (Road to Legend or Sea of Blood) it even goes further creating an ongoing campaign game for the players.

Absolutely recommended for dungeon RPG fans and any other looking for a crawler where you need to use your brain.

This game is one of my favorites. It's definitely not for everyone. It takes a lot of time to set up and hours upon hours to learn all the ins and outs of the gameplay. Once you have mastered the game it still takes hours upon hours to play. The included quests are fun but in my opinion, this game was meant to be homebrewed to fit you and your "game nerd" friends' needs. It allows for tons of creativity (mini painting, expanding, story telling, quest creation, etc.) Best when played while jamming some pagan style fantasy metal like; Nightwish, Turisas, Alestorm, or Korpiklaani. Descent is a fun, fantasy-ish, dungeon romp.

Soooooo much potential.  This giant box easily holds the components but it is overflowing with dungeon crawl goodness.  The balance is truly horrible as once the heroes get some good gear, they can’t be stopped, and the sessions run can run painfully long, but there is no match in the genre.  The balance issues and the much too long playtime drop this form a 10 to an 8.  The advanced campaign, Road to Legend or Sea of Blood fixes some of these issues and when played with either of these the rating is a 9 approaching a 10.

You know, this is actually a good RPG-style, very well-produced game that is a worthy successor to Hero Quest.  But as is the case with most of these games, it's HUGE and a bummer to clean up.  It's not a casual game, and it has balance issues.  With 4 players the game is far too easy.

After looking at this game for over two years, I finally went ahead and picked it up. In retrospect, I wish I'd bought it 2 years ago. Nice resource management - fatigue for the heroes, threat for the overlord - in a wonderful tactical combat game. Ignore the 'rpg/adventure' trappings. Descent is a lovely exercise in purely confrontational asymmetrical sides. I will play this any time.

Update: The more I play this game, the more I enjoy it. I find myself thinking about it an unhealthy amount of the time, heh.

[6 plays] I entered this game knowing it is just be a fun adventure game and not a hardcore strategy game.  I can enjoy this type of a game as a change of pace of my regular euro-strategy.  The game was fun to play.  Probably the fun factor was at least a 7.0 but the scenarios take 5.5-7.5 hours!  To me that is a very long time.  No matter how fun it is that is just a long time.  My ratings reflect my desire to play the game again so I have to dock it for the length because it is just hard to want to play a game that takes this long very often. I have played mostly as a hero but have been the OL a couple times now.

RATING: 7
[FFG 05 edition] {Fantasy adventure; dice-rolling, scenario, modular board, fighting, devil vs. angel} I like RPG games. Therefore, I am particularly interested in adventure game. However, it's really not easy to find decent adventure games because it's difficult to design and needs many expansions / add-ons to have good replay values. Usually, adventure games work better at computers.

Descent comes under my radar. It looks nice and gorgeous. It also interests because the role of Overlord - it seems like DM and has rival teams. Besides, it should have better replayability for its scenario construction (like Settlers), many heroes and skills. I am happy that I have bought it because it's a really decent adventure game: full of fun, thematic and supporting role-playing; though the fun of the game depends heavily on the setup of the quest, players and Overload.

The game system is effective and it really supports interaction between players and Overlord. So far, the skills are limited. I expect more and more expansions will be released.

I hope that Descent supports more players so that we can more adventure experience. I also hope that each hero can have different roles / attributes other than different abilities or stats so that a better teamwork can be fostered (some tasks need different heroes to complete). Further, I hope that heroes can be non-human so that some heroes may have special ability or weakness. Can there any invisible monsters / traps too? Umm, adding all these will make Descent become an AD&D game ...

[Expansions] Both expansions are good to have. They add new capability, fun and strategies to the basic game.

Want to like it more, but it feels claustrophobic and cold. Oddly enough, the lavish production spoils it for me. The thing that drew me to RPGs was the use of my imagination and the images I conjured up in my head. No hunk of plastic can replace that. Sadly, Descent doesn't work for me as a boardgame *or* an RPG.

RATING: 7
One of those games where the more you put into it, the more it gives in return. The Overlord MUST know the rulebook inside out, back to front for this to work properly. Fun, but hard work to boot at the moment. You know, I might just prefer Doom for personal nostalgic reasons. I need to paint the minis, and spend some quality time with the rulebook.

Update 2016 - Despite loving the look of this game, and the huge epic scale of it, I sold it. We hadn't played it in around 8 years, Imperial Assault has a better setting and is a better game, and Descent SE has taken away a lot of the fluff, and has an app to allow it to be played solo. Great game though, and I'll miss it (but I'm glad to see the enormous box go).

RATING: 4
in the foot foot library. owned by Hawksbill. What can I say about this game. Too long for what it is, lacks any real tension after the first 1/3. Seems like being the overlord player would be a real drag. The OL only really has a chance to win in the first 1/3 of the game and if he does then you just spent 30 minutes of set up for maybe 60 minutes of game play and no one had any fun. It could really benefit from shorter more managable scenarios, stronger monsters, and less powerful treasures. The whole have to go bacl to town and shop mechanic is a real drag, and seems to take away from the game play quite a bit. However, it does have a very big social upside in that when played with the right group, and one that is large enough it can be a really good beer and pretzels dungeon crawler. I just feel like the game should last for 3 beers not 9.

Descent is a very fine game and had I discovered it 15 years ago (assuming it had existed back then) I probably would have rated it an 8 or 9.  But these days I'm just not all that excited about a 4+ hour dungeon crawl.  The bits are supurb and the rules are decent (if a little long).  The game is very playable but there are some balance issues, which is to be expected in a game of this nature.  If it were an hour or two shorter I'd probably rate it a 7 but the reality is that I'm just not interested in investing the amount of time it requires.

Dungeon. Crawl. Not my thing. A very big, very long, version of not my thing. Having said that, there are one or two people who could call me and invite me over to play it, and I'd say "yeah, OK", but it's more for the socialising than the game.

It took me nearly 4 years after playing this game to rate & comment on it. Think of that as an homage.

This was one of the first big board games we picked up.  It looked so awesome but turned out to be not a good fit for us for several reasons.  The game length, heroes being too strong once they hit a few treasure chests, the whole go to town when you die thing drove me nuts.  No one wanted to be the overlord.  

I have tried Mice and Mystics and Wrath of Ashardalon for solo/coop play, but they both fell flat.  I am hoping the 2nd edition version along with a very interesting coop variant on BGG will be a good fit for my family.

RATING: 6
A great game with lots of nice components. Tactical dungeon crawling, dice rolling, character improvement. I'd rate it higher except that the downtime is very bad. The playing time is terribly long as well (at four hours for a quick game), which just makes the downtime worse. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There's a lot that's well done here; the components are fantastic, and it does a good job of getting a good dungeon crawl experience with advancement into a single session game.  However, the game runs too long and has a lot of poorly thought out mechanics and design issues.  It can still be fun, especially with some good house rules, but its painful to think of how good it could have been.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played 3+ times.  I really love the experience of getting your starting character and traipsing around in the dungeon and killing stuff and getting better weapons.  The game has a definite arc and I think it may be too steep.  The characters become super killers at the end and the monsters are basically irrelevant.  I think the monsters need to learn and get harder too.  As the Overlord, you have to be REALLY game-y to hide behind corners and jump out and focus all attacks on one character and ignore the others.  Most of the monsters end up dead before they ever do any damage.  Perhaps an extra armor once the players get silver and gold weapons. 2007/02/18

Lots of pieces!  But its in a good way!

Still playing the first scenario/quest as the Overlord while my wife plays the Hero's.  If my wife can pick it up quick, its an easy learning game!  

Some of the plastic pieces came a bit warped, but thats what you can expect from the soft plastic used for the figures.  Other than that, they are good quality as far as plastic game pieces go!

Finally my war gaming background enters in its bias against the use of squares as a primary means of movement/range calculation!  I always prefer hexes, especially for those angled shots and moves...  However, the squares do fit together to make square dungeons!  They are 1" squares...  So 25mm figures might work...  hmm...  conversion and mix and match possiblities abound!

RATING: 6
Several plays in, the game works pretty well. I enjoyed it enormously and look forward to future play-throughs. The production values are incredible and the gameplay strikes a nice balance between tactics and pure hack-n-slash dice rolling. It has the sentiment of D&D's lineage but the intuitive design and streamlining of modern board-gaming. If only that intuitive elegance extended to the rulebook and balancing rather than just the components and mechanics--Descent is no better and no worse in this sense than Arkham Horror or any other Fantasy Flight endeavor. 

Balance is wonky so far. The first two-thirds of the In the Dark were a cakewalk for the heroes. The final third saw almost all of their conquest tokens dissolved, but more through my effective use of threat and a REALLY well timed Dark Charm than anything in the dungeon--the final boss monster was taken down very quickly and the heroes were one-shotting all of my other most powerful monsters.

I've been digging through the fan-made Cataclysm series with much more success, and I will eventually work up to building my own dungeons. I also have yet to try being a hero. Despite my quibbles, if every game went about like my first run of In the Dark, I would consider my money well spent. And with better vanilla dungeons and some of the fan work out there, things are only improving.

RATING: 7
Has some very strong pros in how it really feels like an engrossing dungeon crawler, and when the tactics work, the good design of the game truly stands out.
However, a game is bound to be incredibly long mainly due to actions drawing out, not just discussing tactics, but also when resolving dice rolls and you have to factor in a thousand little details. It's a game that needs to be played, but don't let it take over your game nights.

To say that this is the game I've always wanted is an understatement. I loved Hero Quest, but always found it underwhelming.

I love D & D, but always found it overwhelming at times.

This game has the middle ground I've always wanted. Now it's not perfect, but it's close. I wish that the Quests told their difficulty level on them and that some of the monsters weren't around just to get killed.

Other than those few complaints, this is the best tactical dungeon crawling board game I've ever played. And what's best, is that being a hero or overlord is just as good.

Got the original game of this with no expansions on a semi-whim.  Rules were a lot to go through, and the online updates/FAQ were also a lot to know.  There's a lot of corner cases and things it took us awhile to get.  With that said, the actual game was quite fun.  Good old dungeon-crawler, with a dungeon keeper thrown in also.  Seemed to easy so we made it harder next mission(did make some rules mistakes as well that added to difficulty), and got clobbered.  It seems like finding the right difficulty is key to this game, and unfortunately seems like it's hard to find the perfect balance point.
Overall, enjoyed the game, might not get to play it again for awhile, but I'm sure at some point we'll bring it back out.  Did not try any expansions which is worth noting.

RATING: 9
As a kid/teenager, I played MB's HeroQuest and roleplaying games.
And just when I thought "They should do a game like HeroQuest again", FFG published DOOM and Descent.
The game looks beautiful, and compared to HeroQuest offers far more tactical depth. It was also refreshing that the Overlord is a real opponent for the hero players, and not just a storyteller or the guy to bring the hero fodder into position.
There are a lot of different characters to play (especially with the expansions), with different stats and special abilities. A lot of skills bring even more versatility, as do the different special items that are to be found in the dungeon. This all adds to the replay-value of the game. Even if you were to play the same scenario again and again,it will be with a different group of heroes every time, and they all will need their very own approach and tactics.
Some people complain about the game being too long, and I can see where they are coming from - but I don't mind playing for hours when I'm enjoying myself.

RATING: 7
We had our first run last night and I was the Overlord.  It was the first mission and they ran through it pretty easy, however we all enjoyed the playing of it.  It is difficult to be Overlord when introducing as you have that conflict of wanting to make sure the enjoy the game yet at the same time trying to kick their butts.In the end I probably went a bit too easy and they finished with 13 conquest tokens left.After a few plays we use the following house rules:1) Portals are assigned a 50gp or 100gp portal cost - the starter portal is always free2) Players choose two hero cards, get choice of their own draw first.  You can choose from ANY of the drawn cards however.3) Players must take items found in chests back to town and sell at half price if they don't want them.  There is no exchange for money at full value.

Good game. Three only flaws: 
1 - it takes too long to play a dungeon
2 - despite the large number of characters/equipment/skills provided some of them are so weak that are never used, while some other combos are a "must-have", thus limiting the effective variety of of player choices. 
3 - Same as (2) for the Overlord: monsters that are clearly much stronger or weaker than the threat cost of the spawning card suggests.

I'm a huge fan of pen and paper and computer roleplaying games. I knew that Descent isnt anything like that, its just a fun dungeon romp. However for our group of 3 the game was too bland. It took too long to play for what it is, it required a lot of concentration, but it just wasnt fun enough in exchange for our investment. 

I traded my copy for Talisman and Citadella, and now Im a happy little camper, i think ill never look back. Dont get me wrong, im sure that for the right people Descent could be a 9 game, but for me it didnt worth my gaming time.

2/21/06 - Rating pending first play.

3/5/2006 - This is an Excellent game. The battle system is excellent. The extensive play-testing is apparent in the fluid mechanics of the game. Everything is balanced and each time you come across a new part of the game and see the balance in action realization of why it was setup in such a manner hits you with a little smirk. This has everything that makes you interested in D&D and none of the baggage that makes you say that you will NEVER play D&D! The pieces are amazing, the box is the perfect size to pack all the pieces. The only reason this doesn't get a 10 is the fact that it is a Co-op all vs. one game and it lacks some of the strategic components I would like in a PERFECT game. However, it is a SOLID 9!

Personally, I thought the game mechanics were excellent. After playing RPGs like D&D, and games like Runebound and Magic Realm, I appreciate the way Descent tries to simplify the rules to maximise fun. Sure, there was stuff we kept forgetting, but stuff like that becomes second-nature after a few more plays.

The overlord's is a very well done mechanic in an otherwise typical dungeon crawler.  Lots of potential in this one, a little long but nothing unexpected from a dungeon crawler.  There's lots to be had with the game play and characters, and a ton of variety in the scenarios.

A very nice dungeon cralwer. The rules are complex but not too dificult and are easy enough once you get the hang of it. The components are great (of course) and I really like the fact, that the Overlord is *not* an Dungeonmaster (in the sense of RPGs) but a competitive player.
The main drawback is the missing campaign system. Another thing that bothers me a bit, is the long playing time that also is hard to calculate (Depending on the circumstances a certain adventure can vary in lenght significantly). I like long games but this one can draw out too long. I am yet undecided on the balance issue because I have only played the game four times yet. I don´t expect total balance anyway, but to me it seems, that the game is definitly in favour of the heroes (four Heroe victories out of four games).
07/21/07 update: After some more play, the game seems heavily in favour of the overlord in the later quests. Not quite sure, how this can be balanced or if the heroes play badly.
01/01/15 update: Great game - but Imperial Assault is way better! Lowered score from 9 to 7.

My rating on this is based on a comparison with the 2nd edition. On its own: a long dungeon crawl with one player acting against the other players. It can be fun, but there is no campaign just a ton of individual adventures.

VS 2nd edition
This fails against the 2nd edition for a number of reasons. The 2nd edition tightens up the systems a good amount making the game easier to understand and is just more fun. The minis for the 2nd edition are worlds better with much more detail. There are co-op and solo options in 2nd ed. Tiles are more varied in 2nd ed.

So different than Runebound. I tried 1,2 and 3 player game with the 3-player being by far the most interesting.

This game is excellent for introducing elements of D&D (a character passes a spot in the dungeon and she sees a slight discoloration of the wall, "discovering" a hidden room filled with monsters and cool loot.
Starting with vanilla Descent and expaning on this idea it's easy to make this a very engrossing boardgame/D&D hybrid.

The definitive dungeon crawler, with more amazing bits than can be found in Smaug's lair. Near infinite variety with all the treasures, characters, and scenario mixes (not to mention expansions).

The rating for this is only temporarily, expected to shift upwards with advancing quests. I was playing the overlord twice. With the first quest resulting in two parts of the game. The first half of it was the heroes storming the dungeon, wiping away my monsters at single stroke or if not, using one of multiple talents/weapons (maybe there are too many) to do with the monster before a counteratttack. That way they moved through the dungeon, reducing my actions almost to only setting up the rooms and nothing else in a 4-hour time span. Oh yeah, I could play a card from time to time and sometimes even got to finish of their weakest player. Second "half" (maybe 5 minutes) of the game was the heroes opening the Big Boss' room. I played some cards, the giant swept around, kiling two heroes at once, taking away all of the heroes tokens. That was the game. The second quest however was much better balanced, very tense and with every side having its chances for victory, moving back and forth. What more, it turned out to be, that levelling up is much harder than in other fantasy games (say Talisman, Runebound, World of warcraft) That's not bad. Yet, if you do want to actually see your hero progress from wimp to pimp, you might be better off with one of the other games.

My friend played Hero Quest with his older brother as a kid. A few years ago, he got a copy of it off of ebay for $50. I played it for the first time that Christmas. I loved it! Fighting monsters, collecting treasure, and slaying bosses. Epic.......... until I realized that there was a game that was Hero Quest on steroids. That game is Descent. This game is the dungeon crawl to end all dungeon crawls. The game is so immersive. When it's set up, people are drawn to it. Every single person that has played it so far has loved the game. If you have a friend who has even the slightest interest in anything geeky like LOTR or even video games, try this game with them. I read the forums and all the comments on how the game's rules are awful. I studied up on the rules and have yet to have a rules debate. Don't be afraid of the price either, if you have any interest in this game at all, get it. Awesome minis, Beautiful board, great components. This is, by far, my favorite game to date.

Pretty fun game that feels like the adventurers can't possibly win.  Then they get upgrades, loot, and the like and by the end, it feels like the Overlord can't possibly win.
It's just plain fun.
It's a bit complex and takes a while to setup and to play.  For these reasons, I almost never get it to the table.

RATING: 5.75
good quality components. However, there are some problems with the dicing system. Try having every melee attack having only a 1 in 6 chance of failing to hit. Rules are a little disjointed. But there has been a lot of thought &  effort gone into producing this game, which is evidenced by some of the clever solutions thought out by the designers. 
There is also a fundamental problem with characters dying, in the sense that they can come "back" so easily.
UPDATE: Many new ideas and fixes with the expansions but some new issues!

A good, satisfying dungeon crawl, if a bit long. WOuld be aided by campaign rules (which I understand are coming). I keep hearing that the game favors the Heroes/Overlord in about equal amounts... makes me think there must be some balance there.

Dungeon Crawl. Not a bad game, but the mechanics lend the "Overlord" player to continually spawn monsters, even when it is clear the heroes are winning. 1st Edition play time is sadly too long.

First Impression: 
This is my definition of AmeriTRASH. It drags insanely long, you spent 90% of your time rolling dice, your enemies are impossibly endless etc etc
An endless mindless repetition of the exercise in futility.

An epic game preferably played over a weekend rather than a single night. Balance amongst the characters is fine, but it seems to be incredibly hard to achieve the objective on a regular basis. Great if you like the concept of challenging roleplay with your avid gamer friends.

RATING: 5
Nifty big game.  Not my style of game at all(coop elements, length) by a good once in awhile game.  The amount of characters and items create replayability in a sense, I'm just concerned the game may become "decision streamlined", the sense that there is an obvious best decision/choice.  Only one play, so this statement could be completely unfounded.  I think I may need to revisit this with just 2 players, but there are so many games I really enjoy with just 2, it may never happen.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite a fun game.  Runs long but really time FLIES by when playing it.  No down time, the game just moves.  Every player is in it constantly.  Those like me who are old school D&Ders and do not want to go back to RPGing but like the style...this is IT!

RATING: 9
Descent: Journeys in the Dark (with Descent: The Well of Darkness expansion) is one of those huge Fantasy Flight games that I’d also wanted to try for a long time, despite not enjoying Twilight Imperium, I thought Descent might be fun, and it was. I liked how the Overlord (i.e., Dungeon Master) is able to play the game against everyone else so no one needs to sit out to run the game. It works well as a one against many game and while it might run a bit long, it’s a fun romp of a hack-n-slash.

Descent only loses points due to its length; this one takes a long time.  A group of veteran players can hammer through a scenario, but any kind of casual game can definitely last several (ie, more than 4) hours.

The game has great components, characters, monsters, and the rules work well.  The different color dice are great for combat, and present a more understandable mechanic to new players.

The game can be a little frustrating for the DM, as players tend to mow-down your minions with ease, especially once they have a few magic items available.

Overall, a fun game which players really seem to enjoy.

**Please note that the Road to Legend expansion jacks this game up to a 10 for me.***

RATING: 7
I really prefer the second edition, which is heresy in some parts. This game has brilliant design - mechanics, and graphic & tactile presentation - and was iconic. I've cannibalized my first edition for parts for role-playing, as well as importing the monsters into second edition via the conversion pack
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A somewhat enjoyable RPG-like board game. There are some good points on it, like character customization, great artwork, nice bits.

This is, probably, an emotional rating, since my first and only play was bad, not exciting (the Overlord simply trampled us), and even with some good moments, the overall experience was seriosly lacking.

I did play Doom Board Game afterwards, and I liked it fine, and the basics for Descent are all there. But I won't change the rating until I played this edition of Descent, at least one more time (and have a good time with it). However, I don't see this happening anytime soon.

Huge, bit-studded, expensive, long-on-the-table, and yea, a ton of fun. :D 
Revising a few years in: Of course, with the release of newer, faster, simpler games, that deliver more steadily moving fun, without the brutal admin and detail overhead, Descent gets a litte more marginalized. Given a choice between hours and hours of single-game descent, and the ability to play 3-4 games of Castle Ravenloft or Wrath of Ashardalon, CR or WoA are going to see a lot more frequent play time by comparison.

Ameritrash at its best with a lot of balancing work and house rules it can become a fun old school childish heroquest experience to play with friends. Alcohol is required to enjoy though.
Warning. The game as it is is almost unplayable. The heroes are too strong, the evil guy has no chance. More so if the heroes retain their special objects/treasures from previous plays they become unbeatable.
Needs rebalancing

Only played once so far.  We breezed through the first scenario and we're looking forward to playing again.  I don't really understand why so many people complain about the game taking too long to play.  Did they read the 240 minute playing time on the box before they played it?  We finished our game in less then that amount of time, and that included the OL player (and game owner) explaining all the rules to us, and setup time.

The only real downside to this game is that it takes a long time to play (which means it won't hit the table that often) and the victory strategies are not intuitive to new players (meaning the game can sometimes take even longer, as players analyze what to do next.)

That said, the game itself is fantastic, and even the 6+ hour sessions wind up being really fun.

Descent: Journeys in the Dark is a semi-cooperative game in which two to five players will take on the antagonistic roles of heroes and Overlord. Up to four players will choose characters with a wide assortment of skills and innate abilities to be the heroes who will explore dungeons in search of treasure and adventure. One player will take on the role of the Overlord and will control the dungeon's many traps, puzzles, and monsters.

Basically a tactics role playing game. While I like the fantasy theme to the game, this is a dungeon crawl and like most dungeon crawls, the treasure happens to be the most attractive part of the game. Nothing special here. The rules are ok, nothing new to shout about although I find the fatigue system lends itself for some strategy. Will likely play it again with right crowd.

I played Doom and really enjoyed it.  This is much the same thing, except we normally have 5 players, so game fits better in our group.  Its a great game and reminds me of my days playing role playing games, but it isn't nearly as much work.  The game is structured to make the players feel pretty powerful, but that can be a little frustrating as the overlord.  It is not uncommon for monsters to get cut down before they even get a real attack, but despite this, I was still able to keep the players on the edge through most of the first scenario.  About the only real knock on this game is the length.  It is probably the right length for this sort of game, but it still will make it hard to get out again.  We have to organize multiple play sessions in a row to make it work.

The rule book is a pain to look through.  The rules themselves are ok once you know where to find things (I'm still learning).  Your best bet is to grab the consolidated rules here on BGG and reference that.

One thing I haven't liked are the condition of the bits.  The interlocking corridors don't seem to always want to interlock very well.  You have to press and adjust things to get them to stay together.  If this was a puzzle, I would have taken it back to the store if that says anything.  My set contained a Naga that was decapitated, a spider that was broken off of his base, and a skeletal archer missing part of his bow.  The packing for these figures could stand some improvement.  Another, personal pet peeve, is that there are a TON of tokens and counters to keep track of.  Keeping a handle on all of these for a first timer is a bit much.  Finally, one strangeness with the cards is that the blue die appears to be purple.  At first I thought we were missing a die, but it's just shoddy coloring on the printer's part.  This is very annoying.

As far as the game goes, the mechanics are simple and my sons and I enjoy playing it.  I've played this with an 8-year old and an 11-year old.  The 11-year old is really shining with tactical concepts which is fun.  They both are *REALLY* good at remember board set up from the previous plays -- pointing out where all the treasures and potions should go while I'm still referencing the map in the quest book.  The 8-year old tends to ignore his skill cards and we've not been using the order markers -- that's just too much for either of them.  Even so, they do pretty well.

So that makes up for the problems with the bits, I guess.  I bought it on-line for $50.  Had I got it from my LGS (notice the lack of the 'F') at the $80 MSRP, I would have felt ripped off.

I can't say that it's my favorite game, but I can say that it's my favorite game that I rate as a 6.  

On the one hand, I can't rate it any higher because playing it is a half day marathon largely dominated by a copious amount of downtime.  On the other hand, the fantastic realization of the always popular dungeon-crawler theme and 4 vs 1 semi-cooperative dynamic make it a nice way to spend a Sunday with a small group of friends. 

So, take it or leave it for what it is: a great big mess of a game that one can use to scratch that just-gotta-smash-some-monsters itch that you (you know who you are) get from time to time.

I keep looking for a better (readily available) dungeon crawler.  This and D&D 4E seem to be the best. 

There are quite a few (significant understatement here) plays of this that I did not log. 

Neither this nor D&D 4E got the support I felt they merited. 

In my opinion Descent 2E is an overall worse game, with 2 significant improvements over 1E, but so many other disadvantages, that I still prefer 1E by quite a bit.

Fantastic fun. The balance from flip from the heroes to the overlord in a turn, so the heroes can't get comfortable unless the overlord is out of cards and threat.

Although the games are long (4-5  hours), it doesn't seem like it. It's a good way to get a quick RPG fix without all that pesky roleplaying getting in the way of dicefesthacknslash combat. You get a ridiculous amount of stuff in the ridiculously huge box.

Lots to like about this dungeon crawl. It has minis, lots of creatures and lots of dice. Downsides: It takes a long time to set up and break down. It has an all-against-one setup that may not appeal to every group. It's got the usual Fantasy Flight issue of having one or two too many rules to fiddle with. Because of these issues, I prefer Castle Ravenloft.

Always a fun time and the after the game discussions are always interesting.  Would be rated higher but some people that play characters do not enjoy it as much as the 2nd version.  I have only played as the Overlord.

Playing as a character moves this to a 7.

RATING: 5
It's a lot of fun to cooperate against a common enemy, but this game is too long for the amount of fun I get from it.  This seems like a game that I would love if it was one of 10 in my collection, and I gave it frequent play.  With my options at 100+, I don't play it enough to really familiarize myself with it.  All three of my plays have been bogged down as we constantly check the rulebook.  The pace feels like it needs to be about four times as fast.  I don't like that the only real method of character growth is through treasure.  I like the dice system, but not enough to actually slog through the dungeon.

Somehow, I still prefer Doom. There's a lack of tension in Descent that makes it less nerve-wracking and exciting. And it does become a bit of a long slog. Perhaps I need to play more often.

RATING: 3
Ugh. I don't like dungeon crawls and it was because of this that this game did not settle well with me. Only 1 play and it took 3 hours for the 1st scenario. It is a good game in that it seems that the overlord is playing a different game from the one that you are playing. If you are playing with others who are into the theme then it would be a fun game but if you don't like fancy name such as "Theodrun the Battlescarred" or somesuch, I suggest you stay away.

As for the dolls, there are plenty of them in the box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good dungeon crawl type game.  If I was more inclined to the fantasy theme then I'd up my rating to an 8, because it was a fun game and time passed quickly.  I like the fact that the overlord is trying to eliminate the players, unlike the Dungeon Master in the advanced D&D games that I played in the 80's where you were just the story teller.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It takes quite some time, both to setup and play, but it is a really fun game, it can be really rewarding to play as the overlord and the feeling of happiness that comes with successfully killing off a hero is incredible. This game should not be played with whiners of any kind as they can really make you in a bad mood

RATING: N/A
[Played 48 times]
The core rules (mostly taken from "Doom") are decent, but would have needed a better development and much more playtesting (e.g. costs of the cards, Golden Items, etc.).
The scenarios are not very engaging (unbalanced and lacking any sort of flavour).

Being used to the GW titles (HQ, AHQ and especially WHQ), it lacks more variety of enemies, a "campaign mode" and a "random dungeon generator" (you'll need to design your scenarios, investing time and hoping to make them well).
I also miss a "magic system" worthy of this name (magic is just a different kind of ranged attack; it's as if the only known spell is "Magic Missile"... and ANY character may cast it! Despite the name, they're fireweapons, not magic).
There is a lot of randomness, but also tactical choices.

It has a more "German" approach to the dungeon crawling genre than the GW titles (e.g. optimization, resource management, simple story arc, extremely abstract town, etc.).
It also lacks much of the "dungeon crawling" feeling: you're a commando trying to rush in, grab the goodies and kill the enemies before they can react and crush you; it doesn't feel like exploring, discovering, alternating battles and lulls, etc.

Long.
It'd need too much work even to house rule it into a decent game.
Disappointing.

Can be long and there is a lot of luck due to the amount of dice rolling, but currently one of the best dungeon crawls in my opinion.  Very different characters and monsters, lots of treasure, and one of my favorite things-a modular game board.  High replay value.  Plus you get a lot for your money.  FFG usual high quality product.

RATING: 8
A modern and improved Hero Quest, probably its successor. 

Could be rated even higher but the game is very umbalanced and the difficulty depends on number of players too much (basically it's too easy with 3+ heroes, and too difficult with 2 heroes). I recommended to use some House Rules here or there for balance. 

Too long to play (some hours) but if you have no problem with that, it's a fun game.

Complejo para montar un simple escenario, enorme, es llamativo pero para mi gusto le falta la profundidad que se consigue con alguna de las expansiones.

Creo que consigue su objetivo, pero por el precio que tiene y la cantidad y precio de sus innumerables expansiones realmente ofrece menos de lo que debería.

Descent is a great tactical combat game for two or more people. It's not a dungeon crawl or an RPG.

As a tactical combat game, I prefer it to Earth Reborn. It's quicker to set up and easier to learn the rules.

To me games in this genre would be (and are) better implemented as video games.

Exciting, gorgeous, thematic, and sporting several interesting mechanics that allow for a highly tactical dungeon crawl, Descent is the best D&D-type board game I have ever played. It's marred by several issues regarding difficulty and balance (very often quests come across as either too difficult or too easy), as well as its long playing time - this game can really, really drag. I rarely get to play Descent because of this.

Across the land, courageous heroes delve into shadowed dungeons, journey to lost cities, and explore forgotten ruins. In the darkest corners of the world, these heroes confront deadly and terrifying monster, including Skeletons, Hell Hounds, Giants, Demons, and Dragons. For those few who survive, the rewards are many. Victorious heroes return from the treacherous dungeons with ancient magics, bags of gold, and powerful weapons and artifacts.
\13\\13\
In Descent: Journeys in the Dark, you play on of these daring adventurers. Armed with mighty weapons and powerful abilities, you venture into the dungeon to battle monsters, escape deadly traps, discover lost treasures, and ultimately, confront and defeat the evil masters that dwell in the hidden place. Can you survive the dark?

RATING: 6
This game is something the fantasy genre has needed for a long time. A dungeon delve that focuses on combat, with a Dungeon Master who doesn't have to be bored "challenging" players but not really hurting them. In Descent, the DM is not your friend...He wants to kill your character and laugh while doing it.

The game is a lot of fun and does a nice job of managing the two sides of the conflict. My only real complaint about it is that the monsters the Overlord (DM) gets to spawn are incredibly easy to kill. There isn't nearly as much tactical maneuvering as I expected, because most of the critters go down in one shot. The best use of your monsters is usually to charge straight ahead and try to overwhelm the heroes with sheer numbers.

Occasionally a monster does spawn with an opportunity to do something creative, but those moments are few and far between. I know the designers wanted to keep things simple and clean, but I think in this case it ended with a missed opportunity. The heroes also power up exceptionally fast, which adds to the problem. By the middle of the game the Overlord is usually reduced to playing trap cards on the team's weakest member to try and score kills. It's still fun, just not nearly as satisfying as it could be.

It's a cool idea for a game and it comes with buckets of plastic miniatures. You could do a whole lot worse than Descent to get your fantasy gaming fix.

I'd forgotten how annoying painting is, but it adds so much to this kind of game...ugh.

As a game, kind of dull, and certainly too long, with fewer real choices (less angst) than I'd hoped given the pedigree (and reading Moon's review in the Hobby Games book). Less variety of interesting items, too, and, just as with Doom, even really weak items can suddenly be powerful (a dagger takes out an Ogre!?  WTF?). But fun with the kids, which is why I got it.

This is a solid "dungeon crawl" style adventure game.  It seems to be most enjoyable when played with 3 or 4 heroes and the Overlord player needs to have a strong grasp of the adventure and rules to make everything work properly.   All in all a fun game which won't be for everybody, but will really appeal to some people.

The concepts in this game are really neat, being able to construct dungeons and play through them.  I have two main beefs with the game though, first it seemed like with our group that either the overload did ownage, or the heros did, that's to say that most games swung one way or the other pretty quickly.  Second, in many situations the starting gear for an archer type isn't very good, in the sense that you eithe rcan hit, and do no damage, or hit and do damage but be very vulnerable.  Other than that this one's pretty fun that doesn't get played as often as I think it deserves in our group.

This is an excellent game to use to determine if your children (or other children) are ready to try their hand at role-playing games yet. Strong teamwork emphasis, but make sure that the dungeon master gets enough time to set everything up (i.e. if he's spending all his time trying to teach other people how to play the game, he'll forget to do certain things) so that you don't miss out on anything.

HISTORY: I first came across this game in 2006 when I played it at a friend's place. Back then it struck me as hopelessly complex. In the years since I took to D&D 3rd and 4th edition (after a long RPG hiatus from my childhood), and got used to more complex games. When revisiting Descent in 2009, the game struck me as fairly easy to digest and grok, if also largely pedestrian. This is D&D's younger brother in most regards, for better or ill. 

Now that it's 2012, with a second edition on the horizon, I grabbed two cheap copies of the first edition, one for myself, one for my nephews. It's really my experiences of the game with them that account for how I view and rate the game today. See recorded plays, especially no. 1.

RATING: In a nutshell, great components, especially the dice and the adorable minis. The rules the game comes with are at best functional and miss all that matters in D&D (perception and parley rolls, among others). With due adjustments it's fairly easy to create memorable gaming experiences with this. But out of the box, I rate this a 5/10, and frankly that's generous.

I have played this game at least 10 times and have only seen a game finished once.  This game is a perfect example of what a role playing game looks like as a board game (I am referring to the phenomenon where many role players spend more time reading the source books and thinking about the game than actually playing it.)

RATING: 6
A generally (though not completely) improved version of Doom, although the game loses points for being so darn long.  Due to time constraints, I can't imagine playing Descent more than 10 times in my life.

Update:

I hit the 10-play mark!  My kids like the game, and it hits the table occasionally at cons and game nights.  I may actually hit 20 plays before death.  So sue me.

For those hoping to improve balance issues, we always use the following variants: (1) threat costs on spawn cards are [i]per figure[/i], with the overlord having the option to spawn fewer than the maximum # of figures - although any master figures are always spawned last, and (2) killing the same hero twice in a row results in the overlord receiving half the number of conquest tokens, rounded down.

This is an amazing game. I have played both as the DM and as a player and it is just a gas. Last night we played for 5 and a half hours until after midnight and we would have completed the scenario
if didn't have so much stuff to do today. For a pretty time consuming game, it holds your interest and is full of surprises. Even my wife is hooked on it. It seems we won't be playing too many other games for a while.

Haven't played with the expansions, so just judging the base game. Extensive setup time, horribly imbalanced items, and mechanics (random spawns) that just make no sense in a fantasy setting. I know I'm in the minority but I consider Doom to be WAY better. Doom is a *game*, Descent is... something else.

My son and his friends enjoy this when I run the game. My friends are lukewarm at best, not the theme because we play plenty of other fantasy games. Combat doesn't feel quite right.

RATING: 6.5
Finally got a play of this which lasted for about 4 hours until we ran out of time. As the heroes, we didn't stand much of a chance with two rooms left and only 3 CT to spare, so it didn't feel too bad to end early. When playing, I couldn't tell 4 hours had already gone by.

Really enjoyed it, wished there was a way to get more plays but 5-6 hour sessions aren't going to come along often. I'd honestly play it any time I had the opportunity though, and that's saying something.

Sold. Would never get the plays to warrant keeping it.

RATING: 9
Adjusted my rating up a point after my second run as GM. I like the ease of setup and the less randomness of the dungeon layout over Advanced HeroQuest. The bits are neat, the dice are far more visually appealing the the lone D12 in AHQ.

This game is fun! I primarily play as the OL, and it scratches the same itch that other games like HQ and AHQ do, but with far more ease of play.

It is quicker to set up then Advanced HeroQuest and faster to play. New players can easily pick up the system and can integrate well into the game.

RATING: 7
1e is just WAY too long an involved. It's a fun game with pretty bits, but gets very repetitive.  Too many ways for the hero to succeed, means the OL player likely gets beaten.  NOT like Doom, where it is the other way around.  Decent dungeon crawl, though.  Check out 2e for more streamlined play, or stay with 1e if a full-blown, intricate and involved game is your thing.

I'm so glad I got this game. Fantastic dungeon crawl experience. It does seem that the object is to rush through to the final boss though, before the Overlord spawns an entire army on top of the heroes.

I think Frank would love this game. It involves great dolls, and has loads of dice. It even has character advancement if played with 'Road to Legend.'

I think it's pretty bad. Mostly, I think, due to the huge amount of dice use.

a lot of fun.  the best dungeon crawl game i've played.  it really seems streamlined, compared to Hero Quest, or even Runebound.  the variety of scenarios is exceptional, and with the availability of multiple expansions, i find this game to be outstanding.  overlord and player alike can have fun with this game.

ME FLIPA, pero la duración y espacio hace que no vea mesa toooodo lo que se merece, pero es una joya (y yo no soy muy plastiquero).

Desgraciadamente, lo vendí aún gustándome mucho ya que lo que de verdad transforma este juego en una grandísima experiencia lúdica es el modo campaña y eso amigos, es tranquilamente 25 partidas de 8 horas, en mi caso... completamente inviable.

(Rated based on non-expansion materials)

Great mechanics, I see a lot of potential inside of this game. Scenarios are quite difficult, however. Makes me feel bad as an overlord most of the time. Some things are not dealt with very well that breaks the system a little bit, but these are identifiable and very easily rectified.

A fine dungeoncrawl! This is certainly the one to get until/unless Advanced Heroquest gets a reprint. My only wish is that I could find a way to lop an hour or two off the playtime.

***WELL, it IS a good dungeoncrawl but, after a few plays, it is TOO long and tedious for my tastes. The Road to Legend campaign we played killed this one for me. As a one-shot game, it's too long. As a campaign, deadly dull.

Описание: Покорение подземелья одного игрока командой приключенцев других игроков
Суть: разведка подземелья, убийство толп монстров, призыв толп монстров, сбор экипировки, броски кучи кобиков.
Сложность: средняя, объясняется за 30 минут.
Игроков: 2-5, один из них играет против всех остальных. Лучше 4-5.
Тип: тактика 50%, удача 30%, стратегия 20%
Длительность: 1-4 часа
Оформление: очень хорошее.

Великолепная игра. Поначалу. Но потом она мне очень сильно надоела и разонравилась. Не все от нее так быстро устают, и я часто даю игру поиграть кому-нибудь еще, чтобы не просили меня в нее играть. Интересна сама идея игры: устроить противостояние мастера подземелья и героев по строгим правилам (а не как в D&D - на волю DMа). Чем больше подземелье, тем игра затянутей, в гигантские играть совершенно невозможно.

[b]HUGELY DISAPPOINTING.[/b]

Descent is an overblown, overrated dungeon-crawler with more bells and whistles than a bell&whistle market.
I really wanted to like this game - really I did!

However, other games blow this out of the water. Rather than playing like a simplified D&D adventure, this game plays like a Serious Sam PC shoot-em-up: the creatures are like balloons with hammers, and they're bloody endless!

This game is just pure fun.  I'm a complete sucker for fantasy games and this is actually my first pure dungeon crawl.  I really enjoy being both the Overlord and the heroes.  Both sides are so unique that it feels like two games in one.

The game is normally a bit long (Unless the OL gets an early victory), and there are a lot of little rules here and there to keep track of.  However the game is just thrilling and I'm glad I finally decided to pick it up.

RATING: 7
If you have the time and the money to invest, I am pretty sure Descent is the dungeon crawler game to get.  The painted miniatures, the 3D map boards and all the other accessories really do add to the experience.  Unfortunately, it also means extra time for setup and tear down as you recreate each floors.  The whole process isn't as bad if you have a capable DM running the show with people that can make decisions without too much AP, but even then there is plenty of downtime, and I cannot imagine playing this with newcomers that aren't able to grasp the concepts very quickly.

I enjoy the different type of dice and how they represent range, damage and whether special abilities can trigger.  The line of sight rule is a bit perplexing to me, but I usually leave it to the other people to determine.  Descent is a great game to pull out once in a while when you crave a bit of mayhem and battles.

It's an "8" right now with the potential to climb higher.  I really enjoyed my first playing of Descent.  Even with rules explanation and a bunch of looking stuff up, my wife and I got through the first quest in 3 hours.  Customizability out the yin-yang.  First Runebound, now Descent.  What am I turning into? ;)

My favorite game to play. It takes a whole day and a group of seasoned gamers, but there's a lot of magic in the teamwork and tactics involved. I absolutely despise being the Overlord, however, because it often seems like there's no chance for him to win. If a player can still enjoy the game without feeling the need to win, however, everyone can have a great time that few other games can provide.

I still prefer the first edition to the second edition.  The main thing I like is that the scenarios are much more epic than a skirmish or two and there is more character progression during a scenario.  I also think the extra complexity adds to the richness of the play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is one of my absolute favorite games ever!  It is truly complex and offers some pretty intense game sessions.  Although many people consider this to be a rip off of other games, I think every game is guilty of that in some way or another in terms of mechanics.  I, on the other hand, disagree with the statement.

The production value of this is amazing!  Having an insane amount of miniatures included really takes this over the top!  I cannot praise this game enough!

The game play is excellent as either a hero or the overlord.  Both sides of the spectrum are fanastic and very well balanced, in my opinion.  If you do, however, encounter some issues of balance, the expansions do a very good job ironing it out.

The components are perfect in every sense of the word. As mentioned, the miniatures included are very detailed and high quality.  The artwork which adorns everything included in the box is stunning and highly thematic.  I am very pleased.

This has to be my favorite Fantasy Flight game to date!

Fun for the players (so I'm told) but too much work for the game master, IMO. Spent too much game time trying to track what cards to play and when I could play them (while trying to remember what ones I even had in my hand). For a dungeon crawler, I get more mileage (fun-wise) out of Warhammer Quest.

I am a sucker for dungeon-type games. It requires a game master to steer the monsters, which means someone (= me) has to "do the hard work". Main drawback is that it's a bit too high-paced. Monsters and monsters and new weapons and gear and money and and and. A bit like tiring from too many Christmas presents. Halfway through a scenario I'm fed up. Also a bit too centered around combat, no other spells than "fireball" spells.

A lot of cool staff in the box. When i bought it, I was looking for an easy and fast dungeon-crawling boardgame... and I'm still looking for it :D

This game is a huge time vacum that just leaves me drained.  It's funny, because I don't mind long, epic games, but in Descent, it takes hours and hours to make the tiniest bit of progress.  It's not epic at all, it's just a inefficient game system that demands a lot and returns little.  There are millions of games out there that accomplish way more with much less.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great fantasy tactical game. You need a cooperative group since the rules are somewhat ambiguous. If you can chase away the rules lawyers, it becomes a lot more fun.

The components can double as dungeon tiles for D&D.

I recently bought my own copy. Set-up can take a bit, so it's best to be prepared in advance. Like with Twilight Imperium, this is a game that it's best to schedule an evening around.

A very good fantasy version of Doom, which I initially felt was better than its predecessor - and its true, they have polished and tightened a lot of the rules.  However, there are a few balance issues which  badly need to be fixed.  Halfway through a dungeon, after a coupla bronze or silver chests, the heroes are SO hard nothing is even vaguely a challenge.  However, the minis are ace, it looks brilliant, and is fun to play.  Games are a touch on the long side sadly, takes around 3 hours per dungeon.

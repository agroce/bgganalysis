RATING: 9.5
Wonderful design. Careful planning required although it can end up being a bit multi-player solitaire. To avoid this, play on a tight board where you ignore opponents at your peril. Just slightly too long to be able to play too often but well worth the effort.

I've played it with 1-4 players, and prefer it either solo. I have trouble seeing where I'd want to play it with 5 or 6 people (let alone 4), especially if it's not an isolationist map... This is a game that reminds me of Ora & Labora/Le Havre with the resource conversion chain (but expanded), and a spatial component bolted on that is abstracted in the former two titles (totally in Le Havre and partially on O&L). The more I play though, the more I find that it reminds me of Twilight Struggle in terms of sharp edges in the rules as written. Numerous times I have had to go hunting through forums or posted FAQs to find something that was insufficiently defined or explained in the rulebook. Some of this is just the price of learning a game, but some of it is just hard edges/corner intersections of rules.

Splotter is renowned for being fiddly and this is no exception; chits, markers, little pieces being moved and stood up/laid down. Wargamer tweezers would help in this area, but otherwise it hovers around "almost too much." The turn order "praying" situation is prototypical Splotter; why accomplish with one track what you can with two and an additional paragraph of rules (similar to hull value/player tracks in Indonesia; unnecessary and valueless).

It's enjoyable; I like resource conversion chains and spatial games, but there are two serious downsides; maps are solvable in the abstract, and the game has an epic passive/aggressive feeling to it w/ the stealing of resources. On the flip side, the sandbox you get to play in, and things you can pull off (especially with the expansion) are staggering when combined with the various map options. Last, in the multi-player game, it runs about an hour too long on the assumption that someone doesn't make a serious attempt at the wonder. The solo game doesn't have that problem as much since it's just 20 turns. On the note of the wonder, the idea of game pacing and game clock is really strong (but subtle) here; if I throw a bunch of stuff into the wonder, you may not have sufficient turns to really get your stuff moving and score points. It's similar to the various strategies in FCM; do you go for the short game and hope you can end it before your strategy peters out, or do you go for the long game and hope the game doesn't end before you can get any semblance of points on the board. Even in a 2p game, it's quite possible (but no small task) to win by running out the clock (I've done so, but only barely). Much like the rest of the game, it is simultaneously wonderful and infuriating.

I do sort of just sit and think about it sometimes... Not every game can say that, so I guess that's something. Rated a 7 for solo play, a 6 for 2p, a 4 for +3p (for a simultaneous action game, it drags too long, *especially* if you constantly call for turn order).

From 1 Review: This game looks like a lot of fun, but the price is incredibly high and the game is long. Granted with 2 or 3 other people who would enjoy this game on regular basis then I would buy this game and play it, however I have a feeling it would collect a lot of dust in between plays right now.

A wonderfully immersive puzzle, would really love to play this with a group who knew it well or wanted to play it a few times to get to know it. I played it a lot solo so I got better at optimizing making points, which is hard to grasp just by looking at it so it's recommended for a warm up. 

I'd like to explore how the player interaction can build on that experience with assymetrical starts and having close quarters to encourage co-opetition.

Grain of salt time.

Random and rambling thoughts: I am not sure what to think of this game. It's clearly very clever, could even be very good with intense and interactive players as there is room for blocking and stealing goods.

But, I simply don't like creating logistical chains, if that is even the right combination of words to use. It didn't excite me to build things that then went on to produce things and create a hub and spoke system (or some other system) to carry other things along in an efficient manner.

It feels like a game that a coder might love. I can see someone who writes long lines of code that need to create an end product that is efficient and clean might like this game. But for me, it was meh. I am not a coder btw.

I liked that you needed to draw in the transport system but I felt like I was whiteboarding a proposal at work and took me out of the game.

The whole thing just felt like work.

Roads & Boats has a vast playground of board gaming space. I've only played once so I'm still not 100% sure how to manage it all very well. Unfortunately, like the other Splotter games I've tried, I like the beginning more than I like the end. It gets a bit fuzzy and bogged down with calculation overhead towards the latter half. But the basic mechanics are just 'neat' and very interesting to play around with. Lots of cool map variability too.

Un par de partidas no registradas.

Uno de los juegos más sobrevalorados que conozco, pero en general como todos los de esta editorial.
Acabado amateur (juegos sin retractilar, componentes reguleros, reglas con lagunas, etc...) y precio profesional.
El juego no tiene casi interacción entre jugadores y se trata de de un solitario de optimización logística. Pero vamos, sin gracia ni diversión ninguna. En momentos de la partida ya es muy obvio quien va a ganar, pero aún queda mucho tiempo para terminarla...

It's very long, it can turn into multiplayer solitaire, and it might not be all that deep, but I can't help but have fun when playing this game.  It's probably that I just really enjoy the kind of optimization involved, and since that's basically the whole game, I tend to like playing it.

Tentative rating based upon one play.  Wow, over 2,000 pieces.  This is definitely a niche game and will be too fiddly for many.  The nice thing about this game is that you can easily play it solitaire.  The down side of this is that experience or 'game hours logged' count for a lot and  when playing against someone with a different experience level that can take some of the fun out of it.  However I am looking forward to more plays of this.  I am going to guess that this plays best with 2.  With more players down time can become a factor.

Feels like it needs a tad more as far as different victory conditions, but house rules can fix that. A civilization is more than just stocks and gold. Lots of chits too, which i love (over 1200). Easy rules.

Played twice -- Not a bad game, but too long. Depending on the setup, the game is optimization and then one telling cut. The cutter gets a jump on everyone, and the victim falls way behind. Then the game keeps going for another hour or two. 

Also makes it difficult/impossible to play with new players.

Possibly the best complex solo game IMHO. Also historically important in the worker placement genre. The bits are small, their manipulation constant. Thus R&B is more easily played by using tweezers. The constant need for important decisions makes this a great and unique game. &cetera adds more depth and fun.

Solo variant is free of late game destructive luck.

What an amazing experience! We played a 3 player game on one of the pre-created maps in the scenario book. Game went about 5 and a half hours. Fantastic puzzle like system. I love the freeform nature of this game. You can build so many different things as well as working on divergent strategies to win. 1 of the players went for as many goods as possible to build wonder quickly. I went for stock certificates (I was able to get 2 by end of game). Another player went for researching mines and getting as much gold as possible. Components are OK, but functional. That would be the only reason this doesn't get a 10 from me. A true masterpiece of game design.

REALLY enjoyed my first game of this massive undertaking. I played with the owner of the game and a regular playing buddy of his, this was my first game so we spent a bit of time in the set up and teach it to me phase, but once it was underway it flowed smoothly and even though there are a multitude of things to do in this game, it was all logical (mostly) and turned out to be worth the time spent on it. Its scarcity and high price may bar my entry to owning it, but will not diminish my looking forward to playing it at least once a year at TN Game days!

I would make this an eight, but as I do not have a copy I am going to hold off until now, this however was one of my "impression" games of the Con, as in it left a favorable one on me. Most all that I played did as I enjoyed them all immensely, however, there are a few standouts in the standouts, and I will not soon forget this one. also it should be noted that the set up went on while I finished a game of Small World, so I was not present for that portion, so it cannot unduly affect me in this way, I sat down, got taught and got to it, a good time!

Four playings, with 2, 3 (twice), and 4 players.  A fun, fiddly (as in constant moving about of the bits) engine game.  Seems to scale well with an appropriate increase in playing time based on the number of players, at least in the scenarios we have played.  Despite being an engine game there seems to be a good bit of leader-changing at various points during the game.  Begging to be computerized.  Feels like there is a magic formula driving the whole thing at times, but I have yet to unlock it.

There is very little i like about this game. Most importantly it's too fiddly for me and it feels like multiplayer solitaire. After the game I had no idea what any of the other players had done or why they did worse or better than me. May try a variant with a lot more interaction but priority is low as the game is also too long in my opinion.

I love this game.  I've only played it 2 player with my wife.  We play moderately friendly--we will steal each others goods and build an occasional wall, but don't actively try and sabotage the others plans.

Once you get the flow down, turns go quickly, and you can watch your plan develop at a steady pace.  The end-game comes quicker than you think.

The big thing keeping this game from a 10 for me is the components.  I don't mind chits, but 1-sided is a pretty big pain.  And, my copy is printed as off-center as you can get and still keep the image from being cut-off.  The artwork leaves a little to be desired as well.

The logistics are cool, and interesting. But, when you play it multiplayer, and every so often just look up and ask if the other players are done, it kinda loses its "gameness" to me. Plus, I have a tough time with games where its hard to remember whether a piece has used its full allotment of moves for a turn. Playing solo, just for a certain score, it just becomes a very expensive puzzle.

The ultimate engine building resource conversion game.  What's interesting about this is despite being one of the deepest games I've ever played, it can be taught in about 10 minutes.

Heavy.

Expansion: &Cetera.

Has interesting elements (choosing between getting early points on the wonder track and the spatial element of your buildings), but the core gameplay of moving around your donkeys and chits are completely unengaging and what you spend most of the game doing. Also, way too low interaction for me, even on a congested map.

Even with design elements I like in concept, this is the most bored I've been playing a game ever, right next to Zombicide. Not a fan of Scythe, but would rather play that for a spatial puzzle game.

Would not play this again.

This is a lovely game, with so much stuff to do!  It's Settlers and Civilization and Ticket To Ride all in one box!  However, it's also a brain-busting exercise in logistics and resource management.  Perhaps a bit too much so for me; players really have to know what they're doing and plan ahead because, if they don't, they'll quickly lag behind.  That drops a possible perfect [10] down to an [8] for me.

Brilliant in its simplicity, from the standpoint of pure design, this (and Arkwright) top my list.  The game is not for the lazy, those players looking to make a few fairly scripted decisions that will determine whether their meeples created the finest farm (or castle, or district, or whatever) in all the land. 

The designers achieved this first by avoiding the hodgepodge of tactical decisions.  Rather, a player's performance in a given session will turn on a few strategic decisions - "I should have built the Coal Burner in turn three."  Yet, because the tech trees are quite simple, a newbie will understand the mechanics within the first few turns.

Lastly, the designers had the courage to avoid artifices that are common in the euro genre.  First, player interaction is finely balanced.  With 4-6 players, this is no multi-player solitaire.  Each player will measure the others for the kinds of threat and opportunities they pose.  "Is she going after my mine?"  Can I get to his Papermill?"

Neither, however, is the game prone to cheap and wanton destruction.  No one will play on you the one-in-the-deck card that destroys what you have built.  Thus, kingmaking has not been an issue.

The theme is cheeky, admittedly.  But even there, the designers did not take themselves too seriously.

Evidence of the greatness of this title is the distraction to which I have seen it drive gamers.  I have played no other title that has resulted in the exhibitions of frustrations seen here.

I believe that this arises from the fact that, based on the set-up and first few rounds, players feel like they're in multi-player solitaire.  When the interaction arises, then, they are surprised..  Accordingly, in order to experience its fullest realization, the game demands stalwart gamers, who can handle interaction and negotiation.

Incredibly fiddly game, but I recall enjoying it while playing it.  Would certainly like to try it again.  The roads are good.  So are the boats.

Roads and Boats would be hands-down kick ass were it not for two things: the dearth of pre-made maps and the narrow victory conditions.  I know, I know, I can make my own maps, or just lay down the tiles and play, but damn it, the 'geek sold it to me as a game system, and 4 measly maps (6 or 8 if you use the ones online) ain't much.  Too many maps made by other users are too damn big!  I've tried a few two player maps that didn't fit under the piece of plastic that comes with the game - way too big, no competition at all.  Worse, though, is the fact that for all the seeming choice the game offers, it really boils down to a race for those damn stock certificates.  A few more paths to victory would have been nice.  Until I plunk down $75 to order & cetera from Splotter central (and believe me, I've thought hard on it) this game won't get played as much as it should, given the price.  Ohhh, evil Splotter!   

*UPDATE* So, I managed to snag & cetera from JKLM Games in the UK. We've only played once with the expansion, and it did give the game spice - art is a viable supplemental strategy, so there are conceivably more paths to victory now, but it wasn't the deciding factor.  All the other additions are quite interesting, but my favorite is the inclusion of new maps, many of which only use certain of the new game elements.  I can't say if it'll transform the base game into something we play more, it is fairly long, but I'd say that, unless you are playing on a very small map with a lot of competition, you should consider the expansion a must-have.

Wow, I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did. After years of hearing how heavy and complex this game was, I was pleasantly surprised to find this much more accessible and intuitive than its reputation suggests.

It's an almost perfect sandbox game: your decision spaces are totally open, which I find so fun and refreshing, even while the consequences of your decisions can be profound (and devastating if you don't think your turns through carefully). It feels like you can do anything during your turn, going any direction, specializing in anything you want. Of course, some moves are far more optimal than others, but the effect is almost one of a simulation more than a competitive game. It's just plain fun moving your stuff around, trying to puzzle out a good move. 

The board and bits are beautiful, and it's so satisfying to see what you've built by the end of the game. The fiddliness does present somewhat of a problem, particularly if you want to take back a move. I have seriously considered taking a picture of the board state before each turn just so players can undo moves if they needed to. This would make an amazing iOS app!

Another Splotter game with lots of little counters and tedious upkeep.  It is an interesting exercise to see if you can expand your network better than your competitors (and use their resources).  I appreciate the mental stimulation, but it isn't "fun" for me at all.  Way too fiddly with many opportunities to forget to move something or make other mistakes.  Would be interesting as a computer game where the CPU can keep track of all the minutia for you, but as a board game it just doesn't grab me and definitely does not hold my interest for the 4-5 hours required.

A fascinating game with an excellent concept and design, but lacking a "second idea" to make it really interesting. As it is, it's more of a puzzle than a game and it progresses too slowly. Also not a dynamic enough environment - it really feels like it just plods along. Worth a play, like most of these small-press games needs more development to be really good - a game that just misses being truly great, but by falling short becomes just a bit better than average. Really should not be played with more than 3, as the pace goes from slow to glacial. Also, best played as "multi-player solitaire"; adding player interaction (through tighter maps with conflict flash-points) slows the game down a *lot* and makes for some high-stakes and potentially quite frustrating conflicts.

Played one game about 2/3 through, and I'd never want to do it again.  While the logistical exercises are cool, the amount of work and fiddling required to do everything is just over the top.  The game starts out very pleasantly, but once we were deep into the game, there were just way too many chits and pieces to keep track of, and I always felt like I was unsure of whether what I was doing was always legal or not due to the sheer amount of stuff and the rules regarding them (I'm not a multitasker, and you definitely need to be one in this game since there are about a bajillion things going on at the same time).

For example, you might be managing several types of transport, where can each move so many spaces and carry so many goods.  There are times you might have a dozen such transport vehicles at your disposal, and you must remember how far each has moved throughout your turn.  I'm simply not capable of remembering where everything was at the start of my turn when dealing with this many variables, and how much movement each of those things has remaining once I get to the middle of my turn.  It's simply too much for me to track without the aid of a computer, making the game unplayable for me.  Trying to track this stuff was extremely unenjoyable.  I suspect I would really love this game if I could play it on a computer where all of this is tracked for me.

Overall, while I really enjoy and admire the idea of the game, it was a fairly painful exercise and definitely not my cup of tea.

RATING: 8
This is an odd game. The lack of ownership of resources makes interaction a scary proposition, which is something that, if done, is done intentionally.

Without interaction, the game, for me, has no merit as there is no randomness and so it's a straight efficiency exercise.

A problem similar to the one I had with Antiquity.

Now I'm wondering, is it normal to not bump into each other? Or is that a learning game problem?

RATING: 6
I'm sort of torn. It's deliciously thinky in way that I sort of enjoyed, and I actually had fun with managing the logistics for the first couple of hours, but R&B is just way, way, way too long for how repetitive and dry it is. I might consider playing again with 2 or 3, but not with four. If I have five or six hours to devote to a single game, I want something with theme and depth, not a static VP-builder. 

If I were rating strictly on my desire to play again, this one might be closer to a four, especially with four players. As a two player game I'd definitely give it another shot. I'm giving it a six because I admire the mechanics and theming. 

Simply put, I admire the game, and acknowledge the skillful play required, but it is pretty much zero fun, especially after the second hour. Boring. It gets a bonus point or two for having a theme that matches the mechanics and has the right "feel" for a logistics game.

I had put off playing this game. I'm phobic about new, dense, rules-heavy games, generally preferring to play something familiar. I had also heard whispers of things that are potential turnoffs such as "it's very long," "you can get eliminated in the first few rounds if you're not careful," etc.

But having played it, I enjoyed it more than I expected. There's a good chunk of rules, but very little bloat. The game scales up, so during your first play, you can wrestle with the increasing complexity as it is presented to you. And at the end of the day, it's a pretty unique puzzle. On the one hand, I described it as something like Through the Ages or Ora et Labora with a special pickup and deliver map on top of it. But upon reflection, it's the first game that made me feel like I was playing a real time strategy computer game... just without the combat.

It made my head hurt, but I enjoyed the challenge. It's certainly not a game I need to own, but I can be talked into playing it again.

Oooff.  Fairly decent brain burner, runs long, but intensely involving and very interactive, both in terms of implicit board positions and explicit negotiation.

RATING: 10
Finally played this one and I love it!  I agree with the comment that it's fiddly (it has LOTS of components) but very much disagree with the comments on too much downtime.  Turns usually are all done simultaneously and I found the downtime to be fairly low (though never played with 4 ).  It's definitely an epic game, but there is so much variety that it makes it more of a gaming toolkit than a singular game.  Quite frankly, if I see another lame "filler" or "beer & pretzel" game I'm going to be ill.  Sometimes I'm in the mood for something evolving, deep, and intricate.  In conclusion, this game does not make me ill.  

UPDATE: Given the nature of this game, it doesn't come out often, but every time it does I really enjoy it.  Even though it's not something I would play frequently, it is in a short list of games that I really don't want to part with.

3rd ed., 2nd printing, acquired June 2017
Just getting started with this game. A slow burn of strategic plotting and engine building: delicious. The donkeys and geese are so cute that I hate to upgrade them. I'd rather stay in the early stages technology-wise and spiral up in a different manner than just "going modern". Fiddly? Yes, admittedly, but what it offers in long-term planning and engine growth more than makes up for any reservations on that front.

Looking forward to exploring more with this. My first Splotter Spellen and I am hoping they come up with a new game that is solo-friendly. Antiquity comes closest and choosing your end goals is fantastic. But the overwhelming spectre of pollution and graves is too depressing for me in a game, not to mention too fiddly in execution.

I really *want* to love this game.  Every time I read about it I get all excited.  But actually playing it did not live up to my expectations.  Too fiddly and too much micromanagement.  I believe that once you are comfortable enough with the system, you could immerse yourself in it and achieve a zen-like state where you don't notice the fiddliness and micromanagement and just *flow*.  But I couldn't get there.

I'm not very experienced with the game yet, but I have really enjoyed my introduction. The simultaneous movement/conflict resolution dynamic is pretty novel...and seems to work to minimize downtime in what might otherwise be a pretty stop-and-go affair. 

When I started playing, it was a little overwhelming how many different types of chits there are. But its not so bad once you get started. 

I'm looking forward to playing more.  I may have to whip out a couple of these solo scenarios.

RATING: 5
The moniker Civilization (Sid Meier's) in board game form is an apt one for this game, and I can safely say that anyone who liked that computer game, and wasn't bothered by the amount of nitpicky little moves required to do anything, will probably be well-served by giving this a go. Like Civ, careful planning is necessary to build up your factory network and to have the right things available, when and where you need them to save valuable turns. Despite the long game length, the entire thing ends up being a tense attempt to acquire the right resources, and then cash them in for yet more potential gains, and on and on and on. You always want more than you have, and it always feels like the opposition is going to run you over when they get an advance that you don't have yet and start taking advantage of it. The words fiddly do not begin to describe this though, and players who are bothered by micro-management are advised to not only stay away, but to move out of any countries that this game is neighbouring. 

This is intriguing and recommended option for those who like having a seemingly insane array of choices from turn to turn though. I think on one hand that the sheer number of choices will give this game a very long return value, let alone the modular board aspect; and yet I find myself reluctant to pull it out. The time it takes to setup is one factor, as is the actual amount of interaction and payoff. The gameplay slows to a crawl if there is a lot of conflict, but without it the game essentially feels like playing a CPU game like Civ in the company of other players; calling such solitaire would be too strong because you will, even in a light conflict game, on occasion run into each other, but I will say that when such situations fail to come up often enough the multiplayer game feels the same as the single player 'puzzles' to me, except with increased downtime... I might also add that after a few plays, I'm starting to feel like the differences aren't as pronounced as they appear as regards different strategies, it always is, at its heart, a race to get that stock exchange up and rolling. The different buildings you can use to get there, and the different carriers add interest, and yet, it still has a similar feel in that regard. The expansion seems to fix this by adding Art as another avenue to victory, but I think the last thing this game needs is more rules and chits, so I'm at cross-purposes as far as that goes. 

There are many situations where I simply wouldn't want to play this, mainly because of length of game vs. payoff, but there is nothing quite like it either. If this was 1980, all time classic, too fiddly for a modern board game though, would work much, much better as an online or computer interface. Too much work for what I get out of it.

Well worth $100.  Enjoyable components.  One hour per player.  Solo option is cool.  With the expansion, this is totally awesome and more open-ended.  I think one or two players is the best way to play this.  The fight for turn order every few minutes adds a lot of time to the game with each additional player.
I've played a ton of solo sessions now, and I've yet to print a second stock certificate during the Mesopotamia scenario.  Apparently, I suck.  At least I'm getting faster at playing, so look out, world.  Oh, I've only played R&B with other people about ten times.  All the rest of my logged games are solo attempts.
Antiquity is also an excellent Splotter game.  If you like one, you'll probably like the other.

This game runs so smooth that is does not feel like playing 4 or 5 hours.
The basic rules are rather simple (once you extracted them from the large rulebook), but there are lots of exceptions and choices what to buy/build. If you find it too long you can always shorten the gameplay by building a smaller wonder.

Much more enjoyable than Neuland. This game has probably replaced any real desire to seek out Neuland as a game, although Neuland itself is partly responsible for that. This game works quite well with 2 and so impacted the relevant 2 player ratings.

This game is about building a goods production/[b]transportation[/b]/consumption network up and preventing your opponent from using it (also using your opponents hard work when possible). There is a lot of potential for tight aggressive play.

Given it's relative scarcity in gaming circles it's unlikely to come to the table without an active appointment game--I believe jhagen has a copy and know that coolpapa does.

RATING: 8
Played once, 2P. I had a great time learning and exploring this game, but I think I'd much prefer to play 3- or 4-player in the future. With just 2, it's all a zero-sum game: there's no point to localized cooperation with another player if it's going to aid them more than you, so with reasonable skill joint plans simply shouldn't happen. By contrast, it looks like in a 3+ player game that there would be ample opportunity for "we both win" ventures, which would increase intermingling / permeability of borders, the potential for later-game power plays, and other interesting dynamics. (As well as providing some table balance - in our 2P game, it was pretty clear I was going to win by about halfway through, and there wasn't much my opponent could do other than hope I dropped the ball.)

We had physical problems playing due to every dry-erase marker we could find crapping out on us, but even before we resorted to using a neutral player's wonder tiles as roads, the hexes felt very crowded. I wish they'd been a bit bigger. The pictures I've seen seem OK, though, so perhaps it's just getting used to the stacking.

The economic ladder was engaging (though the "geese => technology" thing remains something of a puzzlement), as was its interaction with the game terrains. The title of the game is extremely apt; this really is a game about transit, not ownership, and considering what things can bring what where how quickly along what routes with shifting requirements was a neat way to pass an afternoon (and conclude that I'd done it terribly wrong and should have chosen quite differently).

RATING: 8
It's a heavy brain burning game about logistics and processing. Not only you need to care about which item will be processed into which item, but also the transportation and network for ease process. A lot of foreplanning indeed in this game.

Unfortunately the goal is pretty much the same. The difficulty lies on to calculate the turn, and where should you stop, gold, coin, go for stock exchange. If only there is another way to win, it would be better. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.7
Exceedingly poor production values. The game IS the definition of fiddly...gazillion microscopic chits ALL OF WHICH NEED TO MOVE WITH THE PLAYER EACH TURN. The "roads" are a marker pen they give you which you are supposed to use on the cheap plastic (folded) overlay of all the hexes. I mean this whole contraption is a "DON'T SNEEZE" scenario.

The Splotter boys famous glass blobs are back-and about as useful as usual (not at all). 


And, of course, the world famous outrageous prices for said game.

This is the type of game that is not likely to hit a regular gaming group table but perhaps once every couple of years.

RATING: 7.5
A very clever game system covering advancement from woodcutting to minting coins, on a geomorphic board.  While the geomorphic board ensures that no two games have to have the same layout, the game itself is something of an exercise in perfecting execution of a progression of processes, and resource logistics.  For this reason, some may be turned off by it, or find gameplay somewhat repetitive after several playings.  It is, at its heart, a "puzzle kit", in game clothing.

Broad, in preference to deep, decision trees

Whenever I ask for recommendations along this line in the forums, I just get games that have "lots of decisions". 

That's almost the opposite of what this is about. 

I like games that are not based on action timing or action chaining, but on action selection [see strategy talk above].

Puerto Rico is a good example of the complete opposite of the type of game I like, in this regard. On most of your turns, you will have maybe 3 choices to select from. "Hmmm.... do I take Craftsman now? No wait, next turn they'll be able to take Captain and all of my goods will get wasted. Do I take Trader? Hmmm... I have nothing to trade." 

Even beyond role selection, the choices are limited: "Hmmm.... there are two sugar plantations available to me or one indigo." "Hmmmmm... I have three coins, I can build any of these 5 buildings." The game intentionally limits your choices at any given time to less than half a dozen, making their sequencing rather than their selection the key game idea.

I hate this. I want to have at least a dozen dramatically different viable alternatives of ambiguous utility on my turn.

I don't want my decision trees already pruned for me. 

I like some micro-action games [Antike is one that slides by], but it's not my preference. I do like overlapping micro-actions. 

Roads and Boats is an example of that. Take away the map and the multiple transports, and you have [almost literally] Le Havre, which is a good enough game but nothing special. Roads & Boats is most certainly a game about action timing and action chains, but it differs in that you have to handle dozens of chains at once and figure out how to overlap them effectively.

For this reason, Roads & Boats feels like a "broad" game, even though you can calculate all look-ahead moves to the end of the game.

It's a bunch of mini-maxing, to be sure, but it's kinda fun to me, for some odd reason.  I give it such a high rating, 'cuz I've really enjoyed the three games I've played of it, but I'd like a couple more opportunities 'fore I pass ultimate judgement.  The game you play relies heavily on the map you play and the number of players, which I haven't really experimented with too terribly much unfortunately.

RATING: 8
A very enjoyable (yet very fiddly) logistics game that rewards careful planning and efficiency of network-building. Goods are produced, transported and upgraded to more advanced goods, hopefully ultimately leading to gold, coinage, and--if you're really good, it seems--stock certificates. Players share the game world (which consists of hexes, each denoting a particular terrain type), but begin in their own section. The twist is that no goods belong to anyone unless they are on that player's transporter (donkeys, wagons, trucks and rafts, rowboats, and steamers). Players can earn points by contributing resources each turn to a (generic, unnamed) wonder and by possessing the aforementioned gold, coins or stock certificates. 

Production quality is unique and pleasant on some levels (artwork of box cover and, especially, rulebook), but lacking in others. Mines have tiny transparent draw bags that randomize the mine's production each turn. The technology track beads are too big to all fit on the track. The player aid is in black and white. The coins goods tiles were misprinted in a copper color with a black background, making them barely visible. The wonder "brick" tokens for each player look like those anti-theft devices attached to merchandise. I rounded the corners of all the counters in the game to make them more "Euro" style, and nicer to the look and touch. 

I've played twice now solo, but I'm not logging those plays on BGG.

I really like this game, whether playing it solo, or against other people.  I find the hex map spaces that come with the game too small and confining for all of the items they need to hold.  It has a high learning curve; expext to restart the game when teaching new players, as mistakes made during the opening can remove someone from the game.

Getting all the moving parts to fit together mentally is a serious, serious challenge. Very puzzle-like in a very good way.

Depending on the variable map, you can have a massively-interactive game, or a completely multiplayer solitaire game.

Just too long and heavy for what amounts to a multi-player solitaire logistics exercise, with a struggle to get the gold. Got iron instead of gold? Oh, too bad, you lose.

On top of that, I don't enjoy the fact that there's no way to validate that your opponents are making legal moves without slowing the game down drastically.

Finally had a chance to play. I am going to rate this an 8 for now. That rating will most definitely change, which way I don't know. I like the infrastructure aspect to the game that is in some other games but not prominent.

This game has a lot going on, but after a few turns you get the hang of the interactiveness. The key to this game isn't to screw your opponent, but to use opportunities to the best of your abilities.

I have only played 2 player, but the sweet spot is probably 4 player.

A game that I want to play more, but the commitment is simply too great. A game of many decisions, many with long-term consequences if handled poorly. A lengthy game, which is not for casual gamers.

This game has a lot going on with all the buildings, transports, roads, and resources being generated/used.  I really need to play again to get my head around a strategy.  In my only play, it was a 5er game...it seemed to end right when things started getting going.  Could be a function of the map/play-style.  It all came down to who got the mines and more specifically gold.  Not sure if that is the norm or an aberration.  The game was fiddly with all the counters and who was carrying what.  Also everyone kind of moves at the same time which is very error prone since no one is checking anyone's moves.  Lastly, the plexiglass that came with the game is rolled up like a map and is virtually unusable since it cannot be straightened out easily.

Upped my rating from 6 to 8. Finally after about a decade I got to play again with fewer players.  It took significantly less time than 5er.  We finished in just over 3 hours...including rules!  The result though was similar to last time...the game ended right when things started to get interesting.  I probably need to become more efficient with my moves/builds though.  Everyone seemed to rush the wonder build except me.  I did a lot of work to mint 1 coin....and barely lost.  With a bit more care, I could have minted one more coin and won, but a stock certificate was not going to happen no matter what.  Indeed, mines are very important.

Roads and Boats is a logistical game by Splotter, a company famous for its heavy, immersive games (most notable Antiquity, Indonesia, and Roads and Boats).

The only Splotter games I have played are Indonesia, which I enjoy greatly despite general annoyance at the end game, and Bus, which I did not find to be particularly thrilling. Roads and Boats has been on my radar for a while, but I was never compelled to seek it out, especially since it was frequently compared to Neuland, which I did not find especially interesting.

There were two things that changed this for me:
1) A good, local friend got it and ended up highly impressed with it.
2) A number of members of the GeekChat League - Stingray Division acquiring it and also speaking highly of it.

So a couple weekends ago I went over to Mike's house and we played a three player game of it. I like it. The game wasn't purely smooth sailing as there were some rules misunderstandings and the common mistakes that new players make that resulted in Mike winning quite decisively, but I came away from the game intrigued by the broadness of the decision making process and the seeming openness of the game. In fact I found myself thinking about it quite a bit for the next few days, and examining session reports and game play pictures in great detail, wondering how I would go about establishing and defending myself on these maps. Eventually I decided to purchase it. 

What is great about the game is both its openness and its extendability. While I am sure that particular maps may end up being solved in isolation, the ability of other players to interfere with your plans adds a great detail of possibilities to the game as you have to act against them and react to their aggressions. Additionally, quite a few maps have been published for the game both by Splotter and by fans, making the game's possibilities extend even further. The fact that the game board is made out of tiles makes it easy to design your own maps, and I admit that I am looking forward to the time when I am skilled enough that I can design maps that are fun and interesting for both myself and others to play on. 

Unfortunately my excitement for this one was eventually overcome by the difficulty in setting up and tearing it down, resulting in it hardly ever being played. I sold it.

RATING: 10
Large box game where players start out on a hextile board with three donkeys, two geese, some wood and bricks, and have to turn these into points.  It's all about low level logistics and transportation problems - get goods A to tile B via transport C to produce D required to make E.  Points are awarded for gold, coins, stock bonds, and for contributing to the Wonder (a communial construction that is also the end of game clock).  Clever game, quite long, but it does get you involved.  Can be played friendly and almost solitaire, or as nasty as your play group allows.  Lots of scenarios keeps this one fresh and interesting.  One of the great games - almost infinitely replayable.

Loved my first game of Roads and Boats. Lots of meat and material. 

If it wasn't the fact that this is a very long game, and not everyone can play this game due to it's complexity, this is a game which I would buy right away regardless of its price tag. As for the price tag, it is an very expensive game.

Question you have to ask yourself if you plan to buy/play, how many times this game will hit the table? You got the right people to play Roads & Boats?

I'll believe that this could take 4 hours with two players. Who both know the game well. And play quickly. And are playing on a fairly large map, and thus not interacting much. On which they have played before. Maybe. Single-player, it could probably be whipped off in a couple of hours, but only because the number of turns are so much reduced.Great game, though. The only minus for me is the production quality. I'm missing some wooden bits, and that it comes with *nothing* to organize the thousand-plus bits is really annoying. However, it is great fun, and I expect to be playing it regularly for years.

Okay, I was wrong about the playing it regularly for years. I pulled this out again only a couple times after the initial spate of plays. Finally decided to trade it away.

I enjoy this game in trying to figure out optimal moves and placements given the available resources.  I feel that the game could be played faster than advertised, though I am still playing solo-scenarios, which take me approximately 1 hour to complete.  This game is every bit as fiddy as people have attested.  I usually dislike fiddy games, but my enjoyment of economic games has easily overcome this.  (I haven't found a wargame to be able to do that, however)

[1 play]  What a jolly game.  Have only tried it once so far, but it made a hit first impression.

I've only dipped my toe in the R&B pool at this point, so I can't give a solid comment yet, but I do love what I see so far. Clearly, it's high on the logistics puzzle and low on the interaction, yet my gut says that as everyone gets clever at completing the logistics puzzle, the interaction will play a larger role. In any case, I'm engaged by both aspects after a couple of plays well enough to give it a 9 rating.

Played 1 time. You know, funny thing -- now that I am used to the relatively short time of an average &#039;German&#039; game (75-100 mins), 4 hours seems like a lot of time. Now when I play Die Macher, it doesn&#039;t bother me -- that game is elegant, plays at a good pace and is involving, and allows for a lot of strategy. Well, Roads &amp; Boats is 4 hours long and has a lot of strategy, but sadly, the game is SO fiddly that it takes forever to do anything. Tons of downtime. The theme is fantastic, a GREAT concept, and if this game had come out 20 years ago, it would be a classic, but we live in the computer age, and this game is something that a computer handles far better: clear information (R&amp;B has chits everywhere and gets very crowded), click a mouse instead of moving around upwards of 40 chits each per turn -- EACH (! it takes a long time, small hands, and narrow fingers) etc. The fiddliness of it killed the enjoyment factor. great concept -- mega-bog down. Just not worth the time required (and don&#039;t forget, setup and tear down time on this is huge too -- unlike Die Macher.)

This was an interesting game.  Due to the 5-player setup I was off behind a large swath of water, untouched by other players for the whole game.

I wound up winning as I was able to mint some mined gold into money right before we had to call it a night.

After playing a second time with 3, I can see why people like this, however it seems a bit samey in that you're doing the same things every game and the only real variability is in how much of a pain your neighbors are going to be.

3rd play - the sameness as the previous 2 games continues.  Everyone pretty much always builds a sawmill and whatever gets you bricks, along with 2 or 3 primary produces.  Couple that with not building on your home, water, and the location of your enemies, leads everyone looking more or less like everyone else other than maybe 1 or 2 production buildings if they happen to have a free hex or 2.  I was a bit bored by the whole thing as I didn't feel like I was really doing anything interesting or different than the previous times.

Overall just a meh from me.

This was a nice tall glass of nope! The game is not even half finished in my opinion and would require some major graphics design overhaul to ever hit my table again. I hdislike this for the same reason I dislike SUDOKU. The ouzzle is not complex as long as you take your time with it and are really thurough. But that is just BORING!

I'm not quite sure what to think of this after just one play; my rating could go up.  Despite the long playing time and the assload of pieces, the rules are fairly simple and easy to learn.  There is a lot of difficult logistical planning here, and the game gives you some of the feel of computer games such as Civilization.  I greatly enjoyed the first two-thirds of the game, but eventually the micromanagement and all the shuttling of little pieces started to become tedious.  Too many pieces, too much upkeep, too much to keep track of each turn.  I love the idea here, but wonder whether the whole enterprise is something that would be better managed by a computer.

I like logistics games and pick-up/deliver games, and expected to like this a lot more than I did. My generally favorable opinion after a solo game nosedived after a three-player experience. More puzzle than game, and as a puzzle it is more tedious than fun; the long play time and (frankly) ugly components ensure I won't be going back to this one with other players any time soon. And so for me it is an expensive solo puzzle game worth playing every once in a great while.

Interesting logistics game that I've been hoping to play for a while. I played with two other new players and one experienced player who was teaching us and managed to come second so that felt pretty good. It's one of those games where you want to do 50 different things on your turn but can only do 10, so it's frustrating in a fun way. I only managed to acquire wagons as my best form of transport but did get a stock exchange built. Love the geese too.

RATING: 3
Played with 5, and I have to say I thought it sucked.  I got stuck between 2 other players who just rolled right into me, while the two guys on the end had very little interaction with anyone, and won.  This game so sooo fiddy, maybe the fiddiest game I've ever played.  Impossible to check to see if the other players are playing correctly and so easy to make mistakes.  Lots of rules questions about who can pick up what and when.  Theme is just tacked on.  The gameplay does not really represent anything that could be viewed in realistic manner.  Just a big move-optimizing puzzle, with lots of screwage.  Just not worth the playing time and fiddiness to me.  I'll try this maybe once more, but not with 5 again.

Don't be afraid of the long playing time: Despite the huge piece counts, this game doesn't feel like a 4 hour behemoth.

Roads and Boats feels like a computer strategy game. There's an economic structure like in the Railroad Tycoon series, movement and upgrade decisions that resemble Civ, and even a research mechanism! With simultaneous movement, all players can be constantly engaged in the game, avoiding the downtime issues of many empire building games. There's some fiddliness, but it's significantly less than you'd think based on the game's component count.

If you've not played this one, you haven't lived. You want to live, right? :)

RATING: 6
Deep and complex game.  Actually, it is not that it is all that difficult (although the rules are quite an undertaking.)  It's just that there is so much to do.  The game is tedious with all the little chits and transporters and shuffling them around the board.  I played a two player game and it lasted a good six hours.  I thought that was too long, but I'm sure we would get that down with some experience.  I played a solo game and I thought that was more fun.  I wonder if the solo game is the sweet spot with Roads and Boats.  I give the game a 6.  I can't give it higher because it is just too darn long and tedious.  There is a kind of drudgery associated with the game.....  I've now decided I actually might get rid of it.  It is too darn long and tedious!  My girlfriend doesn't like it.  It just won't get played much.  Update:  Traded away in 05/2009 for Maharaja, Medici vs. Strozzi, Wyatt Earp, and OOP Medina.  Roads and Boats is overrated and way too expensive.  Is the Roads and Boats experience really worth the combined game playing fun of the four games I traded it away for?  I think not!

I never want to play this game again.  I believe that the players have to abide by a spirit in this game, of building your own things and actually doing work rather than steal everything you can from another player you happen to be near as much as you possibly can.  The game can be incredibly confrontational and annoying.  And way way way too long. I would play neuland 3 times in the time it took for us to degenerate into squabbling over this game.

RATING: 8
After several false starts, we finally got this one to the table! Hope to do so again soon.  We played cooperatively with a single-player scenario, so I don't know what playing competitively would be like. However, I very much enjoyed the way we played.  

The real constraint here is that it's only possible to put one building on a hex.  So you come into this world in which there are many things that you can theoretically build, but in reality, you can only have a few of them, and you'd better choose carefully what they are.  Don't count on the desert.  And moving things around is a charmingly, exquisitely irritating proposition--it's not like you can just put them wherever you want. So there are a lot of moments when you find yourself saying, "All I have to do is get that over there! Which I can do if.. ah.. hm."  

Good stuff.  I'm a fan of pick up and deliver games in general, but this is different.  And intriguing. (1 play)

I liked R&B right away, but I wondered if it would become less interesting as it became more familiar. In fact, it did just the opposite. After you reach the point where conflict becomes an issue, it's amazing how intricate the possibilities and counter-possibilities become. I'm very impressed by the simple mechanisms that drive the game. The deeper you dig, the richer it gets.

Good game, but ultimately not a game that I'd choose to spend my several hours on given the state of the hobby. There are numerous other games I'd choose first, so I sold R&B. Had I found this in 1999, I might have been more inclined to play (though things like crayon rail and Merchant of Venus would have been stiff competition, so the end result might have been similar anyway).

A very fun economy builder with an emphasis on logistical, spatial, and temporal planning. Cool theme. Extremely fun. I don't know why, but it surprised me how very much I delighted in playing Roads & Boats. A much more enjoyable experience for me than Food Chain Magnate and Indonesia, the latter of which I enjoy. I enthusiastically recommend Roads & Boats. This is a dense, heavy, yet delicious game experience. Roads and Boats takes a long time to play. Analysis paralysis is a certainty, and it is the very most compelling form of AP I have ever seen. An extremely fiddly affair on a scale seen nowhere else but these Splotter joints. The fun game play rewards the fine motor skills/dexterity challenge.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b]

It's [i]"Minecraft"[/i]! You won't realize how true it is until you try it for yourself. Each resource can be combined to build factories for cutting wood, excavating stone, and mining gold. You can breed your animals and research technologies for oil rigs, boats, airports, powerplants and trucks. You can specialize in pottery for art exhibits or mint gold for stock bonds. 

 After every game I wish I had the time to play again immediately as I know I can do every map better. So be prepared to sink a lot of time into this classic, just like the real [i]"Minecraft"[/i]. 

[b]Expansion Review:[/b]

I acquired [i]"& Cetera"[/i] at the same time as the base game, so I haven't played without it. And I can definitely say I don't want to. The additions of powerplants, planes, art exhibits and trains are things that only add more depth to the game without adding any confusing new mechanics. 

Now I'm only hoping they decide to release some more building types to spice things up even further.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- It's immensely satisfying to see all your hardwork pay off with an amazing looking empire by the end of the game. 
- The table presence is immaculate.
- You always have long-term and short-term goals setup clearly in your mind.
- There is no down time as everyone is doing their actions simultaneously. 
- Every map is unique with a new puzzle to solve.
- People don't get upset over loosing. They often just enjoy the ride and take pride in seeing their own plans reach fruition.  

[b]Cons:[/b]
- It's a long game. Most games fall between 2 and 3 hours. I rarely get weary playing board games, but I usually need two or three breaks to stretch my legs while playing roads and boats. 
- There are mountains of chits to manage. It's by far the most fiddly game I know. 
- Setup and pack-up time is humongous, even with everything in Plano boxes. 
- It's easy to become oblivious to other players plans. 
- The thieving rules seem a little unnecessary in a largely multiplayer-solitaire game, as well as underdeveloped.

I've only played this solo so far but I can tell already that this is my kind of game. It's just grabs me to have all these resources that I have to use to transform into different items and factories which can then be used for other things, etc.

In a way, it reminds me of a toy I had as a kid where a dumptruck would pick up black balls, travel down a road, dump them for the next truck, and then the next truck would then pick up the balls, dump them back into the dumptruck, who would then go up the hill and  dump them into a container for the original dumptruck to pick up again! That toy was amazing and that's what this game reminds me of and it gets me very, very excited.

I also like the control it requires in your transportation networks.

From what I have read, I would really like this game.  However, it is very expensive.  Since I need to get far more plays of many great games, I shouldn't rush to buy any pricey games.

Snagged it off ebay for what seemed to be a good deal.  Had it shipped to Ashton in California a few weeks before my move - looking forward to playing it!

First learning play in - very cool system, but need several more plays before I feel like I have a handle on it.

Sold as it was just sitting on the shelf and not getting played.  Learned my lesson in paying a premium for a rare game when it doesn't necessarily mean a better game.

I really wanted to like Roads & Boats.  Actually, I do still admire it, but when it comes down to playing the game I'd rather play something else.  Roads & Boats brings out the AP in me and also makes me get *extremely* frustrated.  I don't like feeling that way and so I had to come to the sad realization that it's not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
In Roads & Boats, players use transporters (donkeys, wagons, trucks and various watercraft) to move resources from one region to another in order to build factories that in turn produce more specialized and valuable resources.  The game is essentially a puzzle where players have to decide what to produce, where to produce it, and how and when to transport raw materials to various processing centers.  What makes the game intriguing is that there is no private ownership of the land or means of production.    As the rule book states "There is no concept of territory in this game: you cannot own land, nor buildings, so the things you build can be used by another player."

I've only scratched the surface of the game, but am intrigued by my experience so far.  You start out poor and, if you've made good choices, you end up with a thriving logistical network linking raw material producers with various specialized factories.  The victory point generating resources (particularly gold coins and stock certificates) require careful planning to produce.  This is the pinnacle of engine-building.

I really like the whimsical art and graphic design.  Instead of giving the game a dirty, industrial feel, the art puts the players in an idyllic setting that reminds players of the beauty surrounding their industrialized network.  The 4th Edition's  high quality components complement the superb game.

I received Roads & Boats as a father's day gift in June, 2014.

It's like Settlers of Catan on some serious steroids! What a great game, where you always need to do a lot more things then you're able to. You can't quite get to where you need to go and people keep stealing "your" resources! It has a long play time and it can definitely give you a headache trying to efficiently plan out your turn. There's been complaints about set-up time but after playing games like Battlelore and Heroscape, this doesn't seem very bad.  I use a counter tray for all the goods which makes set-up VERY easy anyway.

Rated after a two solo plays and a single 3-player game.  Ouch, my brain hurts... but in a good way.  It's a good sign when you play and immediately want to try again to improve your strategy and score.  I can only see the score for this one going up.  Starting with a simple set of resources you try to plan out an optimal usage and growth strategy. Thanks to fungamescafe.com for providing me a way to obtain this game.  My score improved for the second game, getting to mint my first coin.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (February 2016)

I had huge expectations from Roads & Boats and my desire to play it was very high. Some friends speak of it as a grail game and it is a Splotter game. I found the game to be unlike any other I have played, but still I didn’t have as much fun as I thought I would have from it.

The rules aren’t complex, but reading them from the rulebook is harder than it should be, that is, the rulebook could be a lot clearer. You can explain them under 25-30 minutes. Playtime is around 3-4 hours.

The game components are very regular (as is usual from Splotter) but there are almost a thousand pieces (with the game expansion). As is also usual from Splotter, the game IS very expensive and the components don’t look the part, they feel cheap and are hard to handle. I particularly dislike the plastic sheet. For me it was a disaster, very hard to handle and we had to tape it to the table, then when we packed the game some glue remained on the sheet. The pen that comes with the game doesn’t come off easily. I don’t know why they decided to do it this way. It would have been better for me to denote the roads with wooden sticks (like the walls). I don’t see why we have to draw them, this complicates everything! If I keep the game I need to find a solution for this.

Roads & Boats comes in a big box (like Antiquity).

The game decisions aren’t easy, in fact you have to carefully plan what, where and how you are going to produce what you need, I like this part of the game a lot. The main goal is to produce gold, stocks and coins and at the same time help to build the wonder. Nothing else give you VPs. It is a logistical nightmare, but I enjoy it :D. Some of my friends found the game to be very hard. I like that you can influence how long the game takes, that can throw off the timing of some opponents :devil:.

If a player doesn’t have access to a sawmill he can lose the game right there because all the other buildings (but the Stock Exchange) require boards. I almost didn’t build it in my first game, but a friend helped me and pointed out I was going to make a big mistake.

I have only played it once and with an easy scenario. I love that players have the option to use scenarios or to create the world from scratch, but in this case players need to be experienced.

The game can be played as a solitaire puzzle, semi cooperative or very aggressive, it depends on the group. 

On the bad side, the game feels dated, it is uber-fiddly, it is easy to cheat (intentional or intentionally) or to make mistakes. There seem to be lots of buildings to choose from but little time to build them, that is, when you build the more powerful ones the game is about to end. Upkeep is repetitive and, again, players can make a mistake easily here. The mines give a random ourpout and you (most of the time) want gold but sometimes get iron. Iron is much less important than gold so I feel there is an unbalance here. I know you can change this by researching, but still it feels fishy to me. I would have liked for iron to play a bigger role, as it is, it seems very weak to me. The rulebook doesn’t have a list of components. How am I supposed to know if my game is complete? (I bought it second hand). Fortunately a fellow BGGeek made a super document listing all the components of the base game and the expansion.
 
Bottom line, I was expecting something better, it is a very expensive game with very regular components. I almost feel bad writing this, the game being a grail game and all but it takes too long for what it offers and it is very fiddly and repetitive. I respect the design a lot (thus the high rating) but my desire to play it again is rather low. It is an unique game but I didn´t have much fun playing it. I already bought the expansion (I think no other Splotter game has an expansion, weird) but I’m leaning toward selling them both. I also need to revisit my opinion of Antiquity because I played it a long time ago and I have changed a lot these past years, so perhaps I will dislike it now. I already bought Food Chain Magnate and The Great Zimbabwe and I’m thinking that perhaps it was a mistake, it could be that Splotter games are not for me (except for Indonesia which I really like). It also could be that I need to give the game more opportunities to woe me, but I don’t see myself spending that kind of time playing it when there are other boardgames that I really want to play. Still, I can see why people like the game.

Not at all an insult to say this is my least favorite of the "big three" Splotter games.  Fiddly like the other titles, but without as much tension as the others.  More of a game system than a game.  Very good though.

Downrating to an 8 - of the games in its class (2-4 hour play time, ridiculous amounts of resource counters) I'm realizing I'd rather play most of the others than R&B.  That's not to be critical of this game, just how it is.  For all the fun of logistics, there isn't all that much to do with the resources once you get them besides the neverending churn for stock certificates.  I'll still play this game any time.

RATING: 7
This is my first play of this game and it was fun and engrossing (I had about 4 hours sleep the night before and still was completely involved in the game, no yawning or mind wandering here  ) - You are actively involved almost all the time in this game trying to keep apprised of what everyone else is doing and trying to keep your plan in focus. (if you have a plan) The game mechanics are extremely simple, produce, move, build, add to monument - just 4 phases, almost no contentious rules issues. All that said, there are several games that provide the same scratch for the itch and that do it better. It seems to be more of a puzzle than a game; and there really is only one way to win the game (although there may be several ways to get to that point) and that is with the stock exchange and stocks - their VP value just means that you can't win if you don't have the same number or more than anyone else... We played with no geese stealing and a preset board. It was on my list to buy the reprint; it is now off my list; although I would be happy to play this anytime. The game took about 4.5 hours with 2 newbies and two 1-gamers.

This is easily the game I've least enjoyed in 2011 and as far back as last ORIGINS where I played "Defenders of the Realm" (Arkham designer). I won the game but we didn't quite have the correct way of placing the VP's. 
This game needs a technology flow chart like in a PC game so you can get an idea of where to go. VERY confusing and I hate, hate, hate marking roads on acetate (like the train games of Empire Builder).

Bought for single-player puzzle gaming, however, if I can eventually engage one or more family members to play, my rating for this game will go to 10.  I use instead, our (Wizard King) 1/8" plexiglass board to cover and (TransAmerica) 1" black rods for roads.  Very happy to finally include this game in our collection.

The ultimate logistics game. A brain burner for sure. After I play I always want to play again and try things differently. There are an incredible variety of set ups independently published if you don't want to make up your own which increase or decrease interactions to suite your taste. If you end up liking and keeping the game, you should invest in a proper piece of plexiglass from your local TAP Plastics. It is 500% better than the roll of plastic included with the game.

The player interaction and the ability to recover from early mistakes (just be sure to build a sawmill!) are both better than I was lead to believe reading about the game.

If you've played a few other Splotter titles, it's easy to find a common ancestor in Roads and Boats. Game length based on player actions, variable board development based on player actions, complicated resource conversions, etc. Viewing R&B through the lens of more recent games, I would call it Le Havre with logistics (and I'm certainly not the first person to say so). Build a woodcutter, quarry, and sawmill, refine the lumber, build a coal-burner, create fuel, dig a mineshaft, discover gold/iron, pave roads, build wagons/trucks/rafts/boats, etc. etc. etc. Eventually players will crown their raw resource economies with mints and stock exchanges, which lead to the massive scoring opportunities.

Roads and Boats does not put pressure on players directly, which means the interaction needs to do all the heavy lifting for it to be a satisfying game. Depending on how you set up the modular board at the start, players will either race each other over 3-4 hours, running their own private economies, or they will be constantly interfering with each other's opportunities. I learned the game on the "efficiency race" setting, which was perfect for grasping the rules and game-flow. Now that I know how it works, I would want to play on a tight map where everyone's construction choices affected everyone else, and all goods were essentially in "the commons." Until I do that, I can't really assess the game's potential. Seems good. Is it better than good? I'm not sure.

This is really a great operations research type of game. It's all about logistics and planning and supply chain optimization. Totally up my alley!

Fortunately it works well solitaire, so there are no excuses for me to not get some play out of this.

For me, a nearly perfect play experience combining several of my favorite mechanisms (city building, route/network, PU&D, and logistics) in the closest thing I've seen to a sandbox experience in a non-digital environment.  The play time and availability prevent this from being a game for anyone, but delivers an experience well worth the time and effort.

RATING: 8
There's definitely a lot going on, but after a few turns (like any game), it's pretty simple to figure out and is surprisingly intuitive in play.  As long as all the players play at roughly the same speed there's very little downtime.  It gives you a sense of accomplishment to develop a productive little civilization.  The game lends itself to pretty solitary empire-building, though I guess there's as much interaction and conflict as the players desire.  It didn't take as long as I thought it would, and the time actually passes very quickly while playing.  Many will complain of fiddliness, but it's not unwieldy - I think the stacks of counters actually lend a sort of charm.  I look forward to playing this again soon.

I'm using this game as an experiment in heavier games.  I'm not into wargames (war history doesn't do anything for me) so this appealed to me.  I also liked the fact that it can be soloable, in case my wife doesn't like it.
Update: So far I find it a bit too brain-burning for me. There's so much to keep track of and with the fiddly chits I lose track of what I did during my turn constantly. Not really my cup of tea so far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A logistics case study turned into a game. The rules clearly define a system of value added steps. Maximizing your end value requires an analysis of the specific terrain to aid material flow and minimize bottlenecks. The archetype game of "tonnes of things to do." It does take a long time to play but it doesn't feel like it and with simultaneous action, there isn't much down time. Interaction is usually minimal but often critical (theft vs cooperation). High on the "fiddly" scale. A truly viable solitaire game (puzzle). Not just an expensive grail game, it deserves play. Worth the price and I'd have paid even more for double-sided chits.

As with Indonesia this game is full of little bits of cardboard, but it is also a great game. Lots of opportunity for both strategic and tactical play. The game can be as friendly or cutthroat as you wish. It could if you wished even be played co-operatively just for fun. I prefer the logistical chains and planning in this to that offered by Neuland.

This game is really mechanical. Its all about logistics and thus it is really kind of a dry and boring experience. You have to move every little chit on the map and make sure that they move to the right place at the right time. As you can imagine it gets old very fast. Also the game takes a long, long time to play.

This game reminds me of Settlers the PC game but not in a good way. I'm going to stick to Le Havre and 18XX games, which are overall much better games.

Intuitive, great resource, transportation sandbox game. One downside is you can get stuck early on and have to play for another three hours with a high chance of not being able to come back. Many people would probably dislike this, but it happened to me, but I still enjoyed playing trying to figure out what to do better next time. There are plenty scenarios and you can make the map any way you want. So plenty of replay value. This is a very niche game so good luck finding people to play and enjoy it!

Epic logistics game. Main focus is on production and transportation of goods, although conflict will be almost unavoidable later in the game (when the roadnetworks get connected, walls are erected and a battle for the goods starts). Interesting technology tree and well designed game mechanisms, but the game play is too long (especially with three or four players) and becomes a bit stereotype in the long run. Don't forget to build on the monument and definitely aim for either coins or (even better) shares.

It was very difficult to get to more advanced buildings on our first play. I find it hard to imagine how it might be possible to get these developments and since I view that as a problem with the game mechanic I still need to see a round go a different way. The huge difference in victory points was also remarkable - one player got stuck at 23 points and the winnig player got 141 - which is an enourmous difference.

But i will give it another chance...

I'm still not sure if this is a game or just a large community puzzle/logic problem. Yet everytime I play I feel like I've just experienced something important. It's extremely hard to explain in a short paragraph, but I can recommend that if you can find a copy, grab it and hang on to it. This is basically an RTS in boardgame format so a computer would take this and make it into a formula, removing all elements of fun. The challenge is trying to think through all the probabilities on your own and throwing in the human element of opponents. Simply fascinating!

This game is tedious and drags along slowly and it is quite lengthy.  I wouldn't even attempt this with more than three players.  Oddly enough, solitaire seems optimal or even two players.  The game play itself is very interesting, there are loads of buildings and many layers of strategy and complexity and scale.  By the time I decide to and go try to build a couple of the grandiose buildings, the game will likely end.  After one play, it does seem grueling and highly formulaic engine efficiency game of wide scale and breath.  It seems like a fairly complex and interesting game but I'm not sure it will be fun and enjoyable for me, especially with the heavy time investment.  To be honest, it is an excellent long game with lots of details but I would much rather play Neuland (which has similar levels of formulas/equations to build, has higher tension & interaction between players and plays in half the time).

A quintessential pick up and deliver game.

Our first game was 4 hours including the rules explanation for 4 players. I agree with our teacher that more than 4 would take a serious commitment from all involved and the understanding that you may be looking at 1-1.5 hours more per player.

It's a game everyone should play at least once, though it's arguable which is better between this and Antiquity. They're different offerings, so it's really hard to play favorites.

One final thought is that I would probably have been more taken with the game had I not seen further plays take 5 hours; and another factor is having played other pick up and deliver games before this one, all of which are much shorter and nearly as satisfying.

I just wish it didn't take an hour for this game to really get going.

The rules state "understanding comes with experience", making it a kind of Zen thing, but it's true. One play is not enough to fully appreciate the intricacy of the game. Ten plays is not enough. Take your time Grasshopper.

We played on a beginner's layout and I would like to see how it plays with 3 as well as on a tighter map.  Nice logistics, though!

With a couple more plays, this is a nice game system.  My third board was very constrained with 4 players and only 3 mountain hexes which made it wonder heavy and only last 2 hours.

5+ plays, 2, 3, and 4 players

It is a strange game to me. It has both aspects I like much and aspect I don't like.

Aspect I like much:
It requires long term planning, but not too analyzable. In fact there are too many factors to consider, it is practically impossible to analyze all that matters perfectly.

Various resources and plants are well-organized. It is interesting figuring how they are reciprocally intergrated.

It is full of beautiful bits. They arouse satisfying civ-building feelings. (Well, I don't mind fiddliness)

Aspects I don't like:
Early mistake cant put you practically out of game. The rich get richer.

Moves are too mechanistic and without much freedom, so there are rarely dramatic phases.

It can be played interactively, that is, aggresively, but interactive play seems to be out of spirit of this kind of game. Solitarily play is more satisfying, but I don't like multiplayer-solitaire.


Anyway, I relatively enjoys playing this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Brilliant as a game idea but as time passes is getting harder and harder to plan your moves, thus becoming very tiring. I have played only the 3-player "The Triangle" scenario, so I would like to play again, a more compatitive scenario and see what happens. Probably I will rise my rating. I think that it should be a very good solitaire game, too.

I like pickup and delivery games -- and this is the mother of all. It's one long game of picking up and delivering stuff.

I also like to build things that will later benefit you. This is the case here as well; not only do you build all kinds of buildings for producing stuff ranging from clay and trunks to coins and shares, but you can also improve your transporting possibilites by upgrading your transporters and improving your road network.

Another good thing is that you can play this game in a peaceful way (without much player interaction), but you can also play it very nasty, with conflicts arising almost every turn. It all depends on how you put together the modular board.

Finally, this game is suitable for one player gaming!! The one-player scenario's are actually puzzles in wich you try to maximize your score in a customized 20-turn game. I've spend many hours figuring out new strategies already.

The downside? It's long. From two hours for a peaceful two-player game, to as much as six hours for a dense four-player game.
It's fiddly too, requiring steady hands and a stable table, as it uses vast amount of tiny chits.

Initially, I gave this game a 9, but I now raised it to 10.

This game is very open to play style and strategy. For me it shines with moderate dose of aggression, diplomacy and cooperation. As with all of three big Splotter games I enjoy the challenges of map reading.

R&B like negotiation games can shine or break down to revenge and solitaire.
note: since sep-2013 started to play on board solitaire and log them.

[19.mar.2012] Corrected from 10 to 9. To show that Go & Bridge are better. 9 is maximum now I give to modern boardgames.

Two plays with 4P.  Not as long as people had said - 3 hours and 2.5 hours for us.  Some bumps along the way, the rules are okay though.  Certainly a brain-burner and has some fiddliness, but no more than something like Through the Ages.  Definitely plays longer than it feels, since you are engaged constantly through simultaneous play.

After 2 more plays, rating is a 7.  A real brain-burner where with limited experience you really are limited in your choices to succeed.  Concerned about replayability.

Multiplayer solitaire.  The drawing-on-the-board mechanics of this game are ugly and awkward to play around, but the game is fun and interesting. The designers certainly did come up with a cool game system. Similar to (if uglier) Antiquity, but plays better, as the victory conditions here felt a little less rigid.  In the latter game, I felt as though I needed to recognize and commit to a path to victory quite a long time before I got there; I didn't get that feeling quite as strongly from this game (such flexibility being a plus in my mind).

Ah, very good - purely based on a first play - not nearly as fiddly as I feared, and the far-reaching implications of even innocuous early choices will prevent it from becoming procedural, not to mention the very prominent threat of interaction (though I'll admit, the majority of the playtime is mostly solitary optimisation)!

Roads & Boats I admire more than I enjoy. I was initially thrilled by it, then dropped my rating and sold my copy.

Terrific game. I find the low-tech ambiance of the game (geese, donkeys, rafts and wagons) to be very charming. Have only played solo. The one-player puzzles at Splotter's site are VERY challenging. My first attempts were abysmal but now I'm starting to get the hang of things. (Studying the solution to "Sea for One" really helped me understand how the game works.) Also own the Planes & Trains expansion but haven't tried it yet. [20 plays]

RATING: 7
Rated an 8 after 2 plays. An engrossing, complex game of logistics and production. Actually, its more of a kit than a game. Some of the things I really like about R&B:
- reasonably good as a solitaire game;
- good player interaction;
- rewards long-term strategy; 
- well-written rules - very little clarification needed;
- virtually no randomness (apart from the mines);
- its fun even if you're not winning;
- should have lots of replay value;
- best pick-up-and-deliver game I've played.
Things I don't like about R&B:
- an inefficient start is difficult to recover from;
- takes a couple of games to become familiar with the rules and to be effective with production and logistics;
- the administration of the economic system is a bit fiddly (bring tweezers!);
- the hexes are large but can still be too small to stack all the goods, transporters and factory if the hex is split by a river;
- should be played with an even number of players;
- storing the many pieces requires some thought and some clever use of third-party storage devices (eg tackle box, counter trays, ziplocks);
- needs a large table (or smaller table with side table) to play.
Update: After a few games under my belt, I think that this is a bit too long for what it is, and the engrossing logistics puzzles can seriously burn you brain. I still think its a great game, but you have to be mentally ready for it. Its not a Friday night game but more of a game that you start at about 1100, break for lunch halfway and then finish by about 1400. It also needs a couple of games for players to become really familiar with the economic system. The challenge is working out the minimum number of buildings you need, locating them efficiently and then reducing opportunity cost of transport. The main dilemma is that transporters have so many critical functions other than transporting - supervising building, research, being upgraded, and guarding resources from your opponents. You just never seem to have enough transporters!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
Despite the long play time the game changes so much during the play that it really doesn't get boring or repetitive. 
The game develops as your "engine" builds towards generating the game winning share certificates.
The game varies a lot between the various map setups, and you need to select one that will appeal to you and give you the style of game you are looking for (e.g. A lot of interaction, the need for water transport etc.).
Overall it is well worth the investment in time and money (as the game is nicely produced).
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Cumbersome, fiddly, and seemingly illustrated by a moderately talented eleven year old child, this is a truly awesome game that rises miles above its flaws and demands tremendous respect.  The sandboxy nature of the game, the modular playing field, and the feeling of being thrown to the wolves right from the get-go can be overwhelming, but they also provide a vast amount of replay value.  Roads & Boats may be the single best "desert island" game out there.

Based on one play with four players, my rating is still subject to change. There's a lot here to like, a lot here to think about, and a lot here to manipulate... maybe too much. We played on the suggested beginner setup that offered lots of room to do your own thing. Some 5 or 6 (we lost track) hours later, we had reached about the middle of the game and decided to call it quits. At that point we all understood the mechanics and had a decent idea of what we wanted to do (and how many blunders we made early on based on our cluelessness). We did have some player interaction, too. The consensus was that there needed to be a bigger battle over resources to keep things more interesting. Yes, the logistical decisions do hold interest on their own, but after a while, it's just chit-pushing as you slowly make your way to the next thing you are trying to build. Even with more familairity, this is a game that is going to take a LONG time, as you need to do some evaluating each turn (especially if there is conflict) and the physical process of moving your units is just plain time consuming. I do look forward to playing this again to see whether the trouble of the gameplay is outweighed by the fun it delivers - right now I just can't answer that, though I am hoping it will prove true.

I like this game, but I prefer other games of Splotter Spellen. Reason: it appears to me as a puzzle, searching through calculation for an optimum path, while I prefer games that do not have an optimum solution and that give more room to the intuitive and creative side of the mind.

But I may change my mind, if I manage to play it more. And it is surely a game that I like much more than average, in any case.

The components are awful, their design is confusing in some cases. I know it’s not a mass market game, but for its price range and taking account its success and after those many reprints, it’s reasonable to expect something better.

It's an economic game that mimics some old videogames with different resources, production buildings and transportation. The rules are not very complicated and they are very intuitive.

Probably the best feature of Roads & Boats is its "customability". The map you play it will change the gameplay in a very significant way. It can provide "solo multiplayer puzzle-like" experiences or very mean games with plenty of interaction. Just change a few tiles from your last game and the tactic and strategies needed will change a lot.

Obviously, its length can be an issue and I think that the tile layout can totally destroy the balance. Having early access to wood and stone is essential. There are many pre-made setups that are completely balanced and you can always design some symmetrical ones.

My main complains are the high level of micromanaging the game needs and the fact that scoring only (or mainly) takes in account gold, something that limits the viable strategies.

RATING: 8
First impression (3 players): The game is simplier than it first looks. There are lots of different looking pieces but most of them are just different goods needed to build different things. You need most likely one game to really understand how stuff works and what you would want to do but basically it isn't that hard. 

The core of the game is logistics problems. How to produce needed resources, perhaps develop them first into different resources before carrying to the building site. It's enough brain burner in itself already but then you have other players. Every building can be used by any player (first come, first served) and so can be any resource laying on the ground (and there will be lots of them). So there is interaction for sure. Buildings cannot be destroyed or resources that your own pieces carry cannot be taken but there is plenty of chances for mischiefs. I like the balance there is with interaction between players.

R&B's biggest problem for me personally is the amount of micro-management there is in the game. There are LOTS of resources and then when you have enough transporters they carry some resources. At some point it is too easy to forget while moving your pieces if you've already moven some of them.

One single rule that especially liked was the one where you can always request for a turn order change before a phase. Naturally if you don't want to pick first you get better position for later rounds/phases.

Overall the game is a very good.

Heavy logistics game. There's a PBEM site that makes this monster a bit easier (i.e., less-fiddly) but is still a heavy brain-burner. As a solitaire game, it's effectively a giant puzzle.

When it does actually make it to the table (length, required intensity being the negative factors), I tend to get totally engrossed. You start with 3 donkeys, 5 planks, 2 geese and 1 stone. And move them around to end up building sawmills, wagons, factories, stock exchanges, gold mines; in fact a whole vertically integrated enterprise aimed at extracting more value from the land than the other players. You mostly play simultaneously, only taking turn order into account when you're about to interfere with each other which doesn't mostly happen until mid to late game because until then you're so intent on maximising your own portion of the world. The downside is that the 'max output into the wonder' strategy is tending to be the winning strategy, not allowing non-wonder players to compete, ending the game before they can realise their grandiose schemes.

This game feels like "The Settler" computergame. Just the managing of the various ressources must be done by the players themself. Therefore the game gets very fiddly as soon as the various production buildings start to begin their work. Still a very nice game (obviously, as it borrows heavily on the computergame :-) )

RATING: 6
It is a fairly step based game, by that I mean that you need to follow specific steps in order to reach a point where you get points. Although you can donate some goods at the end of each round to get points, you get a lot more points by getting resources and using them to build new buildings that produce better resources and then using those resources again to produce better resources, eventually getting something that is worth a lot of points. A little tedious and impossible to keep track of others while focusing on yourself (unless you want to double the length of the game). It is the ultimate economic engine game but often played in a very solo fashion with minimal effect on others.

Holy chits batman! This game is amazing. It's great fun to be able to draw on a board. Yes it's fiddly and yes it can be long, but man do you feel like you're creating quite the empire when all you start out with is a couple of donkeys, some geese, wood and stone.

Really need more plays of this game, but it's a brain burner. Highly recommended.

Genius of a game. Rules are fairly easy but developing a winning strategy will test the limits of your brain power. The game is a masterpiece. The only thing that keeps it from perfection is that I would have liked to have more opportunity to screw up other people's development.

An absolute favorite of mine. A logistics-heavy development game with plenty of variety in map setup and resulting strategies. Also pretty fun as a solo puzzle game. I love the experience of starting with a few donkeys and some geese and a couple boards and ending up with a developed transportation network, advanced technology, and stocks. Roads and Boats really provides that SimCityesque satisfaction of having done something over the course of the game.

4th edition of this game orginally from 1999 and you sort of feel that this game dates from the late 90's: poor graphic design, poor quality of the chits, tiles who are too small to store things proparely and what's whith the plastic sheet for drawing roads and bridges? As for value for money, I sort of have the same feeling as with 'The Great Zimbabwe': too expensive for what you actually.

The game itself: a game with a quite hard learning curve it seems to be. Becomes also a bit repetitive near the end as you are again getting trunks, boards,... for converting into the stuff you need. It's certainly not a bad game, but I'm wondering if I will ever play this again?

The ultimate in micro-management.  The game really emphasizes thought out actions, and player interactions through not enough space will certainly add some very interesting tension.  While there is no "war" in this game, the conflict is almost immediate while players work to help each other but make sure they get the best of both worlds.  Although long, very, very fun and the simultaneous turns make you feel like you haven't played as long as you have.

Hmmm...I have played this "Grail game" once and, while I enjoyed it, I'm not sure it's worth the huge time investment, primarily because I am concerned about diversity of strategy. I like there to be more than one way to win a game and I just didn't see how monument-building could be a viable strategy unless your opponent is asleep. No, this one is a race to the stock exchange, however with a plethora of deep and far-reaching decisions along the way, no real limit to replayability with differing maps, and direct player interaction, it's certainly worth another look.

Epic.  Long.  Original.  Fiddly.  I want to like it, but it's just more work than fun.  This game is very pure, with close to zero randomness (mines are the only type I can think of.)  Rewards logistics very well.  Game takes a few plays to get the hang of, and at several hours, that's a huge commitment.

RATING: 9
A 2 player game, using the first recommended setup in the scenario book takes about 4 hours after reading the rules. In this game you start with a few transportation meeples, and some starting resources. You build unaligned structures on the board, which can harvest new things or convert basic resources into complex resources. You must establish an efficient system, so that at the end of each round you can make bricks to place into the "wonder" that produces points each round. The resource conversion chain also can be worth a ton if you manage to get all the way up to making stock bonds.

Ilyen nehéz játékkal nem igen találkoztam euro-k között. Komoly és jó mechanikával rendelkezik, de valahogy kaotikusnak éreztük, annak ellenére, hogy a szabályok letisztultak Ezt lekövetni és tervezni nem gyerekjáték. Mégis, úgy vagyok vele, hogy ide nekem az oroszlánt is.:)(indonesia)

Kevés út vezet a győzelemhez, szám szerint kettő, ezért minden lépéshez igen komoly tervezést kell eszközölni, mert kieshetünk a játékból. Egyedi és különleges darab, örülök, hogy birtokomban van egy példány.

This is another awesome game by Splotter. There is a lot going on, there are many ways to do something wrong to yourself or to your opponents. I like this kind of brutalness in games.
The nastiness in this game is in the way you can claim or loose possesion of goods. Every turn some fields produce goods which is left for pick up. If you are first there to claim it is yours and conflicts are decided by turn order. You can only have as many goods as you can transport. So you must build vehicles and roads to get them to claim resources.
This is a game you can play, win or loose in may ways. I like the components. The mines, which can go deplete, are also very cool. They are presented by numbered pillars and their outcome is decided by drawing a chit out of a bag with the same number.
Great game! Hopefully we can play it quicker next time!

I am a little shocked at how large the box is, but completely stoked I have a copy.

Play is fairly heavy (at first), or at least the planning makes it feel that way; however, after my third run-through, it has an increasingly, intuitive play. 

The victor will be the one who can build and maintain a stock engine first and for the most continuous period of time.  Watch out because time in the game generally ends quicker than what you probably need.  For this reason its important to play as efficient as possible.

A lot of the decisions feel similar to Neuland but smoother and more polished and in some ways more forgiving.  Neuland is more like a Euroized Roads & Boats.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
My rating on this game started high, and is climbing as I come to understand it better. Roads and Boats is fascinating, a game that's hard to stop playing even when it's late and you know you'll have to finish up tomorrow anyway! This is an economic development game, very unstructured and loose. It is mostly about optimization and at times can feel like solitaire, but there are some vicious player interactions possible. I've learned to place my goose pasture well back of my borders!

My high rating is based almost solely on the game play. The components and artwork are perfectly adequate, but not especially impressive. The original plastic sheet cracked early on; fortunately we had already replaced it with a flexible vinyl sheet, which works a lot better.

Not bad, lots of decisions, but it is a game of intersecting exponential growth curves where an early false step rules you out of contention 4 hours later.  There is interaction, but if aggressive, it tends to be detrimental to both involved, and the response time is slow so hitting the leader (when you work out who it is) is hard - usually a good thing, but not really so here.  Lost Valley has a lot of the same stuff going on, but plays much faster and is more enjoyable for my tastes.

I bought this because it's supposed to be really good solo as well as with others.

Now played a second time really enjoy this despite not being very good.  I don't even get 50% of the top score so i must be bad.  I enjoy it though

This is a game which is regularly brought to my local games club by its owner (who is a fan of Splotter games), but which is almost never played - even at our once-a-month Sunday sessions which are generally devoted to longer games. But a 4p game of this did get played in July 2015, involving me, and I have to say that I enjoyed it quite a lot (or at least was rather intrigued by the game), probably a bit more so than the other Splotter games I have played (Antiquity, Indonesia, and one other involving manufacturing strange goods in space, whose name I can't remember). In essence it's really just another engine-building game of producing goods and converting them into other ones, but this one seemed to offer more scope for interesting play than many such games - in large part because players can usefully co-operate for large parts of the early game, and only later start competing with each other over the high-value goods. I also like the idea of how different each game can be due to how the map is set up, and the tension over whether or not to build stages of the "wonder", particularly early on.

It's entirely possible that I could get bored of this game if I played it a few more times, but I definitely liked what I saw in that one play.

Caveat: I only played one game, and that game was played with three players.

Tough call to rate this one a "4".

I like the idea: building structures to harvest resources, and building other structures to refine those resources into advanced goods, and then using roads and vehicles to set up lines of production between those harvesters and refiners.

But, as the game progresses, the hexes become too small for the number of resource chits, and the whole board becomes too visually cluttered. It's hard to tell, at a glance, what resources or resource produces are in a particular space.

Also, I can't help but feel that the game would have been just as interesting if the number of buildings and resources were three quarters as large.

Big sandbox pick-up-and-deliver game that places an overwhelming focus on optimizing the tactical choices of building your engine to work at peak efficiency rather than inter-player strategic decisions. Depending on the map, a game can easily turn into player v. game rather than player v. player. There seems like there's a potentially great strategic game in there, there's just an incredibly steep learning curve for the tactics of building the engine to become second nature so that players can focus on engaging the other players. 

That being said, it's a fascinating game that I find very enjoyable.

R&B! When people say R&B, I get really excited...as if they could be talking about this one! But my brain doesn't really acknowledge any other R&B. I listen to melancholy folk singers like Beck, Hayden & Gillian Welch, I don't know this 'R&B' you speak of.

My R&B, however, is the greatest logistical nightmare ever designed! Love love love that I can play it solo, endlessly perfecting layers of connections upon connections and connections, this to make that to make this. A world of tremendous depth.

Doesn't hit you upfront with complexity, each bit is understandable, it's just that there's a lot of bits here, and they all need each other...which is why this is much more accessible than Antiquity, IMO.

Heavy game about planning, thinking ahead and trying to take advantage of what others have built.  It is about to construct a production machine and a transportation network that provides it with the goods that it needs to keep working and score points.

Just one play and it took 4.5 hours with three players. That is one downside to the game - time:enjoyability ratio is not great. However, I very much liked the concept and the mechanics were mind-bending to optimise your position. Easy to miss things though. Initially kept confusing Production and Building for some reason! 
However, having heard that a new version may be published I would hope and expect much better components. The acrylic overlay is impractical, there needs to be a road 'piece' like all other items.
Potentially an excellent game if the aesthetics are sorted.

Civ. I think this might be the logistics game to end all logistics games. I like it, in the same way I like Civ on the computer, but also prone to realizing at some point that I'm becoming subconsciously frustrated that my network and moves are sub-optimal. Also, the scenario we started with, it is possible to destroy your game in the first few moves if you don't know the order you need to build some things; I wonder if all games/scenarios are prone to self-destruction like that or not.

I simply cannot wrap my head around how this game is supposed to work. I played with a couple guys who think it's amazing, but I can't keep track of things, and every time I thought I had a strategy it would all come toppling down at the first hint of interaction with other players.

A very long game, but definitely one of my favourites. How could I not love a game about logistics? So far I've only played with 3 players. With the &etc expansion it can play up to 6 (if I could ever find 5 other people with enough time).
Edit: I have now played with 6 and it was a lot longer, but still a lot of fun.  I have to make sure everyone commits to playing to the end though, because if even one person leaves, it pretty much wrecks the game for everyone else.

This game is undeniably the ultimate pick up & deliver game, unfortunately this game is the ultimate pick up & deliver game.  Great design, nice balance, beautiful tiles, tons of bits, fun donkeys.  There are a lot of great things here, nice opportunities to screw each other or help each other.  Many divergent paths.   But the fact of the matter is that the game is just too long for what it is.  I could handle a two hour game of Roads and Boats, frankly, (keep in mind I like many 18 hour games) this game really wears out its welcome, by hour three.  This is a game of efficiancy, and mechanical deliberation, it is fun to watch it play out the way you observe crystals growing, but the game itself isn't overly engaging.  The only interaction that there is is taking what others have planned to use and the cool Wonder building.  But the Wonder is also the turn system, which means if no one is building it, then the game is going that much longer.  Still, though it is undeniably the grail of its class, just not worth the time for me.  I'd play again, if we started with some buildings on the board or had an quicker objective.  Update: Play Lost Valley instead, it has everything that this game offers in 1/3rd the playing time within a more exiting constraint.

You start with three donkeys and a couple of geese. The donkeys take logs from the woodcutter to the saw mill to make boards that are used to make quarrys to produce stone for roads and walls and other buildings like paper mills that produce paper and that can be mixed with geese and used as research to build trucks and steamboats and such, and coal burners to produce fuel and to build mines that produce iron and gold that go toward a mint to make coins which can be combined with paper in the stock exchange to make stock and you can sail down the river in your raft and build bricks for the wonder and...

Really need to try this with the full complement of players, but found it to only be somewhat interesting and not super-juicy. Hopefully the player interaction with others will bring out some tension and interaction that would make it more fun.

UPDATE: With an actual set of players, rather than solo, the game is an engrossing constantly engaging delight to play. There is plenty of tension in trying to eke out a bit of efficiency as well as leverage the hard work of other players.

Played the game again after more than 2 years from the first time and maybe because times have changed or maybe because I like other kind of game now, I didn't become a huge fan of R&B. Played a 3 player game using a non conflict map. Two players went for the wonder from the very beginning of the game while the third player, which was I went for the stocks. One single stock was more than enough to win the game by a large margin. But the main thing here was that the game was very, very, boring. I won it, I did my thing, everything went right but it was boring to death. Fiddlyness remains like a brand logo mark from Splotter and frankly I'm starting to question this kind of game organization. I like complicated games but this kind of "dirt" in the board is starting to annoy me more than pleasing me. Indonesia and Antiquity have the exact same problem and I can't find a solution if the game doesn't reveal a strong appeal, and R&B clearly didn't.

I will play it again for sure in the future but at least I have to find a more dynamic and conflictual map.

Magnificent game!  I love planning the logistics of how to place my buildings, and how to keep others from poaching.  

We do play with a house rule, though: wonder bricks in player colors DO contribute VPs, but do NOT count toward the clock.  The game ends after a predetermined number of white bricks (roughly 26-33 depending how long a game you want) have been placed in the Wonder, regardless of how many player bricks have been used.  If the wonder is filled up, no more player bricks may be added, but keep adding one white brick per turn above the wonder until the game ends.

Heavy logistics/terrain development game.

+ Simple rules - Very easy to start playing
+ Deep - You have to make future strategic planning, but also fine tune each turns tactics.
+ Interactive - Everything you develop can benefit all players. Walls can be used to deny access to various resources.


- Component quality - Dreadful artwork, a kid could make better. Wooden components could be a lot better. Tiles should be double faced, also with better artwork.
- Long - Too much time investment needed for a session that doesn't return the expected fun.
- Insanely Expensive - Bought at Essen at 70Euros. That's a ripoff! Only game i really wanted that much and actually bought at such high price. Shouldn't cost more than 30Euros with such components.
- Fiddly - Sometimes a tile can accumulate too many tranpsorters/goods that it becomes annoying.

Very dry.  Seems like a game that might get better with more plays, as one big mistake early in this 4-5 hour game can ruin the next 4 hours.  Therefore, the first game is strictly for learning.  I guess I need to put in a second game to truly rate it, but I am only so-so on playing again.  The game wes really dry and really long.  Bad combo.  Another player's turn can take forever with all the little bits, which drives me nuts.  It seems like there are several games that do this sort of thing better in less time.  It could be enjoyable, but I think I'd it'd have to be competitive, and I'm probably not willing to put in the time for that with this particular game.  It's just missing something to make it fun enough to put in the hours.

I wouldn't mind owning this, but four things could make it the perfect PBEM game: (1) lack of experienced players to devote four hours at a time, (2) prohibitive retail price, (3) multi-player solitaire aspect, (4) no random elements.

Oh, and did I mention it's fun? Admittedly, there's not alot of player interaction, but it's interesting creating an efficient machine and watching it run. I don't know how often I'll play this F2F, but for a PBEM exercise, I recommend it.

I was introduced to this game about 15 years ago when it first came out, and it was a major flop for us. But now, I find Roads & Boats (4th edition) to be endlessly fascinating - truly a unique landmark design for the ages (a logistics optimization masterpiece). 

There is so much to explore here. If you aren't looking for confrontation, it plays excellent solitaire. If you are looking for confrontation, there are some really nasty plays that can be made against an opponent. If you're looking for friendly cooperative play, that's here too.

The game does take a while to setup and play, but it is so worth it. Rarely has gameplay so fully captivated me!

Replabyability is off the charts - I doubt that I'll ever tire of this game.

Splotter Spellen has become one of my favorite companies, and I'm including this wonderful game at the top of  their best list - really great stuff!

RATING: 5
Played once solitaire and once with four.  Certainly enjoyable, but I agree with another comment that it feels a bit like a computer game - but the decision tree is more limited than computer Civ games.  So, it comes down to how much you enjoy moving all the pieces around.  Some of us did... others didn't as much.  So, that makes the length a negative - would probably rather get two games in of something else over one of this one.  Would like to try with 2 or 3, and would like to try different map - but how often is this really going to get pulled out?

I probably give this game an 8 as a game to own, with the bonus two points being that the solitaire option is avialable.  Nice to have a solataire game.

UPDATE:  Down a point after getting Agricola which is my 1 player game of choice now.

RATING: 8
Impressive and unforgiving logistics game. Play revolves around the use of natural resources, such as wood, clay and gold, and the ability to use these resources for development purposes. Wood and clay are used for construction purposes, gold is used to create money and so on. All resources have to be transported from their areas of origin in order to be used and this is initially done with donkeys, but as the game progresses and as a player develops their modes of transport, wagons and trucks can be used. The important thing to remember when playing 'R&B' is that all resources and buildings are public property and can therefore be used by any player (there is nothing more frustrating than taking several turns to construct a mine and for another player to come along and cease all the gold). It is therefore really important to track how much movement your opponents are capable of and to make best use of the transportation networks yourself. Like all 'Splotter Spellen' games I have played, this is a deeply strategic and challenging game, one that rewards shrewd decision making and opportunism. It is by far one of the heavier 'pick up and deliver' games out there and is well worth investing in the time needed to play.

Logistics! This game is actually about logistics. Not the simulated kind where you need to buy another locomotive to move goods longer. But the kind where there are actual transporters, moving actual goods, over actual terrain. There's too many goods here, but too few over there, and none of the transporters are where they should be. A brain burner, and a beautiful one at that.

Now here's a classic that gets lots of praise but that not that many people own. Because it's from a niche publisher, because it's expensive and/or because it doesn't have great art or components.
Let's start with the components. Why do we have to use crayons? Include some wooden sticks, will ya? Much nicer and practical. Why is the sheet to draw on not flat and too small to cover the game board? Why are the goods tokens so tiny and fiddly? Colored cubes would be so much more practical! Why are the research beads too big/the research board too small? This is the 4th edition, it should have been put together better by this version, I would think. The iconography could also have been clearer. And while artwork is a matter of taste, the artwork in this game can hardly be said to be of a professional level.
But a game is about more than just nice art, components and production values of course. The game mechanisms are of greater importance to most, and that is not different for me. I can live with mediocre art and components if the game is good.
Now this game is hard to judge from one play, but that is why I'm writing about first impressions, not final reviews. This game with 3 new players took a bit more than 2 hours, which is acceptable for this kind of game as it does offer a good amount of depth. In fact, this first game was a learning game. Only by the very end of the game, we started getting an idea of how to play the game to good effect. We all tried different stuff to different degrees of success. One player started by growing donkeys to maximize mobility. An other maximized resource generation. I didn't max anything, my engine didn't work all that well. And yet I was the first player to create mint, which won me the game. Only we didn't recognize this fact until very late in the game. I did it because it seemed like a good idea, something I could do while the others cranked up their well oiled engines even further.
The game felt quite slow, ramp up was slow, and most things you want to do take a lot of time to accomplish. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but I think this game is starting to show it's age. It's just not as well polished, as well developed as some of today's deepest, heaviest games. Games have come a long way in the past 15 years and while this game might have been revolutionary when it came out (I don't know, I wasn't about to get into gaming for 6 more years) but I'm quite certain it has been surpassed by today's fantastic games.
Now I do want to play this again to explore it some more, but I don't expect to love this game ever.

It's probably the least traditionally "fun" game I've played, but it's enjoyable on an intellectual exercise and I think an exquisite example of genius in board game form.

However, I feel like I need to come up for air after bearing the weight of this thing on my chest.

As excellently designed as this game is, my real question is: how many times do I actually want to play it? It is, by a large margin, the most mentally taxing game I have ever played. Minute-for-minute, no game comes close to requiring the mental stamina necessary to play this game. The cognitive load is incredible, truly a mental marathon. 

I have a tremendous amount of respect for this game, and I stand in awe of people who can bear to play this beast more than once or twice a year.

It's one of the few games I know I will be playing for many years to come--and as a result, it is  the only game that I have spent more money upgrading than on the original game itself.

Bumped up my rating. Every so often I get a strong itch to play this game.

Between the maps that give more solitaire play and those that have you fighting for resources, I like ones where you fight for resources a little. But some of those also put a few deserts close to your starting location, which slows development down. It should be noted that the map you play greatly influences how the game plays. If you think the game play is too solitare, you can choose a map that isn't.

03 DEC 2010 - Borrowed my friend's copy, learned the rules, wrote a rules summary, and got in 3 games of it. Loved it every time. Now I need my own copy. I love how open the system is and yet, how tight it is as well due to the landscape. Ultimate game will be to play the tiles as the opening round then fight over the best spots.

RATING: 6
In a lot of ways, this is a bit like multi-player solitaire. It is an engine game and for a good portion of the game, you probably aren't interacting with the other players. This means that whomever is most efficient in using the resources around them likely has an advantage. Being able to use your neighbors resources (whether their excess raw materials or their secondary producers) makes you much more efficient.

If you don't like engine building games, or long games, you should pass.

** Update - after playing it some more online, I ended up selling my copy. The game is just too long for what you get out of it. There are other, more fun games that scratch a similar itch for me (engine building, turn things into other thing games blossomed a good amount since this came out). If this was at most a two hour game, it'd have a higher score, but 4+ hours for 3-4 people is too long for what you get.

For some reason, managing all of those little resources is a total blast to me.  I love the theme (seeing those little donkeys trudging around with supplies on their backs just makes me smile).  You can play aggressively, raiding each other's territory.  You can play defensively, walling yourself in.  You can play cooperatively, sharing resources and factories.  You can even play it solitarily if you want.  Spectacular game!  I have downgraded this from a perfect 10, since the last couple of times someone has mentioned it, I wasn't really that into playing.  I think my tastes are slowly but surely shifting to shorter games, probably as a result of having kids.

RATING: 9
Extremely impressive design.  It's a resource management / logistics game with zero luck and no hidden information.  It provides the players with a great deal of flexibility in terms of both long-term strategy and short-term tactics.  The decisions can be absolutely mind-melting once you and your competitors evolve past the more predictable donkey transporters.  There's also a nice potential for escalating tension since the players speed up the game clock as they claw at the VP awarded for contributing to the completion of the collaborative wonder (which ends the game).

One problem with the game (but one that's probably unavoidable, considering the numerous streams of resources) is that it's very fiddly with the piles of tiny counters that are moving all over the place.  It can become quite confusing when you're moving goods and transporters around if you change your mind and try to rewind your actions.  Also, the theme could be implemented a little better (geese?), but now I'm just nitpicking.  Roads & Boats isn't meant to be a narrative game or a simulation.  It's a true-blue strategy game, and it excels at that.  This is now my heavy Euro of choice (good thing I know someone who owns it, 'cause that's a big box with a bigger price tag).

Weird one, this.  Probably a bit too much granularity in choice of buildings, transport etc.  Didn't feel entirely clear what we were supposed to be doing.  Buildings are built by an individual but communally available to all - are we competing or cooperating? Small points for building a "Wonder", massive points for owning the one or two shares that might occur in a game - shares in *what* exactly? It's a robust system but could probably do with some simplification and a more specific theme so there's a sense of what it is we're actually trying to do.

This was pretty cool--though it has the major downside of having to move around a ton of little bits each turn.

Roads and Boats is a game that I knew little about except that it was a Splotter Spellen game.  I don't always love Splotter games (Antiquity comes to mind) and for some reason I thought this was more of a "train"
 route building and delivery type game that I wouldn't care for.  It's actually much more of a resource management and building game that's more up my alley.

There's a lot of different potential setups for the game, but we played a standard starting one.  The game has a lot of resource chains where you build buildings to get raw goods, buildings to convert raw goods into production materials, and buildings that produce transportation, and finally buildings that produce money and stock certificates (which are the way to score big points). The main strategy seems to be that you build up your infrastructure to the point where you can bring in enough raw goods, convert them and generate the big ticket point items (coins and stock certificates).  

I say seems to be because that never happened in our game.  Instead our game focused on the other way to score points, building the monument.  Each round, players can contribute to building the monument, which costs one good in the early game and two in the late game.  Then a neutral player builds as well.  Each row in the monument is worth 10 points.  In the early game the rows are smaller, but they get wider in the late game (requiring more bricks to complete each row).  The 10 points are divided between all players who contributed to each row (in the ratio of how many of the player bricks were theirs).  

Our game ended up being a monument rush.  So we never developed a mine and barely advanced to the point where people built wagons.  I feel like I misded a lot of this game due to this weird rush.  I really want to play it again and actually develop my civilization more.

Awesome game. Such a perfect fulfillment of everything that is cool about pick up and deliver  & efficiency games. A game I would be happy to play enough to master it, and then keep on playing it because it feels to fun. The fact that the solitaire version is engaging and replayable only adds to the obsession. Yet when playing with others you realize how much is there for interaction and terribly mean moves.

Logistics game that has a lot of puzzle solving aspects to it. All about figuring out the optimal way of moving goods. I like this one. Would rate higher if it didnt take so long ! A 6 rating is "will play sporadically if in the right mood", and play time is the limiting factor on my rating.

What a cool game! The whole idea of it really works and the bits are fantastic, the hexagonal board-build provides unlimited re-playability. Being in control of the evolution from the start makes you feel very God-like while playing this game. It's long and BIG but I'd love to play a lot more of it.

This is heavy working; a logistic nightmare! But it was a fun challenge, even though hard to get on the table due to its extreme call for AP. Too. Much. Time.
Bottomline: I sold it.
I'll miss this one but would much prefer "Roads & Boats Light", playable within 90 minutes and without umpteen different chits. Lowered my rating accordingly to a 7.

Yikes!  Neat game.  I have only scratched the surface on this one.  This could take some time to get good at.  Played solitaire puzzle first.  Did pretty poorly the first time.  Doubled my score the second time.  Played 4 more solo games.  Changed rating from 8 to a 9.  I think about this when I go to sleep.

RATING: 7.9
One play in, and eager for more. Despite the millions of chits, doesn't have the fiddliness that some games manage with even one tenth of the pieces. Perhaps because the moving of bits isn't secondary to the game -- it *is* the game.

RATING: 8
My god, this game is a beast in the better sense of the word! It follows a very logical flow of network building, but because of the simultaneous actions, it often feels more like a puzzle than a game. I like that the players determine the amount of interaction they want. There is almost no luck (save for mine production), so the more experienced player definitely has the advantage. The only thing holding this game back is the long play time (2.5 hours if all agree not to think too hard, but 4 hours is more realistic). This prevents its regular appearance at game nights, but the solitaire scenarios somewhat fill in the gap. I like this game quite a bit, and am glad to own it, even if the box is ridiculously large!

RATING: 8
A game about logistics?  Doesn't sound so interesting, but it is.  The idea that resources are completely public is a really fascinating way to model the complex economic relationships between geography, investment, and demand.  I've never seen any other mechanic that is anywhere near as subtle and as simple as that system.  That said, the game is complex and fiddly, which doesn't particularly bother me, but does mean that the first play will be a rather obtuse one.  Different maps keep this one replayable.  Definitely a game I like.

RATING: 8
(After one 4p game) Not as difficult to understand game play as I feared.  Now execution - that's another story.  There are a lot of moments after the game where you see inefficiencies, but that's make you want to play it more.  Our game went very quickly because mining wa tough to get going and we had an abundance of boards which turned the wonder track into a sprint when the second person joined the race.  Looking forward to a chance to play again somewhat soon.

RATING: 9
Although I have trouble getting it on the table, I absolutely love this game.  I would rate it a 10, but it does have too many bits.  I don't find it fiddly as many do, since it does simulate a very deep mini economy.  Also it has a really steep learning curve.

The thing about this game is that you need to be able to come up with your endgame plan as soon as you start, since the whole "I'll make one of these and see what I can do with it when it's built" plan isn't going to work.  Given that my way of learning games is to play around with different things and see how they work, my approach was pretty useless here.  I do like the game (it's probably the most intuitive of all Splotter games), and the depth of the game versus its play time is fairly reasonable, so I guess it's just a matter of carving out the time and opportunity to play it multiple times.

Fiddly as hell, takes all night to play, fairly ropey components but probably the most addictive and satisfying game i own. Its essentially a 'sandbox' game. Here is a world, a set of tools, its up to the players what is created.

I've played several times in groups of 3 to 5 people. I find that even with mostly simultaneous movement there can be a lot of downtime. And in my experience the game doesn't last long enough to build much beyond the basic buildings. If you try to do so then players who concentrate on building the wonder will force the game to end before you can put said buildings to good use. So overall, while the game can be fun, it is not one of my favorites.

This is an A1 game. Managing transport systems hoping to make sure they are in the right place at the right time with the right goods on board. It is a little fiddly but once you start playing it is smooth. Very little downtime, so many different things to do and you can either play nasty or nice.

There is almost zero downtime in this game. Your brain is always working, trying to figure out the best way to actualise your strategy. 

I know some people won't like pick up and deliver, but then they always knew this wasn't for them. If you don't mind the mechanism, this is an amazing game full of depth.

I made the mistake of taking the name of this game to mean it's simple and not very sophisticated.  Let me tell you that simple and unsophisticated couldn't be farther from the truth for this title.  The core player actions aren't difficult, but there seems to be so many options that it's difficult to formulate a solid strategy.  Additionally while contention doesn't appear to be a main mechanic, it's actually a very potent aspect of the game.  The nature of unowned resources and controlled player order adds a lot of strategy to an already tricky title.  A fun game, but a very epic game at that.

RATING: 5
This is a game of resource management. I find it dry and needing a kick in the pants myself, but it does have some perfection in it. From the beginning you know what you need to do to win and you know the chart for advancement, but there's no life in it for me. Just business decisions on transportation and what to build. I dont wanna revisit work at home for pete's sake.  I think I'd like antiquity from the same company though. it might just have a better theme.

Played a few times (with 3 or 4 players). An impressive game with interesting ideas, lots of tiny bits to move and pile (typical Splotter), and a tough learning curve.

If I was still in school taking a class in Operations Research and wanted to solve scheduling problems I would be eating this up (at least until solved), but it is too "by the textbook" for my tastes nowadays (once you work out the models the game plays itself). 

Perhaps its because its so easy to get caught up and distracted by the optimization exercise and get blind sided by another player playing resource raider. The two elements don't feel like they belong together, but to remove the raiding leaves too much of an only multiplayer solitaire game. I'm sure the answer is more  heuristic playing to make it more instinctive, but then all you would be left with is raiding which isn't worth the complexity is it?

I try not to use fractions when rating games, but I'm not sure what this game deserves after playing one 2-player game.

It was fun, for sure, and I like the bits, but it was long and once you get into it it gets fiddly.  The begining can move along pretty well, but once you get 7-8 transporters with a huge amount of producers to go to it can slow down a bit.

That said, I reiterate; I like it.  Scott said that Antiquity eliminates a lot of the fiddlyness and is shorter, so I am waiting for a third printing of.  Antiquity is popular enough that I think Splotter will print another run of it.  They made 3 runs of R&B, and Antiquity sold out of 2 runs in the span of 4 years, averaging 2 years a run.  Another run is economically justified.

One of the worst game experiences I've ever had. Combines many of my least favorite elements into a single game -- Efficiency Optimization, Multiple Resource Streams, Interwoven Tech Trees, Pick Up & Delivery, emphasis on Long-Term over Short-Term planning... all wrapped up into an incredibly long game with arduous amounts of downtime. My decisions and turns went very quickly, and even with simultaneous play, I found myself waiting 5, 10, up to 15 minutes to get back into the action as other players resolved conflicts. I don't think this game could ever be fun for me.

Yes it is extremely fiddly.  Yes it plays awfully long.  Yes sometimes you have to wait for other people to finish their turn even with the simultaneous nature of each phase.  However, the game is still enjoyable for me without feeling like work.  I doubt it would be something I'd choose to play very often (and thus have no need of owning a copy), but with so many scenarios available, I'm glad to know that each experience will be different than the previous ones.

My only concern is that because Roads and Boats is the epitome of efficiency, with everything being equal, the game is very unforgiving if you make a mistake (misuse a land, forget to produce, or have your goods stolen).  There is pretty much no catch up mechanism unless everyone agree to screw the leader somehow; and even then sometimes it's already too late.

A really meaty and fulfilling title but also flawed.  Deceptively confrontational unless all participants decide to play solitaire-like.

Rules are relatively simple, but game has tons of opportunity for planning.  Other than initial tile placement, the lack of nearly any random factors (other than some mines) makes this an excellent game for lovers of heavy Euro economic games.  It is a bit hard to catch up once you fall behind though.

Recently I'm playing with my local rule in which only production is simultaneous and then every player has his own player turn.  So that everyone can think his movement, construction and wonder consistently.  This reduces playtime and load to the brain.  Now, I upgraded my rating from 7 to 10.

RATING: 6
Route building (and blocking) combined with a race to pick up VP-scoring stuff.  It's nicely themed to include space walks and aliens (little green cubes). Quite likeable, but ultimately too much seems to depend on random tile draws.

Production quality and artwork are decent.  The rules are fine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Again a game with very good idea, but weak implementation. Usually there's no use in starting to move before all routes are built, and that means the player who gets most lucky tiles wins..

This is an interesting little 2 player, tile laying race game. It takes a game (or 2) to get the flow of the game in terms of moving your pieces along the tube, but it's worth it. I just don't have an opponent for this one (too deep for my GF I'm afraid). So, make me a deal on this hard to find 2 player, you should like it.

There's a lot more depth to Tom Tube than I have been able to plumb thus far. It combines a connection game with resource management. The resources are worth various numbers of victory points, but all (except the solar counters) are useful for other in-game actions.

Ehhh, it's an ok game, just not all that fun.  I don't really feel like an astronaut in space, just a guy placing tiles and moving wooden pieces around.

A neat brainteaser. Though I do find Kahuna, Chess or Abalone (just to name other tactical two-player games right off my head) more exciting. After all, there are few sudden surprises one tends to see in those. That said, I do like to bring it to the table whenever waiting for a larger group to form. 

I think it has more staying power than Lost Valley and Cronenberg, though of course Lost Valley has the nice adventure touch.

Neat and interesting but perhaps a little difficult to approach for the weight and brevity of the game.  Only four plays so far and while the depth of the game is starting to become apparent, how to play effectively and use that depth to make an interesting game is only barely starting to become apparent.  Currently there's a lot of happenstance, "Hey, I can do this clever thing!" going on.

Oops!  Increased rating a full point after realizing that we had been playing a key rule wrong- you can only move to/through _complete_ spheres.  This actually fixed most of my complaints with the game.  This is a neat, unique little game that is every bit as good as the Kosmos 2 player line, and better than many of them.  I love the space theme, the vague Bowie/2001 allusions, and the visual appeal of the game.  Clever, somewhat experimental mechanics that largely work and provide for an interesting contest.  Boulder Games regularly stocks it in the US.  Recommended!

RATING: 8
A very good two player game. However I am biased towards any game where I get to build things. I like railroad games and building the connecting tubes is a great fit for me. The game is very fun and has tons of opportunities for playing to enhance your position or slow down your opponent. Lots of fun depth of 4 out of 10

RATING: 5
Yeow. I had such high hopes for this one, and it is always a nasty surprise to find out that they won't be fulfilled. It looks such a nice concept: laying down tiles, moving the astronauts along the pipes, collecting points along the way. For one thing, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of incentive to pick up green cubes. They cost two yellows to pick up, effectively giving you just a blue cube, or 5 points. That's not a lot considering the effort which goes into their generation. The travelling rules make it genuinely hard to float through longer stretches of tube: there's just too many sharp bends in the pattern. With luck, you can make about two or three 'highways'&mdash;mostly because your opponent knows that he needs to block you. The game grinds to a slow, boring point-2-point movement fest which doesn't resemble the elegance of the rules at all.

Now, to be honest, we haven't yet begun jumping around which can avoid nasty obstructions. We haven't played that many games, so our strategies are likely to be off. But at the same time I get the nagging feeling that there genuinely isn't that much in this game—at least not the amount I had originally envisaged. Either way, my sweetheart wasn't too keen on playing this anymore, so I sold it off.

Components: Beautiful game; the tiles are linen-coated and the colors look as bright in person as they do on the box cover.

Experience: Half the game is spent building efficient routes; the other half racing around, scooping up energy cubes and trying to get the solar panels.  There really isn't enough time to go too far out of one's way for an alien counter.  There are a few opportunities to block one's opponent, but for the most part we're just each doing our own thing.

This game hurts my brain. It's extremely challenging to get a single good drift lined up and you need to be planning several at a time. It would have been nice if they'd put some effort into the theme. Probably a good game for a pair that enjoys a good brain-burner, but not really my cup of tea.

Intriguing game that will leave you with the feeling that you are wandering your way around in the dark until you realize there are patterns you need to  to get from A to B quickly.  Far superior to the other rhomb-inspired games I played.

RATING: 6
I'm not entirely sure what to make of this. I quite like the setting, and the game's premise sounds fairly promising as well: Build paths while obstructing your opponent's and race to collect your gadgetry first. It sort of delivers during the tile placement phase, giving you lots of things to think about and not making it too easy to get what you want, but falls a little short on movement when you realize that it is very slow going because drifts are typically very short (unless you manage to build an expressway that is a) dependent on your tile draws and b) easily sabotaged).

Surprisingly deep and heavy for its look or playing time. You draw a tile and you have so much to consider while laying it that it can be really tough to make it quick. Analysis paralysis pure!

And that's my gripe - to much to think for a filler but to shallow for a heavy game. Something in-between.

But when you finish playing the board looks just astonishing! Worth seeing.

Not sure what to make out of it - it left me rather cold. Acceptable abstract (although not as good as it could be with some little changes - I really dislike how slow the movement is because you have to stop at each yellow cube. Why not allow players to jump these? The alien cube system is also lame - spend two points (and turns) to get five. Huh?) The theme is terribly pasted on. Not much desire to play again.

This is another game simple in rules, but has many different ways it can be played.  The game initially appears to be a passive race-like game.  Indeed, that's pretty much how it's billed.  Underlying these are many possibilities to make the game a little more surprising.  You can block, either with your astronaut or with the pieces.  You can send your opponent off into the cosmos if you get the right tiles.  There are many strategies that aren't immediately evident.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Plays quickly and the rules are easy to understand and consistent.  The hard part is setting up paths that you can follow in a small number of moves, and to some extent you're dependent on luck of the draw for the right pieces.  Even so, the game does have a nice strategic feel to it and the time to play is just right.  (And it is very nice to look at...)

Two player tile laying game that also involves racing as you seek to lay tubes to your solar cylinders first.  In the meantime, decisions about picking up extra energy and other cubes which provide special moves or points if kept in reserve also exist.

Zwei Astronauten erweitern ihre Raumstation und verbinden die Teile mit Röhren, durch die sie schweben und die wichtigen Energie- und Kontrollsteine transportieren, um damit Raumsprünge und schnellere Bewegungen zu ermöglichen. Auch der Kontakt mit Außerirdischen ist möglich. Das geschieht, indem durch das Legen von Rauten und Dreiecken das Röhrensystem erweitert wird. Das Spiel endet, wenn ein Spieler zwei Solarsteine in seine Basis bringt oder keine Raute mehr gelegt werden kann. Wessen gesammelte Steine den höchsten Wert haben, hat das Spiel gewonnen.

A very interesting 2-player game.  The game does have a theme, but it is still really just an abstract game.  This is mostly a tile laying game, but the vast majority of the tiles are really difficult to use to your advantage, and because of that the game does take some thought to play.  I find the game board and components very attractive, and I often like just looking at the board after my opponent and I finish a game.

I really enjoyed this.  The set-up and rules are relatively simple, although the rulebook is a little obtuse in places.  Once you get past this, you have a reasonably fast game with a lot of decisions to be made each turn.  You can build offensively or defensively, you can move to get cubes, the collectors or to block your opponent. Lots of elements in a nicely balanced package.

This is a lovely little tactical connection/racing game.  Moving your little "astronaut" around takes the edge off of how abstract it really is.  There are lots of little things to do, many worthwhile things to collect, and yet you have to balance everything between moving and laying track.  Lots of great little decisions, as every choice is the difference between bolstering up and being efficient (with a minor amount of screwage). Tiles draws can be frustrating, but this game is all about making due.

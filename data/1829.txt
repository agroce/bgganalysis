Ameritrash dicefest.  There were some strategic elements to it I suppose, but also a lot of screw-the-leader. There is a lot of variability in the power of the action cards, which can be annoying.

RATING: 4
It's basically Risk with nukes and the moon as a new "continent". Somehow this doesn't add up to a better game and if I am going to sit down to play Risk (which doesn't happen much anymore), it will still most likely be to the base game over this.

Much better than standard Risk. Five rounds make it a much shorter playing time and all the other elements (commanders, power cards, sea and moon terrain) make the game more interesting than Risk.

For Trade
Condition is Good.

Big improvement on Risk:  Hidden turn order bidding (like in Ikusa), Australia is not isolated, ocean and moon colonies, and the game ends after 5 rounds.

RATING: 6
Good variant of RISK.  I appreciate the 5 turn limit.  The cards are cool.  Theme is good.  Nukes are cool.  Has a small kingmaking problem (on the last turn), though, from what I've seen. (people who see that they don't have the points to win have to decide who to attack) Maybe a bit too much going on for what is, ultimatley, a RISK variant. I also feel like there's too many territories (you have to spread yourself pretty thin most of the time).

Risk is the most complex game that my friends are willing to play, so I started there as many others and like the idea of a deeper version of traditional risk while being able to play the normal version as well with this game. The new elements add nicely to the gameplay but I prefer to play a mixture of the american rules and the secret-mission-based rules of the german versions.

Edit:I have just lowered the rating. I had the big box edition, but lent it to a friend and never got it back. My secret Santa thoughtfully got me a replacement having read this,  which was really touching.:) Unfortunately the quality of the components  of the small box has taken a shocking dive.

The moon is flimsy and printed on one side, of cornflake box material. The energy tokens likewise are crappy and printed on one side. Cards and main board and plastic bits are fine. Internal space hull decoration gone.

So sad. The flimsy components will need to be treated with great care, but the one sided tokens are just ugly.



For me the best version of Risk, although I haven't played the Star Wars versions.

RATING: 7
Very unattractive board with nice pieces. I am fairly certain this version of risk offers less strategic value as far as game play goes, than the original.  Future versions of risk would be greatly served by increasing the depth of strategy regarding area control rather than giving us a purely lateral expansion with moons and water cities.  The leader and leader cards element adds more to the game but it doesn't seem to add more strategy. I detect a corporate meddling in the games conception/implementation.  Having said that its still fun to play, but modern iterations of Risk could challenge their audience more as this territory has already been cultivated, harvested, slashed n' burned, fallowed but ultimately abandoned, nuked and finally terraformed and re-implemented for completely different purposes.

RATING: 9
A superior version of risk. You can play the original on this board, or play by the 2210 rules, which adds undersea and lunar territories. 2210 is played in 5 turns. Yes, 5. World domination is possible in that short time too. I've done it in 4.

If you must play RISK, play this version, as it fixes problems with the base game: holding Australia isn't an auto-victory, lots of scope to collect sets of geographic areas, and a fixed time limit.

This game manages to fix many of the old problems with Risk (such as the preeminence of Australia), while still remaining true to the spirit and strategy of Risk in a changed environment. Much better at recapturing the feeling and strategy of Risk than the Lord of the Rings Risk.

This was the game that turned me into a boardgame freak (and/or geek).  I thought I had lost original Risk after moving house, and so I got this, with its little BattleMech-style units, the commanders, and the cards.  And, as someone else mentions in the comments here, you can nuke the Moon.  It was a step up from the original game in complexity and excitement (5 turns to do as much damage as possible!), and led me to consider other, more complex boardgames out there..

A bit too long, but very tense and exciting game. The luck factor feels to be too high sometimes and it seems that there  is some broken strategies (namely the "moon strategy"). Also, it's too important to be last to move on final round.

I'll put it this way: when the dice are in my favor, I'm having fun; when they're not, I hate this game.  Actually, for the amount of dice rolling that Risk contains, it drags on for far too long.  Checking tables constantly, buying really lame commander cards, and watching my army get decimated because I had a string of bad luck is frustrating and will eventually put me to sleep.  I remember having fun with this game a few years ago, but now I think I really need to try Vinci.

Risk is an ok game and 2210 is an ok variation.  I'm not a fan of games that can last forever (like Risk) but I also don't like games that cut you off at a certain turn (Like 2210)  Other than that the new mechanics make the game a little less bland and you can play longer if you like but the new mechanics seem to make the game go much longer if you play to last man standing like in basic Risk.

I, unlike many fellow geeks on this board, actually enjoyed the classic Risk a lot some years before. Not having many other options where I live, it was *the* strategy game. Of course, I eventually became tired of it's lack of strategy, but this new Risk has a lot of new options and a functional time limit that makes the game fun again, and I believe it will last for a lot of years to come.

UPDATE: It takes forever, and I'm frankly not that keen of backstabbing and loudmouthing people anymore. Down to a 6.

It's not getting enough plays from us. Last time I played, it took about 9 hours straight, 9:00pm-6:00am! Amazingly we didn't feel time go by: one of best Risk game I have EVER played, thanks to a great group of players and a good game! Very good game, but not always willing to pay because of length... How can I rate that? Between 6 and 8, so 7.

Fresh new version of the classic Risk. With a turn limit of 5, the game does no longer drag on for hours (or days), forcing eliminated player to float around doing nothing. In Risk 2210 A.D. it's almost impossible to get wiped out, instead you go for total points gathered in the end.
Commanders and attack/defense cards are new in this version, and freshens the game up by many levels.

The additional elements introduced in 2210 tremendously improved upon the Risk system.  Who doesn't like the new commanders and naval territories?

Significantly better than regular risk, Risk 2210 can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike. I enjoyed it better than Star Wars Risk, although it still suffers from the new Avalon Hill's substandard component quality. AH needs to take a look at what companies like Z-Man games and Days of Wonder is doing because the cardboard in their games is embarrassing. No double sides energy counters and thin cardboard all around except for the nice mounted map. Its like they are still producing game at 80s production quality. Despite the game is good. The cards look nice actually and I find the map pretty although not too functional- territory borders are hard to detect and so are lunar landing sites.

[i]Posted: 7/16/04, Rated: 8[/i]

The first re-themed version of [i][gameid=181][/i] that I have tried.  Introduces new layers of complexity including Commanders: super units that situationally allow you to roll d8's instead of d6's.  Space stations are earth-based structures that increase the defensive capabilities in a territory, allowing all defending units to roll d8's.

There are five commanders, and each has a corresponding deck of "Command Cards."  These cards allow for special powers and effects.  Commanders, stations, cards -- including their activation costs, and even turn order are all paid for with energy.  Energy is the equivalent of currency in the game.

[i]Risk 2210 A.D.[/i] also allows players to fight on the moon.  It can be invaded from space stations on Earth, provided that your Space Commander is already in play.  A convenient score card/turn indicator is included as a separate board.

Game duration is artificially managed by imposing a five turn limit.  The added depth of [i]Risk 2210 A.D.[/i] provides interesting decisions outside of the combat-only focus of the original game.  It is easily my favorive variant of [i][gameid=181][/i] that I have tried thus far.

2) I hate being able to be ousted from a multiplayer game in the opening round, or close to it.

3) Therefore, I hate Risk 2210.

More interesting than regular Risk, I love being able to roll with the 8-sided dice!  I especially like the limit to 5 turns which forces people to be aggressive and keeps the game from dragging too long.

A game I play this much I have to rank a 9. There's just something so accessible about this game. When you have established a few finicky things about the rules it's wholly unlike risk but with all the same exciting army building love. Play to the end (instead of the standard five rounds) and get ready for a long good night of gaming.

Dice fest, kingmaker, suicidal tendencies. It's all GREAT...to watch. I don't like luck filled games when I actually play them, but these types can be good spectator sports. I like this version much more than the original Risk. Nuclear command cards rock... Anything with nukes rocks.

RATING: 7
Warning!  If you play this game you will never want to play oldschool Risk ever again!  Playtime is about 3 hours including setup for experienced players.  The game is easy to play, but there are alot of strategic options.  Players will no longer be able to dig in like they did in Risk.  The new water territories really open up the board making it difficult to hole up.  Still lots of dice rolling though, and the drawing of command cards means that luck is still a huge factor.  Endgame is better, but not great.  Still one of my favorite games.

It's RISK, except the game doesn't go on forever (pre-determined to end in 5 turns).  The cards and fallout also make things far more interesting.  I would never choose to play the original RISK over this.  Unfortunately, suffers from "I would always bring Nexus Ops out before this" syndrome in my game group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love this game.  The cards make it a little chaotic, which I enjoy, but it doesn&#039;t totally refute strategy.  It&#039;s maybe 50% strategy, 25% luck (dice), 25% surprise (cards).  Die hard Risk players should not expect an updated Risk, it&#039;s really a different game that borrows mechanics from the original.  Once you get over that hurdle, it&#039;s very enjoyable.

RATING: 2.5
Convinced to play this late at night by a Boro fan who told me it was an hour long and 'much better than basic risk'. Both statements were out by two hours.

Take Risk. Now add pointless complications, 'energy', bidding for turn order, 'leaders', underwater territories, space stations linking to moon territories, d8s. Now compress the resupply table so that a player with 1 territory resupplies with 3 armies, whilst a player needs 20+ territories to get to 5 armies (which makes the painfully repetitive losing and retaking of territories even worse). Then limit the game to 5 rounds to build up hope.

Then make each of the rounds over 30 minutes long.

What have you got? A game where you spend 95% of your time rolling 2 dice vs 3 dice or 3 dice vs 2 dice. Yes, just like basic Risk except for the 5% added pointlessness and the 3 hour playing time (which newer versions of Risk rightly reduce to 1 with the mission cards). What was the point?

I was going to mark this a 2, but I will give it a 2.5 because there is just the slightest chance I will play it again under the right circumstances.

At gunpoint for example.

A refreshing reboot of a classic yet tragically flawed game.  I refuse to play the original Risk because of its inherent flaws, but the several times I've played the 2210 version I've had a lot of fun.  Go for the moon?  Develop your nuclear commander?  Lots of different options that keep this one engaging over multiple plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Among the better published variants for the RISK franchise. Introduces leaders, undersea territories, and territories on the moon. A rich and "meaty" version of RISK that uses "energy" points to broaden the options and opportunities of the players. Also of positive note was the decision to limit the game to five rounds of play.

Splendid addition to the RISK family. The addition of Lunar and undersea's Water territories really bring the original game to life! Command cards invigorate gameplay and cause flat out havoc.

A little tough getting used to the new territory names for those of us so used to the original, though.

The new and improved Risk! Gone are the monster stacks with the attendant wrist wracking dice-fests that went with them. Bidding for turn order, five turn limit and power cards, all make Risk 2210 far more interesting to play...yet at its heart it is still Risk. This, along with LotR:Risk, represent the best facelifts of an old chestnut in quite a while!

Risk dressed up in new colours - definite improvement over the original, limiting it to 5 turns is a big help for a start. However it's still risk underneath and has the same problems, lots of downtime, overly long and rather random. Needs the right players. Much prefer the Starwars themed risk games.

Great update to the Risk game genre.  Something new when it came out, though now there are many other versions.  Gladly play a few times a year.

Played this game on the weekend for the first time. As a veteran gamer I found this game initially fun due to the destructive nature, novelty cards, pieces, theme and eye candy components. Towards the end I developed a serious hatred towards it, player were getting angry at each other, there is huge luck with dice and "one shot stops all" cards. The last turn comes down to pure luck and arguing who will crush who. Something perverse will keep me coming back once in a while but overall a disgustingly violent luck fest, best to be avoided. You have no control over your destiny in this game, I hate those type of games.

My only complaint is the end-game action. The game is capped at five rounds, which usually means that everyone recklessly spams across the board during their last turn. I like to play with no round limit because it results in more strategic play (at the cost of dragging the game out longer).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
UPDATE: While this isn't a terrible game, there is no reason to play it instead of the two excellent Star Wars Risk games. Like Nexus Ops, 2210 gets killed by the need to do the economic management of spending money, which creates unacceptable downtime in my opinion. The Star Wars Risk games' decision to eschew economics in favor of violence seems more appropriate to the genre.
---
On the one hand, I was pleasantly surprised by how comparatively good this game was. On the other hand, it wasn't enough to keep me from selling it :) The game actually succeeds in bringing Risk into the modern gaming world, with a lot of good new stuff, less of the cataclysmic feel, and more ways to come back once behind. If the game were a bit shorter and more interactive, it would be a keeper. But it's not - it still takes a long time between turns and the game runs too long for comfort, especially as more players clearly make for a more interesting game, but also make for more problematic downtime.

An improvement over the original and also the one with mission cards due to the fixed number of turns though this doesn't necessarily make it any shorter. The command cards for each leader type are interesting but increase the luck in the game. The nuclear cards were fun (if highly random) to use. Still has the problem that the rich get richer (unless unselfishly ganged up on by the rest).

Likes: The generals really allow a player to specialize their strategy if they so choose. Also, there are many ways to break the boring fronts that develop in regular Risk.

Dislikes: It's still Risk. The main problem with this game is that it almost always seems to be a 4-round arms race with the game exploding on the last round, since no one wants to start a conflict early and be weak for the last round.

When I play Risk, this is one of the 2 Risk games I enjoy playing.
Take over the moon, the seas and land.

I like having the cards to play as well.  It adds another stategic element, and it's unknown what you or your opponents are holding back.

Picked this up a few years ago and it became the favorite game of my group. I have all the extra cards and maps. We play this game almost every other week and we try new this with it. We redesigned some of the cards and made new ones to really make it alot of fun. It to the point every one in my group has a risk 2210 game and they all play thier cards and mechs. Some redesigned the mechs. Its a great game and the mission cards chage every thing about the game.

A very solid game in my opinion. On the negative side it could be said the luck in drawing the right cards is even more unbalancing than the luck of the dice. However over five turns you should have a chance to aquire enough decent cards to have a shot at winning in the last round with everyone else. On the positive side this game has it hands down over the classic version. The commanders, energy, cards, moon, and sea territories adds a lot to this game. Having only 5 turns not only speeds up the game but adds a great deal of balance. Generally speaking it is not in your interest to eliminate someone because if you focus all your strength on one opponent the others will pass you. This makes for a tight game where all people can usually stay competitive. The card play is very important. Which presents many strategies over the classic game. Just one of many considerations is holding on to at least one frequency jaming card to make sure you can target at least one player on round 5 perferably the front runner. If he plays a cease fire on you it can be a game winner. The frequency jam avoids this. One of the best strategies if you can get away with it is to hold on to lots of cards. This should give you enough of a edge in the later rounds to win. However the drawback of this strategy is while the others are playing their cards you will be on the losing end of more than your share which results in less energy and even fewer cards so this can backfire. You will need to use the proper amount of diplomacy to point out that your inferior position means your opponent should be attacking someone else to keep the game balanced. Hopefully he's not counting cards into the balance. Have fun.

If your going to play Risk, this is the Risk to play. The map is slightly different each game due to the radioactive markers.

By far the best of the RISK Varients I have played. This is cool. Limited number of Turns, No Fortress Austalia, and "It got Nuked Before hand" with the added dimplomacy aspects make this a near perfect game.

I'm not much of a fan of Risk or Risk clones these days, but if I had to pick one of the many versions to play, it would probably be Risk 2210 A.D.  The sci-fi theme, the moon, the leaders and the five round time limit all add to my enjoyment of this Risk variant.

I love this game, but games with this much random luck (ie, the die rolling) very often screw me over.  I'd love to see a modded version similar to the PC risk game, where the more men you have in relation to who you're fighting, the more high numbers are on your dice.

Played a dozen times or so. Still in great shape. Is the big, rectangle box edition. May be missing a 3 or 5 count Red Army piece. Also includes quite a bit of custom Frontline expansions. A couple different versions of the factions (a laminated sheet version and the card version with extra factions from grinborg). Laminated 1 side Tech Commander cards I created (look pretty good). Tech  Commander standees (sized right). Generic set of Invasion Of Amoebas just printed on paper. Complete set of grinborgs Mars Territory cards printed double sided on cardstock. And grinborgs mars map (printed in sections and taped together - looks pretty good though). Mars map would have to be folded or rolled and shipped separately.

I enjoyed the beginning and middle game to a mild extent. However it became evident to me that since the game was very close coming into the final turn that whoever went last would win the game. The game went to hell in a hand basket the last round. With limited or no future consequences for your actions; this of course results in strategy and tactics that would be considered foolish in any other phase. The end is too luck dependent and the last player can usually go total suicide and win.

I will not rate this game until I have played it a few times and get a feel for the limited turn system they added.

Just becuase you've added stuff, doesn't mean you've improved it.  So it's slightly more comlicated.  It's comlicated in ways that don't compliment the spirit of Risk.  Think of it like this: when you add peanut butter to chocolate, you compliment both flavors.  When you add watermelon to chocolate, you're just watering down the chocolate.  What's the point?

Good points - turn limit.

Bad points - pretty much everything else, and even the turn limit messes things up a bit.

The main problem I always had with risk is the lack of a turn limit, making the game go on far to long, so when I saw that this added one on I had high hopes. However there is just so much more randomness. The cards range from pointless to game winning, stations and commanders don't seem to add that much and the moon is just plain silly. Plus who goes last has a massive advantage.

Add to that the problems of normal risk, and I don't see why anyone would bother.

Risk has always been one of those games that I thought was outstanding when I was younger, before I was exposed to German board games. When 2210 came along, I at first rejoiced, thinking that the fixed number of turns solved the interminable endgame of the original, while the extra bells and whistles made it more a "full-fledged" game.

Unfortunately, multiple plays showed that this version of Risk simply traded one critical endgame flaw for another. In 9 out of 10 games of Risk 2210 AD, the player who goes last on the fifth turn wins. The only times I ever saw otherwise were when a player went last on turn 4 and first on turn 5, building up a lead too great for the other players to erode behind him.

I have trouble understanding those who claim this game is superior to the original Risk.

People complain that Risk takes too long. Well, this game is longer, despite the 5-turn limit. There is MUCH more downtime. Expect to wait up to 45 minutes before your turn comes up.

People complain that Risk has too much luck. Well, this game has dice AND cards. Will anyone claim that having a deck full of "Screw You" cards actually improves gameplay? Is it more fun when the plan you've been formulating for the last 45 minutes goes down the tube because of 1 card play?

A truly dreadful experience. And I LIKE Risk!

Picked this up at another Half Price Books (yes they need to send me more coupons).  I played this once at a friends and really liked the implementation of the game.  I felt it added some complexity to risk but also kep the spirit of the game, plus my buddy Tim might actually play this version of Risk with me...maybe.

Using the BGG rating here. It's plain, with lots of dice. If you like Risk, you'll love it. If you're reading that it's shortened down becasue of 5 turns, don't get too excited because it's still pretty long.

This is actually MUCH better than 'Risk'.  It's almost a shame to have the name 'Risk' in the title.  The game play, ideas, and feel of the game are different.

My first boardgame back in the day was Risk. I don't particular enjoy risk anymore, but Risk 2210 adds just a wee bit of tactics and strategy with energy auctions and card buying to make it go from something I'd pass to something I occasionally enjoy playing with like minded friends.

One of my favorite risk games. There's a limit of 5 turns on the game, so it requires a lot more strategy than the normal versions of risk. Still very luck-based, but I don't think it's as easy for a few lucky rolls to solely determine a winner.

Definitely an enjoyable game, but it does take a long time to play and i'm not sure how much more time i'm going to give it now that i own Risk: Legacy.

A good Risk variant, and the one i would play most if it wasn't for Legacy.

The card stock is a bit of a disappointment though. Really thin and only one sided. I'm delighted to have found it for only £12 though.

A real improvement on risk.  Everything is better, from the defined game length.  The need to be more aggressive and not just take 1 territory at a time waiting for a set...  Everything.

People like to whine about Risk, but this is a great version. Only 5 turns long, yet it doesn't feel too short for your average Risk fan. Bidding for turn order, special units and cards make this so much more tactical than Risk. And if you start losing bad, then you can just nuke everything and hope for the worst. There is a moon; how awesome is that?! That being said, if you don't like thrashers, you probably still won't like this one.

I've tried making homemade copies of some of the Frontline expansions out there. Progress so far:

[thing=31727]Tech Commanders[/thing] - printed. Not sure what I'm going to do about the actual commander units yet.
[thing=31728]Factions[/thing] - downloaded, printed, laminated and cut up, thanks to user Godinex.
[thing=31729]Giant Amoebas[/thing] - printed. May try to find some cheesy toy aliens, or just some tokens.

No idea if I'll ever have the time or inclination to make my own [thing=31726]Mars expansion[/thing]: I'm guessing not.

Risk, set in the future, with some added mechanics.

Finally get to play this (against young Matt) in a practice trial game.  Despite all the game comments I have read about it, I just find it too fussy - - I think Im a simple Euro guy, and this is not my type of game, and Im unlikely to play this again (4/1/11).  UPDATE: Game now archived (17/9/11). UPDATE: Dust gathering, now gone (Rating 4.582, Jan 17). UPDATE No one bought it, which is good, as I would like one serious play before I decide (Jan 17).

Although I originally bought it on a lark, I think this game is a blast. Easy to learn (due to the classic Risk substrate), but really opens the classic gameplay on many levels to a large number of differing strategies (and -- interestingly -- aggression levels). Never thought I could say this about a Risk-based design -- but it has become one of my favorite board games.

While bored one summer, I created my own Mars map within the main game. It has a separate set of territories, adds a few new cards to each general deck, and gives the ability to specify how to use your space general. Un-like the Moon, there is travel lag between going to Mars and coming back to Earth-Moon system.

Units who leave their space station, can enter into a landing pattern that takes two years to land. Thus any forces that leave in year one are not available until year three (unless a card is drawn to speed up travel).

It was fun to make but it is a personal project a few friends and I have played.

I think this was the game where I finally decided that I'm just not a Risk fan. Risk 2210 is certainly the best looking game of the series and I give top notch points for presentation. The game went by at a good pace, even though it took 3 hours. And I generally had fun the whole time. So where does it fail? It's still a random dicefest, which it should be given its namesake. Extra stuff has been thrown in which gives each player more control and decision making; but really it just adds more chaos that is difficult to control. There is lots that could be done to improve your outcome, but the whole rich-get-richer mechanic means the game is somewhat decided early on, heavily dependent on luck. The weird thing is, in the last round there was a wild point swing, due to very heavy bonus point cards and wonky last round rules that let me gain 12 territories with no one to stop me. In the end, Mike won, but only because if random card pulls. I think Risk 2210 was the best attempt to make something of this system, but ultimately there is too little to grasp onto here. Even if taking over most of the moon in one turn was pretty cool!

RATING: 6
An ok strategy game, a VAST improvement over the child-like original game.  Many things to do, invade the moon, water colonies, buy comanders, cards.  The turn order even changes each turn!  This is done with bidding energy which you get each turn in addition to troops.  

A great strategy is to make sure you can out-bid people and take the last turn spot.  Put all of your troops on a territory with a spaceport and buy your space-commander then invade to moon and get as much of it as you can, make sure you keep enough energy to out-bid people again.  Now get first spot and you get all of the bonuses without having to defend them.  Basically you get two turns in a row!

The downside is the very long play time plan on spending 4 hours to play, 5 if it's your first time.  I suggest time limits on people's turns.  Still has the same overall feeling of the original though.

A comment I often heard: &quot;it&#039;s still Risk, blah-blah&quot;... No, it&#039;s not.
I always liked playing the old Risk, but compared to the new one, it&#039;s just... boring and slow. This version offers a lot more action, no more taking-a-continent-and-digging-in.
One can&#039;t afford to be passive, since the game ends in just 5 rounds.
And, last but not least, great looking game. Nice map, highly detailed miniatures and great graphics on the action-cards.

It does indeed fix some of the worst problems with Risk, but introduces some new ones.  In particular, there's a new very strong "end of the world" syndrome at the end of the appointed number of turns.  The new card additions are good, but the nukes seem like they can make that all important last turn random.  I didn't really get into the generals.

On top of that, it's still Risk with really only one type of unit (excluding the generals) and no real geographic or terrain differences.  Risk will just never be an absolute favorite for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This has to be the most superior Risk game out there on the market. If you are a Risk fan, this is a must own.

The commanders are a great addition, the extra water territories are wonderfull and really changes the strategies that everyone is so used to (ie, take over Australia). I love the "Nuked" zones, they are great. I once played a game where all of Australia was nuked except for one or two countries. Easy way to keep a continent =).

The cards really add a new dimension with bombs and stealth mods etc. The army tokens (M.O.Ds - Machines of Destruction) are well modeled for this type of game.

It also comes with a "moon" board. Not only that, but it is structured to end in 5 turns. So you know that the game will eventually end.

Great great expansion. My only con for this game is that it is only 2-5 players. When a 6th player is SO needed for it. Often times in a four player game, two guys squabble over the land, one takes the sea or also squabbles with the land guys, while the third drops his horde of troops on a base and blasts off to the moon. The other three are too involved in their squabbling for any to take a counter initiative against the moon, and that player quickly captures moon continents and re-enforces his territories, then attacks the earth.

A good strategy that pisses me off each time it's used =)

My wife guessed right i think, that people have played Risk so much as a youth that its worn out its welcome. This is why i have i get a weary-eyed look when asking people to play this with me. 

The card stock is abysmal but the game play is fast. Cards modify the powers of the teams and you bid resources to choose the first player of each round.

Better than Small World. Better than standard Risk. You REAALLY REALLY learn fast the importance of bidding on a turn. IF you dont the last player will be behind the 8 ball pretty fast.

Well it's a big improvement over regular Risk, anyway (which, even with the mission cards, seems to outstay its welcome by a factor of 3). 2210 adds a bit more depth, and a bit more unpredictability, plus it has a fixed length, meaning I'll take this over the original any time. The ending is a bit broken (the last player to take a turn has a huge advantage) but I'm sure I can persuade my group to house-rule a fix (or let me go last if they don't agree that it needs fixing). Not sure if I'll ever play it again, as my Risk-loving friends would rather play the version they grew up with, and I'd never posit a Risk variant when there are better games to play (i.e. nearly any other game in my collection).

Probably my favorite of the Risk franchise.  I like CO powers and the use of energy instead of the old turn in card mechanic.  I like having to choose what to spend energy on each round.  Do I bid for turn order, buy cards or commanders, keep some in reserve to play future cards, etc.?  The unit pieces are nicely done and reinforce the theme.  This is a game you play to have fun.  It's not one you can enjoy if you expect to win every game.  It's also not for people who must have calibrated balance in every aspect, or for people who take conflict games personally.

Yuck! I dont like this game at all.  A like to call the original Risk &quot;Luck&quot;.  This game I call &quot;Super Luck&quot;  The moon thing is dumb.  The Cards just add more luck.  The five turn limit means your luck does not have time to average out, and adds to the &quot;attack the leader&quot; symdrome.  The leaders add nothing to the game.  Players would be better off rolling 5 dice and the highest roll wins and save themselves 3 hours.

Hands down the BEST version of Risk ever made!  I do not think anything will ever top this in the boardgame versions.  Three different parts of the world to fight for control of, and in the end I have never seen anyone hold control, five turns, each about an hour in lenght, depending on how many people you have involved.  We almost always have 5.  So have your day cleared to play this one, kids!  It&#039;s worth it!

RATING: 9
"Future Risk" fixes almost all the flaws in what was already a very good game.  Any group who likes Risk is going to pick this one up and probably never go back.

One drawback: the game only lasts 5 turns, and while this is a defining and positive element of the game, it means the player who goes last on turn 5 has an unfair advantage because he doesn't have to defend his new territories.  After a few plays you may want to houserule some handicap regarding turn order on the last turn, or just punch your friend in the arm if he pulls something like this.

This game has many notable improvements over the original Risk, my favorite being the five year turn limit.  Games tend to be blood-thirsty and alliance-dependant.  The moon and the ocean are resources that need to be exploited early, and NEVER overlooked when attacking on the map.  Try to get an energy lead early, and the best slot to go in Year 5 is last... <grin>

Amazing game. Few boardgames instill the same array of emotions. When you win, it feels like you've really conquered the world. Unfortunately the losses can be quite hard to handle as well... Playing time is quite long (3-5 hours), but it's worth it. There is a disbalance in the last year, because the final player doesn't need to worry about defence anymore. In actual gaming this is balanced immediately, when the other players figure out the advantage. Only bid yourself last, if your position cannot be crumbled by other player's concentrated effort... :)

By far the best Risk variant both in rules and in theme. The generals are great, the map is excellent, the command cards are always a good investment, but they are pricy in comparison to other things you could spend energy on. (Think development cards in settlers). Well balanced. The variable turn order as well as the shortened game (5 rounds) means that even 5-player games will only last a couple hours with experienced players (the 240 minutes above is WAAAY off). That said, it's still Risk. It's a game of controlling luck (how many armies do you commit to something ultimately determined by dice?) and area control. Taking more area can get you more armies but also spreads you thin. In regular Risk, this leads to ammassing big armies in small areas. This strategy doesn't work in 2210 because of 2 things: (1) command cards that punish big groups of armies and (2) the number of rounds. The designers took a classic game, identified and fixed the flaws, added more strategy, a better theme, and made it generally more fun, while still maintaining that classic Risk flavor. If the last part of that sentance was the only thing that made you cringe, I'm sorry; at its heart, it is still Risk. But whether you like Risk or not, this is the best version you will ever play.

Take the stupid amount of randomness in vanilla Risk and take a couple small steps forward and a couple small steps back.  The theme is cooler, I like the apocalyptic setting.  I also like the water spaces and how the board can be different depending on where the initial nukes end up.  I kinda like the fixed turns because it limits the game time but it also makes bidding for turn order a bit too important.  Add some special units and D8s to give combat at least the slight feeling of tactical action which is alright at first glance but really is pretty shallow.

The above feel like very minor improvements.  The disappointments are many though.  The cards add even more randomness!  A stupid, stupid amount of randomness.  So much randomness that it is terribly awful and worse than the base game.  You can't attack a person on the last turn because of a card?  You can blow up random stuff and screw random people randomly?  At least the cards in vanilla Risk were easy enough to see what they would do and approximately when they would be played by other players.  This is complete randomness at its worst.  The combat is still just roll dice and hope for the best with just a tiny improvement with the D8 systems.  The moon seems pointless and easy to turtle.  The random cards that remove a unit from the entire continent are awesome too.  One other great thing is with all the names being different, it takes a while to even see where the heck cards are affecting.  Just another small irritant to a list of many.

Really it's just too much random, very little fun, and compared to vanilla Risk, no improvement.  It feels like a step back in that there is less planning and tactics because of all the random crap that can happen.  I would not play this game again, it took too long for an extremely low fun value.  I'd take vanilla Risk before I ever play this luck fest again.

No comment made on initial play. I recall it was Risk in five turns, with new units, new combat, and new spaces on the board.

Update (10/01/11): It really bothered me that Risk would be confined to five turns. I am used to Risk being played to the bitter end, with player elimination. Inevitably, someone would plop down one or two Risk sets, with a mountain of units, and steamroll over all other opposition. With introduction of new units (and dice types!) and other new elements, I suspect this would easily push the game length to unacceptable limits, and therefore the designers put a turn-limit on the game. In this manner, this feels more like Shogun. You are simply trying to consolidate your position, and not take over the world. In that regard, this design works. Will I ever play it again? Who knows.

This one gets a ten for solving all the problems of classic risk and then going a few steps farther.  Not just a theme slapped onto the classic (I'm talking to you Halo risk) but a unique experience.  What's cooler than losing the land battle but taking it to the sea, regrouping, losing it all again and then spending your few remaining points to gain a nuke and then winning it all back...nothing, that's what.  The perfect bridge game for non-gamers that might have the spark,the perfect stepping stone into a new hobby.  This game is the only must have TRU carries so you have no excuse.  -H7

One of the best versions of Risk out there. The use of "energy" to buy leaders and cards adds a lot to the game. I also like how they expanded the gameboard to include underwater areas and the Moon. Only plays for five turns, but each turn feals dynamic and full of important decisions. Only caveat is that, much like regular Risk, there's a lot of down-time when it's not your turn. For the patient among us, though, it's a great game.

Much better than the original Risk. While you could still be eliminated it is highly unlikely that you will. Unlike the traditional Risk where the game goes on until someone has conquered the whole earth. This one ends after 5 turns. In this version players can conquer the moon, sea territories & land territories. They can also setup bases & use commanders that give different advantages based on the terrain from which they are fighting in & from. Cards that can be earned also add various helpful effects & none of them are broken or overpowered.

Easily the best of the Risk variants I've played (although I've yet to try Godstorm).  I used to play Risk a lot and harbored a secret hatred for it.  Now that ive discovered BGG and expanded my games collection ten fold, I outright loathe it.  Rarely has a Risk night ended without someone dropping an f-bomb and claiming to never talk to another individual ever again...At least this version has a time limit and a few more options to even out the downright stupid battle resolutions (evil, evil dicefest).  This is probably the only way I'd ever play Risk now that I think about it...If ever again.

This really surprised me.  When it first came out I thought...who needs it.  Gave it a try and has become a favorite.

Won the game in crushing fashion. Who said going last is an advantage?

Description: The classic game of conquest with a few twists. Sea and moon colonies are added to traditional continents. Special cards provide hidden units or other abilities.

Pro: New rules and complexity add to the game. Moon and Sea colonies provide additional paths to victory, and make it harder to defend. Turn limit prevents excessively long games.

Con: Ultimately decided by random dice rolling. Still only one type of army. Game consists of nothing but military conflict.

A whole new spin on risk, with the added features and spiced up components a sure-fire recipe for success!

RATING: 5
It's an ok variation on Risk. I love the theme and components (especially the army pieces and colors) but overall the game just feels too cumbersome and chaotic.

I don't think it really solves any of the classic complaints about Risk (a game of which I am actually a bigger fan than most, it would seem), and instead introduces new issues regarding balance and complexity. "Gamer" gamers are going to enjoy the added features, but those people are usually the ones who aren't interested in Risk in the first place, while the more casual gamers are more likely to play and will feel overwhelmed by all the additions. Also the five year (5 turns) game limit is nice for time considerations, but feels incredibly artificial and gamey. It would have been nice if there was a more thematically palatable end condition. Or a soft end-game trigger of some kind.

One of my favorite aspects to the game is having the moon as a conquerable area, but sadly it is woefully under-realized. On the positive side, nuking areas at the beginning of the game is far too fun. I love how it changes the tactical layout of the map to something different each game. 

I want to like this game a lot more than I do, but when thinking honestly, I'd rather just play classic Risk using mission cards vs. playing this variation. What is nice is that one can use the board (which is lovely) and pieces (which are awesome) to just play a classic mode game. 

This is not one that I'll likely pull out very often.

A much better game than Risk in every respect, although that really isn't saying much.  Still suffers from the "weakest player gets the pole" problem.  The country names are amusing and in some cases hilarious (like "Andorra" taking up the entire Iberian Peninsula).  The commanders with their own cards are a good idea as well.  There's only five turns in the game, ensuring that the game will end at some point.  Even with this time limit however, the game is still too long.

I love this game, I play regularly with my brother and girlfriend. We have our older brother come play too sometimes for 4 players. Hopefully someday we can find a good 5th player, we've had a few but they are either too uninterested in the game or just can't play regularly.

FOR SALE Risk with extra territory's based on the Moon. Adds extra time but not much extra strategy to an already too long simple roll the dice and fight wargame. I enjoyed Risk enough when I was growing up, but now I enjoy playing it as a computer app to speed things up. OK

RATING: 4
Overly complicated and boring.  Really, really boring.

Avalon Hill (Read: Hasbro) wanted to make a Risk edition which approached the problems most people had with regular old "Risk".

It can get pretty long for casual gamers.
It is the same board every time.

So, they made the game have only five turns (very long, boring turns.  You will sleep).  Also they nuke areas of the map, which are unususable for the rest of the game (this was actually a really cool idea, and worked to make the game a little more interesting).

Just don't buy it until you've played it first.

DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A BETTER RISK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  

It is actually MORE RANDOM than the original, this is 5 hours I will NOT get back, what a waste. 

The problems are many and I fell for people on this site hyping this version as the best version, it is certianly the most interesting, and in fact maybe the best to play since it does at least has a time limit, BUT it is still a random dice fest with even MORE randomness thrown in, so dont be fooled like I was thinking it might be a cool game, if you thought regular risk was only okay, you probably wont like this any better.

Tons of special power stuff in the game is very cool but most of it is all quite powerful and completely random. For example, draw one Risk card from the deck, blow up half your opponents armies on that spot?????? RIDICULOUS I SAY!!!! Many more unfortunate examples.   

The Moon is overpowered and broken without houserules, if someone justs walks up and takes it like first turn by having all their men on one spot and then abonding earth, they get 13 men per turn, ouch! It is not that easy to go up there and fight them and they only have to protect 3 spots versus the Earth where you have to protect many more spots in the Continents. Players have to gang up on a player that does this and buy ALL the space cards before this player does to combat this strategy, could be interesting but that doesnt change the facts.  

5 turns doesn’t fix anything and only ensures whoever goes last, will almost always win, since most territories wins and everyone overextends themselves trying to win the last turn, whoever goes last has a major advantage, especially if its the moon player. With 5 players it was still 5 hours too, could have been 4 maybe but we did not play slowly and that is still very long. 

I would only consider playing this with 2 players or maybe 3 (downtime is quite bad and to have a shorter game overall), but overall I will NEVER be playing any version of RISK ever again. There are tons of other multiplayer war games to choose from that give this kind of experience and are just WAY better than this and far less random as well.

RATING: 2
This game is entirely aggravating.  Granted, I may have had some very poor dice rolls, which is the nature of the beast, but when my entire army is cut off on the moon, meaning I can't reinforce, move, or do anything about it, and the rest of my armies back on Earth get nuked to oblivion, thus rendering me a useless player that is not technically eliminated...  I have never had such a difficult time holding myself from flipping the table in my life.

If you fall behind for a split second, your opponent can, and probably will, immediately win.  This is made ridiculously possible by the "cool extra features" that make this different than regular Risk.  The game only lasts 5 turns.  I have never lived passed the second turn, and the games have never gone passed turn 3.  Ever.  What happened to regular Risk that lasted like 100 turns?  Risk 2210 should have been called, "Nuke Your Friends," with accompanying expansion, "You'll never play this because you have no friends now."

Seriously, it's that bad.

Risk on steroids.  Much better than vanilla Risk.  Biggest drawback is the length of the game.  I find it takes about 4 hours to play a game with 5 people.  The 5 turn limit is good, but so much is happening that it takes a player about 10 minutes to take their turn.  Combined with the bids for turn order, you could find yourself with a lengthy wait between turns.  Fortunately, it's pretty entertaining to watch other players get blown up and havoc wreaked everywhere, so that it isn't as bad as it seems.

This is so much better than regular risk.  I wish I could play it more often, but it takes a while with so many pieces.  If I could stop the game and not have my kids mess with the pieces, I would.  I like that it has  a limited amount of turns, instead of the global domination aspect that sometimes can take hours in plain Risk.  Of course, if you want to play plain Risk on this board, you can.

Risk 2210 adds some interesting elements to the classic Risk system and, in doing so, makes for an interesting experience. The futuristic setting ends up being mostly chrome, but the advent of commanders (and their respective decks) brings new layers to the game. I'm still not sure how I feel about the five-turn limit. While it does make for a shorter game, it feels a bit anticlimactic (and also makes bidding for turn order on the final turn more important than it probably should be). I would have liked to have seen mission cards instead. As it stands, this is a fine, worthy entry into the Risk family.

I agree with those who say: the most welcome mechanic in the game is the limit of Five Turns = Endgame.  It makes the players become far more aggressive & with the addition of the command deck (a set of cards which change the game's dynamic), makes them VERY aggressive!  It's still RISK, but it's far better than the original game (which sucks!).  I'd play it again with anyone who wanted to play a war game & didn't want to take the time to learn a better strategy board game.

Early on, I was enamored with the setting as it was being setup. I had excitement about playing. I expected the standard Risk shenanigans, but these other elements on top of it? Sure! A 5 round limit? I'm even more intrigued. 

But every round cut my enjoyment by half. This is even more random than standard Risk. By the third round, I wanted to be done. I tried to enjoy it, but the game's system - not my opponents - kept beating me down with unlucky card draws and dice rolls.

I will never ask to play this game again. It would take some coercing for me to do so. 

Despite some elements I liked, even more than the original risk, I think I'd almost rather play the original risk.

Probably the best of the Risk games I've played. Five turns keeps the game fairly short. A nice variety of commander rules allow players to decide which course of conquest they wish to pursue (including a diplomatic course). And the nuclear markers keep the map different every game.

As always, the luck of dice plays a huge part, as does the cards you draw, but players do have a great deal more choice in this game than other Risk games.

This risk edition is limited to 5 rounds of play, which means you won't have any one person take a continent and squat on it. As such there is a lot more combat and land grabbing.

Additional cards, generals, and space ports (which act as a fortification as well) are introduced to allow some more strategic play, but ultimately it falls to the traditional dice rolls and who can roll 6's the most (or 8's with a general).

Turn order in each round is bid for, which can cause a HUGE swing if the last player from the round before becomes the first player in the next round. And the 'Cease fire' card (Diplomat) should be banned as it turns round 5 into a horrible way to end the game.

Based on 10+ plays.  Risk 2210 is certainly my favorite Risk variant, but that's faint praise.  The leaders and strategy cards add a new element to the game, while the five-turn limit makes the length more reasonable.  But it's still overly long and engenders too many hurt feelings and/or king-making.  If I'm going to be playing a Risk-like game at all, I'd rather do Nexus Ops.

This is definitely not a strategy game. The basic idea is just to gather a huge army in one area and start moving all around the board by conquering every one and every thing. Also the cards are horrible because they unbalance the game even more. So overall the rich get richer and thus its almost impossible to catch up with the leader because he has all the resources to buy special cards, which in turn gives him special abilities. I prefer Axis and Allies over this game any day.

YES!! I finally managed to snag my own copy! THIS is the best risk game ever. It becomes the default game we play, when we have only a few people. sadly..its only 5 players, so if more show up, we have to play something else.

Bleach!
Cards are WAY overpowered. What? You add cards to a game where you already have absolutely no control?
The 5 turns limit is an artifial way to limit the lenght of the game. Inelegant and ineffective. It's still looooong and boring.
The player who play LAST in the LAST turn win. Ditto.
The only good idea is the territories nuked at the start of the game.
Friends convinced me 4 or 5 times to play this. And I played just to stay with friends but it is really too much bad.
Never again.

Got this at Toys'R'Us, as they had a Two for One deal going (also picked up Heroscape with it). Prob. not my style, but it was SO cheap!!

Having now played a few games solo (Invasion Earth, which I downloaded thanks to an ad on the Geek), I think this might really be worth my time.  Need to see it hit the table one of these days, as it's fun even against the rather dry computer opponents.

RATING: N/A
Although much has been added, the basic flavor of the game is still Risk. One welcome change is the institution of a five-turn game limit, which allows the game to play to completion in about three hours. Further, players must also factor in economics in the form of energy. This energy is used to purchase Command cards, bid for Turn Order, and hire new commanders. There is much more strategy and planning involved in this new version, but it should still appeal to the classic Risk fans.

Had to modify rules that Energy distribution at beginning of turn was not based on territories, but was given to each player evenly, based on classic risk card turn-in structure per round.  Otherwise, once in the lead it is easier to stay in the lead.

RATING: 9
I have not have the opportunity to play this game very often, but the few times I have, it's been thoroughly enjoyable. It adds great deal more strategic elements, and gives depth to what originally was mostly a luck-based game. Granted, the element of luck is still strong, but there are a lot more player choices, and the optimal decision isn't always so blatantly obvious.

The radiation markers make each game different.  The bidding on turn order gives the player the opportunity to exploit control of richer regions (especially Europe) that would be broken in a constant turn order game.  Suffers from last turn blitzkriegs.  Recommend negotiating a separate peace on the Moon.

RATING: 7
If you're a Risk lover, this is a must have.  Really fantastic version with lots of different options.  Some sessions are well balanced and some are blowouts, but it's always a good time.  My only complaint is that the final round can suffer from a lot of AP and can have dramatic swings.

A very imaginative change on classic risk. Limited turns, resource management and having those limited resources be used for turn order bidding. Additional territories of seas & the moon. I mean really, who does not want to take over the moon? The commanders & cards add a lot to the game as well. Again a little lucky with the cards you draw. I rarely win this game, but I do enjoy it and usually try to make it competitive. 

My only issue with the game is that the last or second to last player usually wins on the last turn since they don't have to worry as much about defending their borders & can push their armies all the way out to a 1:1 battle to try and take more territories or just take one territory away form someone's continent bonus. We solved this with a random roll of the die to determine if it was really the last round of the game. 1,2 or 3, game ends, 4,5 or 6, one more persons turn. End of their turn game ends with a 1,2,3 or 4...and so on for possible three more peoples turns.

I was very disappointed by this game after hearing a lot of good things here on BGG.  In theory, the new rules and the addition of the commanders should  make this game a real gem, providing more depth to classic Risk.  Instead, it just bogs down the game, and the addition of the cards introduces a whole new element of randomness that cannot be calculated.

While classic Risk has its share of randomness (obviously, the roll of the dice), these odds can be calculated and accounted for.  For example, it's clear that 10 armies can conquer the territory with only 2 armies.  It may not be as quick and easy as one would want, but victory is mostly assured, except in only the most extreme cases.  Because of this, players can make calculations about how many armies they want to invest in certain territories.  Players can assess the odds and risks.

The cards in 2210, however, create swings of luck and dominance that cannot really be contemplated by the players.  Because your opponents' cards are hidden, there is just no way to account for them.  While the cards add extra "flavor," they do so at the expense of strategy.  There is just no way to make strategic or tactical plays to counter some of these cards.

I'll take classic Risk any day over this version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Another great variation of Risk.  Use of "commanders" adds more strategy and the ability to battle underwater as well as on the moon is a lot of fun.  Not sure if I like this better than Lord of the Rings Risk but it is up there.

An improved version of Risk. I like the cards specific to the various types of commanders you can get. I'm not sure I like the bidding for turn order at all, maybe a turn order rotation would be better. So, it's better than its predecessor... damning with faint praise I know.

Set in the not-so-distant future, battles are now fought by machines of destruction, known as MODS, for short. Human commanders still lead these mechanized troops, but these commanders each have special powers and abilities. These come into play via the use of Command cards, which add a new dimension to the game. Now, the battle is not just for the continents, but the sea and moon are also battlegrounds.
Although much has been added, the basic flavor of the game is still Risk. One welcome change is the institution of a five-turn game limit, which allows the game to play to completion in about three hours. Further, players must also factor in economics in the form of energy. This energy is used to purchase Command cards, bid for Turn Order, and hire new commanders.

Not only is this Risk without the boredom factor, it's Risk with multiple victory conditions, special cards, shorter play time, and much less chance of sitting around with your thumb up your ass for the whole game. In other words, it's Risk as a good game.

It's fun to play in its own right, too (not just as compared to vanilla Risk), and the components are awesome. I don't know why we don't play it more often.

I'm amazed that something which has the same basic rules as Risk can play so differently. This has many more options than traditional Risk, has some interesting card play and a rapidly changing board on which it's virtually impossible to hold a power base. This is results in game play that is engaging but can feel messy and chaotic. It's also removed the mission-based and diplomatic elements of the original. It's a very different beast.

Rating based on one play with two players where a series of unfortunate events during setup (the nuclear tokens and neutral armies created a typical 'Australia' situation in both Australia and South America) and a string of really, really bad die rolls led to an extremely lopsided game.

If you take these types of games seriously and don't mind the length of the extra turns, you really need to play with some sort of random ending.

Risk done right - the commanders and cards add enough strategy to make decisions actually meaningful (as opposed to being dictated almost entirely by dice) without making it overly complex.  Plus, the 5-turn limit is an absolute godsend compared to the typical 3+ hour game of original Risk. Sold.

I refer to this as "Supremacy Light". But, is orginal enough to enjoy even if you disliked Risk and simple enough for Risk players to pick up. Godstorm is probaly better overall.

Excelente juego. A mi gusto, es una versión avanzada y mejorada del Risk. Aunque la partida tenga un número predeterminado de turnos (5), no te dejes engañar, pues suele alargarse entre 2-3 horas en un combate frenético de fuerzas entre los jugadores. Quizás las cartas de comandante son bastante determinantes, pero es un aliciente más para no quedarse parado en la partida. Piques entre los jugadores casi asegurados, así que recordaros en todo momento que se trata sólo de un juego. ;-)

Significantly improves the basic Risk game by adding some &quot;German&quot; elements such as bidding for turn order and limiting the number of turns. This, combined with the commanders and command cards, adds depth to the game and makes it playable in a reasonable amount of time. Also, the game pieces are of very good quality.

Will not play without house rules.  In fact I will not play any version of Risk without house rules, because I can't tolerate the enormous luck aspect. I have a "three to one" rule which I employ in most wargames that eliminates the extremes of the luck aspect (I'll write an article in the forum explaining this eventually).  I find that "3-1" rule very necessary in this game.  With house rules I think this game is incredibly cool.

It's Risk. In space. The moon base isn't all that necessary, but this version includes some clever mechanics that differentiates this somewhat from the original.

Remember how much you liked Risk before you realized just how bland it could be?  This new version adds just enough to really revitalize the game, without giving it a total overhaul.  New strong defensive options and parallel victory paths allow players to butt heads or not - with equal degrees of success.

RATING: 8
Very fun game.  Really gives you many different ways to attack your enemy, and you really are unable to defend against all forms of attack.

I really enjoyed it.

House Rule:  A fun house rule is to NOT setup the NUKE tokens at the beginning of the game.  Pretend there are still nukes in orbit randomly falling to the earth.  At the beginning of each turn (maybe starting with the second turn), draw a land card.  Place the nuke token on that spot and destroy all troops at that location.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
My favorite variation on Risk.  This is probably my favorite lengthy game.  I like that this feels like Risk, but shorter and with more elements than rolling dice and territory control.  The different commanders each have their own feel to them which makes playing against different people much more exciting.  The biggest hazard of this game is that turns can take too long and there is nothing to do on someone else's turn.  A few cards are consistently frustrating...
Initial thoughts: 7.6

Dropped .2 points: Teaching this game can be a nightmare.

So much better than normal risk.  Strategy is way different than normal risk due to the limited turns.  The last turn is the win or lose turn.  All turns before it are just to prepare you and get strategically placed for the last turn.  If the last turn is played right, the person who was losing all game can still come out the winner.

I used to like Risk when I was a LOT younger but I think I just outgrew it. The original game just seemed like an endless grind. However, Risk 2210 is probably the best variation on the Risk system I've ever played. Its still got some of the same features of original Risk that I've grown a bit tired of but some of the new mechanics like the cards and leader systems add a new dimension to the game. And what's not to like about a game that has nukes! Although I wouldn't play Risk 2210 a lot because its basically still Risk, I would definitely play it again.

A really good variant to classical RISK. Since it is only played for 5 rounds the game forces you to take the most out of each turn and punish turtling. There are a lot of variations, like maps, new commanders and other stuff that enhances the experience. One of my favourite Risk games, along with Risk Europe.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is for me the pinnacle of the RISK series (although I haven't played God Storm).

2210 offers 3 areas of engagement - the Earth, Ocean Cities and the Moon. The game also features a variety of units and more importantly, leaders which can influence the game in different ways. Limited resources and a range of cards (mission, leader, event etc) only add to the games appeal and makes 2210 a game of strategy rather than a game of random luck!

Really disappointed with this one. What sets it apart from other Risk games is that you have commanders that allow you to purchase really powerful cards. The problem is, energy is too hard to come by, and the game is so short that it almost doesn't matter. There are some interesting ideas here, like being able to go to the moon and underwater, but ultimately I prefer Risk Legacy and Risk: Game of Thrones

There isn't anything really wrong with what is in Risk 2210, but what necessitates the low rating is all that is missing.  This is like Risk, but with some good additions.  The new areas are cool, and the different leaders with their different abilities are a good strategic addition.  The cards are sort of interesting, though somewhat unbalanced (see later), and the turn limit is an interesting touch.

The problem here is that there are so many games that do multiplayer combat better because they add other interesting elements.  Risk 2210 is still a slug it out, mass your troops type game, with no other objective than to eliminate your opponents.  This game could really have benefitted from alternate victory conditions, or some other ways to progress towards victory.  What is here is interesting, but there are just better games to play.

Great game, slow set-up but totally worth it. If you enjoy table talk, manipulation, coercion, bribery, threats, and alliances then this is the game for you. Best 3-5 players, 1V1 negates most of the table talk, but a skilled diplomat can still enjoy bluffing their way to a victory. Would Highly Recommend to any and all that enjoy a fun, quick, and mildly complex strategy game.

Great Risk variant with a lot of good ideas that have stood against scrutiny. Very good components and an overall fun game. Because of the large amounts of territories compared to other Risk variants, it's also better for larger numbers of people (whereas Godstorm I like more but prefer with less people for this reason)

UPDATE: This game is good for what it is but there are better sci fi games and better conquest games that are tighter. This isn't even my favorite Risk variant (godstorm) and this game, like most risk games (even variants) drags in ways it doesn't need to. I enjoy the game but I'm getting rid of it in favor of only keeping games I really love.

I think this is the best version of risk I have ever encountered. The combination of limited turns, cards that have to be strategically purchased as tactically used, along with the bids that use energy tokens, make for an exciting game with lots of suspense.

Based on one play: I must admit that Risk is not a game I like, it is long and just random with all the dice battles and the card mechanic of getting new troops is just absurd. I gave 2210 a chance and I was pleasantly surprised. The game lasts 5 rounds, so the endless battles and player elimination is removed. Plus there are battle cards that help you achieve your objective and the bidding for play order really adds some strategy. If you have risk, give it a try, it may surprise you as well.

A good variant on a classic game. The new rules increase complexity somewhat, but the essential gameplay mechanic remains unaltered.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It is quicker than normal Risk, there are more decisions to make (due to commaders, cards, moon and sea regions), the nucleur wasteland areas make each game different, the inbalance of extra armies based on turning in card sets is removed, bidding for turn order is a great innovation. Still waiting to convince  others in our group; their love of Risk runs deep

Cards hold up the game too much. Map is too open. Small tactics work, but not enough overall strategy; not as much as classic Risk.

Suffers from same problem as Axis & Allies; not fast paced enough so people are overly critical to not make mistakes, and it can be as long as an hour between instances where a player can do anything.

Played once. My rating will probably drop to a 6 after repeated plays... First impression was good. Suffers to regular Risk not in it's addition of crome in the form of cards and pretty units, but in it's retention of the same combat system.

12/11/05 dropped to 5. I will probably never suggest, will not buy, and one friend who has it has gotten hooked on Euros. I doubt I will see this one again.

1/08: picked up in mall for 50% off.

2014: Raised to 5.5. I'd rather play this than regular risk. I don't think I will ever play this though, even though I haven't been able to part with it. I think I have an illness.

I will always have a soft spot for Risk.... it was the first game that took me outside the classic family board-game trio of Monopoly, Cluedo and Scrabble. It definitely has its flaws, but I still have very fond memories of day-long (or longer!) sessions sat around the table planning world domination.

Will probably never play it again as Game of Thrones and Eclipse have become my group's go-to games when we're looking for lengthier strategic sesions, hence the trade offer.

RATING: 6
Just upped the rating from 4 after a recent play. Better than I remember it being, but there's a lot of stuff they've added on to classic Risk. Overall I'm still not sure if I like the 5 turn limit, but the bigger problem may be that the cards can be too swingy - being able to play a card that prevents others from playing cards seems too powerful unless there's some sort of counter that I haven't seen. Maybe it's just me. Definitely like the overall board layout and the wastelands mechanic.

I prefer this version of risk to the classic, or even castle risk (both of which I also own). on the rare occasion my group feels like playing Risk, we only pull out this edition. 

It can be quite satisfying to launch a orbital strike from the moon to a random location on earth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A huge improvement over the basic version of Risk. I have played many a game of this, to the point where I'm almost a little tired of it. The 5-turn clock is a brilliant addition to classic Risk gameplay, as it keeps everyone on the offensive and prevents the game going longer than it needs to. Balancing of the special cards is also very good; nothing overly broken or useless, as practically every card has a time when it would be of ideal use.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Too simple game for me.  Sometime a bit dull.  Highly based on luck.  Everyone want to be the last player in the 5th turn.  Not as many strategic thinkings as A&A.

Everyone I have ever played this game with has absolutely loved it. Plays for about the right amount of time, commanders add a new tactical element to it and including the moon was genius. I would have liked the option to play an extended game in the rules and some form of experience for winning battles would have added some sophistication though.

Adss several new elements to classic Risk.  The reason I don't like this as much is that the game ends after five turns; it's kind of an artificial ending.  However, each turn usually takes us about 1 hour, so I can see why it ends the way it does.

I was never a big fan of basic 'Risk', but my initial reaction to all the bits and maps to R2210 was very good.  I have played several games on a friend's board, and every time I think the same thing - theres alot of good ideas and fun possibilities that give the game a good shot at being great, but it all fails horribly with the 5-turn limit.  Time and time again, the person who goes the very last will win, unless other players 'gang up' on that person, in which case, the second last person wins.  It seems that the designers knew that it was either a 5-turn limit or a game that would take all day (and then some) to fully play out.  Why not just play ONE round, and spare yourself bitter conflict with your best friends?  I could be convinced to play again, but I won't be buying it or actively looking to play it again.

Update:
I was kinda hard on this game.. but not by much.  For the time this game takes, you could play so many other better, similar titles with a war-theme.

Perfect for playing with people who used to play games, and aren't really interested in new board games but, probably for nostalgic reasons, are willing to get into a long game of Risk.  
I've never actually played the classic version of Risk.  The currency and commanders and command cards in 2210 make for an enjoyable enough game, that playing without them is entirely unappealing to me.  It was after playing a lot of this game and Settlers of Catan that I was introduced to the wider world of board games.

This is a dramatic improvement over the good old Risk, with lots of strategical, tactical, and tough decision making possibilities.

The rules are easy to pick up, especially for those who have played regular Risk. The components are nice and well designed and the game mechanics are clean and straight forward. The player down time is still there, but then again it is nice to be able to take periodic beer or pretzels breaks during certain games.

I very much enjoyed this game. It still feels like Risk, but has some much needed improvements. For starters, there are only 5 rounds which means that a game can be finished in 3 hours or less and its not neccessary for people to be eliminated. More importantly, the board has been revamped to include water and space zones, and command cards have been added to the mix. These two factors serve to make the game much more strategic and much less predictable than basic Risk. No more games where everyone runs for Australia !!

Very good game, but terrible turn angst.  You may wait ~45 min on a 5 player game.  Hard to come up with winning strategy vs. good players as, in a way, you seem to be a leaf in a hurricane.  If other people are on the ball they will whittle you back down quickly as you try to gain power.  I would have scored this higher after playing just a few times, but after a lot of play, I really must say that, although pretty fun, I can't really see where one can come up with a winning strategy that will make you a "better" player than the next guy.  One card in this game can so easily throw off your strategy.

takes too long even with 5 turn rule, adds more things to buy from risk, but does not have a unique touch to it, more of an evolution than a revolution

Played it recently and it was terrible. The game went for almost 5 hours. There was four players. All we managed to do was shift our army position. Playing like that is boring and player elimination is also boring.

Solution? Play Nexus Ops. Victory points end the game much better than elimination or year rule.

It works and is fun.  Its main improvements over regular Risk are
- adding more low value territories so that everyone can have an "Australia"
- fixing the game length to 5 turns and scoring on "income" plus some hidden victory points
- adding an economy to the game, in which you earn money equal to reinforcement allowance, and can spend it on cards and leaders (which interact in interesting ways).

It tends to restrict conflict (which is an improvement) - some will fight over water, some over the moon etc.  It plays a little slowly, and would probably be improved by buying cards after your turn just to help the flow.  Substantially more complex than regular Risk.

Fixes most, if not all, of the issues I have with the classic game of RISK. The map feels a lot more flexible and balanced. The five turn limit prevents games from dragging on forever and the bidding for turn order mechanic makes the turn limit work. The turn limit also provides for a much more active and aggressive game, which is great. The commanders and command cards are fun to use!

Risk on crack. I grew up playing Risk a few times and wish I could have found people to play it. Then I get this and run into the same situation from time to time. Not really into it like I was before ever since I got TI3 and Starcraft, but there's still some love for it.

Unfortunately I haven't played this in a long time because the group I played with has scattered. I wish I was able to play it more often. I think this is best played with gamers who can play very competitively without worrying about hurting feelings or egos. The variety of tactics and play styles you'll see, especially in five player games, means you'll always have to think on your feet. A solid strategy you used to win prior could get you wiped off the map in turn 1 (yes, it's happened to me) if you fight today's war with yesterdays tactics. I think the different commanders, command cards, the devestated territories, and the addition of the moon and sea territories are fantastic. The replayability is amazing, especially if you play 4 or 5 player games and can play with one or two different people each game. I think the time limit of 5 rounds is a great idea and makes it a necessity to have a flexible plan and to think long term about your situation. It's fun to see how alliances build and then falter as doubt and treachery alter the course of history. Definately a top game with the right type of players and the right number of people.

"To the moon baby!"  That's what you'll be saying after you buy your first space commander.  After that you'll soon be crushed on Earth, and shortly after your space empire will be attacked on all sides.  Should have gone twenty leagues under the sea instead...

Doesn't make sense?  Well, basically if you're looking for a new spin on Risk, I recommend this one.  You also have a turn limit, so the game has an ending in sight.

meh...  It's Risk with more devastating mechanics, and more back-doors for people to escape to or attack from.  This one seems a bit chaotic and the fun I get out of it doesn't warrant 3+ hours.   Still, if I'm forced to play Risk, this is the only one I wont bitch about playing.

Okay conquest game game that is let down by the incredibly long play time!

The command cards do allow some excitement though the Nuclear Commander's cards are way to costly for what they do.

Still heavily luck driven and a wee bit finicky, but at the same time it has a wonderful simplicity (for a war game) and allows many opportunities to mitigate the chaos.

RATING: 7
It happened again - I played a version of Risk that I actually [i]want[/i] to play again.  The map updates really change the dynamic and the elimination of the ever-increasing cards-for-dudes mechanic makes for a much more interesting game.  I think the commanders and corresponding decks are smart, but i would have liked less duplication across the various decks - the Land, Naval, and Space decks are basically all the same.  Otherwise, I think this is about as good as Risk gets.

RATING: 7
A definite improvement over classic Risk - pretty much all the stale (and sometimes unbalanced) strategies and tactics of the original game are much less viable. The random map variations are a great touch, injecting a bit of freshness into each game, and the command cards do a great job of spicing up proceedings and throwing curveballs - especially to unsuspecting players used to classic Risk :)

Despite this, I'm selling this game as it never clicked with the other players I've played it with as much as it did with me. I have friends who own classic Risk and the Lord of the Rings edition, so I don't necessarily have to give up on the Risk experience completely despite no longer owning any of them myself.

This had the makings of a really, really fun take on Risk, but something's not quite there. The game just seems to have a "not playtested enough" quality to it, from the half-baked (but very nice!) attempt to incorporate the moon and space, some seemingly overpowered cards (Ceasefire) and the tiresome bid for turn order at the end. This is a compression of Risk, compressing many, many decisions into 5 total turns, and I can't help thinking they compressed too much. I'd like to see this be extended (i.e. more turns for the game) into a full-fledged classic Risk-like "wargame", while the new Risk 2008 takes on the "compressed Risk" role.

This game really looked interesting.  As someone who actually likes the original Risk, I had great expectations from this.  However, for the most part, the extra chrome is just that -- extra chrome.

Risk that doesn't take three days.  The cards add quite a number of meaningful decisions and all the extra areas(sea and moon) allow for several routes of attack or areas to establish a base.  5 rounds and done with some truly epic conflicts in the last 2 turns looking for the win.  Lots of fun with dudes on a map.

Not bad, a definate improvement on Risk.  The only problem seems to be the downtime.  If you play with quick, decisive players I think this game would be quite fun.  If you play with people that ponder each and every move at length, like I often do, then you're gonna have loads of downtime.

There isn't too much to say beyond this just doesn't get played.  It is a longer game and takes some setup, so that leads to it not being brought out much.

From my memory it is a fun take on risk, it definitely helps eliminate some of the problems by the game ending at a certain number of turns.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
a very good "tactical" variant of the new risk. many have said that it is more tactical than risk godstorm, requiring more advanced strategy planning. i agree. but theme-wise, the futuristic world-war III scenerio does little for me, i much prefer the greek mythological theme in godstorm. somehow, my first game of 2210 left me still in dazed from the nuclear warfare. there was so much happening, it can be hard to keep track of what is going on and who is really in the lead. it's a good game, nonetheless. also, i think the rules and gameplay is much easier to grasp in 2210 (but maybe this is because many of the features can be found in godstorm which i played quite a few times before). we played with 7 players with two teams having partners. i paired up with my wife for the first time, and it was great. She kept me from making "wipe-everyone out" mistakes, many times. she is very good at stepping back and looking at the whole situation from fresh perspective. i guess it comes with her job as a PR consultant. hee! hee!

Risk 2210 combines the elements of strategy with the randomness of dice rolls, and wraps a game up in 3 1/2 hours.  Bonus points for the fact that my wife and my best friend's wife (admittedly non-gamers) definitely enjoy a game.  Just remember that when Djibouti changes hands, you have to yell "Oh God! Not Djibouti!" My rating on this would probably be less if I wasn't the winner more often than not -- on a regular scale I would probably peg this more around 7.5.
---
My rating on this has dropped considerably because in light of so many better games out there, I cannot see myself playing this one often.  A friend of mine from school keeps talking about getting together to play Risk, so this would be something that I could play with him, but for the sake of brevity, my regular game group would rather not play this anymore, and I'm inclined to agree.
---
For my first foray into Risk 2210 in two years, since my discovery of other boardgaming, my rating in this one has dropped off significantly.  I think the game still has merit, but there is so much potential for analysis paralysis that makes the game drag so much, as well as individual downtime for each player.  By my estimates, each player takes an average of 10 minutes per turn, which means 40 minutes per year, and thereby 200 minutes for a game... I could play a lot more and better games in 3 hours 20 minutes.  I have exited the cave, and I realize that the shadows therein are not reality.

Played once and my two opponents hated it, which marred my experience.  I want to try again as I see quite a bit of promise.  Update:  the five year limit fixes one of the main problems with classic Risk, namely, the lengthy later rounds brought about by huge bonuses for cards.  Bidding for turn order is quite interesting, and there are now more routes to hard to reach territories.  The game does take a while, although the downtime is usually still interesting since you get to see what your opponent have been planning and you are often involved defensively.  My main issue is the cards.  My first turn, I planned a border attack and loaded up my reserves, only to have a cease fire card played on me.  Then, on my final turn, I was attempting to sweep through a few countries and had a card played on me where I lost half my armies there.  Of course, you can theoreticaly attempt to plan for these scenarios, but the cards can engender some frustration and sway the game a little too much, especially for such a long game.  Otherwise, a fine addition to the Risk canon.

Any lovers of risk will almost suredly like this game. It has three defining traits. The first is that it solves most of the problem with the old risk including undefined and thus indefinate gameplay. It is one of those remakes where you can play with either the new rules or the old rules. And lastly it has a whole crap load of new features, territories, function, and what not to really spice up the gameplay.

Adds a lot of chrome, which can be nice, but also gives the game much more downtime. There are only five turns, but players can do so much in a turn that doesn't involve other players (buying cards, reading them, deciding how and when to play them) that it certainly feels a lot longer than vanilla Risk. That could take several hours as well, but at least most individual turns are blisfully short.

Best Risk re-skin. Addition of space and ocean theaters creates new strategies (no more turtling in Australia). Command cards add fun, unpredictability, and catch-up mechanism. Limited number of rounds means games are enjoyable and reasonable length. If you only want one Risk, this is it.

Best risk I've played. Expands upon the leader pieces with the commanders and a deck of cards only they can play.  Also includes underwater and moon map locations for added novelty and strategy.  

The 5 turn limit makes this a race for the victory points which cuts down on the length of the game which is a good thing.

RATING: 5
I never thought much of original Risk; but this version is MUCH better, with many more options.  The limited game length is a very good thing (I think the estimate on this site of 6 hours is way too long...I played my first game in 2 or so.)  The one problem is that it seems like the player who goes last on the last turn has a HUGE advantage.

This variant of Risk is better than the original on all fronts. The energy & bidding for turns makes the game a lot more interesting, and the commanders and accompanying cards are fun.

Hands down the best Risk I've played yet.  We got through a 4-player game in about 2 hours.  It was tense and strategic which is not something I can say about any other Risk version.

Not the greatest war game ever made, but it is a MASSIVE improvement over the original RISK. Not that that's saying much. It was fun before I knew there were better games out there. Now you couldn't pay me to play it. The one thing I will note is that people seem to get uncharacteristically angry when playing this game. It just seems to invite more competitiveness than even other new variants of RISK like Godstorm.

I went into the game with trepidation as in the end it really is still a dice fest.  After reading the rules my concerns centered around all the cards and how powerful they would be in changing the face of the game and those concerns ended up being justified.  Some may argue that some skill will mean you can make a good showing, but if armageddon occurs on the fifth turn the whole game gets reset and more than likely goes to the person who gets to go fourth.  If it were a one hour game that is acceptable.  But investing three hours to armageddon and the last player who goes in the turn...

Did I enjoy playing?  Yes.  Would being a good player make ANY difference in winning?  No way.

Solves the original Risk's problem of never ending games, but introduces a new one. Whoever has the last turn in the game knows he can just go all-in, risking everything, since no one can get back at him. However, the new elements of bidding, currency, and leaders with special powers add a bit more strategy to the game, and make it worth playing.

By adding cards, money, characters, variable turn order, and a round limit, Risk 2210 A.D. is a gallant attempt to modernize the original.  But these changes don't address the fundamental weaknesses of Risk:  primitive gameplay, inordinate dice throwing, player elimination, and heavy downtime.

An early Risk variant, 2210 shows it's age... compared to more recent ones, it's rather clunky. It has a turn limit, which I hate, but can't recommend ignoring because it takes WAY too long to get a total conquest victory... there are just too many options a losing player can resort to as a memes of stalling their defeat. Avoid. There are just so many better Risks out there at this point.

If you love Risk, you'll definitely love Risk 2210.  Although you can play classic Risk on this version, be forewarned that this latest version plays quite differently (it took us two tries to iron out the rules).

New components, new things to conquer, but still Risk at it's core.  Now it just takes longer to set-up, long to explain to new players, and longer to play.  I DO like all those little pieces though...

A nice update to a classic. The inclusion of extra territories and randomization due to 'Nuclear War' is really nice.

(+~60 Plays before I started counting)

This game was the favorite of my group from 2003 to 2009. Light but with enough strategy to keep you interested and thus allow you to focus on it's main "mechanic": Diplomacy.
It drags too long though so it loses ground to shorter games... I wish it had a more modern combat system and not dice... (not beacause they add a luck element... when you throw dice 150-300 times per game you cannot count on luck... but it still seems lame.)

The game is replete with solid little additions, such as a time limit, varied "commanders" which allow you to fight in different terrain types, and different kinds of "command cards" which can swing the balance in your favor.  A very simple wargame that can suck you in quickly.

There seems to be a bias against Risk-branded games in the hobby game community, and perhaps for good reason.  If you enjoy Risk though, as I do, and are looking for the next step, you can't go wrong with this game.  It is a souped-up version of Risk that has military commanders with dedicated command cards, nuclear weapons, and it allows you to conquer the freakin' moon.  Adding the energy points and the command cards really open this game up and transforms classic Risk into a fantastic strategy game where players can make interesting tactical decisions instead of just rolling dice.  I have even had friends that hated Risk enjoy this game.  This is one of those games that I always want to play, but I have a hard time finding people to play it with.  Playing it is a rather large commitment, but it is one that I feel is worth it.

4 plays: Great game compared to normal Risk. There's nothing like pulling out the classic Risk the odd day, but Risk 2210 adds enough 'much needed' strategy that I would have no problem playing 2210 on a game night.

Fixes *some* of the inherent issues in Risk and makes for a more balanced game.  Although, this is not a game I plan on owning or playing very much in the future.

This is one of the gateways for our gaming group that brought out whole group from playing no games into game geeks.  While the quality of the gameplay has been surpassed by recent titles we have acquired, this game does have a very good trait in that allows for great "stories" to be made during gameplay.  Like the 1 defender who survives an attacking force of 20.  Or the time the defender held the radar jam card in his hand to hold off the last turn onslaught totally turning the tide of the game.  Or the time when one player went to the moon on the first turn and abandoned earth entirely to buy all of the nuke cards and rain down destruction from above.  I don't have much desire to play again but the memories are fond and still frequently mentioned.  May play again a few more times for nostalgia purposes.

However from a pure gameplay perspective I much prefer and recommend Nexus Ops for a similar feel game that is much more balanced and better implemented.

RATING: 5.5
Risk 2210 A.D. has a lot of good things going for it. The miniatures used are really awesome, especially the commanders. It adds really cool cards that have neat artwork. It even expands map to include the moon and underwater territories. The biggest upgrade might be the turn limitation to "decrease" playing time. However good all this may be though, there are so many fundamentally "not fun" things about risk to me. The biggest problem is that it's just a massive dice rolling fest. This makes turns extremely drawn out (it's super difficult to even limit to 7 minute turns). I hate the blind auction to see who goes first (because losers lose their coins). And even with limited turns per game, the game still lasts way too long. I also hate the "king building" and thus "everybody attack that guy" element to the game. I must be honest though. I have fun while playing it, even with these complaints. I just have a lot more fun playing other games. Thus the 5.5.

Surprisingly NOT horrible, especially considering its namesake.  Adds enough stuff to the game to make it interesting.  Leaders and cards both needed additions.  Still plods along at times.  If your friends love Risk, this is a good next step.

An epic game. With the right group, you will have games that you remember forever. Games take about 3-4 hours, but if you really get into character and act like you want to own the world (and the moon!) this game can be loads of fun.

Big box edition.

Plays before 2010 are from my log of Risk 2210 games played with my "league" at BYU.

Risk is one of those passe games that I play because many of my friends don't go in for the high-strategy games that I prefer. It is a half-way house for us. It starts off well enough, but unfortunately over time the luck of the dice and the ridiculous numbers of reinforcements that start coming out annoy me. The special rules for 2210 counter the silliness to some degree.

Classic wargame that got me into the hobby. Played this one to death for years and would happily play any time.

Great mix of mechanical play and negotiations, with both being critical to success. The betrayals and backstabbing can be hilarious, dont play with your partner unless you want to sleep on the couch!

Still stands the test of time, even with more modern games coming out all.

Risk 2210 A.D. is Risk on nuclear steroids. A game that doesn't hit the table as often as it deserves. Mostly due to lack of opponents. When ever I get the chance to play multiplayer we usually go for something a bit more fresh. At one point I was close to trading it away, but then I reconsidered because after all it's not a bad game and I think it's pretty fun to play. In addition the low complexity makes it a good game to play with non gamers. I've made a mental note that I need to get it to the table more often in the future. Probably wont happen, but I like to have the option at least...

Risk 2210 A.D. is yet another entry in the long series of Risk  variants. Set in the not-so-distant future, battles are now fought by machines of destruction, known as MODS, for short. Human commanders still lead these mechanized troops, but these commanders each have special powers and abilities. These come into play via the use of Command cards, which add a new dimension to the game. Now, the battle is not just for the continents, but the sea and moon are also battlegrounds.

Although much has been added, the basic flavor of the game is still Risk. One welcome change is the institution of a five-turn game limit, which allows the game to play to completion in about three hours. Further, players must also factor in economics in the form of energy. This energy is used to purchase Command cards, bid for Turn Order, and hire new commanders. There is much more strategy and planning involved in this new version, but it should still appeal to the classic Risk fans.

Among the plethora of Risk variants that have been released over the past few years, Risk 2210 is one of my favorites. Most of the elements of the classic game are still here, but a few slight tweaks to gameplay and a couple of exciting new features deliver a far better game than the crusty old pseudo-Napoleonic original.

What is so much better? For starters, the board changes every play. The map is fixed, but at the start of every game you randomly nuke a few territories. These territories are then considered impassable for the entire game. While this seems like a relatively minor change, it often adds interesting choke points to what formerly were wide open areas in previous editions of the game. The addition of card play to the mix also ratchets things up a notch, adding interesting effects and offering additional ways to manipulate your armies.

There is also a very intriguing cold war aspect to the cards, as holding nuclear weapons cards gives you a decisive edge when working out alliances. Keeping them in your hands is dangerous though, as there is a card in the deck that can force everyone at the table to play their nukes all at once. Why would anyone want that? Simple...There is a new bonus territory in Risk 2210, the moon. It's a great place to watch the fireworks and an even better place to stage an invasion when the dust clears.

The only flaw I see in the game is the artificially imposed time limit. The game ends after exactly five turns and while I appreciate knowing the game won't carry on endlessly...It also means that going last on the final turn of the game is a huge advantage. It allows you to attack recklessly and over extend without fear of counterattack. This doesn't necessarily ruin the game, since turn order is one of the things that can be manipulated by the players. I just wish it was handled a little more elegantly.

Still, I'm pretty sure that one day this will be looked back on as an Ameritrash classic and it will probably cost a fortune on E-bay. I'm glad I got mine early...

The underwater colonies, moon map, commanders and random irradiated territories mix up the standard Risk game, which is normally pretty predictable. More options make this a lot more enjoyable than the classic. It still stands by the old Risk tradition of players possibly being eliminated hours before the game actually ends, though, so I don't feel like bringing it out too often.

My favorite Risk game to date.  I love the possibilities though house rules are needed to help balance the game.  With 3 players, you might want to add a &quot;neutral&quot; player and providing that doesn&#039;t attack but has 2 or 3 armies to defend the territory from the 3 human players.

I've only played this game twice, the first time we scoffed at the turn limit and finally quit about 15 hours later with the game still unresolved.  The second time I played with some more experienced players and it was good fun.  Having the last turn is a little too powerful.  It works alright since you can plan ahead to make a bid for it.  But then the game becomes about bidding for the last turn rather than conquering the world, and that's not as much fun.

This is my favourite version of Risk and it has most of the innovations seen in other kinds of risk.  You have space stations that work as fortresses but also let you explore an entirely separate moon station.  You have leaders who provide bonuses during play but also let you buy cards from their corresponding decks, which sometimes give you objectives or other fun bonuses.  You have turn limit and a turn order bidding mechanic that turn limits make necessary.  If you've enjoyed Risk in the past but are starting to find it a bit boring, play this.

Risk ligth 5 rounds only so it ends and it should be played quickly even though some people doesnt realize this.
Also I believe that this endgame pointscounting induced players to play to tigth and hording energy and troops in order to secure corrent place for the last round. Its seldom worth it to conquer man areas from opposition. Another drawback is the lack of really hurtful cards with only one landtrap, and the number of jams are a bit to many for them to be really appriciated. You always got one or two extra of them for the last round when it really matters.
I want to play it again with cumulative pointcounting for all rounds so people can bloom at any round.

If you like Risk, you'll love this one. If you hate Risk, try it. The dice are still there, but no endless battles. And dice in itself should not be the issue. Avalon Hill published tons of great wargames in which battles are decided by dice.
Good about Risk 2210:
- 2-5 players
- limited to 5 rounds, 2-3 hours!
- so no endless buildups or throwing dice
- continious attacking / interacting
- goodlooking board and pieces
- devastation markers (4 countries are impassable) every game different
- additions (5 type commanders, mission cards, energy tokens) make the game somewhat more complex and give it more variation: the concept of buying resources adds an economic perspective
- everybody has the same objective: world domination
- better setup, because you can choose the countries you want one at a time, and there is no upper limit to the number of armies in one country.

Solves a number of the problems associated with Risk including bottlenecking and the dumbass, set collection, I-win card trade-ins. Randomness is really only a marginal problem; players forgoing any of the types of cards have to expect to be hit hard by them (i.e. Invade Earth, Armageddon, Death Traps + Stealth Mods), somewhat mitigating the I-got-gayed factor based on the fact you knew it was coming. Then again, there are just some games where the terrain deck or the dice are not your friend, and the length of the game isn't exactly conducive to a quick, painless death for the shafted.

Eclipsed somewhat by all the licsenced versions, this was the first real "gamers" risk. Those who started with all the Star Wars versions going back to this may not find that much new, but it's still pretty fresh. Great Sci-fi theme; Multiple power decks that have to be "unlocked" by purchasing certian leaders; Certain attacking powers that must also be "unlocked" (water attacks); A seperate moon board that has to be "land rushed"; and a five turn limit. Since the liscened versions are mostly OOP now, this may be your best bet for a harder risk.

Quite enjoyable. Much more interesting than original Risk. Love the addition of leaders and the moon. I'm not a wargamer, but I'll still play this one. Yes it's more simplistic with only one type of unit (compared to Axis & Allies or others), but that's why I enjoy it too.

Clearly my favorite of all the Risk variants. The ocean lane territories and the moon add so much to the game, as do the Leader cards. The short time frame forces action. Can still go on a bit long, and it's possible to be elimiated before you even get your first turn -- which are problematic. But it certainly fills a niche, and fills it well.

Well thought out Risk variation.  Energy being such an important in commodity in this futuristic setting worked perfectly.  The game builds through the 5 turns well with having to spend energy to be able to make it to water territories and the moon.

The cards add some more variables but aren't too powerful or out of balance like the Risk variation Godstorm.  The map is only a small variations from original Risk but the variations are good and I think it works better than most versions that have heavy focus on a new map.

Not a fan of Risk, a game I put aside when I graduated high school and was introduced to Dune and Civilization.  But, 2210 I played when it first came out and enjoyed much more.

Finally bought it and played again and consider it a great alternative to brain-busters to roll dice, bomb each other and relax a bit.

A very nice version of Risk that corrects many of the problems of the classic game, such as length and limited expansion routes. The cards add some nice variability and flavour, and also serve as balancing factors. They can be a little powerful sometimes; one suggestion is to limit the hands to four instead of five. Turn order is very important, especially on the last turn; a slight drawback, but you bid for it so there is some control.

UPDATE: Revised Risk seems to hit it on the head a tad better, with its shorter play time.

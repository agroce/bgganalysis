An essential follow-up for experienced One Night Ultimate Werewolfers. The game-to-game variety and chaos is excellent. Gives numpties like me more outs... or more ways to hang ourselves ;)

Really like thematic twists in this one as opposed to Werewolf or Vampire, and the fact this can now be combined with those (and Daybreak) in almost limitless combinations of characters means that this has an infinite replay value, especially with its super short play time.

After more plays it's starting to grow on me. There are random events that happen in this version keeping everyone alert, some events make sense and some are just random and chaotic. Characters seem good so far. Looking forward to more plays.

Unpredictability of the aliens can make the game too random, especially for new players, but even for experienced ones.

Some mental gymnastics required to figure out how the final instructions affect the players roles. Breaks the easy flow of the original.

I really like the One Night Ultimate series. Aliens has a cool twist. I'd like to play Aliens vs Werewolves but haven't had enough people for it. One negative: I'm quite annoyed that I can't get the unlocked app because I missed the KS.

RATING: 7
Still getting used to the new roles and ripples. I love the idea of the mortician in particular. The synthetic alien is clever, but several of our games have really broken as a result in the low player counts. 

Right now, I am hesitant to recommend it as a stand alone, but there are some fun roles to add to the game otherwise.

I like that the app is more interactive in this version. The variable new powers and space time continuum ripples are fun and add variety. I think the player numbers add new stuff without being as cumbersome as the tiles from Vampire, but the new effects aren't as interesting as the ones in Vampire. I don't think it works as a standalone game, there's not enough interesting villager roles, but it's good as an expansion. I still prefer Vampire as a first expansion though, but it is more complex than Alien.

The formula doesn't change much with this ONU installment, but it's proven to work. I highly suggest this game if you prefer more randomness. If you don't like the randomness in Wereworlf-type games, then skip it. 

For what it's worth, though, this one produces a lot of laughs and, in my opinion, offers a lot more replay value. Superb party game.

While this version is as light as the original, it's also more random. It's a nice way to shake up the formula, but can disrupt information to a greater degree, leaving less definitive information in a game which already makes clues scarce.

RATING: 4
I enjoy the One Night Ultimate Werewolf and Daybreak games, but this game goes into areas that the system wasn't designed to do.

Much like One Night Ultimate Vampire, there are simply too many variables to keep track of to make any sort of deductive guesses.  With the roles always changing every game, the game boils down to memorization since each role plays slightly different each game.  One of the roles even requires a player to interact with the app, which makes no sense.  I prefer the more straightforward ONUW games over this.

RATING: 4
I don't like the direction Alien took this franchise. The base game is great. Daybreak is also great. Vampire was so so but at least worked pretty well. Alien I find to be much worse--all the variable effects and random elements create a game with far more zany things occuring but with a much greater range of outcomes it makes deducing anything pretty impossible. For this reason this one largely removes the skill to be found in ONUW and therefore it doesn't offer me gameplay that I'd find preferable to ONuW in almost any circumstance. At the very least there are a few roles that integrate with the others games pretty well, but outside of those I likely won't be playing this again. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Total fail among my non-gamer friends.

The game has too many rules for non-gamers, but no depth at all for gamers. So this game will probably never get played again.

Way too complex and way too random.  I normally love the One Night collection of games, but this just pushed the randomness and complexity too far to be enjoyable.  You shouldn't be able to get into arguments as to who won or didn't, and that happened way too often with this game.

A lot of the roles have random effects, and remembering what they all did that round is a huge pain. I don't recommend playing this unless with a bunch of very experienced One Night players.

However, as an expansion for One Night Werewolf, it's pretty good. Some of the roles (Mortician, Blob, Leader) work very well with the original game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

App does great job of narrating action. A number of roles to remember and keep straight, so not a great introduction to the social deduction genre. Needs buy in and participation from players or will fall flat.

It's good, though like every other One Night Release, you have to pick through the crap to get to the good stuff.  Some of the new roles are creative and interesting, and the app randomness can be pretty great.

Tip: don't ever play a game that tells some players to "turn around". This is one of the worst and awkward mechanics I've ever experienced in a table top game. This might be fun for 8 year olds, but otherwise stay far away.

More weirdly constrained stuff going on than ONUW. I'm not proficient enough at this genre to do information management on top of the fact that the (required for this version) app is now publicly constraining certain bits of information that have to be played around.

This is substantially the same as [thing=147949][/thing], which I am lukewarm about.  Alien adds some randomness to the game by occasionally having a random person swap or look at cards.  It also relies more on the app by having some roles have to touch it or answer questions during the game.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.

It also adds a whole bunch of new roles, some of which are very good.  There are a couple of improved Tanner variants that made for some amusing interactions.  I think the overall game is probably worse than the original, but some of the roles are worth incorporating.

A beautiful bidding euro. Nothing innovative, but nothing bad either. Works well and it is a strategic family game. Its rank should be a lot higher! it is an injustice for this game to be at rank 2500. I would put it around 700.

Yuck!  This game has too much blind bidding; in fact, blind bidding is almost the only thing you do in this game.  You have a limited idea of how valuable something is to your opponents, but usually your bids are just wild guesses in which you hope for the best.  I'm fine with never playing this game again.

I think this game was probably better back when it was released, but hasn't held up very well with time.   The blind bidding makes for a fairly random play, and the decisions, while present, are repetitive and uninteresting.

RATING: 4
I'm not a huge fan of blind bidding and in this one you're not just blind bidding, but you're often blind bidding on 6 separate auctions simultaneously!  Talk about total crapshoot guesswork!

Granted, there are a few ways to mitigate the randomness of the blind bidding.  There are auctions spaces that allow you extra points to your bid and allow to to upgrade your hand of cards to bid with, giving you better chances in later rounds.

However, you still have to win a blind bid to get any of these things, and with 6 separate auctions, which ones to go after in any given round seems like complete guesswork.  There were several times I went heavily after something, only to find out that two other players went in even more heavily, meaning I just used some of my best cards in the round for nothing.  If this happens a few times, it takes you completely out of the running.  I'm just not a fan of games where a few unfortunate guesses completely takes a player out of it.

The redeeming factors are that the games artwork is pretty awesome, and the entire game plays in about a half hour.  These two pluses aren't enough to make me likely to consider playing it much again though.

Chocolatl caught my attention because of the blind bidding mechanics. I usually like games featuring them, and make a point of trying them out whenever I have the opportunity. In Chocolatl's case I was spurred on by the chosen subject (the holy drink of the Aztecs) and the fact that a cursory reading of the rules did not cause my interest in this title to wane much. The game itself is a fairly involved yet quick succession of several 'minigames', all of which involve blind bidding. There's a blind bid for the tiebraker figure, a blind bid for random points (determined by dice), a blind bid for a fixed amount of points (although the amount goes down as the game progresses), a blind bid for swapping out weak bidding cards for stronger ones, and so forth. All these games are very short and very understandable and as a result help the game light. In a final twist the way you bid can change as well, depending on the position of the first player on the scoring track at the beginning of a new round: bids can be performed on a per minigame-basis, on a per round-basis, or something in between. In total: fairly involved as I already wrote, but still very accessible. 

As to how the game plays and works out... There's some tough questions to be answered here. After my first game I felt there were winning strategies in this game (for example discard 0, focus on mini-games 2 and 5 as long as there are many points to be had, grab the die from mini-game 3, and grab any high card from mini-game 6, ignore mini-game 4 completely) but after a second game, where I applied the above idea, I was beaten by a terrible margin. You stretch yourself too thinly for this to work. I have since refined my ideas and focus more on where good points or bidding power are to be had, I have even swapped out the initial 0 for the 12, and I have either won or come very close to winning in all cases. 

There's a few ifs and buts, though. The players I play against are not particularly good, which allows me to grab good spots very easily and sometimes nearly uncontestedly. Those players will be left somewhere in the dust; with any luck they will attain about half the points I manage. The problem is that once I start bagging good cards and bid enhancers, I will be harder to catch and likely cement my lead. In that regard the game is no fun for those trailing players. [i]But[/i] if everyone is equally shrewd, then I suspect the game will turn into something quite chaotic and uncontrollable, where what you consider to be good bids turn out to be worthless against the bids put in by other players. I'm not sure how that affects playing pleasure.

So returning to the question I posed myself initially: Is it a good game? I think it's a bit better then when I first encoutered it, but I'm still not sure about its long-term potential. I wish I had some strong players to play against...

[b]Update[/b] Two lucky games in which my opponents were aware of the power of certain board areas cemented my view that the game indeed becomes very chaotic. Unpleasantly so, in fact, since very small bidding power deltas can lead to serious player state differences (bidding power, Quetzalcoatl-figurines, &Delta;VPs, etc.). It is often completely impossible to predict how things will turn out then, so the important I think that you think that I think-mechanism is trampled to hell and back. With a heavy heart I conclude that the game is really not that good: it's too involved for its own good to play to win, and is really just about enjoying a wild ride. A ride given a nice artistic execution... but no more than that. Downgraded the rate by one point.

I'd probably rate this more highly if I enjoyed bidding games more.

There are are six areas on the board where you can bid either on points or ways to improve your prospects of winning future bids.  The bidding mechanism and points available vary throughout the game and you need to adapt to this as well as outguessing your opponents.  The game is pretty and the components well made but the theme is pasted on.

RATING: 4
For a blind bidding game to make an interesting game, the players should have some means of predicting what the other players might be interested in, and there should be incentives for players not all going for the same things. It's also quite desirable to not have miniscule bidding differentials result in a huge differnce in score.
Neither of these is true for Chocolatl, unfortunately, and since the game is literally just a sequence of blind bids of various kinds , it is quite chaotic and winning doesn't feel like the result of playing well but of having better luck with a few key bids.

RATING: 5
Auctioning game that uses three auctioning mechanisms where one suffices, and offers things up for auction which are of uneven values and unrelated to the theme. It's as random as Sneaks & Snitches, but where S&S plays in 20 minutes, this game takes 90 minutes to 2 hours. Far too long for what it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Extremely differential bidding game. If there is a bidding mechanism known to man - it certainly is in this game. Blind bidding, open bidding, one-by-one card bidding - choose what you like. It's rather not very thematic (that's why I sold it) but it's still very pleasant and tense. The artwork is nice so it makes it easier to forget about the separation of theme and mechanics.

Definitely worth playing.

Fun simultaneous auction game. On some turns you have to program your whole auctions of the round, sometimes is just auction per auction (depending on where the leader’s scoring pawn is –a nice touch). 

I’m just afraid the “get the extra-cards” strategy will systematically prevail –have to play more to make sure.

For such a simple game Chocolatl has overly fiddly rules and one of the three different blind bidding mechanisms slows the game down without adding any depth or fun. Still a fun enough game and one of the bidding mechanisms (one card open then one card blind) is quite clever and hopefully gets copied to other games.

Not bad. The "theme" is thinner than in 90% of the non-abstract Knizias. The mechanism is okay. Planning is almost impossible, with an emphasis on "almost". Not a bad game by any means, and also it looks good but it's just too luck-dependent for my taste.

Semplice (nelle spiegazioni) ma tuttaltro che banale (strategia molto fine). Lo trovo divertente perché, oltre ad essere abbastanza veloce, miscela strategia a fortuna, intuito a programmazione. Il gioco verte tutto su continue aste. Il tabellone è diviso in 7 aree: 6 con benefit che vengono aggiudicati a seguito di altrettante aste che si ripeteranno per i 7 turni di gioco; l'ultima area verrà svelata solo alla fine e assegnerà ulteriori punti vittoria. Ci rigioco spesso e molto volentieri.

We played this at a small game fair recently.  It was very quick to learn, but highly repetitive.  This made it dull and would greatly limit the replayability.  It could be slightly interesting for kids that are working on basic math skills.  Otherwise, there is no challenge or anything to grab you.

The artwork was pleasant and colorful.

Pure random and chaos in a very beautiful game, specially the front box. It's a petty that I don't like the game a bit more because I really really love the front cover. The theme is simple and euroish, the components are fair enough but the game play is poor. Playing each pair of cards with criteria can signify, using the same care, two different things: a great accomplishment or a total waste! Pure randomness in a otherwise beautiful design.

Another great light-medium design from Gunther Burkhardt.  This game couldn't be much simpler in design and yet it evokes a lot of decisions.  There's so much balance to consider that what should be simple choice turns into brain-burning agony.  A big part of the game is playing the tie-breakers which adds a great layer to the decision tree.  It's so delightful that I can't wait to play it again.

It's a 7.5 for now, but I think once I get more plays it will go up to an 8 or 8.5.  Not truly great, but really quite good.

Sadly, I traded this one away in the Labor of Love Math Trade.

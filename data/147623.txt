GAME: Friese's Landlord
RANK: 2604
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love this! It's a really mean card game, with a wicked sense of humour, and fantastic artwork. There are a lot of rules for each card, which makes it hard to pick up and play without first making yourself familiar with all the interactions, but it's simple stuff once you get going. There is little strategy, but loads of great take-that moments. I think this would make a perfect warm up for a game of Friese's Funny Friends, or Fearsome Floors, both of which share the whimsical sense of humour featured here. Great stuff.

For the angry, cattily, disgusting and cowardly players. I only would love to see an other game-end option! Not only  played to the last concealed card, instead to the first player, who fulfill to earn f.e. 40 or 50 Friese-coins, depending on the number of players.
Edit: 3 or 5 player aid-cards would have been nice to have.

RATING: 7.5
It might just be the Friese fanboy in me, but I really enjoyed this game, even though so many elements are ones that I should hate.  It plays relatively simply, with the complexity coming from how each individual card works.  I also have slight problems with how the police work.  We felt that one alibi or court card should suffice, and if they can't find their criminal once around then the trail is lost.  The take that of the game isn't even that egregious.  Just go with it, and don't worry when you inevitably get a fringe rule incorrect.  Just fix it in your next play.  Don't worry everyone will come back for more.

Great card game which is ultra high on interaction. 

You take on the role of a landlord that is building houses for tenants to live in, however you also get to demolish buildings (usually those belonging to another player), murder their tenants (and then try to dodge the police investigation) or put squatters into their buildings. A lot of fun. 

This one could be used as slightly longer filler.

Amazing artwork and box shape. Great theme and bits.
I really really wanted to like this one, but it was just a headache to play since I would forget the card rulings between plays.

It is the sort of game you get while in college and only have a few games to play while drinking.

Aggressive that-take game. I didn't mind the humor, like some of the reviewers had mentioned, and I may not mind the aggressive play either, if I were going into it expecting a ridiculous chaotic game. However, the people I played it with had an extreme, negative reaction, watching their apartments getting blown up and their tenants murdered or moved around—basically, watching their achievements torn down by each other and taking it rather personally—so I won't be holding on to this one. It's a bit of a mean slugfest, and you'll need people who enjoy that sort of thing for this game.

I generally loathe take-that card games, but this one is a treat!  It's highly thematic, and I love games where you build things, even when they are subject to destruction.  I own and enjoy the original version.  I didn't feel a need to get the new version, but I found it on discount, so I gave in.  The new roof rules should be used in the original edition, it's MUCH better.  Some of the tenants are different, but not enough to dramatically change the the feel of the original.  The murder cards still make this a bit dark for playing with younger kids, unfortunately, but it's good sick and twisted fun.  Always a good sign when I'm laughing even when I'm losing!

One hell of a crunchy, cut-throat game wrapped in cartoony outfit! Lots of cool nifty characters and even a short designer cameo, and on the flipside, enough "ammo" to drive the other players crazy :) Oh, it's card shuffle dependant, so make sure you do shuffle that big pile of cards really, really well... otherwise one unlucky player could suffer an endless chain of murders, demolitions, explosions, evacs, and so  on :) It's really hilarious and downright mean at the same time - make sure you're playing with people with both good sense of humours and nerves of steel! No question, a killer game - LOVE it!

I do really like this and many other games by Friedeman Friese. As always rather funny and fun to play. Maybe a bit too complicated to explain the rules to others, when you meet in a boardgame group. I choose to take out some of the cards, which are a bit complicated to understand and are not bringing so much into the game.

RATING: 4
One 5p game only, but (at least that player count) very, very chaotic, and not in a good way. You have very little control over what the others do to your position on their turns, and your set up can look radically different from the end of one of your turns to the start of the next. This makes it a turn-by-turn game of tactical opportinism, making the best if the cards you drew at the end f the previous turn and what pickings the others have left you.

At 5p, we eack only got 5-6 turns, which for a short, quick filer left me thinking it had barely got going when it ended.

Wining strategy: draw the 'rich client' cards, and police to protect them.

Very ho-hum for me.

The 5.9 average of the previous implementation far better reflects reality than the current average of 7.0 shortly after its release at Spiel 2013. This is a mediocre take-that card game in the vein of Chez Geek or Family Business, just Friese style. Stay behind, keep low profile and make a dash to win only close to game end. The winner is decided by other players' decisions on whom to bash, not by clever own play.

A light game about building apartments and tenanting them. An interesting double-use of cards for both building and effects. The bomb/murder cards make this game more twisted than a standard card game. Art is great, typical Friese style.

Sadly the card text is horrible. Every card has a clarification in the rulebook which could just have easily been printed on the card. WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST DO THAT?

Just draw and place cards without a strategy behind it, then draw again with all the earnings.
Others could use cards against the run-away leader, but ending in prison nets you 2$ that turn, while the bombed/assasinated player will get more money than that.

You are a Landlord and you can really screw with the other players, you can bomb their buildings, Murder their tenants, evict them, move them, put squatters that don't pay rent, etc, etc, etc... while you try to build your buildings and have the best paying tenants on them to get the most money...

I liked the game, it's fast and fun but you have to be aware that everyone will be trying to bring you down!

--- Preliminary thoughts ---
Humoristic mean game where you can attack others and build combos others will be able to destroy.

Very few strategy, just luck of the draw and hoping others won't destroy your combos. The gameplay is pure chaos, there are too many interactive cards and too few build cards.

Better in 1 vs 1.

Too long for such a light game.

Serious replayability issues. Once the game loses its freshness and the jokes make no more fun, it will never leave the shelf again.

Simpatico e veloce gioco con fortissima interazione e poca strategia. Il gioco si presta molto alla cagnara allo sfottò,. Gioco divertente ma altamente soggetto alla fortuna. Il valore aggiunto al gioco, che altrimenti sarebbe meno apprezzato, è la chiave ironica dell'ambientazione scherzosa e alcune carte azione di disturbo.

Rubbish. Pure chaos with no control whatsoever, with ridiculous direct attacks that can be targeted arbitrarily. The graphical design is also very bad, with some vague textual descriptions for the various events spelled out in the cards but never with enough detail so that one could actually figure out what the cards do without consulting the rulebook all the time. Especially for a "fun" game like this the components should be self-contained and rules maximally clear.

[thing=147623][/thing] is a weak title, an unexpected situation coming from Friese. There are good ideas here and there, mainly in the part of building, adjusting the demands of the tenants in order to gain more money and be more prepared.

However, there are simply too many attacks, which detracts a lot from the planning and choices made. It is possible to finish your turn with 2, 3 buildings with nicely placed people, only for the play return to you to find only devasted land - with no people paying, maybe an empty building and with you, the landlord, in jail for what someone else did.

With the dynamic of assembling the buildings, the positioning of tenants, the use of money to buy cards, [thing=147623][/thing] can pass the ideia of a strategic game, but is way more Munchkin than Caylus - you simply want to call to yourself the least amount of attention, try to receive less attacks, be somewhat prepared to receive unexpected guests, try desesperately to get some money in your turn, and truly don't expect that something you see in front of you will be there next turn.

It is simply too little and shallow to make the gameplay interesting. The art is quite neat, clever and well made; and there is a lot of cards and possibilities inside such a small and portable box. Therefore, it is a shame that, in the end, the game goes fully into a route of "take that", with some defense, but mostly out of your hand.

In two people, you have more turns and [thing=147623][/thing] gets better, as you do receive even more attacks, but have more time to rebuild and make money. In 4, 5 or 6, it is simply too chaotic, brutal and there is little to attract me to playing it. I don't recommend it.

A cardgame, with lots of interaction between the players. But you have to keep in mind, this is a mean cardgame. You don’t want to have crackers living in one of your apartments, so you’ll try to send them to one of the other landlords.  The graphics on the cards are fun, but there could have been more variation between the cards of the same kind (for example the cards of the hackers are all the same. It would have been more fun, if they were looking a bit different from eachother). The game itself is a bit overpriced for what you get. Nevertheless, a fun game, you should play if you got the opportunity.

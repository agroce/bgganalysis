Yay!  I can get rid of [b]Hermagor[/b] now!  My favorite part of that game is the core of this new game.  Very elegant and fun.  Maybe a little thinky towards the end, though.

RATING: 7
I was someone who liked the nasty auction/area control phase of Hermagor and was bored by its move and deliver phase.  Hence, it is no surprise that I like rather better a game that is Hermagor stripped down to its good half.

Ideally, Ornella and Binkitani would have replaced the plod around Hermagor with something meatier than Charon's simple cash in gems to build buildings.  All the same, Charon works pretty well as a lean, mean one hour super filler.

Production quality is pretty good, though the plastic flags look worryingly fragile.  The artwork and text font are best described as seventies sci-fi.  While that gives me a tingle of nostalgia, the overall effect is not very appealing.  The rules are brief and fairly clear.

Not our type of game and fell flat with us. It's easy to be a runaway leader with 2 people and it all comes down to who has more lucky draw in cards. I suppose that with more players it's more chaotic. Also the artwork was "too '80s". Traded it away.

Szegény játék hátrányból indult, mert életemben nem voltam még olyan fáradt, mint e közben, a 3. körtől kezdve kínszenvedés volt... Nem a játék hibája, hanem egy gyógyszeré, de a lényegen nem változtat, a végére majdnem elaludtam. Ennek ellenére megpróbálok tárgyilagos lenni:)
A tábla jobb oldala a Hermagorból való, így itt is érvényesek az ott leírtak: nem feltétlen érdemes a legcsábítóbbakra menni, néha jobb inkább szép csendben a szélén szerezni valamit. A másik, hogy ha valaki kevés cuccot szerez egy körben, az könnyen behozhatatlan hátrány lehet.
Az új rész az 5 akció: nos ezek közül a többség csak bizonyos szituációkban indokolt, a felső és az alsó szerintem messze a legjobb. Nagyon jó az az ötlet, hogy ha sokan maradnak egy helyen, akkor nem kapják meg az akciót. Összességében ez is legalább olyan jó (lenne), mint a Hermagor, nekem egyedüli bajom a hossza: ha ez egy max másfél órás játék lenne, kifejezetten jónak tartanám. De olyan durván AP veszélyes, hogy akár 3 órás is lehet (a mi 5 fős partink 2 és fél órás volt). És ennyire azért nem jó, hogy rendszeresen rááldozzak 3 órát az életemből. A 3 órás kategóriában sokkal jobb, színesebb játékok is vannak, a Charon egész egyszerűen túl egysíkú számolgatás ahhoz képest, hogy ilyen sokáig is tarthat. Ja és királycsinálás durván benne van.

Kellemes játék - a nagy előd árnyékában (Hermagor)
Egyszerű, gyors szabálymagyarázat után a területek megszerzéséért - a "nagy testvérből" már jól ismert fázis - gigászi kiszorító csata veszi kezdetét.
Ötletes a további 5 db lehetséges akció egyikének végrehajtásának esetleges lehetősége.
Korrekt játék, egy kis "rókabőr" érzést követően.
Kezdőkkel remekül játszható, a játék időtartama "a pont elég" (bár szerezzünk minél többet!) kategória.
Bár bénák a játékosok jelzőiként használandó "zászlók", a kártyák viszont remek minőségűek.

First play at tn game days in Nashville, was also the learner game. Very enjoyable fun time in placement mechanics and in deciding which powers to use or leave on the table. Territory fights for minerals can be fierce and waged relentlessly, fortunately they will not always be in the same place. this makes the game feel fresh each round and may well add to the longevity, this will be tested soon. I can recommend this title to those looking for something lite to get into with a group of up to Five for sure. It s not the deepest thinking strategy game due to the randomness of the placement of Minerals, but I like it that way, keeps tings interesting.

This is a clever little area control game. The place in about 30 to 45 minutes.  My wife and I enjoyed playing it for a time, but we ended up enjoying other games more. As such, I traded away. That said, I would still recommend the game as it plays quick and does involve some thought.

RATING: 5
Long/slow.  Too much confrontation and competition with very few actions (and each move forfeits an option for your end of the round action) so this one becomes a brain burner.  Players compete for resources with influence markers in a manner that is the same as the market in Hermagor.  The competition over gems is often so close/tight that you don't have any idea which gems you will win; this makes future-planning (strategy) very difficult.

Only played with two players.
Has some agonizing decisions that you need to choose between ech turn.
Not a game where going first is a good thing.
Can be an AP prone game with that type of players.
Medium heavy on the tactics level, with a lot of different paths to choose between.

Definitely a bit of a learning curve with this one -- my actions were different in the later rounds compared to the first round.  Also seemed like the same "final actions" were retained (could be groupthink there, too), so I wonder if there are a variety of paths to victory.  It does make think and plan, but I felt that I was wasting actions or flags.  The colors seemed balanced and varied in importance by round so flexibility in strategy/tactics was important.

In Charon Inc, players are staking claims to groups of gems in order to build various structures for points, which require specific gem combinations.

Essentially, in a round, players take turns putting out claim markers, attempting to have the most influence in each zone of the board to claim the gems there.  You have three options of where you can stake claims:

1) At the intersections of several zones, which give you influence in several zones, but is weak when breaking ties (which happen very frequently!).

2) On the edges of two zones, which gives you influence in only those two zones, but is slightly stronger in breaking ties.

3) In the middle of a zone, which only gives you influence in that 1 zone, but guarantees you win a tie for that zone.

At the end of the round, everyone collects their gems and builds stuff with them.  Cards specify what you can build, what gems that building requires, and how many points it's worth if you build it.  Most points worth of buildings wins!  There are some other minor things, like once per turn abilities players can get, but that's the gist of it.

In the end, you get a very abstract exercise in placing influence to collect gems which you then convert to points in certain combinations.  A working game design to be sure, but one that ultimately ends up being pretty dry and unexciting.

Reasonably good game.  Using the bidding or market mechanism from Hermagor to get materials to build what's on the cards much like Fresco.  The mechanisms sit well together.  The cards are basically things like: pay 2 green, 2 purple, 1 black, etc.  Some are in your hand, and some are public, making player order important.

RATING: 8
Suprisingly good area majority game with a really neat, refreshing mechanic.  So all players start the game with their five (in total) area-majority-gathering pieces, each on one of the five different action spaces and you get to place four (of the five) pieces.  So whatever piece you didn't place, dictates your action for that round.  What is really cool is that if more people than you are on that action space at end of the round then nobody gets to do that action.  A really interesting version of chicken emerges and it makes the game feel tense.  It plays quite quickly without a ton of rules so this was a winner for me.

A workmanlike if unimaginative rehash of the Hermagor auction.  Suffers from the random card draws and overly simplistic simple plurality rules for determining auction winners. That said, the tension of leaving special actions to other players is impressively well done.  Its a shame it is let down by the not-quite-there auction and random card incentives.

It reminds me a bit of games like Tobago. I describe these games as a "one trick pony, but the trick is pretty good". The game is remarkably straight-forward. certainly simple enough to be family fare. Except that the game is actually brutal and unforgiving. Some players expressed concerns about playing with AP prone people (or probably more accurately, people afraid of AP prone people). I really like the core mechanic. My hope is that I can use this to upsell folks to Hermagor, a game in my collectoin that I unfortunately liked, but only played once.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A not altogether unsilly attempt to split off Hermagor's market place mechanc and put it in a game of its own, that is Charon, Inc. Unfortunately time has not been kind to it, for it is actually quite a decent title, far more decent than its meager #1800-ish position on the rankings would suggest. It can move up a thousand places easily, and perhaps even one or two hundred more. That's saying something.

What I really like about Charon, Inc. is the way in which two mechanisms for control compete. One is how influence is distributed on Charon's surface. You can opt for strong and localised to weak and distributed, making for an interesting balance scale. The other is that by moving off influence flags from special actions, you have to take into account that you're not just fighting for area control, but also for some action control; and weighing these options against each other isn't always easy. It's somewhat too bad really that the game uses a barely mitigated random draw for building cards, the only way to secure points. It keeps the game somewhat light, true, but it also keeps the game somewhat light where it doesn't have to be light. Had this been solved in a more creative and decent way, Charon Inc. would have been even better.

All in all a not unpleasant surprise, and one of the very few designs from Ornella I will play without hesitation in the future. Who knows, perhaps I might even purchase a copy of my own.

Great medium weight game. Very simple and with excellent rules, yet with enough strategy to keep you interested. The actions (which are de-selected rather than selected which works well) add to the rather dry core of the game and makes it more varied.

The flag markers feel a little cheap but the rest of the components are very nice.

Elsőre 8,5-t akartam adni neki, mert a végén egy utolsó lépéssel kivédhetetlenül az elsőről a 3. helyre estem vissza, és ezt, mármint a kivédhetetlenség miatt, vontam volna. De aztán hazafelé menet átgondolva, a saját hibám volt, ha 2 lépéssel előtte nem lépek nem tökéleteset, akkor nem tudnak lelökni.
Összességében: 
Hermagor alapokon a licit-foglalás, de nem teljesen ugyanaz: a számítás, értékelés ugyanaz, csak h itt az egyes mezők tartalma (több -kevesebb van benne) miatti érték és emiatt körötte levő foglaló mezők száma is különböző. Ez ad bele egy csavart. Azért alapvetően inkább Hermagor light a játék, de nem azonos vele, vannak különbségek, más a hangulata, és rövidebb - talán ezért is mondom azt, h light.
Az első partit kicsit elhúztuk, de kezdők is a csapatban, no meg rá kellett érezni, a játékmenetre. AZ utolsó forduló /4 van/ már egész gyors volt, leszámítva 2 keresztbe tevést, :-), ami miatt 2 játékosnak át/újra kellett gondolnia a lépését. De még így is gyors volt.
Szóval tetszik: az esseniek közül talán az egyik legjobb. /Már amivel játszottam./

Update: 2. játék.
Nos igen a szerencse kiküszöbölhető, ugyanakkor nagy figyelmet igényel: ismét elkövettem egy hibát az utolsó körben -úgy láttam, h nem akadályozhatnak meg a terveimben-, de megtehették volna, szerencsére az az ellenfél, akinek érdeke lett volna az akadályozásom, az sem vette észre. :-)
Szóval jó játék továbbra is.

If you enjoy the jockeying for products on the market section of the board from Hermagor, there is a good chance you will find this enjoyable.  While I enjoy some multiplayer abstract games, they have to move along at a nice clip unlike this game that is a bit too AP prone resulting in a limited "fun" factor.

RATING: 7
Better than expected, and a lighter game that's suitable for families as well.  Combines area control mechanics with set-collection, but the real appeal is the way flags are used to stake claims with variable influence, and the `action' boxes that give special abilities from your unplaced flag.  Avoid playing with AP-prone players; this is best enjoyed with played quite casually and quickly.  Arguably at its best as a tactical game for 2-3 players.

RATING: 8
Surprisingly good, place markers for influence, collect gems, pay in gems to build buildings for VPs game. The nice part is that you leave one marker on the side panels, which triggers a benefit, and those can make a big difference, and that makes a difference during the placement as other players consider what your bonus action will be used for.

Thankfully, they resisted the modern trend to add more stuff by making the buildings have benefits too. Here it's just flat out VPs and you can't build the same one twice. The only weakness in the game therefore is that you might be dealt the same buildings and therefore be unable to build.

The game is very quick, just 4 rounds, but you do really need to think about the placement, as that has so many ramifications. Turn order matters a lot too.

So it's amazing that this got heavily discounted so soon after release. You could get a copy for €10 easily. Well worth it. Nice board, nice cards, very nice gems. Very good value.

RATING: 7
Area & resource management game.

I enjoyed the game and everyone I played with did too.  The box says 60 mins, but 45 is more like it.  Four rounds and the game is over.  Rules are clean and simple, and the board structures the play well.  The strategy is satisfying.  You can screw up the other players in several areas.  

I particularly like the mechanic where your 5 flags are each placed on one each of the five special actions, and as you remove them one at a time to claim mines for the gems, you are also losing the potential of those actions. The last flag left claims your special action, if you are lucky, or planned well, or somebody choses not to cooperate with you.

The cover of the box is interesting and inviting.  I wish more of the graphics had carried over to the board which looks dull compared to the box top.

Compared to many games it is relatively inexpensive so I should complain about the components. The gems are great but I am afraid the plastic flags will eventually break--would rather have paid a few more dollars and had sturdier flags.

Elég egyszerű szabályokból, egy elég agyalós játékot sikerült összedobni. Mindig is nagyra értékeltem az ilyeneket. Sajnos tematika az már nincs nagyon, de ezt el is nézném. A nagyobb baj az, hogy annyira káoszos, hogy képtelenség bármit előre tervezni (4 fővel). El se merem képzelni, milyen lehet öten. Esetleg hármasban még adnék neki egy esélyt. Nem rossz játék, de vannak jobbak a polcon dögivel, akik alig várják, hogy előkerüljenek. :)

u.i.: Meg kell még említeni, hogy ez a "passzív akcióválasztás" mechanika nagyon jó ötlet benne. Jó lenne ezt valami kevésbé káoszos, kevésbé kalkulálós játékban viszontlátni.

Charon Inc. is basically the auction lifted from Hermagor, transplanted to another setting and slightly reworked. It doesn't quite reach the heights of the original, mostly because of two reasons: Placement is free. Where you had to pay money to place your tokens depending on how influential the locations were you can now place your flags for free which makes some locations clearly better than others. There is no immediate payout according to your placements, either.

The second, and most likely more important reason, however, is that in Hermagor there was always stuff you didn't need, which meant that the lots were worth different amounts to different players. In Charon this has been watered down considerably, and the similarity of the building cards usually boils down simply to "more is better."

The comparisons with Hermagor are obvious and it's something good. Charon is just built around one piece of the Hermagor's mechanics.

The game is pretty simple but for a lenght of a gameplay it offers quite a bit of a challenge. The scoring mechanism is not the best I've seen in my gaming life but it works (it reminds me a bit of Wolsung: The Boardgame).

All in all a fun family game with cool components and simple rules. Worth trying.

The market piece from Hermagor developed into a full game.  The main mechanism is strong, and having the piece left behind do an action is a lovely idea, but it needs to flow quickly - too much analysis kills it.  Should be a super-filler, not the main course.

Hermagor is a game that I enjoyed when it was released, playing it numerous times.  Sadly, it has gotten lost in the avalanche of new games that continue to roll in.  Ornella has resurrected my favorite aspect of Hermagor and put it to good use here.  The game is easy to learn yet tight.  There aren't any superfluous phases or aspects.  It is filled with tough decisions, and the actions of your opponents have a direct impact on your choices.  All of this fits nicely into a tidy 1 - 1 ½ hour time frame.  This should help the game make it to the table more often than Hermagor, which is a bit more complicated and lengthy.

A potential caveat:  the game is not a mind twister.  Those enjoying deep strategy games with a myriad of possible strategies and paths to explore may be disappointed.  While it has some interesting and sometimes taxing decisions to be made, it falls on the shallower end of the depth pool.  That is not a knock.  Rather, it is a simple word of caution to those who prefer deeper fare.  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Ornella makes a game around the excellent mechanic of the market from his "Hermagor". It's used to acquire different minerals needed to build cards from the players' hands and from a common pool. Each card is worth victory points based on the number and variety of materials required. It sounds fine in theory, but the problem is that it's very hard to plan what to get or, more precisely, to know what you will end up getting. There is a lot of chaos and a clear advantage in going later in turn order, and both dramatically increase with each player added.

I always welcome a Sci-Fi theme, but it is thin, as the various minerals and buildings don't have any distinct functions. On the production, it's odd that the publisher went for plastic pieces but couldn't think of anything better than dull flags, when spaceships or astronauts would have been obviously better. The artwork is quite bland, too.

Despite the problems, the central mechanic still is quite interesting, but I'm unsure if it's enough to make the game worth many plays.

RATING: 7
I really enjoy Hermagor, but it doesn't get played much (and the rating is hurt) because it takes much longer the pay then it should. But, I really enjoy the 'bidding' in that game. Charon, takes that bidding mechanism and strips out a lot of the extras making this a relatively quick bidding game.

A re-implementation of the auction mechanism from Hermagor, but here you're left with the frustration of not getting those vital resources you need to build, as the trading mechanism is far too restrictive.

Weird game, but pretty fun. It seemed a bit too easy to kingmake unfortunately, though maybe this would be lessened at lower player counts. But the way you slowly have to come off of the actions pots, leaving fewer and fewer until you're only on one is really cool. Definitely a game where you're paying a lot of attention to what everyone else is doing as you jockey for every single thing in the game. Not really my bread and butter but it's interesting and great once in a while.

Charon Inc. succeeds in transforming the market mechanism from Hermagor into a full-blown game. There's a second clever idea in combining the central mechanism with a negative action selection, i.e. you start with pawns on all actions and possibly only can use the action where the last pawn is left and only if there's not more than one other pawn. I'm probably to positive in my intial rating but Hermagor is a good 8/10 for me and Charon Inc. was as enjoyable to play notwithstanding it's lack of the network aspect.

After several plays with varying numbers of players and with players of differing gaming expertise we have come to the conclusion that Charon Inc. is game that has a lot going for it, but which needs to be valued for what it is. Is Charon Inc. the next Agricola? No it’s not – but that’s also not what it aspires to be. Charon Inc. is best understood as a lighter, family-friendly game; one which can serve double-duty as a solid gateway game for introducing people to the world beyond Monopoly. For those of you out there who love all things sci-fi, it should be noted that the theme is somewhat pasted on, but it has to be conceded that the resource collection mechanic and the theme proved surprisingly satisfying for some of the people we tried this with. There is nothing “spacetastic” about this game in a thematic sense and one doesn't really have the feeling of being either a space explorer or a CEO of a major corporation, but there's enough there in the artwork and gameplay to offer fans of this kind of theme something to appreciate. And when played with two or three players (ideally players not prone to AP) there are undertones of elegance to Charon Inc.. Ultimately, it plays smoothly, relatively quickly, and provides a satisfying gaming experience, when matched with the right expectations.

I like Hermagor a lot, but I do not necessarily think that its market mechanism was so strong that it merits republishing as a game in and by itself. And while Hermagor was also essentially an abstract game, its colourful map and even more colourful resources are a lot more enticing to me than hunting for drab crystals on a no less drab moon.

So essentially, Charon Inc. is the epitome of a game I really was not waiting for. What saves it from a total let-down is the nifty reverse bid for special actions every round: having to start by deciding what you do not want to do is an excellent idea, and it gets some added weight by the cancellation of actions that too many players want to have.

Nevertheless, my 90 minute visit to Charon felt a lot longer than each and every of my very enjoyable 120+ minute trips to Hermagor, so I’m still a bit unclear on what this republishing is meant to achieve.

Area majority, set collection, and "worker displacement". Workers start on each of several action spaces and are moved off onto the board to control resource spaces - only one is finally left on an action. Different, and interesting.

Colourblind problems with the card symbols. Needs paste-ups and sleeves. Annoying! Why not use shapes or symbols as well as colours? 

Otherwise this is a cool game, with pretty components; I actually like the gems (shiny!) and the art evokes classic SF illustrations. Play is straightforward but presents several strategies. It is quick, with almost no downtime.

Not terribly impressed, only because I am comparing it to Hermagor. This is like a wateredown version of the other game. However, tension is just not the same. Hermagor can be quite nasty and can create competition for tiles based on board position. This game not so much, you just try to get as many gems as possible. I can't see why I would play this over Hermagor. I felt the same when comparing Goa to Industrial Waste.

Most vettem, akciósan.:) Nagyon-nagyon megérte az árat. Jó kis "belövő" játék válik majd belőle. Amilyen  - véleményem szerint - puritán és kevésbé tetszetős grafikája van(Nekem nem is tetszik egyáltalán), annál nagyobb a mélysége. Szerintem mélyebb jóval, mint gondolná az ember első ránézésre. A viszonylagos sikertelenségét a grafikájának köszönheti, mert ha nem olvasok utána, akkor én se "vettem volna le a polcról". Az biztos, hogy minél nagyobb a játékosszám annál élvezetesebb, de áttekinthetetlenebb lesz. A zászlók kiábrándítóak, a kristályok viszont jópofák és szépek.(főleg a kislányomnak tetszenek.Ráadásul a szabály egyszerű és jól értelmezhető.

Ha két szóval kéne jellemeznem:
Méltatlanul alulértékelt!:)

Hehe, this is a thinky brainburner.
Think carefully about the placements of your flags.

You place flags, to get control over an area, to get gems you need so you can build buildings which get you points.

It also include an element of what I would call opposite worker placement:) Neat mechanic.

Other than that, the game is not very inventive, the components are boring, gems scattering everywhere, boring plain gameboard, and flimsy flags which I think will break soon.

But, the game is nice to play once in a while.

Also work for 2 players.

Nem játszottam a Hermagorral, de tudom, hogy annak a játéknak egy központi részét vették ki és alkották meg a CI-t. Többségi játék, amivel egy bolygó 20 részre osztott felszínén szerzünk ásványokat, amikkel épületeket építünk. A játéknak számomra nem is ez a része tetszett, hanem az öt akció végrehajtásának feltétele. Minden játékosnak van egy-egy zászlója az öt lehetséges akción és ezekről szedi le és rakja a bolygóra, hogy onnan ásványokat szerezzen. Az 5 zászlóból 4-et rak le és a választása következtében egy akción marad zászlaja. Ezt fogja a kör végén végrehajtani, de csak akkor ha csak ő maga vagy rajta kívül még egy játékos választotta ezt az akciót. Talán kicsit lehetett volna még az akciókon dolgozni, mert nem éreztem egyenlő erősségűnek őket, de nagyon okos mechanizmus ez. A játék sajnos csontszáraz, mert ennyi az egész. Egyszerűen tűnik, mégis úgy éreztem játék közben, hogy nagyon sokat tudnék rajta agyalni. Valahogy ez a többségi mechanizmus egy El Grandéban sokkal letisztultabb. Az újrajátszhatósági faktorát sem érzem jónak. Nem rossz játék a CI, de nekem nem annyira jött be.

Generic design of area influence, cards, and cubes. It all comes down to turn order in the end, which makes the rest of it feel like a waste of time. And there's enough luck to turn order advantage that planning around it also feels like a waste of time, not a good quality in such a dry, methodical game.

RATING: 6
It's Hermagor, stripped of all the interesting stuff except for the market/auction. Which, really, is a pretty intersting part of Hermagor. This is not a bad game, I suppose, but I just didn't have a lot of fun playing it. You have to pick which battles to fight and be careful not to over commit to a region you end up losing -- sort of like Taj Mahal, that way: losers lose everything. Maybe it's simply because I don't do auctions very well? 

--- Summary ---
The board shows Charon divided into several regions. Each round, seed the regions with a mix of gems. Players start with a hand of building cards: at the start of each round, everyone puts one into a common pool. At the end of each round, you get additional cards.

Players' bidding flags start out 1 in each of the special power areas. Go around bidding till each player has just one flag unspent. Bid by moving a flag from its space to a location on the board -- in a region, on a border btwn 2 regions, or on an intersection (corner) touching 2-4 regions. After all bids placed, use the special power where your last flag stands -- that is a pretty cool twist, where you have to decide which special power you want to try for (but you only get it if you're alone on that power; or if there's 2 of you in a 5er game!). Then resolve each region: the player with the most flags in/around it wins all the gems. Ties broken by seniority, where a flag is more "senior" if it affects fewer regions (center then edge then corner).

After all gems collected, players (in turn order) use their gems to build cards from common pool and/or their hand (but may never build cards with same number). May trade gems (3:1?) to get the colors you need, and may only save a limited number of gems from turn to turn. Some special powers change trade ratio and holding limit.

After 5 rounds, player who built the highest sum of buildings wins.

The 'market bidding' aspect of [gameid=25224] transported to space to mine for gems needed to construct buildings for VP.

The designer duplicated his brilliant subgame of area influence from the brain-burning Hermagor, and Charon is the accessible result.  The quick-moving rounds give this an alacrity missing is larger games of this type.  The game of chicken for the special powers is a delicious bonus. Play it light and Charon is easy to get to the table.  Ugly flags, tho.

A dash for claims to control mining regions on the surface of a rock moon, this is the bit from Hermagor's market. Add a dash of special powers revealed by elimination and collection of multi-coloured sets of gems to most efficiently built points building and you have this game.

I enjoy this game from time to time. It's not earth shattering and doesn't offer a lot in the way of replayability but it's solid and now and again a fun game to play.

The abstract nature of it seems to make one think it should be good as a 2 player and I'm sure people do love it at 2 but for me it's a fail. I like the tension of having to wait for your turn to see if that next spot you wanted is still going to be available after 3 or 4 other players have taken their action. That's totally missing in 2 player games.

BEST WITH 3!

To be fair, there are a couple of things I like about the game.  I think it's clever that you pick an action by moving your pieces off of particular spaces, and take an action with what you have left on the board.  I also like the tie-breaker rule that's based off of your position on the nodes, so that the more you're trying to get with one piece, the less likely you are to get it.  Those two elements are the key parts of the game, but for some reason, they don't come together to make a great game.  It's a fine, inoffensive little game, but there's nothing there to make it more than just an average game for me.  It's ultimately very forgettable.

Totally boring for 2pl. Some mechanics work at 20% - too easy to gain points. On this level the winner is the player with better cards drawn. Pure luck. It's almost impossible to play it wrong.
I'm sure this will be good for 4 pl, but I don't wanna prove it just to be just. Couples - beware and look for something better and funnier. Shame on publisher - it's not 2 player game to be paid for.

I like the design of [b][i]Charon Inc.[/i][/b] more than I like actually playing the game. Players have markers on each of the five action spaces, and during a round they take turns removing one marker of their choice from a space and placing it on the game board to try to claim gems of various colors, gems that will be used to buy building cards that are worth points. If you're the only player with a marker on an action after everyone has placed four of their five markers, then you get the action; if you share the space with someone else, no one gets the action. Great idea!

In practice, though, I was bored during the game. My one five-player game took [i]forever[/i], even though it didn't seem like we were playing appreciably slow. You just had to weigh every choice, then reconsider as to what could happen after you, and which markers others might move, and so on. Before you knew it, the rooster was crowing and the cows kicking to be milked.

In a second game with three players, play went more quickly but was still blah, possibly due to the lack of excitement in the building round. Lots of tension while placing markers, followed by a low-key shifting of gems for cards that made you look to the heavens and wonder why you were doing this.

[i]Charon Inc.[/i] is a great game for some people, but I'm not one of them.

I bet the corporate giants that run Charon, Inc., spend a lot of time debating whether Charon is a moon of Pluto, or whether the two astronomical bodies actually comprise a binary system.  What I wouldn't give to be a fly on that atmosphere-free boardroom wall.

As far as the game goes, I do worry that the geometric bidding system may be screwy.  If a player always places his/her flags in corner spaces, for example, it's possible to leap ahead in gems by (1) winning gems on the periphery of the board for very little investment, and/or (2) placing multiple flags in the interior of the board in such a way that they count towards multiple lots.

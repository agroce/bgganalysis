RATING: 4
The ever changing river makes this slightly chaotic for my tastes. One play left me wondering whether the game is just about maximising your score each turn or whether there is potential for longer term planning. If the latter, the rating is likely to rise otherwise it will merely be a "pleasant" game

Took me forever to get to this one, and I'm glad, in 2017, that I finally did. This is the departed FBD's first "real" game, after the 2P Kosmos Hellas game. Played with 2P, which seems to be the way to go unless you want strictly tactical chaos. With 2P you have an element of strategy, and the screwage makes more sense in being zero-sum. Ultimately played like a sufficiently-themed abstract to me. Liked it a lot.

Not a strong 2 player game, but respectable at 4.  The game is not a stand-out design, but can be enjoyed fairly easily.  Game play rewards those who plan ahead and execute to a good plan.  [GTI Code: TPSD]

Light euro game that loses a point and a spot in my collection for coming in an unnecessarily large box. When it came out I remember being excited about the possibility of playing it. The game play is interesting as you try to figure out whether its better to change the river flow, construct, position your farmers, or push out your opponents. I've noticed the game can stagnate towards the end if multiple people are close to winning and the scoring cards are pushed to the back so as not to give the next player a win.

I really like this game.  It "kind of" has a feel of Settlers without trading (and I don't like the trading in Settlers), and with actual confrontation (you can run workers out off from high ground or with more workers).  And, redirecting the rivers is very fun and pretty effective to the game strategy.  Plays quick, too.

Good fun with plenty of opportunity for screwage. Maybe shows its age slightly in the fact that it can slow down almost to a halt in the end game if you all beat each other up but that is a minor criticism.

Another play, all of the above still stands but the liability to AP is definitely a problem with the wrong group. Took over 2 hours this time.

I totally agree with the people who've said this game has shades of Tikal, which is probably why I don't like it very much.  I don't like Tikal either!  I gave this game and Tikal each a "7" rating, though, because I do recognize them as good games... they just aren't my kind of games.

A fun, tactical game.  It moved along pretty quickly and it is a game that to me is quite fluid as the board can change quickly.  You have the ability to see what is coming up in the next couple of turns so you can somewhat plan for it, but really you have to make the best move that you can each turn while leaving you set up for something, hopefully, on the next person's turn.

The endgame can somewhat be anticlimatic as on my turn there was nothing I could do to stop the next person from building his last casa.

The more players there are, the more conflict there is.  I find it a really good two-player game, which is a big plus.  More players typically means more swearing.  It can be frustrating when it's your turn and you basically have to start over, but them's the breaks.

Nice action point allowance game.  Based on the meeple movement system and economic system, player choices are fairly limited.  Prone to analysis paralysis.  I traded my copy.  QUALITY COMPLAINTS:  You have to force the board together (i.e. force the hexes into the edge pieces)... and I wish the river segments were not made of cardboard since they get handled a lot.

This game has a great idea and it can be a lot fun, even though it`s chaotic and confusing. Problem is: since it is not a game to be played so often - not enough depth or geniality in design - the rules are just too tricky to be read again everytime you want to play it. Makes you lazy and simply prefer something else.

A wonderful, almost purely tactical abstract game, with very simple rules and clean gameplay. Small moves can be devastating for your opponent, and the game can get pretty cutthroat as you move the river around. The game is balanced, however, so you often have a good chance to recoup losses, and games tend to be pretty close. Best with two players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Unique gameplay where you try to maximize your position while hampering your opponents as best as you can.  Aggressive play is required, which is somewhat unusual in a German game.  Seems like a person falling behind in the early game has no chance of recovering, which can be a drag.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Unusual tactical economics game with a minor war game element. It's not an every weekend kind of game for me, but it's good occasionally. Down time can become a problem if people spend too much time analyzing their possibilities, because there's not much to do on other players' turns besides occasionally collect money. Probably better with two than with four.

The miscut board parts that don't fit together correctly -- as well as the "it's not our fault so we're going to do nothing about it" attitude of Mayfair's customer service -- was annoying to the point of sapping a lot of the fun out of this one. Back on the shelf it goes. Indefinitely. We now think twice about purchasing any game with the Mayfair logo.

Kind of a mean Euro game where players are fighting to get to the source of two rivers, and I think I remember there was a way to affect each other's board positions. It was really rough on newbies to learn and it was the sort of thing I had to be in the mood for, so I eventually got rid of it.

PS: And then I got it again as ballast in a trade. Guess I'll eventually give it another go.

Finally, a decent "German" game with some original mechanics!  No auctions, or any of that tired crap.  Also, very much confrontational!  If you wanna win, you gotta get out there and kick some ass!  No skulking about and sleazing a win out the back door from this one ... There is downtime when playing with 4 players, because there's no way to plan ahead for your move, things change so quickly and drastically.

RATING: 8
The idea of this game is very creative.  Prosperity must be gained from the river, which can be dammed and redirected.  The puzzle-piece borders keep the variable board pieces tight, so that the pieces stay on nicely.  The river pieces look great on the board.  Both the shape of the rivers and the layout of the board provide alot of variety between games.  We play this 2-player, which takes about an hour.  There is quite a bit to consider on each turn.

This is a excellent game of positioning and tactics. The game did have slightly more control with 3 rather than 4 but either way it requires thinking ahead while maximizing your current turn.

My first play with 4 will also be my last play with 4: the game is far too chaotic at that player number to be fun. You cannot hold on to anything worthwhile, and with the river changing location on nearly every turn it is impossible to predict where it'll end up, defeating any prepositioning strategy. This is a game for the lower end of the player scale. I expect that with 2 it is actually too calculable (it is, I think, a perfect information game, although not without randomness even though the lookahead is fairly deep) to be fun, meaning that my current estimate of the optimum number of players is 3. I'll update the rate when I have more information at more amenable player numbers.

Components: Beautiful board and components; the narrowness of the river pieces, of which I was dubious at first, turned out to be a plus, as it made them easier to place and remove when there were Campesinos and Casas dotting the landscape.

Experience: Reminds me a bit of Mexica, where on my turn I try to maximize my possible movement, to improve my position, and then trigger a scoring. The mechanics are very sleek, including that by which the river is redirected. In future plays I expect that the down time in between turns will bother me more; so much can happen between turns, with the rivers being redirected every which way, that it is almost painful to watch what I am powerless to prevent. In this particular outing I wasn't too bothered by it, as I was still learning the game; but in a playing where I am more invested in winning, I might want to avert my eyes when it's not my turn.

A hard one to rate.  On the whole, a good gamer game.  With two players the game is very good, but with three or four there is lots of chaos and analysis paralysis can set in creating lots of downtime.  The luck of the desperadoes is also a bit of a pain.  I'll be playing this one in the future but probably only as a two player game.

Simple rules and reasonable playing time.
The way you can modify the rivers course to irrigate your farmland is interesting.
Fairly aggressive tactical game, you take a lots of hits but you can quickly come back in the fight, which makes for a dynamic game.
Enjoyable from time to time with the right kind of people.

4 Players games may drag a little too long as there are the same resources whatever the number of players in the game. A good 3 players game.

The river movement is makes this game fairly unique.  I think you need to have a group that will play this game fairly aggressively (building dams and running campesinos off) to make this a fun game.  Since my group tends to be more passive, we thought is was okay.

RATING: 7
I really like the dam mechanic which can completely change the lay out of the board. This, and chasing off your opponents "meeplinos", make it a very tactical game where changes between turns will be so dramatic that planning beyond the current turn is nearly pointless. Only six action points per turn helps limit the downtime, but the addition of dams and chasing could make this game drag with analysing/counting players. For a light, tactical game its a lot of fun. Only played it with three players. I suspect it would be too chaotic for my tastes with four and possibly a more thoughtful game with only two players.

Players are farmers trying to scratch a living by harvesting crops on tiles where a couple of rivers trickle through.  Players spend six action points to position their pieces, possibly ousting opponents back to town (ie. off the board), and to also place dams to divert the flow of the river through different hexes.  Harvesting earns money, money buys builings, buildings win the game.  Some clever stuff, with a high "take that!" factor.

Not overly impressed with this one. It can be a little too chaotic with the way the board can completely change and there seems to be a little too much luck with the way the cards come out.

(2-4 players) Like Settlers of Catan in collecting resources to build to win, but every turn the board can change due to the fickle nature of the flowing river and opponents bending it to their advantage. Played this a couple of times and still don't know what to make of it. Gameplay goes fairly well until it ends rather abruptly, unlike other games where you can get in a few punches at the end to try to win.

Simple game and fun, but too easy to be negative to the other players. Diverting the river is a good mechanism though. *** Played it again, it's still simple in my eyes and you spend much of your time driving other people off the board and re-diverting the rivers back to where you want. Maybe it works best with 4 players; 3 players made it too easy to attack one person.

Played 3 times. Initially didn't have a real desire to play it, something about the graphic presentation turned me off it a little. Played it 2 players today, and I am still not certain what I think of it. Kind of a lot of heavy tactical consideration, but quite a bit of luck too. Neat mechanisms and nice theme mean I have to try this a few more times...

Yikes.  What a brutal game of water management through damn building and cunning redirections.  Forget the Three Gorges; Dos Rios' damns will make anyone scream: 'Damn!'.  Tough competition and an analysis-paralysis candidate as much can be done with only 6 moves every turn.  Game ends suddenly when someone comes up with the right conditions.  Can't wait to see this with 4 competitive players.

Game uses an AP system but even though you can see what/where you might need to be for several subsequent rounds you can't really plan ahead : placement of your pieces can change on other players turns when your 'campasinos' are chased off.  Great game, Recommended especially if playing with 3.

Dos Rios did not have the most successful first game, however it seems to have elements that I really enjoy.  Although it feels Dos Rios didn't fully spread its wings there is enough here that I am compelled to play again.  Understanding the possibilities with each turn, and maximizing ones potential for present and future turns seemed slightly opaque for me at first.  It wasn't until towards the final couple rounds that things began to click -  but my previous positioning had left me in a poor situation.  There is an interesting balance between ones immediate objective and also trying to secure ones ability to harvest on other players' turns.  The screwage factor is nice and high, but it is a constant that continually evens itself out - and shouldn't ever leave anyone to far out of the running.  Plus the idea of your little campesinos charging down the hill waving guns is a wonderful image.  The river mechanic is truly unique and adds both a thematic and fresh game play experience.  The quick play time in balance to the decisions is at a nice meeting point for me.  I am excited to try this again.

RATING: 8
This is a very unquie and fun game. I love the mechanic of how the river flows and the damns that are used to change the flow of the river during the game. This is a great 2 player game. I'm not sure how it would play with 3-4, as it may begin to get a bit chaotic. Especially with 4 players. The game components look great and are well made however I have never been a fan of paper money. Beings there are only 2 denominations used in the game. It not to bad.

The game is a lot of fun and there is plenty of room for strategies and tactics to be used through out the game. There can be a lot of the screw your neighbor going on in the game, which is not a bad thing in this game. It's actually a lot of fun. I can see some people having problems with ap on this one on occasion. Nothing overly so.

I really enjoy this game, as it just has a feel of it's own. I can't think of any other games that I have that are like it, which is a huge plus. I really feel this is under-rated for some reason here on the geek. The game really deserves much better ratings. There are so many choices to be made and things to do and how to go about doing them, yet are limited in your options.

I'd highly recommend this clever and unique game to gamers. It's not a heavy game, but I also dont feel it is a family game either. Though it may be for some. If you get the chance to play this. Don't pass it up, as the game is getting older now and could go oop. I am very glad that I took a chance on this game and bought it. There's a lot of fun to be had with this one.

A very good game with so much negative interaction that it's completely not my style.

The random board is created in a way I've never seen before - unique and yet it serves its purpose of making the game highly replayable.

Screw you! Screw you! Screw you!  And that's about it.  Whoever gets screwed a little less often wins (unlike real life).  Not much ability to make plans, and not much feeling that my moves matter.

Initial rating of 7.5

Extremely brutal game. Do not play this with people that cant take "being picked on". I like the clever river mechanic. The end game can be a tad anticlimactic if the players don't police each other. 

Q: Brutal? Really? How so?

A: Every time you take a turn you cant help but screw at least one other person out of something. You can even focus your "love" to a specific person. Both a good and bad thing depending on who is playing.

Q: Policing the other players, how do you mean?

A: There are several games out there that require the players to keep each other in balance. Should the players not be willing to take action against another  player he can run away with the win.

Q: OK, can you give me another example of a game that requires the players to "police" each other?

A: Sure, Domaine and Cave Troll are the first two that leap to mind. With all of these games the players are set with the task of winning and part of that is to make sure the other players don't walk away with the win because they wouldn't help prevent them from doing so.

This "feature" is neither good nor bad, it simply needs to be recognized by the players. Otherwise it can become very frustrating to see someone hand the win away through a lack of prevention.

One of the hidden gems in my opinion. Awesome mechanic with damming the river. This damming of the rivers is the main driving force of the game. Just when you think you have the win in your pocket, someone changes the flow of the river and you're left out to dry. 

And the money aspect of the game just throws another curve ball in. You need to make the river flow such a way, that you can earn money. 'Cause without the money you can't build buildings. And without the buildings you can't win. 

This game should hit the table a lot more often.

The old tired and boring plantation theme, but with an unusual very high degree of confrontation, at least if played competitively. The mechanic of diverting the rivers is very original and I bought the game for it alone. There is some randomness, especially with the appearance of the "desperados", which may be decisive, but there is still room for tactics and clever playing. Just don't play it with four players, as it may take too long and there is less control.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Great and original game with 2 players. Never played it as a 3 or 4 player game, but the more players playing it, the more chaos you will get and that will overshadow a really good game.

Think of it as a 2 or maybe 3 player game and you will be fine and get a good tactical game with a unique mechanism.

RATING: 6
An interesting idea but I found there to be far too much downtime for my liking. There is no point in worrying much about what happens in everyone elses turn, things are so different each time it gets round to your move that each turn is a minimaxing excercise.

Once someone has a lead it is hard to catch them and it can be very painful waiting for the game to end.

First game with 4 players was far from enjoyable. Any plans I had for future turns came to naught as the situation often changed radically from turn to turn.

A unique 30 minute meaty filler of area control for 2 people (light midweight) that is perfect for weeknights. With 3 players it is a nice 45 minute midweight and quite a good game, 4 will be a little too chaotic and probably not a good number for this. 2 and 3 are about equally good.

Screwage! Lots of opportunity for it here by building dams, kicking their guys off the board and more. A fun game with nice components and a pretty good theme. Being able to change the river adds a nice dynamic and the desperados while random a little tension and add a fun element.

My wife reigns supreme in this game. Is it her civil engineering background?  No, it's her lack of desire to ever look ahead in games.  Dos Rios is nearly 100% tactical.  I try to plan ahead and get crushed.  She maximizes her current turn only, and smashes me.

I'm pretty horrible at this game, but it still interests me. My preference is with four players.

In my first (and so far, only) play of this, the winner was apparent about three times around the board before we actually ended the game, which was about one time around the board earlier than it would have ended if we had let it go to the bitter end.  I was leading at the mid-game so everyone attacked me, and there was nothing I could do to recover at the end-game.  The result might have been an aberration, but it didn't feel like one.  I might give it another chance at some point, but I'm not jumping at the chance to play it again.

The mechanic of the two rivers flowing down the valley with the ability to change their course via dams is a pleasing one.  However, the game can suffer with down-time between player's moves.

Played a few games now and the game seems to get more 'strategic' each time.

Limited options provide for subtle analysis on every one of your moves:  Do you maximise points for yourself or try to screw your neighbour?  Do you bury a lucrative card or take it (even if it means giving points to your opponent)?

Lots of choices make this a true gamer's game.

Played this at a demonstration of the game at BAYCON in Hamilton, Ontario. Great components, relatively easy rules, but requires paying a lot of attention. Strategies are easily confounded, but if you don't plan ahead, you'll most certainly lose. The two river mechanic is very different and is reminiscent of a sort of Rube-Goldberg machine - even carefully placed dams can result in unexpected river courses if another player sees a flaw in your planning and dams upstream.
Not quite my style, but definitely worth looking at.

While a 4 player game seems to really bog down in the endgame and almost literally either come down to luck of the draw in harvest tile OR due to someone in a kingmaking role, the aggressiveness required in the game is enjoyable.

An unusually combative Eurogame!  The river flowing mechanism is fun and playing dams to divert the flow adds greatly to this game.  Managing the placement of campesinos makes for tough tactical choices on one's turn.  There is some truth to the criticism that you can basically leave the room after your turn in a four player game as the board will be so different by the time your turn comes again that it's not worth thinking about your position in advance.

I was pleasantly surprised after almost being let down, however I was not at all taken with this game.
The most unique aspect here is that it’s a racing game with an action point allowance system that also has a river whose course you can alter for fun and profit. The river itself is quit ingenious; however the scoring cards are random, but can come out in streaks to your negative benefit; especially later in the game when movement is much more limited.

It’s a fine game that’s for sure, and possibly one that will see play again, it’s just that I see more value in the mechanics and interactions than that of the overall play.

Very nice components wise and a neat mechanic for the river flow make this game of interest. First few games seem chaotic (and more chaotic with more players too), but already the game has started to feel more strategic. Downside is the wait between turns while your opponent(s) weigh up each move; there is a lot to consider and many options, so down time can be significant, especially with the highly analytical.  Plus it is hard to plan a turn very much in advance because of how much things can change between turns.

Cada jugador en su turno construye Casas o mueve campesinos a lo largo de uno de los dos ríos. Al finalizar, activa una de las 3 posibles cartas aleatorias desplegadas, que irriga algún tipo de terreno (o la totalidad de uno de los ríos), donde están sus campesinos o casas, con lo que gana plata para seguir comprando casas o campesinos (también hay una hacienda).
A la vez, en vez de comprar puede construir diques, que desvían uno de los ríos con la idea de regas sus terrenos, ya que solo así dan plata al sacar la carta ya  mencionada). Esta es la parte de interacción entre los jugadores, cuando se secan los terrenos de los contrincantes.

Solid, though not remarkable light-medium game.  Not super deep but it makes up for it in really novel mechanics with the shifting of the river and that strategy.

Chaotic romp but still fun. Since it's difficult to plan ahead, plays best with a lower number of players. Each turn is an exercise in maximizing position for your payout. There exists some strategic moves but in general, Dos Rios is a game of tactics. 

There is a level of direct confrontation when choosing to kick an opponents meeples back to the city so the take that level can be pretty intense at times.

We've run into king maker endings a few times so that's somewhat troubling but it still sees the table so we're still having fun with it.

I was sucked in by the hype. It certainly is and interesting and original mechanic; of gaining control of the river, and screwing your oponent in the process. However its far more tactical than strategic; you can't start to think about what you are going to do until your turn, because things will change before then. With my usual 2 person opponent (and I don't think I'd like this one with more) this leads to tidious amounts of AP.

I was a bit skeptical at first.  First of all, Dos Rios is not recognized very well in the community and second, I was unsure about a 2 player game of it.

Suffice to say I was surprise in a good way when it comes to the flow of the game.  It is a fairly quick, very evil game of kicking one out of the rich crop fields.

What I like best about the game is the multiple dynamic element.  The rivers are not static, the board is made of parts so 2 games aren't likely to be like another you already played.

With that said, Dos Rios got my thumbs up.  Great game.

New in collection jan. 08 Bought from Lajos.

Nice concept & different gameplay. 
Although it's definitely a euro it feels different to the most euro's. Very underrated here, if you're into the 'screw your neighbour and everyone else' game this one should be on your radar if it's not already in your collection...
Works fine with 2 too. Don't play it with 4 unless you're in for some chaos. The only time I played it with 4 the game ran too long and we used up all the dams 2 whole turns before the game ended....

NL: 
Erg leuk spel waarbij je probeert in een landschap te oogsten van vruchtbare landschappen. Landschappen zijn alleen vruchtbaar als 1 van de 2 rivieren erg langs loopt. Maar gelukkig kun je de loop van de rivieren beinvloeden met dammen. En eventueel je tegenstanders wegjagen...

Goed spel, leuk vormgegeven in een steeds wisselend bord.

Of course, this is based on only one play with 2 players.  My opponent liked it better, but we both thought it a little too easy to manipulate things to one's advantage.  I like the river mechanism quite a lot.  I did not use the houses very well, and got blocked out a lot.  Not a bad game, but did not knock me over.

While I didn't dislike Dos Rios, it was a disappointment after Fjords and Manila. The main problem being that the goal of the game is "get 25 points". Sure, those "points" are each 100 pesos or florins or something and you buy stuff with them along the way, but there's just no room for varying strategies; I'm trying to get 25 points and so are you. And there's only one way to get points. So we take turns moving the river back and forth. Until one of us gets 25 points.

Stop crying and learn to play the game.  If your men keep getting booted off the board, expend a movement point and either group them in two's or put them on higher ground.

RATING: 6.5
A tactical game where players are trying to build houses and a hacienda by two rivers. Players have 6 action points which they distribute to their 6 workers. Income is earned by having a presence in the terrain, irrigated by the river,  that is scoring. Other opponent's units can be forced to return to base if you attack from higher ground or outnumber them. Players can change the course of the river by setting up dams. In the only 4 player game I played, it was quite chaotic with the board changing significantly after your turn. I heard that it was less chaotic with 3 players. It's all right, I would play this again and so that I can form a better opinion.

Not a bad little tactical game.  It seems like the Campesinos (worker pieces) are a little too easy to force out of squares, as often they only last one turn in a square before someone else kicks them out. I wonder if 4 action points would have been a little bit better instead of 6.

A typically simple yet clever design by the late Mr. Delonge, with many choices to make in ways that continue to unfold over the course of the game. Fairly abstract and--no pun intended--dry, although the screwage element of the game does tie into the theme somewhat, especially in diverting precious water for one's own ends.

The rules are pretty well written, and although there appear at first to be many rules to keep in mind, play unfolds intuitively. Really interesting mixture of tactics, including placement of dams, running off others' campesinos (I like the conflict aspect), and trying to score as land is grabbed up and available scoring fields along rivers shrink. 

As with the late Mr. Delonge's other games I own and play ("Fjords," "Hellas," and "Transamerica"), there is much more to this game than first appears. The board, artwork and pieces are very attractive as well. 

I couldn't picture ever finding a group of people to play this with, so I sold it to a guy locally.

I played 95% of one game of this. After 1.5 hours with lots of downtime, the four of us came to the realization that nobody would be able to win on his own turn, he could only set up the next player. So we decided to quit rather than play for *another* tortuous hour, at which point someone would be forced to make a river block to make the next player win. While I suppose this game isn't technically broken, it seems to me that with fairly competent players you'll always end in a situation like this, so it will *greatly* outlast its welcome.

Players move their workers around the board (which is composed of variable groups of hexes) building houses along the banks of two rivers. Each turn certain hexes along the river pay out, either in money (which you use to build houses) or lumber (used to make dams). The first player to construct all five of their buildings (four houses and one hacienda) or a hacienda and three houses that are all on a riverbank, wins. Players build dams to change the flow of the rivers.

Crazy at times how much the river can change!  Makes it hard to strategize and plan very well when people are messing with those rivers so much.  It's lighter on strategy & control, but makes for a fun family game overall.  Recommended.

Interesting game, and I can see where some people would really enjoy it. But some games feel more like work to me, and this is one of them.  It was hard to score anything big, your opponent(s) or the thieves from the mountains are constantly knocking your men back to start.  Each of us scored like 1-3 points each turn. The river gets moved and you have to start all over with a new plan. The game sounds really fun on paper, but to me, it just wasn't that fun at all.

There are some nice ideas. I liked the flowing of the river mechanic. But the game is quite impredictable, you play your turn, at your next turn the board is completellly changed.

RATING: 6
This is a very tactical game. The river course often changes significantly between turns so one must maintain enough flexibility in plans to be reactive. But there is nothing one can do between turns other than watch to see how the river flows change.  As a result, I felt that the game was perhaps a bit too long for the gameplay involved, but a check of the clock when finished indicated that our game had lasted 90 minutes including rules explanation. So the game does play more quickly than it feels to be playing.

But with 6 movement points per turn and builds limited only by money and resources (wood for dams), there can be quite a few options for each turn and a lot of analysis as a result.  One modest concern - with 2 rivers to develop, this game might be best with 2 or 4 so that the efforts can be split.  With 3, the game might be a bit asymmetric as 2 players are in direct competition giving an advantage to the third.

This is one of those games that was *very* fun on the first play or two, but became a grinding affair soon thereafter. The game simply takes too long to come to a conclusion for the effort you put into it. There is certainly a nice peak of interest in the middle of the game, but at least 1/3 of the playtime is anti-climactic. 

In theory, it's still a reasonable game; the mechanics are unique, and the dam building could have been really cool. Unfortunately, it's just not. I'm tempted to take a stab at streamlining the play to really make the game enjoyable. . . . We'll see if I ever do that.

There is a lot to like about this game; components, artwork, mechanics. etc. The "chaos" doesn't bother me (except I don't know how much interest I have in playing with four) but it just seems to go too long. Next time I'm going to try it with a timer and see if it improves.

Its really amazing how one extremely clever mechanic involving the redirection of a river can change a game from being a bland building game with a runaway leader problem and too much player conflict into an extremely fun game with a runaway leader problem and too much player conflict, but this one shows how to do just that.

Race game in which players locate workers and dams, to get the money and wood, that they need to build their houses and haciendas, and to manipulate the rivers to improve their performances. The first to place all his buildings wins. The game may promote kingmaker situations at the end, when nobody wants to give an advantage to the player on the lead, usually benefiting the one in second place.

2-4 player screw-your-neighbor game. This game seemed on the verge of greatness, but didn't quite get there. I don't really know why. The game always ending just when you're starting to have fun?

A game with some interesting mechanics(that frankly doesn't seem to gel well). 6 APs per person/turn may not seem like alot but toss in dams and other players positions on the board and this one stalls a little (analysis paralysis).

An innovative, dynamic river mechanism is the most distinctive feature of this game. It played well enough with two people when my wife and I tried it, but it got annoying having my lands dry up and my guys chased off all the time. I think it would be bad with 3-4 players.

Very nice components wise and a neat mechanic for the river flow make this game of interest.  First few games seem chaotic, but already the game has started to feel more strategic.  Downside is the wait between turns while your opponent(s) weigh up each move.  A winner so far, may improve further with more plays.

Eiye yie yie!  A fantastic game of taming the mills in Mexico.  Build Casas, Haciendas and Move the river to farm seems docile enough.  Alas, no finally a euro that relies on direct confrontation (I know there are others, but they are too few).  The screwage factor is high, but even still it is fun to have your guys charge down from the hills and take over farmland.  So far, my favorite game of the year, could rate higher with more plays. I will only play this with two or three players and with a timer, still hits the table often.

Now that I've played three times and am kind of getting into the flow of it (heh), I'm appreciating this one more and more.  Very tactical, yes, but there are definite strategic implications pivoting on decisions like where you build your buildings.  Moves slower than you think it should, but I'm okay with that, too.  P.S.  Man!  It's hard to find a group who'll play this.  But, getting back onto the table at long last, I have to say I still like it!

RATING: 7
Not a bad game, though a bit on the long side.  The board changes enough that planning for one's next turn doesn't always pay off.  This is one of those games that I'll need to play a few more times before I'll really have a solid opinion.  At the moment, it seems overly long for what it is, but that may be due to inexperience--three of the four players in my first game had never played before.  Certainly the theme is interesting, as is the mechanic of shifting the rivers' paths.

Have only played with 2.  Lots of screwage, very hard to play defensively, attack and leave yourself open to attack or just grab for points and leave yourself open to attack.  Would like to play with more than 2 to see, but would expect that you would have even less men on the board at the beginning of each of your turns.  Very tactical, but luckily you can do a lot with 6 action points.  Not really my kind of game. 2008/10/28

It seems that spots on the hillside are pretty fluid; you're always being chased off back to town, so turns are pretty tactical (you're looking at short term gains more than anything else), but it plays so quickly (each turn) that this doesn't matter and you don't have time to get upset by it.

All in all, a pretty fun little game.

Whenever I try to think of a game that is a "hidden gem" I think of this one.

Dos Rios is a game where you manipulate two rivers by placing dams and making the river flow to certain resources. I do not usually like area control, but it work very nicely with this one.

Fun game, lots of choices, great design.

Just played my first game (2 player).  I really love the way the rivers shift and flow.  There is a bit of downtime, but I don't think it's as bad as Tikal (which I love), because the choices are a little simpler.  My initial rating is a bit conservative since it was only one playing.  If it plays well with more, it will probably go up.

Now I have played it as a four player game.  The game lasted over 2.5 hours (we tend to be a slow group), but it did not seem that long at all to me.  *I* really enjoyed it, and my partner for the first game enjoyed it, but the jury is still out for the rest of the group.  Even though I enjoyed it, the length restricts its playability, so I am keeping my initial rating.

I didn't enjoy my first and only play of this. Reflecting on the mechanics however, it struck me that there's more than meets the eye here. Yet, there are a couple fundamental aspects about the game I didn't like. One is the conveyor belt scoring mechanic, which I felt wasn't done "right". It needed to be more clever, or with more player control, or something. My other issue was that decisions were very much about the here and now, since longer term investments are so easily undone that it is hard to justify making them unless there's really nothing else that will help your immediate goals. Longer term positions seemed to develop as the result of tactical investments that just happened to stay there rather than get wiped out. In any event the subtleties of trying to deal with other players' intrusions and balancing this need with immediate gain just bored me.

Container is a cutthroat game, as is Manila, so it should come as no surprise that Dos Rios, by the same designer, is cutthroat, as well.  It's a different style of game from the others -- it's more about positioning and cutting other players off from certain regions of the board than it is about bidding and taking opportunities away from opponents -- but the whole point of the game is to be confrontational and strand other players on their turns.  It suffers slightly from being a "Don't leave the state of the board in such a way as to benefit the next player" game, but since that's the whole point of the game, it's hard to complain too much about it.  I can see this easily becoming a 7 or 8 game, and being extraordinary with 2 players.

Franz-Benno Delonge made some interesting games before he passed away... not the best and not the worst, but unique to be sure... one-dimensional resource production, "take-that" mechanics and a chaotic river flowing system make for a pretty neat game to play once in a while...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Love the production quality, and love the planning and visualization to reroute the river, but there is little you can do before your turn to prepare yourself, as the board changes dramatically from turn to turn -- which means a lot of AP and downtime. Even with that, the game would be about an 8.5 for me if it weren't for the absolutely atrocious endgame -- reaching the point of foregone conclusion where the only turn option you have is to do nothing and let Player A win, or do something and let Player B win. That is not a fun position to be in.

So far I've only played Dos Rios with 2 players and while manipulating the rivers is fun it also feels like we're just going back and forth. I'll put my guys on the board, they'll replace my guys with their guys, I'll replace their guys with my guys until it all abruptly ends when one of us builds their last house.

Just one playing so far. Feels like a good game. Not great, but it has some uniqueness in the river flow. You never know, where the river will flow, but you can try to predict it to some level. And as more dams are built, the possibilities go down..

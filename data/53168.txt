A pleasant enough trick taking game but there as just as good games you can play with a standard pack of cards

RATING: 8
There is a lot more strategy than originally meets the eye in this game.

Think of it as Hearts/Spades for two players in Roman times :)

What is so amazing about this game is the depth of strategy. After you play it once, you will not understand how to win so well. After you play it a handful of times, you will start to understand all the different things you can do to try to ensure you will win.

Great two-player filler game!

A very solid, fast 2-player trick-taking card game which fills an important niche in my collection. It is well balanced and crafty - you can 'run' a hand if you play well, but to go too quickly to one color can later be ruinous. Any player who enjoys trick-based card games is sure to find this one a real winner. And the new version is far nicer than the old.

I feel very fortunate to have secured a copy of this game during the initial printing (I have #52!).  I am sure that there will be a number of future printings - it is very close to the perfect trick taking game, in my opinion.  It's quick, but has strategic depth (due to the multiple hands needed to complete the game).  Sometimes you try to lose a few hands because you don't have the cards needed to put your choice in power - but if you've got to throw some hands, you still try to avoid letting your opponent's likely candidate come ahead.  This could be a breakout game for the developer (and would be a very popular game if released by one of the big publishers with more marketing money!).

In my youth I played LOTS of traditional games, so I'm not so fond of trick-taking games nowadays. Triumvirate, however, is a clever little game, supported by gorgeous art and colors, I enjoyed more than expected.
The actual winner of the single tricks is actually less important than which faction wins: the players secretly bid after each hand on one of the three factions, and when a faction wins three hands, the player who bid higher on that faction wins the game.
The subtlety of the game is due mainly to the fact that players keep cards between hands, while used cards are reshuffled and dealt, so that is quite simple to track which cards the opponent has.
Definitely want to try some more games...

This was a surprisingly good game. There are only a few card games that I really enjoy--my favorite being eucher. This has the same element of trick taking with a limited deck size, but adds an entire new layer of strategy. It doesn't matter how many tricks you win as long as you pledge (invest) in the correct color. I especially enjoyed being able to use the color that I lead to influence my opponent or confuse him about what colors I had previously pledged. This could be a great bluffing game with an opponent that you know well. I need to buy this one.

Of the "Indie B&C" games I picked up in Essen this certainly is my least favorite. The design is original an rather clever but the game fails to pull me in. We were just going through the motions without much excitement. Will try again to finalize my judgement. But for now it feels rather mÃªh to me.

Could not set myself to even try this again. Traded away.

Works well as a 2 player game.  It does seem to have a large luck element though, as I was able to get all (100% of) the big cards dealt to me in our first game and score a fairly easy win.  Perhaps this was a fluky occasion though, so more plays needed to get a better feel for this game!

RATING: 6
A unique trick-taking game in which you bet on a certain color winning the most tricks, while simultaneously decreasing the likelihood that that color will win with each bet. Certain double-think mechanics come into play, where you try to get into your opponent's mind and get them to think that you're thinking something else, but you never know what they're thinking, or what's in their hand.

Since you don't want to give away what color you want, you don't necessarily want to lead, but losing control of the lead can give the round over to your opponent. I have no idea how this game can be "mastered" due to so many unknowns and the luck of the draw, but it's a very interesting, engaging experience. Plus, who are we kidding, I'll never play this enough to get really good.

[floatleft][ImageID=558519][/floatleft] 
[b][thing=53168][/thing][/b] - [i]Triumvirate[/i] is a brilliant indie trick-taking card game for two players.  I had long been eyeing the game, but I had my heart set on a black 2009 BGG.con limited edition copy.  I finally acquired it thanks to my GCL buddy Roger.[floatright][username=leroy43][/floatright]  

I could not have been happier.  The game exceeded my expectations and has jumped right into the fray with [thing=760][/thing] as the pre-eminant two-player card game.  It may be slightly more luck-dependant than [i]Battle Line[/i], but it also leaves room for more cleverness and humanity.  

After that [i]very[/i] strong initial impression, my opinion of the game is starting to come down to earth a bit.  The more I explore what the game has to offer, the more it feels like a standard trick-taking game with a subtle twist, rather than an innovative game that simply borrows from the trick-taking genre.  

[i]Triumvirate[/i]'s central difference from other trick-taking games is in the pledging.  Throughout the game, players have the opportunity to pledge their support (in the form of cards) to one of the three politicians (suits) vying for the crown.  As players pledge to a given leader, there are fewer cards in the requisite color with which one can win tricks.  Initially, I saw this as akin to a small-scale stock-manipultation mechanic.  But the game imposes a hard cap of three pledged cards, making it extremely difficult for players to diversify, change courses, or use pledging for misdirection.  Additionally, I initially enjoyed the way in which pledging created an element of opponent-deduction.  I like having such mechanics in games.  But with experience, I've come to focus more on counting cards than on reading my opponent, which has diluted some of the enjoyment.  Perhaps with an equally skilled oponent, the game would provide a platform for us to manipulate each other a little more through card-based signalling.  But right now, playing against my particularly inexperienced and uninspired wife, I find the keys to success a bit too familiar (from my long-ago [thing=592][/thing]-playing days).  That the deisgner could make such a game eminently functional with two is quite the feat, I'm just less interested in exploring ground that feels so familiar.

[i]Triumvirate[/i] is a great light card game, and I still enjoy playing a great deal, but I'm begining both to question its novelty and to tire of games that depend on the presence of a player with the right skill-level and mindset to truly shine.  One thing that keeps [thing=760][/thing] on top of the genre is its accessibility to novice opponents. [i]Triuvirate[/i] takes a small bump down this week.

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play: First impressions are pretty damn good. I could seriously see this one becoming addictive and my rating rising. This is a really unique trick taker.

I can see that there's a lot of strategy here that will take me a few games to really understand. I really love the way players try to force the hands to end on their terms. Vying to get certain suits ahead and time the ending of a hand is really intriguing. Trying to decide between scoring points or pledging senators/mobs to void suits your opponent wants is going to take a few plays to get the hang of.

The one thing I'm not really sure I like is the pledging system. It's certainly a neat scoring system but my fear is that through subsequent plays, I'll begin to feel like I don't have enough control over what I can pledge. Opponents can easily force cards out of your hand during a hand, so being limited to what you have left over seems a little limiting. Perhaps I just don't have the hang of forcing the end of a hand before my opponent forces my good cards out though. :)

[u]April 2014:[/u] A trick-taking game for two! And it works. One game in particular made it click for us.

She was ahead in yellow and I was in black. Yellow and Red had two chairs and black only one. She thought she was in the lead in red with the 7 card bid. As a matter of fact I was in the lead there from having bid the 5 and 3 but I had spent all gae long trying to fight against red so she was confident I didn't want them to win. In the "last turn", she finally got the possibility of making red win but realized at the last moment the 5 and 3 had been missing for some time. As she could not make yellow win this turn and was unsure about red, she decided to make MY blacks win a second chair. So a last turn was played where she managed to force me to play yellow cards (I had nothing else...). A very interesting play which definitely made the game click for us, some bluffing, some nice tactical hand management... Although I still prefer other trick taking games with more players (belotte for example), this is a refreshing game and there is some good trick-taking goodness under the hood.

This is sort of Battle Line on steroids. But the conflict here is more indirect, thus there are more opportunities for clever play. Although in saying that, the game is superficially really quite different from Battle Line, since in essence, this is a trick taking game. But I believe it pushes similar buttons, although in a very different way. Very neatly done, and meatier than it appears at first sight. Wonderful, short, 2-player game with some depth.

Players are trying to back the winner of the Roman Civil War.  Two player trick taking game, with a deck of 0-9 in three colours (Caesar, Pompey and Crassus).  Winning a trick plonks a campaign token of that colour in Europe.  Win three campaigns, that colour gets to play a consul in Rome.  Three consuls in Rome wins the round.  Which player wins?  The player with the most legions (the 3, 5 or 7 of each suit) secretly pledged between rounds to the winning candidate.  Neat game that works, but I'm not sure how much is strategy and how much is pure luck.  Some hands seem to play themselves ... need to play more.  Bezique is still my trick taking for two game of choice.

This is a two player trick taking card game.  It's quick and it actually works as a game, but in the end I find it to be boring.  This almost reminds me of the premise of King of Siam in that you are trying to have the most influence in one of three factions (the influence is secret in this game and open in KoS) and then steer that faction towards the winning goal.  Maybe I am not seeing the subtleties that other have after repeated plays but I can think of a lot of two player games that I would rather play than this.  Do not take this as 'it's a bad game', because I think it could be good for the right person.

Alright, let's get this out of the way. I was asked by the designer to playtest this game. I was given a pre-production copy of this game, played the game, read the rules, and gave my feedback. From here out this comment is my opinion. I appreciated a free game, as anyone would, but I don't feel it sways my opinion significantly. Ok, onwards to the game.

Triumvirate is an interesting, indirect conflict card game for two players. It shares mechanics with a trick taking game, but as I wouldn't consider Battle Line a rummy game, I do not consider Triumvirate a trick taking game.

Keeping residual hands between rounds increases control of the game and adds an interesting new twist. The indirect conflict also adds new thought processes to a two player game. Knowing when to commit a card to your tableau is as important as understanding when to take the lead. Losing tricks at strategic times is also essential to a winning strategy. When a player is unable to follow suit, the winning card is the highest numbered card, which again breaks a traditional card game paradigm. All of this is layered into a just-for-two card game that takes concepts both new and old and forges them into a game that is distinctly unique.

(As of [b]2[/b] plays) A perfect, stripped-down, two-player take on the basic influence mechanics of [GAMEID=29937].

A fantastic little game packing a great deal of thought.

An innovative and thematic trick taking game for two players that actually works!  Not for everyone - would especially appeal to people who enjoy trick taking games, and are prepared to stick out the learning for a couple of games, because it has some unconventional aspects (you win by supporting the colour you think will win the most tricks, not by winning the tricks themselves).  Grows on you, don't judge it after your first play!

There seemed to be a lot of criticism about initial hands determining this game.  I think that is incredibly rare.  You'd have to have all the 7s and mobs and even then, it's easy for your opponent to force those out of your hand.  Oddly enough, I feel like the whole game is pointless until the last hand, and that is the one that actually determines the game.  In In the end, it's just not possible to force a color to win with all the legions pledged.  It's also not possible to keep them in your hand if the other player persists.  It's rather hard to explain the nuances, but a couple games under our belt we couldn't get around the fact that a card is almost always floating around at the end that will win the game for you.  It's almost always going to get pulled out in the hands, and it's just a matter of luck whether it comes back to you.  Still, if you don't mind that, I imagine it would be a fun, quick game.

Excellent trick-taking game for two. The tricks *you* win aren't as important as which faction the tricks are won for. Unlike spades, where you are bidding for the current hand - I like that the bidding (or "pledging") in Triumvirate requires predicting (and bringing to reality) the outcome of future hands. 

Beautiful components as well, in a nice compact package.

This is a solid little two player game.  As a big fan of trick taking games, it was a pleasant surprise to find a 2-player game that has the same feel as classic multi-player trick taking card games.  Definitely worth a look for anyone who likes card games and finds their game group to often be as low as 2.
** Bumping it up to a 8.0.  The more I play the game the more I enjoy it.  Even if you have a few stinker hands, the game is quick and enjoyable enough that you just play defensively for a bit and hope for more on the next shuffle.  This is quickly becoming a requested fav with my wife.

Making a functioning 2 player tricking taking game is an impressive feat. The low amount of cards means the choice of what gets pledged can affect cardplay dramatically by its absence. The persistent hands complicates the choice of what to play a great deal, you get to pace your own play to an extent don't in games where you play your entire hand.

Triumvirate is somewhat akin to if Konig von Siam were a trick taker. The similarity with KvS is that you are not an empire, but you are aligning yourself with an empire and pushing for that empire to win. However, unlike in KvS, you don't know where other player's alliances lay as they tuck away (up to three times per game) a single card which potentially gives them currency within a particular regime. All in all, this is such a cool little game with a lot of nuances for trick taking, taking cards out of circulation, and holding onto cards between rounds. Furthermore, the fact that you play up to seven rounds gives you some time (but not much) to get a feel for which potential Roman emperor the other is aligning themselves with, as well as which cards they might be holding onto between rounds. Too bad it is out of print!

My sister rates this game an "8". She likes to play it, as it fast, and she likes the simple trick taking mechanics. 

I would give it a "6", as I don't like indirect games a whole lot, and this game is more of an "indirect" game.

Triumvirate is an original trick-taking game that works for two players. As the designer himself told me, it seems counter-intuitive at first. I've only played a single game so I won't rate it yet. However, I believe it deserves at least a '7'.

2-player trick-taking game. Packs a lot of hand-management decisions into a tiny box. Not overly confrontational, which is oddly how I tend to prefer my two-player experiences (this is in stark contrast to my preferences for other player counts). Quite abstract, but the components are lovely.

This is a clever little 2 player stock market investing and manipulation game disguised as a trick taking game that mostly worked well (You actually invest in 1 of 3 'factions' secretly, so could be looked at as a silent auction game also). Unfortunately luck plays a huge role in the game limiting any control, and ATM I am not sure how to address this to improve the game. The Publisher suggested a somewhat admittedly convoluted deck stacking scheme (not tried by me) but I want to try the game again and give it a little more thought. 

A shame, because its otherwise a neat little game that would normally only work well with 3 or more but works very good with just 2 here.

RATING: 5
Very tentative rating after a single play.  I suspect there must be more game there than meets the eye given the level of general BGG interest.  However, it really didn't grab me.  Hopefully, I get some more opportunities to play and that it improves with play.

============================================

Played a few more times.  I feel like I must be missing something given the generally good reviews by others.  But, I just don't find the game interesting and/or fun.  I have it up for trade.  I may give it another go at some point if it doesn't trade.  But, given the number of other games I find more enjoyable, it's unlikely this will see table time anytime soon.

Now this I like. Trick taking game for two (only) in which who takes the trick isn't important (other than for purposes of controlling the lead), the real concern is which of the three suits wins the trick as behind the scenes you're essentially backing one of the suits to win.

The original thinking here moves it away from the usual whist variants.

The theme is extremely weak. Total paste on.  If you're looking for Roman themed, don't bother with this one.

Still, it works out as a fairly interesting 2-player trick-taking(?) game.  Takes a few plays to start grasping the real strategy.

RATING: 8.5
1st ed. A bigger game than expected in a little box.  The Pledging mechanism is what separates this 2-player card game from the rest of the trick-taking genre.  Whether you're Pledging a Legion card (3,5,7) for points or a Senator/Mob card to control the course of play, the depth of strategy and tactics remains comfortably balanced, regardless of card draw.  The rules are easy to follow while the game plays quickly, making Triumvirate an excellent 'filler' game.   

I found EndersGame's review most helpful.

This is a neat little card game. What I like the most about it are the subtleties hidden in the mechanics: from the fine balance in the legion cards (5+3 > 7, and pledging >7 guarantees the win, but limits your coverage to 2 colors), to the hidden information (7 guarantees the win if 5+3 are played in the last hand of the game or found in hand) to hand management (If my hand is not strong in my favored color, I should stall a round by playing lots of cards in other colors, preferably not the ones favored by my opponent and hoping for a favorable draw). There is some element of bluffing, but I haven't been able to maximize its potential yet because I find it quite easy to determine if the legions cards are gone or not. There is also an element of risk: pledging legion cards early limits your flexibility in case you need to change plan, but keeping those legion cards is risky if you don't have a lot of cards in that suit. Playing them is even more risky because you might not get it back but it can be a significant advantage since it can throw your opponent off-guard since they rarely expect a coveted legion card to be played voluntarily. In fact this might even be a bluff to indicate that you were forced to play legion cards, falsely indicating you have no more cards left in that color. 

This is in addition to the usual card counting and hand management found in trick taking games.

A trick-taking card game for 2 players.  But rather than trying to actually take the trick, players are usually just trying to ensure that particular tricks get taken...  An interesting twist and a well-themed game made even more impressive by the fact that it has been independently produced. 

It serves to remind me of how much I am [i]not[/i] a card player, however.  Had to trade it away as I believe I have actually developed a clinical condition causing cerebral arrest while playing any type of card game...

RATING: 7
I really appreciate this title, since it is pretty unique.  I'm interested in playing a little more, since it seems like some hands are pretty scripted.  It seems fairly deadly to never get dealt the point-scoring cards, but it seems like, because of the way the numbers are chosen (3 + 5 > 7) there's almost always a way out.  And if not, the game is quick enough that the amount of luck is not bothersome.

RATING: 6
Really keen to get a game in of this but I'm really disappointed in the artwork for the cards. It really is atrocious, I'd be embarrassed to sell this even given that it's a self published game. However, when it comes down to it, if it's a good game it'll be republished and hopefully the artwork is updated. If it's a good game which it appears to be I can forgive any artwork issues though.
--------------------------------------------------------
Well it was reprinted and the new artwork was great. It's now out of print and there's some interest in a reprint. I now slightly reget giving away my first edition copy, the pieces were excellent even if the cards were ugly. I've played the game finally and I'm glad I stuck with it. It's nice, not as elegant as I might have liked but there's a game here and you can't say that very often with 2p trick takers. Unfortunately I think I would still gravitate to WYSIWYG over this but it's a good backup, in a nice box supporting a great publisher.

Hmm.  Only one play (three games) of this, but in each of the three games, one guy hadn't seen more than one Legion card in any suit by the second hand, which means both players were pretty sure who was going to win.  I would try this again, but we went on to play 2-player Haggis and had a lot more fun.

As a big fan of trick taking games I really like this.  The intricacies are subtle but after you play several games and start to think about why you might pledge this card, or play out another color to dilute their hand, etc you really see what a gem it is.

I translated the rules for this game into Latin.

Triumvirate is a unique 2 player trick-taking game of indirect influence and carefully managed card play.  Optimal play is by no means obvious and each turn presents some tense decisions.  I have the impression that repeated play against the same opponent will be where this game really shines.  The Roman theme is an obvious plus to me as a Latin teacher.

I like trick-taking games, with my faves being Sticheln, Wizard, and Bottle Imp. We took a look at the rules for this and were utterly baffled. But once we started playing, it clicked. This is a supremely tricky game, and it takes a lot of finessing to get the result you want out of it. In the tie-breaking game I even felt I was screwed because, as luck had it, I got almost no scoring cards, and the ones I had were in a single color. I didn't see how I could get yellow to win, but I was able to play what I had to fish out a victory. I imagine as we all know the game more, that will get even harder to do.

Haggis is one of my favorite trick-taking games, and I love The Resistance, so I had high hopes for Triumvirate. After one play, though, we both agreed that it felt programmed -- the cards more or less tell you what to play, it's too easy to tell which color is going to win, and it's too hard to do much about it.

Playing best two out of three washes out some of the luck, but it still feels thin -- and in the same amount of time, I could be playing a better game.

Nice components and form factor, as always, but not really for me.

RATING: 5.5
Interesting little game. I'm not sure how much I like it yet. Others have commented that it's hard to wrap your head around the strategy, because you aren't necessarily trying to win tricks. I don't find that concept difficult or unique. What I do find interesting, however, is the scoring mechanism in this game. The pledge is what makes Triumvirate fun. You have to not only get points for yourself, but also limit your opponent's access to certain cards. The problem I have with this game is I don't feel like there's that much territory to be explored. In most games, once the various strategies are identified by players in a group, it really comes down to luck of the draw. The same is true here, but you seem to get to that point much faster. Maybe I'm over thinking it. To be fair, this is simply a filler game. It's not supposed to be epic or deep, but accessible and quick. In fact, this one can be played it 20-30 minutes, easy. I like it, and I think I'll hold onto it in order to pick at it a little more.

One of the most clever trick taking games I've played. Not sure how good I am but I love it.

RATING: 8.25
An excellent little 2 player trick taking game, that operates on multiple levels.  The colour (representing Caesar, Crassus and Pompey) that wins the most tricks in a hand scores a point, and the first colour to three points determines which player is the winner, based on what legion cards have been pledged by that player towards that colour (highest wins).   

The legion cards have a value of 7,5 and 3, so in determining influence over the colour, 5 + 3 will beat a 7.  This encourages holding on to the legion cards until you have an idea of who the likely winning colour will be (especially as there is a max of 3 cards to pledged in a game), but this risks legion cards being force played if short suited.  

Not just a matter of winning tricks, it is important to play to the over all strategy  in light of what cards you have already put in your pledge pile.  Plus there is the element of playing for the next hand if you don't have enough cards in the current hand for your desired colour to win 3 tricks. 

I expect that I'll be getting quite a few plays out of this. Rated 8.25 to begin, may go higher.

Finally got a play of this in tonight. I think the game has some definite depth, but it was hard to see it in my first run through. The concepts and the way you score points, the way cards disappear and become more scarce, and the subtleties of maintaining control of the round were all difficult to master after one play. For now, I put this at a 7, which basically means "I need to play it more before deciding what to do with it". I liked it, but don't have a complete grasp of how good the game can be.

Another abstract and another winner. A simple two player game with a lot of scope for bluffs and double-bluffs. Another quick and clean game with simple to learn rules. The production values are also very good and the Packaging is just about right - no wasted shelf space.

As for the theme, when asking which Triunvirrate this was (I suspect the first, as all sides are equally advantaged and poor old Lepidus really was the original âthird wheelâ) I was told it didn't matter one little bit.

I understand this is out of production at the moment. It's another one I would consider purchasing if the price was right and another ne I am unlikely to refuse playing.

A very clever little trick-taking-ish game with a 'comfortable' home-made feel (which is apt, being from a one-man publishing team). The overriding need for strategy won't appeal to everyone, but it is extraordinarily well balanced for a game which repeatedly tries to divide two by three. The rulebook is in need of a re-write with some clearer examples, although translating it into Latin is a work of inspired genius.

So-so 2 player game, too obvious choices imo.

RATING: 7
A clever trick-taking game for 2 players, where the winner of the tricks doesn't matter so much. It's all about what colour wins each trick, then what colour is the first to win 3 tricks (winning a hand) and then what colour is the first to win 3 hands. Whether you've secretly bet the most on that colour or not decides the winner. A clever part is that you get to keep unplayed cards after each hand, and played cards are shuffled and re-distributed, meaning you can mostly keep track of what's going to your opponent and where your strength might lie this hand to get the result you want. It's not perfect info though as 3 cards are kept out of play each hand, creating some tension on whether your tactics will work this turn - getting the right colour result for example may depend on whether they get 2 or 3 in that colour this turn; will they be shortsuited or not. Decisions each turn are whether to play or keep high cards and the ubertrump 0's, maybe living to fight another day. Another decision is whether to keep the 3 / 5 / 7's which can be used to trick take but are the only one's that will count in the secret scoring if you choose to tuck them away but which will leave you card short. All in all, a cute game with more than usually interesting hand management. A reason for not rating higher is I'm unsure how much replayability repeated trick-taking provides for 2 players without other attractions such as spatial considerations or special powers. Time will tell.

(5+ plays)  My wife likes trick taking card games.  I searched and searched for a decently rated 2 player trick taking game - and this one turned up.  The first two plays were very good.  We agreed there was likely a few dozen plays in this one before we play it out.

Quick and nice two player game. My only current issue with it is that it seems that after the first election you pretty much know what will happen, and though there is a possibility of forcing your opponent to use his legion cards to follow suit and put them back in the draw, getting that legion on the next draw is not guaranteed. In other words, what you get dealt on the first hand really matters, since only what is played gets reshuffled.
Despite that, this is a great trick taking game for two. The only other game I like that plays that well for two is "The bottle Imp".

I had high hopes for this as my wife is a card gamer at heart and this one's designed for two. We weren't disappointed, and it has the added bonus of being easily playable on a train. In some ways you could call it KÃ¶nig von Siam: the Card Game - it has similarly indirect play and questions of when to commit and when to stay flexible.

I like this game.  There aren't a lot of options for 2 player trick-taking but this one works.  The only thing I wish it had was more cards with more left out each hand.  After the first hand, it's just too darn easy to know what's going on, which can make subsequent hands feel almost programmed.  At that point, bidding becomes the important strategy and playing the hand out almost happens on it's own.

This is a Previously Owned game for me, but for the record, I agonized over it. 

I love trick-takers, and I am always interested to hear about trick-takers that work 2p. However, I don't need to own [i]all[/i] trick-takers that work 2p. This one is kind of cool, and is slightly wonky since your goal isn't necessarily to win a trick, but rather to influence a vote, and that's just slightly off-kilter enough where your brain struggles in a good way to parse the game. Good stuff there. 

But (you could sense a "but" coming) there was no way we'd ever choose this over Haggis or Innovation, though. That's not Triumvirate's fault, of course. It's worth checking out if you like 2p trick-takers. It just wasn't a top-tier game for any of my 2p card opponents, and I don't game enough where owning too many mid-tier games makes a lot of sense, even if they come in small boxes.

RATING: 7
Very clever two player trick-taking games. The core issue that two player trick-taking games have to address is: How do you distribute the cards in such a way so that the entire (or almost the entire) deck of cards have been seen by either of the players, but not change the game to one of perfect information.

Many ancient trick-taking games achieve this by having a draw-and-discard option (like Piquet) or by having players replenish their hand after playing to a trick (like Pinochle).

Triumvirate tackles this issue creatively by not having players play their entire hand of cards. Once a certain condition is met, all cards played to tricks are shuffled and redealt (minus three cards). In addition, players can discard cards from their hand for potential points.

Still, I suspect that this game might not be as deep as other existing two player games, but I don't think this is the point of this game; it's an incredibly quick and accessible two player game.

A very casual game. Has some interesting mechanics involved. It's taking me some time to decide if there's more to the game than basically blind bidding.

I don't think that I'll ever get rid of it from my collection as 2 player trick takers are hard to come by.  The issue is how much the games plays itself but it's a fun ride whilst it lasts, with some very tense rounds (e.g. when you know the other player has pledged a black 7 and you're trying everything to prevent black from winning the hand).

We also play-tested this, but we're not fond of trick-taking games, and found we didn't really take to it. Also, the luck of the opening deal seemed key to winning. On the up side: its very compact and would travel well, and makes a light filler for two.

In theory it seems like a nice idea. In practice I found the moves rather obvious. There's little room to deviate from sensible play and thus the game is a little bland. There's also not much in the way of repeat plays to be found here. Never mind, the game is quick, so there's not a lot of time invested in it. Nice components for a small print run game.

I've played twice, not counting a solo run-through to learn the game. It's good, unusual. The trick play is non-obvious because its purpose is quite different from traditional trick-taking: it's not about capturing cards, it's about leading the play around until you can force your favoured suit (the one to which you've pledged point cards) to finally pay off. I prefer trick-taking that is unrestricted (no need to follow suit, no forced plays) so that colours my impressions of the game. For the most part, it's standard trick-taking so, mechanically, its fine - just not my preference. The thing that makes it interesting is the indirect scoring and the need to manage your play over several hands rather than over just one. 

From the perspective of a single hand, the game is essentially highly dependent on who leads and who has which cards, its not highly flexible and the trick play can feel like being led around by the nose (you can't pull away once the person leading starts taking you down a path - if they have the cards they need). It's trick-taking on rails. What saves it, for me, is that the game isn't about a single hand, its about multiple hands, strung together, and the idea is to save cards that will let you be the one to put the Engineers cap on and ride the rails on a future hand. The game becomes one of look ahead, and strategy, with enough luck to keep it from being a dry perfect information game. I think it's a game that would reward repeated plays, where the person who had played more would win more often than not. I also think it's a game that would be best appreciated if played many times with the same opponent, so that the bluffing and second guessing elements would begin to play a stronger role - you can sense that those elements are there from the beginning, but it would take familiarity to bring them to their potential. It can be easy to suss out which cards the other player has pledged early in the game. I suspect experienced players will make that more difficult for each other. 

The game is well developed, there don't seem to be any awkward or unnecessary areas in the game play or in the rules. It's all quite clear and streamlined. It appears to be well balanced, although - being a card game - you can get hosed a bit on a single hand if you only get, say two of the cards in the colour you're supporting (you can't make that colour win the hand with only two cards). Still, it's not about one hand, so that's not so terrible. The game length is good. It lasts long enough to be interesting but doesn't overstay it's welcome. I think a lot of folks will like the theme and/or like that there is a theme at all.  Personally, I don't need a theme to enjoy the game and I can honestly say the theme tends to be entirely ignored as it has no real bearing on the game. But, it doesn't conflict with the game either, it doesn't get in the way, and it doesn't make things harder to understand - I suppose it may help tie things together better for those who need a theme.

In the end, I liked it. It's a good game. I'd play if someone asked me but I might not propose playing very often. It's a nice change of pace, and its unusual in its genre. Still, if it weren't for the scoring, I'm not sure I'd want to play it - due to the restrained trick-play, the individual hands lack the tactical flexibility I prize in most card games I enjoy.

Card, Trick-taking. Great 2p trick-taking game that works. Tricks don't yield points but help determine the winning color -- and only points you set aside during the game in that color count for victory. Tickles my mind in a good way while playing, trying to hide which color you're supporting while counting cards and manipulating the lead, etc. Good stuff!

I want to love the game but I only like it.  It's a trick-taking game with more than a few twists.  The most important one is that who wins a trick doesn't matter, except that it decides who leads the next trick.  The point of the game is to "invest" in the suit that wins the most tricks, iterated over a few hands.  I suspect that the strategic space (and player control) is limited.  As I say, I like it, but I am not fully convinced.  The rating could go up or down.

I am/was one of the playtesters.  Triumvirate is an excellent little game, the perfect filler while waiting for players or to tend a night.  There is strategy there, though it can occasionally feel as though there's no hope due to your card draw.

The game is short enough, however, that the weight of luck doesn't really impact my enjoyment.  One game of bad luck means 10 minutes gone and some good karma for the next time 'round.

My copy is a pre-production copy from Travis Worthington, the designer.  I was very, very impressed with the work he put in.  It looks very much like a finished product.

Quick, cunning game, with opportunities for "thinking in reverse" for getting what you want by manipulating your opponent and not always taking the obvious approach.  This suits me very well (I like Zertz, for example).
The theme is attractive, being a Rome fan, and surprisingly thematic for a very short card game.
Quality of the components is very good.  I particularly like the satin finish of the wooden pieces and the choice of slighty muted but rich colours.

I have 2 playtest versions of this--one with just the cards and the more recent version with the board and bits as well.  This is a very solid two player trick-taking game with a cool over-arching strategy which manipulates your tactical play.  It's quick but not shallow as there is enough time to develop your strategy.  

If you truly just play a single game, which is only about 15 minutes, luck will play a significant role.  If you really want to smooth out the luck curve, simply play it more like the card game it is (rather than a radically abstracted historical simulation), and play best four out of five.

Unusual trick-taking game for two. Capturing (or not-capturing) tricks is not really the point. There are three suits and you're basically trying to invest in the suit that will come out on top by the end of the game. In a nutshell, whenever a suit wins a trick, that suit gets a point. When a suit gets three points, it wins a vote. When a suit gets three votes, it wins and however much you have invested in that suit counts toward your score. You can be flexible and invest in all three. Or you can put all your eggs in one basket -- however, investments are made with cards in that suit which are taken out of the game, making it more difficult for you to steer that suit to victory.

Interesting, and another nice two-player to add to my collection. There's always room for good two player games.

I'm liking Triumvirate so far.  It's a trick taking game that actually works for two players.  It has some clever mechanisms in it that works to give you the feel of typical four player trick taking games.

If those games aren't your bag, you won't find anything new here, but if you're looking for that feeling for two players.  I don't think you can go wrong here, or that you've really honestly got another choice that would be any better.

RATING: 6
After every phase you can put aside face down 1 card. In a whole round you can put aside up to 3 cards. The scoring cards has the values 3, 5 and 7 and they`re in 3 colours. So when you put aside a 7 you don`t have majority. But you leave all cards that you don`t played for the next phase. So when you put aside a black 7 and have in your hand a black 3 or 5, then you will have majority. But sometimes you must play that cards. They will be shufflred and give to the players randomly.

The goal is to have majority in 1-2 colours and let to win that colour. Only that colur that win 3 rounds will score. The problem is the player will divide the majorities. The cards are put aside face down, but you will see what cards come into play, what not and how your opponent play. There`re some place for bluffing, but in the middle part of the game every player will know where the opponent has majority. 

Play that your coluers win seems to be random. You need the right cards to do so. So during the game you have many choices, but at the winner must have luck. Maybe after few plays you will see, that the game is not so random? 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
As the designer this might be biased but I really do like this game and would rate it a 9 - but now that the game has reached 30 ratings I have removed my ranking.  

Why a 9?  It plays fast but is full of interesting decisions, deduction and just enough card tracking for my tastes.  I also like the way the play ebbs and flows, something that is pretty rare in a game that takes 10-15 minutes to finish (in person!).  Plus I almost always win! 

Its really a game that you should play a couple times in a row as there is some luck in the initial deals, but likewise the variability of opening hands and in game shuffles makes each play different and requires a constant reevaulation of your best moves.  The ability to hold cards between hands makes it more than just a game of tactics.  

For me a game should give you back enjoyment in porportion to your time commitment - I feel as though I get at least 20-30 minutes of enjoyment in this game, and its only 10-15 minutes long.  Thats a pretty good ratio, especially since you can play it again and be faced with an entirely different set of decisions.

Why not a 10?  

I wouldn't rate any game (right now) a 10, I like to play a lot of new games.  Learning a game and analzying a strategy to win is a big thrill for me, perhaps why I like Triumvirate so much.  The closest to a 10 for me would be Tigris if you could play this in person with a timer as is done online at gametable.  Chicago Express is a great one, near a 10 for me.  Tichu is another strong game if you play online and finish in around 45 minutes.  I like Metrpolys, but still undecided if there is as much strategy as appears.  I also think highly of King of Siam, which was the inspiration for Triumvirate, though KoS can bring out the AP in too many players.  I will play any game once though and will almost always play a new game over one I've played before.

LOVE! LOOoVe it! Triumvirate is a counterintuitive little two-player trick-taking game, and I use that descriptor in the best sense, i.e., of it being intriguing, nuanced, full of surprises, risks, and calling upon a hefty degree of social cognition. Overall, though they are completely dissimilar games in terms of their play, I would put Triumvirate in the same league as Battle Line, in that I see it as not just a filler, but as a compelling game in its own right, to be played repeatedly, and which I think about even when not playing.

Triumvirate is very clever, but my wife was pretty succinct in summing up the downside here: it's something of a one-trick pony. Or, more accurately, while Triumvirate is clever, it's not deep. Once you figure out that you need to "pledge" some combination of legion cards from the suit(s) you support and horde (0) cards frm the suits you don't, the game becomes fairly routine. It may take quite a few hands to "get" what's going on here, but once you do, there's just not enough happening to hold your interest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Interesting two player trick-taking card game. It doesn't really matter what tricks a player takes; it only matters that the player ends up with the right card(s) in hand and the chosen color wins enough hands to make it to the top of the Triumvirate. Definitely a solid game that will need more plays to explore the depths it has to offer.

RATING: 3
Very tricky card game in which players throw their public political support behind certain Triumvirate members and their private military support behind others. Public support selects the emperor, but private armies in support of that emperor win the game.

The theme is fantastically realized for such a slim game, and it plays quick but feels unlike the trick-taking game it pretends to be on the surface. I can't get past the initial randomness to enjoying this game more. Maybe there isn't a whole lot to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I have playtested this game with a couple of my game groups.  Play seems to be dominated by the luck of the deal.  If you are dealt the high cards/mobs, you will be able to dominate the lead. All that really matters in this game is control of the lead, even if you sometimes intentionally give it away.  There are not enough hands in a given game to smooth out the luck curve.

Perhaps if you could optionally toss any number of cards into the discard before dealing between hands there would be more control?  Or perhaps if after the cards were dealt, each player could optionally toss 1 or 2 cards face down into the blind?

The game is short enough that playing it can still be fun despite the luck.

I'd rate this game a 7 or perhaps an 8 when two people with a dozen or so games under their belt play against each other.

RATING: 7
An excellent 2p card game with surprising depth for its brief playing time. There's just enough imperfect information to allow for uncertainty and bluffing, but not so much that chaos overwhelms strategy. After a few plays to grok the game, it becomes clear that the initial distribution of 7's shapes the overall game significantly, but there are still several possible strategies from there, depending on the details of the particular deal. Playing a set of games should even the initial deals somewhat, and the game is fast enough to set up and play that you could easily finish a best 2 out of 3 set in 45 minutes, probably even a 3 out of 5 set once you're more experienced. Being a sucker for Romans, I also love the theme. While there's nothing in the theme that's absolutely necessary to the gameplay (this is not Republic of Rome by any means), several elements are fitting enough to at least be evocative.

Took a second play to 'get it'. What a great card game for 2 - love it. Some really tasty decisions to be made but still a nice and quick, easy to play game. Similar decisions to feeding the monkey in mystery rummy's murders in the rue morgue

Jaipur is prettier, but Triumvirate is meatier. 

Feels like at least some critics miss the point on this one.  Winning tricks is only one part of this game.  It's not even necessarily required to win.  You win by pledging the highest number of legion cards to the winning color. There's a lot more depth here than some are seeing.

Small trick taking game,  I appreciate the amount of potential information you're provided in the game for eventual decisions.

Bon jeu de cartes avec des Ã©lÃ©ments des jeux de levÃ©es (dont le Rook). Or, gagner une levÃ©e est un moyen et non une fin pour gagner Ã  ce jeu. Original.

Rating may go up after a few more plays. I definitely haven't figured out the card play yet. I'm a big fan of the whole series (Haggis, The Resistance).

Quite an interesting game.  I like the mechanism of putting cards away to try and win the suits - it makes for some interesting decisions.  Eager to play this one again soon.

As a trick-taking game for two this title stands out. It has mechanics that work with the theme, quick play time, various strategies and almost always runs high on tension. Simple but with enough depth to be engaging every time.

Okay, so first impressions are a little mixed.  The design is sound, and actually works well as a trick-taking game for two players.  It's more than just following the particular card led; knowing when to take the lead back, and how to manipulate the "markets" give the game a little extra OOMPH that you wouldn't expect from a basic trick-taking game.  I'm not sure how much control the game gives you, since you can work that game toward your own goal by holding on to certain cards, and waiting to play others as trump or play-off cards, but when you reshuffle everything that's been played back into the mix, it can add some unwanted chaos into the game.

The game is more intricate than you would think at first glance.  Cards committed to the pledge are out of the game, and the more cards you pledge of one color, the less likely it will be to receive that third vote.  Additionally, you want to commit the high cards to the pledge, but that removes the high cards from the tricks.  Plus, near the end of the game, the less-pledged color will start making a comeback, since it has more cards left in the game.  It's a weird little characteristic, but not necessarily bad.  I'm just not sure how to manage that aspect of the game just yet.

On the banks of the Rubicon a legionnaireâs footstep brings Civil War and sets upon a course of events from which an emperor will emerge. How will you master the battles that are to come on the field, in the senate and through the streets of Rome?

Triumvirate is a fast paced game for two that requires subtle hand management and card play to win consistently. The mechanisms in the core rules make for a very satisfying, imperfect information player trick taking game. In addition to the core game there is a drafting variant that removes randomness from play beyond the initial card deal. I have included both variants in the rule set as I found players to have a preference for either one or the other style of play.

The game is meaty enough to be a good "filler" for gamers, but subtle enough to be enjoyed by significant others.

I like the concept of indirect play, and while the hands were occasionally tense, the large percentage of cards in play, that there are only two players and especially the need to follow suit means too often the lead player can force all 3 tricks in the color they want. I think it might be more fun with the drafting variant, but I'm concerned that might lengthen the game too much. It's not bad, but I'd rather play some of the traditional trick-taking games.

Interesting two player trick taking game.  A bit luck dependent (it is a card game after all with only 27 cards).  Well worth having in the collection.

I love Rome and Roman stuff, I love Julius Caesar, this game is perfect. I like that it is simple, quick and easy two player, great for in between times during elimination games. Fun and easy to play.

Interesting 2-player card game that feels like some strange, backwards trick-taker. It's a clean design, but I'm still exploring how much control one really has over the final outcome.
